Toyota says overall Thai auto sales in June drop 70 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix overline

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's depressed economy sent
automobile sales in June down 70.8 percent compared to the previous
year, Toyota Motors Corp. said Thursday.
	   Sales of cars plunged from 36,503 units in June 1997 to 10,641
in June 1998, according to figures released by Toyota, which tracks
industry-wide sales in Thailand.
	   About 90 percent of vehicles sold in Thailand are made by
Japanese automakers.
	   Often called ``the Detroit of Asia,'' auto industry analysts had
predicted more than a million cars would be sold in Thailand by the
year 2000. But the onset of a financial crisis has led to sharply
lower sales.

Prince Charles offers paintings to help save child prostitutes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles has offered limited edition prints
of one of his own watercolors to raise funds for a hostel in Nepal
which rescues girls from child prostitution, the tabloid Sun
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The prince hopes to raise more than 50,000 pounds (dlrs 82,000)
for the Maiti Nepal Hostel in Katmandu, Nepal, which he visited in
February.
	   ``This is something that he has never done before and is not
likely to be repeated,'' the Sun quoted an unnamed aide of the
prince's as saying.
	   Other watercolors by the prince, an amateur painter, have been
sold as lithographs to help raise money for his charitable trusts,
but a limited print run has never been made of one of his
watercolors, The Sun said.
	   In a personally signed letter published in The Sun, Prince
Charles told how he found the sufferings of the girls, rescued
mainly from brothels in Bombay, India after being lured there with
promises of jobs in carpet factories, ``grimmer and even more
heartbreaking than I could have imagined.''
	   He has agreed that 500 framed prints of a watercolor he painted
of a Himalayan mountain range while on a private trekking trip in
1992 can be sold as part of the appeal for funds for the hostel,
which offers a refuge for girls who have been sold into
prostitution.
	   The limited edition prints are on offer for 150 pounds (dlrs
245,000) each through the newspaper.
	   During the prince's visit earlier this year, he met many of the
girls saved by the hostel, run by Anuradha Koirala, 47.
	   ``The money you raise will dispel the chronic uncertainty of
their daily existence and make an immense and very real difference
to their lives,'' he told the newspaper's readers in the letter.
	   ``The girls' tale of abuse and exploitation were truly
appalling,'' he wrote. ``But there was, at the same time, a
heroism, a selfless dedication and sacrifice about Anuradha, who
was living under constant threat of retribution from the
traffickers, which I found both uplifting and humbling.''

Drug-ridden Chinese province launches crackdown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's most drug-ridden province has begun
setting up a new police bureau to coordinate a crackdown on the
manufacturing, trafficking and use of drugs, a state-run newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   The new bureau in Yunnan, a southwestern Chinese province
bordering Southeast Asia's drug-producing ``Golden Triangle''
region, will double the number of police involved in drug fighting,
the China Daily reported.
	   The 2,000-member force, the first of its kind in China, will
focus on eradicating plants used to make drugs, and stamping out
drug manufacturing, trafficking and abuse, the newspaper said.
	   Yunnan police have seized more than 70 tons of narcotics _ or 80
percent of the total amount of smuggled drugs in China _ since the
early 1980s, the newspaper said.
	   Last year, the province seized 4,073 kilograms (8,960 pounds) of
heroin, 1,132 kilograms (2,940 pounds) of opium and 16.9 kilograms
(37.18 pounds) of the designer drug ``ice.''
	   China had 540,000 registered drug addicts, about 85 percent of
them under the age of 35, at the end of last year.

Mexico expels two Italians suspected of drug smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police in the Caribbean resort of Cancun
arrested and expelled two Italians, saying they had been trailing
the men for six months and accusing them of links to the Mafia.
	   Oreste Pagano and Alberto Minelli were wanted by authorities in
the United States, Canada and Italy, the attorney general's office
said in a statement. It called Pagano an important figure in the
Italian Mafia.
	   Immigration officials on Wednesday expelled the two men to
Italy, saying both were in Mexico illegally because Pagano was
carrying a forged Venezuelan passport and Minelli couldn't prove he
had been admitted legally.
	   The attorney general's office said the men were involved in drug
smuggling in Mexico, but didn't elaborate.

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Pedro Martinez pitched a four-hitter to outduel
Bartolo Colon in a matchup of All-Star pitchers as the Boston Red
Sox beat the Cleveland Indians 1-0 Wednesday night on a homer by
seldom-used Midre Cummings.
	   Martinez (12-3) struck out nine and walked two in his second
shutout this season and third complete game. He improved to 6-1 in
his last seven starts and faced just two batters over the minimum
through his first seven innings.
	   Colon (9-5) gave up seven hits in eight innings after going 5-0
in his six previous starts.
	   Colon, the winning pitcher in the All-Star game, and Martinez,
who was chosen but not used by Cleveland and AL manager Mike
Hargrove, began the day first and second in the AL in ERA. And they
kept the game scoreless for 4{ innings.
 &UR; White Sox 9, Blue Jays 3, 1st Game
 &UR; White Sox 5, Blue Jays 2, 2nd Game
	   In Chicago, Albert Belle hit a two-run homer in both games to
lead Chicago to the sweep.
	   Belle's homer in the second game was his ninth in his last eight
games and the 299th of his career.
	   In the first game, Belle, Robin Ventura and Ray Durham each
homered to support Jaime Navarro (8-10).
	   In the nightcap, rookie Mike Caruso hit a tiebreaking two-run
homer with two outs in the fifth to spoil Dave Stieb's first start
since 1993 and give the White Sox their sixth win in seven games.
	   Toronto also tied an unusual record in the second game when they
had three batters hit by pitches in one inning.
	   Belle connected for a two-run homer in the first inning of the
second game, his 27th. In the opener, he hit a two-run homer in the
fourth.
	   It is Belle's hottest stretch since he hit 10 home runs in seven
games from Sept. 18-27, 1995, while with Cleveland.
	   Stieb (0-1), making his first start since May 22, 1993, when he
was a member of the White Sox, gave up four runs and seven hits
with two walks over six innings.
 &UR; Yankees 11, Tigers 0
	   In Detroit, Hideki Irabu pitched eight strong innings and New
York hit three home runs in the eighth inning.
	   Chuck Knoblauch hit a three-run homer, Jorge Posada hit a
two-run drive and Paul O'Neill had a solo shot in the eighth off
reliever Doug Bochtler.
	   Knoblauch drove in four runs and O'Neill and Posada were 3-for-5
as the Yankees won for the 12th time in 13 games. Ricky Ledee and
Tim Raines added RBI doubles.
	   New York is 6-1 on its 11-game trip and leads the majors with a
34-15 road record. At 67-21, the Yankees matched the 1902
Pittsburgh Pirates for the best 88-game record for any team this
century.
	   Damion Easley had two singles for the Tigers, who have dropped
19 of their last 22 games against the Yankees.
	   Irabu (8-3), who didn't last more than 5 2-3 innings in any of
his last four starts, gave up five hits.
	   Rookie Seth Greisinger (1-4) took the loss.

UN envoy arrives in Indonesia hoping for E. Timor breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A United Nations special envoy arrived
in Indonesia Wednesday, hopeful that political changes in the
Southeast Asian nation will lead to a breakthrough ending more than
two decades of bloodshed in the territory of East Timor.
	   ``This is an opportune time to see what we can do to expedite a
solution,'' said Jamsheed Marker, who has been brokering
negotiations over the future of East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony.
	   ``There is a general will on all sides to arrive at a peaceful
solution, which means consultations of a very intensive kind,'' the
U.N. envoy said.
	   Despite warnings from the government and local authority figures
alike, Marker said he would press ahead with a planned visit to
East Timor within the next few days.
	   The Indonesian government, along with East Timor's Roman
Catholic bishop and Nobel peace prize winner Carlos Belo have
cautioned against such a visit due to fears of violent
demonstrations.
	   During Marker's last visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers
killed two pro-independence protesters.
	   Last month, security forces killed two other activists in East
Timor during protests held to impress three visiting European
ambassadors.
	   Rival groups, either for or against Indonesian rule over the
disputed territory, have clashed repeatedly. Tens of thousands of
people have left East Timor in the past few weeks, fearing that the
violence might escalate.
	   Tensions have also heightened ahead of the 22nd anniversary of
Indonesia's annexation of the territory on Friday.
	   Marker appealed for calm in East Timor, which has endured
guerrilla war and human rights abuses since 1975, when it was
invaded by Indonesia.
	   ``There is a genuine dialogue which is going on now,'' he said.
``This dialogue should be permitted to take place in a calm
atmosphere.''
	   Marker said he planned to meet peace prize winner Belo,
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and
imprisoned East Timor guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   Habibie came to power in May after former President Suharto
quit, ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto ordered the invasion and the 1976 annexation and later
steadfastly refused to make compromises over East Timor.
	   However, Habibie recently offered to release Gusmao and to grant
some autonomy to East Timor in return for international recognition
that it is an integral part of Indonesia.
	   The United Nations and many governments do not recognize
Indonesia's territorial claim.
	   Marker said he hoped to convene a meeting soon between the
foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal along with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan.

UNDATED: 10th save.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Reds 4, Cardinals 2, 11 innings &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire's throwing error in the 11th inning
gave Cincinnati its 10th straight victory.
	   The Reds came from behind in all three games of the series,
overcoming a 5-0 deficit Monday and a 4-2 margin Tuesday. They
trailed 2-0 Wednesday before tying it in the eighth on an RBI
single by pinch-hitter Melvin Nieves, then won on McGwire's sixth
error of the season.
	   The Reds' winning streak is their longest since a 10-game run in
July 1975. The club record is 12 in a row in 1957 and 1939.
	   Cincinnati has won 15 of 16, its best sustained stretch since an
identical run in 1975 as the Big Red Machine. The Reds also have
won 10 in a row on the road.
	   McGwire made two nice fielding plays at first base earlier in
the game. But in the 11th, Bret Boone beat out an infield hit and
McGwire, trying to get Sean Casey at home, threw the ball wide of
the plate. Eddie Taubensee also scored from second on the play.
	   Gabe White (4-3) worked 2 1-3 scoreless innings as the Reds beat
the Cardinals for the sixth consecutive time this season.
	   John Frascatore (1-3) was the loser.
 &UR; Giants 5, Dodgers 3 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, the Bulldog showed he's still got some bite in a
triumphant return to Dodger Stadium.
	   Orel Hershiser, a star for 12 years with the Dodgers before
leaving after the 1994 season, pitched six strong innings for San
Francisco.
	   Hershiser, nicknamed ``Bulldog'' by former Los Angeles manager
Tommy Lasorda, was pitching at Dodger Stadium for a team other than
the Dodgers for the first time in his career. He played for Los
Angeles from 1983-94, and ranks 10th on the franchise's victory
list with 134 wins.
	   The 39-year-old Hershiser (8-7) pitched on three days' rest as a
replacement for left-hander Shawn Estes, missing a turn due to
tenderness in his pitching shoulder.
	   He allowed five hits and three runs _ two earned _ while walking
two and striking out four before being removed for a pinch-hitter.
	   Backup catcher Brent Mayne had two hits including his third
homer and drove in three runs as the Giants snapped a five-game
losing streak.
 &UR; Padres 6, Rockies 2 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Kevin Brown won his eighth straight decision and tied
a career-high by striking out 10, and Steve Finley hit a three-run
homer.
	   Greg Vaughn and Wally Joyner added three hits apiece for the
Padres, who improved to 22-6 against NL West opponents and a
franchise-high 27 games over .500 (61-34).
	   Brown (11-3), whose last loss came May 21 at Pittsburgh, gave up
a season-high 12 hits but pitched around several broken-bat
bloopers. He walked one in his third complete game.
	   Finley's homer off Jamey Wright (5-9) was his seventh of season
and gave San Diego a 5-2 lead in the fourth.

Mariners slugger doesn't want to talk about home runs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM COUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Ken Griffey Jr. would rather discuss why he's not
talking about his home runs than why he's hitting them at a record
pace.
	   ``I'm not talking about home runs. I want W's,'' Griffey said
Wednesday before the Seattle Mariners played the Minnesota Twins.
``When you talk about a majority of great players, they've been
winners. I care more about my team than I do myself.''
	   After hitting two homers Tuesday night to give him 39 for the
season, one behind St. Louis' Mark McGwire, Griffey declined to
discuss his performance. On Wednesday, he took exception to a
newspaper article that called him uncooperative.
	   ``Because I don't want to talk about myself, does that make me a
bad person?'' Griffey asked a group of reporters about 90 minutes
after he finished batting practice.
	   Griffey cares about his public image, though. He wasn't going to
enter the All-Star game home run derby at Coors Field last week
until he was booed. Then he went out and won it.
	   And he's not really thinking about Roger Maris' single-season
home run record of 61 because ``I'm still doing it.''
	   ``When someone gets close to something, people start talking,''
Griffey said. ``But I'm not really close. I've still got to get to
40 and then 50 and some of 60. Nobody has pulled me over in the
express lane and say, `Let's talk about this.' But the record's
fine. I have no problem with the record.''
	   His two homers Tuesday gave him 333 in his 10-year career, good
for 60th place on the all-time list. Joe Adcock is No. 59 at 336.
	   ``I don't go up there thinking about home runs,'' he said. ``If
you get enough hits, sometimes the ball will go out of the
ballpark. But you can't go up there thinking about home runs
because then you tighten up.''
	   The Mariners entered Wednesday's game in last place in the AL
West with a 41-53 record.

Lightning kills 14, injures 42 others in south China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A bolt of lightning killed 14 people and slightly
injured 42 others in southern China who had sought shelter from a
storm in a building, a state-run newspaper reported.
	   The storm struck on the local market day last Friday in Yungui
village in Guizhou province, sending people scurrying to get out of
the rain, the Yangcheng Evening News reported Wednesday.
	   More than 50 people gathered in a new brick building to wait out
the storm when a sudden flash of lightening hit and ``14 people
dropped down dead,'' the newspaper said.
	   The report did not provide further details.
	   Meanwhile, in neighboring Sichuan province, a passenger bus
overturned and plunged into a river on Tuesday, killing one person
and leaving 19 others missing, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported Thursday.

Indonesian president condemns rapes which took place during riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's president has condemned as
``inhuman'' the rape of dozens of women and girls during riots two
months ago and has promised to prevent it from happening again,
local news reports said Thursday.
	   Women's groups say at least 168 women were sexually assaulted,
including 20 who died as a result of the attacks.
	   The riots which broke out across the country led to the
resignation of former President Suharto, who ended 32 years in
power. About 1,200 people died in the violence. Thousands of homes
and buildings were looted and burned.
	   ``I express my deepest regret at the violence which runs counter
to the nation's cultural values,'' Habibie said in a speech to
women's groups Wednesday.
	   ``I promise the government will be proactive in giving
protection and security to all layers of society to prevent a
repetition of this inhuman episode of history of the nation,'' he
said.
	   It was Habibie's first direct condemnation of the rapes that
activists say were mainly carried out against members of
Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
population. But they dominate industry and commerce and have become
the scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Many Chinese are Christians and Buddhists, while most other
Indonesians are Muslims.
	   The National Human Rights Commission has accused the military
and the government of not having done enough to control May's
violence or to protect women during the crisis.

Australia to open some postal services to competition from 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government announced
plans on Thursday to deregulate the country's state-run postal
service by allowing competition for price and delivery time on
items weighing more than 1.7 ounces (50 grams).
	   Communications Minister Richard Alston promised the reforms
would not lead to a raising of the cost of mailing a standard
letter.
	   Items weighing less the amount subject to price competition will
be subject to a price fixed until at least the year 2003, meaning
private mail carriers can only compete for this type of mail on the
basis of faster delivery times, the minister said.
	   Australia Post currently has a price and delivery monopoly on
all packages weighing less than 8.8 ounces (250 grams).
	   The changes follow a review of Australia Post by the country's
National Competition Council and will take effect from July 1,
2000.
	   Other reforms announced Thursday include ending Australia Post's
monopoly on handling incoming international mail, introducing
discounts for bulk mailers who use bar-codes, dropping the limit on
bulk mail discounts from 2,500 items to 300 and tendering out
sections of postal delivery routes.
	   But the federal government rejected the council's recommendation
that all of Australia Post's business mail be deregulated.
	   Australia Post managing director Graeme John said the reforms
would not mean closures of post offices.
	   Under the changes, about 88 percent of Australia Post's business
would be open to competition, John said.

Chinese dissidents petition for release of comrades
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ One hundred Chinese dissidents have petitioned
for the release of five democracy campaigners detained for
organizing an illegal opposition political party, a rights group
said Thursday.
	   Addressed to President Jiang Zemin and Premier Zhu Rongji, the
petition said the detentions ran contrary to government pledges to
improve human rights and sign the United Nations Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights.
	   ``We call on the central government to immediately redress these
wrongful violations of human rights,'' said the petition, released
by the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China.
	   Police rounded up nine organizers of the China Democracy Party
last Friday and on Wednesday captured a tenth member who had been
on the run. He and four others remain in custody, but five of those
detained have since been released.
	   The crackdown marks the most concerted police action against a
dissident group in several years.
	   Three of those under arrest announced the formation of the China
Democracy Party on June 25, the day U.S. President Bill Clinton
began his nine-day China visit.
	   But authorities, intolerant of challenges to the ruling
Communist Party's monopoly on power, refused to register the party,
as required by law.

Amnesty International urges Myanmar to improve rights record
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With the 10th anniversary of Myanmar's
failed democracy uprising approaching, London-based Amnesty
International is urging the military government to avoid possible
violence by improving human rights.
	   ``As this important anniversary approaches, we hope that you
will begin to defuse possibilities for conflict by taking immediate
steps towards improving the human rights situation,'' Amnesty's
International Secretary General Pierre Sane said Thursday.
	   His comments were contained in an open letter to Gen. Than Shwe,
leader of the military government.
	   Sane suggested releasing political prisoners who were old and
sick, freeing jailed members of democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's
political party and ending repression against candidates who won a
1990 election the military refused to honor.
	   August 8th will be the tenth anniversary of the day when
millions of people across Myanmar, then called Burma, demanded an
end to 26 years of military rule and the installation of a
democratic government.
	   The military responded with brutal force, gunning down at least
3,000 protesters, including Buddhist monks, and jailing thousands
of others.
	   Rumors of planned civil disobedience inside Myanmar on the
anniversary have been circulating in Myanmar exile communities in
Bangkok.
	   The anniversary ``holds great symbolic significance for the
Burmese people and for the international community. Amnesty
International is deeply concerned, therefore, about the potential
for heightened tension at this time between the authorities and
political activists,'' Sane wrote.
	   ``This has been reflected over the past few weeks by political
arrests and increased restrictions and surveillance of opposition
leaders,'' he added, referring to the recent beating of members of
Aung San Suu Kyi's party by government security forces as they
tried to visit her compound.

Foreign minister leads race to succeed Hashimoto, young lawmakers
</HEADLINE>
unhappy
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two senior members of Japan's ruling party moved
Thursday to succeed outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
is to step down before the end of the month over his party's recent
humiliation at the polls.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi was the apparent front-runner in
the race, having reportedly won the support of a large faction
within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
	   Obuchi already is a leader of the party's largest faction, run
by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Newspapers reported that
support within the party has largely been built up because of
intense lobbying by Takeshita himself.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally announce his candidacy during
the next two days to replace Hashimoto.
	   Also expected to announce his candidacy for the prime
ministership was Seiroku Kajiyama, a former Chief Cabinet Secretary
and LDP stalwart. Japan's Kyodo News reported that Kajiyama on
Thursday had informed other party leaders of his intentions.
	   Kajiyama aides refused to confirm that report, but said an
announcement would likely be made soon.
	   Most analysts agree the LDP's weekend defeat in elections for
half the seats in the upper house of Parliament was a stunning
rebuke by voters of how Hashimoto handled Japan's recession-bound
economy.
	   Obuchi has told the public nothing about what he would do to
turn the economy around. Instead, he has followed the Japanese
tradition of trying to win the post through back room consensus
building with other party powerbrokers.
	   That approach has angered younger members of the party, who are
openly calling on the party to stop the clubby politics that they
blame for the party's defeat.
	   Faction politics is exactly what the ruling party must shed if
its to regain the support of the voters, they argue.
	   On Thursday, a former minister of trade and international
industry, Shinji Sato, said he was quitting the Takeshita faction
to protest the manner it had been supporting Obuchi's bid.
	   ``The party only has eyes for factions, not for the people and
their concerns,'' said Shojiro Watanabe, a campaign advisor for
several LDP lawmakers.
	   The Liberal Democrats are expected to hold a vote next Tuesday
to decide their next party president. The party's leader is
virtually assured of becoming prime minister because of the LDP's
majority in Parliament's lower house.
	   Formal approval of the new prime minister was expected before
the end of July.

Singapore Auditor-General discovers lapses in government accounts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Auditor-General has uncovered 300
million Singapore dollars (dlrs 177 million) in errors or
improprieties during its annual government examination, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Although the government's overall financial accounting for the
fiscal year 1997-98 was in proper order, the Auditor-General said
in its report that it discovered 70 categories of irregularities,
according to The Straits Times.
	   These included poor accounting practices, misuse of funds,
improper and unauthorized payments, and fraudulent claims, the
newspaper said.
	   The Auditor-General is responsible for examining the accounts of
the government and its related agencies, boards and some
government-linked companies.
	   Auditor-General Chuang Kwong Yong said the annual report
highlighted ``some of the occasional serious lapses when public
monies and stores have not been properly controlled or used, when
revenue has not been collected or when expenditure has not been
incurred in accordance with proper authority.''
	   For example, Singapore's subordinate courts had 122,000
Singapore dollars (dlrs 72,000) in unidentified accounts due in
part to alimony payments that were not properly accounted for. It
has since instructed divorced men to pay maintenance allowances
directly into their ex-wive's accounts.
	   The Ministry of Defense was chastened for a 22.8 million
Singapore dollar (dlrs 13.5 million) expenditure last August that
was not authorized for seven days after the payment, a delay that
``presents a window for fraud,'' said the auditor's report.
	   Singapore has been spared the rampant corruption that plagues
many of its Asian neighbors, and the country prides itself on
transparent governance.

Eritrean president arrives on two-day visit to Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki
arrived Thursday on a two-day official visit to Malaysia, the first
by a head of the East African nation.
	   Afwerki was received at the airport by Foreign Minister Abdullah
Ahmad Badawi, the national news agency Bernama reported.
	   The official ceremony to welcome the African leader had to be
canceled because the plane bringing him from the Saudi Arabian city
of Riyadh was delayed by more than four hours, a foreign ministry
official said.
	   Afwerki, who is accompanied by Transport and Communications
Minister Salih Kekia and five senior officials, is scheduled to
meet Malaysia's economic planners Thursday. He was scheduled later
to attend a dinner by King Tuanku Ja'afar.

Winds dump volcanic ash on town: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Strong winds have dumped ash over a
town more than 150 kilometers (93 miles) away from an erupting
volcano, a volcanologist said.
	   The Jakarta Post Thursday quoted Ratdomopurbo, an official with
the Volcanology Directorate, as saying ash fell on Gombong, far to
the west of Mount Merapi, which had a spectacular but brief
eruption on Saturday.
	   No injuries or damage were reported and activity within the
2,968-meter (9,737-foot) peak has since subsided.
	   ``It's the first time volcanic ash has fallen on this town,'' he
said.
	   Some villagers living closer to Merapi have been wearing masks
as protection against volcanic dust.
	   Merapi, near Yogyakarta and about 400 kilometers (250 miles)
east of Jakarta, is the most active of Indonesia's 500 volcanoes
and sits in the middle of one of the world's most densely populated
regions.
	   A sudden eruption in 1994 produced a huge steam cloud that
rushed down its slopes and flattened a village, killing 60
inhabitants and severely burning others.
	   Its most destructive eruption this century killed 1,300 people
in 1930.
	   Residents around the mountain were put on an evacuation alert
during the weekend when ash, gas and lava poured from its crater.
But this was downgraded when the mountain calmed.

Now that she has Wimbledon, Novotna wants more majors
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Novotna to play South African Mariaan de Swardt &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ The smile comes quickly to Jana
Novotna's face these days.
	   She jokes about being recognized by fans as she walks down the
street, kids about the ``choke label'' placed on her after near
misses in some majors and blushes about winning this year's
Wimbledon's doubles title with a slight hangover.
	   Nothing seems to bother her, and why should it?
	   Novotna, 29, has been riding the crest of winning the Wimbledon
women's singles title some two weeks ago, her first grand slam
title since turning pro more than 11 years ago.
	   ``Now that I have finally done it, I really feel the relief and
the kind of satisfaction I got out of this, and it's more than I
could ask for,'' Novotna said Wednesday during a news conference
for the A and P Tennis Classic, an exhibition that also features
Steffi Graf.
	   Novotna was to play Anna Kournikova on Thursday, but the Russian
sensation withdrew Wednesday night because she aggravated a thumb
injury received in a mid-June tournament in Eastbourne, England.
	   Novotna will now play South African Mariaan de Swardt.
	   It should not be a tough match for Novotna, who insists her life
has not changed dramatically since beating Nathalie Tauziat in
straight sets for the Wimbledon title.
	   ``I know that it was a big thing for me and I can feel from the
comments from ordinary people watching the match it was a big thing
for them as well,'' said Novotna, who lost two heartbreaking
three-set Wimbledon finals, in 1993 to Graf and in 1997 to Martina
Hingis. ``I'm glad I not only did it for myself, but also everyone
rooting for me and cheering for me.''
	   Novotna and Hingis combined to win the doubles title the
following day, and Novotna said that was as memorable, considering
she celebrated the night before with champagne and other
refreshments.
	   With a blush, Novotna admitted she was still feeling the effects
of the celebration the next day.
	   ``I still did very well,'' she quipped. ``I said maybe this is
working and I should do it more often. I was really enjoying myself
in the doubles. I was really feeling good.''
	   Novotna, who has not lost since the quarterfinals of the French
Open in early June, isn't feeling any pressure to add a couple more
grand slam titles now that she has her first.
	   However, she would not be surprised if she wins a few more,
starting with the U.S. Open in September.
	   ``I think if I can keep going with the same confidence and with
the same enjoyment I have at this moment on the court, it could
easily happen,'' she said. ``If it doesn't happen, my dream just
came true a week ago, and that was the ultimate goal. Anything I
can do afterward is a bonus.''
	   Speaking of bonuses, Novotna said she earned a few monetary ones
winning Wimbledon and she added that her overall value has
increased.
	   A perfect example is this event. Novotna got at least a $100,000
appearance fee late last week to play here. She was to play
Kournikova on Thursday. Korff said Wednesday night he would have to
quickly find an opponent for Novotna.
	   After this event, Novotna said she plans to take a month off and
play in tournaments at Montreal and New Haven, Conn. before the
U.S. Open. During the off time, she'll rest and then work on her
game, which she thinks is good enough to win another major and
maybe even get the No. 1 ranking in women's tennis.
	   It would be another thing to smile about for the new Jana.

Test umpire pleads not guilty to sex charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HOBART, Australia (AP) _ Australia's leading test cricket umpire
Steve Randell pleaded not guilty Thursday to 26 charges of sexual
abuse, 15 more than were originally laid against him.
	   Randell was charged with 11 counts when he first appeared in
Hobart Magistrates Court on May 19. But at a brief hearing
Thursday, Crown Prosecutor Michael Stoddart asked that two
complaints containing 10 charges be withdrawn and others
substituted.
	   The 42-year-old Hobart primary school teacher, who has
officiated in an Australian record 36 tests, spoke only to confirm
his identity. He pleaded not guilty through his solicitor John
Lewinski.
	   Magistrate Sam Mollard remanded him on bail to Sept. 9.
	   The 11 original charges were all of indecent assault in or near
the northwest Tasmanian city of Burnie during 1982 when Randell was
a teacher at a local Catholic primary school. None of the new
charges were read in court.
	   There were 25 charges of indecent assault and one was of sexual
intercourse with a person under the age of 17, on or about May 1,
1979.
	   The most recent was an indecent assault charge in the Hobart
suburb of Moonah between Nov. 1 and Dec. 12, 1995.
	   There were also charges, mainly in the Hobart area, of indecent
assault in 1985, 1986, 1990 and 1994.
	   Randell has been suspended on full pay by the Tasmanian
Education Department and has stood down from umpiring duties until
the charges are dealt with. (djp)

Opposition promises bank services in pre-election sweetener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ In a new round of pre-election
promises to Australia's disaffected rural voters, the Labor
opposition Thursday promised more bank branches in country towns if
it is elected to government.
	   Releasing its rural banking policy ahead of as-yet undeclared
federal elections, Labor said it would make banks invest U.S. dlrs
12 million (Australian dollars 20 million) in a regional services
fund to maintain shrinking services in the Outback.
	   Prime Minister John Howard may call an early election within
months and must do so by May 1999.
	   Howard's conservative coalition defeated Labor at the last
elections in March 1996 in a landslide, but recent opinion polls
suggest Labor has a chance of winning the next election.
	   The coalition is struggling to maintain voter support in country
areas, where farmers and ranchers have been hard hit by
globalization and the government's economic policies.
	   Their anger is reflected in the rise of the right-wing populist
One Nation party, which is polling strongly in regional areas and
drawing most of its support from conservative voters.
	   Labor Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans on Thursday said 102
country communities had lost their last bank branches in the past
three years, while another 201 were relying on single surviving
branches.
	   ``What we have got to do is stop the rot and get the banking
services back to the bush (rural regions),'' Evans said.
	   Under Labor's plan, the Australian Competition and Consumer
Commission would monitor bank fees and charges to ensure country
Australians paid no more than their city cousins for services.
	   Labor would also offer subsidies from the newly established fund
to encourage banks to maintain and restore services to communities
which meet certain population and financial criteria.
	   All licensed banks would have to contribute to the fund, Evans
said.
	   Howard last week announced election sweeteners for rural regions
including cheaper telephone charges and better mobile phone
services.

Anna Kournikova withdraws from exhibition, will miss Federation
</HEADLINE>
Cup &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ Anna Kournikova is going to have to
wait a little longer to return to tennis.
	   The Russian teen-age sensation aggravated a thumb injury
preparing for an exhibition here and will be sidelined several
weeks, forcing her to miss the Federation Cup in Spain next
weekend.
	   Kournikova, 17, injured her right thumb playing at Eastbourne in
mid-June and the injury forced her to skip Wimbledon.
	   Kournikova told officials at the A and P Tennis Classic last
week that she would be able to play in the exhibition. The world's
16th-ranked player was supposed to play Wimbledon champion Jana
Novotna on Thursday night.
	   However, event director John Korff announced late Wednesday that
Kournikova had just withdrawn.
	   ``She told us that she has been practicing and she didn't think
she could play competitively,'' Korff said.
	   Kournikova has been advised by her doctors to rest for several
weeks, forcing her to miss the Fed Cup, Korff said. Mariaan de
Swardt of South Africa, ranked No. 55, agreed to play Novotna on
Thursday night.
	   On the tennis court, Amanda Coetzer broke Lisa Raymond's service
five times in eight chances and posted a 6-1, 6-3 win in the
quarterfinals of the A and P Tennis Classic on Wednesday night.
	   The victory moved the 26-year-old South African into the
semifinals on Saturday, where she will play the winner of the
Novotna-de Swardt match.
	   The other quarterfinals will be played Friday. Steffi Graf will
play Mirjana Lucic in one, while the two finalists in a 32-player
USTA challenger event will play in the other.
	   Coetzer, who is ranked No. 8 in the world, only lost her service
once in the 59-minute match with Raymond, who lost the 1994 final
to Graf.

Flash floods kill 12 in northern Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Flash floods have killed 12 people in
Vietnam's five mountainous northern provinces, the Flood and Storm
Control Department said Thursday.
	   The two recent flash floods wreaked havoc in Yen Bai, Lao Cai,
Quang Ninh, Tuyen Quang and Lai Chau provinces, damaging more than
4,300 houses.
	   Typhoon Linda, which hit last September, and this year's
drought, the country's worst in a century, already have caused
damage of more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   Nguyen Ty Nien, director of the Flood and Storm Control Dept.
told the Communist Party newspaper The People that natural
calamities over the last 26 years have left 12,100 people dead or
missing and destroyed or damaged 9.8 million houses.

Guerrillas kill pro-Israeli militiaman in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas attacked an Israeli-allied
militia position in the occupied zone of south Lebanon Thursday,
killing a militiaman, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas fired rifles and mortars at an outpost of
the South Lebanon Army in the Beaufort Castle area at 5 a.m. local
time (0200 GMT), said the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The outpost is about six kilometers (four miles) northwest of
Marjayoun, the main town in the Israeli-occupied enclave.
	   An Israeli army helicopter flew the militiaman's to Israel, the
officials said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah have been fighting to oust some
1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied militiamen from the
zone that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attack.

Ethnic Vietnamese killed in election violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Three ethnic Vietnamese have been
killed in an attack on a fishing village in what police said
Thursday marked the first murders targeting the minority group
during an election campaign filled with vitriol against them.
	   The Vietnamese and another person were killed Wednesday night
when five unidentified gunmen burst into their home in the eastern
province of Kratie and opened fire with automatic weapons,
officials said. The family had lived in Cambodia since 1980.
	   ``It was a terrorist act, because nothing was stolen after
that,'' said Mao Chandara, a senior Interior Ministry police
official. ``I think it marks the harassment of the Vietnamese
before the elections.''
	   The attackers fled on a boat. An investigation was under way in
order to curb violence in the run-up to voting July 26. Election
authorities had been informed of the attack.
	   An estimated 200,000 to 1 million ethnic Vietnamese live in
Cambodia, a nation of about 10 million people. Many Cambodians
harbor a deep distrust of Vietnam, which has swallowed up large
tracts of Cambodian territory over the centuries.
	   The major opposition candidates in the elections have played up
anti-Vietnamese rhetoric, saying the country risks being overrun by
illegal immigrants and accusing Vietnam of designs on Cambodia.
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen is often accused by his opponents of
being a tool of Vietnam. He came to power during the 1980s, when
the country was under harsh Vietnamese military occupation.
	   Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in 1979 and toppled the
genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, but many Cambodians feared Hanoi
intended to swallow their country.
	   The Khmer Rouge, now all but extinct, survived for years as a
guerrilla army billing itself as Cambodia's defender against
Vietnam. The group massacred scores of ethnic Vietnamese ahead of
U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. Khmer Rouge raiders attacked a
Vietnamese fishing village in April, killing 21 people.

Foreign minister leads race to succeed Hashimoto, young lawmakers

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 2nd graf that contenders meeting other leaders;
party leader vote set for Thursday &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Two senior members of Japan's ruling party moved
Thursday to fill the political void left by outgoing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is to step down before the end of the month
over his party's recent humiliation at the polls.
	   The two politicians _ Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi and former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama _ held a flurry of
closed-door meetings with other party leaders to garner support
ahead of a formal succession vote expected next week.
	   Neither, however, had any public comment.
	   Obuchi was the apparent front-runner in the race, having
reportedly won the support of a large faction within the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party.
	   Obuchi already is a leader of the party's largest faction, run
by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Newspapers reported that
support within the party has largely been built up because of
intense lobbying by Takeshita himself.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally announce his candidacy during
the next two days.
	   Japan's Kyodo News reported that Kajiyama on Thursday had
informed other party leaders of his intentions to run, but his
aides refused to confirm that report.
	   They said an announcement would likely be made soon.
	   The Liberal Democrats had hoped to vote July 21 to choose their
next party president. But in a meeting of all the party's members
of Parliament Thursday, they put that off until July 24 to give the
candidates more time to express their views.
	   The party's leader is virtually assured of becoming prime
minister because of the LDP's majority in Parliament's lower house.
Formal approval of the new prime minister was expected before the
end of the month.
	   Most analysts agree the LDP's weekend defeat in elections for
half the seats in the upper house of Parliament was a stunning
rebuke by voters of how Hashimoto handled Japan's recession-bound
economy.
	   Obuchi has told the public nothing about what he would do to
turn the economy around. Instead, he has followed the Japanese
tradition of trying to win the post through back room consensus
building with other party powerbrokers.
	   That approach has angered younger members of the party, who are
openly calling on the party to stop the clubby politics that they
blame for the party's defeat.
	   Faction politics is exactly what the ruling party must shed if
its to regain the support of the voters, they argue.
	   On Thursday, a former minister of trade and international
industry, Shinji Sato, said he was quitting the Takeshita faction
to protest the manner it had been supporting Obuchi's bid.
	   ``The party only has eyes for factions, not for the people and
their concerns,'' said Shojiro Watanabe, a campaign advisor for
several LDP lawmakers.

UN envoy arrives in Indonesia hoping for E. Timor breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS time element in 1st graf &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A United Nations special envoy arrived
in Indonesia on Thursday, hopeful that political changes in the
Southeast Asian nation will lead to a breakthrough ending more than
two decades of bloodshed in the territory of East Timor.
	   ``This is an opportune time to see what we can do to expedite a
solution,'' said Jamsheed Marker, who has been brokering
negotiations over the future of East Timor, a former Portuguese
colony.
	   ``There is a general will on all sides to arrive at a peaceful
solution, which means consultations of a very intensive kind,'' the
U.N. envoy said.
	   Despite warnings from the government and local authority figures
alike, Marker said he would press ahead with a planned visit to
East Timor within the next few days.
	   The Indonesian government, along with East Timor's Roman
Catholic bishop and Nobel peace prize winner Carlos Belo have
cautioned against such a visit due to fears of violent
demonstrations.
	   During Marker's last visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers
killed two pro-independence protesters.
	   Last month, security forces killed two other activists in East
Timor during protests held to impress three visiting European
ambassadors.
	   Rival groups, either for or against Indonesian rule over the
disputed territory, have clashed repeatedly. Tens of thousands of
people have left East Timor in the past few weeks, fearing that the
violence might escalate.
	   Tensions have also heightened ahead of the 22nd anniversary of
Indonesia's annexation of the territory on Friday.
	   Marker appealed for calm in East Timor, which has endured
guerrilla war and human rights abuses since 1975, when it was
invaded by Indonesia.
	   ``There is a genuine dialogue which is going on now,'' he said.
``This dialogue should be permitted to take place in a calm
atmosphere.''
	   Marker said he planned to meet peace prize winner Belo,
Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, Foreign Minister Ali Alatas and
imprisoned East Timor guerrilla leader Xanana Gusmao.
	   Habibie came to power in May after former President Suharto
quit, ending 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   Suharto ordered the invasion and the 1976 annexation and later
steadfastly refused to make compromises over East Timor.
	   However, Habibie recently offered to release Gusmao and to grant
some autonomy to East Timor in return for international recognition
that it is an integral part of Indonesia.
	   The United Nations and many governments do not recognize
Indonesia's territorial claim.
	   Marker said he hoped to convene a meeting soon between the
foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal along with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan.

Russians pay final tribute to last czar before burial

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of Russians prayed, and
some wept, as they paid final tribute Thursday to Russia's last
czar at a hilltop church in this Ural Mountains city where the
royal family was executed 80 years ago.
	   In a solemn ceremony, the wooden coffins of Nicholas II, his
family and their servants were placed in the Ascension of the Lord
Church in Yekaterinburg before being flown to St. Petersburg, where
they will be buried Friday.
	   With hundreds of police standing guard around the church, people
were allowed in a few at a time to pray and light candles next to
the nine small coffins containing the bones.
	   ``I have come to pay a last tribute to the innocent victims,''
said a tearful Vera Kolchina, 74. ``Their deaths were a tragic part
of our history.''
	   Nicholas and his family were executed by Bolshevik
revolutionaries on July 17, 1918, in the basement of a house that
was just down the hill from the site of Thursday's church service.
	   Their bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
Yekaterinburg and remained there until they were unearthed in 1991.
	   The infamous house where they were shot was torn down in the
1980s under the supervision of the local Communist Party boss at
the time _ Boris Yeltsin.
	   As president, Yeltsin originally sought a grandiose burial
ceremony that would serve as an act of repentance for the sins of
Communism. But it has been scaled back because of disputes among
religious and political leaders, and Yeltsin himself is skipping
the event.
	   Ordinary Russians also have mixed feelings about the czar. Some
saw him as a despot, others consider him a martyr, and there are
those who believe he was simply a weak, indecisive ruler
overwhelmed by the tides of history.
	   ``I have come here because it is a historical event and I wanted
my daughter to see it, so she could tell her children about it,''
said Galina Feoktistova, accompanied by her 10-year-old daughter
Yulia.
	   ``I feel pity for the czar, as for any man who died so
tragically,'' she said. But, she added, ``I don't want the monarchy
restored.''
	   About 1,000 people visited the church during the three-hour
service. Afterward, a thunderstorm broke out just as an honor guard
began removing the coffins from the church to take them to the
airport.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, three of their
five children and four servants.
	   The coffins of the czar and czarina are draped with the yellow
flag of the Romanov family, and the servants' coffins are lined
with silver, rather than the royal gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were executed along with the entire family, but their
remains have not been found and most investigators believe the
bodies were burned to ashes.
	   There has long been a myth that Anastasia survived the shooting
and escaped, but scientific tests indicate that it is her sister
Maria whose bones are missing.
	   Extensive DNA testing in the United States, Britain and Russia
convinced scientists that the remains belonged to the Romanovs. But
the Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept the results, and
top church officials were not be at the services, though local
priests were officiating.
	   Descendants of the Romanov czars laid wreaths Wednesday at a
cemetery in St. Petersburg that contains the remains of many
Russians who died defending the city _ then Leningrad _ during
World War II.
	   It appeared to be part of an effort by the Romanovs to reach out
to the Russian public. Nicholas Romanov, a distant cousin of the
last czar, laid flowers in a ceremony attended by scores of Romanov
descendants.
	   Romanov signed a guest book: ``Nikolai Romanovich Romanov, thank
you from all of us, the Romanovs.''

McDonald's losing out to Muslim dietary laws in Brunei
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei (AP) _ Big Macs have been scratched
from McDonald's menus in Brunei until the burgers are deemed kosher
by Muslim religious officials.
	   The Ministry of Religious Affairs has halted importation of beef
and chicken at the two McDonald's in the Southeast Asian kingdom,
worried the foreign meat was not ``halal,'' or kosher, under Muslim
law.
	   The oil-rich sultanate, whose people are 70 percent Muslim,
imports most food from other countries. McDonald's processing
plants in Malaysia supply beef and chicken to the Brunei chains.
Although Malaysian plants adhere to local Muslim dietary laws,
those laws are not recognized in neighboring Brunei.
	   The ministry began a review last month of food products used by
restaurants around the capital, Badar Seri Begawan, checking that
halal standards were met. The McDonald's review is not expected
until August or September, said a company official.
	   ``We'll have to wait, just keep waiting for an answer,'' said
Rosli Metassan, assistant manager for Golden Arches Sdn. Bhd.,
which runs the Brunei-Malaysia franchise of the U.S. hamburger
giant McDonald's Corp.
	   In the meantime, sales have dropped by half at Brunei
McDonald's, where an inhospitable greeting is taped to the picture
windows: ``Due to unforeseen circumstances, we will not be able to
sell any of the following items until further notice.'' The items
listed were Burgers, Big Macs and Chicken McNuggets.
	   Marketing strategies to plug McEgg and Filet-o-Fish sandwiches
have failed to boost business, said Rosli.
	   As Jana Idris, 27, a former regular who works at a nearby hotel,
put it, ``Who wants to go to McDonald's for a fish burger?''

Fewer airline passengers to Australia as Asian crisis hits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ The number of international airline
passengers going to and from Australia took a sharp tumble in
February as the Asian economic crisis worsened, figures released
Thursday showed.
	   Passenger numbers had climbed continuously since June 1991 but
the rise was stopped in December 1997, when passenger numbers
dropped 2.2 percent, according to Department of Transport
statistics.
	   That was followed by a slight rise of 0.1 percent in January
this year, during the traditional vacation period, but numbers
plummeted again.
	   Passenger numbers fell by 3.2 percent in February compared to
the same month in 1997, the statistics show.
	   On an annual basis, the number of international passengers
arriving and departing Australia increased 4.5 percent in the 12
months to February 1998, less than half the 9.5 percent growth rate
in the same period 12 months earlier.
	   In February, 570,234 people flew into Australia, down by 25,500
from February 1997, and 515,646 people flew out, down almost 11,000
from the previous period, according to the department.
	   Figures are expected to get worse, as the impact of service
cutbacks on airlines is felt.
	   Australian airlines Qantas Airways Ltd. and Ansett Airlines
stopped services to South Korea earlier this year and scaled back
other Southeast Asian flights, with Ansett also dropping out of
Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur.
	   Traffic between Sydney and the New Zealand city of Auckland was
the busiest route, despite a drop in passenger numbers of 6.4
percent.

An apologetic Albert rehired as sportscaster with MSG
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID BAUDER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Television Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ An apologetic Marv Albert will get his second
chance at the same place he got his first.
	   A broadcasting career that took Albert to the top of his
profession before unraveling in an embarrassing sex scandal 10
months ago began when he called New York Knicks and Rangers games
on the radio in the 1960s.
	   On Wednesday, the MSG Network said it would rehire Albert to do
radio play-by-play of Knicks games and anchor a nightly sports show
on television.
	   ``We consider Marv part of the family and loyalty is important
to us,'' said Dave Checketts, president and CEO of Madison Square
Garden.
	   It was a far more contrite Albert who sat before a microphone at
a news conference, saying he was a changed man because of time off
and 10 months of therapy.
	   Albert resigned from MSG in September and was fired by NBC after
pleading guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge. He was accused of
throwing his former girlfriend, Vanessa Perhach, on a bed in a
Virginia hotel room in February 1997, biting her on the back more
than a dozen times and forcing her to perform oral sex.
	   After stopping his lurid trial in September to plead guilty to
assault and battery, Albert was spared jail time if he stayed out
of trouble for a year.
	   Albert began his news conference on Wednesday by apologizing for
his conduct, the very thing his critics said he didn't really do in
a round of interviews last November.
	   ``What I did was wrong,'' he said. ``I hurt many people,
including my fiancee, my family, my friends and my employers. For
that, I am sorry.''
	   He said he'd take his comeback ``one step at a time'' and
wouldn't say whether he would try to get back into network sports.
He was NBC's lead NBA announcer before being fired, and also called
NFL games.
	   Albert said he would continue his therapy and wouldn't be so
work-obsessed, which got him in trouble in the first place. ``My
lifestyle and my hectic schedule did not allow me to call a
timeout,'' he said.
	   He'll call about half the Knicks games on the radio, mostly home
games. He will also anchor ``MSG Sports Desk,'' a half-hour rundown
on New York City sports, beginning Sept. 14. That job harkens back
to his days as sports anchor on WNBC-TV in New York from 1975 to
1987.
	   Although Checketts called Albert family, he said bringing him
back was also a business decision. He checked with MSG sponsors and
shareholders to see what objections they would have, and even spoke
to Albert's therapist about whether he was ready.
	   ``I think we're going to get tremendous support,'' Checketts
said. ``I think people are going to rally around him. How long do
we have to hold some people out ... and punish them? It's not our
right. He's ready to come back.''

Astros reliever hit in head by line drive
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ In a frightening and all-too-familiar scene,
Houston reliever Billy Wagner was hit in the head by a line drive
and taken off the field on a stretcher in the bottom of the ninth
inning Wednesday night in the Astros' 9-8 loss in 11 innings to
Arizona.
	   Wagner never lost consciousness and his vital signs were OK when
he left the ballpark, Diamondbacks doctors said. Wagner was taken
to a neurological center for further tests.
	   Wagner barely had time to react to Kelly Stinnett's liner,
raising his glove too late to stop the ball from knocking him flat.
The ball caromed on the fly nearly to the third-base dugout as
Wagner sprawled on the mound, lying on his back and his legs
flopping.
	   The 26-year-old left-hander was talking to the trainers that
rushed to him. More than a dozen players on both teams, along with
an umpire, watched over Wagner as the crowd of 42,229 quieted at
the Bank One Ballpark.
	   A medical team immobilized Wagner's head and placed him on a
stretcher before driving him off the field on a cart. The bruise on
the left side of Wagner's head had already swelled.
	   Arizona's Matt Williams, who had moved from first to second on
Stinnett's single, was among the first players to reach Wagner. The
game was delayed about 15 minutes while Wagner was treated and
reliever Jay Powell warmed up.
	   Wagner is Houston's closer, and was trying for his second save
in two days and 23rd of the season.
	   The accident was reminiscent of two scary incidents in the past
two seasons.
	   Earlier this year, Baltimore pitcher Mike Mussina had his nose
broken and face bloodied by a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's
Sandy Alomar.
	   Last year, Arizona's Willie Blair _ then with Detroit _ had his
jaw broken when struck by a smash from Cleveland's Julio Franco.
The liner was clocked at 107 mph (171 kph).
	   Blair was injured nearly 40 years to the day after former
Indians pitcher Herb Score was hit in the eye by a line drive off
the bat of Gil McDougald of the New York Yankees on May 7, 1957, at
Cleveland. Score pitched five more years in the majors but was
never the same.

Japanese stocks rise for fourth day, dollar higher in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, midafternoon bond and currency
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks rose for the fourth straight day
Thursday, lifted by reports that a senior politician known for
promoting banking reform wants to succeed outgoing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto. The dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 117.78 points,
or 0.71 percent, and closed at 16,731.92 after having lost more
than 100 points in early trading. It had gained 125.23 points, or
0.76 percent, Wednesday.
	   Investors warmed to a Kyodo News report Thursday afternoon that
former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama has privately
expressed his desire to seek the premiership, traders said.
	   Kajiyama, a senior figure in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
and an outspoken critic of the Hashimoto administration, has won
plaudits from investors by calling for bold steps to stabilize
Japan's bad loan-plagued banking industry.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section climbed 5.42 points, or 0.42 percent, closing at
1,280.73. It had gained 8.66 points, or 0.68 percent, the previous
day.
	   On Monday, Hashimoto announced his intention to resign following
the Liberal Democrats' trouncing in elections for the upper house
of Parliament. The LDP still controls the government, however,
because of its majority in the more powerful lower house.
	   Leading contenders to fill the sudden vacuum at the top include
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, head of the Liberal Democrats'
largest faction, and Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
	   The LDP plans to choose Hashimoto's replacement next week, and
Parliament was expected to vote a new prime minister into office by
month's end.
	   Word of Kajiyama's likely bid to succeed Hashimoto also sent the
dollar lower against the yen. On the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
the dollar bought 140.00 yen in midafternoon, down 0.66 yen from
late Wednesday and also below its level of 140.50 yen overnight in
New York.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.425 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.405 percent, driving its price down to 110.23 yen from 110.38
yen.

Guerrillas kill pro-Israeli militiaman in southern Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Guerrillas attacked an Israeli-allied
militia position in the occupied zone of south Lebanon Thursday,
killing a militiaman, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Hezbollah guerrillas fired rifles and mortars at an outpost of
the South Lebanon Army in the Beaufort Castle area at 5 a.m. local
time (0200 GMT), said the officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   The outpost is about six kilometers (four miles) northwest of
Marjayoun, the main town in the Israeli-occupied enclave.
	   An Israeli army helicopter flew the militiaman's body to Israel,
the officials said.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been fighting to oust some
1,500 Israeli soldiers and their 2,500 allied SLA militiamen from
the zone that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern
territory from guerrilla attack.

Thai doctors condemn man trying to sell kidney in newspaper
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai doctors condemned a newspaper
story Thursday in which a merchant offered to sell one of his
kidneys to pay off his mortgage.
	   In a front-page story in Thursday's Matichon, a Thai-language
business daily, Sanchai Thongpaijit, 65, announced he would sell
one of his kidneys to the highest bidder.
	   The shopkeeper, who said his family can't afford to repay a
600,000 baht (dlrs 14,285) housing loan since his son lost his job,
hopes to get a minimum of 1 million baht (dlrs 23,800).
	   ``It is necessary,'' Sanchai told The Associated Press. ``If I
sell one side of my kidneys, my family will no longer have
financial worries.''
	   The Thai Transplant Society criticized Sanchai and the paper,
saying that selling one's kidney violates medical ethics and is
illegal.
	   ``I don't think it is possible to do so,'' said Dr. Kittichai
Luengtaviboon of the Thai Transplantation Society. ``It is immoral
and criminal according to the universal standard.''
	   He said organs can only be donated, and that the maximum age
range for donors should be 50 to 60.
	   ``This just shows how poor people have become,'' Kittichai said.
	   Unless police intervene, however, Sanchai will probably find a
buyer, and one who will pay more than his minimum asking price.
	   According to Dr. Phaibul Jitpraphai, about 2,500 patients in
Thailand need kidney transplants, and only about 250 kidneys become
available each year
	   Consequently, a black market has emerged, with kidneys selling
for a minimum of 2.5 million baht (dlrs 60,000).
	   Dozens of Thais travel to China each year to receive kidneys
that doctors at the society say come from executed prisoners.
	   They say the transplants in China are exceedingly risky, with at
least 40 percent of patients contracting hepatitis, HIV, or other
infections.
	   Some have died on the operating table.
	   ``I beg them not to go to China,'' Phaibul said. ``But then they
ask me, `Can you get me a kidney?' And I can't say yes.''

Families weep at reunions from first direct U.S. flight to Cuba in

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ Some called out the names of relatives they had
not seen in decades. Others wept as they fell into the arms of
their returning family members.
	   The Havana airport was full of heart-tugging moments Wednesday
as more than 200 people arrived aboard the first direct commercial
flight from the United States to Cuba in two years.
	   For Gladys Cardentey, a 62-year-old now living in Boston,
Wednesday brought the first glimpse of her 18-month-old
granddaughter and namesake. At her sister's small but bustling
Havana apartment, Cardentey beamed as her daughter bounced the
child on her knee.
	   ``I see the new faces of my family,'' the grandmother said. ``I
feel good.''
	   Most of the others who made the trip from Miami visited
relatives they hadn't seen for years _ even decades. One of those
was Cardentey's 9-year-old grandson Joslyn Alvarez Dominguez, who
after 3 1/2 years in the United States had to ask whether the tall,
nervous man standing at the airport gate waiting to greet him was
his father.
	   He was, and Joslyn attempted a hug over the fence separating
them.
	   Hundreds of waving and screaming Cubans crowded in and around
Jose Marti International Airport when the chartered Boeing 767-300
rented from United Airlines landed from its 45-minute flight from
Miami International Airport.
	   President Bill Clinton canceled direct flights in 1996 to punish
Fidel Castro's government for shooting down two unarmed civilian
aircraft.
	   Those planes carried members of the anti-Castro exile group
Brothers to the Rescue who were searching for refugees over
international waters when Cuban military jets shot them out of the
sky, killing four people.
	   Cuba maintains that the planes were shot down after violating
Cuban airspace. But a U.N. panel ruled in 1996 that the planes were
shot down over international waters and that Cuba violated
international law.
	   Clinton lifted the ban on direct flights in March, two months
after Pope John Paul II visited Cuba. At the time, Clinton said the
resumption of flights and other measures were designed to build on
the pope's trip and ``help prepare the Cuban people for a
democratic transition.''
	   The U.S. trade embargo against Cuba remains in place. But the
Treasury Department, which administers it, has granted approvals to
nine companies to resume direct flights.
	   Miami's Airline Brokers Co. _ also known as ABC Charters _ made
the first trip. Seven small charter companies were also approved,
along with American Airlines.
	   During the past two years, flights to Cuba had to stop in the
Bahamas or Mexico, increasing travel time to three hours or more.
The indirect routes also bumped up ticket prices by more than dlrs
100.
	   The passengers on Wednesday's flight each paid dlrs 399 for a
round-trip ticket, more expensive than direct flights used to be.
With the resumption of nonstop flights, travel agents say ticket
prices likely will inch downward again.
	   Wednesday's passengers brought luggage filled with clothes,
vitamins and basic medicines. Cardentey said she and her daughter
also brought powdered milk _ one of many items that are difficult
to obtain in Cuba.
	   ``We brought all we could bring,'' she said at the family
reunion.
	   Across the room, her 31-year-old daughter, Daisy Dominguez,
chatted with a lifelong friend about working at a supermarket in
Hollywood, Florida.
	   ``We have to work at night,'' she told her.
	   ``Here,'' replied Marlene Gallardo, ``the market is only open in
the daytime.''
	   The simple, easy conversation began to knit the far-flung family
back together.
	   ``We're all healthy,'' Cardentey said. But most importantly,
``I'm with my family.''

	   Leading contenders to fill the sudden vacuum at the top include
Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, head of the Liberal Democrats'
largest faction, and Health Minister Junichiro Koizumi.
	   The LDP plans to choose Hashimoto's replacement next week, and
Parliament was expected to vote a new prime minister into office by
month's end.
	   Word of Kajiyama's likely bid to succeed Hashimoto also sent the
dollar lower against the yen. On the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
the dollar bought 140.00 yen in midafternoon, down 0.66 yen from
late Wednesday and also below its level of 140.50 yen overnight in
New York.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.425 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.405 percent, driving its price down to 110.23 yen from 110.38
yen.

Russians pay final tribute to last czar before burial

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of Russians prayed, and
some wept, as they paid final tribute Thursday to Russia's last
czar at a hilltop church in this Ural Mountains city where the
royal family was executed 80 years ago.
	   In a solemn ceremony, the wooden coffins of Nicholas II, his
family and their servants were placed in the Ascension of the Lord
Church in Yekaterinburg before being flown to St. Petersburg, where
they will be buried Friday.
	   And in a surprise development, President Boris Yeltsin has
changed his mind and decided to attend Friday's service, Russian
news agencies reported, citing the presidential press service.
	   Yeltsin's office had said previously that the president who not
be present because of the controversies among political and
religious leaders over how to handle the burial.
	   In Yekaterinburg, hundreds of police stood guard around the
church, and people were allowed in a few at a time to pray and
light candles next to the nine small coffins containing the bones.
	   ``I have come to pay a last tribute to the innocent victims,''
said a tearful Vera Kolchina, 74. ``Their deaths were a tragic part
of our history.''
	   Nicholas and his family were executed by Bolshevik
revolutionaries on July 17, 1918, in the basement of a house that
was just down the hill from the site of Thursday's church service.
	   Their bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
Yekaterinburg and remained there until they were unearthed in 1991.
	   The infamous house where they were shot was torn down in the
1980s under the supervision of the local Communist Party boss at
the time _ Yeltsin.
	   As president, Yeltsin originally sought a grandiose burial
ceremony that would serve as an act of repentance for the sins of
Communism. But it has been scaled back because of a series of
disputes.
	   Ordinary Russians also have mixed feelings about the czar. Some
saw him as a despot, others consider him a martyr, and there are
those who believe he was simply a weak, indecisive ruler
overwhelmed by the tides of history.
	   ``I have come here because it is a historical event and I wanted
my daughter to see it, so she could tell her children about it,''
said Galina Feoktistova, accompanied by her 10-year-old daughter
Yulia.
	   ``I feel pity for the czar, as for any man who died so
tragically,'' she said. But, she added, ``I don't want the monarchy
restored.''
	   About 1,000 people visited the church during the three-hour
service. Afterward, a thunderstorm broke out just as an honor guard
began removing the coffins from the church to take them to the
airport.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, three of their
five children and four servants.
	   The coffins of the czar and czarina are draped with the yellow
flag of the Romanov family, and the servants' coffins are lined
with silver, rather than the royal gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were executed along with the entire family, but their
remains have not been found and most investigators believe the
bodies were burned to ashes.
	   There has long been a myth that one of the daughters, Anastasia,
survived the shooting and escaped. But scientific tests indicate
her bones are among the remains and those of her sister Maria are
missing.
	   Extensive DNA testing in the United States, Britain and Russia
convinced scientists of the authenticity of the remains. But the
Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept the results, and top
church officials were not be at the services, though local priests
were officiating.

Sorenstam still around
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, New York (AP) _ Annika Sorenstam has dominated the
LPGA tour for three years, twice being named player of the year and
finishing in the top three on the money list each year, including
1997's record-setting dlrs 1.2 million.
	   Yet on Wednesday, she was answering questions about changes she
has made to her game, time she has taken off and the new kid on the
block _ Se Ri Pak.
	   ``Last year was incredible and it's very difficult coming off a
hot year,'' she said the day before the start of the JAL Big Apple
Classic at Wykagyl Country Club. ``The expectations are so high and
you're always wondering `Where can I go from here.'''
	   Sorenstam won six times last season in setting the money record,
and it's not like she dropped off the charts in 1998. She has two
wins this year _ the Michelob Light Classic and the ShopRite LPGA
Classic _ and is fourth on the money list with dlrs 545,474.
	   Those numbers, however, are one win and about dlrs 100,000 shy
of Pak, who has won two majors and is on a two-week winning streak,
all as a rookie.
	   ``It's always impressive for a rookie to win a tournament, let
alone majors,'' said Sorenstam, who at 28 is eight years older than
Pak. ``She has shown she can play all types of golf courses. She
has acheived some incredible things. It's nice to see and it brings
focus to our tour.''
	   Sorenstam's rivalry with Karrie Webb dominated the tour the last
two years. Now it's Pak and her chase of records that's drawing the
attention, and it doesn't seem to bother Sorenstam in the least.
	   ``I took last week off and it came at the perfect time because I
needed it,'' she said of the week following the U.S. Open, which
was won by Pak in a 20-hole playoff. Pak then set LPGA records for
a round (61) and total score (23-under 261) in the Jamie Farr
Kroger Classic. ``The Open was a hectic week. Now I'm rested and
ready to play. I feel comfortable, confident.''
	   Sorenstam, who said she spent the time off just enjoying things
besides golf, said she had changed her putter for a while.
	   ``I'm back to the old putter and the old grip,'' she said. ``I'm
back to the basics where I know it works.''
	   Pak is trying to become the first LPGA player to win three
straight tournaments since JoAnne Carner in 1982. That would leave
her two wins shy of Nancy Lopez's record of five set in her amazing
rookie season in 1978.
	   Lopez said Pak's recent run has had her thinking a lot of her
great start 20 years ago. It just has Sorenstam impressed.
	   ``I've never won three in a row,'' she said. ``It's more of a
mental thing because the courses are all so different. Winning
three in a season is hard.''

Relieved Indonesia welcomes IMF decision to restart lending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARIS SYAMAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A relieved Indonesia on Thursday
welcomed an International Monetary Fund decision to restart lending
to it, saying the release of a dlrs 1 billion installment would
bring some relief to its battered economy.
	   Indonesia's top economic minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, said
the decision would boost the value of the sagging rupiah against
the U.S. dollar and provide badly needed foreign exchange reserves.
	   The IMF approved the release of the money in Washington
Wednesday as part of a dlrs 43 billion rescue plan.
	   It also agreed to a dlrs 1.3 billion increase in an existing
standby credit facility to Indonesia, and announced that more than
dlrs 6 billion from various official sources would be available by
the end of March 1999.
	   Indonesia's economy is suffering its worst crisis in 30 years.
It has been the hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   The IMF and Indonesian officials agreed on a bailout program
last year. However, the plan stalled several times when the IMF
complained that then-President Suharto was not living up to
promises to reform the economy.
	   The dlrs 1 billion payment was postponed in May when political
turmoil, riots and protests forced Suharto to quit after 32 years
in power.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, restarted negotiations
with the IMF and is following through with tough reforms.
	   Meanwhile, Ginandjar said Indonesia has agreed in principle with
some of its international lenders to reschedule its sovereign debt
_ a course the world's fourth most populous nation had tried to
avoid until now.
	   Speaking after a meeting with Habibie, he said the government is
working on the details with lenders and would reach final agreement
with donors at the Consultative Group on Indonesia meeting in Paris
July 19-30.
	   Ginandjar said the government still has to agree with its
biggest lender, Japan, on rescheduling debt.
	   ``Japan insists on repayment of principal loans first before it
can talk about rescheduling,'' Ginandjar said.
	   Ginandjar said the government would continue to pay interest on
its debt.
	   Indonesian government debt stood at dlrs 54.4 billion on March
31, the latest date for which figures are available.
	   Public sector debt, which groups government and state-owned
enterprises' debt, stood at dlrs 65.56 billion.

Gunmen kill Sunni Muslim leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen shot and killed a Sunni Muslim
leader Thursday in a congested old quarter of this southern port
city, police officials said.
	   Paramilitary officers and scores of policemen were deployed in
the area to prevent retaliatory protests. Shops quickly shuttered
and people stayed indoors following the shooting.
	   No one took responsibility for the killing of Saleem Raza, who
was shot by three gunmen as he stepped out of his home.
	   Raza was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died, said
hospital officials.
	   Hundreds of mourners gathered at the hospital wailing and
demanding that the culprits be captured.
	   A teeming city of 14 million people, Karachi has been wracked in
recent months by relentless violence between rival factions of an
ethnic militant party.
	   While Karachi has been the scene of religiously motivated
killings, the shooting death of Raza was the first in several
months.
	   Most often police blame members of militant Shiite Muslim groups
for the killing of followers of the Sunni sect of Islam, which is
in the majority in Islamic Pakistan.
	   Police said they were investigating the shooting.

Thai finance companies suffered massive losses in 1997: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's finance and securities
companies lost nearly 55 billion baht (dlrs 1.3 billion) in 1997,
according to a report released Thursday by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
	   In 1996, the industry compiled profits of 13.8 billion (dlrs 552
million, at that year's exchange rate).
	   The stunning turnaround came after Thailand floated its
currency, the baht, on July 2, 1997, and it promptly lost between
40 and 50 percent of its value.
	   That proved disastrous for many of the country's 93 finance
companies, which found they were unable to recover loans, mainly
from real estate developers who had large amounts of unhedged
foreign currency debt and were going bankrupt.
	   In addition, many of the finance companies had their own foreign
currency loans, which became more costly to repay as the baht fell.
	   The government was forced to shut down and liquidate the assets
of 54 of the finance companies that had become insolvent.
	   The SEC report attributed the sector's losses to declining loan
revenues and asset quality, higher funding costs and
foreign-exchange losses.

Malaysian prices rises
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's consumer price index
rose 6.2 percent in June from its year earlier level, compared with
a 5.4 percent increase in May, the national news agency Bernama
reported Thursday.
	   For the year's first six months, inflation amounted to 5.0
percent from January-June last year.
	   The inflation rate is getting closer to the government's latest
forecast of 7 to 8 percent this year. However, independent
economists suggest the inflation rate could reach double digits by
the end of the year.
	   Checking inflation is one of the major challenges facing
Malaysia as it slips into recession. Higher prices could further
aggravate the woes of citizens who have lost jobs or suffered
reduced earnings in the last year.

Novartis announces half-yearly sales rise of 1 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis
said Thursday its first-half 1998 sales rose by one percent on the
same period the previous year.
	   Sales for the first six months rose to 16.77 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 11.5 billion) from 16.52 billion francs (dlrs 11.3
billion) last year, the company said in a statement.
	   In March, Novartis announced a 43 percent rise in its net profit
for 1997, the first full year since it was created by the merger of
Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG.
	   The group said its first-half pharmaceutical sales were 3
percent higher than in 1997, although it didn't specify the amount.
	   Over the full year, Novartis expects ``a marked increase in net
income to new record levels.'' It called 1998 ``a transition year
marked by a shift from integration to a focus on growth and product
launches.''
	   Novartis will present its first-half 1998 earnings report at the
end of August, the company announced.

World Bank officials meet with Myanmar military government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Two officials of the World Bank are
visiting Myanmar and have met with the country's senior economic
minister, the state-run New Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
	   The paper said the bank's executive director, Jannes Hutagalung,
and senior adviser, Bradley Babson, held discussions with Gen.
David Abel.
	   Abel, formerly minister of national planning and economic
development, is now minister of the office of the chairman of the
military government. He is considered the most capable member of
the government in the field of economics.
	   They discussed relations between the bank and Myanmar, the
effect of Asia's economic crisis on the country and reforms for
economic progress in Myanmar.
	   Myanmar's economy is struggling despite the government's
attempts to attract foreign investment. Its currency, the kyat, has
lost more than 60 percent of its value and inflation is running at
more than 50 percent.
	   In addition, the United States imposed economic sanctions on
Myanmar in April 1997 because of the military government's
increased repression against the country's democracy movement and
because of its alleged failure to fight drug growing and smuggling.
	   The World Bank currently gives no assistance to Myanmar. The
bank closed its lending window to Myanmar after the military
government violently suppressed a democracy uprising in 1988 and
then refused to recognize the results of a national election in
1990, which it lost by a landslide.
	   The bank has also urged Myanmar to undertake a wide range of
economic reforms, including revaluing the exchange rate of the
kyat, but the Myanmar government has not complied to the degree
bank officials deem necessary.

Newspaper reports Mandela to wed Graca Machel on Saturday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela will
wed Graca Machel on Saturday, his 80th birthday, in a private
ceremony at his home in a Johannesburg suburb, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   Presidential spokeswoman Priscilla Naidoo said the president's
office ``was not aware'' of any plan for Mandela to marry his Mrs.
Machel, the widow of Mozambican President Samora Machel.
	   Presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana, in comments to the
South African Press Association, denied the report. ``It is not
true,'' he said.
	   The Star, citing unidentified sources in Cape Town and
Johannesburg, said the ceremony would take place Saturday and that
the Department of Home Affairs had been asked to arrange the
formalities because Mrs. Machel is a Mozambican citizen.
	   The newspaper said Johannesburg chief magistrate Charlton Bashe
had apparently been asked to officiate at the ceremony. The Star
said Mandela was expected to announce the wedding at a banquet
Sunday night in honor of his 80th birthday.
	   Mandela and Mrs. Machel went public with their relationship last
year.
	   Mrs. Machel, one of the most influential people in Mozambique,
is a lawyer and international campaigner for children's rights. The
couple met in 1990, shortly after Mandela was released from prison.
	   For some time, Mandela has insisted that she be treated as a
first-lady during foreign state visits.
	   They previously denied rumors they planned to wed, even after
Archbishop Desmond Tutu publicly but light-heartedly chastised
them, saying they were setting a bad example for young people.
	   The president has earlier declared his willingness to marry, but
indicated that the reluctance came from Mrs. Machel.
	   She has admitted her reluctance in previous interviews, but did
not preclude the possibility.
	   If they wed Saturday, it would be the third marriage for
Mandela. His married his first wife, Evelyn, in 1944, and divorced
her in 1957 after quarrels over his long nights of political
involvement. He had four children from his first marriage, however,
two of them died.
	   Mandela's second marriage to Winnie Madikizela-Mandela in 1958
survived his 27 years in prison but ended in divorce in 1996. They
had two daughters before Mandela was sent to prison.

Reinsdorf says he doesn't know Jordan's plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes from Reinsdorf on Jordan's status &QL; 
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Jerry Reinsdorf is confident the Chicago Bulls
will hire a coach who can work with Michael Jordan. The team's
chairman still isn't sure if the game's greatest player will retire
or return.
	   ``Michael has to make a decision based on who the coach is and
what his own personal desires are,'' Reinsdorf said in an ESPN
interview Wednesday.
	   ``He indicated earlier that he was going to take all summer
really to decide whether he wanted to play. I think he deserves the
right to take as long as he wants to decide what he wants to do
with his future.
	   ``I don't know if he wants to come back. I don't know if he is
going to come back. I do know Michael is still the best player in
the NBA. What I said at the trophy presentation is that I hope
Michael, Scottie Pippen and the rest of the players will come back
and defend the championship.''
	   Jordan was playing in a pro-am golf event Thursday in the
Ameritech Senior Open in suburban Long Grove, Illinois, and
scheduled a news conference for late in the afternoon after his
round, perhaps to discuss his future.
	   Since the Bulls clinched their sixth title in June, Jordan has
made just one public comment. That came at a North Carolina golf
tournament last month when he said he still hadn't made up his
mind, but wanted no part of a rebuilding process.
	   Reinsdorf said he talked with Jordan about possible candidates
to replace Phil Jackson, reiterating that the five-time MVP doesn't
have veto power over the selection.
	   The leading candidate, according to most reports, is Iowa State
coach Tim Floyd, whom Jordan derisively referred to as ``Pink''
during the season. Floyd, long rumored to be Jackson's successor,
is a fishing buddy of Bulls general manager Jerry Krause.
	   In addition to Floyd, NBA assistants Paul Silas (Charlotte),
Scott Skiles (Phoenix), Rick Carlisle (Indiana) and Ron Rothstein
(Cleveland) have interviewed.
	   ``I had a nice conversation with Michael before July 1. Since
then, of course, because of the lockout I'm not allowed to talk to
him,'' Reinsdorf said.
	   ``But I think I have a pretty good feel at this point. Under the
rules, when we do reach a decision, I'm just simply not allowed to
talk to Michael.''
	   After the Bulls won their sixth title in eight years, Jackson
declined an offer to return. Jordan maintained throughout the
season he wouldn't play for a coach other than Jackson, but
softened his stance.
	   ``We're not going to get a coach who would have a difficult time
coaching Michael Jordan, but Michael's not the kind of guy who
wants to run a franchise. He doesn't want to select a coach. He
doesn't want to veto any coaches. So I don't think that's a big
issue,'' Reinsdorf said.
	   ``I mentioned some names of possible candidates to Michael.
Michael would never want to tell me who the coach should be or who
the coach should not be. That's not Michael Jordan.
	   ``I think I understand Michael. I would be foolish to hire
somebody without feeling confident that this is somebody that
Michael could play for.''
	   Reinsdorf said the Bulls could name their new coach within a
week or so. He said the process was complicated because with nine
free agents, the team doesn't know who will be back and who won't.

East Timor governor warns against violent demonstrations

	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timor's governor called for calm
Thursday and said the military would take ``stern action'' if
pro-independence demonstrations turned violent during celebrations
to mark the disputed territory's annexation by Indonesia 22 years
ago.
	   Gov. Abilio Soares issued the warning as troops patrolled the
streets of Dili and stopped cars and passers-by, checking
identification papers ahead of Friday's anniversary.
	   Anti-Indonesian activists said they would hold only a small
protest within the walled grounds of Dili's Roman Catholic
cathedral on Friday.
	   ``We oppose the celebrations. But we don't want any violence,''
said student activist Antonio da Silva.
	   Workers put up Indonesian red and white bunting around the
town's main government building, where a flag-raising ceremony is
to be held.
	   Indonesian flags were also flying in some nearby villages.
	   Indonesia invaded the former Portuguese colony in 1975 and
formally declared it as its 27th province on July 17, 1976.
	   Since then the half-island territory has endured a guerrilla
war, human rights abuses and regular protests.
	   In recent days, many settlers from other parts of Indonesia have
reportedly fled East Timor, fearing that they would be targeted if
violence erupted.
	   Some reports said more than 20,000 had fled.
	   The military has said more than 7,000 have left. But Soares put
the figure at 4,000, saying that other figures were exaggerated.
	   The newspaper Jakarta Post reported that one town on the land
border with West Timor had set up a temporary camp to house and
feed 10,000 people. However, it has not been used.
	   In Jakarta, Jamsheed Marker, the United Nations' special envoy
for East Timor, arrived, saying he intended to go ahead with a trip
to the disputed territory within the next few days.
	   This is despite fears by the Indonesian government and East
Timor's Bishop Carlos Belo that Marker's presence might result in
big protests that could turn violent.
	   During Marker's last visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers
killed two pro-independence protesters.
	   Last month, security forces killed another two activists in East
Timor during protests held to impress three visiting European
ambassadors.
	   Rival groups, for or against Indonesian rule, have clashed
repeatedly.

After stirring up storm over Dutch drug policy, U.S. drug czar
</HEADLINE>
visits Amsterdam &QL;

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ U.S. drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey
flew into the eye of a self-made storm Thursday as he arrived for a
day-long visit to study the permissive Dutch narcotics policy he
has already branded an ``unmitigated disaster.''
	   His harsh criticism of the Dutch policy prompted officials here
to question the value of his mission that has become a showdown of
sorts between America's zero-tolerance approach to drugs and the
laissez-faire Dutch policy.
	   From the corridors of Dutch government buildings where
retaliatory statements were issued, to funky coffee shops where
hashish and marijuana are sold over the counter, the retired
four-star general has generated a buzz.
	   ``It's easy to point the finger at others when you have a
problem at home,'' said Anouke Scholten at Amsterdam's Coffeeshop
36, referring to U.S. officials' long-fought battle against
narcotics.
	   ``He (McCaffrey) has to come to our coffee shop and look around.
The atmosphere is good and there is no violence,'' added Scholten.
	   But there's no chance of that happening.
	   After arriving in Amsterdam, McCaffrey was hurled into a packed
day of activities, ranging from presentations on the Netherlands'
latest state-funded heroin handout experiment to techniques used by
customs authorities in the world's largest port, Rotterdam, to
intercept international drug shipments.
	   McCaffrey was to see just about every aspect of the Dutch policy
at work, except a coffee shop _ the officially-tolerated cafes that
sell hashish and marijuana.
	   Although still technically illegal, the sale and consumption of
small amounts of soft drugs like hashish and marijuana are
tolerated by Dutch authorities. Hard drugs like cocaine and heroin
also are cheap and easily available. Law enforcement agencies claim
it is better to spend money on trying to battle international drug
smuggling than street-level trade.
	   Dutch officials fear McCaffrey has arrived burdened with
preconceived ideas and will learn nothing from his visit.
	   As well as the ``unmitigated disaster'' description, McCaffrey
this week claimed that the Dutch murder rate is twice as high as
that in the United States due to the tolerant Dutch drug policy.
	   The Dutch angrily publicized statistics refuting McCaffrey's
claims and stood by their often-criticized policy.
	   ``We have our own policy and we think it works,'' said Health
Ministry spokesman Benno Bruggink. ``We don't tell people that it
is the one and only solution.''
	   The criticism is not new to the Dutch. Besides the United
States, the country also has been under fire from other European
countries, most often France, which claims its nationals flock into
the Netherlands to stock up on cheap drugs.
	   Although advocates of more liberal drug laws in the United
States claim the Dutch model is a shining example of the way states
should tackle narcotics, most Dutch experts disagree.
	   Professor Wim van den Brink, who was meeting with McCaffrey to
discuss addiction treatment programs in the Netherlands, said
countries should have their own policies.
	   ``We don't export our policy like a missionary, it's our own
model,'' said he said.

Police seize weapons at scene of protest in Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with search resuming  &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland (AP) _ With a handful of Orange
Order marchers standing by in a token protest, police continued
searching for explosives and firearms near a rural church Thursday.
	   About 200 supporters of the Protestant order melted away
overnight from a country road leading to the church. Police said
only eight represenatives of the Portadown Orange lodges would be
allowed in while the search continued, and that numbers would have
to be strictly controlled afterward.
	   The Orange Order had been protesting since July 5, when police
and soldiers enforced a government order barring a march through a
Catholic neighborhood.
	   ``While the police will accommodate legitimate and peaceful
protest it will not tolerate the continued use of unarmed
protesters as cover for murderous acts on the security forces,''
Assistant Chief Constable Tom Craig said Wednesday.
	   ``Now is the opportunity to stop the violence and the only way
the Orange Order can control the protests is with limited
numbers.''

Dutch team coach Hiddink takes over at Real Madrid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Guus Hiddink, who coached the Netherlands
to the semifinals of the World Cup, was named new boss at Spanish
powerhouse Real Madrid on Thursday.
	   Hiddink was appointed shortly after midnight with an initial
two-season contract, club chairman Lorenzo Sanz said. He was chosen
over Nevio Scala of Italy.
	   ``After doing a detailed study of Hiddink's career we decided he
was the coach we needed,'' Sanz told reporters. He said the club
was particularly attracted by the imaginative, attacking soccer
Hiddink had pushed for with the Netherlands in the World Cup in
France.
	   Hiddink, 51, takes over from Jose Luis Camacho who resigned last
week after a month on the job because of a contract dispute.
	   Camacho, in turn, had replaced German Juup Heynckes who was let
go in June after one season, despite leading Real to a record
seventh European Champions title in May.
	   Hiddink will be the sixth coach since Sanz was made chairman in
November 1995. Prior to becoming Dutch coach in 1995, Hiddink
headed Spanish club Valencia between 1992-94.
	   On signing the contract, Hiddink said he hoped to break the
curse of one-season coaches at Real Madrid. Historically, coaches
who fail to win the Spanish league or outshine the team's
traditional foe, FC Barcelona, rarely last long at the club.
	   The Spanish season is due to kick off August 30th.

Polish government, opposition compromise on province consolidation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish politicians reached a compromise
Thursday on how to consolidate the country's many provinces, a
reform needed to eliminate communist-era administration and
transfer more power to local government.
	   After weeks of wrangling, Solidarity-led government and
opposition leaders agreed on a motion to replace the current 49
provinces with 16, parliament speaker Maciej Plazynski said.
Parliament is to review the motion Friday.
	   While most politicians support the decentralization plan, the
number of provinces proved a sticking point.
	   An initial government plan for 12 new provinces drew protests
from residents of cities that would lose their status as provincial
capitals. A revised plan for 15 provinces was vetoed on July 2 by
President President Aleksander Kwasniewski, who said it
contradicted the wishes of local communities.
	   Kwasniewski and other leaders of the leftist opposition had
argued that Poland should avoid the controversy by returning to the
17 provinces it had before 1975, when the communists fractured the
country into small provinces that were fully dependent on the
central government in Warsaw.
	   The decentralization reform is to take effect Jan. 1.

Japanese stocks rise for fourth day, dollar lower in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks gained for the fourth consecutive
day Thursday as support was reported growing for a prime minister
candidate known for promoting banking reform. The dollar fell
against the yen.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
117.78 points, or 0.71 percent, and closed at 16,731.92 after
having lost more than 100 points in early trading. It had gained
125.23 points, or 0.76 percent, Wednesday.
	   Investors reacted positively to a Kyodo News report that former
Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama has privately expressed
his desire to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
traders said.
	   Kajiyama's likely bid to succeed Hashimoto also sent the dollar
lower against the yen.
	   The dollar bought 139.72 yen in late afternoon, down 0.94 yen
from late Wednesday and also below its level of 140.50 yen
overnight in New York. The currency ranged between 139.23 yen and
140.95 yen in Thursday's trading.
	   Kajiyama, a senior member of the ruling Liberal Democratic
Party, is an outspoken critic of the Hashimoto administration's
economic policies. He has won plaudits from investors in recent
months by calling for more aggressive measures to fix Japan's
flagging economy and bad loan-plagued banking industry.

Play about Gandhi's assassin debated in parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A play about the man who killed Indian
independence leader Mohandas Gandhi came under fire in India's
parliament Thursday.
	   Speaker G.M.C. Balayogi was hard-pressed to calm angry lawmakers
after newspaper reports about the play, ``Nathuram Godse Speaks,''
were brought up for debate. The play has been running in the
western city of Bombay in recent weeks.
	   ``It is a matter of indescribable shame that not only is Mahatma
Gandhi being vilified, his assassin is being glorified,'' said
Saifuddin Soz, a member of parliament from northern Kashmir state
whose small National Conference party supports the governing
coalition.
	   Gandhi, known as the mahatma or ``great soul,'' was assassinated
in 1948 by Godse. The Hindu nationalist Godse was enraged by
Gandhi's overtures to Muslims after the partition of Britain's
Indian empire into predominantly Hindu India and officially Islamic
Pakistan.
	   Playwright Pradeep Dalvi has told reporters his play was
intended simply to give Godse's views, as well as Gandhi's, a fair
hearing.
	   Ajit Jogi, a lawmaker from the opposition Congress party,
questioned in parliament Thursday why government censors allowed
``Nathuram Godse Speaks'' to be shown.
	   ``Let the people be the judge. The people should be allowed to
make up their minds about what they want to see,'' countered
lawmaker Lalmani Chaube of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata
Party, which leads India's federal governing coalition.
	   Censors in Maharashtra, the state where Bombay is located, have
closed down plays for their sexual content at the insistence of
rightist politicians. The state government is controlled by the BJP
and its extremist partner the Shiv Sena.
	   The parliament debate on ``Nathuram Godse Speaks'' ended with a
pledge from Parliamentary Affairs Minister Madan Lal Khurana to
investigate whether the play glorifies Gandhi's assassin.

	   YEKATERINBURG, Russia (AP) _ Hundreds of Russians prayed, and
some wept, as they paid final tribute Thursday to Russia's last
czar at a hilltop church in this Ural Mountains city where the
royal family was executed 80 years ago.
	   In a solemn ceremony, the wooden coffins of Nicholas II, his
family and their servants were placed in the Ascension of the Lord
Church in Yekaterinburg before being flown to St. Petersburg, where
they will be buried Friday in the old imperial capital.
	   And in a surprise development, President Boris Yeltsin changed
his mind and announced he would attend Friday's service. The
president had been planning to skip the ceremony due to the
multiple controversies that had arisen among political and
religious leaders over how to handle the burial.
	   ``The truth (about the executions) was concealed for 80 years,''
Yeltsin said. ``I was told nothing. And tomorrow, the truth should
be told, and I should take part.''
	   In Yekaterinburg, hundreds of police stood guard around the
church, and people were allowed in a few at a time to pray and
light candles next to the nine small coffins containing the bones.
	   ``I have come to pay a last tribute to the innocent victims,''
said a tearful Vera Kolchina, 74. ``Their deaths were a tragic part
of our history.''
	   Nicholas and his family were executed by Bolshevik
revolutionaries on July 17, 1918, in the basement of a house that
was just down the hill from the site of Thursday's church service.
	   Their bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
Yekaterinburg and remained there until they were unearthed in 1991.
	   The infamous house where they were shot was torn down in the
1980s under the supervision of the local Communist Party boss at
the time _ Yeltsin.
	   As president, Yeltsin originally sought a grandiose burial
ceremony that would serve as an act of repentance for the sins of
Communism. But it was scaled back as the disputes mounted.
	   Ordinary Russians also have mixed feelings about the czar. Some
saw him as a despot, others consider him a martyr, and there are
those who believe he was simply a weak, indecisive ruler
overwhelmed by the tides of history.
	   ``I have come here because it is a historical event and I wanted
my daughter to see it, so she could tell her children about it,''
said Galina Feoktistova, accompanied by her 10-year-old daughter
Yulia.
	   ``I feel pity for the czar, as for any man who died so
tragically,'' she said. But, she added, ``I don't want the monarchy
restored.''
	   About 1,000 people visited the church during the three-hour
service. Afterward, a thunderstorm broke out as an honor guard
began removing the coffins from the church to take them to the
airport.
	   The remains were placed on an Aeroflot cargo jet for the journey
to St. Petersburg.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, three of their
five children and four servants.
	   The coffins of the czar and czarina are draped with the yellow
flag of the Romanov family, and the servants' coffins are lined
with silver, rather than the royal gold.
	   The other two children, Alexei and the one scientists believe is
Maria, were executed along with the entire family, but their
remains have not been found and most investigators believe the
bodies were burned to ashes.
	   There has long been a myth that one of the daughters, Anastasia,
survived the shooting and escaped. But scientific tests indicate
her bones are among the remains and those of her sister Maria are
missing.
	   Extensive DNA testing in the United States, Britain and Russia
convinced scientists of the authenticity of the remains. But the
Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept the results, and top
church officials were not at the services, though local priests
were officiating.

Lawmaker carried weapons into parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An unruly opposition lawmaker who was
thrown out of India's parliament was found to have been armed with
two knives and a gun, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Hindustan Times said doctors discovered the weapons as they
treated Anand Mohan for minor injuries he received in a scuffle
with parliamentary guards as they ejected him from parliament on
Monday. Anand had joined rowdy protests that blocked introduction
of a bill that would have set aside a third of the federal
parliamentary seats for women.
	   The Times said the discovery was reported to the parliament
speaker, and authorities were reviewing security measures. It was
not clear whether Mohan would face censure.
	   Dozens of legislators in the parliament have links with
criminals, and some of them, including Mohan, have criminal
records. Politicians are often accused of using their powerful
positions to slow or derail cases against them.
	   Mohan, a member of the small opposition Rashtriya Janata Party,
is from the northern state of Bihar, which is plagued by violent
crime. Mohan once conducted a parliamentary campaign from prison
and went on to win. He has been linked to cases ranging from arson
to murder.
	   The issue of criminals in politics has been debated for years in
India. Before elections earlier this year, election commissioner
M.S. Gill pleaded with parties not to allow criminals to run, but
acknowledged there was little he could do to stop them.

Ethnic Vietnamese killed in election violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sam Rainsy comment, grafs 7-8 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Three ethnic Vietnamese have been
killed in an attack on a fishing village in what police said
Thursday were the first murders targeting the minority group during
an election campaign filled with vitriol against them.
	   The Vietnamese and another person were killed Wednesday night
when five unidentified gunmen burst into their home in the eastern
province of Kratie and opened fire with automatic weapons,
officials said. The family had lived in Cambodia since 1980.
	   ``It was a terrorist act, because nothing was stolen after
that,'' said Mao Chandara, a senior Interior Ministry police
official. ``I think it marks the harassment of the Vietnamese
before the elections.''
	   The attackers fled in a boat. An investigation was under way in
efforts to curb violence in the run-up to voting July 26. Election
authorities had been informed of the attack.
	   An estimated 200,000 to 1 million ethnic Vietnamese live in
Cambodia, a nation of about 10 million people. Many Cambodians
harbor a deep distrust of Vietnam, which has swallowed up large
tracts of Cambodian territory over the centuries.
	   The major opposition candidates in the elections have played up
anti-Vietnamese rhetoric, saying the country risks being overrun by
illegal immigrants and accusing Vietnam of designs on Cambodia.
	   Speaking to reporters in Kompong Cham province Thursday, Sam
Rainsy acknowledged that he may have inadvertently raised
anti-Vietnamese emotions in some of his campaign speeches, but said
he has ``never advocated violence or the use of violence to solve
these problems.''
	   ``This is the thing we must precisely avoid, to entice people to
violence,'' he said, adding that only legal means must be used in
handling the issue. ``You cannot ignore the problem, the point is
to say how are you going to resolve it.''
	   Cambodian leader Hun Sen is often accused by his opponents of
being a tool of Vietnam. He came to power during the 1980s, when
the country was under harsh Vietnamese military occupation.
	   Vietnamese troops invaded Cambodia in 1979 and toppled the
genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, but many Cambodians feared Hanoi
intended to swallow their country.
	   The Khmer Rouge, now all but extinct, survived for years as a
guerrilla army billing itself as Cambodia's defender against
Vietnam. The group massacred scores of ethnic Vietnamese ahead of
U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. Khmer Rouge raiders also attacked
a Vietnamese fishing village in April, killing 21 people.

Three Korean military commanders fired in alleged spy incursion
</HEADLINE>
case &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL SHIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Defense Ministry fired three navy
and army commanders Thursday, holding them responsible for Sunday's
alleged North Korean spy incursion into South Korea.
	   The ministry also reprimanded two three-star generals for what
it said was their failure to properly conduct the search for two
supposed communist intruders.
	   The search, involving thousands of soldiers and police, was in
its fifth fruitless day Thursday in the rugged mountains of the
east coast.
	   A navy rear admiral, an army major general and an army brigadier
general in charge of defending the east coast were relieved of
their posts. Their replacements were not immediately announced.
	   The sacking came one day after President Kim Dae-jung had
scolded the military for failing to stop the alleged North Korean
infiltration, the second reported in the area in less than a month.
	   At the border village of Panmunjom, the U.N. Command filed a
formal protest with North Korea over the case Thursday, calling it
a ``grave'' armistice violation.
	   It was not immediately known how North Korea responded, but it
previously had denied involvement, calling the case a fabrication
by South Korea.
	   The two men being sought are believed to be companions of a
suspected North Korean agent whose body was found washed ashore
Sunday near a major naval base at Donghae, 195 kilometers (117
miles) east of Seoul.
	   Found with and near the wet suit-clad body were a Czech-made
machine gun, a hand grenade, a portable oxygen tank and a
torpedo-shaped underwater propulsion device capable of carrying up
to five scuba divers.
	   Discovery of the body came only three weeks after a small North
Korean submarine was found entangled in a fishing net off the east
coast.
	   Nine bodies were found in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to death
in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   With no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean
War, the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Their border
is the world's most heavily guarded, with nearly 2 million troops
deployed on both sides.

Israeli air raid after guerrillas kill militiaman in south Lebanon

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla trails in south Lebanon Thursday, hours after
guerrillas killed an Israeli-allied militiaman, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   The planes fired two rockets at the approaches to an Israeli
outpost at Sojod, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) southeast of
Beaufort Castle where the earlier attack occurred, said the
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word of casualties in the air raid.
	   Witnesses said plumes of smoke billowed from the bush around the
Israeli position on the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone.
	   The midmorning air raid came about five hours after Hezbollah
guerrillas fired rifles and mortars at an outpost of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army at Beaufort Castle.
	   Lebanese security officials said one SLA militiaman was killed
in the attack on that outpost, which is about six kilometers (four
miles) northwest of Marjayoun, the main town in the
Israeli-occupied enclave.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah have been waging a guerrilla war to
oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the
zone that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attack.

Extended cargo ban sparks outrage, warnings of layoffs

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Extended cargo shipment troubles at Hong Kong's
new airport, which are expected to bring more financial losses, on
Thursday sparked outrage and warnings of possible layoffs.
	   After a disastrous start at Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok
airport, which opened July 6, the territory's main cargo handler
froze nearly all cargo shipments until July 19.
	   Late Wednesday, it announced that it would not be able to bring
its facility at the new airport up to full speed until the end of
August.
	   Secretary for Trade and Industry Brian Chau said the delay would
cost Hong Kong 0.1 percent of this year's gross domestic product,
or about 1.3 billion Hong Kong dollars (dlrs 168 million).
	   ``Like most Hong Kong people, I'm disappointed, and I'm angry,''
Chau told reporters. ``This shouldn't, and couldn't be happening.''
	   Chau said the cargo limitations were unfair to small and medium
businesses, the backbone of Hong Kong's once-robust economy,
especially at a time when it is slipping into recession. The
company, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, ``should be condemned,''
Chau said.
	   Legislator James Tien, chairman of the influential General
Chamber of Commerce, said some factories have been cutting
operating hours, and might have to lay off workers because of lack
of supplies from overseas.
	   Tien said manufacturers of toys and clothing would be the
hardest hit because August and September are their peak export
season.
	   Legislator Lee Cheuk-yan, secretary-general for the
Confederation of Trade Unions, said he worried that employers would
use this as an excuse to fire workers or cut wages during the
economic downturn.
	   Computer problems destroyed much of the handler's air cargo
data, forcing the closure.
	   Although the company largely has avoided finger-pointing, it
says it never promised to have the new site operating fully by
early July.
	   And the government has faced accusations that it pushed the
airport opening ahead too fast to coincide with the first
anniversary of the return to Chinese rule. Chinese President Jiang
Zemin visited on the anniversary, and dedicated the airport.
	   Air cargo shipments have resumed partially, and officials said
the new airport handled 2,437 tons of cargo Wednesday, about half
of normal. Passengers services are back to normal, officials said.
	   Hong Kong officials struck a deal Wednesday with the mainland
for airlines to use Huangtian airport in the bordering mainland
city of Shenzhen. Officials said Huangtian could handle up to 30
percent of the territory's usual cargo. Some airlines also have
been using the airport in the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau.
	   Kenny Ku, vice president of the Association of Small and Medium
Businesses and a toy and gifts trader, said most members would use
the mainland airports only as a last resort because of inefficiency
and customs procedures.
	   Some members have been shipping cargo by sea to airports in the
Middle East, Singapore and Japan before re-routing them by air to
Europe and the United States, he said.
	   Traders are advising overseas clients to stop exporting, and
banks are tightening credit because of delayed shipments, he said.
Some cargo was stuck in overseas ports because airmail shipping
documents from Hong Kong were lost in the chaos, he added.
	   However, there was general agreement that if the present
problems are fixed, the ban was unlikely to cost Hong Kong its
reputation as the region's top cargo hub.
	   Its efficiency and capacity still are unmatched in the region.
Michael Enright, an economist at Hong Kong University, said it also
was one of the most open ports in Asia.
	   ``As long as it is at that time working at peak efficiency, Hong
Kong is still and still will be the major air hub in the region,''
Enright said. ``It's difficult (for other airports) to ram up the
capacity quickly.''

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's broadest measure of trade jumped 62 percent
in May from a year ago, the government announced Thursday.
	   Japan's current account surplus, unadjusted for seasonal
factors, was at 1.409 trillion yen (dlrs 10.03 billion) in May, up
62.2 percent from the same month last year, the Finance Ministry
announced.
	   The rise, higher than Tokyo-based economists had forecast,
marked the 14th consecutive monthly year-on-year increase in the
surplus.
	   The current account measures the difference between income from
foreign sources and foreign obligations payable, excluding net
capital investment.
	   Japan has come under increasing pressure to revive its sluggish
economy to import more goods and cap a ballooning surplus.
	   But while both exports and imports declined in May, the drop in
the latter far outpaced that of the former, the ministry said.
	   Exports fell 1.8 percent from the same month a year ago, while
imports declined 18.1 percent, the ministry said.
	   The ministry said that while it doesn't forecast large rises in
the surplus over the long term, it will likely continue to expand
in the short term.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The Australian government announced
plans on Thursday to deregulate the country's state-run postal
service by allowing competition for price and delivery time on
items weighing more than 1.7 ounces (50 grams).
	   Communications Minister Richard Alston promised the reforms
would not lead to a raising of the cost of mailing a standard
letter.
	   Items weighing less the amount subject to price competition will
be subject to a price fixed until at least the year 2003, meaning
private mail carriers can only compete for this type of mail on the
basis of faster delivery times, the minister said.
	   Australia Post currently has a price and delivery monopoly on
all packages weighing less than 8.8 ounces (250 grams).
	   The changes follow a review of Australia Post by the country's
National Competition Council and will take effect from July 1,
2000.
	   Other reforms announced Thursday include ending Australia Post's
monopoly on handling incoming international mail, introducing
discounts for bulk mailers who use bar-codes, dropping the limit on
bulk mail discounts from 2,500 items to 300 and tendering out
sections of postal delivery routes.
	   But the federal government rejected the council's recommendation
that all of Australia Post's business mail be deregulated.
	   Australia Post managing director Graeme John said the reforms
would not mean closures of post offices.
	   Under the changes, about 88 percent of Australia Post's business
would be open to competition, John said.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's finance and securities
companies lost nearly 55 billion baht (dlrs 1.3 billion) in 1997,
according to a report released Thursday by the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
	   In 1996, the industry compiled profits of 13.8 billion (dlrs 552
million, at that year's exchange rate).
	   The stunning turnaround came after Thailand floated its
currency, the baht, on July 2, 1997, and it promptly lost between
40 and 50 percent of its value.
	   That proved disastrous for many of the country's 93 finance
companies, which found they were unable to recover loans, mainly
from real estate developers who had large amounts of unhedged
foreign currency debt and were going bankrupt.
	   In addition, many of the finance companies had their own foreign
currency loans, which became more costly to repay as the baht fell.
	   The government was forced to shut down and liquidate the assets
of 54 of the finance companies that had become insolvent.
	   The SEC report attributed the sector's losses to declining loan
revenues and asset quality, higher funding costs and
foreign-exchange losses.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's consumer price index
rose 6.2 percent in June from its year earlier level, compared with
a 5.4 percent increase in May, the national news agency Bernama
reported Thursday.
	   For the year's first six months, inflation amounted to 5.0
percent from January-June last year.
	   The inflation rate is getting closer to the government's latest
forecast of 7 to 8 percent this year. However, independent
economists suggest the inflation rate could reach double digits by
the end of the year.
	   Checking inflation is one of the major challenges facing
Malaysia as it slips into recession. Higher prices could further
aggravate the woes of citizens who have lost jobs or suffered
reduced earnings in the last year.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A relieved Indonesia on Thursday
welcomed an International Monetary Fund decision to restart lending
to it, saying the release of a dlrs 1 billion installment would
bring some relief to its battered economy.
	   Indonesia's top economic minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, said
the decision would boost the value of the sagging rupiah against
the U.S. dollar and provide badly needed foreign exchange reserves.
	   The IMF approved the release of the money in Washington
Wednesday as part of a dlrs 43 billion rescue plan.
	   It also agreed to a dlrs 1.3 billion increase in an existing
standby credit facility to Indonesia, and announced that more than
dlrs 6 billion from various official sources would be available by
the end of March 1999.
	   Indonesia's economy is suffering its worst crisis in 30 years.
It has been the hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   The IMF and Indonesian officials agreed on a bailout program
last year. However, the plan stalled several times when the IMF
complained that then-President Suharto was not living up to
promises to reform the economy.

Austria seeks pledges from Europeans to shelter Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria fears a rising tide of refugees
from Serbia's Kosovo province and will ask other European countries
to share the burden, Interior Minister Karl Schloegl said Thursday.
	   Schloegl spoke in an interview with Austrian state radio prior
to a meeting with interior ministers from Germany, Italy, France
and Switzerland in Gaschurn, western Austria.
	   Tens of thousands have fled the fighting in Kosovo in recent
weeks, most of them arriving in northern Albania and in Montenegro,
the smaller republic in what is left of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   ``I fear that we are only at the beginning of the problem of
migration and a mass exodus from Kosovo,'' Schoegl said. ``If the
reports I have are correct there will be no letup in Kosovo.''
	   He said Austria would be overstrained by a major refugee
movement across its borders, adding the talks with his colleagues
were designed to help find a common answer to the problem.
	   Mass migrations following armed conflicts such as in Kosovo
cannot be absorbed by one single country, Schloegl said in the
interview, and refugees _ and the costs of their upkeep _ should be
distributed among the 15 member countries of the European Union.
	   The minister made clear that Austria would not be in a position
to shelter as many refugees from Kosovo as from former Yugoslavia
during the Bosnian war when a total of 92,000 refugees arrived in
Austria _ the largest number per capita of the resident population
in any EU member country. Austria has a population of about eight
million.

Hong Kong shares close higher on stronger yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong shares closed higher Thursday, after
a stronger yen relieved fears of a new round of Asian currency
turmoil and lifted stock markets across the region.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
closed at 8,685.57, up 130.35 points, or 1.5 percent. The index has
gained 6 percent in the past three sessions.
	   The index opened lower and climbed gradually following the yen's
strong performance, but slight profit-taking pushed down prices
near the close.
	   Market volume reached 4.29 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
550 million), compared with 4.64 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 594 million) Wednesday.
	   The yen broke through the psychological barrier of 140 to the
U.S. dollar, feeding positive sentiment in regional markets,
analysts said.
	   George Chan, research manager of Celestial Research Ltd., said
Hong Kong stocks received a boost from the news that Japan's former
chief Cabinet secretary, Seiroku Kajiyama, may seek the leadership
of the Liberal Democratic Party.
	   The party's chief is customarily nominated as prime minister
because the party holds a majority in the lower house of
Parliament.
	   Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto announced Monday he would
resign because of the party's humiliating setback in Sunday's
elections for the Upper House.

Philippine Muslim rebels accuse government of insincerity in
</HEADLINE>
stalled talks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COTABATO, Philippines (AP) _ Muslim rebels accused the new
Philippine government Thursday of insincerity because of delays in
the naming of new negotiators in peace talks suspended during
national elections in May.
	   ``The government is apparently not interested in pursuing the
peace initiative by (former) President Fidel Ramos,'' said Al-haj
Murad, vice chairman of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front.
	   Murad said new President Joseph Estrada ``appears to be
reluctant to form the government peace panel.''
	   Murad said the delay is the major cause of skirmishes in recent
weeks in the southern Philippines.
	   On Wednesday, Col. Nestor Castillo, chief of the military's
civil relations service, called the MILF guerrillas insincere in
pursuing peace talks because of the recent clashes.
	   Last week, the military and the MILF agreed to a temporary truce
after fighting in North Cotabato province left at least two farmers
dead and a disputed number of combatants killed or wounded.
	   About 2,500 Muslim and Christian farmers fled their homes to
escape the fighting.
	   ``If the talks are not resumed soon, skirmishes will take place.
That is to be expected,'' Murad said. ``Who is insincere between us
now?''
	   The two sides have conflicting explanations of who started the
clash.
	   The rebels said the fighting began when about 50 government
soldiers and militiamen entered Kabpangi village without informing
the rebels who occupy the area that they were passing through, as
provided under a cease-fire agreement.
	   The military, however, said about 200 Muslim rebels entered the
area and started confiscating farm animals from Christian settlers.
The military said the rebels executed three farmers.
	   The rebels said they will file a complaint over the incident
with the government when peace talks resume.
	   The MILF, which has been holding peace talks with the government
since last year, is the bigger of two Muslim groups still fighting
the government. The largest Muslim rebel group, the Moro National
Liberation Front, signed a peace pact in 1996.

Insect plagues destroy pasture on Tibetan plateau
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Plagues of locusts and caterpillars are chewing
their way through millions of acres (hectares) of pasture land on
the Tibetan plateau, threatening livestock farmers' livelihoods,
China's state-run Xinhua News said Thursday.
	   The insects have stripped some grasslands practically bare in
their spread over 8,695 square kilometers (3,344 square miles) of
western Qinghai province since June, Xinhua said. Even poisonous
grasses have been eaten, it said.
	   Furthermore, the poor and sparsely populated province only has
funds to kill the pests on about one-tenth of the affected 866,600
hectares (2.14 million acres), Xinhua said.
	   Up to 400 locusts and 1,000 caterpillars per square meter
(square yard) have been found around Qinghai Lake, China's largest
saltwater lake, about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) west of Beijing,
Xinhua said.
	   Qinghai's provincial government estimates that the plague will
destroy 20 to 80 percent of fresh grass in affected areas, it said.
	   About 95 percent of Qinghai's 720,000 square kilometers (288,000
square miles) is pasture, and sheep, cattle and goat raising are
vital to the local economy.

No one jumping for Rwanda tribunal job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS in 8th graf that tribunal has 31 suspects in custody
STED 23 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The international tribunal for Rwanda,
criticized for its slow pace and winning only one conviction in
more than three years, is facing another problem: too few judges.
	   The U.N. chief has only come up with five of the necessary 18
candidates to fill a new third chamber that was approved by the
Security Council in April.
	   On Wednesday, the council gave Secretary-General Kofi Annan
another month, until Aug. 4, to come up with more candidates.
	   The job, however, is tough to fill. Terms run through May 24,
2003, and judges can't hold any other job during that time.
	   The court is in Arusha, Tanzania and _ unlike the U.N. tribunal
for Yugoslavia at the Hague, Netherlands _ has less than adequate
facilities, administrative and other support systems, court
staffers have complained.
	   In February 1997, U.N. inspector-general Karl Paschke reported
serious administrative and management deficiencies in court offices
that prompted Annan to replace the chief administrator and the
deputy prosecutor.
	   The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda was established
November 1994 to try those accused of masterminding and carrying
out the slaughter by Hutu extremists of more than 500,000 Rwandan
Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
	   The tribunal has indicted 35 people, including 31 suspects in
custody and awaiting trial. All face maximum life sentences. Only
one person has been convicted, the former prime minister, and he
pled guilty to genocide and crimes against humanity.
	   So far, Annan has passed along candidates to try the cases from
Senegal, Russia, South Africa, Nepal and Tanzania.

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes fired missiles at
suspected guerrilla trails in south Lebanon Thursday, hours after
guerrillas killed an Israeli-allied militiaman, Lebanese security
officials said.
	   The planes fired two rockets at the approaches to an Israeli
outpost at Sojod, about two kilometers (1.2 miles) southeast of
Beaufort Castle where the earlier attack occurred, said the
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word of casualties in the air raid.
	   Witnesses said plumes of smoke billowed from the bush around the
Israeli position on the edge of the Israeli-occupied zone in south
Lebanon.
	   The midmorning air raid came about five hours after Hezbollah
guerrillas fired rifles and mortars at an outpost of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army at Beaufort Castle.
	   Lebanese security officials said one SLA militiaman was killed
in the attack on that outpost, which is about six kilometers (four
miles) northwest of Marjayoun, the main town in the
Israeli-occupied enclave.
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah has been waging a guerrilla war to
oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA militiamen from the
zone that Israel set up in 1985 to protect its northern territory
from guerrilla attack.

Players union, owners discuss international play
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Players union head Donald Fehr and baseball
owners have entered into discussions about international play,
including the Olympics and a World Cup-style tournament, The New
York Times reported Thursday.
	   ``There's a feeling that there's a lot of work to do and there's
an opportunity out there,'' Fehr said after a meeting Wednesday.
``We have to come up with an operating plan.''
	   Paul Beeston, major league baseball's chief operating officer,
told the newspaper that the talks included the November all-star
tour of Japan; the potential of playing games outside of the United
States and Canada; the qualifying rounds for the 2000 Olympics; the
type of players who could be in the Olympics; and an international
tournament based on soccer's World Cup.
	   ``I think it was a very good, very productive and an exciting
meeting,'' Beeston said. ``Don articulated the union's position,
and it's consistent with our position. We had six club
representatives, and they can see Don has a vision and a
commitment, a plan that is not at counter with anything we want to
do. I think we can work very well together.''
	   Beeston and Fehr will travel to Italy next week for the world
championships and an International Baseball Association executive
board meeting. The IBA is the certifying body for the Olympics.

Young lawmakers revolt delays vote on Hashimoto replacement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with ruling party postponing vote &QL; 
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Opposition by younger lawmakers to backroom
politicking forced Japan's troubled ruling party Thursday to
postpone voting on a replacement for resigning Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, the favorite of old-guard party
power brokers, had appeared set to walk away with the job as the
Liberal Democratic Party's president in a vote on July 21.
	   But in a meeting of all the party's members of Parliament
Thursday, dissenters forced the party to delay that vote until July
24 to make candidates explain where they stand on issues.
	   ``There's a problem with the way our party chooses its
president,'' LDP lower house representative Tsutomu Hakebe told the
gathering of LDP lawmakers. ``The voters are demanding an open
debate.''
	   Though the delay is only for three days, it comes as Japan's
government is under mounting pressure at home and abroad to find a
successor to Hashimoto and move fast to fix Japan's recessionary
economy.
	   Hashimoto was forced to announce his resignation Monday after
the LDP was trounced in elections for the upper house of
Parliament.
	   Part of the problem is Obuchi himself. The 60-year-old lawmaker
is seen as a party regular who has put in long, loyal service but
lacks charisma _ not the sort of man many members want at the helm
as the party tries to win back public support.
	   One senior lawmaker, former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku
Kajiyama, is already moving to challenge Obuchi's candidacy. Health
and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi is seen as another possible
contender.
	   Obuchi remains the apparent front-runner for the party's top
spot, having reportedly won the support of a large faction within
the LDP.
	   Obuchi already is a leader of the party's largest faction,
headed by former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita. Newspapers
reported that support within the party has largely been built up
because of intense lobbying by Takeshita himself.
	   Obuchi was expected to formally announce his candidacy during
the next two days.
	   Japan's Kyodo News reported that Kajiyama had informed other
party leaders Thursday of his intentions to run, but his aides
refused to confirm that report.
	   They said an announcement would likely be made soon.
	   The party's leader is virtually assured of becoming prime
minister because of the LDP's majority in Parliament's lower house.
Formal approval of the new prime minister was expected before the
end of the month.
	   Most analysts agree the LDP's weekend defeat in elections for
half the seats in the upper house of Parliament was a stunning
rebuke by voters for Hashimoto's handling of Japan's
recession-bound economy.
	   Younger party members have openly expressed outrage over the
party's apparent willingness to back Obuchi without his even making
a public statement about what he would do to turn the economy
around.
	   ``We don't even know the policies of the people we're supposed
to be voting for,'' LDP lawmaker Taro Kono, 35, said after
Thursday's meeting.
	   Other lawmakers expressed concern that a failure by the LDP to
change its ways could lead to another rout at the polls _ and loss
of control of the Cabinet, something that has only happened once in
the last 43 years.
	   ``If we don't pay more attention to the voters' voice, we're in
trouble,'' said LDP lawmaker Makiko Tanaka, 54, one of the party's
sharpest internal critics.
	   ``But at this point, we're just throwing forth candidates like
we were running a garage sale.''

Israeli-allied South Lebanese militiamen face political wilderness

	   ASHDOD, Israel (AP) _ A 53-year-old major in the South Lebanon
Army, Israel's proxy militia, spoke for several of his comrades
when he said he has been victimized by his country's turbulent
history.
	   A resident of south Lebanon, he is considered a traitor by most
of his countrymen and can't visit his sons in Beirut. At the same
time, his Israeli patrons may eventually withdraw their protective
umbrella and leave the 2,500 SLA militiamen and their families in
Israel's occupation zone in south Lebanon vulnerable to revenge
attacks by Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas.
	   In a routine attempt to shore up morale, Israel hosted dozens of
SLA commanders and community leaders Wednesday in the Israeli city
of Ashdod for a two-day getaway from the troubles of Lebanon.
	   Thousands of south Lebanese have fled from their homes over the
years, tired of Israeli troops and various guerrilla groups
fighting in their backyards. But many also stayed, some sided with
Israel hoping to get the guerrillas out first, others joined the
militant groups trying to oust the Israelis. About 120,000 people
live in the 440-square-mile (1,100-square-kilometer) zone patrolled
by the SLA and Israeli troops.
	   In most cases, alliances were a matter of economics.
	   Israel allows family members of SLA soldiers to work in Israel
where wages are substantially higher than in Lebanon, children of
SLA officers are treated to holidays at Israeli summer camps, and
soldiers are well looked after.
	   Qasem Alayan, the leader of Bayada village in south Lebanon,
complained that his compatriots have unfairly labeled them as
traitors in a situation where all the power-brokers were
foreigners.
	   ``We are like a man who has two wives: They are both a headache.
It makes no difference whether we are governed by Israel or our
state,'' he said, at a luncheon hosted by the Israeli army.
	   Fighting between the two sides has been costly for both Israel
and the SLA, which have both lost hundreds of soldiers in years of
battle with Hezbollah. On Wednesday, Israeli President Ezer Weizman
reflected growing public sentiment by calling on the government to
find a way to end its presence in south Lebanon.
	   Israel has said it's ready to leave if the Lebanese government
would offer assurances to protect Israeli border settlements from
attack. What would happen to its allies in such a case is not clear
but Israeli lawmakers have long said any deal should include
guarantees for the safety of SLA soldiers and their families who
may be targets of Hezbollah after Israel leaves.
	   Four SLA soldiers have already approached the Israeli government
through a lawyer for guarantees of citizenship or asylum after a
withdrawal.
	   Most SLA soldiers say they don't believe Israel would abandon
them.
	   ``There will never be a day when we are afraid of Israel
withdrawing and leaving us alone in the south,'' said the SLA
major, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   ``If Israel leaves, there will be arrangements,'' he said,
adding that one option could be to incorporate the militia into the
Lebanese army.
	   If a deal is reached however, it won't be easy for Israel and
the people of south Lebanon to simply part ways. After years of
taking up the other's cause, they've become more than neighbors.
	   At Wednesday's gathering in Ashdod, Israeli and SLA commanders
in similar army dress seemed totally at ease with one another,
swapping jokes in Arabic about the Viagra anti-impotency pill and
the future of Mideast peace.
	   Alayan said he's sure it's too early for good-byes.
	   ``Israel won't leave in my lifetime. They have been saying
`tomorrow' for 20 years,'' he said.

Volvo half-year profit down 23 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish automaker AB Volvo on Thursday
reported a pretax profit of 6.11 billion kronor (dlrs 765 million)
for the first half of 1998, a 23-percent drop from the same period
a year ago.
	   The profit came on sharply increased sales of 101.7 billion
kronor (dlrs 12.7 billion), up from 89 billion kronor in the first
six months of 1997. Volvo reported North American sales had
increased 26 percent and were up 13 percent in Europe.
	   ``That more than compensated for the decline in Asia,'' the
company said in a statement.
	   Much of this half-year's profit came from capital gains and
other one-time factors, including 2.13 billion kronor (dlrs 266
million) from the sale of shares. Similar gains from the same
period a year ago were 3.27 billion kronor.
	   The company's statement did not address recent speculation that
Volvo and Germany's Volkswagen are considering a merger or an
alliance.

Takanohana keeps sole lead at 12-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAGOYA, Japan (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Takanohana stayed
undefeated and opened a two-victory lead Thursday as he beat his
closest rival with three days left in the 15-day Nagoya Grand Sumo
Tournament.
	   Takanohana improved to 12-0 by driving out No. 9 maegashira
(senior wrestler) Kotonowaka after a battle of arm throw attempts.
	   That left Kotonowaka tied at 10-2 with ozeki (champion)
Musashimaru, who threw down yokozuna Akebono in a bout between two
wrestlers from Hawaii.
	   Both new yokozuna Wakanohana and ozeki Takanonami suffered
defeats and stood at 9-3, one victory ahead of Akebono, or Chad
Rowan.
	   If Takanohana wins and both Musashimaru and Kotonowaka lose
Friday, Takanohana will clinch his 19th tournament title.
Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, has won three tournaments.
	   Sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai crashed hard against
Wakanohana with his head and sent him out, leaving both wrestlers
at 9-3.
	   No. 4 maegashira Dejima (8-4) held off Takanonami's pulling
attempts and bulldozed him out.
	   No. 8 maegashira Aogiyama drove No. 11 maegashira Kyokushuzan,
or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, to the ring's edge with hand thrusts
and suddenly pulled him down, leaving both wrestlers at 7-5.
	   No. 15 maegashira Kyokutenho, or Tsevegnyam Nyamjav, was thrust
down by No. 16 maegashira Asanowaka (6-6) for his ninth defeat
against three victories.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 16-ranked Kaishinzan,
or American Henry Armstrong Miller, was sent out from behind by No.
8-ranked Yachi for his third defeat against three victories.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 17-ranked
Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, sent out No. 14-ranked
Kotohikari for his fourth victory against two defeats.
	   No. 65-ranked Azumakaze, or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda,
was forced out by No. 74-ranked Kaiko for his second defeat against
four victories.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

Festina team director suspended; he and doctor still in detention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHOLET, France (AP) _ Festina team director Bruno Roussel was
suspended from his cycling functions Thursday due to the growing
drug controversy surrounding his team, meaning he is temporarily
out of the Tour de France.
	   The International Cycling Union announced Thursday morning, just
before the start of the Tour's fifth stage, that Roussel had failed
to respond adequately to an investigation from the French Cycling
Federation.
	   It said it had suspended his cycling license, and therefore he
will not be able to work on the Tour de France.
	   But Jean-Marie LeBlanc, the Tour de France director, said there
was no reason to suspend the team from competing for the moment.
The police conducted a search of the riders' rooms on Wednesday.
	   Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were still in detention in
Cholet, after being taken in for questioning by police following
Wednesday's stage.
	   Police from the northern city of Lille came down to conduct the
investigation. That's where a Belgian member of the Festina team
has been under arrest since last week, when he was found with a
stash of performance-enhancing drugs in a team car.
	   The Festina team issued a statement Wednesday saying Roussel
wished to be heard.
	   He got his wish later, when police offically detained him.
French law allows detention of up to 48 hours before further
action.
	   Festina's main sponsors, the Spanish watch company Festina, are
threatening to break their contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen shot and killed a Sunni Muslim
leader Thursday in a congested old quarter of southern Karachi,
prompting retaliatory violence that left two people dead, police
officials said.
	   Paramilitary troops and scores of policemen were deployed in the
area to prevent retaliatory attacks. However, gunmen shot and
killed two people in the area, police said.
	   Shops in the area quickly shuttered and people stayed indoors
following the shooting, eyewitnesses said.
	   No one took responsibility for the killing of the Sunni leader
Saleem Raza, who was shot by three gunmen as he stepped out of his
home.
	   Raza was rushed to a nearby hospital where he died, said
hospital officials.
	   Hundreds of mourners gathered at the hospital, wailing and
demanding that the culprits be captured.
	   Within hours of Raza's killing two people were shot and killed
in the same area. Policemen said it was in retaliation for Raza's
death.
	   A teeming city of 14 million people, Karachi has been wracked in
recent months by relentless violence between rival factions of an
ethnic militant party.
	   Also on Thursday, police discovered the tortured bodies of two
people. They believe the two men were killed in connection with the
rivalry between factions of the Mohajir Qami Movement, which
represents Indian Muslims who settled here after 1947 and the
creation of Pakistan as a homeland for the region's Muslims.
	   While Karachi has been the scene of religiously motivated
killings, it has been months since one has occurred.
	   Police said they were investigating the shooting. The killings
of Sunni Muslims have been blamed on militant members of rival
Shiite Muslim groups. Most Pakistanis are Sunni Muslims, who have
no quarrel with their Shiite brethren. It is small groups of
heavily armed militants who routinely clash.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Nobel Peace Prize winner Carlos Belo,
a Roman Catholic bishop in East Timor, accused Indonesians Thursday
of raping women in the disputed territory since Indonesian forces
invaded in 1975.
	   Belo made his claim at a seminar in Jakarta, just hours after a
special U.N. envoy arrived to seek a solution to the conflict in
the former Portuguese colony, which is to mark 22 years of
integration with Indonesia on Friday.
	   ``Women in East Timor have experienced (rape) since 1975,'' Belo
said. ``That is why until now they have never accepted
integration'' with Indonesia.
	   Belo, the co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize, said he
witnessed rapes when he was among thousands of refugees from the
invasion at the town of Atambua, on the land border with West
Timor. He said about 4,000 women were there.
	   He said he saw members of Indonesia's civil defense force,
Hansip, enter the quarters of female refugees and undress them.
	   Belo's accusation, in response to a question at the seminar,
came a day after Indonesian President B.J. Habibie promised that
his government would take tough measures to prevent rape.
	   Habibie condemned as ``inhuman'' the rape of dozens of women and
girls during riots across Indonesia two months ago.
	   Women's groups say at least 168 were sexually assaulted,
including 20 who died as a result of the attacks.
	   The riots led to Suharto's resignation as president after 32
years of autocratic rule. About 1,200 people died in the violence,
and thousands of homes and buildings were looted and burned.
	   ``I express my deepest regret at the violence, which runs
counter to the nation's cultural values,'' Habibie said in a speech
to women's groups Wednesday.
	   ``I promise the government will be proactive in giving
protection and security to all layers of society to prevent a
repetition of this inhuman episode of history of the nation,'' he
said.
	   ``On behalf of the government and the nation, I condemn the
simultaneous acts of violence during the riots, including the
violence perpetrated against women.''
	   It was Habibie's first direct condemnation of the rapes that
activists say were mainly carried out against members of
Indonesia's ethnic Chinese minority.
	   Chinese make up a small fraction of Indonesia's 202 million
population. But they dominate industry and commerce and have become
the scapegoats for the worst economic crisis in 30 years.

Bodyguards capture intruder inside premier's residence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ A young man from the strife-torn Serbian
Kosovo province, who was armed with a knife, has been captured
inside the downtown residence of Premier Fatos Nano, an Interior
Ministry source said Thursday.
	   The incident occurred on Tuesday after 10 p.m. when the Kosovo
Albanian, identified as 19-year-old Faruk Mazreku, who was born in
Pristina but is a Belgrade resident, was stopped by bodyguards.
	   He had already entered the villa of the Nano family through a
backyard window, the source, requesting anonymity, told The
Associated Press.
	   No other details were available from the Interior Ministry. The
premier was not at home at the time of the incident in which nobody
was hurt.
	   Mazreku was reported in police detention, and the Albanian
intelligence service has launched an investigation.

Philippine peso edges higher; stocks close mixed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine peso edged higher
against the U.S. dollar Thursday, spurred by an afternoon rally by
the Japanese yen. Stocks closed mixed as regional uncertainties
continued to weigh on the market, dealers said.
	   After a dull morning session, the peso was swept higher in the
afternoon by gains in the yen on news that former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama is considering seeking the position of
prime minister of Japan.
	   The rally brought the peso toward the key level of 41.50 pesos
to the dollar, but gains subsided on what one trader termed
``bargain hunting'' for dollars.
	   The dollar averaged 41.662 pesos for the day, down from 41.702
pesos Wednesday. It dipped as low as 41.580 pesos in afternoon
trading.
	   In stock trading, shares closed mixed Thursday as regional
uncertainties, particularly in Japan, offset gains from selected
buying, traders said.
	   Domestic news lifted a few stocks, but losers still beat gainers
40 to 29. There were 52 issues unchanged.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index edged 2.94 points
higher to 1,797.00 after gaining 9.19 points Wednesday.
	   The broader All Shares Index was off 0.06 point to 560.85, a
reversal from Wednesday's gain of 1.31 points.
	   Among the day's top gainers was C and P Homes Inc. Its shares
rallied 7.4 percent on news that its chairman, congressman Manuel
Villar, has received overwhelming support from legislators in his
bid to become the next speaker of the House of Representatives.
	   ``The market is basically consolidating ..., awaiting
developments in the region, particularly in Japan,'' said Lourdes
Cinco, research head of Eastern Securities Development Corp.
	   She said trading continues to be thin and is likely to remain so
as investors wait for developments in Japan as well as on the
domestic front.
	   The government budget deficit is widening, inflation is rising,
banks' non-performing loans are increasing, the peso remains
volatile and corporate earnings are still weak.
	   Ricky del Rosario, analyst for Angping and Associates
Securities, said buying will likely be limited to shares with
positive news. Overall, developments in Japan and in China will be
key factors for the market, he said.

China accuses Taiwan of buying U.N. bid, assails supporters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China accused Taiwan Thursday of using its wealth
to persuade Nicaragua and 10 other countries to support the
island's bid for U.N. membership.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang had equally harsh words
for the 11 countries, accusing them of forsaking principle for
profit.
	   ``The Taiwan authorities, acting against the trend of the times,
again bought up some countries to submit this issue,'' Tang said.
This ``expose(s) the Taiwan authorities obstinate position in
splitting the motherland.
	   ``Meanwhile, some other countries openly disregard the
aspirations of the majority of U.N. members and at the sight of
profit forget what is right,'' Tang said at a twice-weekly media
briefing.
	   The countries urged this week, for the sixth straight year, that
Taiwan's status be discussed at the annual General Assembly
session. The bid has failed each time as China, a permanent member
of the U.N. Security Council, has veto power.
	   Still the issue infringes upon two of China's touchiest
political issues: its national sovereignty and goal to reunite the
country. Taiwan is the last and most stubborn patch of imperial
China not resigned to Beijing's rule.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang noted the United Nations' 1971
decision to eject Taiwan, which then claimed to represent all of
China, and give its seat to Beijing. He called that move ``the
victory of justice and jurisprudence.''
	   By trying to readmit Taiwan, Nicaragua and the other countries
committed an ``abrupt intervention into China's internal affairs
and a willful violation of the principles and purposes of the U.N.
charter,'' Tang said.
	   ``We would like to express our strong condemnation,'' he added.
	   In a major blow to Taiwanese efforts to win greater worldwide
recognition, U.S. President Bill Clinton publicly vowed not to
support the island's bids to join the United Nations and other
international organizations that require sovereign status.
	   Clinton aides and the Congress, however, have reaffirmed
commitments to aid Taiwan's defense, something that Beijing
maintains violates a U.S. pledge in 1982 to phase out arms sales to
the island.
	   ``The Taiwan issue has all along been the most important,
sensitive core issue in China-U.S. relations,'' Tang said. ``The
U.S. side in handling the Taiwan issue should strictly act in
accordance with the commitments it has made.''

Basque paper shut over links to ETA comes out under new name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain, July 16 (AP) _ A Basque newspaper that was shut
down over its links to armed separatists came out Thursday with a
new name, a skeleton format and a vow to keep publishing.
	   A day after being closed by a judge probing the fundraising
network of the separatist group ETA, the newspaper Egin renamed
itself ``Basque Country News.''
	   The eight-page edition featured a banner headline in the Basque
language proclaiming ``We will save Egin'' and a photo of hooded
police sealing off its headquarters in the town of Hernani on
Wednesday.
	   The paper, published in the Basque city of San Sebastian, was
delivered in person by Egin journalists to several news
organizations in the region. It was not available at newsstands.
	   National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon ordered Egin and an
affiliated radio station closed, on grounds that they that had
close links to ETA's fundraising efforts.
	   Police also arrested 11 current or former board members at the
parent company of the two news outlets, Orain S.A.
	   Virtually all of Spain's political parties endorsed the judge's
actions, saying freedom of expression had limits. Egin regularly
published statements by ETA, including its claims of responsibility
for attacks.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its
campaign for independence.
	   Mainstream newspapers were divided over the closedown. Some
expressed begrudging acceptance but others said the move was
heavy-handed and might backfire by giving Egin martyr status for
Basque nationalists.
	   The center-right daily El Mundo noted that Egin was the first
newspaper shut down in Spain since democracy was restored following
the death of Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975 after a 36-year
dictatorship.
	   ``As detestable and repugnant as it may be,'' the paper said of
Egin, ``it was nonetheless a news medium. Its absence will reduce
society's pluralism.''
	   The center-left El Pais said it was now up to the country's
judicial authorities to demonstrate that the action against Egin
and the radio was justified.
	   The new Basque Country News dedicated all of its coverage
Thursday to the pre-dawn police raids on its offices in Hernani and
three other cities in the Basque country and neighboring Navarra.
	   One article on the operation was headlined, ``an attack under
cover of darkness, with premeditation and treachery.''

Austria seeks pledges from Europeans to shelter Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria fears a rising tide of refugees
from Serbia's Kosovo province and will ask other European countries
to share the burden, Interior Minister Karl Schloegl said Thursday.
	   Schloegl spoke in an interview with Austrian state radio prior
to a meeting with interior ministers from Germany, Italy, France
and Switzerland in the western Austrian town of Gaschurn.
	   Tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians have fled the fighting in
Kosovo in recent weeks, most of them arriving in northern Albania
and in Montenegro, the smaller republic in what is left of
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   ``I fear that we are only at the beginning of the problem of
migration and a mass exodus from Kosovo,'' Schoegl said. ``If the
reports I have are correct there will be no letup in Kosovo.''
	   He said Austria would be overstrained by a major refugee
movement across its borders. He added that the talks with his
colleagues were designed to help find a common answer to the
problem.
	   Mass migrations following armed conflicts such as in Kosovo
cannot be absorbed by any single country, Schloegl said in the
interview. He said refugees _ and the costs of their upkeep _
should be distributed among the 15 member countries of the European
Union.
	   The minister made clear that Austria would not be in a position
to shelter as many refugees from Kosovo as from former Yugoslavia
during the Bosnian war when a total of 92,000 refugees arrived in
Austria _ the largest number per capita of the resident population
in any EU member country. Austria has a population of about 8
million.

Prince Charles offers paintings to help save child prostitutes

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles has offered limited edition prints
of one of his own watercolors to raise funds for a hostel in Nepal
which rescues girls from child prostitution, the tabloid Sun
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The prince hopes to raise more than 50,000 pounds (dlrs 82,000)
for the Maiti Nepal Hostel in Katmandu, Nepal, which he visited in
February.
	   ``This is something that he has never done before and is not
likely to be repeated,'' the Sun quoted an unnamed aide of the
prince's as saying.
	   Other watercolors by the prince, an amateur painter, have been
sold as lithographs to help raise money for his charitable trusts,
but a limited print run has never been made of one of his
watercolors, The Sun said.
	   In a personally signed letter published in The Sun, Prince
Charles told how he found the sufferings of the girls, rescued
mainly from brothels in Bombay, India after being lured there with
promises of jobs in carpet factories, ``grimmer and even more
heartbreaking than I could have imagined.''
	   He has agreed that 500 framed prints of a watercolor he painted
of a Himalayan mountain range while on a private trekking trip in
1992 can be sold as part of the appeal for funds for the hostel,
which offers a refuge for girls who have been sold into
prostitution.
	   The limited edition prints are on offer for 150 pounds (dlrs
245) each through the newspaper.

Former Beijing mayor charged with corruption, negligence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A once powerful Communist Party insider has been
charged with corruption and dereliction of duty in China's largest
graft scandal, a government official said Tuesday.
	   The charges against former Beijing party boss Chen Xitong, the
most senior official to face prosecution in a campaign to stem
government corruption, were filed in the Beijing Higher People's
Court, said a spokesman for the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the
top prosecutor's office.
	   The spokesman, who refused to give his name, said the charges
were filed by Beijing prosecutors, but would not say when. Nor
would he say when Chen would be tried.
	   Chen ruled Beijing first as mayor and then party secretary from
1987 to 1995. His downfall confirmed the suspicions of many Chinese
that corruption reaches into the highest levels of the party. But
many also believed Chen was too powerful to be put on trial.
	   Party leaders are believed to want to make an example of Chen to
ease public anger over official graft and other abuses.
	   Chen stepped down as Beijing's party secretary in 1995 after a
protege committed suicide rather than face arrest for corruption.
Chen's administration was described as a hotbed of graft, kickbacks
and misdeeds that possibly cost the city as much as 18 billion yuan
(more than dlrs 2 billion) in public funds.
	   Chen was expelled from the Communist Party last Sept. 8 and
handed over to prosecutors. Officials announced in March that
prosecutors had finished their investigations and that court
proceedings against Chen would be launched soon.

Russia's parliament weighs austerity package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hard-line parliament approved measures
Thursday that would raise taxes on a few rich Russians, but was
slow to act on the main elements of President's Boris Yeltsin's
austerity program.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders want Russia to
cut spending and improve its weak tax collection system before
releasing funds from a multi-billion-dollar loan package that was
agreed on Monday.
	   But the Communists and nationalists in parliament generally
oppose spending cuts and tax hikes, arguing that such measures will
hurt ordinary Russians.
	   By midday Thursday, parliament had approved a number of
relatively minor bills aimed mostly at the rich. The measures will
impose additional taxes on people with imported cars, mobile phones
and pagers _ a tiny fraction of the population.
	   But parliament's lower house, the State Duma, had not yet acted
on major tax reforms. Yeltsin's administration has sent more than
20 proposals to parliament, and only a few have been approved.
	   Thursday was the second and final day of a special Duma session
devoted to the government's austerity plan, and lawmakers were
expected to meet well into the evening.
	   Russia is in urgent need of cash, and the loan agreement would
bring dlrs 17.1 billion in new funds this year and next to help
stabilize financial markets that have been sinking for months.
	   The Communists are wary of the loan package, saying it could
saddle Russia with debt it cannot afford to repay. But Russia
already must pay off billions of dollars in short-term debt that
will be due in coming months, and it probably can't meet the
payments without the new loans, analysts say.
	   If parliament fails to approve the main parts of the austerity
plan, the International Monetary Fund will be in an awkward
position when its board meets Monday in Washington to review the
Russian loan deal.
	   The IMF and others do not want to release the loans until they
are convinced Russia is serious about financial reform, but the
Russian markets are likely to crash if assistance doesn't arrive
soon.
	   Yeltsin has indicated he will implement some austerity measures
by decree if the parliament does not enact them. Still, Yeltsin was
optimistic Thursday that parliament would pass the measures.
	   ``Everything is proceeding normally and I think all
(discussions) will end with positive results,'' he said.
	   Before the bills become law, they must go to parliament's upper
house, which plans to review the package Friday.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.

Meteorologists: Weather prospects remain good for Southeast Asia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's meteorologists said Thursday that a
global wet weather pattern will prevent Southeast Asia's smoky haze
from recurring this year.
	   Though Asia can still expect some hot spots and forest fires,
they will mostly be doused by heavy rains, Wong Teo Suan of the
Meteorological Service of Singapore said in a news conference.
	   The global weather phenomenon El Nino is blamed for last year's
unusually dry southwest monsoon season, which allowed fires, mostly
set by plantation owners and farmers in Indonesia, to burn out of
control, blanketing the region with smoke.
	   As El Nino is weakening, the opposite weather pattern, La Nina _
``baby girl,'' will be taking its place, bringing wet weather to
the region.
	   As a result, increased rainfall is expected in Southeast Asia
late this year and in early 1999, Wong said.

U.N.: No extension for Rwanda human rights mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Negotiations with Rwanda aimed at reinstating the
U.N. human rights mission the country suspended in May have failed
to produce agreement, the United Nations said Thursday.
	   The talks failed because Rwanda and a delegation representing
the U.N. Human Rights Field Operations in Rwanda couldn't agree on
the inclusion of human rights monitoring in the team's mandate, a
statement said.
	   ``No follow-on presence to HRFOR, which concludes its work at
the end of July, is envisaged at this time,'' said the office of
the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, which ``regrets'' the
lack of agreement.
	   The Rwandan government said in May it suspended the mission,
with some 50 staff, because of lack of coordination.
	   The government said the mandate of the mission, which was set up
following the 1994 genocide, was due for review. Rwanda wants the
mission to halt monitoring human rights abuses and devote its
efforts to educating people about human rights.
	   ``In the field operation ... the United Nations must retain the
mandate and the means to monitor the human rights situation of the
country,'' the U.N. statement said.
	   The U.N. delegation arrived in the Rwandan capital Kigali Sunday
for five days of talks, which the statement called ``respectful and
friendly.''
	   It expressed ``its sincere desire that a new cooperation
arrangement with the government of Rwanda will be established in
the near future.''
	   Rwanda's present government took control in July 1994 after
Tutsi-led rebels ousted the extremist Hutu government that had
sponsored the genocide.
	   The slaughter left more than half a million Tutsis and moderate
Hutus dead.
	   Many of the former Hutu government soldiers and militias fled
among bona-fide Hutu refugees, fearing reprisals, and returned only
in Nov. 1996.
	   Amnesty International and the U.N. human rights agency have
reported that thousands of people have since been killed in attacks
by Hutu rebels and counterattacks by the predominantly Tutsi
military.

NHL goalies falling into place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Mike Richter is back in New York. Curtis Joseph
is moving to Toronto. Felix Potvin is still with the Maple Leafs,
but for how long?
	   The NHL goalie traveling show made some stops Wednesday as the
Rangers finally settled on Richter, which sent Joseph to the Maple
Leafs and Potvin most likely out of Toronto.
	   Although no decision has been made, Toronto could trade Potvin
to Vancouver, a possible destination for Richter had he left New
York.
	   Potvin, 27, will earn dlrs 2.7 million this season and then
become a restricted free agent on July 1, 1999.
	   ``Right now, Felix is a teammate,'' said Joseph, who left
Edmonton for Toronto. ``I respect him as a goaltender. I think he's
a great guy. I'm sure things will work out for him.''
	   They certainly turned out well for the 31-year-old Ontario
native.
	   ``As a little boy I watched the Maple Leafs and dreamed about
playing for Toronto and putting the sweater on,'' Joseph said.
	   Joseph, who played his first five seasons in St. Louis, will be
the second-highest paid Leafs player behind captain Mats Sundin _
who will earn dlrs 7 million this season. Joseph was 29-31-9 with a
2.63 goals-against average in 71 regular-season games.
	   Richter, who never wanted to leave New York, re-signed with the
Rangers on Wednesday by way of the Nashville Predators.
	   ``There are a lot of opportunities, becoming a free agent,''
said Richter who signed a four-year, dlrs 21.8 million contract.
``My objective was to stay where I was happy and where I have a
chance to win a championship. That's here in New York.''
	   Richter wasn't protected by the Rangers in the June 26 expansion
draft and was selected by Nashville, but he was never going to sign
there. The deal was a formality to allow New York to protect two
goalies before next year's expansion draft, and reward the
Predators with a compensatory second-round pick.
	   Joseph, meanwhile, leaves the Oilers after three years in
Edmonton. He was spectacular in helping the Oilers to first-round
upsets against Dallas in 1996-97 and Colorado last season. He
signed for dlrs 24 million over four years after talks broke off
with the Rangers and allowed Richter back in.
	   Richter, who began his career in New York in the 1989 playoffs,
came very close on Tuesday to signing with the Florida Panthers. He
rejected at least two other offers from the Rangers before he and
general manager Neil Smith hammered out a deal.
	   Smith concurred that it was just business, and no acrimony
exists between the two sides.
	   ``Mike Richter is as dedicated a Ranger as you can get,'' Smith
said.
	   Richter, who was 21-31-15 with a 2.66 GAA last season, will turn
32 in September.
	   In other moves Wednesday, the Washington Capitals acquired
goalie Mike Rosati, a 1988 New York Rangers draft pick. He has
spent the last two seasons with the Adler Mannheim team of the
German professional league.

Museveni calls for union of eastern and central Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni has called for
a political union of eastern and central African countries to
create a medium-size power on the continent, a newspaper said
Thursday.
	   ``The Bantu-Nilotic-Sudanic people of central and eastern Africa
should form a powerful union of African states with one union
government and army,'' Museveni said in a 48-page paper presented
Wednesday to the week-long congress of his political Movement.
	   ``We should not dither. The expulison of colonization from
Africa creates the opportune moment,'' the government-owned New
Vision quoted Museveni as saying.
	   He said an army drawn from such a union would guard African
interestes against ``encroachment by foreigners.
	   Museveni, who took power in 1986 after leading a five-year
rebellion and was elected in 1996, said compared to other regions,
Africa spends to little on arms, ``yet it has the same obligations
in defending and maintaining internal peace. Is AFrica to see
defense patronage from outside?''
	   The union would initially include Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania,
Rwanda and Burundi and have a population of 92 million and a land
area of 1,822,944 sq. km. (753,177 sq. miles).
	   ``Overnight, these countries would be transformed into a medium
power in political, diplomatic, economic and military terms
comparable to Iran,'' Museveni said.
	   He said the union government would be responsible for external
defense, foreign afffairs, common markets and services and
scientific research.
	   The national governments of union members would retain
responsibility for their own internal security, roads, wildlife and
tourism, education, health, justice, mining and agriculture.
	   Museveni has repeatedly spoken in favor of regional integration
as the only way to secure economic stability.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Romanian President Emil Constantinescu joined
a tradition started by the Marquis de Lafayette in 1824 when he
addressed a joint meeting on Congress.
	   Dictators and democrats, royalty and political upstarts are
among those given the special, if not so rare, honor. They include
the world famous _ Churchill, de Gaulle and Mandela, and many like
the Romanian leader who are hardly household names in America.
	   In principle, only heads of state are allowed to address a joint
meeting of the House and Senate. Government leaders and dignitaries
such as Madame Chiang Kai-shek of China in 1943, India's Nehru in
1949 or Germany's Konrad Adenauer in 1957, have had to make two
speeches, one to the Senate and one to the House.
	   The three foreign leaders who have addressed joint meetings
during the 105th Congress that began in January 1997 _ Eduardo Frei
of Chile, Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and Constantinescu _ have all
represented nations struggling to keep their countries on the path
to more stable democracies.
	   Constantinescu's appearance Wednesday was appropriate, said
Republican Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia, one of his hosts, because
Romania ``was the only country where people actually died'' in
overthrowing communism. ``They want to be close to the United
States, they love America, and they suffered tremendously,'' Wolf
said.
	   The reasons the president of Romania was giving a speech to
Congress, and the interest of some of his hosts in promoting
Romanian membership in NATO, may have been lost on many in the
audience.
	   As often is the case when a less-than-prominent foreign figure
comes to Congress, the House chamber where joint sessions are held
was filled with young staffers and congressional pages asked to
attend so the speaker wouldn't be addressing an empty hall. A
majority of lawmakers did not attend.
	   Still, Wolf said it was a good turnout, with the leadership and
the senior members of the foreign relations committees all
attending. ``It was a very warm moment.''
	   The usual procedure is for lawmakers to ask the House speaker
and the Senate majority leader to invite a foreign leader. In this
case, Rep. Tom Bliley, also a Republican from Virginia, a
co-chairman of the House Romanian caucus, wrote House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, a Republican from Georgia, a letter saying Constantinescu
was a staunch ally of the United States and that since his election
in 1996, Romania ``has emerged out of the shadows of communism
because of his leadership and vision.''
	   Speakers at joint sessions have not always been paragons of
democracy. One-man rulers include Ethiopia's Emperor Haile Selassie
in 1954, Indonesia's Sukarno in 1956, South Vietnam's Ngo Dinh Diem
in 1957, the Shah of Iran in 1962 and the Philippines' Ferdinand
Marcos in 1966. Nicaragua's Anastasio Somoza in 1939 and Cuba's
Fulgencio Batista in 1942 also gave speeches to one or both
chambers.
	   But there have also been champions of democratic reform such as
the Philippines' Corazon Aquino in 1989, Poland's Lech Walesa in
1989, the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel in 1990 and Russia's Boris
Yeltsin in 1994.
	   Margaret Thatcher, India's Rajiv Gandhi, Queen Elizabeth, Anwar
Sadat, and Israeli leaders from Yitzhak Rabin to Shimon Peres to
Benjamin Netanyahu also have all had their chance on the dais.

Russian miners block railway, but most trains find detour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Striking coal miners in Siberia maintained their
blockade of the Trans-Siberian railway, but most trains are able to
pass by taking a lengthy detour, a report said Thursday.
	   Protesters in the mining towns of Anzhero-Sudzhensk and Yurga
said the blockade would stay in place after negotiations with
regional officials broke down Wednesday night, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   But more than 400 trains crossing Siberia have taken alternative
routes to avoid the 110-kilometer (70-mile) stretch of railway that
the miners have blocked.
	   As the strike dragged on for a 13th day Thursday, President
Boris Yeltsin ordered Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Sysuyev to meet
with the miners. The president said the Tomsk region in Siberia,
heavily affected by the blockade, was suffering ``enormous
losses.''
	   Miners are demanding Yeltsin's resignation, an overhaul of the
economy and the immediate payment of salaries that have gone unpaid
for up to six months.
	   Sysuyev, who helped resolve a similar rail blockade in May, had
said previously that the federal government would not talk with
miners until they got off the tracks.

Relieved Indonesia welcomes IMF decision to restart lending

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A relieved Indonesia on Thursday
welcomed an International Monetary Fund decision to restart lending
to it, saying the release of a dlrs 1 billion installment would
bring some relief to its battered economy.
	   Meanwhile, a new budget delivered by the government anticipates
that Indonesia will continue to wallow in recession as the economy
shrinks by 12 percent and inflation hits 66 percent in 1998.
	   Additionally, the top economics minister, Ginandjar
Kartasasmita, said Indonesia has agreed in principle with some of
its international lenders to reschedule its sovereign debt _ a
course the world's fourth most populous nation had tried to avoid
until now.
	   Ginandjar said the IMF decision to lend to his nation again
would boost the value of the sagging rupiah against the U.S. dollar
and provide badly needed foreign exchange reserves.
	   The IMF approved the release of the money in Washington
Wednesday as part of a dlrs 43 billion rescue plan.
	   It also agreed to a dlrs 1.3 billion increase in an existing
standby credit facility to Indonesia, and announced that more than
dlrs 6 billion from various official sources would be available by
the end of March 1999.
	   Indonesia's economy is suffering its worst crisis in 30 years.
It has been the hardest hit by Asia's financial meltdown.
	   The IMF and Indonesian officials agreed on a bailout program
last year. However, the plan stalled several times when the IMF
complained that then-President Suharto was not living up to
promises to reform the economy.
	   The dlrs 1 billion payment was postponed in May when political
turmoil, riots and protests forced Suharto to quit after 32 years
in power.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, restarted negotiations
with the IMF and is following through with tough reforms.
	   Speaking after a meeting with Habibie, Ginandjar said the
government is working on the details with lenders to reschedule
debt.
	   He hoped it would reach final agreement with donors at the
Consultative Group on Indonesia meeting in Paris July 19-30.
	   Ginandjar said the government still has to agree with its
biggest lender, Japan, on rescheduling debt.
	   ``Japan insists on repayment of principal loans first before it
can talk about rescheduling,'' Ginandjar said.
	   Ginandjar said the government would continue to pay interest on
its debt.
	   Indonesian government debt stood at dlrs 54.4 billion on March
31, the latest date for which figures are available.
	   Public sector debt, which groups government and state-owned
enterprises' debt, stood at dlrs 65.56 billion.

	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ About a half-kiolgram (one pound) of
explosives were discovered wired to the underside of the car of a
key foreign ministry employee, police said Thursday.
	   The explosives were found on Wednesday after Anne Orderud Paust,
private secretary to Norway's defense minister, spotted a strange
object while inspecting her car after hearing an unusual noise
while driving.
	   ``The explosives did not have a detonator. That is to say there
wasn't a detonator when we removed if from the car,'' said Morten
Yggeseth of the Oslo police.
	   News reports said neither Orderud Paust or her husband, senior
foreign ministry official Per Paust, could think of a motive for
placing the explosives.

Opposition leader Sam Rainsy thinks army will stay neutral
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG CHAM, Cambodia (AP) _ Prominent opposition candidate Sam
Rainsy said Thursday that the Cambodian army will not prop up
strongman Hun Sen should he lose upcoming elections.
	   Sam Rainsy told reporters after a campaign rally in this eastern
city that commanders who belong to Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party have told him they will carry out the orders of whatever
legal government emerges from the elections.
	   Though Hun Sen has said he would peacefully transfer power if he
loses the polls July 26, he has resorted to armed force or the
threat of it many times to stay in power more than a decade, most
notably in street battles a year ago that deposed his co-prime
minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. The Cambodian leader is also
accused of violence and intimidation of opposition figures and
stacking the election machinery in his favor.
	   ``They make people believe there will be a war if Sam Rainsy
wins the election,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``I can tell you, I have
received assurances from the CPP military and the CPP police, they
will remain neutral. They will not follow Hun Sen in any action to
make trouble.''
	   The balance of military strength has long been the source of
power in Cambodia. Sam Rainsy commands no forces, though he has
recently claimed support from an important police official, so it
is unclear how he could enforce his claim on office should he win
and Hun Sen refuses to step aside.
	   Most of the 100,000-man army is considered loyal to Hun Sen,
though the depths of its allegiance is unclear. A cohort of private
bodyguards and special troops personally loyal to him spearheaded
last year's coup, routing Ranariddh's smaller forces.
	   A few hundred soldiers still loyal to Ranariddh have observed a
cease-fire since March, enabling the prince to return home from
exile to campaign. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, a former member of the
prince's FUNCINPEC party, are considered Hun Sen's strongest
challengers.
	   Ranariddh finished atop U.N.-sponsored parliamentary elections
in 1993, but Hun Sen forced his way into a co-premiership by
threatening civil war. The new elections are his attempt to win
back international legitimacy and foreign aid lost because of the
takeover.
	   Ranariddh said Wednesday that he feared arrest if Hun Sen faces
losing power. He predicted the most dangerous period would be
between the vote and the announcement of preliminary results eight
days later.
	   Sam Rainsy said that decades of misrule, including the genocidal
Khmer Rouge regime of the late 1970s, had destroyed Cambodia's
natural wealth. Corruption has led to rampant logging that harmed
the ecosystem, leading to drought and potential food shortages.
	   World Food Program officials have predicted that 200,000 people
in eastern Cambodia could face rice shortages due to drought
worsened by the El Nino weather phenomenon. Sam Rainsy said
short-term food aid was essential, but the real issue was
deforestation.
	   ``We used to be a large exporter of rice and now we are
starving,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``Something is wrong in this
country.''

Israeli defense minister: Russia must stop aid to Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In a meeting with the head of Russia's
principal secret service, Israel's defense minister said Thursday
that Russian aid to Iran's ground-to-ground missile development
project must be ``unequivocally halted.''
	   Yitzhak Mordechai expressed Israel's concerns about Iran's
development of non-conventional weapons and missiles in a meeting
with Lt. Gen. Nikolai Kovalyov, director of Russia's Federal
Security Service, according to a statement from the Defense
Ministry.
	   Mordechai said Israel wants ``open and substantive'' relations
with Russia, but that that would be easier if Russa would halt its
aid to Iran.
	   Kovalyov, director of the Federal Security Service, is in Israel
for a one week visit, according to Israeli newspaper reports. He is
expected to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trade
and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky, as well as with his
counterparts in Israeli intelligence.
	   Israel has expressed concerns in the past about a nuclear power
plant Russia is building in Iran, saying it could help Iran advance
its suspected nuclear weapons program. Russia and Iran say the
plant will be used only for civilian purposes.
	   Russia has also denied U.S. and Israeli accusations that Russian
companies and scientists had helped Iran in its attempt to develop
a long-range missile.
	   The Federal Security Service is Russia's principal
counterintelligence and anti-terrorism agency and one of several
successors to the old Soviet KGB.

Lawmaker carried weapons into parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that lawmaker was protesting in support of bill on
Tuesday, ADDS background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ An unruly opposition lawmaker who was
thrown out of India's parliament was found to have been armed with
two knives and a gun, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Hindustan Times said doctors discovered the weapons as they
treated Anand Mohan for minor injuries he received in a scuffle
with guards as they ejected him from parliament on Tuesday. Anand
was protesting the speaker's decision not to introduce a bill that
would have set aside a third of the federal parliamentary seats for
women. The bill had been derailed by other protests.
	   The Times said the discovery was reported to the parliament
speaker, and authorities were reviewing security measures. It was
not clear whether Mohan would face censure.
	   Dozens of legislators in the parliament have links with
criminals, and some of them, including Mohan, have criminal
records. Politicians are often accused of using their powerful
positions to slow or derail cases against them.
	   Mohan, a member of the small opposition Rashtriya Janata Party,
is from the northern state of Bihar, which is plagued by violent
crime. Mohan once conducted a parliamentary campaign from prison
and went on to win. He has been linked to cases ranging from arson
to murder.
	   The issue of criminals in politics has been debated for years in
India. Before elections earlier this year, election commissioner
M.S. Gill pleaded with parties not to allow criminals to run, but
acknowledged there was little he could do to stop them.

Ukrainian parliament approves appointment of new chief prosecutor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine's parliament Thursday approved the
nomination of Mykhailo Potebenko as the country's new chief
prosecutor.
	   Verkhovna Rada voted 266-34 to approve the appointment of
Potebenko, who was nominated by President Leonid Kuchma.
	   Potebenko earlier served as chief prosecutor of the Kiev region
and since 1997 as the prosecutor general of the capital Kiev.
	   Last fall, Ukraine's previous Rada repeatedly refused to approve
another candidate nominated by Kuchma to the post, leaving it
vacant for a long period.
	   Speaking in parliament Thursday, Potebenko pledged to improve
the work of his new office, saying it had too many departments and
was overstaffed.

Two road accidents in Iran leave 42 dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two road accidents in northeastern Iran have
left 42 people dead and nine injured, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   A bus carrying villagers from Mashhad, 900 kilometers (560
miles) northeast of the capital Tehran, collided with a truck on
Monday night, the Qods paper said.
	   Twenty-three people were killed, including the truck driver and
his son who was riding with him, and four people were injured, the
newspaper reported.
	   In the second accident, a bus carrying students from the central
city of Isfahan to Mashhad hit a truck loaded with wheat on Monday
night.
	   Qods said 19 people were killed and five injured in the
collision.
	   The collisions brought the casualty toll to 70 people dead and
more than 35 injured in accidents around Mashhad during the past
week, Qods added. Thousands of people have been traveling to and
from the holy city for a summer pilgrimage.

Thai law may allow Kanchanalak to escape extradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Pauline Kanchanalak, the Thai
businesswoman charged with making illegal campaign contributions to
the U.S. Democratic National Committee, has said she will fight the
case, Thai newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Citing sources who had spoken with the 47-year-old lobbyist, the
Bangkok Post and The Nation quoted her as saying extradition
proceedings against her would not be necessary.
	   It was not clear if this meant she would go to the United States
voluntarily to face charges or if she believed the charges would be
dropped before extradition hearings could proceed. The Nation
reported she had hired a lawyer named Erik Kitchen to represent
here.
	   Kanchanalak and her sister-in-law and business associate,
Duangnet ``Georgie'' Kronenberg, 41, were charged by a U.S.
District Court in Washington with illegally funneling contributions
of at least dlrs 679,000 to the Democratic National Committee and
other political committees. Kronenberg resides in Virginia.
	   It is not clear whether the crimes with which they were charged
are covered by the extradition treaty between Thailand and the
United States. Generally an extraditable offense must be considered
a crime in both countries.
	   Thai Deputy Foreign Minister Sukhumbhand Paribatra was quoted by
The Nation as saying Thailand will consider the legal issue after
the United States makes an official extradition request.
	   Sukhumbhand said he believed Kanchanalak, whose Thai given name
is Pornpimol, is in Thailand. Local newspapers reported that until
news of the indictment was announced, she had been going to work at
the Bangkok offices of the Thai-U.S. Business council, the
organization for which she did much of her lobbying work in
Washington.
	   Efforts by The Associated Press to contact her directly have not
succeeded.
	   The 24-count indictment officially charged the pair with
conspiring to impede the Federal Election Commission and cause
false statements to be submitted to it.
	   Kanchanalak, as a Thai citizen, is barred from making financial
contributions for the nomination and election of candidates for
political office in the United States.

Rights group demands freedom for Nigerian political prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ One day after Nigeria's military
government ordered hundreds of inmates be immediately released, a
prominent human rights organization Thursday demanded freedom for
more than 400 political prisoners.
	   The government of Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar has yet to identify
the prisoners ordered released Wednesday, and it was not clear if
any had already returned home. Officials said in a statement that
those given clemency included at least 400 people convicted by
special military tribunals created by the late military ruler Gen.
Sani Abacha.
	   All were being held without trial or were behind bars despite
having completed their prison terms.
	   In announcing the releases, the government said the decision was
made to ``decongest the prisons and ... defend the freedom and
basic right of individuals.''
	   But Nigeria's Committee for the Defense of Human Rights said
there are 404 political prisoners who should be freed. Abubakar has
already freed dozens of political prisoners, and has vowed to free
the rest.
	   The rights group also called on Abubakar to repeal the state
security decree that gave Abacha and his security apparatus the
right to detain people indefinitely, saying such a move would show
``the new head of state's commitment to genuine restoration of
democracy, human rights and rule of the law.''
	   Abubakar has vowed to continue with the flawed transition
program begun by Abacha, but has said that he will move the country
toward genuine democracy.
	   He is expected to address the nation soon on his plans,
including when fresh elections will be held and when the military,
which has ruled Nigeria without interruption since Dec. 31, 1983,
will hand over power to elected rule.
	   The date of his speech has yet to be announced, though it
reportedly will be made either later Thursday or Friday.
	   Abubakar came to power in early June following the death of
Abacha, whose brutal five-year rule left the country diplomatically
isolated. Neglect and corruption also hastened the disintegration
of the country's infrastructure and economy.

Festina official suspended
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Festina official suspended; Will be
updated after day's stage about 1600 GMT
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHOLET, France (AP) _ Stuart O'Grady's short sprinting talents
helped him take over the lead of the three-week long Tour de France
on the race's longest stage.
	   But the Tour was under a growing cloud Thursday, with the
suspension of Bruno Roussel, the Festina team director, due to the
drug controversy that threatens the event.
	   The International Cycling Union announced just before the start
of the Tour's fifth stage that Roussel had failed to respond
adequately to an investigation by the French Cycling Federation.
	   It said it had suspended his cycling license, and therefore he
will not be able to work on the Tour de France.
	   Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were still in detention
Thursday in Cholet.
	   The Australian O'Grady has gained world and Olympic medals for
his powerful sprinting on a cycling track. On the 252-kilometer
(157-mile) fourth stage of the Tour Wednesday, he used that ability
to gain precius bonus seconds to gain the overall lead in the race.
	   He became the fourth different rider to lead the overall
standings in the five days of racing, counting Saturday's prologue.
	   O'Grady won a pair of intermediate sprints and came in third in
another to gain 14 extra seconds. Although he finished eight
seconds behind in the main pack, he came out ahead in the overall
standings.
	   He leads Bo Hamburger, Tuesday's leader, by 11 seconds with
George Hincapie of the United States third, also 11 seconds behind.
	   O'Grady got a bit of revenge after his GAN teammate Chris
Boardman won the prologue and had the yellow jersey for a day
before falling on Monday.
	   ``I saw the pressure that Chris was under for just six minutes
of racing. It was absolutely incredible. But then we worked for him
to hold on to the yellow jersey and I remember he came to me and
said `I wish I could do the same for you some day,' ''
	   ``For me to wear the yellow jersey is a dream come true,'' the
25-year-old O'Grady said. ``And to be only the second Australian
makes me very proud.''
	   The other Australian, Phil Anderson, wore in briefly over four
different Tours in the early 1980s.
	   O'Grady was lucky to avoid a getting caught in traffic when a
tight turn about threee kilometers (2 miles) frm the finish cut the
pack in two.
	   Jeroen Blijlevens of the Netherlands took the sprint finish over
a small group that was at at head of the pack and avoided troubel.
	   Blijlevens won the sprint for his fourth individual stage
victory. Second was Italian Nicola Minali with Czech Jan Svorada
third.
	   Most of the pack was eight seconds behind after the fall delayed
many of them.
	   But the attention Thursday was on the growing drug controversy.
	   On Wednesday, the Festina team issued a statement saying it was
Roussel's wish to be heard.
	   He got that wish later, when police offically detained him for
questioning. French law allows up to 48 hours before any further
action.
	   Last week, a Belgian masseur for Festina was arrested after
police found a large quantity of performance-enhancing drugs in his
team car.
	   According to judicial sources, after first saying the drugs were
for his personal use, the man charged said he was under team
orders.
	   Festina officials denied those accusations and said that they
had hired two lawyers to protect their image and riders.
	   Festina's main sponsor, the watch company of the same name, was
threatening to break its contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

Collymore loses sponsorship deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Sportswear company Diadora has
terminated its 2.5 million-pound (dlrs 4.1 million) sponsorship
contract with troubled Aston Villa soccer star Stan Collymore.
	   The former England international was widely condemned after
attacking his Swedish-born television presenter girlfriend Ulrika
Jonsson in a Paris bar on the eve of the opening game of the World
Cup.
	   Diadora UK released a statement Thursday saying Collymore had
not complied with certain contractual obligations and left the
company with no alternative but to terminate the deal immediately.
	   Diadora managing director Andrew Ronnie responded immediately
after the incident in Paris by saying he was ``amazed'' by
Collymore's actions.
	   ``We were very surprised by what Stan did. We pay him a
substantial amount of money,'' Ronnie said. ``He has always been
very pleasant to work with and a nice guy _ we are amazed.''
	   The Birmingham press reported huge public backlash against
Collymore after the attack on Jonsson, who immediately broke off
their relationship.
	   Collymore reported back to Aston Villa for pre-season training
last week saying he would be a hero again if he could score goals.
	   Collymore only scored eight goals last season after joining
Villa for 7 millions pounds (dlrs 11.62 million) from Liverpool in
May 1997.

Swiss banks say they're ready to resume settlement talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Two big Swiss banks said Thursday
they were ready to resume stalled talks aimed at finding an
agreement over the return of Holocaust survivors' assets.
	   Spokesmen for Credit Suisse and the newly created United Bank of
Switzerland said they would take part in negotiations with Jewish
groups and lawyers representing survivors. No date has yet been set
for the talks.
	   Talks have been stalled since Jewish leaders reacted angrily to
the offer by Credit Suisse and UBS on June 19 of dlrs 600 million
to settle Holocaust survivors' claims.
	   The banks insisted it was their final offer. But Jewish leaders
said the real value of the dormant wartime assets victims had
deposited was more than dlrs 1 billion.
	   ``We have always maintained our readiness to take part in the
negotiations,'' Credit Suisse Group spokesman Paul Rhyn said.
	   The dlrs 600 million offer is still on the table, said UBS
spokesman Christoph Meier.
	   Two attorneys for some of the survivors, Edward Fagan and Robert
A. Swift, said at a news conference on Wednesday they wanted to
settle the case as soon as possible to provide compensation for
aging survivors before they die.
	   However, another lawyer, Michael Hausfeld, said Fagan and
Swift's comments didn't apply to the bulk of survivors. He said he
believes the two attorneys may be too willing to compromise with
the banks.
	   Fagan and Swift said they were willing to be flexible and
possibly come down from the dlrs 1.5 billion they have sought from
the banks.
	   But they said the banks and the Swiss government also needed to
compromise. The government should contribute to the settlement,
they say.
	   Hausfeld said he wouldn't be taking part in the talks.
	   The survivors are taking legal action against Credit Suisse and
UBS, the product of last month's merger of Union Bank of
Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., over assets the survivors say
were looted or otherwise kept from them after World War II.
	   Also Thursday, a Jewish wartime refugee who last month had a
compensation claim to the Swiss government rejected appealed to the
country's supreme court, his lawyer said.
	   Joseph Spring claimed 100,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 69,000) because
he and two cousins were twice refused refuge by the Swiss in 1943
from the occupying Nazi regime in neighboring France.

Asian shares end mostly higher on renewed confidence over Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mostly higher
Thursday on news that a senior politician known as aggressive in
pursuing economic reforms would seek the prime minister's job in
Japan.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei average of 225 selected issues rose 117.78
points, or 0.76 percent, and closed at 16,731.92 after a
125.23-point rise Wednesday.
	   Buying was encouraged by news that former Chief Cabinet
Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama would seek to replace outgoing Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   Kajiyama was instrumental in developing recent steps to
stabilize Japan's beleaguered banking system, and has stressed in
the past that radical measures were needed to boost Japan's
stagnant economy.
	   ``The question is whether Kajiyama will actually become prime
minister,'' said Yoshio Watanabe, a derivatives manager at Toyo
Securities.
	   In late Tokyo trading, the dollar was at 139.72 yen, down 0.94
yen from late Wednesday.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed sharply higher on hopes that
foreign investors would increase stock purchases on a more stable
yen.
	   The benchmark index soared 16.93 points, or 5.4 percent, closing
at 330.35.
	   In Hong Kong, shares closed higher after the stronger yen
relieved fears of a new round of Asian currency turmoil and lifted
stock markets across the region.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
closed at 8,685.57, up 130.35 points, or 1.5 percent.
	   The index climbed gradually following the yen's strong
performance, but slight profit-taking brought down prices near the
close.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices rallied for the second day as
investors covered short positions, but dealers said continued
uncertainty on fundamentals would hold back further market gains.
The SET index gained 8.26 points, or 3.0 percent, closing at
282.01.
	   JAKARTA: The long-awaited approval of dlrs 1.3 billion from the
IMF rescue package boosted share prices in unusually active
trading. The JSX composite index was up 6.433 points, or 1.4
percent, ending at 473.772.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices ended mostly lower as persistent
fears of increasing corporate insolvencies and restructuring offset
regional confidence over Japan. The Composite Index was down 3.55
points, closing at 429.99.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed despite renewed regional
confidence over Japan's economy. Uncertainty in the local exchange
offset gains from buying of selected stocks. The PSE index of 30
selected stocks was up 2.94 points to 1,797, but the broader All
Shares Index was off 0.06 points to 560.85.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly higher, buoyed by stronger
regional currencies and optimism over Seiroku Kajiyama's bid to
become Japan's next prime minister. The Straits Times Industrial
Index gained 17.96 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at 1,070.98.
	   SYDNEY: Improving confidence in the Japanese economy pushed the
benchmark All Ordinaries Index to its highest close since early
May. The index gained 36.7 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at
2,810.6.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares closed higher after an overnight gain in
the U.S. Nasdaq Composite Index encouraged buying of
high-technology stocks. The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan
Stock Exchange gained 48.93 points, or 0.62 percent, closing at
7,924.84.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares marked their third consecutive
sessions of gains, buoyed by lower short-term interest rates. The
NZSE-40 Capital Index was up 25.73, closing at 2,131.72.

Report: Pope not welcome in Romania because of church conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Pope John Paul II may not be welcome
in Romania because of a conflict between Eastern Rite Catholics and
the majority Orthodox Church over church property, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile recently invited the pope when he was
visiting the Vatican. The invitation reportedly had the oral
blessing of Patriarch Teoctist, the head of the Orthodox Church.
	   The Orthodox Church press office declined to comment Thursday,
and government spokesman Tudor Anghel called the church's apparent
change of mind ``speculation.''
	   However, daily Libertatea reported the Holy Synod decided
Wednesday not to invite the pontiff until ``divergencies'' were
resolved between the two churches.
	   A visit by the pope in Transylvania, where most Eastern Rite
Catholics live, ``would be seen as a threat by the Orthodox
faithful that they would lose their churches,'' said Liviu Stoinea,
a professor at the Orthodox theology institute, as quoted by
Libertatea. Catholics make up only five percent of the population.
	   The Communists seized Catholic properties in 1948 and handed
them to the Orthodox Church. Tensions over who owns the buildings
have erupted between the two, culminating in a recent cathedral
brawl in the Transylvanian city of Cluj.
	   After a lengthy trial, Eastern Rite Catholics, who are beholden
to the Vatican, were handed back a cathedral. The Orthodox, who
account for 90 percent of all Romanians, eventually agreed to
relinquish the cathedral. The Orthodox have their center in
Istanbul.

<TEXT>
	   CHOLET, France (AP) _ The cloud over the Tour de France was
growing quickly Thursday with the suspension of Festina team
director Bruno Roussel due to a growing drug controversy.
	   The International Cycling Union announced Thursday morning, just
before the start of the Tour's fifth stage, that Roussel had failed
to respond adequately to an investigation from the French Cycling
Federation.
	   It said it had suspended his cycling license, and therefore he
will not be able to work on the Tour de France.
	   But Jean-Marie LeBlanc, the Tour de France director, said there
was no reason to suspend the team from competing for the moment.
The police conducted a search of the riders' rooms on Wednesday.
	   Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were still in detention in
Cholet, after being taken in for questioning by police following
Wednesday's stage.
	   Police from the northern city of Lille came down to conduct the
investigation. That's where a Belgian member of the Festina team
has been under arrest since last week, when he was found with a
stash of performance-enhancing drugs in a team car.
	   The scandal was on the front page of virtually all French
newspapers Thursday.
	   ``The Tour is Derailed,'' headlined the Liberation daily.
``Police at the Finish Line,'' said Le Parisien. ``It's Going
Badly,'' said France-Soir. ``The Tour Poisoned,'' said Le Figaro.
	   The Festina team issued a statement Wednesday saying Roussel
wished to be heard.
	   He got his wish later, when police offically detained him.
French law allows detention of up to 48 hours before further
action.
	   Festina's main sponsors, the Spanish watch company Festina, are
threatening to break their contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

Floods inundate parts of a town; death toll rises to 38

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ An overflowing river inundated parts of
a northern town as Bangladesh's week-long floods marooned tens of
thousands of people and the death toll rose to at least 38,
officials said Thursday.
	   Nearly half of Gaibandha, a town of 100,000 residents located
190 kilometers (120 miles) north of the capital Dhaka, is under
knee-high water, an aide to the area's government administrator
said in a telephone interview.
	   The aide, speaking on customary condition of anonymity, said at
least 10,000 people had fled their homes to take shelter in school
buildings on high ground.
	   Some residents were using boats to commute to work, said Ahmed
Ali, a businessman in the town on the bank of the Teesta river, a
tributary of the Brahmaputra.
	   Twenty-seven of the country's 64 districts have been flooded by
the rain-swollen Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna rivers. The three
rivers are the largest in this South Asian delta nation of 120
million and feed hundreds of smaller rivers and streams.
	   The floods have affected at least 3 million people who have
either been trapped in their villages or lost houses and rice
crops, according to Dhaka's Flood Information Center.
	   Officials and newspapers said Thursday that 16 more people,
including six children, drowned in swirling waters in the districts
of Gaibandha, Bogra, Kurigram and Pabna to the north and Daudkandi
and Narayanganj to the east. Those casualties raised the overall
death toll to 38.
	   A shortage of boats is hampering deliveries of rice, bread and
medicines to flood victims, the government's Relief Ministry said.
In some areas villagers are felling banana trees to make rafts,
news reports said.
	   Low-lying Bangladesh is hit every year by floods and cyclones
that kill hundreds of people.

Israeli businessman sentenced to 16 years for sales to Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a high-profile treason case tinged
with scandal, an Israeli businessman was sentenced to 16 years in
prison on Thursday for selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   Judge Amnon Straschnov said the defendant, former paratrooper
Nachum Manbar, sacrificed Israel's security ``on the altar of
unfettered greed.'' Iran is one of Israel's most implacable foes.
	   Manbar, who faced life in prison, sat stone-faced as he heard
the decision. When he was walked out of Tel Aviv District Court,
Manbar shouted: ``There will be an appeal.''
	   Earlier this week, Manbar's lead defense attorney, Amnon
Zichroni, had alleged that Straschnov had secretly maintained a
``close, intensive'' relationship with Pninat Yanai, a female
member of the defense team who was eventually fired.
	   Straschnov has denied the allegations and rejected defense
demands that he withdraw from the case before passing sentence.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Manbar's conviction and sentence.
Despite his earlier charges against the judge, Zichroni was evasive
Thursday when asked whether he would make alleged improper judicial
conduct a key element of his appeal.
	   The story has dominated Israeli media since it broke Tuesday,
and at certain points also took on a political tinge.
	   It began with a legislator from the opposition Labor Party,
Nissim Zvili, calling for an investigation of allegations that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the case with
Straschnov and tried to influence him. Zvili has since withdrawn
the demand, saying he accepted the judge's denial. Netanyahu has
also denied having had any contact with Straschnov.
	   On Thursday, the Haaretz daily quoted Netanyahu as saying
privately that his predecessors, Labor prime ministers Shimon Peres
and Yitzhak Rabin, had turned a blind eye to Manbar's activities
because of Manbar's ties to the Labor Party.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday denied having made such accusations and
said in a statement he found no fault with his predecessors'
behavior in the Manbar case.
	   Yossi Melman, a journalist who covers the intelligence services
for the Haaretz daily, said Manbar started out selling defensive
equipment, such as gas masks and gas detectors, to Iran with the
knowledge of the Israeli defense establishment in the early 1990s.
	   However, at some point Manbar allegedly began selling chemicals
that can be used both in agriculture and in making poison gas,
Melman said. Manbar was warned by Israeli intelligence in late 1993
to stop those sales, Melman said.
	   Manbar was not alone in selling to Iran, Melman said. In the
early 1990s, Israeli companies sold mortar shells and fertilizer
with the knowledge of the security establishment, he said.
	   A change came in 1994, when Mossad chief Shabtai Shavit said
Iran should be perceived as a strategic threat to Israel and urged
the government to change its policy accordingly, Melman said.
	   Straschnov on Thursday made a reference to the permissive
atmosphere at the time. The defense has said Manbar was not alone
in selling to Iran, and that he did not supply offensive materials.
	   ``We cannot ignore the arguments of the defense, which were
heard behind closed doors,'' Straschnov said. ``We believe that
even if we are just talking about a few cases that were not similar
to this one ... they still had considerable weight in not imposing
the maximum sentence,'' he said.

Turkey launches study for fresh water pipeline to northern Cyprus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ While final preparations are under way for
the shipment of water in bags to the breakaway Turkish Cypriot
state, Turkey has also launched a study to build a fresh water
pipeline to the Mediterranean island.
	   The pipeline, expected to be built 60 to 70 meters (198 to 231
feet) below the sea, would alleviate the severe shortage in the
self-declared republic, Dogan Altinbilek, head of the state water
works, told the Anatolia news agency Thursday.
	   President Suleyman Demirel is scheduled to attend the
inauguration ceremony on July 25 for the shipment of fresh water
from Turkey's Soguksu River to the island in a 10,000-cubic meter
(350,000 cubic foot) water bag, dragged by a ship. Turkey hopes to
ship a total of 7 million cubic meters (245 million cubic feet) per
year in water bags.
	   But a pipeline was needed in order to answer the longer term
water demands of northern Cyprus' estimated 200,000 population,
Altinbilek said. The pipeline would be built at an estimated cost
of dlrs 160 million.
	   ``I hope that this project will be brought to life in a very
short time,'' the agency quoted him as saying.
	   Meanwhile, a first water bag left Turkey's Mediterranean coastal
town of Aydincik for northern Cyprus on a trial run, the Hurriyet
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The Turkish Cypriot state established in the northern third of
the island is only recognized by Turkey. Cyprus remains divided
since 1974 when Turkey sent in troops in the wake of a short-lived
coup backed by Athens.

Siemens posts disappointing profits, weighs emergency moves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Siemens AG, the German electronics and
electrical engineering giant, said Thursday it has failed to meet
earnings goals and is seeking ways to improve its performance.
	   A sharp drop in memory chip prices has caused major losses in
the semiconductor business, one of four troubled Siemens divisions,
company chairman Heinrich von Pierer said.
	   Group profits for the first nine months of Siemens' fiscal year,
ending June 30, edged up to 1.78 billion marks (dlrs 996 million)
from 1.71 billion marks (dlrs 958 million) in the same 1997 period.
	   ``We can't be content with this,'' von Pierer told a news
conference in The Hague, Netherlands.
	   Siemens is introducing a 10-point plan to improve the situation,
he said. Possibilities include selling off loss-making units and
separating the accounts of individual business sectors, the company
said.
	   Sales in the first nine months ending June 30 rose to 81.9
billion marks (dlrs 45.9 billion), up from 71.2 billion marks (dlrs
39.9 billion) in the year-earlier period. Incoming orders rose to
87.6 billion marks from 82.8 billion marks.
	   Siemens' problem sectors represent one-third of global sales.
Apart from semiconductors, Pierer said the power generation group
KWU, private communications systems and transportation systems were
struggling.
	   Last year's sharp price erosion in memory chips and an extreme
drop in prices in recent weeks mean ``the semiconductors group will
show a high loss'' in the financial year ending Sept. 31, Pierer
said.
	   Siemens is expecting a loss of more than 1 billion marks (dlrs
560 million) in that sector, compared with net profit of 109
million marks (dlrs 61 million) last year.

Asian shares end mostly higher on renewed confidence over Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS that Kajiyama has not confirmed he's seeking post, 3rd
graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mostly higher
Thursday on news that a senior politician known as aggressive in
pursuing economic reforms would seek the prime minister's job in
Japan.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei average of 225 selected issues rose 117.78
points, or 0.76 percent, and closed at 16,731.92 after a
125.23-point rise Wednesday.
	   Buying was encouraged by a report by the Japanese agency Kyodo
News that former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama would
seek to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
Kajiyama's aides refused to confirm that report, but said an
announcement would likely be made soon.
	   Kajiyama was instrumental in developing recent steps to
stabilize Japan's beleaguered banking system, and has stressed in
the past that radical measures were needed to boost Japan's
stagnant economy.
	   ``The question is whether Kajiyama will actually become prime
minister,'' said Yoshio Watanabe, a derivatives manager at Toyo
Securities.
	   In late Tokyo trading, the dollar was at 139.72 yen, down 0.94
yen from late Wednesday.
	   In Seoul, share prices closed sharply higher on hopes that
foreign investors would increase stock purchases on a more stable
yen.
	   The benchmark index soared 16.93 points, or 5.4 percent, closing
at 330.35.
	   In Hong Kong, shares closed higher after the stronger yen
relieved fears of a new round of Asian currency turmoil and lifted
stock markets across the region.
	   The Hang Seng Index, the market's key indicator of blue chips,
closed at 8,685.57, up 130.35 points, or 1.5 percent.
	   The index climbed gradually following the yen's strong
performance, but slight profit-taking brought down prices near the
close.
	   Elsewhere:
	   BANGKOK: Thai stock prices rallied for the second day as
investors covered short positions, but dealers said continued
uncertainty on fundamentals would hold back further market gains.
The SET index gained 8.26 points, or 3.0 percent, closing at
282.01.
	   JAKARTA: The long-awaited approval of dlrs 1.3 billion from the
IMF rescue package boosted share prices in unusually active
trading. The JSX composite index was up 6.433 points, or 1.4
percent, ending at 473.772.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Share prices ended mostly lower as persistent
fears of increasing corporate insolvencies and restructuring offset
regional confidence over Japan. The Composite Index was down 3.55
points, closing at 429.99.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed mixed despite renewed regional
confidence over Japan's economy. Uncertainty in the local exchange
offset gains from buying of selected stocks. The PSE index of 30
selected stocks was up 2.94 points to 1,797, but the broader All
Shares Index was off 0.06 points to 560.85.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed mostly higher, buoyed by stronger
regional currencies and optimism over Seiroku Kajiyama's bid to
become Japan's next prime minister. The Straits Times Industrial
Index gained 17.96 points, or 1.7 percent, closing at 1,070.98.
	   SYDNEY: Improving confidence in the Japanese economy pushed the
benchmark All Ordinaries Index to its highest close since early
May. The index gained 36.7 points, or 1.3 percent, closing at
2,810.6.
	   TAIPEI: Taiwan shares closed higher after an overnight gain in
the U.S. Nasdaq Composite Index encouraged buying of
high-technology stocks. The Weighted Price Index of the Taiwan
Stock Exchange gained 48.93 points, or 0.62 percent, closing at
7,924.84.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares marked their third consecutive
sessions of gains, buoyed by lower short-term interest rates. The
NZSE-40 Capital Index was up 25.73, closing at 2,131.72.

New massacre leaves 13 dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ The latest massacre in Algeria has left
13 people dead, Algerian security forces announced Thursday.
	   The overnight massacre took place in Tiaret, about 300
kilometers (190 miles) southwest of the capital.
	   The statement by security forces gave no further details, but
Algerian radio said the army immediately launched a search
operation.
	   The army-backed government has been fighting an Islamic
insurgency since 1992 that has left an estimated 75,000 people
dead, mostly in bombings and massacres.

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets closed mostly higher
Thursday on news that a senior politician known as aggressive in
pursuing economic reforms would seek the prime minister's job in
Japan. Tokyo's Nikkei average of 225 selected issues rose 117.78
points, or 0.76 percent, and closed at 16,731.92 after a
125.23-point rise Wednesday. Buying was encouraged by a report by
the Japanese agency Kyodo News that former Chief Cabinet Secretary
Seiroku Kajiyama would seek to replace outgoing Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto. Kajiyama's aides refused to confirm that report,
but said an announcement would likely be made soon. Kajiyama was
instrumental in developing recent steps to stabilize Japan's
beleaguered banking system, and has stressed in the past that
radical measures were needed to boost Japan's stagnant economy.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hard-line parliament approved measures
Thursday that would raise taxes on a few rich Russians, but was
slow to act on the main elements of President's Boris Yeltsin's
austerity program. The International Monetary Fund and other
lenders want Russia to cut spending and improve its weak tax
collection system before releasing funds from a
multi-billion-dollar loan package that was agreed on Monday. But
the Communists and nationalists in parliament generally oppose
spending cuts and tax hikes, arguing that such measures will hurt
ordinary Russians. By midday Thursday, parliament had approved a
number of relatively minor bills aimed mostly at the rich. The
measures will impose additional taxes on people with imported cars,
mobile phones and pagers _ a tiny fraction of the population.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The World Bank is opening its books to outside
auditors after an internal investigation uncovered possible
kickbacks and embezzlements, bank officials say. Bank President
James Wolfensohn said in a message to his 8,600-member headquarters
staff Thursday that if the lending institution campaigns against
corruption in borrowing countries then it has to have high internal
standards. He said he has set up a special fraud team and hired two
global accounting firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte
Touche, to look into the dlrs 28.6 billion in loans the 181-nation
organization makes annually for development projects around the
world. ``I am in constant personal contact with the group,''
Wolfensohn said in his statement, which the bank's chief spokesman,
Klas Bergman, made available early Thursday. One phase of the
investigation involves a civil lawsuit in federal district court
against a former bank official, Fritz Rodriguez. The bank believes
he took kickbacks from a contractor on a dlrs 435,000 water project
in Algeria. Rodriguez has denied the bank's allegations.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A relieved Indonesia on Thursday
welcomed an International Monetary Fund decision to restart lending
to it, saying the release of a dlrs 1 billion installment would
bring some relief to its battered economy. Meanwhile, a new budget
delivered by the government anticipates that Indonesia will
continue to wallow in recession as the economy shrinks by 12
percent and inflation hits 66 percent in 1998. Additionally, the
top economics minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, said Indonesia has
agreed in principle with some of its international lenders to
reschedule its sovereign debt _ a course the world's fourth most
populous nation had tried to avoid until now. Ginandjar said the
IMF decision to lend to his nation again would boost the value of
the sagging rupiah against the U.S. dollar and provide badly needed
foreign exchange reserves. The IMF approved the release of the
money in Washington Wednesday as part of a dlrs 43 billion rescue
plan. (INDONESIA-IMF)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton could lift economic
sanctions against India and Pakistan for one year under legislation
approved by a Senate mindful of the harm they cause to U.S. farms
and businesses. In another vote Wednesday night, senators approved
exemptions from all current or former U.S. unilateral sanctions for
food, medicine and medical equipment _ except for a handful of
terrorist or totalitarian countries. Both actions came during
consideration of the annual agriculture spending bill, which would
have to be reconciled with the House version before the sanctions
actions could become law. On a voice vote, the Senate approved
legislation by Kansas Republican Sens. Pat Roberts and Sam
Brownback allowing Clinton to temporarily waive for up to 12 months
the nonmilitary sanctions imposed by law after the two South Asian
countries conducted nuclear tests in May. (US-NUCLEAR SANCTIONS)

Korean auto and other workers end strike
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with end of all strikes &QL;

 &UR; By KYONG-HWA SEOK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Tens of thousands of striking auto,
telephone and banking workers returned to work Thursday, ending a
three-day strike called to protest waves of mass layoffs.
	   The nationwide walkout, called by the nation's two major
umbrella labor groups, lost momentum after striking Hyundai Motors
Co. workers abruptly halted their protest at the start of the day.
	   Other striking workers in shipbuilding, the telephone company
and banking, following organizers' instructions, continued their
strike until late in the afternoon, as scheduled.
	   But one Labor Ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said, ``After Hyundai workers pulled out, the strike
rapidly fizzled out. At many work sites, only union leaders walked
out.''
	   The Hyundai workers had said they would strike indefinitely,
while the other protest strikes had been scheduled to last just
three days, starting Tuesday.
	   Organizers denied any internal discord, but admitted that
Hyundai's decision dissipated the focus of the strike. They said
they would call a new round of strikes next week to display
solidarity.
	   ``Our members, including Hyundai workers, are ready to begin
another strike next week unless our fair demand is accepted,'' said
Chung Sung-hee, a spokesman for the militant Confederation of Koran
Trade Unions.
	   Leaders of the 26,000-member union of Hyundai Motors, by far the
dominant force in a recent series of labor protests, said they
decided to end the strike early to encourage negotiations with
management.
	   ``Now that we have taken a flexible stand, we expect that
management will be flexible, too,'' Kim Yun-ho, a union leader,
said.
	   Management at Hyundai, the nation's largest automaker, said the
union's decision to halt the protest would not affect its plan to
trim its work force by 4,800 in the coming month. Hyundai already
has laid off 5,000 employees.
	   Organizers said about 70,000 workers nationwide took part in
Thursday's strike. But the government said fewer than 5,000 joined.
	   At the national phone carrier Korea Telecom, fewer than
one-tenth of its 50,000 unionized workers responded to the strike
call, the Labor Ministry official said.
	   Other state-run companies reported normal operations.
	   Armed with court-issued warrants, police sought to arrest 85
union leaders on charges of organizing illegal strikes. Many of the
wanted men took refuge in a Roman Catholic cathedral in central
Seoul, a traditional haven for political dissidents and striking
workers.
	   A flexible labor market is a key condition of a record dlrs 58
billion bailout of the battered South Korean economy by the
International Monetary Fund in December.
	   Thousands of financially shaky companies have since collapsed,
driving nearly 1.5 million people out of their jobs. By year's end,
the number of jobless people is expected to reach 2 million in a
nation of 42 million.
	   Government officials have consistently warned that recurring
labor unrest would chase away potential foreign investment _ a key
to reviving the shattered South Korean economy.

First train in six years carries coal to Croatia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZIVINICE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ After six years, the first
train carrying coal left northern Bosnia Thursday for neighboring
Croatia.
	   Rail traffic throughout Bosnia stopped after war broke out in
1992. When it was over in 1995, tracks were destroyed and unusable.
	   Resumption of rail transport between Bosnia and neighboring
countries is expected to boost the economy and create new jobs in
the region.
	   In prewar Bosnia, coal mines in the Tuzla region produced about
10 million metric tons a year of lignite and brown coal. The coal
was burned in a nearby power plant, but also was used across former
Yugoslavia.
	   Lignite in particular was popular due to its thermal qualities
and the fact that it polluted the environment less than the other
coal.
	   These mines employed more than 10,000 workers, but after the war
less than half of the prewar employees resumed work.
	   Political difficulties also stalled rail traffic.
	   Trains did not run between towns controlled by different ethnic
groups, but the conciliatory attitude of the new Bosnian Serb
government and strong pressure from western countries who have
invested dlrs 14.7 million into railroad repairs resulted in trains
to get going again.
	   The first train carrying coal used for the first time a route
through the northern town of Brcko. It had been used since last
spring only by the NATO-led peace force for transportation of
troops and equipment.

More graves desecrated at Jewish cemetery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Unknown vandals desecrated 30 graves in the Jewish
section of Moscow's Vostryakovo cemetery, a news agency reported
Thursday.
	   A cemetery worker told police that an unidentified group of
people defiled the Jewsih graves on Wednesday night. Eight
tombstones were damaged beyond repair, the Interfax news agency
said.
	   Police have opened an investigation.
	   The desecration followed similar acts of vandalism two weeks ago
at a Jewish cemetery maintained by the Marina Roshcha synagogue,
which itself has been attacked and bombed periodically in recent
years.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The bones of Russia's last czar
were flown Thursday to the country's old imperial capital and
readied for burial, 80 years after the monarch was forced into
Siberian exile and executed.
	   The burial of Nicholas II and his family, set for Friday, was
intended as a healing gesture and an act of repentance for the
abuses of the communist era. But it's been mired in controversy as
politicians and religious leaders argued over how to handle the
service.
	   In a surprise development Thursday, President Boris Yeltsin
changed his mind and announced he would attend Friday's service.
The president had been planning to skip the ceremony because it had
become so contentious.
	   ``The truth (about the executions) was concealed for 80 years,''
Yeltsin said. ``I was told nothing. And tomorrow, the truth should
be told, and I should take part.''
	   Nicholas abdicated in 1917 amid rising political tensions, and
spent the next several months at a palace just outside St.
Petersburg. But the Bolsheviks then sent him to Siberia and
executed him and his family on July 17, 1918 _ 80 years ago Friday.
	   Their bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg and remained there until
they were unearthed in 1991.
	   Before being flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday, the bones,
sealed inside nine small coffins, were taken from a morgue to a
hilltop church in Yekaterinburg for a three-hour public service.
	   Hundreds of Russians knelt to pray, and some wept, as they
viewed coffins at the Ascension of the Lord Church.
	   ``I have come to pay a last tribute to the innocent victims,''
said a tearful Vera Kolchina, 74. ``Their deaths were a tragic part
of our history.''
	   Russians have decidedly mixed feelings about the last czar. Some
view him as a despot, others consider him a martyr, and there are
those who believe he was simply a weak, indecisive ruler
overwhelmed by the tides of history.
	   ``I have come here because it is a historical event and I wanted
my daughter to see it, so she could tell her children about it,''
said Galina Feoktistova, accompanied by her 10-year-old daughter
Yulia.
	   ``I feel pity for the czar, as for any man who died so
tragically,'' she said. But, she added, ``I don't want the monarchy
restored.''
	   About 1,000 people visited the church, which was just up the
hill from the house where Nicholas and his family were executed.
The infamous house was torn down two decades ago under the
supervision of the local Communist Party boss at the time _
Yeltsin.
	   Immediately following the church service, an honor guard carried
the coffins out of the church and they were flown to St. Petersburg
on an Aeroflot cargo jet.
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, three of their
five children and four servants.
	   The coffins of the czar and czarina are draped with the yellow
flag of the Romanov family.
	   The other two children, the only son Alexei and a daughter the
scientists believe is Maria, were executed along with the entire
family. But their remains have not been found and most
investigators believe the bodies were burned to ashes.
	   There's long been a myth that one daughter, Anastasia, survived
the shooting and escaped. But scientific tests indicate her bones
are among the remains and those of her sister Maria are missing.
	   Extensive DNA testing in the United States, Britain and Russia
convinced scientists of the authenticity of the remains. But the
Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept the results, and top
church officials were not at the services, though local priests
were officiating.

Georgians take over control of Abkhazia border from Russians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian border guards will replace
Russian troops patrolling the sea borders of breakaway Abkhazia, a
Georgian general said Wednesday.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwestern Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   The guard changeover, scheduled for Wednesday night, is part of
a 1994 agreement with Russia under which Russian troops have
patrolled Georgia's Black Sea borders, including the stretch
claimed by Abkhazia.
	   Russia has trained Georgia's border guards so that they could
eventually take over, Major Gen. Valery Chkheidze told national
television.
	   Leaders in Abkhazia oppose the switch, which they say will
strengthen Georgian control over the region and will intensify
their conflict with Georgia. They demand full control over the
border.
	   Georgian president Eduard Shevarnadze defended the decision on
Monday. ``The country that does not control its borders is an
inferior country,'' he said in a weekly radio address.
	   He said Abkhazia ``must understand that in the question of
borders Georgia acts on the basis of international conventions,
which are obligatory for all countries.''
	   Georgia and Abkhazia will continue consulting on the issue,
Chkheidze said. ``We are against any confrontation or greater
tension in the situation,'' he said.

Jane's: U.S. and India discussing test ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Senior Indian and U.S. officials discussed
conditions under which New Delhi might sign the nuclear test ban
treaty at a meeting last week, Jane's Defense Weekly reported.
	   No details were released about the July 9 meeting between Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and his counterpart from India,
Jaswant Singh, in Frankfurt, Germany. The two also met in
Washington last month.
	   The U.S. government cut off aid and loans to India after its
nuclear tests in May and called on New Delhi to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Other countries also criticized the
tests and imposed sanctions.
	   According to Jane's, Singh was told at the Washington meeting
that India could hope for no concessions from the United States
until it signed the treaty unconditionally and until it froze its
nuclear weapons program.
	   The Indian minister was also told that New Delhi's stance on
having a ``minimum nuclear deterrence'' against China was
unacceptable, the respected military magazine said in its July 15
issue.
	   Talks on conditions under which India would sign the ban
continued in Germany, and the two countries will hold further
discussions when Talbot visits New Delhi on July 20-21, Jane's
said.
	   The outcome of the talks could affect whether U.S. President
Bill Clinton will go through with a visit to India, tentatively set
for November.
	   Indian politicians have long criticized the test ban treaty,
charging that it freezes the technical advantage decades of testing
has given the traditional nuclear powers _ the United States,
Russia, China, France and Britain.
	   But India's Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said after the
tests that he would consider signing some form of the treaty, which
many arms control experts see as a first step toward eliminating
all nuclear weapons.
	   India wants to be accepted as a nuclear weapon state. Indian
officials have also said the country will not stop or slow down its
nuclear weapons and missiles programs, Jane's said.
	   Before agreeing to sign the test ban treaty, India also wants
the Western embargo on sophisticated dual-use technologies imposed
after its first nuclear test in 1974 to be lifted, the magazine
said.

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ The Defense Ministry fired three navy
and army commanders Thursday, holding them responsible for Sunday's
alleged North Korean spy incursion into South Korea.
	   The ministry also reprimanded two three-star generals for what
it said was their failure to properly conduct the search for two
supposed communist intruders.
	   The search, involving thousands of soldiers and police, was in
its fifth fruitless day Thursday in the rugged mountains of the
east coast.
	   A navy rear admiral, an army major general and an army brigadier
general in charge of defending the east coast were relieved of
their posts. Their replacements were not immediately announced.
	   The sacking came one day after President Kim Dae-jung had
scolded the military for failing to stop the alleged North Korean
infiltration, the second reported in the area in less than a month.
	   The two men being sought are believed to be the companions of a
suspected North Korean agent whose body was found washed ashore
Sunday near a major naval base at Donghae, 195 kilometers (117
miles) east of Seoul.
	   Found with and near the wet suit-clad body were a Czech-made
machine gun, a hand grenade, a portable oxygen tank and a
torpedo-shaped underwater propulsion device capable of carrying up
to five scuba divers.
	   North Korea has denied the incident as a South Korean
fabrication.
	   Discovery of the body came only three weeks after a small North
Korean submarine was found entangled in a fishing net off the east
coast.
	   Nine bodies were found in the Yugo-class sub, all shot to death
in what military investigators described as a murder-suicide
committed by senior officers to avoid capture.
	   At the border village of Panmunjom, the American-led U.N.
Command filed a formal protest with North Korea over the alleged
infiltrations Thursday, calling them ``grave'' armistice
violations.
	   Lt. Gen. Ri Chan Bok, the chief North Korean delegate,
``criticized the United States and South Korea for trying to brand
the wrecked submarine as `intruder' and conducting another
anti-North Korean smear campaign with a dead body,'' the North's
official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   North Korea demanded an apology from Washington and Seoul,
saying, ``The crewmen had no alternative but to kill themselves,
unable to transmit SOS,'' when their sub went adrift with engine
trouble and South Korean warships and aircraft attacked it and
broke its aerial.
	   With no peace treaty signed at the end of the 1950-53 Korean
War, the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Their border
is the world's most heavily guarded, with nearly 2 million troops
deployed on both sides.

Court rejects motion accusing judges in Berlin disco bombing case
</HEADLINE>
of bias &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A court Thursday rejected a prosecution motion
accusing the judges of bias in the trial of five people accused in
the 1986 disco bombing in Berlin that killed three people,
including two U.S. servicemen.
	   Prosecutors filed the motion after the trial judges ruled last
week that the alleged confession from the state's star witness
would not be considered as evidence. The court said prosecutors had
made false promises of a reduced sentence in order to secure the
confession.
	   The witness, Musbah Abulghasem Eter, who worked at the time in
the Libyan Embassy in then-communist East Berlin, was supposed to
testify against the other suspects and implicate Libya. But on the
stand in December he denied ever confessing and said his statements
in 1996 to prosecutors had been poorly translated or misunderstood.
	   The United States has accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of
ordering the bombing at the La Belle disco, killing two U.S.
servicemen and a Turkish woman and wounding 230 people.
Then-President Reagan retaliated with deadly airstrikes on two
Libyan cities.
	   Eter, 41, has been on trial for eight months along with two
other employees of Libya's former embassy in East Berlin and two
German women.
	   Prosecutor Detlev Mehlis admits he told Eter that a confession
generally leads to a lighter sentence, but said he stressed the
decision lay with the court, and denied he was trying to persuade
Eter to talk.
	   His motion accusing the judges of bias could have led to a
mistrial being declared. But a separate court ruled Thursday that
the decision to exclude Eter's statements was not evidence of bias
by the trial judges.
	   Mehlis has filed another motion seeking to get the exclusion
ruling overturned.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A U.N. envoy discussed the conflict in
East Timor with Indonesia's foreign minister Thursday amid fresh
hopes for a solution after more than two decades of bloodshed in
the disputed territory.
	   Democratic change in the wake of the May resignation of
authoritarian President Suharto has pushed negotiations forward
after many years of paralysis.
	   ``We have a chance, a good chance, at arriving at a solution,''
said Jamsheed Marker, a U.N. official who has been brokering talks
over the future of the troubled former Portuguese colony. Many East
Timorese want independence from Indonesia.
	   Marker spoke after meeting Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas. During his weeklong trip, Marker is also expected to see
President B.J. Habibie as well as East Timor's jailed separatist
rebel leader, Xanana Gusmao.
	   Marker said discussions were under way about a planned visit to
East Timor.
	   The Indonesian government as well as the territory's Roman
Catholic bishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Carlos Belo, have
warned him not to go at this time. Both fear violent demonstrations
could erupt if Marker travels there.
	   During Marker's last visit in March 1997, Indonesian soldiers
killed two pro-independence protesters.
	   Last month, security forces killed another two activists in East
Timor during protests held to impress three visiting European
ambassadors.
	   Rival groups, for or against Indonesian rule, have clashed and
thousands of people have left the territory in the past few weeks,
fearing that the violence might escalate.
	   Tensions have also heightened ahead of the 22nd anniversary
Friday of Indonesia's annexation of the territory. Soldiers
patrolled on some streets Thursday in Dili, the East Timorese
capital.
	   Marker appealed for calm in East Timor, which has endured
guerrilla war and human rights abuses since 1975, when it was
invaded by Indonesia.
	   ``There is a genuine dialogue which is going on now,'' he said.
``This dialogue should be permitted to take place in a calm
atmosphere.''
	   Still, animosity remains evident.
	   At a seminar Thursday in Jakarta, Belo accused Indonesians of
raping women in East Timor over the last two decades.
	   And Jose Ramos-Horta, co-winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize
with Belo, said violence around the anniversary date of Indonesia's
annexation was ``almost inevitable.''
	   Suharto ordered the invasion of East Timor and the 1976
annexation and later steadfastly refused to make compromises.
Habibie came to power in May after Suharto quit, ending 32 years of
authoritarian rule.
	   Habibie recently offered to release Gusmao and to grant some
autonomy to East Timor in return for international recognition that
it is an integral part of Indonesia.
	   The United Nations and many governments do not recognize
Indonesia's territorial claim.
	   Marker said he hoped to convene a meeting soon between the
foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal along with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

Italy goes up against Black brothers

<TEXT>
	   PRATO, Italy (AP) _ Italy, banking on the surprising Davide
Sanguinetti, goes up against the Black brothers of Zimbabwe in a
Davis Cup quarterfinal tie on clay in this Tuscan city.
	   Italy's top-ranked player Andrew Gaudenzi was drawn Thursday to
meet Wayne Black in Friday's opening singles. Sanguinetti, ranked
No. 56 in the world but a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon, will follow
against Byron Black.
	   In Saturday's doubles, Gaudenzi will team with Diego Nargiso
against the Black brothers.
	   Zimbabwe advanced with an upset victory over Australia while
Italy eliminated India.
	   Italy has had few top-ranked players over the years, but has
done well in Davis Cup play. Against Zimbabwe, it is seeking to
reach its third consecutive semifinal.

Assembly enlarged as part of agreement on transitional government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ The National Assembly was enlarged
Thursday from 81 to 121 seats as part of an agreement on a process
to restore representative government in Burundi.
	   The announcement by the Constitutional Court came three days
before the government, political parties and rebel representatives
were to return to Arusha, Tanzania, Monday for a second round of
all-party peace talks.
	   The predominantly Hutu party Frodebu now holds 65 seats in the
National Assembly to 16 for the mainly Tutsi Uprona party as a
result of elections in June 1993.
	   Under the transitional agreement, President Pierre Buyoya and
National Assembly President Leonce Ngendakumana named 40 additional
legislators drawn from eight political parties that were not
represented in the previous legislature as well as members of civil
society, including six women.
	   Two years ago this month, Buyoya, a retired military officer and
former president, overthrew a shaky coalition government headed by
a Hutu on the grounds only he could stem the bloodshed that began
in October 1993 when Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's first
Hutu president.
	   Since that time an estimated 200,000 people, most of them
civilians, have been killed.
	   Regional states slapped economic and transport sanctions on
Burundi to force Buyoya to negotiate with Hutu rebels and restore
the democratic process.
	   Kenya, the largest economy in the region, said Wednesday it
favors the relaxing of some sanctions in acknowledgement of the
government's efforts to meet the demands.

Thai army says land mines pose dangers for reporters in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai army expressed concern
Thursday about allowing journalists to cross the border into
Cambodia to cover an upcoming national election because many areas
are sown with land mines.
	   The military has received a large number of requests from
journalists seeking to enter Cambodia by land to cover the July 26
polls in remote border areas.
	   A senior intelligence officer stationed along the border said
the military is considering whether to allow journalists to cross,
particularly into the town of Anlong Veng, a former stronghold of
Khmer Rouge rebels.
	   Cambodian government troops captured the area in April, forcing
the remaining Khmer Rouge hard-liners to flee. The officer said
fresh mines were planted during the fighting.
	   Cambodia is already one of the most heavily mined nations on
earth, with between 6 million and 10 million of the deadly devices
buried in its soil.
	   Two Thai soldiers were seriously wounded over the weekend when
they stepped on a mine while on patrol near a border pass near
Anlong Veng.
	   In April, three Thai soldiers were killed and eight injured when
a booby trap exploded as they patrolled the border.
	   The officer said it was not known who had set the trap, made
from artillery shells.

Four English hooligans sentenced to jail terms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Four English soccer hooligans received jail terms
Thursday for rioting in Marseille during the World Cup, French
radio reported.
	   The four, whose identities weren't immediately available, were
sentenced by a court in the southern city to terms ranging from 40
days to two months, Radio France Info said.
	   English fans battled local youths for three days June 13-15.
Along with violence by German thugs in the northern city of Lens,
which left a French policeman in a coma, they were among the worst
disturbances of the tournament.
	   In other violence marring the World Cup, a deranged English fan
stabbed a French actor to death on a train, apparently thinking the
Frenchman was mocking him after England's loss to Argentina.

Houllier set to take up Liverpool offer

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Liverpool called a news conference
Thursday for the expected appointment of Gerard Houllier as a
member of its coaching staff.
	   Houllier, France's national technical director, finished his
contract with the French soccer federation after France's World Cup
win on Sunday and had been considering an offer to move to Scottish
club Celtic.
	   The former France manager has known Liverpool vice-chairman
Peter Robinson since he worked as a teacher on Merseyside, which
may have swayed his decision to accept an offer from the Reds.
	   Houllier is expected to work with manager Roy Evans following
the retirement Wednesday of chief coach Ronnie Moran _ the man
dubbed ``Mr. Liverpool'' after 50 years service to the club.
	   Houllier coached Lens and Paris St. Germain before taking over
from Michel Platini as national coach after Euro '92. He resigned
in December 1993, a month after the French lost 3-1 to Bulgaria in
Paris.
	   World Cup winning manager Aime Jacquet was his successor.
	   Celtic had been negotiating with Houllier and was confident of
ending its 10-week wait for a manager to replace Wim Jansen, who
resigned after taking the club to its first Scottish title in a
decade on May 9.

Opposition leader Sam Rainsy thinks army will stay neutral

<TEXT>
	   KOMPONG CHAM, Cambodia (AP) _ Prominent opposition candidate Sam
Rainsy said Thursday that the Cambodian army will not prop up
strongman Hun Sen should he lose upcoming elections.
	   Sam Rainsy told reporters after a campaign rally in this eastern
city that commanders who belong to Hun Sen's Cambodian People's
Party have told him they will carry out the orders of whatever
legal government emerges.
	   Though Hun Sen has said he would peacefully transfer power if he
loses the polls July 26, he has resorted to armed force or the
threat of it many times to stay in power more than a decade, most
notably in street battles a year ago that deposed his co-prime
minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. The Cambodian leader is also
accused of violence and intimidation of opposition figures and
stacking the election machinery in his favor.
	   ``They make people believe there will be a war if Sam Rainsy
wins the election,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``I can tell you, I have
received assurances from the CPP military and the CPP police, they
will remain neutral. They will not follow Hun Sen in any action to
make trouble.''
	   But the run-up to the campaign turned increasingly violent.
Three ethnic Vietnamese were killed in an overnight attack by
unidentified gunman in their fishing village, the first time in the
campaign that members of the ethnic minority have been targeted for
death, officials said.
	   Sam Rainsy, Ranariddh and other opposition candidates have
played on deep-seated hatred of Vietnam in their rhetoric against
Hun Sen, who was supported by Hanoi's army during its decade-long
occupation of Cambodia after toppling the genocidal Khmer Rouge in
1979.
	   Meanwhile, Ranariddh's party reported that a grenade was thrown
at the house of a party official in Pursat, western Cambodia, on
Tuesday. No one was hurt.
	   The National Election Commission, which is overseeing the polls,
said that most of the provinces had received all their election
materials, though there was a slight shortage of indelible ink,
used to ensure people do not vote more than once.
	   The balance of military strength has long been the source of
power in Cambodia. Sam Rainsy commands no forces, so it is unclear
how he could enforce his claim on office should he win and Hun Sen
refuse to step aside.
	   Most of the 100,000-man army is considered loyal to Hun Sen,
though the depths of its allegiance is unclear. A cohort of private
bodyguards and special troops personally loyal to him spearheaded
last year's coup, routing Ranariddh's smaller forces.
	   A few hundred soldiers still loyal to Ranariddh have observed a
cease-fire since March, enabling the prince to return from exile to
campaign. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, a former member of the prince's
FUNCINPEC party, are considered Hun Sen's strongest challengers.
	   Ranariddh finished atop U.N.-sponsored parliamentary elections
in 1993, but Hun Sen forced his way into a co-premiership by
threatening civil war. The new elections are his attempt to win
back international legitimacy and foreign aid lost because of the
takeover.
	   Ranariddh said Wednesday that he feared arrest if Hun Sen faces
losing power. He predicted the most dangerous period would be
between the vote and the announcement of preliminary results eight
days later.
	   Sam Rainsy said that decades of misrule had destroyed Cambodia's
natural wealth. Corruption has led to rampant logging that harmed
the ecosystem, leading to drought and potential food shortages.
	   ``We used to be a large exporter of rice and now we are
starving,'' Sam Rainsy said. ``Something is wrong in this
country.''

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China's biggest securities company said
Thursday it has replaced its chairman and president and suspended
trading with its own money while regulators investigate financial
dealings by the two officials.
	   J and A Securities said senior company officials not under
investigation have replaced chairman Zhang Guoqing and president
Yang Jun.
	   Zhang is a former securities regulator in the southern boomtown
of Shenzhen, site of one of China's two stock exchanges. Under his
leadership, J and A has grown into a company with dlrs 2.1 billion
in assets and 60 branches throughout China.
	   But the company also has been fined several times and criticized
by regulators for unauthorized speculation in stocks and
commodities futures. The company has links to the commercially
active Chinese military.
	   J and A would not give details of the investigation, but company
sources told Dow Jones Newswires that regulators were looking into
large amounts of unreported funds and the company's ownership
structure. The company has declined to release the results of a
restructuring and stock issue last month or say who its new leading
shareholders are.
	   The decision to suspend proprietary trading, or trading with its
own money instead of that of clients, in stocks, bonds and mutual
funds could affect the entire Chinese securities market, securities
analysts said.
	   The company statement to employees Thursday insisted its assets
were unaffected by the investigation.
	   ``Never in J and A Securities' history have our assets been in
better condition,'' it said.

	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Leftists guerrillas in southern India
killed seven people early Thursday, police said.
	   Police said members of the People's War Group shot and killed a
former village headman in Kurnool district, 250 kilometers (150
miles) south of Hyderabad. Rival People's Power rebels retaliated,
killing six villagers believed to be People's War sympathizers.
	   Police said the two groups are apparently fighting over a plot
of land.
	   People's War is the main rebel group in the region. It was
founded in 1980 to fight for the rights of the poor peasants.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch police said Thursday they
are investigating an international ring that is spreading child
pornography on the Internet.
	   The ring, which operates mainly out of Berlin, peddles
pornographic material sometimes involving children aged less than
two years, the respected Dutch current affairs program NOVA
reported.
	   Computer discs containing thousands of ``very shocking'' photos
were discovered in the apartment of a ring member in the coastal
Dutch town of Zandvoort.
	   The owner of the apartment was recently murdered in Italy by a
fellow gang member.
	   One Dutch child psychologist told NOVA the material was the
worst he had ever seen.
	   It was the Belgian anti-pornography group Morkhoeven that
tracked down the Zandvoort address and seized the materials,
according to the German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost.
	   Regional police spokesman Jaap Hage declined comment on the
case, saying an investigation is still in progress. No arrests have
been made, he added.

Serbian police bursts into ethnic Albanian headquarters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Serbian police action, new information
throughout. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian security forces for the
first time ever surrounded and burst into the downtown headquarters
of Kosovo's ruling party Thursday, moments after ethnic Albanian
separatists constituted their clandestine parliament.
	   There was no official Serb explanation for the 30-minute action
by some 20 heavily-armed riot policemen and 10 plainclothes
officers, who entered the drab-looking makeshift building in the
heart of Kosovo's capital.
	   They impounded all written documents from the first session of
the clandestine ethnic Albanian parliament, which is considered
illegal by the Serbian authorities.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who compromise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million people, held their elections on March 22 for the 120-seat
self-styled parliament and the president.
	   Thursday's was the first visible action by the Serb forces in
the area of the ruling Democratic League of Kosovo party
headquarters, which also house the office of their leader, Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   Rugova was inside the building when the plainclothes policemen
stormed in.
	   ``The police action wasn't brutal, but it was very swift,'' said
Nekibe Kelmendi, the general secretary of the ruling LDK party,
which holds 90 percent of seats in the new parliament.
	   ``They gave us a two-minute ultimatum to hand them the documents
from the constitutional session, which we did,'' she added.
	   There were no violence or arrests, and the police, armed with
machine-guns and riot gear, withdrew after about 30 minutes.
	   During the unannounced session, Rugova gave his presidential
oath, saying he ``will use all his powers for the formation and
preservation of an independent Republic of Kosovo.''
	   Kelemendi said the formation of the Kosovo parliament was ``a
historic act and the result of a new reality in the region which
the international community will have to consider.''
	   Serbia rejects any moves toward Kosovo's independence. Foreign
powers have called for greater Kosovo autonomy, but oppose
independence of the troubled Serbian province.
	   There were no fresh reports of fighting on Thursday.
	   Fighting flared Wednesday in several areas of Kosovo. Serb and
ethnic Albanian media outlets reported that Wednesday's violence
left a total of 14 Serb policemen wounded, four ethnic Albanians
killed and 19 people wounded _ 14 Serb policemen and five Kosovo
Albanians.
	   More than 300 people have been killed since late February when
Serbian police launched a crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists.
	   Attempts by world powers to rally the splintered Albanian
politicians behind Rugova have been unsuccessful, and with
political efforts to gain independence faltering, the clandestine
Kosovo Liberation Army continues to gain support.

Opposition leader protests bad loan company bill
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The opposition leader in
Parliament accused the government Thursday of trying to hustle
through legislation to create a body to help debt-ridden companies
and banks burdened by bad loans.
	   ``It remains grossly unfair that on such an important bill
adequate time has not been given to MPs,'' said Lim Kit Siang,
leader of the Democratic Action Party.
	   In a statement, Lim said he received a draft of the bill to
create the Asset Management Co., called Danaharta in Malay, on
Saturday, two days before it was introduced in Parliament.
	   Several opposition members boycotted a debate on the bill
Wednesday. The protest was unlikely to affect passage of the bill
because Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's coalition has an
overwhelming majority. The DAP controls just nine seats in the
250-member house.
	   Lim accused the government of promoting a scheme to help select
banks and companies that are favored by government leaders.
	   Once Danaharta starts operating in August, it will negotiate
with banks on buying up non-performing loans. It aims to
rehabilitate these debts and take over the management of companies
that it feels are poorly run.
	   The agency's chief said Thursday the bad loan bank would be as
efficient and transparent as possible.
	   ``We'll go the full Monty,'' Managing Director Azman Yahya told
reporters. All Danaharta's acquisitions will be made public, he
said.
	   The creation of the company is part of the government's new
strategy to help companies grow out of the crisis, instead of
allowing weak ones to fold up.
	   This week, Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced Malaysia is
heading toward recession, with a possible 1 to 2 percent economic
shrinkage.

After czar's burial, what about Lenin?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With-BC-Russia-Czar's Burial
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ This week's burial of Russia's last czar raises an
even more sensitive question for the country: what should be done
with Vladimir Lenin, whose embalmed corpse is still on display in
Red Square?
	   The remains of Nicholas II and his family are to be buried
Friday in St. Petersburg, and lawmakers in parliament expressed
their widely varying opinions Thursday on the future of Lenin, the
founder of the Soviet state.
	   Lenin's body has been in a Red Square mausoleum since shortly
after his death in 1924 and remains a popular tourist attraction,
though less so than in Soviet times.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has raised the prospect of burying
Lenin, but the issue draws an emotional response from many
Russians, particularly older citizens.
	   ``By human and Christian standards, Lenin should have been
buried a long time ago,'' lawmaker Sergei Ivanenko, a member of the
liberal Yabloko faction, told the Interfax news agency. ``But this
is not the right time to bury Lenin as it may provoke an outbreak
of social confrontation.''
	   Vassily Shandybin, a Communist lawmaker, told the news agency
that Lenin's body should remain in the mausoleum forever because he
was ``a great man and the leader of the world's first socialist
state.''
	   Sergei Yushenkov, an independent lawmaker, told Interfax that
Lenin should have been buried shortly after the Soviet Union
collapsed, a time when many people where happy that communism had
ended. Now, he said, it would be strongly opposed by a large
section of the population, especially older Russians.
	   ``As long as the corpse of the bloody butcher (Lenin) is in the
mausoleum in the center of Moscow, the country will not be able to
develop in a civilized way,'' he said.
	   Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist lawmaker known for
his outrageous statements, said a mass grave should be built in St.
Petersburg and all of the country's leaders since the czar should
be buried there.
	   The remains of Lenin, Josef Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev, Leonid
Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko ``must be put into
this grave and space should be reserved for subsequent leaders,''
he told Interfax.
	   Communists and other hard-liners have strongly opposed plans to
bury Lenin. But Yeltsin and others, including top Orthodox Church
officials, have said they favor burying the body in St. Petersburg
next to Lenin's mother, as Lenin himself had requested.

Lithuania to ask France about POW graves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuania said Thursday it would ask
how France wants to care for recently discovered graves of around
700 French soldiers who died in Nazi captivity during World War II.
	   Two burial sites with the bodies of the French POWs were
uncovered this week, one near the resort town of Nida and another
site close to the port city of Klaipeda. Both coastal cities are
about 350 kilometers (220 miles) west of Vilnius, the capital.
	   Lithuania, the site of fierce battles in both World War I and
II, has agreements with Germany about caring for the graves of
German soldiers. Graves of Nazi fighters killed during World War II
are excavated and reburied in a special cemetery outside Klaipeda.
	   But the Lithuanian Ministry of Culture, which is responsible for
overseeing the care of war-era grave sites, said Lithuania has no
agreements with France. It said it wants to conclude one.
	   ``There is no such agreement with France now, so it's up to them
what to do with the remains of POWs we found,'' said ministry
spokesman Algimantas Galinskas, head of the service dealing with
the remains of soldiers slain during the war.
	   Alain Nicolas-Nicolaz, the military attache at France's embassy
in Vilnius, said French authorities were seeking further
information about the find.
	   ``We are eager to see the site, take photographs of it and then
make a decision only after we have all the information,'' he said.
	   Lithuanian authorities said they would forbid commercial
development around the sites during excavation, which is slated to
begin before the end of summer.
	   Galinskas said Lithuanian archaeologists had long suspected
there were French remains in the area. But he said crosses marking
the graves had been removed during the war, and their exact
locations were lost.
	   Lithuania was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944.

Thai Supreme Court rules victims of 1992 military crackdown can
</HEADLINE>
sue &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's Supreme Court ruled Thursday
that relatives of victims of a violent 1992 military crackdown
against pro-democracy demonstrators can sue the army, police
department and leaders of the military government then in power for
damages.
	   The court also waived any civil court fees the relatives would
have to pay. Plaintiffs in Thai civil suits normally have to pay
court fees based on a percentage of the damages they are seeking.
	   The landmark ruling was a victory for victims' families, who
have said in the past that they were bitter that the perpetrators
of the violence have gone unpunished, and in many cases been
rewarded by society.
	   Named in the relatives' civil suit are former Prime Minister
Gen. Suchinda Kraprayoon, ex-Air Force Chief Marshal Kaset
Rojananil and ex-Interior Minister Gen. Issarapong Noonpakdi.
	   Thailand's constitutional monarch King Bhumibol Adulyadej
pardoned all of them for their roles in the incidents called
``Black May,'' and thus they cannot be brought before a criminal
court.
	   The three military men were part of a clique of commanders that
toppled an elected prime minister, Chatichai Choonhavan, in a coup
in 1991.
	   After promising to return power to the people, Suchinda had
Parliament name him prime minister, enraging middle class Thais,
who took to Bangkok's streets in protest in May 1992.
	   The army opened fire on the crowds. More than 40 people were
killed, more than a hundred wounded and at least 40 are still
missing.
	   King Bhumibol intervened, forcing Suchinda to resign and end the
bloodshed.
	   Nonetheless, Suchinda is still treated with respect by military
and business leaders. He sits on the board of directors of Telecom
Asia, a blue-chip Thai company, and military officers regularly
visit him, bearing gifts on his birthday.
	   In 1996, the former coup leaders threw a lavish party to
commemorate their seizure of power.

Turkish appeals court hears slain journalist case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Lawyers for a senior police officer
convicted in the beating death of a journalist asked an appeals
court Thursday to overturn the verdict, claiming he had no
knowledge of the violence against the victim.
	   The court is expected to issue its verdict Friday.
	   Senior police officer Seydi Battal Kose was sentenced to 7 1/2
years in prison in March together with four other policemen for
beating to death Metin Goktepe, a 27-year-old journalist under
detention in 1996. Kose was in charge of a sports hall which police
used as a detention center.
	   Kose's lawyer said the defendant had not ordered the beating nor
had seen anyone being beaten on Jan 9, 1996.
	   The case received wide attention as a test of Turkey's human
rights record. Human rights groups had criticized the sentences as
too light, claiming they would not deter police brutality. Six
other officers were acquitted.
	   The defendants claimed Goktepe's death was accidental. They said
he died after falling off a wall and hitting his head.
	   His body was found in an Istanbul park the day after he and
hundreds of other people were detained during a funeral for
prisoners killed in jail riots. He was covering the funeral for a
left-wing daily, Evrensel.

Asiaweek cites `pattern of conspiracy' in Jakarta riots
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asiaweek magazine says a monthlong
investigation has uncovered a pattern of conspiracy in the shooting
of four students and subsequent riots that preceded the downfall of
President Suharto.
	   The news weekly said in a statement late Wednesday that the
mastermind may never be known, but that many Indonesians link
Suharto's son-in-law, Lt. Gen. Prabowo Subianto, to the riots.
	   The full story is in the July 24 edition of the magazine, which
goes on sale later this week.
	   A monthlong investigation including interviews with military
officers, lawyers, human rights activists, victims and witnesses
``shows a clear pattern of conspiracy'' surrounding the shootings
of the students on May 12, which triggered riots in the capital,
Asiaweek said.
	   Little more than a week later, Suharto resigned.
	   Witnesses reported that motorcycle-riding uniformed police shot
into the crowd at the university, killing the students. But
Asiaweek said military sources told a human rights panel that a
week before the protest, four members of the motorcyle unit
disappeared along with their uniforms.
	   The weekly also said that police commissioners have testified
that police were issued rubber bullets rather than live ammunition
on the day of the shooting. It said a bullet taken from one of the
dead was not police issue.
	   It quoted a senior military officer as saying he believed that
Prabowo wanted to create sufficient chaos that his rival, armed
forces chief Gen. Wiranto, would not be able to restore order and
Suharto would have to declare martial law.
	   Under those conditions, it said, Prabowo would be able to take
charge.
	   Asiaweek also quoted military sources as saying that in the week
before the riots, hundreds of young men were brought to the capital
from East Timor, and were dispatched to encourage crowds to start
rioting.
	   In the days that followed, more than 1,000 people died in the
pillaging, looting and burning.
	   Asiaweek quoted a source close to the military as saying that as
of early July, 74 soldiers of Prabowo's Kopassus strategic reserves
were missing from their barracks, and that they were thought to be
on the streets of Jakarta, collecting information and covering
their tracks.

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Former French national team coach
Gerard Houllier on Thursday was appointed joint manager of
Liverpool.
	   Houllier, 51, signed a two-year deal to work alongside current
Reds manager Roy Evans.
	   Houllier, France's national technical director, finished his
contract with the French soccer federation after France's World Cup
win on Sunday and had been considering an offer to move to Scottish
club Celtic.
	   The former France manager has known Liverpool vice-chairman
Peter Robinson since he worked as a teacher on Merseyside, which
may have swayed his decision to accept an offer from the Reds.
	   Robinson stressed Evans had been very much involved in bringing
Houllier to Anfield.
	   ``After many meetings and much discussion, in which Roy Evans
has been fully involved, we have been successful in persuading
Gerard Houllier to join us as joint team manager,'' Robinson said.
	   The 51-year-old will work in tandem with Evans following the
retirement Wednesday of chief coach Ronnie Moran _ the man dubbed
``Mr. Liverpool'' after 50 years service to the club.
	   Houllier coached Lens and Paris St. Germain before taking over
from Michel Platini as national coach after Euro '92. He resigned
in December 1993, a month after the French lost 3-1 to Bulgaria in
Paris.
	   World Cup winning manager Aime Jacquet was his successor.
	   Celtic had been negotiating with Houllier and was confident of
ending its 10-week wait for a manager to replace Wim Jansen, who
resigned after taking the club to its first Scottish title in a
decade on May 9.

Russian patriarch rules out meeting with pope this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Patriarch Alexy II, head of the Russian Orthodox
Church, has ruled out a meeting this year with Pope John Paul II.
	   In an interview published Wednesday in the Kommersant daily,
Alexy said relations with the Vatican were complicated and strained
because of the activities of Roman Catholic missionaries in Russia
and Ukraine.
	   He said there were 10 Roman Catholic missions operating in
Russia, ``and in the opinion of the church, they are trying to
convert people rooted in Orthodoxy.''
	   Alexy said a meeting with John Paul II this year ``is
impossible,'' but he did not completely rule out a future meeting
with the pontiff. ``Our meeting with the pope should be the result
of lengthy preparations,'' he said.
	   The Russian Orthodox Church considers the activities of the
Roman Catholic clergy in Russia as proselytism and differences
between the two churches caused the cancellation of planned meeting
in Austria last year.
	   It would have been the first meeting between the pope and a
Russian patriarch since the schism of 1054 divided Christians into
the Catholic and Orthodox churches.

Festina team director suspended; he and doctor still in detention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW grafs 9-14 to UPDATE with comment from doctors. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHOLET, France (AP) _ The cloud over the Tour de France was
growing quickly Thursday with the suspension of Festina team
director Bruno Roussel due to a growing drug controversy.
	   The International Cycling Union announced Thursday morning, just
before the start of the Tour's fifth stage, that Roussel had failed
to respond adequately to an investigation from the French Cycling
Federation.
	   It said it had suspended his cycling license, and therefore he
will not be able to work on the Tour de France.
	   But Jean-Marie LeBlanc, the Tour de France director, said there
was no reason to suspend the team from competing for the moment.
The police conducted a search of the riders' rooms on Wednesday.
	   Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were still in detention in
Cholet, after being taken in for questioning by police following
Wednesday's stage.
	   Police from the northern city of Lille came down to conduct the
investigation. That's where a Belgian member of the Festina team
has been under arrest since last week, when he was found with a
stash of performance-enhancing drugs in a team car.
	   The scandal was on the front page of virtually all French
newspapers Thursday.
	   ``The Tour is Derailed,'' headlined the Liberation daily.
``Police at the Finish Line,'' said Le Parisien. ``It's Going
Badly,'' said France-Soir. ``The Tour Poisoned,'' said Le Figaro.
	   The media was also full of comments by doctors and others saying
they'd expected such a scandal to happen some day.
	   ``This Festina affair doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Dr. Guy
Zerhat, former doctor for the Bic cycling team in the 1970s.
	   ``I am happy it is breaking out today, in everyone's interest,
beginning with the cyclists themselves,'' he said on France 3
television.
	   He said that when he treated members of various teams, ``I saw
horrible things. I saw boys inject themselves during the race.''
	   Another doctor, specializing in doping, said the practice is
``part of daily life.''
	   ``The athlete has simply appropriated a practice that is
widespread in other fields,'' said Dr. Patrick Laure in an
interview with the daily ``L'Est Republicain.''
	   The Festina team issued a statement Wednesday saying Roussel
wished to be heard.
	   He got his wish later, when police offically detained him.
French law allows detention of up to 48 hours before further
action.
	   Festina's main sponsors, the Spanish watch company Festina, are
threatening to break their contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

Time Engineering confirms restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Time Engineering confirmed
Thursday that the telecommunications company and nine of its
subsidiaries were undergoing restructuring.
	   ``The exercise will involve a debt and capital restructuring,''
a Time Engineering statement said.
	   On Tuesday, Time Engineering and its units were granted a
nine-month court protection from their creditors.
	   The nine subsidiaries are Time Telecommunications Holdings, Time
Telecommunications, Time Wireless, TimeSat, Time Reach, Time
Automation and Managing Services, Time Spectrum, Time System
Integration and Time Quantum Technology.
	   ``The restructuring exercise will enable Time to grow its fixed,
mobile and pay phone businesses with a strategic partner injecting
additional funds,'' it said.
	   The company said it would like to assure its customers,
suppliers and business partners that ``business and services will
continue as usual.''
	   Malaysian law allows a company to seek court protection from its
creditors while it devises a plan to regain its financial footing.
	   At the end of a specified period, the company can stay in
business if it receives approval from the majority of its
creditors, or those holding 75 percent of its debt.
	   Rumors that the Time companies would gain such protection have
led to a dumping of their shares since Friday, affecting the
broader market.
	   The number of companies seeking court protection against
creditors has been rising as the economy sinks and more companies
struggle to repay debts.

Tokyo court rejects Chinese woman's appeal for wartime
</HEADLINE>
compensation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese court on Thursday rejected an appeal for
compensation from a Chinese woman whose civilian husband was
allegedly killed by Japanese soldiers in China during World War II.
	   The Tokyo District Court ruled the 20-year statute of
limitations had expired for the claim by Huang Shuyuan, 80, of
Tianjin, China, a court official said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Huang filed a suit against the Japanese government in 1995,
seeking 25 million yen (dlrs 178,000).
	   The suit alleged that in August 1940, the Japanese army staff
visited a village in China where the couple lived, and her husband
started working at a live-in construction site.
	   But the husband complained of tough labor conditions and escaped
from the site, Huang said in the suit. He was later caught by the
Japanese military and died after being beaten up by soldiers, she
claimed.
	   Japan occupied much of China from the early 1930s through the
end of World War II, and its troops are accused of atrocities
against civilians. Several groups of Chinese citizens have sued the
Japanese government for compensation.

Millions of Iraqis struggle with power cuts in scorching summer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The price of ice has soared in many parts
of Iraq where millions of people are using it for refrigeration
because of the summer power cuts.
	   In the northern city of Mosul, a 3-kilogram (7-pound) block of
ice is selling for 3,500 dinars (dlrs 2.33), seven times its price
last month, residents contacted by phone said Thursday.
	   To cope with the scorching heat, many people in Iraq's third
largest city leave their homes in the afternoon and sit in the
shade, after spraying the ground with water, a Mosul resident said.
	   The ministry of industry and minerals says at least 2 million
Iraqi families have no power supply at all. The problem is worst in
the small towns and villages, where many people sleep on the roof
to escape temperatures that reach 50 Celsius (122 Fahrenheit) in
the shade during the day.
	   Only the 4 million residents of Baghdad, the capital, can count
on an almost 24-hour supply of power. In other cities, the
blackouts can last 20 hours a day.
	   In the southern city of Basra, Iraq's second largest, residents
told The Associated Press the cuts can last two or three days.
	   Mothers wave fans to drive flies away from their babies. Some
families pitch make-shift tents of old cloths and rags to protect
their children from heat.
	   Industry ministry officials blame the electricity crisis on the
lack of spare parts. In turn, this is blamed on a lack of funds and
eight years of the trade sanctions that the United Nations imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
	   Officials of U.N. relief agencies in Iraq say the power supply
network is in a shambles. To rehabilitate the network would cost at
least dlrs 10 billion, the officials say.
	   Under the current phase of the oil-for-food program _ by which
Iraq is allowed to bypass sanctions and sell oil to buy food and
humanitarian supplies _ Iraq has earmarked dlrs 400 million to
purchase spare parts for its electricity network.
	   But it will be several months before these supplies arrive.
Ministry officials say that some contracts for electricity supplies
are still outstanding from earlier six-month phases of the
oil-for-food program, which began in December 1996.
	   The contracts were either rejected by the U.N. sanctions
committee in New York, which is wary of approving equipment that
could have a military use, or were delayed, the ministry says.
	   In New York on Wednesday, the U.N. official in charge of
humanitarian programs in Iraq, Benon Sevan, said there had been
unacceptably long delays in funneling oil-for-food program money to
north Iraq to fix the power supply.
	   Sevan said the hydroelectric dams at Derbendikan and Dokan were
in a critical state of disrepair.
	   In Baghdad, the industry ministry has found itself with few
friends because in April it predicted that people would suffer
fewer power cuts this summer than last year. It apparently gambled
on the arrival of a large order of spare parts.

Russia's parliament weighs austerity package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS lead to show that Duma has passed general law on tax
collection sted of taxes on the rich. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The hard-line parliament approved a general law
Thursday on Russia's tax code, but was slow to act on several key
elements of President's Boris Yeltsin's austerity program.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders want Russia to
cut spending and improve its weak tax collection system before
releasing funds from a multi-billion-dollar loan package that was
agreed on Monday.
	   But the Communists and nationalists in parliament generally
oppose spending cuts and tax hikes, arguing that such measures will
hurt ordinary Russians.
	   By Thursday afternoon, parliament had approved the final reading
of a bill that clarifies the rights of tax payers and tax
collectors. The bill also sets forth ``general principles of tax
collection,'' the Interfax news agency said.
	   But parliament's lower house, the State Duma, had not yet acted
on major tax reforms. Yeltsin's administration has sent more than
20 proposals to parliament, and only a few have been approved.
	   Thursday was the second and final day of a special Duma session
devoted to the government's austerity plan, and lawmakers were
expected to meet well into the evening.
	   Russia is in urgent need of cash, and the loan agreement would
bring dlrs 17.1 billion in new funds this year and next to help
stabilize financial markets that have been sinking for months.
	   The Communists are wary of the loan package, saying it could
saddle Russia with debt it cannot afford to repay. But Russia
already must pay off billions of dollars in short-term debt that
will be due in coming months, and it probably can't meet the
payments without the new loans, analysts say.
	   If parliament fails to approve the main parts of the austerity
plan, the International Monetary Fund will be in an awkward
position when its board meets Monday in Washington to review the
Russian loan deal.
	   The IMF and others do not want to release the loans until they
are convinced Russia is serious about financial reform, but the
Russian markets are likely to crash if assistance doesn't arrive
soon.
	   Yeltsin has indicated he will implement some austerity measures
by decree if the parliament does not enact them. Still, Yeltsin was
optimistic Thursday that parliament would pass the measures.
	   ``Everything is proceeding normally and I think all
(discussions) will end with positive results,'' he said.
	   Before the bills become law, they must go to parliament's upper
house, which plans to review the package Friday.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.

`Zorro' star quits planned saga of Turkish leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Antonio Banderas has withdrawn from a film about
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, after intense
protests by Greek-Americans.
	   Banderas, the co-star of ``The Mask of Zorro,'' has left
producer Tarquin Olivier, 61, son of actor Laurence Olivier,
without a star for the dlrs 25 million project, The New York Times
reported Thursday.
	   Banderas' agent, Lisa Baum, said Banderas wanted to devote full
time to another film, ``The Phantom of the Opera.'' But Olivier
said Banderas withdrew in reaction to the protests.
	   One letter that appeared in a Greek-American publication was
signed by ``a member of the Greek community of (New York)'' and
described Ataturk as a ``savage maniac,'' ``a child molester,'' and
``mass murderer.''
	   Some publications also asked readers to send protest letters to
Banderas and his wife, Melanie Griffith. Olivier estimated the
couple may have received as many as 1,000 letters.
	   Ataturk is credited with creating modern Turkey out of the ruins
of the Ottoman Empire. Protesters of the film fear a favorable
portrayal might lead to a warming of popular feeling toward Turkey,
a historical rival of Greece.
	   Though Ataturk turned back Greek forces from Anatolia after
World War I, Greek Prime Minister Elevtherios Venizelos befriended
him and nominated him for the Nobel Peace Prize in 1934.
	   Ataturk died in 1938.

Australia praises Brazil's decision to forgo nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian Foreign Minister Alexander
Downer on Thursday praised Brazil's decision to accede to the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a ``landmark decision.''
	   ``I warmly welcome the announcement by President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso that Brazil has acceded to the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty and ratified the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty,'' Downer said.
	   ``This is a landmark achievement which highlights the
seriousness of Brazil's commitment to make every effort to prevent
the spread of weapons of mass destruction.''
	   Downer said a total of 187 countries are now parties to the
treaty, making it the most widely accepted arms control treaty. A
total of 16 countries have ratified the treaty.
	   Downer said Brazil's decision was particularly significant
because it came very soon after nuclear tests by both India and
Pakistan.
	   ``The intensity of the global reaction to those tests has
highlighted the fact that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and
other weapons of mass destruction is widely recognized as having
become the most serious threat to global security,'' Downer said.
	   ``By forswearing the acquisition of nuclear weapons, Brazil has
demonstrated its willingness to take responsibility for upholding
international nonproliferation and disarmament norms.''
	   Downer again urged India and Pakistan to become parties to the
treaty, as well as Israel and Cuba.

Israeli businessman sentenced to 16 years for sales to Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu quotes in grafs 3, 9-10 &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a high-profile treason case tinged
with scandal, an Israeli businessman was sentenced to 16 years in
prison on Thursday for selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   Judge Amnon Straschnov said the defendant, former paratrooper
Nachum Manbar, sacrificed Israel's security ``on the altar of
unfettered greed.'' Iran is one of Israel's most implacable foes.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was pleased with the
verdict, saying Manbar had committed ``heinous crimes'' by
supplying Iran with material ``to rain down chemical death on
Israel's cities _ on our citizens and children.''
	   Manbar, who faced life in prison, sat stone-faced as he heard
the decision. When he was walked out of Tel Aviv District Court,
Manbar shouted: ``There will be an appeal.''
	   Earlier this week, Manbar's lead defense attorney, Amnon
Zichroni, had alleged that Straschnov had secretly maintained a
``close, intensive'' relationship with Pninat Yanai, a female
member of the defense team who was eventually fired.
	   Straschnov has denied the allegations and rejected defense
demands that he withdraw from the case before passing sentence.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Manbar's conviction and sentence.
Despite his earlier charges against the judge, Zichroni was evasive
Thursday when asked whether he would make alleged improper judicial
conduct a key element of his appeal.
	   Nissim Zvili, a legislator from the opposition Labor Party, had
called Tuesday for an investigation of allegations that Netanyahu
had discussed the case with Straschnov and tried to influence him.
Zvili has since withdrawn the demand, saying he accepted the
judge's denial. Netanyahu also denied having had any contact with
Straschnov.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday accused the opposition of taking advantage
of the Manbar affair to raise ``baseless claims'' in order to
defame him and the integrity of Israel's justice system.
	   ``If I ever thought there was a limit to how low my opponents
were willing to go, it turns out I was wrong,'' he said.
	   Manbar's trial was held behind closed doors for security
reasons.
	   But Yossi Melman, a journalist who covers the intelligence
services for Haaretz, said Manbar started out selling defensive
equipment, such as gas masks and gas detectors, to Iran with the
knowledge of the Israeli defense establishment in the early 1990s.
	   However, at some point Manbar allegedly began selling chemicals
that can be used both in agriculture and in making poison gas,
Melman said. Manbar was warned by Israeli intelligence in late 1993
to stop those sales, Melman said.
	   Manbar was not alone in selling to Iran, Melman said. In the
early 1990s, Israeli companies sold mortar shells and fertilizer
with the knowledge of the security establishment, he said.
	   A change came in 1994, when Mossad chief Shabtai Shavit said
Iran should be perceived as a strategic threat to Israel and urged
the government to change its policy accordingly, Melman said.
	   Straschnov on Thursday made a reference to the permissive
atmosphere at the time. The defense has said Manbar was not alone
in selling to Iran, and that he did not supply offensive materials.
	   ``We cannot ignore the arguments of the defense, which were
heard behind closed doors,'' Straschnov said. ``We believe that
even if we are just talking about a few cases that were not similar
to this one ... they still had considerable weight in not imposing
the maximum sentence,'' he said.

Ukraine welcomes economic aid for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The Ukrainian government praised the
international credit agencies and governments who pledged a dlrs 22
billion aid package to Russia, saying the decision would help all
countries in the region.
	   ``Such positive steps will facilitate financial and economic
stabilization not only in Russia, but in all countries of the
region and in the countries with developing economies,'' a
government statement released Wednesday said.
	   Earlier in the week, Ukraine's National bank chairman Viktor
Yushchenko said the aid package as a positive sign for the entire
region that would help attract foreign investors.
	   The International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and Japan have
promised Moscow a total of around dlrs 22 billion in emergency
economic aid over a two-year period.
	   Ukraine, which is experiencing an acute financial crisis, is
seeking a dlrs 2.5 billion loan from the IMF.
	   An IMF mission is expected in Kiev next week, and Ukrainian
officials are optimistic it will recommend releasing the loan. The
fund last year refused to release a similar loan because of the
stalled economic reforms in the former Soviet republic.
	   ``Ukraine is counting on practical support of the IMF,'' the
government's statement said.
	   It also stressed the government's determination to service and
redeem all of Ukraine's foreign and domestic state liabilities ``in
time and in full amount.''
	   ``The position in the government in this issue remains
unchanged,'' said the statement, signed by Deputy Prime Minister
Serhiy Tihipko and Finance Minister Ihor Mytyukov
	   That appeared to be a response to this week's announcement by
the bond rating agency Moody's that it could lower its B2 rating
for Ukraine. Moody's said Kiev has been gradually depleting its
foreign currency reserves, which ``implies the risk of default on
its foreign debt obligations.''

Rice exports to be down as country ensures food security
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam expects rice exports to be well
below the government's target as it increases national food
reserves amid a string of natural disasters, a top official said
Thursday.
	   ``This year's projection of rice exports is only 3.5 million
tons,'' down from the original estimate of 4 million tons, ideology
chief Huu Tho told reporters in a briefing on the just completed
Communist Party plenum.
	   Despite the damage from Typhoon Linda last September and the
worst drought in a century earlier this year, the government
expects food production for the year to be up 300,000 tons from
1997, Tho said.
	   But the government is worried that the expected La Nina weather
phenomenon will further exacerbate current flooding following the
late onset of the rainy season last month.
	   Tho said the national food reserves _ the size of which are a
secret _ will be increased by 10 percent and will be spread around
the country to ensure that food aid is delivered quickly to
affected areas.
	   The central government already had ordered rice allocations for
families most seriously affected by the drought and flooding.
	   With 80 percent of the populace directly involved in farming,
Tho said guaranteeing that there is enough food will ensure the
country's security.
	   He said the party also has set an unspecified target for cutting
the bad debts of Vietnam's troubled banking sector as part of its
efforts to improve the environment for foreign investment, which
has been declining amid the Asian economic crisis.
	   The plenum, which generally sets policy that is then implemented
with legislation by the National Assembly, cannot adjust the growth
and other economic targets that almost certainly will not be
reached.
	   But Tho said the government likely will have proposals for the
National Assembly to consider when it starts its monthlong autumn
session in October.
	   Tho said that while the plenum heard assessments of economic and
social activity in the first six months of the year, it largely
focused on cultural development: helping the country integrate into
the world community without losing its individuality or its
socialist system.
	   The country's culture will continue to be based on a core of
Marxism, Leninism and revolutionary hero Ho Chi Minh's philosophy.
The other key ingredients are patriotism, progressiveness and
humanity.
	   While the country's development has spurred some positive
changes, it also has fostered materialism and a decrease in
spiritualism, Tho said.
	   ``People pay more attention to short-term interests,'' while
neglecting long-range issues like the environment, he said.
	   In addition, the benefits of the decade-long Doi Moi reforms
have yet to reach many people in the countryside.

Report: Pope not welcome in Romania because of church conflict
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Pope John Paul II may not be welcome
in Romania because of a conflict between Eastern Rite Catholics and
the majority Orthodox Church over church property, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile recently invited the pope to Romania
during a meeting at the Vatican. The invitation reportedly had the
oral blessing of Patriarch Teoctist, the head of the Orthodox
Church.
	   The Orthodox Church press office declined to comment Thursday,
and government spokesman Tudor Anghel called the church's apparent
change of mind ``speculation.''
	   However, daily Libertatea reported the Holy Synod decided
Wednesday not to invite the pontiff until ``divergencies'' were
resolved between the two churches.
	   A visit by the pope in Transylvania, where most Eastern Rite
Catholics live, ``would be seen as a threat by the Orthodox
faithful that they would lose their churches,'' said Liviu Stoinea,
a professor at the Orthodox theology institute, as quoted by
Libertatea. Catholics make up only five percent of the population.
	   The Communists seized Catholic properties in 1948 and handed
them to the Orthodox Church. Tensions over who owns the buildings
have erupted between the two, culminating in a recent cathedral
brawl in the Transylvanian city of Cluj.
	   After a lengthy trial, Eastern Rite Catholics, who are beholden
to the Vatican, were handed back a cathedral. The Orthodox, who
account for 90 percent of all Romanians, eventually agreed to
relinquish the cathedral. The Orthodox have their center in
Istanbul.

China and U.S. to cooperate on energy efficient buildings
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China and the United States will jointly design
office buildings that use less energy and can reduce production of
ozone-evaporating greenhouse gases, the U.S. Embassy said Thursday.
	   Designers from both sides will collaborate on a commercial
building in central Beijing featuring energy-saving materials and
renewable energy technology, the embassy said in a statement.
	   ``We will be integrating U.S. building know-how and expertise
with Chinese building practices to design energy-efficient
buildings that can both save money and reduce greenhouse gas
emissions,'' the statement quoted acting U.S. Secretary of Energy
Elizabeth Moler as saying.
	   U.S. Ambassador James Sasser and China's Science and Technology
Vice Minister Deng Nan signed an agreement on the building design
July 9. Deng is a daughter of former leader Deng Xiaoping.
	   China's booming economy has transformed its cities into bustling
construction zones, broadly raising living standards for its 1.2
billion people.
	   But exploding numbers of vehicles, increased energy demand and
industrial waste have created serious air and water pollution
problems, turning Beijing's skies hazy gray much of the year.

25 injured in clashes during Bangladesh strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Baton-wielding policemen clashed with
opposition party activists who had exploded crude bombs during a
general strike, injuring at least 25 people Thursday, witnesses
said.
	   A dozen homemade bombs _ small pots filled with explosives _
exploded in Dhaka's main Motijheel commercial district. Police said
they detained five protesters for throwing a bomb in at downtown
Nayabazar district.
	   The strike, called by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party to protest frequent power cuts, shut down stores and halted
traffic for six hours.
	   Bangladesh produces some 2,000 megawatts of electricity a day,
but peak hour demand is up to 2,500 megawatts. The opposition
accuses the government of incompetence.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's two-year-old government says it
has insufficient power generation equipment.

Don't let William, Harry be 'shadows' of Princess Diana, says her
</HEADLINE>
mother &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons should not be forced to
become her ``shadows,'' the princess' mother says in a television
interview to be aired Thursday in the United States..
	   In the documentary ``The Real Diana,'' to be broadcast by Fox,
Frances Shand Kydd also says she spent the three nights before the
funeral among mourners outside Diana's Kensington Palace home,
drawing strength from their grief, according to a transcript
published in The Mirror newspaper.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd said her hope for Prince William, 16, and
Princce Harry, 13, was ``that they grow up to be themselves, that
they will literally become themselves, the natural process of
growing up.''
	   ``They want privacy in private times. I wouldn't want them to
be, or expect them to be, pointed in the direction of being a
shadow of their mother, because they are themselves,'' she said.
``My hopes are they have peace, love, affection and protection to
become themselves as adults.''
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd professed surprise at the mass grieving that
followed Diana's death Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash. ``There aren't
words to describe it and Diana above all would have had no concept
of what has happened because of her,'' she said.
	   She reaffirmed her faith in the French investigation of the
crash and said ``whatever the findings are I will accept them.''
	   Speaking in the library at the Spencer family's ancestral home,
Althorp House, she commended her son Charles, the 9th Earl Spencer,
for setting up a museum in memory of his sister.
	   The exhibition, which is open to the public for two months this
summer, is a personal tribute to the princess and includes
mementoes from her childhood and home video footage of the young
Diana.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd called it ``really quite simply, breathtaking''
and said some of the press coverage of it had been ``very harsh and
very hurtful at times.'' Some newspaper articles had accused
Spencer of profiting from his sister's death.
	   ``I had qualms about it, nerves about it, wondering how I'd
feel,'' Mrs. Shand Kydd told interviewer Cathy Crier. But, ``it is
beautiful. It just flows from beginning to end. It's very quiet,
poignant, powerful. It's very calm,'' she said.
	   She said her son may decide to change the exhibit, perhaps
annually, to show some of the mass of material that has
accumulated.
	   Several times, Mrs. Shand Kydd deflected probing personal
questions. And she abruptly ended the interview when Crier tried to
ask about the occasion last month when Mohamed Al Fayed, father of
Diana's boyfriend Dodi, who died in the car crash, called her a
snob and a poor mother, she abruptly ended the interview.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A leading prosecutor has recommended that
Spain turn down a request from Portugal to extradite a former agent
who admitted murdering a prominent dissident in the era of
Portuguese dictator Antonio Salazar, news reports said Thursday.
	   Eduardo Fungairino, chief prosecutor at the National Court,
ruled that the 15-year statute of limitations applied in the case
of the former secret policeman, Antonio Rosa Casaco, who is now 83,
the Spanish news agency EFE and other media reported.
	   Court officials said they could not confirm the report but added
that in any case it would be the court's judges who make a final
decision.
	   The murder of the dissident, Gen. Humberto Delgado, who was
known as ``the fearless general'' for opposing Salazar, occurred in
1965 outside the southwest Spanish town of Badajoz.
	   A Portuguese court in 1982 sentenced Rosa Casaco in absentia to
eight years in prison for the killing.
	   In January, Rosa Casaco admitted in a magazine interview that he
took part in the crime. He was arrested by Spanish police in April
and a month later Portugal requested his extradition.
	   Currently free on bail, Rosa Casaco and other secret police fled
Portugal after democracy was restored there in 1974 with a
bloodless coup.

Thai army says land mines pose dangers for reporters in Cambodia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The Thai army expressed concern
Thursday about allowing journalists to cross the border into
Cambodia to cover an upcoming national election because many areas
are sown with land mines.
	   The military has received a large number of requests from
journalists seeking to enter Cambodia by land to cover the July 26
polls in remote border areas.
	   A senior intelligence officer stationed along the border said
the military is considering whether to allow journalists to cross,
particularly into the town of Anlong Veng, a former stronghold of
Khmer Rouge rebels.
	   Cambodian government troops captured the area in April, forcing
the remaining Khmer Rouge hard-liners to flee. The officer said
fresh mines were planted during the fighting.
	   Cambodia is already one of the most heavily mined nations on
earth, with between 6 million and 10 million of the deadly devices
buried in its soil.
	   Two Thai soldiers were seriously wounded over the weekend when
they stepped on a mine while on patrol near a border pass near
Anlong Veng.
	   In April, three Thai soldiers were killed and eight injured when
a booby trap exploded as they patrolled the border.
	   The officer said it was not known who had set the trap, made
from artillery shells.

Cojuangco seeks dropping of graft case, lifting of travel ban
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Business tycoon Eduardo Cojuangco
Jr., a close associate of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, has
asked the Supreme Court to order a lower court to dismiss a case
against him and lift a travel ban.
	   In a petition made public Thursday, Cojuangco said the
government has already withdrawn charges against him, but the
anti-graft court, Sandiganbayan, has refused to dismiss the case.
	   The case stemmed from an allegedly illegal 2 million peso (dlrs
48,000) loan made by the Philippine Coconut Authority to a coconut
industry group. Cojuangco was a member of the governing board of
the coconut agency under Marcos.
	   Since 1995, Cojuangco has been required to seek the court's
permission before traveling abroad.
	   Cojuangco said the restriction will prevent him from doing his
job as the new chairman of San Miguel Corp., the Philippines'
largest food and beverage conglomerate.
	   Early this month, Cojuangco was re-appointed chairman of San
Miguel, a position he had held until Marcos was ousted 12 years
ago. The government that replaced Marcos seized Cojuangco's shares
on suspicion they were illegally acquired.
	   His return to San Miguel has raised fears of a resurgence of
Marcos-era ``crony capitalism'' in which businesses of close Marcos
associates flourished because of preferential treatment.
	   Cojuangco was among the backers of President Joseph Estrada's
successful bid in presidential elections on May 11. He is also
chairman of Estrada's Struggle of the Filipino Masses party.
	   Estrada's predecessor, Fidel Ramos, has warned that a return of
Marcos ``cronies'' could scare off investors who want fair
competition and a ``level playing field.''
	   Estrada, who took office on June 30, said he had nothing to do
with Cojuangco's return to San Miguel and will not allow a return
of ``crony capitalism.''

Two road accidents in Iran leave 42 dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Two road accidents in northeastern Iran have
left 42 people dead and nine injured, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   A bus carrying villagers from Mashhad, 900 kilometers (560
miles) northeast of the capital Tehran, collided with a truck on
Monday night, the Qods paper said.
	   Twenty-three people were killed, including the truck driver and
his son who was riding with him, and four people were injured, the
newspaper reported.
	   In the second accident, a bus carrying students from the central
city of Isfahan to Mashhad hit a truck loaded with wheat on Monday
night.
	   Qods said 19 people were killed and five injured in the
collision.
	   The collisions brought the casualty toll to 70 people dead and
more than 35 injured in accidents around Mashhad during the past
week, Qods added. Thousands of people have been traveling to and
from the holy city for a summer pilgrimage.

Basque paper shut down over links to ETA comes out under new name
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain, July 16 (AP) _ A Basque newspaper that was shut
down over its links to armed separatists came out Thursday with a
new name, a skeleton format and a vow to keep publishing.
	   A day after being closed by a judge probing the fundraising
network of the separatist group ETA, the newspaper Egin renamed
itself ``Basque Country News.''
	   The eight-page edition featured a banner headline in the Basque
language proclaiming ``We will save Egin'' and a photo of hooded
police sealing off its headquarters in the town of Hernani on
Wednesday.
	   The paper, published in the Basque city of San Sebastian, was
delivered in person by Egin journalists to several news
organizations in the region. It was not available at newsstands.
	   National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon ordered Egin and an
affiliated radio station closed, on grounds that they that had
close links to ETA's fundraising efforts.
	   Police also arrested 11 current or former board members at the
parent company of the two news outlets, Orain S.A.
	   Virtually all of Spain's political parties endorsed the judge's
actions, saying freedom of expression had limits. Egin regularly
published statements by ETA, including its claims of responsibility
for attacks.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people since 1968 in its
campaign for independence.
	   Mainstream newspapers were divided over the closedown. Some
expressed begrudging acceptance but others said the move was
heavy-handed and might backfire by giving Egin martyr status for
Basque nationalists.
	   The center-right daily El Mundo noted that Egin was the first
newspaper shut down in Spain since democracy was restored following
the death of Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975 after a 36-year
dictatorship.
	   ``As detestable and repugnant as it may be,'' the paper said of
Egin, ``it was nonetheless a news medium. Its absence will reduce
society's pluralism.''
	   The center-left El Pais said it was now up to the country's
judicial authorities to demonstrate that the action against Egin
and the radio was justified.
	   The new Basque Country News dedicated all of its coverage
Thursday to the pre-dawn police raids on its offices in Hernani and
three other cities in the Basque country and neighboring Navarra.
	   One article on the operation was headlined, ``an attack under
cover of darkness, with premeditation and treachery.''

Pioneering Greek woman poet Zoe Karelli dies at 96
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALONICA, Greece (AP) _ Zoe Karelli, who opened the doors of
poetry to a generation of Greek women, died Thursday. She was 96.
	   Karelli died of natural causes at her home in the northern port
of Salonica.
	   She is best known for a difficult-to-translate 1957 poem in
which she used the feminine article with the word ``mankind.'' The
poem became a manifesto for feminists and heralded the entry of
women into the Greek literary sphere.
	   ``In poetry I seek an appropriate and timely word,'' she said a
year before her death.
	   Known for her low-key public profile, Karelli began her prolific
career with the publication of her first short story in 1935. She
went on to publish a dozen collections of poetry, four plays,
several essays and short stories.
	   The Athens Academy, a group comprising the nation's cultural
elite, granted her associate membership in 1982. The Academy only
started conferring full membership on women last year.
	   Karelli's poetry was translated into English, French, Italian
and Polish.
	   She was fluent in five languages, and translated much of T.S.
Eliot and James Joyce's works into Greek.
	   Born Chrisoula Argiriadou in 1901 in Salonica, she and her
brother, also a well-known writer, helped create a new movement in
Greek letters known as the Salonica School.
	   Karelli received the highest honors awarded by the Greek state
and was considered for the Nobel prize in literature.
	   Her funeral will take place Friday. There was no information on
survivors.

World Cup had ups and downs for French hosts

	   PARIS (AP) _ World Cup victory gave the French a soul, President
Jacques Chirac said, but France also has a mountain of unsold fuzzy
stuffed roosters, huge overtime bills and disillusioned merchants.
	   On a grand scale, most Frenchmen agree, the month-long soccer
extravaganza was a smashing success. But now, as accountants begin
to tote up the francs and centimes, others see it as a mixed
blessing.
	   Although soccer fans came by the hundreds of thousands, the
freer spending tourists who normally fill up France each summer
stayed away. And Frenchmen sat home by their television sets.
	   At the same time, official spending soared because of serial
mass littering, fighting in the streets and the constant underlying
threat of terrorism.
	   Few figures are available yet, but the evidence is clear.
	   ``Frankly, we expected better,'' said Yazid Chaboune, manager of
Paris Souvenirs, on the Champs Elysees where fans of every team
made their headquarters.
	   ``It is simple to understand,'' he said. ``The good clientele,
those who come to see Paris and buy souvenirs, won't show up until
later. World Cup people only eat and drink. We get nothing.''
	   But restaurateurs and hotel keepers had equal complaints.
	   ``Business is off, probably by more than 10 percent for most of
the better places,'' said Doreen Dempski, manager of the posh
Laperouse Restaurant. ``We had a few big parties. But that's it.''
	   Laperouse had to cancel a major event for Christian Dior when
the haute couture fashion shows were postponed. The Pret-a-Porter
show was moved to New York to avoid clashing with the World Cup.
	   Bordeaux and Nantes reported minor windfalls, offset by heavy
municipal expenditure. Marseille, Lyon and Toulouse saw the same
phenomenon as in Paris.
	   ``Football fans are a sandwich and pizza crowd,'' said Roland
Frittoli, owner of Peron, Marseille's oldest eatery. ``They live at
camping sites and cook their own food. Nothing to earn there.''
	   Many of his regular customers left town or stayed at home, he
said. Several large parties booked well in advance were canceled.
	   At Fauchon in Paris, spokeswoman Alice Bouteille said sales were
not affected one way or the other. ``We never had any illusions,''
she said. ``These are not deluxe gastronomy customers.''
	   In human terms, the cost was high.
	   A 42-year-old Frenchman died from injuries suffered when a woman
lost control of her Volkswagen and plowed into the World Cup
victory party on the Champs Elysees early Sunday. At least 80 were
injured.
	   A young policeman remains near death in Lille after German
neo-Nazis slammed him in the head with a metal bar during a
carefully planned bout of violence.
	   Thousands of injuries, some of them serious, were reported at
the 10 World Cup venues. Many were from Marseille where local
ethnic North Africans and English fans fought pitched battles.
	   Only time will determine whether France can amortize more than a
billion dollars spent on lasting projects, such as the 80,000-seat
Stade de France and stadium renovations elsewhere.
	   A more immediate problem is what to do with all the soccer
paraphernalia that is growing rapidly obsolete.
	   The official France 98 shop on the Champs Elysees, scheduled to
close on Aug. 15, offers mounds of jerseys marked Iran, South Korea
and two dozen other country names in limited demand.
	   French team items remain hot, but few people seem interested in
the approved World Cup cologne or playing cards.
	   Some merchants cleaned up over the past six weeks. Sales of
television sets and video recorders doubled. Anyone offering beer
in bulk or canned-air horns is happy. But they are exceptions.
	   Rene Faucheux, whose combination sandwich shop and butchery
caters to all levels of consumers, was as thrilled as any Frenchman
to see a World Cup victory.
	   But for the rest, he was not impressed. He would have much
rather had a normal month, with his regulars and the reliable flow
of tourists he sees every year.
	   ``The World Cup crowd is terrible,'' Faucheux said. ``They make
a mess, lots of noise, scare away normal customers, and spend
little. Except for a few guys, I don't think anyone made money.''

Strike idles MEA planes, only one flight takes off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Pilots of Lebanon's national airline
walked off their jobs Thursday, forcing the cancellation of 21
flights to and from Beirut International Airport.
	   The state-owned Middle East Airlines operated only one flight,
to London, flown by two pilots who are administrative employees.
The Pilots' Union, which represents MEA's 160 pilots, suspended the
two pilots from the union.
	   MEA's 10 other departing flights and 11 incoming flights were
canceled because of the 24-hour strike, which was called to demand
among other things higher salaries, improved benefits and
compensation for extra work in previous years.
	   An MEA pilot earns an average of about dlrs 3,000 a month.
	   The strike began midnight Wednesday (2100 GMT) and will end
Thursday midnight.
	   MEA passengers were placed on some of the 15 other foreign
airlines flying into and out of Beirut.
	   The Lebanese airline also was chartering a foreign plane to
ferry passengers from and to Paris later in the day, officials
said.
	   MEA, which employs about 5,000 people, is Lebanon's second
biggest employer after the public sector. It has a fleet of 15
aircraft and their destinations include South America and
Singapore.
	   MEA incurred dlrs 100 million losses in the last few years. The
government bought a 99 percent stake in the company after debts
owed to the Central Bank were converted into shares.

U.N. experts leave Iraq with 80 samples for VX tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms experts left Baghdad Thursday
with 80 samples of missile warheads that will be tested for traces
of the deadly VX gas, a U.N. spokeswoman said.
	   Janet Sullivan said the samples were taken from a warehouse in
the military camp of Taji, north of Baghdad, where the United
Nations keeps parts of missiles it has retrieved from a disposal
site. The warehouse is under constant surveillance by U.N. cameras.
	   The samples will be taken to European laboratories for testing,
Sullivan said. The tests are expected to last at least a month.
	   The tests were called after Iraq disputed the findings last
month of a U.S. laboratory that said it had found traces of VX on
Iraqi missile warheads.
	   The U.S. evidence contradicted Iraqi claims that it had never
loaded the gas into warheads.
	   Although the chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler said he
had no doubt of the findings, the United Nations agreed to take
samples for further testing in laboratories in France and
Switzerland.
	   The 15 U.N. arms experts, led by Horst Reeps of Germany, had
arrived in Baghdad on Sunday.
	   During their stay, they held talks with Iraqi scientists on the
scope of Iraq's work with VX, a gas so deadly that a few drops can
kill a person. Sullivan declined to comment on these discussions.
	   Iraq has admitted experimenting with VX, but denies it ever
deployed the gas in weapons.
	   U.N. Security Council diplomats have said the sanctions imposed
on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 will not be lifted until U.N.
arms monitors certify that Baghdad has eliminated all its weapons
of mass destruction.

Postal strike over
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ A strike that has crippled mail delivery
across India for more than a week ended Thursday after talks
between union leaders and the government, Press Trust of India
reported.
	   ``We called off the strike on the basis of mutual trust and
assurances given by the minister,'' R.L. Bhattacharya, general
secretary of the National Federation of Postal Employees, was
quoted as saying after two hours of talks with Communications
Minister Sushma Swaraj.
	   Few details were immediately available.
	   Even before Thursday's talks, the government had given in to the
union's central demand, raising the wages of most of the postal
workers to 3,050 rupees (dlrs 72) a month from 2,750 rupees (dlrs
65). The average annual per capita income in India, one of the
world's poorest countries, is about 1,500 rupees (dlrs 37) a month.
	   The final sticking point had been the demand for pensions for
300,000 so-called ``temporary'' workers, some of whom have been
employed for decades without contracts. The non-contract workers
were among the 650,000 strikers.
	   During the eight days of the strike, mail piled up in post
offices staffed by temporary workers, former workers recalled from
retirement and soldiers.

Georgians take over control of Abkhazia border from Russians

	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian border guards will replace
Russian troops patrolling the sea borders of breakaway Abkhazia, a
Georgian general said Thursday.
	   Abkhazia, a Black Sea province in northwestern Georgia, declared
independence in 1992. Separatists drove out Georgian troops and
ethnic Georgian civilians in a 13-month war.
	   The guard changeover, scheduled for Thursday night, is part of a
1994 agreement with Russia under which Russian troops have
patrolled Georgia's Black Sea borders, including the stretch
claimed by Abkhazia.
	   Russia has trained Georgia's border guards so that they could
eventually take over, Major Gen. Valery Chkheidze told national
television.
	   Leaders in Abkhazia oppose the switch, which they say will
strengthen Georgian control over the region and will intensify
their conflict with Georgia. They demand full control over the
border.
	   Georgian president Eduard Shevarnadze defended the decision on
Monday. ``The country that does not control its borders is an
inferior country,'' he said in a weekly radio address.
	   He said Abkhazia ``must understand that in the question of
borders Georgia acts on the basis of international conventions,
which are obligatory for all countries.''
	   Georgia and Abkhazia will continue consulting on the issue,
Chkheidze said. ``We are against any confrontation or greater
tension in the situation,'' he said.

Israeli businessman sentenced to 16 years for sales to Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL BEN-TAL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a high-profile treason case tinged
with scandal, an Israeli businessman was sentenced to 16 years in
prison on Thursday for selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   Judge Amnon Straschnov said the defendant, former paratrooper
Nachum Manbar, sacrificed Israel's security ``on the altar of
unfettered greed.'' Iran is one of Israel's most implacable foes.
	   Manbar, who faced life in prison, sat stone-faced as he heard
the decision. When he was walked out of Tel Aviv District Court,
Manbar shouted: ``There will be an appeal.''
	   Earlier this week, Manbar's lead defense attorney, Amnon
Zichroni, had alleged that Straschnov had secretly maintained a
``close, intensive'' relationship with Pninat Yanai, a female
member of the defense team who was eventually fired.
	   Straschnov has denied the allegations and rejected defense
demands that he withdraw from the case before passing sentence.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Manbar's conviction and sentence.
Despite his earlier charges against the judge, Zichroni was evasive
Thursday when asked whether he would make alleged improper judicial
conduct a key element of his appeal.
	   The story has dominated Israeli media since it broke Tuesday,
and at certain points also took on a political tinge.
	   It began with a legislator from the opposition Labor Party,
Nissim Zvili, calling for an investigation of allegations that
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the case with
Straschnov and tried to influence him. Zvili has since withdrawn
the demand, saying he accepted the judge's denial. Netanyahu has
also denied having had any contact with Straschnov.
	   On Thursday, the Haaretz daily quoted Netanyahu as saying
privately that his predecessors, Labor prime ministers Shimon Peres
and Yitzhak Rabin, had turned a blind eye to Manbar's activities
because of Manbar's ties to the Labor Party.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday denied having made such accusations and
said in a statement he found no fault with his predecessors'
behavior in the Manbar case.
	   Yossi Melman, a journalist who covers the intelligence services
for the Haaretz daily, said Manbar started out selling defensive
equipment, such as gas masks and gas detectors, to Iran with the
knowledge of the Israeli defense establishment in the early 1990s.
	   However, at some point Manbar allegedly began selling chemicals
that can be used both in agriculture and in making poison gas,
Melman said. Manbar was warned by Israeli intelligence in late 1993
to stop those sales, Melman said.
	   Manbar was not alone in selling to Iran, Melman said. In the
early 1990s, Israeli companies sold mortar shells and fertilizer
with the knowledge of the security establishment, he said.
	   A change came in 1994, when Mossad chief Shabtai Shavit said
Iran should be perceived as a strategic threat to Israel and urged
the government to change its policy accordingly, Melman said.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ In a high-profile treason case tinged
with scandal, an Israeli businessman was sentenced to 16 years in
prison on Thursday for selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   Judge Amnon Straschnov said the defendant, former paratrooper
Nachum Manbar, sacrificed Israel's security ``on the altar of
unfettered greed.'' Iran is one of Israel's most implacable foes.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was pleased with the
verdict, saying Manbar had committed ``heinous crimes'' by
supplying Iran with material ``to rain down chemical death on
Israel's cities _ on our citizens and children.''
	   Manbar, who faced life in prison, sat stone-faced as he heard
the decision. When he was walked out of Tel Aviv District Court,
Manbar shouted: ``There will be an appeal.''
	   Earlier this week, Manbar's lead defense attorney, Amnon

Zvili has since withdrawn the demand, saying he accepted the
judge's denial. Netanyahu also denied having had any contact with
Straschnov.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday accused the opposition of taking advantage
of the Manbar affair to raise ``baseless claims'' in order to
defame him and the integrity of Israel's justice system.
	   ``If I ever thought there was a limit to how low my opponents
were willing to go, it turns out I was wrong,'' he said.
	   Manbar's trial was held behind closed doors for security
reasons.
	   But Yossi Melman, a journalist who covers the intelligence
services for Haaretz, said Manbar started out selling defensive
equipment, such as gas masks and gas detectors, to Iran with the

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Retired Gurkha soldiers marched to the
British Embassy in Katmandu on Thursday to pressure their former
employer for pensions equal to those of their British counterparts.
	   Nearly 15,000 former Gurkha soldiers and their relatives marched
about two kilometers (just over a mile) from the Nepalese Foreign
Ministry to the embassy and blocked the building's entrance for an
hour.
	   A protest letter was handed over to embassy officials.
	   Himal Rai of the Gurkha Ex-Servicemen's Organization said
Gurkhas would begin a sit-in at the embassy on Aug. 17 that would
last ``until our demands are met.''
	   The organization had rejected a British Government's offer of
pensions hikes ranging from 23 to 51 percent for the 26,375 retired
Gurkha soldiers who have served and fought wars for Britain.
	   Even with a 40 percent increase, a retired Gurkha rifleman will
receive a pension of dlrs 42 a month; his British counterpart gets
dlrs 750 a month.
	   At present, 3,000 British Gurkhas are still on active duty.
Gurkha soldiers from Nepal have served in the British Army for
nearly 200 years.

Extended cargo ban to shave third of a percent off GDP

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Cargo shipment troubles at Hong Kong's new
airport could cost Hong Kong's economy more than a third of a
percent this year and considerably disrupt external trade, the
government said Thursday.
	   A statement said the protracted cargo delays could result in a
loss of about 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 589
million), or 0.35 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product
this year. The new estimate was higher than the 0.1 percent figure
given last week by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang.
	   ``The longer the disruption, the greater will be the likelihood
of trade being diverted elsewhere,'' the government said.
	   After a disastrous start at Hong Kong's new Chek Lap Kok
airport, which opened July 6, the territory's main cargo handler
froze nearly all cargo shipments until July 19.
	   Late Wednesday, it announced that it would not be able to bring
its facility at the new airport up to full speed until the end of
August.
	   Secretary for Trade and Industry Brian Chau said the cargo
limitations were unfair to small and medium businesses, the
backbone of Hong Kong's once-robust economy, especially at a time
when it is slipping into recession.
	   ``Like most Hong Kong people, I'm disappointed, and I'm angry,''
Chau told reporters. ``This shouldn't, and couldn't be happening.''
	   The company, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, ``should be
condemned,'' Chau said.
	   Legislator James Tien, chairman of the influential General
Chamber of Commerce, said some factories have been cutting
operating hours, and might have to lay off workers because of lack
of supplies from overseas.
	   Tien said manufacturers of toys and clothing would be the
hardest hit because August and September are their peak export
season.
	   Legislator Lee Cheuk-yan, secretary-general for the
Confederation of Trade Unions, said he worried that employers would
use this as an excuse to fire workers or cut wages during the
economic downturn.
	   Computer problems destroyed much of the handler's air cargo
data, forcing the closure.
	   Although the company largely has avoided finger-pointing, it
says it never promised to have the new site operating fully by
early July.
	   And the government has faced accusations that it pushed the
airport opening ahead too fast to coincide with the first
anniversary of the return to Chinese rule. Chinese President Jiang
Zemin visited on the anniversary, and dedicated the airport.
	   Air cargo shipments have resumed partially, and officials said
the new airport handled 2,437 tons of cargo Wednesday, about half
of normal. Passengers services are back to normal, officials said.
	   Hong Kong officials struck a deal Wednesday with the mainland
for airlines to use Huangtian airport in the bordering mainland
city of Shenzhen. Officials said Huangtian could handle up to 30
percent of the territory's usual cargo. Some airlines also have
been using the airport in the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau.
	   Kenny Ku, vice president of the Association of Small and Medium
Businesses and a toy and gifts trader, said most members would use
the mainland airports only as a last resort because of inefficiency
and customs procedures.
	   Some members have been shipping cargo by sea to airports in the
Middle East, Singapore and Japan before re-routing them to Europe
and the United States, he said.
	   Traders are advising overseas clients to stop exporting, and
banks are tightening credit because of delayed shipments, he said.
Some cargo was stuck in overseas ports because airmail shipping
documents from Hong Kong were lost, he said.
	   However, there was general agreement that if the present
problems are fixed, Hong Kong's efficiency, capacity and openness
would likely secure its place as the region's cargo hub.

Lisbon club Benfica fails to pay debts, faces penalties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Benfica missed deadlines for paying
overdue taxes and a loan instalment, leaving its accounts frozen
and taking the team closer to legal and sports sanctions, officials
said Thursday.
	   The Lisbon club failed to make a payment due Wednesday of about
140 million escudos (dlrs 765,000) on a loan from Finibanco, the
Lisbon-based bank said.
	   A Lisbon court froze all of Benfica's bank accounts in May
because of non-payment on the 600-million-escudo (dlrs 3.3 million)
loan. The payment due Wednesday was part of a deal to release money
in the accounts.
	   Finibanco said Thursday the accounts would remain frozen. Club
President Joao Vale e Azevedo has been paying club costs out of his
private account.
	   Meanwhile, government officials said the 30-time champion had
also failed to settle a first instalment of outstanding social
security payments by Wednesday's deadline.
	   The amount due was not given, but Benfica reportedly owes about
6 billion escudos (dlrs 33 million) in back taxes.
	   The payment was part of a deal between the government and the
country's soccer authorities for clubs to settle their tax debts.
	   The government has threatened unspecified sanctions if clubs do
not meet the first instalments by the end of July. The soccer
authorities have said that any club which does not meet the
deadline could be relegated to a lower division.
	   Phone calls to Benfica officials were not immediately returned.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's sons should not be forced to
become her ``shadows,'' the princess' mother says in a television
interview to be aired Thursday in the United States.
	   In the documentary ``The Real Diana,'' to be broadcast by Fox,
Frances Shand Kydd also says she spent the three nights before the
funeral among mourners outside Diana's Kensington Palace home,
drawing strength from their grief, according to a transcript
published in The Mirror newspaper.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd said her hope for Prince William, 16, and
Princce Harry, 13, was ``that they grow up to be themselves, that
they will literally become themselves, the natural process of
growing up.''
	   ``They want privacy in private times. I wouldn't want them to
be, or expect them to be, pointed in the direction of being a
shadow of their mother, because they are themselves,'' she said.
``My hopes are they have peace, love, affection and protection to
become themselves as adults.''
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd professed surprise at the mass grieving that
followed Diana's death Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash. ``There aren't
words to describe it and Diana above all would have had no concept
of what has happened because of her,'' she said.
	   She reaffirmed her faith in the French investigation of the
crash and said ``whatever the findings are I will accept them.''
	   Speaking in the library at the Spencer family's ancestral home,
Althorp House, she commended her son Charles, the 9th Earl Spencer,
for setting up a museum in memory of his sister.
	   The exhibition, which is open to the public for two months this
summer, is a personal tribute to the princess and includes
mementoes from her childhood and home video footage of the young
Diana.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd called it ``really quite simply, breathtaking''
and said some of the press coverage of it had been ``very harsh and
very hurtful at times.'' Some newspaper articles had accused
Spencer of profiting from his sister's death.
	   ``I had qualms about it, nerves about it, wondering how I'd
feel,'' Mrs. Shand Kydd told interviewer Cathy Crier. But, ``it is
beautiful. It just flows from beginning to end. It's very quiet,
poignant, powerful. It's very calm,'' she said.
	   She said her son may decide to change the exhibit, perhaps
annually, to show some of the mass of material that has
accumulated.
	   Several times, Mrs. Shand Kydd deflected probing personal
questions. And she abruptly ended the interview when Crier tried to
ask about the occasion last month when Mohamed Al Fayed, father of
Diana's boyfriend Dodi, who died in the car crash, called her a
snob and a poor mother.

New police chief wants law and order
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ Hungary's new police chief Peter Orban
Thursday vowed to transform the police force to become more
disciplined and efficient than before.
	   Orban, 50, was appointed by the center-right government of
Viktor Orban (no relation), who called fighting organized and
gangland crime a priority.
	   There has been a series of bombings and shootings in the country
in past years, the most recent and bloodiest of which killed four
people and injured 25 in downtown Budapest on July 2.
	   The target of that bombing, Tamas Boros, a known underworld
figure, had been a police informer and was a major threat to other
criminal gangs.
	   ``We have to be more careful in keeping secrets within the
police, because otherwise either our informers will turn away from
us, or will die,'' Orban said.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Three English rugby union players received
``severe cautions'' after testing positive for banned drugs
contained in medicines, the Rugby Football Union disciplinary
tribunal said Thursday.
	   Northampton's former England squad player Martin Hynes,
Bristol's Steve Pearce and Exeter's Richard Gibbons all admitted to
unknowingly taking banned substances.
	   Each player declared he was taking medication at the time of
testing.
	   Hynes tested positive for pseudoephedrine after a match against
Sale on Feb. 20 but said he had taken the decongestant Sudafed for
a chest infection.
	   Hynes' doctor confirmed Sudafed had been prescribed by him but
suspected the player was ignorant of the drug regulations.
	   Pearce gave a similar positive reading after taking Sudafed
before a game against London Irish in February.
	   He said he had been suffering from the symptoms of a heavy cold
and decided to take Sudafed to aid him to get to work.
	   Gibbons tested positive for ephedrine after taking the
medication Chesteze before a match in March.
	   Gibbons said he was an asthmatic and had been taking the tablets
for several years, which he obtained without needing a
prescription.

Austria seeks pledges from Europeans to shelter Kosovo refugees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Austrian politicians, background &QL; 
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria fears a rising tide of refugees
from Serbia's Kosovo province and will ask other European countries
to share the burden of caring for them, Interior Minister Karl
Schloegl said Thursday.
	   Schloegl spoke in an interview with Austrian state radio prior
to a meeting with interior ministers from Germany, Italy, France
and Switzerland in Gaschurn, western Austria.
	   Starting in 1956, when more than 200,000 people sought temporary
shelter following the Hungarian uprising against the Soviets,
Austria has been a haven for refugees.
	   It gave permanent shelter to tens of thousands of Czechs and
Poles following the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of then-Czechoslovakia
and the December 13, 1981, declaration of martial law in Communist
Poland.
	   More recently, thousands of refugees and human rights activists
from Turkey and non-European countries have been granted asylum in
Austria. But the Austrian government has toughened asylum laws and
placed army units at its eastern borders to curb the influx in the
last two years.
	   Tens of thousands have fled the fighting in Kosovo in recent
weeks, most of them arriving in northern Albania and in Montenegro,
the smaller republic in what is left of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
	   ``I fear that we are only at the beginning of the problem of
migration and a mass exodus from Kosovo,'' Schloegl said. ``If the
reports I have are correct there will be no letup in Kosovo.''
	   He said Austria would be overstrained by a major refugee
movement across its borders, adding the talks with his colleagues
were designed to help find a common answer to the problem.
	   ``Austria's capacities are exhausted,'' said Helene
Partik-Pable, a deputy of the rightist Freedom Party.
	   She called for a ban on Kosovo refugees, urging the government
to extend financial help to Hungary for the upkeep of the refugees.
	   Conversely, Terezija Stoisits, a deputy of the Greens, called
for a temporary residence permit for ``persecuted Albanians from
Kosovo.''
	   Mass migrations following armed conflicts such as in Kosovo
cannot be absorbed by one single country, Schloegl said in the
interview, and refugees _ and the costs of their upkeep _ should be
distributed among the 15 member countries of the European Union.
	   The minister made clear that Austria would not be in a position
to shelter as many refugees from Kosovo as from former Yugoslavia
during the Bosnian war when a total of 92,000 refugees arrived in
Austria _ the largest number per capita of the resident population
in any EU member country. Austria has a population of about eight
million.

New Israeli company to showcase made-in-settlements products

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A group of Israeli businessmen is starting a
company to sell products made in Jewish settlements in the West
Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights, in response to a threatened
European Union trade action against products made in the
settlements.
	   The company will open its first store next month in downtown
Jerusalem, and plans to open stores in Tel Aviv, Haifa and other
cities around the world, settler spokesman Aharon Dompa said
Thursday.
	   The store will sell everything from earrings and clothes to art
and wine, said company head Ilan Hirshfeld.
	   The company is named ``Yesha is Here, Inc.'' Yesha is the Hebrew
acronym for Judea and Samaria _ the Biblical names for the West
Bank _ and Gaza.
	   Hirshfeld said the idea of the company was conceived because he
got ``annoyed'' at the threatened European action against settlers'
products, which he said reminded him of the German boycott of
Jewish products 50 years ago.
	   The European Commission has charged that Israel is
misrepresenting exports from the settlements _ which are built on
land captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War _ as ``made in
Israel,'' thus gaining preferential duty-free customs treatment in
Europe. The commission is considering a proposal to remove
free-trade status from agricultural produce or manufactured goods
from the settlements.
	   The Europeans maintain that their free trade treaty with Israel
applies only to Israel inside its pre-1967 borders.

Serbian police bursts into ethnic Albanian headquarters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of spokeswoman in 11th graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian security forces for the
first time ever surrounded and burst into the downtown headquarters
of Kosovo's ruling party Thursday, moments after ethnic Albanian
separatists constituted their clandestine parliament.
	   There was no official Serb explanation for the 30-minute action
by some 20 heavily-armed riot policemen and 10 plainclothes
officers, who entered the drab-looking makeshift building in the
heart of Kosovo's capital.
	   They impounded all written documents from the first session of
the clandestine ethnic Albanian parliament, which is considered
illegal by the Serbian authorities.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who compromise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million people, held their elections on March 22 for the 120-seat
self-styled parliament and the president.
	   Thursday's was the first visible action by the Serb forces in
the area of the ruling Democratic League of Kosovo party
headquarters, which also house the office of their leader, Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   Rugova was inside the building when the plainclothes policemen
stormed in.
	   ``The police action wasn't brutal, but it was very swift,'' said
Nekibe Kelmendi, the general secretary of the ruling LDK party,
which holds 90 percent of seats in the new parliament.
	   ``They gave us a two-minute ultimatum to hand them the documents
from the constitutional session, which we did,'' she added.
	   There were no violence or arrests, and the police, armed with
machine-guns and riot gear, withdrew after about 30 minutes.
	   During the unannounced session, Rugova gave his presidential
oath, saying he ``will use all his powers for the formation and
preservation of an independent Republic of Kosovo.''
	   Kelmendi said the formation of the Kosovo parliament was ``a
historic act and the result of a new reality in the region which
the international community will have to consider.''

Rangers-Shelbourne to play on neutral ground
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BIRKENHEAD, England (AP) _ Next week's UEFA Cup game between
Dublin side Shelbourne and Scottish team Glasgow Rangers will be
played at Tranmere, a neutral ground near Liverpool in England.
	   Wednesday's first-round qualifying match was originally
scheduled to be played at Dublin's Tolka Park stadium but was
called off due to fears of sectarian violence.
	   The game was rescheduled by UEFA Thursday to Tranmere's
16,700-capacity Prenton Park stadium, Birkenhead.
	   The Dublin club was reportedly worried about the possibility of
violence if Rangers' fans from Northern Ireland's Protestant
community traveled south for the game.
	   Fourteen years ago, when Rangers last played a European cup
match in Dublin, against the Bohemians Club, there were clashes
between local fans, Protestants and Irish police.

Thai corporate income tax payments up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thanks to steady earnings from
companies operating outside the capital, Thai corporate income tax
payments for the first nine months of fiscal 1998 were 25.45
percent higher than in the same period a year earlier, the Finance
Ministry said Thursday.
	   The ministry reported payments of 77.62 billion baht (dlrs 1.94
billion) for the nine months.
	   Companies in provincial areas are generally doing well despite
the economic crisis because they did not take on as much foreign
debt as their more ambitious counterparts in Bangkok, a ministry
spokesman said.
	   The fall in the value of the baht last year increased the debt
burden of companies that borrowed offshore.
	   Corporate taxes paid in June totaled 16.18 billion baht (dlrs
404.5 million), an increase of 23.49 percent from June last year.
	   ``Revenue from listed companies and financial institutions is no
longer expected,'' spokeswoman Paithoon Pongkasorn was quoted as
saying by the newspaper The Nation.
	   The finance sector was especially hard hit by the crisis, and
many listed companies took on large amounts of dollar-denominated
debt.

Philippine National Oil Co. considering sale of Petron shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine National Oil Co. is
considering selling about half of its remaining 40 percent stake in
Petron Corp., the country's biggest oil refiner.
	   Energy Secretary and PNOC Chairman Mario Tiaoqui said Thursday
the move is under consideration as a means of raising funds for
government coffers.
	   ``We have to look at all areas of privatizations ... and its
strategic implications,'' Tiaoqui said.
	   Five years ago, PNOC sold a 40 percent shareholding in Petron to
Saudi Armaco for dlrs 450 million, and another 20 percent was
divested through an initial public offering.
	   Tiaoqui said, however, that PNOC would not shed all its
remaining stake in Petron for strategic reasons.
	   The government sorely needs funds to cut a budget deficit that
it fears could stretch to 70 billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion) this
year unless greater revenues are raised. A small budget surplus was
posted in 1997.
	   Petron's share of the Philippine oil market in 1997 was 42.7
percent. A legal battle that stalled deregulation of the oil
industry _ and resulted in a temporary freeze on price increases _
caused Petron to post a net loss of 631 million pesos (dlrs 15.4
million) in 1997.

Ukraine's president calls for budget passage, makes gloomy
</HEADLINE>
warnings &QL; 
 &UR; By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma Thursday repeated
his call for Ukraine's parliament to approve the revised 1998
budget to avert a financial catastrophe that he said was awaiting
Ukraine.
	   ``We must convince the legislators that there is no other
alternative,'' Kuchma said during a visit to the eastern industrial
and coal-producing city of Donetsk.
	   The government has already approved a cut in the budget deficit
to 2.3 percent of gross domestic product _ a major condition of the
International Monetary Fund for approving a long-negotiated dlrs
2.5 billion loan for Ukraine.
	   But the new Verkhovna Rada, or parliament, has been occupied
with political infighting and the election of a speaker since it
convened in mid-May.
	   The new speaker, leftist Olexander Tkachenko, has called the
government's revised budget realistic, but other influential
leftists and Communists in parliament oppose planned spending cuts,
especially those in social subsidies.
	   Kuchma argued that the adoption of the new budget would persuade
the IMF to approve the loan, which it refused to do last year due
to Kiev's stalled economic reforms. An IMF mission is expected in
Kiev next week to discuss the loan.
	   That approval, in turn, would ``immediately clear the road'' for
foreign investors and improve Ukraine's credit rating, Kuchma said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Kuchma warned parliament that Ukraine was facing a financial
catastrophe, with budget revenues consistently short of targets and
insufficient to cover the former Soviet republic's debts.
	   In June, Finance Ministry figures showed budget revenues at 785
million hryvna (dlrs 392.5 million), instead of the planned 960
million hryvna (dlrs 480 million).
	   ``We can get the money only on external markets,'' Kuchma said.
``But nobody would give it to us, in view of Ukraine's current
state of economy.''
	   Kuchma met in Donetsk with the leaders of the metallurgic
industry and lamented the continuing decline in its output _ 5.7
percent in June and 1.5 percent total for the first half of 1998.
	   ``There is no strategic line in managing the industry,'' he
said.
	   Output also fell in such key areas as energy production,
petrochemical, chemical and machine-building industries, according
to the State Statistics Committee.
	   However, overall industrial output in various areas grew by up
to nearly 2 percent in the first half of 1998 from the same period
last year, the committee said Thursday.

Liechtenstein reports first-ever BSE case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) _ The tiny alpine principality of
Liechtenstein on Thursday reported its first case of mad cow
disease.
	   A 4 1/2-year-old cow at a breeding operation was tested after
showing symptoms linked to the disease, the government's
information office said.
	   The rest of the herd will be slaughtered in the next few days,
and measures have been taken to ensure no products from the
operation are put on the market.
	   The animal was born long after a ban on the use of animal
remains in cattle feed ban was imposed in Switzerland and
Liechtenstein in 1990. The two countries work together in several
areas.
	   Switzerland has had 274 cases of mad cow disease, six so far
this year. The total is the second-highest after that of Britain,
which has had more than 171,900 cases.
	   Mad cow disease, formally known as bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, or BSE, is a fatal brain-wasting affliction that
scientists believe may be passed on to humans in the new variant of
the human equivalent, Creutzfeldt Jakob disease.

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch police said Thursday they
are investigating an international ring that is spreading child
pornography on the Internet.
	   The ring, which operates mainly out of Berlin, peddles
pornographic material sometimes involving children aged less than
two years, the respected Dutch current affairs program NOVA
reported.
	   Computer discs containing thousands of ``very shocking'' photos
were discovered in the apartment of a ring member in the coastal
Dutch town of Zandvoort.
	   The owner of the apartment was recently murdered in Italy by a
fellow gang member.
	   One Dutch child psychologist told NOVA the material was the
worst he had ever seen.
	   It was the Belgian anti-pornography group Morkhoeven that
tracked down the Zandvoort address and seized the materials,
according to the German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost.
	   Regional police spokesman Jaap Hage declined comment on the
case, saying an investigation is still in progress. No arrests have
been made, he added.

Rift emerges in ruling coalition as Howard vows to pursue tax
</HEADLINE>
reform &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard faced down
a potential split in Australia's ruling conservative coalition
Thursday, vowing to push ``full steam ahead'' with his plan for
radical tax reform, to be announced before a looming election.
	   Howard said the Asian economic downturn made an overhaul of
Australia's tax system even more urgent. Don McDonald, president of
the junior coalition partner, the National Party, had called for
tax reform to be delayed until the Asian crisis has passed.
	   ``We will go ahead with tax reform, full steam ahead, there'll
be no change,'' Howard said in Adelaide Thursday.
	   ``Because there is an Asian economic downturn, that makes it all
the more important to have tax reform in this country and there's
no way on earth that the government is going to back off tax
reform, no way on earth.''
	   McDonald, in a letter to Nationals leader and Deputy Prime
Minister Tim Fischer reported Thursday in the newspaper Herald-Sun,
said party members would not guarantee support to Howard's package
of tax reforms.
	   Howard has said the package, which would introduce a broad-based
consumption tax in Australia, is close to completion but he has not
given a date for its public release.
	   The unveiling of the package is a strong indicator that national
elections are soon to follow.
	   Speculation is high that Howard will call an election within
months; he is required to do so before May 1999.
	   But a split may be emerging in the Liberal-National coalition as
fear grows among members of the rural-based Nationals that a
so-called ``goods and services'' tax will be hard to sell to voters
in country regions.
	   Many National Party lawmakers are also opposed to Howard's plan
to sell the government's remaining two-thirds stake in the national
telecommunications carrier, Telstra Corp. The sale is crucial to
provide funds for spending promises Howard has already made.
	   Bob Katter, a National Party lawmaker from Queensland state,
said the proposed tax discriminated against people living far away
from ports in big cities.
	   ``The GST is a classic example of a government absolutely
determined to keep walking down into the valley of death,'' Katter
said in a radio interview.
	   ``I've got news for the prime minister _ the days of the English
Light Brigade are over.''
	   He said all National Party members should ask themselves whether
it was time for the party to break from the coalition.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The bones of Russia's last czar
were flown Thursday to the country's old imperial capital and
readied for burial, 80 years after the monarch was forced into
Siberian exile and executed.
	   The burial of Nicholas II and his family, set for Friday, was
intended as a healing gesture and an act of repentance for the
abuses of the communist era. But it's been mired in controversy as
politicians and religious leaders argued over how to handle the
service.
	   In a surprise development Thursday, President Boris Yeltsin
changed his mind and announced he would attend Friday's service.
The president had been planning to skip the ceremony because it had
become so contentious.
	   ``The truth (about the executions) was concealed for 80 years,''
Yeltsin said. ``I was told nothing. And tomorrow, the truth should
be told, and I should take part.''
	   Nicholas abdicated in 1917 amid rising political tensions, and
spent the next several months at a palace just outside St.
Petersburg. But the Bolsheviks then sent him to Siberia and
executed him and his family on July 17, 1918 _ 80 years ago Friday.
	   Their bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg and remained there until
they were unearthed in 1991.
	   Before being flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday, the bones,
sealed inside nine small coffins, were taken from a morgue to a
hilltop church in Yekaterinburg for a three-hour public service.
	   Hundreds of Russians knelt to pray, and some wept, as they
viewed coffins at the Ascension of the Lord Church.
	   ``I have come to pay a last tribute to the innocent victims,''
said a tearful Vera Kolchina, 74. ``Their deaths were a tragic part
of our history.''
	   About 1,000 people visited the church, which was just up the
hill from the house where Nicholas and his family were executed.
The infamous house was torn down two decades ago under the
supervision of the local Communist Party boss at the time _
Yeltsin.
	   Immediately following the church service, an honor guard carried
the coffins out of the church and they were flown to St. Petersburg
on an Aeroflot cargo jet.
	   There, the coffins were loaded into black funeral vans and
driven in a long procession through the streets of the old capital,
slowing poignantly as they passed the Winter Palace, the czar's
official residence.
	   Spectators lined up four deep on the sidewalk, and mostly
watched in silence as the cortege passed. At the end of the route,
military pallbearers took the coffins from the vans and carried
them, slowly and stiffly, into the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral,
resting place of czars since Peter the Great.
	   Russians have decidedly mixed feelings about the last czar. Some
view him as a despot, others consider him a martyr, and there are
those who believe he was simply a weak, indecisive ruler
overwhelmed by the tides of history. Some found themselves
inexplicably moved by the funeral procession.
	   ``I cried,'' said Lyuba Novikova, who stood at the entrance of
the Peter and Paul Fortress, near the cathedral where the remains
will be buried. She had brought her daughter to watch.
	   ``I'm a simple person,'' she added. ``I can't say why, but I
cried. It was like a shadow over us, and now we hope things will be
better for Russia.''
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, three of their
five children and four servants.
	   The coffins of the czar and czarina are draped with the yellow
flag of the Romanov family.
	   The other two children, the only son Alexei and a daughter the
scientists believe is Maria, were executed along with the entire
family. But their remains have not been found and most
investigators believe the bodies were burned to ashes.
	   There's long been a myth that one daughter, Anastasia, survived
the shooting and escaped. But scientific tests indicate her bones
are among the remains and those of her sister Maria are missing.
	   Extensive DNA testing in the United States, Britain and Russia
convinced scientists of the authenticity of the remains. But the
Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept the results, and top
church officials were not at the services, though local priests
were officiating.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad arrived in France
Thursday for the first time in 22 years, a rare Western visit that
could mean a higher profile for Europe in the Middle East peace
process, and for Syria on the world stage.
	   Assad's visit also aims to pull Syria out of its diplomatic and
economic isolation. It comes two months after Damascus began
negotiations for an association accord with the European Union.
	   President Jacques Chirac met Assad on his arrival at Orly
airport Thursday afternoon, Radio France Info reported. Talks were
scheduled to begin two hours later.

Report: Pope not welcome in Romania because of church conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with statement from Holy Synod. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Pope John Paul II may not be welcome
in Romania because of a conflict between Eastern Rite Catholics and
the majority Orthodox Church over church property, a newspaper
reported Thursday.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile recently invited the pope when he was
visiting the Vatican. The invitation reportedly had the oral
blessing of Patriarch Teoctist, the head of the Orthodox Church.
	   Government spokesman Tudor Anghel called the church's apparent
change of mind ``speculation.''
	   The daily Libertatea reported the Holy Synod of the Romanian
Orthodox Church decided Wednesday not to invite the pontiff until
``divergencies'' were resolved between the two churches.
	   In a statement released Thursday, the Holy Synod said the pope's
visit should take place after relations between the Orthodox Church
and the Vatican have been ``improved by dialogue.''

Hong Kong's January-June tourism down 21 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With visits from major Asian countries such as
Japan and South Korea down at least by half, Hong Kong registered a
21 percent drop in tourism in this year's first six months.
	   Overall, the Tourist Association said in a statement Thursday,
it expected arrivals to be down 6 percent this year, totaling fewer
than 10 million.
	   Tourism is one pillar of the Hong Kong economy, accounting for
thousands of jobs. With the economic downturn in Asia cutting into
tourism, hundreds of retail, restaurant and hotel workers have lost
employment.
	   That has contributed to Hong Kong's own economic downturn. The
territory has slid into recession. Unemployment is 4.2 percent, a
15-year high, and growing.
	   The Tourist Association said arrivals from Japan were down 50.1
percent and from South Korea down 60.7 percent in the first half of
the year, compared to January-June last year.
	   Australia, New Zealand and South Asia were among the few markets
that were growing.
	   Officials reported a 70 percent increase in arrivals from
mainland China in June, but said that was mostly due to the small
number of arrivals in 1997. Travel restrictions to Hong Kong were
imposed last year around the time of the July 1 handover to Chinese
rule.
	   Total tourist arrivals in June were almost 750,000, a drop of
5.4 percent from a year earlier.

British business warns of `manufacturing meltdown'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British manufacturers and exporters are taking the
hardest hits to their businesses since the last recession,
according to an influential survey that warned Thursday of a
``manufacturing meltdown.''
	   Making matters worse, the service sector is also spinning into a
rapid decline, with plunging business confidence and fears about
interest rates and exchange rates aggravating the outlook, the
British Chambers of Commerce said.
	   ``The knock-on effects of the decline in manufacturing are now
beginning to show through in the service sector and, given the
gravity of today's results, business failures and job losses are
now a certainty,'' said Ian Peters, deputy director-general of the
chambers.
	   Britain's exporters have been hammered by the high value of the
pound, which has gained strength from six interest rate increases
since the Labor government of Prime Minister Tony Blair took office
in May 1997. The high pound has made British products less
competitive overseas.
	   Business leaders have been clamoring for a cut in interest
rates, but the Bank of England has been instructed by the
government to set interest rates at a level that will keep
inflation under control.
	   Despite a big drop in underlying inflation last month, Britain
is still missing the official target of 2.5 percent annually.
	   Peters warned that if interest rates don't go down, Britain
might be heading for troubles similar to the early 1990s recession
that stretched into the nation's longest economic downturn since
World War II.
	   The quarterly Chambers of Commerce survey _ which is
non-scientific but quite comprehensive as it included responses
from 9,120 businesses _ found export sales and orders at their
lowest levels since the report was first conducted in 1985.
	   Meanwhile, home sales and orders have sunk to levels unseen
since the last recession, which according to the Bank of England
began in late 1990 and bottomed out in early 1992.
	   In the service sector, businesses are showing zero sales growth
as orders have plunged to their lowest levels in six years, the
survey found.
	   ``We're concerned at the pace at which the manufacturing sector
has slowed,'' said Andrew Parkinson, a spokesman for the chambers.
``The next three months don't look good, either.''

Heroin seizures rise dramatically in Sweden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Heroin seizures in Sweden in the first
six months of the year were more than 300 percent higher than in
the entire previous year, a national police official said Thursday.
	   Walter Kegoe, head of the criminal intelligence service's
narcotics division, said 65 kilograms (134 pounds) of heroin was
seized so far this year, compared with 14 kilograms (31 pounds) in
1997, according to the Swedish news agency TT.
	   Much of the heroin smuggling into Sweden is organized by Kosovo
Albanians, who are suspected of funneling profits to the rebels
fighting for the province's independence from Yugoslavia, Kegoe
said.
	   ``What we know is that a good deal of money goes down to Kosovo
that originates with criminal operations directed by Kosovo
Albanians,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We have information that
indicates some of the money is used in the independence fight, but
we can't prove that absolutely.''
	   Kegoe also said the increased heroin seizures reflected in part
improved training for police and customs agents.

Yemen accuses Saudi of occupying disputed border areas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemen on Thursday accused Saudi Arabia of
occupying disputed border areas between the two countries.
	   ``Saudi Arabia continues to occupy Yemeni lands in a policy of
... putting pressure on Yemen,'' said a government statement
distributed to reporters.
	   Large swaths of the 2,000-kilometer (1,300-mile) frontier
between the two countries remain undefined, and the decades-old
dispute over the boundary has often flared into armed
confrontation.
	   The statement also criticized Saudi Arabia for protesting a
border accord between Oman and Yemen. It said such a reaction will
only hurt ongoing negotiations between Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
	   News reports say that Saudi Arabia has lodged a formal protest
to the Arab League concerning the Oman-Yemen agreement, saying the
pact seeks to incorporate Saudi land.
	   The Yemeni statement said the government rejected the Saudi
objection, ``which is based on false claims and which hurts
relations between the two brotherly nations and stability in the
region.''
	   ``This type of action represents a dangerous setback to current
border negotiations ... and is not based on legal or historical
fact,'' it said.
	   Yemen has long contested Saudi Arabia's claim to parts of the
Rub al-Khali, a vast desert region believed to be rich in oil. It
accuses Saudi Arabia of building roads and constructing military
posts on its territory, and occupying tiny but strategic disputed
islands in the Red Sea.
	   Yemen has been frustrated by the lack of progress in border
talks and has said it will consider seeking international
arbitration.

UK farm leader sees end of beef export ban in autumn
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The leader of the National Farmers'
Union of England and Wales predicted Thursday that the European
Union will ease the ban on British beef exports this fall.
	   NFU President Ben Gill said he expects EU countries to allow the
export of beef from British cattle born after Aug. 1, 1996 within
months.
	   ``I see no reason why we shouldn't have an agreement by autumn
1998,'' Gill said.
	   Gill said EU countries have no justification for opposing the
date-based British beef export plan proposed last month by the EU
Commission.
	   The proposal followed a Commission decision in May to allow the
export from June 1 of beef from Northern Ireland certified to be
free of mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy.
	   Gill said Britain has met all EU-imposed conditions for a
further easing of the ban, imposed in March 1996 after Britain
announced a possible link between BSE and a fatal brain ailment in
humans.
	   The conditions include the removal of BSE ``risk material'' from
cattle carcasses, the slaughter of animals deemed at risk of
harboring BSE, the introduction of stricter animal feed controls
and the creation of an improved cattle identification system.
	   ``The rigorous measures in place mean that the time has come for
the next stage in the lifting of the ban on exports of British
beef,'' Gill said.
	   The plan is being examined by EU member-country veterinary
officials. It must be endorsed either by the veterinary officials
or by E.U. agriculture ministers.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The World Bank has awarded long-term loans
totaling dlrs 142 million to Egypt for four development projects.
	   In a fax received in Cairo Thursday, the bank said the loans had
a maturity of 20 to 35 years and grace periods of five to 10 years.
	   The projects are intended to improve agricultural output in the
Nile Delta, reduce pollution in Cairo and three other cities,
upgrade harbor and health services.

	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait Stock Exchange has started to recover
from weeks of slow trading, the National Investments Co. said
Thursday.
	   The exchange's price index closed at 2,127.3 points at the end
of this trading week, up 99.1 points, or 4.89 percent from last
week, the company said in a weekly report.
	   The improvement was prompted by a government proposal to amend a
1993 law that schedules how billions of dinars in bad debts owed by
private investors should be paid to the government, the report
said.
	   If approved by parliament, the amendment would extend the
deadline for the last two payments to March 1999 and March 2000,
and many debtors will not have to liquidate their stocks in order
to pay their dues.
	   The 6.7 billion dinar (dlrs 21.89 billion) debts were incurred
in a 1982 stock exchange crash and during the Iraqi occupation of
Kuwait that ended in March 1991. The Central Bank took over the
debts from private banks after the liberation.
	   The National Investments Co. said some 321.42 million shares
were traded this week, up by 212.68 million shares or 195.59
percent from the week before. The value of these shares also rose
by 161.35 percent to 70.50 million dinars (dlrs 230.39 million)
from 26.97 million dinars (dlrs 88.13 million).
	   Of 75 companies listed on the exchange, 65 were traded, with 47
closing higher, 6 closing lower, and 12 remaining the same.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices and turnover increased on the
Jordanian Stock Exchange this week, a market report said Thursday.
	   Brokers said the market's liveliness during the week was due to
a rush by foreign to purchase commercial bank shares.
	   The market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said that 60-company general share prices index
rose by 2.22 percent to 178.82 points.
	   Shares of commercial banks nudged up by 4.95 percent, insurance
sector by 1.30 percent, but those of industrial firms declined by
3.52 percent and the services sector by 0.97 percent.
	   Turnover increased by 292 percent to 22.42 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 31.6 million), the report said.
	   Stocks of 103 firms were traded during the week.

U.N. experts leave Iraq with 80 samples for VX tests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. arms experts left Baghdad Thursday
with 80 samples of missile warheads that will be tested for traces
of the deadly VX gas, a U.N. spokeswoman said.
	   Janet Sullivan said the samples were taken from a warehouse in
the military camp of Taji, north of Baghdad, where the United
Nations keeps parts of missiles it has retrieved from a disposal
site. The warehouse is under constant surveillance by U.N. cameras.
	   The samples will be taken to European laboratories for testing,
Sullivan said. The tests are expected to last at least a month.
	   The tests were called after Iraq disputed the findings last
month of a U.S. laboratory that said it had found traces of VX on
Iraqi missile warheads.
	   The U.S. evidence contradicted Iraqi claims that it had never
loaded the gas into warheads.
	   Although the chief U.N. arms inspector Richard Butler said he
had no doubt of the findings, the United Nations agreed to take
samples for further testing in laboratories in France and
Switzerland.
	   The 15 U.N. arms experts, led by Horst Reeps of Germany, had
arrived in Baghdad on Sunday.
	   During their stay, they held talks with Iraqi scientists on the
scope of Iraq's work with VX, a gas so deadly that a few drops can
kill a person. Sullivan declined to comment on these discussions.
	   Iraq has admitted experimenting with VX, but denies it ever
deployed the gas in weapons.
	   U.N. Security Council diplomats have said the sanctions imposed
on Iraq for invading Kuwait in 1990 will not be lifted until U.N.
arms monitors certify that Baghdad has eliminated all its weapons
of mass destruction.

New modern art museum in Munich nears completion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo MUN102 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ Bavarian officials celebrated a
topping-off ceremony Thursday for a new museum that will unite
collections of modern art, architecture, design and graphic art
under one roof.
	   The Pinakothek of the Modern, to open in 2000, stands next two
Munich's two other great art galleries, the Old and New
Pinakotheks, which house collections of art ranging from the 13th
to 19th centuries.
	   The new, 200 million mark (dlrs 115 million) museum was financed
primarily by the Bavarian government with the proceeds from
privatizations. Ten percent of the cost was raised by a private
foundation.
	   The museum's 4,800 square meters (more than one acre) of display
space will bring together works now housed at three other museums,
including Picasso's ``Sitting Woman'' from 1941 and the world's
biggest collection of paintings by expressionist Max Beckmann.

Collymore loses sponsorship deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: adds Collymore's agent reax last five grafs

<TEXT>
	   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) _ Sportswear company Diadora has
terminated its 2.5 million-pound (dlrs 4.1 million) sponsorship
contract with troubled Aston Villa soccer star Stan Collymore.
	   The former England international was widely condemned after
attacking his Swedish-born television presenter girlfriend Ulrika
Jonsson in a Paris bar on the eve of the opening game of the World
Cup.
	   Diadora UK released a statement Thursday saying Collymore had
not complied with certain contractual obligations and left the
company with no alternative but to terminate the deal immediately.
	   Diadora managing director Andrew Ronnie responded immediately
after the incident in Paris by saying he was ``amazed'' by
Collymore's actions.
	   ``We were very surprised by what Stan did. We pay him a
substantial amount of money,'' Ronnie said. ``He has always been
very pleasant to work with and a nice guy _ we are amazed.''
	   The Birmingham press reported huge public backlash against
Collymore after the attack on Jonsson, who immediately broke off
their relationship.
	   The 27-year-old striker reported back to Aston Villa for
pre-season training last week saying he would be a hero again if he
could score goals.
	   Collymore only scored eight goals last season after joining
Villa for 7 millions pounds (dlrs 11.62 million) from Liverpool in
May 1997.
	   A spokesman for Collymore's management company said Diadora's
decision to terminate the sponsorship was not necessarily a result
of Collymore's attack on Jonsson.
	   ``Of course we are deeply saddened that Diadora feel that they
have to take such action, but in fairness if you are going to
accept large quantities of money from sponsors then quite rightly
you have to accept the responsibility that goes along with it,''
the spokesman said.
	   ``It doesn't take a genius to realise that Stan could have done
without this development.
	   ``It is important that Stan concentrates on re-establishing
himself as one of the country's top strikers.''
	   Collymore's management company said it would be reviewing the
termination clauses within the Diadora contract to assess the
validity of the termination.

Philippine National Oil Co. considering sale of Petron shares
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The Philippine National Oil Co. is
considering selling about half of its remaining 40 percent stake in
Petron Corp., the country's biggest oil refiner.
	   Energy Secretary and PNOC Chairman Mario Tiaoqui said Thursday
the move is under consideration as a means of raising funds for
government coffers.
	   ``We have to look at all areas of privatizations ... and its
strategic implications,'' Tiaoqui said.
	   Five years ago, PNOC sold a 40 percent shareholding in Petron to
Saudi Armaco for dlrs 450 million, and another 20 percent was
divested through an initial public offering.
	   Tiaoqui said, however, that PNOC would not shed all its
remaining stake in Petron for strategic reasons.
	   The government sorely needs funds to cut a budget deficit that
it fears could stretch to 70 billion pesos (dlrs 1.7 billion) this
year unless greater revenues are raised. A small budget surplus was
posted in 1997.
	   Petron's share of the Philippine oil market in 1997 was 42.7
percent. A legal battle that stalled deregulation of the oil
industry _ and resulted in a temporary freeze on price increases _
caused Petron to post a net loss of 631 million pesos (dlrs 15.4
million) in 1997.

Woods in hunt as British Open begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with early leaders &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods took advantage of his
length and hot putter Thursday to shoot a 5-under 65 and tie John
Huston for the early lead in the British Open.
	   Woods, looking to contend in a major for the first time since
winning the Masters, nearly drove the 411-yard (375-meter) ninth
hole and reached the only two par-5s on the course with irons on
his second shot. But the putter, which has betrayed him in recent
major championships, may have been the key on a warm and nearly
windless day at Royal Birkdale.
	   Woods would have had the early lead to himself, but his 5-foot
(1 1/2-meter) par putt on the final hole hit the left lip and
kicked out. It was a rare mistake on a day where he made seven
birdies against two bogeys.
	   Woods, who made four birdie putts within 12 feet (3 1/2 meters)
on the front side, sank a curling 35-footer (10 1/2-meter) on the
13th hole to offset a bogey a hole earlier. He then birdied the
par-5 15th and 17th holes before closing with the bogey 5.
	   With more than half the field still out on a course that played
much simpler than expected because of the fair weather, Woods and
Huston were a shot better than 1994 Open winner Nick Price in the
opening round.
	   Another shot back at 67 were Brad Faxon and Sweden's Fredrik
Jacobson.
	   Woods played nearly perfect golf on the front side, taking
advantage of light winds and soft greens that tamed the links on
the Irish Sea. He moved into the lead with a 3-foot (1-meter)
birdie after chipping to the ninth green, and had three more
birdies on the back nine.
	   At the par-3 12th, Woods misclubbed and hit the ball over the
green. He chipped to within 2-feet (1/1 meter), but lipped out his
par putt.
	   Woods, whose putter kept him from contending in the U.S. Open
and the Masters this year, hasn't won a major since the 1997
Masters and has won only once on the PGA Tour this year, in the
BellSouth Classic.
	   But he insisted coming into the Open that he was striking the
ball well, and he showed it with some long drives and precise irons
before a massive gallery that cheered every shot.
	   Jacobson, playing in the first group of the day, used an eagle
on the par-5 17th to take the early clubhouse lead.
	   It didn't last long, though, as Huston made a 40-footer
(12-meter) for eagle on the 17th hole, then hit a spectacular shot
out of the deep rough on the final hole that hopped up on the green
and rolled to within 3-feet (1-meter) of the hole for a finishing
birdie and a 5-under 65.
	   Huston, who had to use a special career money winning exemption
to play on the PGA tour this year, credited magnets in his bed and
in the insole of his shoes for helping relieve tendinitis and
bursitis and allow him to play nearly pain-free again.
	   ``Last year, pretty much every day I would get up and wouldn't
feel very strong, kind of achey,'' Huston said. ``I didn't look
forward to going to the golf course, and it showed.''
	   While Huston was having his best day in five Opens, it was Woods
who thrilled the crowd on a day when overcast skies and little wind
helped the field throw high iron shots at the pins without fear of
the tall meadow rye rough.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, meanwhile, teased his fans with
two early birdies but may have shot himself out of yet another Open
in the first round with a 40 on the back for a 3-over 73.
	   England's Lee Westwood, who along with David Duval had been one
of the young favorites, also got off to a shaky start with two
bogeys on the front nine. Westwood had to birdie the 16th and 17th
to finish at 1-over 71, while Duval bogeyed the first hole and was
1-over through seven.
	   Neither Duval nor Westwood has won a major, but both have been
dominant players in the last year. Westwood in particular is on a
roll, having won seven times on four continents in the last nine
months, including three of his last four tournaments.
	   And both show no fear if it comes to a Sunday showdown.
	   ``I'm not afraid to win, so if I do get the opportunity I hope
to take it,'' said the 25-year-old Westwood, who has surpassed Nick
Faldo and Montgomerie as England's best hope.
	   Duval, who came tantalizingly close in the Masters and has three
wins in the past year, is equally as confident.
	   ``If your time comes, your time comes and you've got to play
through it and seize the opportunity,'' Duval said.
	   Leonard and Woods have both done just that, with Woods winning
the Masters last year and Leonard coming from behind in the final
round at Troon last year to take the Open title.
	   Woods, despite not having contended since the Masters, has the
length to contend with the windswept 7,018-yard (6,414-meter)
par-70 Birkdale. He not only hits it long, but has the power to rip
the ball out of the deep meadow rye that has encroached even
further on the fairways than the last time the Open was here in
1991.
	   ``I think I have a chance in each and every major,'' Woods said
earlier. ``You've got to be hitting on all cylinders in order to
win. Every facet of your game has to be good in order to win a
major.''
	   Tom Watson, who won five Opens, has no doubt Woods will win,
whether this year or in the future.
	   ``Tiger Woods is going to win a British Open, there is not a
question,'' Watson said. ``He has the length and the power and he
will win one.''
	   Tom Lehman, who won in 1996, had a late tee time but still
planned to play despite injuring his right shoulder at a local
amusement park on Tuesday.
	   ``I'll definitely be OK,'' Lehman said. ``I was just messing
around with the kids.''
	   No matter who contends this week, though, the eighth Open held
in this town on the Irish Sea will mark the passing of an era.
	   Jack Nicklaus made sure of that when he announced earlier this
month that he would skip Birkdale, ending his remarkable streak of
major tournaments at 146.
	   ``He skyrocketed the game, put a level of expectation on all of
us trying to achieve,'' Woods said. ``Like Michael Jordan has done
for basketball, he has put the bar so high, it is really neat you
can compare yourself to him.''

Republicans likely to approve full funding for IMF, majority leader
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Republican leader predicting
administration may get dlrs 18 billion, editing throughout to
tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM RAUM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The House of Representatives is likely to
approve the Clinton administration's long-delayed request for dlrs
18 billion for the International Monetary Fund now that the Asian
financial crisis and a new loan to Russia have depleted its
resources.
	   Majority Leader Richard Armey predicted the full amount
eventually would be approved after initial indications Republicans
would allocate only dlrs 3.5 billion for a new IMF emergency fund
and delay action on dlrs 14 billion for the organization's main
account.
	   ``In the end I suppose they (the IMF) will get pretty much get
as much money as they are looking for with as little accountability
as they desire,'' the Texas Republican said in a speech Wednesday
to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
	   Armey has been working with a group of lawmakers in the House
who have been critical of IMF policies and have demanded changes in
how the institution operates.
	   He said that by offering countries ``bailout packages of
enormous size, often at low interest rates, the IMF creates an
incentive for reckless investment and irresponsible government
policies.''
	   Armey said a new dlrs 12.5 billion IMF loan to Russia announced
Monday proved his point.
	   Until now the House has been divided over whether to meet the
Clinton request.
	   ``I will continue to keep putting this on the table,'' Rep.
Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic sponsor of the IMF funds, said Wednesday
after a House subcommittee voted to slash President Bill Clinton's
request to dlrs 3.5 billion.
	   The full House Appropriations Committee is expected to take up
the issue next week when it considers a dlrs 16 billion foreign aid
bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. The IMF money may fare
better there _ but House approval of the funds without conditions
that could prompt a presidential veto remains uncertain.
	   ``There is still a lot of controversy scheduled for this
issue,'' suggested Rep. Sonny Callahan, chairman of the
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations.
	   His panel agreed only to a provision that would earmark dlrs 3.5
billion for a new credit line for the IMF. It turned aside the
administration's remaining request for an additional dlrs 14.5
billion for the international lending institution's main operating
account.
	   The Senate earlier this year approved the full dlrs 18 billion.
	   If Armey's prediction holds up then House and Senate negotiators
are likely to reach an agreement this fall that grants the IMF the
funds it says it needs should the Asian crisis get worse or a new
economic emergency erupt elsewhere.
	   While most Democrats and some influential Republicans support
the full IMF funding, other Republicans oppose it, but for
different reasons.
	   Some are unhappy about the IMF's lending practices, suggesting
it operates in too much secrecy and advances austere policies, but
others are seeking to block support that international institutions
have given to organizations that advocate family planning and
support abortion rights.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad arrived in France
Thursday for the first time in 22 years, a rare Western visit that
could mean a higher profile for Europe in the Middle East peace
process, and for Syria on the world stage.
	   Assad's visit aims to pull Syria out of its diplomatic and
economic isolation. It comes two months after Damascus began

European court says top brands can restrict imports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Customers who like to buy big name
products at cut-rate prices may find those cheap Calvin Kleins and
Nikes a little tougher to get after a ruling Thursday by the
European Court of Justice.
	   The European Union court decided the owner of a trademark could
prohibit products bearing its label from being imported into Europe
without approval.
	   The decision stemmed from an Austrian case where the designer
sunglasses manufacturer Silhouette complained that an Austrian
retailer, Hartlauer, was selling Silhouette sunglasses at a
discount after buying them in Bulgaria.
	   In order to maintain its top-of-the-line image, Silhouette
decided not to deliver frames to Hartlauer on the grounds that
distribution by that company would be harmful because ``low
prices'' was Hautlauer's chief selling point.
	   In 1995, Silhouette sold 21,000 outmoded frames in Bulgaria.
Hartlauer acquired those frames, brought them back to Austria and
launched a big advertising campaign. Silhouette took them to court.
The Court of Justice ruled that a 1988 EU directive allowed a
trademark owner within the EU to prevent its products from being
imported back into the EU.
	   The court decided that Austrian rules providing for the
exhaustion of trademark rights for products put on the market
outside the European Economic Area were contrary to EU legislation
on trademarks.
	   The ruling could spell big trouble for downmarket retailers who
had begun importing big name items from ``gray markets'' outside
the EU after being rejected as ``official'' retail outlets by the
manufacturers. Retailers, such as the British supermarket group
Tesco, say it's a blow to consumers.
	   ``Our customers tell us time and again that they want to buy
these fashionable and popular designer items, but resent having to
pay ridiculous prices for them,'' said Tesco Commercial Director
John Gildersleeve.

Hong Kong's January-June tourism down 21 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ With visits from major Asian countries such as
Japan and South Korea down at least by half, Hong Kong registered a
21 percent drop in tourism in this year's first six months.
	   Overall, the Tourist Association said in a statement Thursday,
it expected arrivals to be down 6 percent this year, totaling fewer
than 10 million.
	   Tourism is a pillar of the Hong Kong economy, accounting for
thousands of jobs. With the economic downturn in Asia cutting into
tourism, hundreds of retail, restaurant and hotel workers have lost
employment.
	   That has contributed to Hong Kong's own economic downturn. The
territory has slid into recession. Unemployment is 4.2 percent, a
15-year high, and growing.
	   The Tourist Association said arrivals from Japan were down 50.1
percent and from South Korea down 60.7 percent in the first half of
the year, compared to January-June last year.
	   Australia, New Zealand and South Asia were among the few markets
that were growing.
	   Officials reported a 70 percent increase in arrivals from
mainland China in June, but said that was mostly due to the small
number of arrivals in 1997. Travel restrictions to Hong Kong were
imposed last year around the time of the July 1 handover to Chinese
rule.
	   Total tourist arrivals in June were almost 750,000, a drop of
5.4 percent from a year earlier.

Eritrea wants closer trade, investment ties with Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with banquet speeches &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki
said Thursday he hoped his visit would lead Malaysian businesses to
be more aggressive in seeking investment opportunities in Africa.
	   Eritrea has been directing public investment toward
rehabilitating and expanding infrastructure while developing a
liberal climate for private sector investment, Afwerki said at a
banquet given by Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar.
	   He said his country will sign a cooperation agreement with
Malaysia to pave the way for closer trade and investment ties.
	   Afwerki arrived Thursday morning for a two-day visit, the first
to Malaysia by an Eritrean president since the country gained
independence from Ethiopia in 1993.
	   The king said Malaysia was willing to share its experience in
economic and social development with other developing countries and
to exchange information and technology.
	   ``We have much to gain by cooperating with one another, for in
doing so we prosper each other,'' said Tuanku Ja'afar.
	   He said Malaysia sympathized with the pains and deprivations
that Eritrea had suffered during the prolonged period of national
liberation.
	   ``However, we are delighted that Eritrea had soon after begun in
earnest to rebuild itself and is determined to lay the foundation
for durable peace and progress,'' he added.
	   Tuanku Ja'afar said Malaysia was impressed by the importance
Eritrea places on self-reliance.
	   ``The railway linking Asmara and Port of Massawa being built
through sheer toil of your labor and ingenuity of your people is
indeed a symbol that all developing countries can emulate,'' he
said.
	   ``Indeed, the Asmara-Massawa railway is the most telling symbol
of your country's freedom, resolve and self-reliance.''

Volvo half-year profit down 23 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Swedish automaker AB Volvo on Thursday
reported a pretax profit of 6.11 billion kronor (dlrs 765 million)
for the first half of 1998, a 23 percent drop from the same period
a year ago.
	   Analysts had been expecting Volvo to earn 5.05 billion kronor.
Profits in this year's and last year's first half were affected by
significant one-time gains.
	   Volvo's sales increased to 101.7 billion kronor (dlrs 12.7
billion), from 89 billion kronor in the first six months of 1997.
Volvo reported North American sales rose 26 percent and were up 13
percent in Europe.
	   ``That more than compensated for the decline in Asia,'' the
company said in a statement.
	   Much of this half-year's profit came from capital gains and
other one-time factors, including 2.13 billion kronor from the sale
of shares. Similar gains from the same period a year ago were 3.27
billion kronor.
	   The company did not address recent speculation that Volvo and
Germany's Volkswagen are considering a merger or an alliance.

Serbian police bursts into ethnic Albanian headquarters

 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout to UPDATE with Serb forces storming Kosovo
ruling party headquarters, impounding documents. TRIMS. No pickup. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb security forces Thrusday
stormed the headquarters of Kosovo's ruling party, moments after
ethnic Albanian separatists convened their clandestine parliament
for the first time.
	   There was no official Serb explanation for the action by about
20 heavily-armed riot police and 10 plainclothes officers, who
entered the drab makeshift building in the heart of Kosovo's
capital.
	   They impounded all documents from the first session of the
clandestine parliament, which is considered illegal by the Serbian
authorities.
	   There was no violence or arrests, and the police withdrew after
about 30 minutes.
	   Ethnic Albanians, who compromise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2
million people, held elections on March 22 for their 120-seat
self-styled parliament and president.
	   Thursday's Serb police action was the first ever at the ruling
Democratic League of Kosovo party headquarters, which also houses
the office of their leader, Ibrahim Rugova. Rugova was inside the
building during the raid.
	   ``The police action wasn't brutal, but it was very swift,'' said
Nekibe Kelmendi, the general secretary of the ruling party, which
holds 90 percent of seats in the new parliament.
	   ``They gave us a two-minute ultimatum to hand them the documents
from the constitutional session, which we did,'' she said.
	   During Thursday's parliament session, Rugova took his
presidential oath, pledging to ``use all his powers for the
formation and preservation of an independent Republic of Kosovo.''
	   Kelmendi said the formation of the Kosovo parliament was ``a
historic act and the result of a new reality in the region which
the international community will have to consider.''
	   Serbia rejects any moves toward Kosovo's independence. Foreign
powers have called for greater Kosovo autonomy, but also oppose
independence of the troubled Serbian province.
	   More than 300 people have been killed since late February, when
Serbian police launched a crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists. There were no fresh reports of fighting Thursday.
	   Attempts by world powers to rally the splintered Albanian
politicians behind Rugova have been unsuccessful, and with
political efforts to gain independence faltering, the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army continues to gain support.
	   The 54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which includes the United States and Canada, plans to go to
Kosovo as part of its Yugoslav fact-finding mission that began
Wednesday in Belgrade.
	   Yugoslavia was suspended from the OSCE in 1992 for fomenting
ethnic conflict in Croatia and Bosnia. It has refused to allow
permanent offices to be set up in the country until its membership
is restored and was likely to demand reactivated membership as the
price for allowing a serious OSCE role in Kosovo.

Arab journalists discuss defending freedoms in Arab world
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Arab journalists met Thursday to discuss
ways of defending public freedoms in the Arab world, where
journalists grapple with government restrictions.
	   Among the topics that will be discussed during the two-day
conference is the reported slapping of a reporter by Lebanon's
president and the imprisonment of an editor in Kuwait for a cartoon
he published, the leftist As-Safir newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The conference, being attended by representatives of
journalists' syndicates, is also expected to adopt a plan to
confront attacks by terrorists against journalists, such as in
Algeria, and to prevent imprisonment of writers in some countries.
	   ``Public freedoms in general, and press freedoms in particular,
are currently facing many challenges in the Arab world,'' said
Ibrahim Nafie, the president of the Cairo-based General Federation
of Arab Journalists, which organized the conference.
	   On the forefront of these challenges are the ``Israeli
occupation's repressive practices and oppressive policies'' against
Palestinians and Lebanese, said Nafie, editor of Egypt's
government-controlled Al-Ahram newspaper.
	   But the conference will also scrutinize actions of leaders at
home.
	   Nafie, speaking at the opening session of the conference, called
on Arab governments to guarantee public freedoms by improving and
upgrading press laws.
	   Most Arab countries have one-man rule or rule by royalty, and
criticism of their regimes is rarely tolerated. Newspapers
sometimes also get into trouble for publishing material that is
deemed to have offended Islam.
	   Last month, a court in Kuwait sentenced Mohammed Jassim
al-Saqar, the editor of the opposition newspaper Al-Qabas, to six
months in jail for publishing a cartoon that showed a teacher
asking his students: ``why did God kick out Adam and Eve from
heaven?''
	   A student answers: ``Because they hadn't paid the rent.'' The
court ruled that the cartoon insulted Islam.
	   The Beirut conference comes amid tension between the Lebanese
press, which is considered the freest in the Arab world, and
President Elias Hrawi.
	   Hrawi, who is known for his offhand public comments, reportedly
slapped Hassan Sabra, publisher of the weekly Ash-Shiraa magazine,
during an argument last month. Hrawi, who was reported to have been
angered by articles Sabra wrote criticizing the administration, has
refused to apologize as demanded by the Lebanese journalists'
syndicates.
	   Nafie called for ``laws pertaining to the preservation of
journalists' dignity, the termination of prison punishment in cases
of publication and the necessity of confronting the phenomenon of
terrorism and assassination of journalists.''

	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ Crowds of students and parents
marched on President Henri Konan Bedie's office to protest a
government move to anull the results of high school entrance exams
in some districts.
	   About a thousand people participated in the march which blocked
traffic in city center of Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's commercial
capital, newspapers reported Thursday.
	   Waving placards and screaming out for Education Minister Pierre
Kipre's resignation, the protest on Wednesday surrounded the
Presidential Palace.
	   Later, a small delegation was allowed to meet with the education
minister. After two hours of talks the two sides had not reached an
agreement, the daily French-language Le Jour reported.
	   On Monday, Kipre announced that the state-administered entrance
exam would be retaken in certain Abidjan centers because the
original tests had been leaked.
	   The protesters and their supporters argue that leaks were more
widespread and that the exam should have been canceled and retaken
by the whole country.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ For the second day, Kenyan teachers walked
off the job Thursday, angered by the government's failure to pay
them raises they were promised last year when they struck just
before general elections.
	   President Daniel arap Moi's government agreed to 200 percent
increases over five years but says now it has no money and has
drawn up legislation that would permit them to renegotiate the
deal.
	   In Nairobi, about 2,000 teachers, majority of them women,
blocked the main street to parliament building after they were
stopped by anti riot police from marching to the parliament.
	   ``Parliament is for Kenyans, that is why we are going there,''
urged an official of the Kenya National Union of Teachers, Francis
Ng'ang'a, ``We voted for the MPs (legislators) and we want to tell
them to withdraw the bill.
	   The teachers stayed put on the street as the danced, sang and
waving anti government placards.
	   There are some 260,000 teachers for seven million students in
primary and secondary schools in Kenya. After a month-long strike
late last year, the teachers managed to obtain increases varying
from 100 to 200 percent over five years.
	   Education Minister Kalonzo Musyoka said if the raises agreed on
last year were put into effect, 80 percent of his ministry's
1998-99 budget of 44 billion shillings (dlrs 733 million) would go
to pay salaries.
	   -----
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) - The United States has agreed to give
Mozambique 25,000 tons of wheat, valued at dlrs 5 million, to help
Mozambique's balance of payments.
	   The Mozambican News Agency said the United States Information
Service said money raised locally from the sales of the wheat will
be used in development programs.
	   The agency said Wednesday that the new aid raises the total U.S.
food aid to Mozambique to dlrs 33 million in 1998.
	   Last year the United States provided 88,000 tons of food valued
at dlrs 25 million. The agency said American aid next year is
expected to total 100,000 tons, also valued at dlrs 25 million.
	   -----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Finance Minister Trevor Manuel
asked Parliament on Thursday to hold a special debate on the
volatility of South Africa's currency and the effect on the
economy.
	   The Finance Ministry said the debate is scheduled for Wednesday.
	   The rand has come under severe pressure in recent weeks, losing
more than 20 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar. The
rand, which was trading at 4.86 to the dollar at the end of last
year, was trading at 6.19 to the dollar Thursday afternoon. In
recent weeks it has traded as high as 6.75 to the dollar.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) - Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi
unveiled the foundation stone at the site of the MOZAL aluminum
foundry on Wednesday at Beluluane outside Maputo.
	   South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who was visiting
Mozambique, called the project ``a declaration of the desire to see
Mozambique succeed.''
	   The foundry is the largest single private investment in the
history of Mozambique. It represents a total investment of about
dlrs 1.3 billion.

	   ACCRA, Ghana (AP) _ A group of Ghanaian followers of African
traditional religions have appealed to the government to regulate
religious broadcasts to ensure peace between different faiths.
	   In a statement signed Tuesday, the group African Renaissance
Mission accused some Christian broadcasters of ridiculing them in
radio and television programs.
	   The statement accused Christians, particularly Pentecostal
Christians, of openly insulting and lying about them in sermons and
in songs.
	   ``We cannot see why the gospel preachers cannot propagate their
gospel in a more peaceful manner,'' the statement said.
	   Clashes between Christians and traditional worshipers have
increased in recent times.
	   Last month, a group of traditionalist youths reportedly broke
into a Sunday church service in Accra, injuring people and damaging
property because the worshipers had allegedly breached a ban
against drumming imposed by a traditional priest of the area as
part of a festival.

Ukrainian nuclear plants reporting more malfunctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - The number of malfunctions at Ukraine's
nuclear power plants has started to grow because of outdated
equipment and disregard for safety rules, the top nuclear safety
official said Thursday.
	   In the first half of 1998, there were 37 malfunctions and
disruptions of work at the country's five atomic power plants, or
1.5 times more than during the same period last year, said
Olexander Smyshlyayev, head of the nuclear regulation
administration at the Environment Safety Ministry.
	   The largest number of malfunctions, 14, was registered at the
southeastern Zaporizhya plant, Europe's largest, followed by 12 at
the Rivne power plant.
	   Five disruptions were registered at the Chernobyl nuclear plant,
the site of the world's worst nuclear incident in 1986. Although
the number might seem low, Chernobyl currently has only one working
reactor, compared to Zaporizhya and Rivne with three working
reactors each.
	   Smyshlyayev blamed the plants' outdated equipment. He said it
should be updated or replaced. He also said plant managers
``systematically failed'' to strictly observe safety norms, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Smyshlyayev said he had demanded urgent steps to improve the
situation last week, after which Cabinet leaders promised to
allocate another 30 million hryvna (dlrs 15 million) for plant
repairs.
	   However, nuclear industry managers frequently complain that they
fail to even get those funds already earmarked for them in the
budget.

Warsaw offers four new locations for Jackson amusement park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Warsaw authorities are offering four new
locations to Michael Jackson for consideration as sites for his
planned amusement park, a Jackson lawyer said Thursday.
	   `` We believe that all the options are very interesting and we
are going to look into them in a very, very serious fashion,'' said
Amnon Shiboleth, who visited the sites and discussed the project
with city authorities during a visit this week.
	   Last year, the King of Pop signed a letter of intent with Warsaw
Mayor Marcin Swiecicki to develop a dlrs 500 million theme park in
Warsaw. However, the Interior Ministry refused to let go of his
favored site, a military airport where Jackson performed two years
ago.
	   In a brief statement, Shiboleth said he will present maps and
other materials about the proposed sites to Jackson. ``I visited
the four places. We like them all,'' he said.
	   The mayor refused to identify the sites, saying city authorities
had to check their ownership first.
	   ``We don't want to create tensions,'' he said.
	   Swiecicki said he hoped all problems could be solved before May
1999, when the current letter of intent expires.

`Titanic' heartthrob DiCaprio deems kissing 'disgusting'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio says that despite his
many romances, he finds kissing none too appetizing.
	   ``When you think about it, kissing is pretty disgusting,'' the
23-year-old ``Titanic'' star told Britain's Eva magazine. ``The
human mouth is one of the dirtiest things on this planet. There's
so much bacteria, slime and trapped food _ a dog's mouth is much
cleaner.''
	   DiCaprio told the magazine that many women offer him sexual
favors, but said he prefers pursuing the type who ``won't even give
you a second glance.''
	   While critics have described DiCaprio as a womanizer, he
protested to the magazine that he does not romance women ``just for
the hell of it.''
	   DiCaprio said he has yet to find ``absolute love'' and will not
settle down until he does.
	   He also told Eva he once was a heavy drinker and drug user.
	   ``I used to smoke a lot of grass, but I quit that over a year
ago because it made me pretty paranoid and really sad,'' he said.

 &UR; Five English hooligans sentenced to jail terms

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Four English soccer hooligans received
jail terms Thursday from 40 days to two months for rioting in
Marseille during the World Cup.
	   English fans battled local youths for three days June 13-15.
Along with violence by German thugs in the northern city of Lens,
which left a French policeman in a coma, they were among the worst
disturbances of the tournament.
	   Judicial officials, speaking on customary anonymity, identified
the four as: Steven Powell, 25; Alan Libbiard, 28; Shane Radford,
22; and Martin Kerr, 39.
	   Kerr was sentenced for attacking a policeman, and received two
months as well as a two-year ban on returning to France.
	   The others were sentenced for ``blows and voluntary injuries''
and received 40 days, plus a one-year ban on returning. With time
in jail already counted, plus other adjustments, they could be free
by the end of the week.
	   The trial of a Tunisian youth, involved in the same rioting, was
postponed to next week.

Seasonal flooding kills 760 people in China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A longer than usual summer flood season has
killed 760 people and caused more than 47 billion yuan (dlrs 5.6
billion) in economic losses in China, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported Thursday.
	   The Ministry of Civil Affairs, which handles disaster relief
operations, said heavy rains had caused flooding across 13
provinces and regions since May, Xinhua reported.
	   Flooding destroyed more than 1.4 million houses and 4.7 million
hectares (11.6 million acres) of farmland, Xinhua said. The
ministry has sent 100 million yuan (dlrs 12 million) in relief
funds and several thousand tents to the affected areas.
	   Because the flood season began earlier than usual, some areas
have been inundated more than once, Xinhua said. Although the
report did not given an explanation for the lengthy flood season,
government meteorologists have previously blamed the El Nino
weather phenomenon.

Novartis announces half-yearly sales rise of 1 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis
said Thursday its first-half 1998 sales rose by one percent on the
same period the previous year.
	   Sales for the first six months rose to 16.77 billion Swiss
francs (dlrs 11.5 billion) from 16.52 billion francs (dlrs 11.3
billion) last year, the company said in a statement.
	   In March, Novartis announced a 43 percent rise in its net profit
for 1997, the first full year since it was created by the merger of
Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG.
	   The group said its first-half pharmaceutical sales were 3
percent higher than in 1997, although it didn't specify the amount.
	   Over the full year, Novartis expects ``a marked increase in net
income to new record levels.'' It called 1998 ``a transition year
marked by a shift from integration to a focus on growth and product
launches.''
	   Novartis will present its first-half 1998 earnings report at the
end of August, the company announced.

Pakistan issues arrest warrant for Benazir Bhutto
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ The Lahore High Court on Thursday issued
an arrest warrant for former prime minister Benazir Bhutto after
she failed to appear in court on a charge of corruption.
	   Ms. Bhutto, who is in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), was to
appear in court Thursday. Her appearance has been rescheduled for
July 27. Ms. Bhutto is accused of failing to declare some of her
assets when she filed election papers prior to the February 1997
elections.
	   Although Ms. Bhutto could be arrested when she returns to
Pakistan, it seems unlikely given that she has not been arrested on
previous warrants.
	   Ms. Bhutto is in the UAE visiting her three children. Citing
security reasons Ms. Bhutto relocated her children to the UAE
nearly one year ago.
	   Ms. Bhutto was dismissed from power in November 1996, and been
accused of widespread corruption and economic mismanagement. She
has denied the charges.
	   Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, has been in jail since his wife's
dismissal on a variety of charges, including the murder of Ms.
Bhutto's estranged brother, Murtaza.

UN chief says council should consider Macedonia troop increase
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that violence in Kosovo could
cross the border, U.N. chief Kofi Annan recommended Thursday that
the Security Council consider increasing the U.N. peacekeeping
force for Macedonia by another 350 troops.
	   The majority of the troops, 230, would be deployed at nine new
observation posts along the Kosovo and Albanian borders, Annan said
in a report to the council.
	   In addition, a reserve group of about 60 soldiers in two
platoons would patrol the ground and air. The council should also
consider increasing the number of military observers and civilian
police by 12 and 24 respectively, Annan wrote.
	   The recommendation comes as diplomatic efforts have intensified
to try to stop the violence between ethnic Albanian separatists in
Kosovo and troops from Serb-led Yugoslavia. Hundreds have been
killed since a Serb crackdown in Kosovo began in February.
	   ``Recent developments in Kosovo have highlighted the danger of
renewed violence in the area and the serious repercussions such
violence could have upon the external and internal security of the
Republic,'' of Macedonia, Annan wrote.
	   He repeated his recommendation that the mandate of the current
750 U.N. troops _ including nearly 340 Americans _ be extended for
another six months, until Feb. 28. Those troops were sent to
Macedonia in 1992 to prevent the spread of the ethnic conflict in
other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
	   In a July 9 letter, Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj
Handzinski endorsed Annan's recommendation for an extended mandate
as well as the option of a greater troop presence.
	   Annan said he would give the council a cost estimate once they
agreed to the increases. He noted that any increase in the size of
the U.N. force could be accompanied by an even greater
international military buildup, he said.
	   ``Discussions are still continuing at the international level on
the possible need for an expanded international military presence
in the region and on the establishment of a comprehensive
monitoring regime as a consequence of the situation in Kosovo,'' he
wrote.
	   The U.N. operation, formally known as the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force, includes troops from six nations. They
are Denmark, Finland, Indonesia, Norway and Sweden in addition to
the United States.

Polish government, opposition compromise on province consolidation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Kwasniewski statement &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish politicians reached a compromise
Thursday on how to consolidate the country's many provinces, a
reform needed to eliminate communist-era administration and
transfer more power to local government.
	   After weeks of wrangling, Solidarity-led government and
opposition leaders agreed on a motion to replace the current 49
provinces with 16, parliament speaker Maciej Plazynski said.
Parliament is to review the motion Friday.
	   President Aleksander Kwasniewski welcomed the deal ironed out
during overnight negotiations. ``I'm going to respect this
compromise,'' Kwasniewski said in a statement.
	   While most politicians support the decentralization plan, the
number of provinces proved a sticking point.
	   An initial government plan for 12 new provinces drew protests
from residents of cities that would lose their status as provincial
capitals. A revised plan for 15 provinces was vetoed on July 2 by
Kwasniewski, who said it contradicted the wishes of local
communities.
	   Kwasniewski and other leaders of the leftist opposition had
argued that Poland should avoid the controversy by returning to the
17 provinces it had before 1975, when the communists fractured the
country into small provinces that were fully dependent on the
central government in Warsaw.
	   The decentralization reform is to take effect Jan. 1.

Sweden favored against Germany _ but watch out for Becker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) _ Defending champion Sweden would appear
to be clear favorites against a young German team in their Davis
Cup matchup starting Friday.
	   The Swedes are led by Jonas Bjoerkman, the world's ninth-ranked
player, and Thomas Enqvist, who has cracked the Top 10 and is now
ranked 18th.
	   The Germans will rely on inexperienced Nicolas Kiefer and Tommy
Haas. On paper, the matchups should allow Sweden to roll into the
competition's third round.
	   But the Germans, three-time champions, have an ace-in-the-hole
in the battle of two traditional Davis Cup powers. As usual, it's
Boris Becker.
	   Becker, now the head of the Davis Cup team, could insert himself
into Sunday's reverse singles if his two young proteges stumble.
	   The former World No. 1, easing into retirement, surprised
himself and others by reaching last week's Swiss Open final in one
of his few tournaments this year.
	   ``The question is still open of whether I play singles or not,''
said Becker, although he will let his two young proteges contest
Friday's opening singles matches in the best-of-five competition.
	   Thursday's draw favored Sweden, with Bjoerkman likely to give
the defending champions a fast start when he faces Haas in the
first singles. The German is ranked 39th.
	   ``The draw was perfect,'' said Swedish captain Carl-Axel
Hageskog.
	   Afterwards, German No. 1 Kiefer tangles with Enqvist. In
Saturday's doubles, Becker and David Prinosil will team up against
Nicklas Kulti and Enqvist.
	   The match will be played on a hardcourt surface laid over the
clay at Rothenbaum stadium _ with the faster surface favored by
both the Germans and Swedish players.
	   Hardcourts are also the favorite of Becker, an old nemesis of
six-time champion Sweden. He led Germany to Davis Cup titles in
1988 and 1989, beating the Scandanavians in both finals.

Ukrainian nuclear plants reporting more malfunctions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The number of malfunctions at Ukraine's
nuclear power plants has started to grow because of outdated
equipment and disregard for safety rules, the top nuclear safety
official said Thursday.
	   In the first half of 1998, there were 37 malfunctions and
disruptions of work at the country's five atomic power plants, or
1.5 times more than during the same period last year, said
Olexander Smyshlyayev, head of the nuclear regulation
administration at the Environment Safety Ministry.
	   The largest number of malfunctions, 14, was registered at the
southeastern Zaporizhya plant, Europe's largest, followed by 12 at
the Rivne power plant.
	   Five disruptions were registered at the Chernobyl nuclear plant,
the site of the world's worst nuclear incident in 1986. Although
the number might seem low, Chernobyl currently has only one working
reactor, compared to Zaporizhya and Rivne with three working
reactors each.
	   Smyshlyayev blamed the plants' outdated equipment. He said it
should be updated or replaced. He also said plant managers
``systematically failed'' to strictly observe safety norms, the
Interfax news agency reported.
	   Smyshlyayev said he had demanded urgent steps to improve the
situation last week, after which Cabinet leaders promised to
allocate another 30 million hryvna (dlrs 15 million) for plant
repairs.
	   However, nuclear industry managers frequently complain that they
fail to even get those funds already earmarked for them in the
budget.

Doctor attributes Ronaldo's poor health to fatigue and stress
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The fit of convulsions suffered by Ronaldo hours
before the World Cup final was probably caused by ``severe fatigue,
weariness and stress,'' says the radiologist who examined the
Brazilian star just before the match.
	   But the medical team that treated Ronaldo didn't have enough
information about the star's health to rule out the possibility
that the player had an epileptic fit, Dr. Bernard Roger told the
French daily Le Monde in an interview published Thursday.
	   Without precise information, the doctor said he couldn't ``a
priori'' exclude the use of stimulants or painkillers either, Le
Monde reported without giving a direct quote.
	   Roger, who examined the 21-year-old star about four hours before
the championship match between Brazil and France Sunday, said that
the precise clinical state of Ronaldo and the drugs given to him
remain unknown.
	   ``The most probable is that it was a conjunction of three
elements: severe fatigue, weariness and stress,'' he said.
	   Ronaldo fainted and suffered pains at 2:30 p.m., six and a half
hours before kickoff, Le Monde said.
	   As soon as the star regained consciousness, he was driven to the
Clinique des Lilas, north of Paris, which he left at 7:50 pm, only
70 minutes before the game began, according to Le Monde.
	   Ronaldo was left off the initial Brazil lineup. But after tests
ruled out any serious medical condition, the two-time FIFA World
Player of the Year was rushed to the Stade de France, where he
arrived just 45 minutes before kickoff.
	   He was then reinstated about 40 minutes before the game, when a
second team sheet was released.
	   But according to Le Monde, the French doctors were not asked
whether the player was fit to play.
	   Brazil team doctor Lidio Toledo said Monday that Ronaldo had
suffered a stress-related fit.
	   The striker, who appeared very tired Tuesday upon his return to
Brazil, is now resting in Angra dos Reis, south of Rio de Janeiro.

Mexico arrests two Italians on drug charges; claims Mafia ties

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Police in the Caribbean resort of Cancun
arrested and expelled two alleged members of the Italian mafia,
part of four-nation operation to break up an international drug
ring.
	   Fourteen people were arrested Canada, the United States, Italy
and Mexico, Canadian authorities said Wednesday.
	   The Mexican Attorney General's Office said investigators had
been trailing Oreste Pagano and Alberto Minelli for six months. A
statement from the office said Pagano was an important figure in
the Italian mafia.
	   Mexican police said Pagano and Minelli had helped transport
cocaine from Colombia to Italy and were involved in money
laundering in Canada, the daily Reforma reported Thursday.
	   Immigration officials expelled the two men to Italy, via Canada,
saying both were in Mexico illegally because Pagano was carrying a
forged Venezuelan passport and Minelli couldn't prove he had been
admitted legally.
	   The men told investigators that for the last year and a half,
they had been involved in a real estate business in Cancun, Reforma
said.

Russia's parliament turns down key parts of austerity package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with finance minister saying parliament has failed to
support key elements of government austerity program. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) - With an international bailout package in the
balance, parliament on Thursday rejected key elements of President
Boris Yeltsin's economic austerity plan.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders want the
austerity program in place before releasing funds from a
multi-billion-dollar loan package that was agreed on Monday.
	   Parliament lower house, the State Duma, approved a bill setting
forth the general principles for tax collection. But it rejected
two important measures that were designed to raise revenue for the
cash-strapped government - a land tax and a sales tax.
	   Mikhail Zadornov, the finance minister, told lawmakers they had
failed to support a program that could lead the country out of its
economic crisis.
	   ``The key points which should lead the country out of crisis
have not been supported by you,'' Zadornov said.
	   The Communists and nationalists in parliament generally oppose
spending cuts and tax hikes, arguing that such measures will hurt
ordinary Russians.
	   Yeltsin's administration has sent more than 20 proposals to
parliament, saying they are needed to ensure the loan package and
end the country's latest financial crisis.
	   The lawmakers passed a number of measures Tuesday and Wednesday,
but have balked at laws that would increase taxes.
	   Thursday was the second and final day of a special Duma session
devoted to the government's austerity plan, and lawmakers were
expected to meet well into the evening.
	   With parliament opposing important parts of the austerity plan,
the International Monetary Fund could find itself in an awkward
position when its board meets Monday in Washington to review the
Russian loan deal.
	   The IMF and others do not want to release the loans until they
are convinced Russia is serious about financial reform, but the
Russian markets are likely to crash if assistance doesn't arrive
soon.
	   The international loan agreement would bring dlrs 17.1 billion
in new funds this year and next to help stabilize financial
markets.
	   The Communists are wary of the loan package, saying it could
saddle Russia with debt it cannot afford to repay. But Russia
already must pay off billions of dollars in short-term debt that
will be due in coming months, and it probably can't meet the
payments without the new loans, analysts say.
	   Yeltsin has indicated he will implement some austerity measures
by decree if the parliament does not enact them.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.

Search launched for small plane missing off Newfoundland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) _ Canadian and U.S. rescue services
launched an extensive search Thursday for a small plane carrying
two Swedes which disappeared off Newfoundland while trying to
complete a transatlantic flight.
	   Three planes and nine ships were scouring the North Atlantic for
any sign of the two Swedes _ a man and a woman _ who were on their
way from the Azores to St. John's, Newfoundland.
	   The names of the missing were not released.
	   Radio contact with the Swiss-owned plane was lost late Tuesday
night. There was no distress call.
	   Two aircraft from a Canadian air base in Nova Scotia and an U.S.
Coast Guard patrol plane were searching the area about 500
kilometers (300 miles) southeast of Newfoundland with radar, said
Peter Stow of the Halifax search and rescue center.
	   He said the search was hampered by thick fog.
	   The missing plane _ a low-wing, single-engine model _ was
carrying about 8 1/2 hours worth of fuel for a flight that should
have taken six hours. It was headed for an air show in the United
States. The trip to Newfoundland was the first leg of the flight.

BlueWave beat Fighters 7-5
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Takeshi Hidaka hit his first home run of the season
in the top of the 11th inning and Harvey Jerome Pulliam singled in
another run, giving the Orix BlueWave a 7-5 victory over the
Pacific League's front-running Nippon Ham Fighters at Tokyo Dome
Thursday.
	   The Fighters led 5-1 on a three-run home run by Nigel Wilson in
the fifth inning, but the BlueWave tied the game 5-5 on Ichiro
Suzuki's one-run single and a three-run double by former Colorado
Rockies player Pulliam in the eighth.
	   The Fighters' Jerry Brooks, formerly with the Florida Marlins,
hit his 20th homer of the season in the first inning, giving him
the league lead.
	   Wilson, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, has 16 homers.
	   The Fighters are seven games ahead of the Seibu Lions and the
Kintetsu Buffaloes, whose scheduled game at Seibu Dome was rained
out.
	   At Fukuoka Dome, Julio Franco hit a two-run home run in the top
of the ninth and the Chiba Lotte Marines edged the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks 3-2.
	   Brian Warren, formerly with the Texas Rangers, held the Hawks to
one hit over the last 1 1/3 innings for his first victory against
no defeats.
	   The Marines led 1-0 in the fourth on a home run by Kiyoshi
Hatsushiba, but the Hawks made it 2-1 on Koji Akiyama's home run
and Shikato Yanagida's one-run single in the seventh.
	   Franco, formerly of the Milwaukee Brewers, hit his 14th homer of
the season after a single by Makoto Kosa.
	   Hatsushiba has 16 homers and Akiyama 7.
	   In the Central League, Leo Gomez smashed a two-run home run in
the three-run third inning as the Chunichi Dragons beat the
Hiroshima Toyo Carp 6-1 at Hiroshima.
	   Gomez, formerly with the Chicago Cubs, has 12 homers.
	   The Dragons, who ended their losing streak at four, are now 4
1/2 games behind the front-running Yokohama BayStars, whose
scheduled game with the Yomiuri Giants at Yokohama was rained out.
	   A scheduled game between the Yakult Swallows and the Hanshin
Tigers at Tokyo's Jingu Stadium was also rained out.

Woods in hunt as British Open begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Woods' quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods took advantage of his
length and hot putter today to shoot a 5-under 65 and tie John
Huston for the early lead in the British Open.
	   Woods, looking to contend in a major for the first time since
winning the Masters, nearly drove the 411-yard (375-meter) ninth
hole and reached the only two par-5s on the course with irons on
his second shot. But the putter, which has betrayed him in recent
major championships, may have been the key on a warm and nearly
windless day at Royal Birkdale.
	   Woods would have had the early lead to himself, but his 5-foot
(1 1/2-meter) par putt on the final hole hit the left lip and
kicked out. It was a rare mistake on a day he made seven birdies
against two bogeys.
	   The score was a stroke off the 64 Woods shot last year at Royal
Troon. But that came in the third round after he had basically shot
himself out of contention and he finished in a tie for 24th.
	   ``This was very similar to the third round at Troon, but this
time I putted better,'' Woods said. ``I made a couple of bombs
which felt really good.''
	   Woods, who made four birdie putts within 12 feet (3 1/2 meters)
on the front side, sank a curling 35-footer (10 1/2-meter) on the
13th hole to offset a bogey a hole earlier. He then birdied the
par-5 15th and 17th holes before closing with the bogey 5.
	   With more than half the field still out on a course that played
much simpler than expected because of the fair weather, Woods and
Huston were a shot better than 1994 Open winner Nick Price in the
opening round.
	   Another shot back at 67 were Brad Faxon and Sweden's Fredrik
Jacobson.
	   The weather was in stark contrast to conditions in practice this
week when the wind howled and players grumbled that no one would
break par for the championship. And it was enjoyed with a close eye
kept on the forecast for increased winds and rain on Friday.
	   ``As the sun broke through, it was almost perfect,'' Woods said.
``We might even get some people with heat stroke out here.''
	   Woods played nearly perfect golf on the front side, taking
advantage of light winds and soft greens that tamed the links on
the Irish Sea. He moved into the lead with a 3-foot (1-meter)
birdie after chipping to the ninth green, and had three more
birdies on the back nine.
	   At the par-3 12th, Woods misclubbed and hit the ball over the
green. He chipped to within 2-feet (1 1/2 meter), but lipped out
his par putt.
	   Woods, whose putter kept him from contending in the U.S. Open
and the Masters this year, hasn't won a major since the 1997
Masters and has won only once on the PGA Tour this year, in the
BellSouth Classic.
	   But he insisted coming into the Open that he was striking the
ball well, and he showed it with some long drives and precise irons
before a massive gallery that cheered every shot.
	   Jacobson, playing in the first group of the day, used an eagle
on the par-5 17th to take the early clubhouse lead.
	   It didn't last long, though, as Huston made a 40-footer
(12-meter) for eagle on the 17th hole, then hit a spectacular shot
out of the deep rough on the final hole that hopped up on the green
and rolled to within 3 feet (1 meter) of the hole for a finishing
birdie and a 5-under 65.
	   Huston, who had to use a special career money winning exemption
to play on the PGA tour this year, credited magnets in his bed and
in the insole of his shoes for helping relieve tendinitis and
bursitis and allow him to play nearly pain-free again.
	   ``Last year, pretty much every day I would get up and wouldn't
feel very strong, kind of achey,'' Huston said. ``I didn't look
forward to going to the golf course, and it showed.''
	   While Huston was having his best day in five Opens, it was Woods
who thrilled the crowd on a day when overcast skies and little wind
helped the field throw high iron shots at the pins without fear of
the tall meadow rye rough.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, meanwhile, teased his fans with
two early birdies but may have shot himself out of yet another Open
in the first round with a 40 on the back for a 3-over 73.
	   England's Lee Westwood, who along with David Duval had been one
of the young favorites, also got off to a shaky start with two
bogeys on the front nine. Westwood had to birdie the 16th and 17th
to finish at 1-over 71, while Duval bogeyed the first hole and was
1-over at the turn.
	   Neither Duval nor Westwood has won a major, but both have been
dominant players in the last year. Westwood in particular is on a
roll, having won seven times on four continents in the last nine
months, including three of his last four tournaments.
	   And both show no fear if it comes to a Sunday showdown.
	   ``I'm not afraid to win, so if I do get the opportunity I hope
to take it,'' said the 25-year-old Westwood, who has surpassed Nick
Faldo and Montgomerie as England's best hope.
	   Woods, of course, already has his win in a major. And he also
has the length to contend at the 7,018-yard (6,414-meter) Birkdale,
where the winds can play havoc with scores. He not only hits it
long, but has the power to rip the ball out of the deep meadow rye
that has encroached even further on the fairways than the last time
the Open was here in 1991.
	   ``I think I have a chance in each and every major,'' Woods said
earlier. ``You've got to be hitting on all cylinders in order to
win. Every facet of your game has to be good in order to win a
major.''
	   Tom Lehman, who won in 1996, had a late tee time but still
played despite injuring his right shoulder at a local amusement
park on Tuesday.
	   ``I'll definitely be OK,'' Lehman said. ``I was just messing
around with the kids.''
	   No matter who contends this week, though, the eighth Open held
in this town on the Irish Sea will mark the passing of an era.
	   Jack Nicklaus made sure of that when he announced earlier this
month that he would skip Birkdale, ending his remarkable streak of
major tournaments at 146.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police investigating the deaths
of three young brothers in a firebomb attack announced a ``small
number'' of further arrests Thursday.
	   Police already were questioning one man arrested after the
Sunday morning arson attack that killed the three sons of a
Catholic woman in Ballymoney, 40 miles (65 kms) northwest of
Belfast. Another was released without charge Wednesday.
	   Detectives provided no further details about Thursday's arrests.
	   The killing of Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, aged 11, 10 and 9,
after a week of violent demonstrations, undermined a campaign by
the Protestant Orange Order to make a prohibited march through a
Catholic area of Portadown, 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Belfast.
	   Hard-line members of the Protestant fraternal order, determined
to stay at Drumcree Anglican church until they are permitted to
march, stood by Thursday while police searched again for explosives
and firearms.
	   A search on Wednesday recovered explosives and a submachine gun
from fields near the church, underlining the order's inability to
control its violent allies. Police arrested more than 20 people,
and four were charged Wednesday with offenses including riotous
behavior and possessing a bomb.
	   About 200 supporters of the Protestant order melted away
overnight from a country road leading to the church. Police said
only eight representatives of the Portadown Orange lodges would be
allowed in while the search continued, and that numbers would have
to be strictly controlled afterward.
	   ``While the police will accommodate legitimate and peaceful
protest, it will not tolerate the continued use of unarmed
protesters as cover for murderous acts on the security forces,''
Assistant Chief Constable Tom Craig said Wednesday.
	   The Orange Order had been protesting since July 5, when police
and soldiers enforced a government order barring the march.
	   Two years ago, the Orangemen faced down police and the army to
march through the Catholic Garvaghy Road. But this year, Northern
Ireland's largest Protestant fraternal organization has faced
reversals on several fronts.
	   The security forces stopped them at the church, and the police
lines held while hard-line Protestants threw bombs at the
barricades, blocked roads around Northern Ireland and attacked the
homes of Catholics and police with firebombs.
	   The Orange Order stages hundreds of parades every summer, mostly
on the 12th of July anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne, where
the Protestant King William of Orange defeated the Catholic King
James II in 1690.
	   An organization that prides itself on its Christianity and
discipline fell into public feuding between hard-liners and those
who agreed with an Orange chaplain who said no road was worth three
lives.
	   While the Orangemen said they wanted a peaceful and dignified
protest, bombs were thrown and shots were fired at police in the
darkness.
	   On Wednesday, the Church of Ireland demanded that the Orange
Order ``end their occupation of church property at Drumcree.'' The
church closed the parish hall where protesters had been meeting and
cooking, and also padlocked two fields where Orangemen had been
parking.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The bones of Russia's last czar
arrived in the old imperial capital Thursday and were driven in a
solemn procession to their burial place, 80 years after the monarch
was forced into Siberian exile and executed.
	   The burial of Nicholas II and his family, set for Friday, was
intended as a healing gesture and an act of repentance for the
abuses of the communist era. But it's been mired in controversy as
politicians and religious leaders argued over how to handle the
service.
	   In a surprise development Thursday, President Boris Yeltsin
changed his mind and announced he would attend Friday's service.
The president had been planning to skip the ceremony because it had
become so contentious.
	   ``The truth (about the executions) was concealed for 80 years,''
Yeltsin said. ``Nothing was said about it. And tomorrow, the truth
should be told, and I should take part.''
	   Nicholas abdicated in 1917 amid rising political tensions, and
spent the next several months at a palace just outside St.
Petersburg. But the Bolsheviks then sent him to Siberia and
executed him and his family on July 17, 1918 _ 80 years ago Friday.
	   Their bodies were dumped in a mass grave in the forest outside
the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg and remained there until
they were unearthed in 1991.
	   Before being flown to St. Petersburg on Thursday, the bones,
sealed inside nine small coffins, were taken from a morgue to a
hilltop church in Yekaterinburg for a three-hour public service.
	   Hundreds of Russians knelt to pray, and some wept, as they
viewed coffins at the Ascension of the Lord Church.
	   ``I have come to pay a last tribute to the innocent victims,''
said a tearful Vera Kolchina, 74. ``Their deaths were a tragic part
of our history.''
	   About 1,000 people visited the church, which was just up the
hill from the house where Nicholas and his family were executed.
The infamous house was torn down two decades ago under the
supervision of the local Communist Party boss at the time _
Yeltsin.
	   Immediately following the church service, an honor guard carried
the coffins out of the church and they were flown to St. Petersburg
on an Aeroflot cargo jet.
	   There, the coffins were loaded into black funeral vans and
driven in a long procession through the streets of the old capital,
slowing poignantly as they passed the Winter Palace, the czar's
official residence.
	   Spectators lined up four deep on the sidewalk, and mostly
watched in silence as the cortege passed. At the end of the route,
military pallbearers took the coffins from the vans and carried
them, slowly and stiffly, into the St. Peter and Paul Cathedral,
resting place of czars since Peter the Great.
	   Russians have decidedly mixed feelings about the last czar. Some
view him as a despot, others consider him a martyr, and there are
those who believe he was simply a weak, indecisive ruler
overwhelmed by the tides of history. Some found themselves
inexplicably moved by the funeral procession.
	   ``I cried,'' said Lyuba Novikova, who stood at the entrance of
the Peter and Paul Fortress, near the cathedral where the remains
will be buried. She had brought her daughter to watch.
	   ``I'm a simple person,'' she added. ``I can't say why, but I
cried. It was like a shadow over us, and now we hope things will be
better for Russia.''
	   The coffins, each decorated with an ornately etched name plate,
hold the remains of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, three of their
five children and four servants.
	   The coffins of the czar and czarina are draped with the yellow
flag of the Romanov family.
	   The other two children, the only son Alexei and a daughter the
scientists believe is Maria, were executed along with the entire
family. But their remains have not been found and most
investigators believe the bodies were burned to ashes.
	   There's long been a myth that one daughter, Anastasia, survived
the shooting and escaped. But scientific tests indicate her bones
are among the remains and those of her sister Maria are missing.
	   Extensive DNA testing in the United States, Britain and Russia
convinced scientists of the authenticity of the remains. But the
Russian Orthodox Church has refused to accept the results, and top
church officials were not at the services, though local priests
were officiating.

Asia's developing nations preach caution on foreign investment

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Opinion leaders from 16 Asian developing
nations preached caution on foreign investment but reached no
consensus Thursday on whether to offer unrestricted access to
foreign corporations.
	   The developing nations also want mandatory transfers of
technology from multinational corporations when investments are
made in local markets, the statement said.
	   ``Participants ... have been of the view that host developing
countries should exercise discretion to selectively permit foreign
direct investment in priority areas in line with their national
development objectives,'' the Indian government said in a statement
after the two-day talks on international investment arrangements.
	   India hosted the meeting of government officials, industry
leaders and nongovernmental organizations with the U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development to discuss international investment.
	   U.N. officials said the conference was to familiarize developing
nations with existing investment arrangements. The discussions were
closed to the press.
	   Experts explained the range of options available to governments
trying _ from regulating which companies to let into the market to
keeping certain areas of the economy off-limits.
	   ``The views expressed ranged from the opinion that there was no
need for an international investment regime that was legally
binding, to the view that bilateral investment promotion agreements
were sufficient to enhance FDI flows,'' the statement said.
	   The participating countries were Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, North
Korea, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia,
Nepal, Pakistan, The Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand
and Vietnam.
	   In April this year, trade and finance ministers from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which
comprises the world's richest nations, postponed for six months
negotiations talks on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment,
which would set international rules for billions of investment
dollars.

Netanyahu lashes out at critics: `It hurts'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained
Thursday that he has been subjected to a relentless campaign of
personal attacks by opponents who have not spared his wife, his
children or his friends.
	   ``There is a personal price,'' Netanyahu said in an unexpected
outpouring at what was supposed to be a brief appearance before
photographers. ``It's not true that I have the skin of an elephant.
There is a personal price _ and it hurts.''
	   The latest attack on the prime minister came this week when an
opposition legislator called for an investigation of allegations
that Netanyahu had tried to influence the judge in a high-profile
treason case. The legislator, Nissim Zvili, has since withdrawn the
demand, saying he accepted the judge's denial. Netanyahu also
denied having had contact with the judge.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday blamed ``elements in the opposition,'' who
he said ``took advantage of this ugly opportunity to discredit me
... even at the expense of the good name of a judge and at the cost
of undermining confidence in the Israeli judicial system.
	   ``If I ever thought there was a limit to how low my opponents
were willing to go, it turns out I was wrong,'' he said.
	   ``This is not a thing of a day or two,'' he added, speaking
slowly and emotionally. ``In the past few years, I have been the
target of insults, ridicule, lies, jabs, and baseless claims. I, my
wife and my children, my colleagues serve as targets of stories
that never existed.
	   ``These things have one name: character assassination.''
	   Netanyahu's bitter attack seemed disproportionate to the
accusations made against him this week, although it was not the
first time he has claimed to be the victim of a conspiracy by
opponents who have never accepted his election.
	   Netanyahu said he and his family had paid ``a heavy personal
price,'' and that in addition there was a national price _ the
fomenting of hatred that ``destroys Israeli society and brings us
down.
	   ``It's time to stop it,'' he said. ``Enough.''

After Hiddink departure, search begins for a new Dutch coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch soccer authorities Thursday
began the search for a new national team coach after Guus Hiddink,
who steered the Netherlands to the World Cup semifinals, moved to
Spain's Real Madrid.
	   Media speculation immediately homed in on a trio of possible
candidates: former Celtic boss Wim Jansen, Barcelona coach Louis
van Gaal and Johan Cruyff, the former Ajax and Barcelona coach who
currently earns a living as a soccer analyst on Dutch television.
	   But officials at the Royal Dutch Soccer Association (KNVB) were
not naming names.
	   ``There is no great haste,'' said KNVB spokeswoman Petra van
Rooij. ``In the coming weeks we will work on a profile for our new
coach and then we will look for possible names.''
	   As co-hosts, with Belgium, of the European Championships in
2000, the Dutch do not have to play in the tournament's
qualification phase.
	   Hiddink will be a tough act to follow. After four years in Dutch
soccer's top job, he led his talent-packed squad to a nail-biting
World Cup semifinal with Brazil only to see his team lose on
penalties after drawing the match 1-1 in regulation and extra time.
	   In France, Hiddink also managed to keep in check racial tensions
that had split almost the same group of players at the 1996
European Championship finals.
	   Living legend Cruyff is the likely choice of many Dutch soccer
fans to succeed Hiddink, but the enigmatic star of the 1974
``Clockwork Orange'' team that lost the World Cup final to West
Germany has a tempestuous relationship with the nation's soccer
authorities and says his coaching days are over.
	   Van Gaal, who pulled the strings of the all-conquering Ajax
Amsterdam team of 1995, makes no secret of his desire to coach the
national team but he has recently extended his contract with
Barcelona after winning Spain's coveted league title in his first
season.
	   Jansen, who played alongside Cruyff in the 1974 final and was
also in the Dutch team that lost the 1978 World Cup final to
Argentina, guided Scotland's Glasgow Celtic to its first league
title in a decade last season before leaving the club amid
disagreements with directors over the amount of money available to
buy players. Cruyff has named him as a possible successor to
Hiddink.

German court asks for European ruling on women in military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ A German court asked the European Court
of Justice on Thursday to decide whether the German army's policy
of allowing women to serve only in the medical or music services
violates the European Union's anti-discrimination code.
	   The administrative court in Hanover asked for a decision in the
case of Tanja Kreil, who volunteered for the Bundeswehr in 1996,
seeking assignment as an electrician.
	   She was not accepted because German law forbids women from
serving in areas where they might have to fight.
	   European Union guidelines adopted in 1976 forbid discrimination
based on sex.

Young lawmakers' revolt delays vote on Hashimoto replacement

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Moves by ruling party leaders to whisk their
candidate into the prime minister's office faltered Thursday amid
noisy opposition from junior lawmakers and a reported challenge by
a reform-minded rival.
	   The immediate result was a three-day delay _ until July 24 _ in
the Liberal Democratic Party's planned vote to choose a replacement
for Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who announced his resignation
the day after the LDP's stunning electoral defeat on Sunday.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi had appeared to have key support
in the race to become party leader and thus, because of the party's
control of Parliament's lower house, prime minister.
	   But the apparent choice of Obuchi, a staid party veteran, drew
fire from the Japanese media, which said the public was fed up with
backroom deals and was awaiting strong leadership to lift the
stagnant economy.
	   In a meeting Thursday, junior LDP lawmakers joined the chorus of
disapproval, calling for a more transparent decision-making process
and for candidates to come forward with a clear vision for the
future.
	   ``There's a problem with the way our party chooses its
president,'' LDP lower house representative Tsutomu Hakebe told a
gathering of all LDP members of Parliament. ``The voters are
demanding an open debate.''
	   Seiroku Kajiyama, a longtime critic of Hashimoto's economic
policies and a champion of big tax cuts, told party elders he will
challenge Obuchi for the top job, Japanese media reported. He was
expected to make a formal announcement Friday.
	   The report boosted financial markets, sending the benchmark
Nikkei stock index up 0.71 percent and causing the yen to gain
sharply against the U.S. dollar.
	   ``The market loves Kajiyama and hates Obuchi,'' said Takashi
Nakauchi, foreign exchange manager at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
``Obuchi has a lot of power in the LDP, but he has no record on
finance.''
	   National broadcaster NHK said Kajiyama's bid has caused some LDP
factions to waver in their previous support for the foreign
minister.
	   Former Deputy Prime Minister Yohei Kono, tipped as a possible
contender, also reportedly said he would support Kajiyama's
candidacy.
	   Still, Obuchi's position remained strong because he heads the
LDP's largest faction and has the backing of the party's main power
broker, former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
	   Most analysts agree the LDP's weekend defeat in elections for
half the seats in Parliament's upper house was a stunning rebuke by
voters for Hashimoto's handling of Japan's recession-bound economy.
	   At Thursday's LDP meeting, younger party members openly
expressed outrage over the party's apparent willingness to back
Obuchi without his even making a public statement about what he
would do to turn the economy around.
	   ``We don't even know the policies of the people we're supposed
to be voting for,'' LDP lawmaker Taro Kono, 35, said after
Thursday's meeting.
	   Other lawmakers expressed concern that a failure by the LDP to
change its ways could lead to another rout at the polls _ and loss
of control of the Cabinet, something that has only happened once in
the last 43 years.
	   ``If we don't pay more attention to the voters' voice, we're in
trouble,'' said LDP lawmaker Makiko Tanaka, 54, one of the party's
sharpest internal critics.
	   ``But at this point, we're just throwing forth candidates like
we were running a garage sale.''

Serbian police bursts into ethnic Albanian headquarters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with new details throughout; US envoy present
during raid; CORRECTS number of reported casualties &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police for the first time
raided the headquarters of Kosovo's main Albanian political party
Thursday moments after members adjourned the first meeting of their
elected but unauthorized parliament.
	   No arrests were made during the half-hour operation, in which 20
heavily armed riot police and 10 plainclothed officers seized
documents in the drab headquarters building in the heart of the
provincial capital.
	   Police did not enter the building until after party leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, had taken his oath as president of the self-styled
Republic of Kosovo and the delegates were leaving.
	   There was no official explanation for the police action. The
government considers the Albanian parliament illegal, and the raid
could have been a warning not to continue to build such
institutions.
	   On the other hand, the fact that police waited until the meeting
was over suggested that the government was not seriously attempting
to muzzle Rugova, whom the United States and the Europeans see as
the Albanian leader most acceptable to head future peace talks with
the government.
	   U.S. envoy Chris Hill, the American ambassador to Macedonia,
witnessed the raid but U.S. officials had comment.
	   In an authorized election March 22, ethnic Albanians, who
compromise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people, elected the
120-seat self-styled parliament and chose Rugova as president.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo holds 90 percent of the
seats because most of the 15 other Albanian parties boycotted the
election.
	   ``The police action wasn't brutal, but it was very swift,''
Nekibe Kelmendi, the general secretary of Rugova's party, told
reporters. ``They gave us a two-minute ultimatum to hand them the
documents from the constitutional session, which we did.''
	   Kelmendi said the formation of the Kosovo parliament was ``a
historic act and the result of a new reality in the region which
the international community will have to consider.''
	   Serbia, which together with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia, has
rejected any moves toward independence for the province. The United
States and European nations support autonomy but not independence
as demanded by Albanians, including the extremist Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Hundreds have been killed since the government began a crackdown
on the KLA in late February.
	   On Wednesday, Serb and ethnic Albanian media outlets reported
scattered clashes which left 14 Serb policemen wounded, four ethnic
Albanians killed and four Albanians wounded.

Asia's developing nations preach caution on foreign investment

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Opinion leaders from 16 Asian developing
nations preached caution on foreign investment but reached no
consensus Thursday on whether to offer unrestricted access to
foreign corporations.
	   The developing nations agreed that they wanted mandatory
transfers of technology from multinational corporations when
investments are made in local markets, according to a statement
released after the two-day talks on international investment
arrangements.
	   ``Participants ... have been of the view that host developing
countries should exercise discretion to selectively permit foreign
direct investment in priority areas in line with their national
development objectives,'' the Indian government said in a
statement.
	   India hosted the meeting of government officials, industry
leaders and nongovernmental organizations with the U.N. Conference
on Trade and Development to discuss international investment.
	   U.N. officials said the conference was to familiarize developing
nations with existing investment arrangements. The discussions were
closed to the press.
	   Experts explained the options available to governments _ ranging
from regulating which companies to let into the market to keeping
certain areas of the economy off-limits.
	   ``The views expressed ranged from the opinion that there was no
need for an international investment regime that was legally
binding, to the view that bilateral investment promotion agreements
were sufficient to enhance FDI flows,'' the statement said.
	   The participating countries were Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, North
Korea, South Korea, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Maldives, Mongolia,
Nepal, Pakistan, The Philippines, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand
and Vietnam.
	   In April this year, trade and finance ministers from the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which
comprises the world's richest nations, postponed for six months
negotiations talks on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment,
which would set international rules for billions of investment
dollars.

Reds agreed terms for Swedish forward
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United has agreed to hire
Swedish international forward Jesper Blomqvist from Italy's Parma.
	   The two clubs agreed terms Thursday after the Reds reportedly
offered to pay some 5 million pounds (dlrs 8.35 million).
Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said he hopes that the
24-year-old player will finalize the deal next week.
	   ``The boy has gone back to Parma for talks with his club. I
expect him to be back next week when we expect to conclude the
deal,'' Ferguson said.
	   If Blomqvist signs, he will be Ferguson's second big import
during the summer following the acquisition of Dutch World Cup
defender Jaap Stam for 10 million pounds (dlrs 16.7 million).
	   United is in need of some new names on the squad after
squandering a 12-point lead in the Premier League last season and
losing the title to Arsenal.
	   Blomqvist, formerly with IFK Goteborg and AC Milan, can play on
either flank.

Talks go down to wire; US mounts full-court press
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Negotiators struggling to forge the world's first
permanent war crimes tribunal have struck a deal on forced
pregnancy, one of a host of thorny issues that threatened to
torpedo the U.N. talks.
	   An agreement was also reached on funding the court, the Bosnian
ambassador to the United Nations said Thursday.
	   With just a day left in the marathon talks, delegates from 160
countries were haggling right down to the wire.
	   The month-long conference ends on Friday and it appeared likely
delegates would make their final decision on the treaty at the
eleventh hour.
	   As envisioned, the court would bring individuals to justice for
genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   A funding deal hammered out Thursday calls for the countries
which are party to the treaty to pay the court's expenses.
	   Bosnian Ambassador Muhamed Sacirbey said a deal was also struck
this week on adding forced pregnancy to the list of war crimes the
court would prosecute.
	   The issue is of special importance to Bosnia, where tens of
thousands of women were raped during the civil war, then imprisoned
until they gave birth. Most of the victims were Muslims and Croats;
their attackers were Serbs bent on reshaping the ethnic landscape
of the former Yugoslavia.
	   There was broad agreement at the conference on including rape as
a war crime. But the Vatican and Arab countries resisted including
forced pregnancy, saying they felt that by endorsing the idea that
it was a crime to force a woman to go through with a pregnancy
would be an implict endorsement of the right to end it with an
abortion.
	   Sacirbey said a compromise was reached in a meeting of
representatives of the Vatican, Qatar, Bahrain, Iran, Bosnia, New
Zealand, Australia and the United States.
	   The participants agreed to phrase the new court's statute in
such as way as to avoid implying it supersedes national laws
prohibiting abortion, he said.
	   The United States, meanwhile, was mounting a full-court press to
limit the court's jurisdiction. According to some conference
participants, the heavy pressure was paying off and it appeared
some nations might bend to the American position rather than craft
a treaty the United States would reject out of hand.
	   The United States wants countries to be able to opt out of the
court's jurisdiction over war crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   Many say this would cripple the court and resistance to the idea
had been strong, especially among Western democracies.
	   The pressure is coming from the very top. President Bill Clinton
personally lobbied Italian Premier Romano Prodi to urge other
countries to make concessions to the United States. The United
Nations' human rights commissioner, Mary Robinson, waded into the
fray, urging delegates to hold firm.
	   ``Delegates must not give in to pressure for an 'opt-in/opt-out'
regime for war crimes and crimes against humanity,'' she wrote in a
letter made available Thursday.
	   Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy flew to Rome to
give a push to efforts for a strong court. Canada has carried the
banners for as powerful a court as possible.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A longer than usual summer flood season has
killed 760 people and caused more than 47 billion yuan (dlrs 5.6
billion) in economic losses in China, the state-run Xinhua News
Agency reported Thursday.
	   The Ministry of Civil Affairs, which handles disaster relief
operations, said heavy rains had caused flooding across 13
provinces and regions since May, Xinhua reported.
	   Flooding destroyed more than 1.4 million houses and 4.7 million
hectares (11.6 million acres) of farmland, Xinhua said. The
ministry has sent 100 million yuan (dlrs 12 million) in relief
funds and several thousand tents to the affected areas.
	   In one accident partly attributed to heavy rains, at least 14
people died and 40 were missing from a ferry accident on the upper
Yangtze River in Sichuan province, Xinhua said in a separate
report.
	   The ferry collided with a cargo ship and overturned on Sunday.
Passengers were quickly swept downstream by the rain-swollen
current, the report said.
	   Because the flood season began earlier than usual, some areas
have been inundated more than once, Xinhua said. Although the
report did not given an explanation for the lengthy flood season,
government meteorologists have previously blamed the El Nino
weather phenomenon.

	   Yaho was charged with drug smuggling.
	   Drug and illegal arms trafficking from Albania has increased in

After Hiddink departure, search begins for a new Dutch coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE CORDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch soccer authorities Thursday
began the search for a new national team coach after Guus Hiddink,
who steered the Netherlands to the World Cup semifinals, moved to
Spain's Real Madrid.
	   Media speculation immediately homed in on a trio of possible
candidates: former Celtic boss Wim Jansen, Barcelona coach Louis
van Gaal and Johan Cruyff, the former Ajax and Barcelona coach who
currently earns a living as a soccer analyst on Dutch television.
	   But officials at the Royal Dutch Soccer Association (KNVB) were
not naming names.
	   ``There is no great haste,'' said KNVB spokeswoman Petra van
Rooij. ``In the coming weeks we will work on a profile for our new
coach and then we will look for possible names.''
	   As co-hosts, with Belgium, of the European Championships in
2000, the Dutch do not have to play in the tournament's
qualification phase.
	   Hiddink will be a tough act to follow. After four years in Dutch
soccer's top job, he led his talent-packed squad to a nail-biting
World Cup semifinal with Brazil only to see his team lose on
penalties after drawing the match 1-1 in regulation and extra time.
	   In France, Hiddink also managed to keep in check racial tensions
that had split almost the same group of players at the 1996
European Championship finals.
	   Living legend Cruyff is the likely choice of many Dutch soccer
fans to succeed Hiddink, but the enigmatic star of the 1974
``Clockwork Orange'' team that lost the World Cup final to West
Germany has a tempestuous relationship with the nation's soccer
authorities and says his coaching days are over.
	   Van Gaal, who pulled the strings of the all-conquering Ajax
Amsterdam team of 1995, makes no secret of his desire to coach the
national team but he has recently extended his contract with
Barcelona after winning Spain's coveted league title in his first
season.
	   Jansen, who played alongside Cruyff in the 1974 final and was
also in the Dutch team that lost the 1978 World Cup final to
Argentina, guided Scotland's Glasgow Celtic to its first league
title in a decade last season before leaving the club amid
disagreements with directors over the amount of money available to
buy players. Cruyff has named him as a possible successor to
Hiddink.

Netanyahu lashes out at critics: `It hurts'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS graf with background on Rabin assassination &QL; 
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained
Thursday that he has been subjected to a relentless campaign of
personal attacks by opponents who have not spared his wife, his
children or his friends.
	   ``There is a personal price,'' Netanyahu said in an unexpected
outpouring at what was supposed to be a brief appearance before
photographers. ``It's not true that I have the skin of an elephant.
There is a personal price _ and it hurts.''
	   The latest attack on the prime minister came this week when an
opposition legislator called for an investigation of allegations
that Netanyahu had tried to influence the judge in a high-profile
treason case. The legislator, Nissim Zvili, has since withdrawn the
demand, saying he accepted the judge's denial. Netanyahu also
denied having had contact with the judge.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday blamed ``elements in the opposition,'' who
he said ``took advantage of this ugly opportunity to discredit me
... even at the expense of the good name of a judge and at the cost
of undermining confidence in the Israeli judicial system.
	   ``If I ever thought there was a limit to how low my opponents
were willing to go, it turns out I was wrong,'' he said.
	   ``This is not a thing of a day or two,'' he added, speaking
slowly and emotionally. ``In the past few years, I have been the
target of insults, ridicule, lies, jabs, and baseless claims. I, my
wife and my children, my colleagues serve as targets of stories
that never existed.
	   ``These things have one name: character assassination.''
	   Netanyahu's bitter attack seemed disproportionate to the
accusations made against him this week, although it was not the
first time he has claimed to be the victim of a conspiracy by
opponents who have never accepted his election.
	   Netanyahu said he and his family had paid ``a heavy personal
price,'' and that in addition there was a national price _ the
fomenting of hatred that ``destroys Israeli society and brings us
down.
	   ``It's time to stop it,'' he said. ``Enough.''
	   As opposition leader, Netanyahu was accused of failing to
discourage his supporters from savage attacks on Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin that were blamed for helping create an atmosphere
that led to Rabin's assassination in 1995.

Government forms committee to work on international oil consortium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Ukraine's government formed a committee to
work on the creation of an international consortium that would
complete an oil pipeline and Black Sea oil terminal, a top industry
official said Thursday.
	   The consortium, to include international oil giants that
participate in the development of Caspian Sea deposits, is intended
to make the shipment of Azerbaijani oil to Europe through Ukraine
more attractive, said Valery Shuliko, deputy head of the State Oil
and Gas Committee.
	   The government committee is to work out terms of inviting
foreign companies to the consortium, and determine what stakes they
can hold in the venture. Shuliko said the government wants to
retain at least a 25 percent stake.
	   Ukraine, along with Russia, Turkey, Georgia and Iran, is eager
to transport Caspian Sea oil from huge Azerbaijani deposits to the
West.
	   The country has suggested that Caspian oil be taken by tankers
from the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa to the Black Sea port of
Odessa, where a big oil terminal is currently under construction.
	   From there, the oil will flow via a pipeline _ also under
construction _ to the western Ukrainian town of Brody for export.
	   Shuliko said Ukraine plans to ask a large international
consulting firm to help develop the structure and other details of
the project.
	   He said Ukraine can complete the terminal and pipeline on its
own, but participation of the oil companies developing Caspian
deposits would provide more guarantees that they eventually choose
the Ukrainian route.
	   Ukraine needs dlrs 200 million to complete the pipeline and dlrs
150 million to finish the terminal, Shuliko said.
	   The pipeline, which would transport 30 million tons of oil
annually, is already half-finished, but the terminal, with a
planned capacity of more than 50 million tons a year, is only 20
percent completed, he added.

Turkish club, Taffarel at odds over transfer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish league champion Galatasaray said
Thursday that snags prevented it finalizing a contract with
Brazilian goalkeeper Taffarel for next season.
	   The Istanbul-based Galatasaray signed a preliminary two-year
contract with Taffarel on June 24 in Paris for dlrs 1.5 million.
	   He immediately won the hearts of Galatasaray fans after saving
two penalty kicks in the World Cup semifinal with the Netherlands,
taking Brazil to the final.
	   But his popularity will be ruined if he pulls out of the deal
over pay disputes.
	   ``Taffarel either accepts our conditions or this job ends
here,'' Galatasaray president Faruk Suren was quoted as saying in
the daily Hurriyet.
	   Taffarel is demanding dlrs 10,000 for each match even if he does
not play. The club is only willing to pay this amount for two games
it plays without him.
	   There is also disagreement over the amount Galatasaray can
demand from the next club that buys Taffarel.
	   Suren also said that Galatasaray would ask for dlrs 1.5 million
from any club which wanted to transfer Taffarel at the end of his
contract. Taffarel wants the amount to be halved.
	   But Galatasaray coach Fatih Terim assured fans, saying ``Don't
worry, Taffarel will come.''
	   In the 1994 World Cup Taffarel only conceded three goals, in
which Brazil won an unprecedented fourth title. But his standout
performances his year could not prevent Brasil's 3-0 defeat by
France in the final.
	   Galatasaray finished last season with a 23-6-5 record and 75
points, four points ahead of rival Fenerbahce.

Houllier appointed joint manager at Liverpool

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Former French national team coach
Gerard Houllier became the fourth foreign manager in the English
Premier League when he was appointed joint manager at Liverpool on
Thursday.
	   Houllier, 50, signed a two-year deal to work alongside current
Reds manager Roy Evans.
	   Arsene Wenger, another Frenchman, steered Arsenal to the League
and FA Cup double last season and has become one of the most
sought-after managers in the game.
	   Italy's Gianluca Vialli took the helm at Chelsea midway through
last season, leading the Blues to a League Cup and European Cup
Winners' Cup double.
	   Christian Gross, the Swiss manager in charge at Tottenham
Hotspur, makes up the quartet of foreign managers in the League.
	   Houllier, France's national technical director, finished his
contract with the French soccer federation after France's World Cup
win on Sunday and had been considering an offer to move to Scottish
club Celtic.
	   He will work in tandem with Evans following the retirement
Wednesday of chief coach Ronnie Moran _ the man dubbed ``Mr.
Liverpool'' after 50 years service to the club.
	   Houllier described his appointment as an ``original and modern
blending of two men's experience.''
	   ``We are fully aware of how it may sometimes appear difficult
for us, but first of all neither of us has got an ego and we are
here for the club, the players and to bring trophies to Anfield,''
he said.
	   ``It is all about teamwork.''
	   Evans, who said he was happy with the new management set-up,
confirmed Doug Livermore would remain assistant manager.
	   ``There will be some problems and some things which we will have
to iron out _ that's for sure. But the relationship we will have is
something to look forward to but not something to fear,'' he said.
	   Houllier coached Lens and Paris St. Germain before taking over
from Michel Platini as national coach after Euro '92. He resigned
in December 1993, a month after the French lost 2-1 to Bulgaria in
Paris and failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup.
	   Aime Jacquet, who steered France to World Cup glory on Sunday,
was his successor.
	   Houllier rejected offers from Scottish League champions, Celtic,
and Everton to join the Reds.
	   Celtic had been negotiating with Houllier and was confident of
ending its 10-week wait for a manager to replace Wim Jansen, who
resigned after taking the club to its first Scottish title in a
decade on May 9.
	   Celtic supporters' club president Peter Rafferty said Celtic
were disillusioned and disappointed that Houllier had joined
Liverpool.
	   ``Houllier was a coach of high caliber and his decision to join
Liverpool is not good for Celtic's image,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ A fishing boat believed to be from
Indonesia evaded capture by Australia's navy this week after a
running battle in which several shots were fired and a patrol boat
was repeatedly rammed, a defense forces spokesman said Thursday.
	   The 42-meter (138-foot) patrol boat HMAS Cessnock tried to
capture a 35-meter (115-foot) fishing vessel spotted by an air
patrol in Australia's economic exclusion zone, said the spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   ``The crew from Cessnock tried to board the fishing vessel and
obviously they didn't cooperate,'' the spokesman added.
	   As the navy ship tried to come alongside, ``there were several
attempts to ram Cessnock and some were successful,'' he said.
``There was no serious damage to Cessnock and it managed to evade
other attempts to ram it.''
	   As it became clear the fishing vessel would not surrender,
Cessnock opened fire.
	   ``It was the usual graduated response they were trained to
apply,'' the spokesman said. ``The first shots are rifles, then
they go up o .50-caliber machine guns and then the big Bofors
(antiaircraft guns).''
	   The fishing boat still would not stop and the chase was called
off when it left Australian waters.
	   The spokesman did not say exactly when the chase occurred.

Ronaldo could be epileptic, physician says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Ronaldo, the star forward of
Brazil's national soccer team who has recently suffered from
seizures, could suffer from epilepsy, the team physician said.
	   Ronaldo suffered between 30 and 40 seconds of convulsions just
hours before Brazil lost 3-0 in the World Cup final match against
France on Sunday, leading many in Brazil wondering whether Ronaldo
should have played in the game at all.
	   ``Whenever a person suffers from stress and is epileptic, it
could cause a crisis,'' team doctor Lidio Toledo told Globo
television.
	   But Toledo was quick to add that the exact cause of Ronaldo's
convulsions are not yet confirmed. The French doctors who treated
Ronaldo on Sunday were quoted in O Globo newspaper as saying that
they did not believe Ronaldo was suffering from epilepsy.
	   The decision to allow Ronaldo to play in Sunday's game drew
criticism from Massimo Moratti, the owner of Ronaldo's Italian
club, who said team coach Mario Zagallo should have kept him on the
bench during the World Cup final.

German court asks for European ruling on women in military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ A German court asked the European Court
of Justice on Thursday to decide whether the German army's policy
of allowing women to serve only in the medical or music services
violates the European Union's anti-discrimination code.
	   The administrative court in Hanover asked for a decision in the
case of Tanja Kreil, who volunteered for the Bundeswehr in 1996,
seeking assignment as an electrician.
	   She was not accepted because German law forbids women from
serving in areas where they might have to fight.
	   European Union guidelines adopted in 1976 forbid discrimination
based on sex.

Festina team director suspended; he and doctor still in detention
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prime minister's comments, doctor's comments in
L'Equipe. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHOLET, France (AP) _ The cloud over the Tour de France was
growing quickly Thursday with the suspension of Festina team
director Bruno Roussel due to a worsening drug controversy.
	   The International Cycling Union announced Thursday morning, just
before the start of the Tour's fifth stage, that Roussel had failed
to respond adequately to an investigation from the French Cycling
Federation.
	   It said it had suspended his cycling license, and therefore he
will not be able to work on the Tour de France.
	   But Jean-Marie LeBlanc, the Tour de France director, said there
was no reason to suspend the team from competing for the moment.
The police conducted a search of the riders' rooms on Wednesday.
	   Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were still in detention in
Cholet, after being taken in for questioning by police following
Wednesday's stage.
	   Police from the northern city of Lille came down to conduct the
investigation. That's where a Belgian member of the Festina team
has been under arrest since last week, when he was found with a
stash of performance-enhancing drugs in a team car.
	   Ryckaert told the L'Equipe newspaper he was ``broken'' by the
allegations, and staunchly denied any involvement in doping.
	   ``My wife knows me, and she knows that everything they are
saying about me is a serious lie,'' he said.
	   The scandal was on the front page of virtually all French
newspapers Thursday, and it evoked comment from as high up as the
prime minister.
	   Lionel Jospin said he'd seen ``with sadness _ but not total
surprise _ the news that people without scruples wanted to give
cyclists, and surely did, forbidden doping products, difficult or
impossible to detect, and at the same time certainly very dangerous
for athletes' health.''
	   He said it was essential ``that light be shed, and conclusions
drawn.''
	   ``The Tour is Derailed,'' headlined the Liberation daily.
``Police at the Finish Line,'' said Le Parisien. ``It's Going
Badly,'' said France-Soir. ``The Tour Poisoned,'' said Le Figaro.
	   The media was also full of comments by doctors and others saying
they'd expected such a scandal to happen some day.
	   ``This Festina affair doesn't surprise me at all,'' said Dr. Guy
Zerhat, former doctor for the Bic cycling team in the 1970s.
	   ``I am happy it is breaking out today, in everyone's interest,
beginning with the cyclists themselves,'' he said on France 3
television.
	   He said that when he treated members of various teams, ``I saw
horrible things. I saw boys inject themselves during the race.''
	   Another doctor, specializing in doping, said the practice is
``part of daily life.''
	   ``The athlete has simply appropriated a practice that is
widespread in other fields,'' said Dr. Patrick Laure in an
interview with the daily ``L'Est Republicain.''
	   The Festina team issued a statement Wednesday saying Roussel
wished to be heard.
	   He got his wish later, when police officially detained him.
French law allows detention of up to 48 hours before further
action.
	   Festina's main sponsors, the Spanish watch company Festina, are
threatening to break their contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

German driver close to contract extension with Ferrari
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONZA, Italy (AP) _ Formula One driver Michael Schumacher said
Thursday he was very close to a contract extension with the Italian
team Ferrari.
	   ``We are close to signing it, but I can't tell when I'll sign,''
the two-time world champion said at the Monza circuit where he has
been testing his Ferrari car for the next world championship races.
	   According to published reports in Italy, the German driver was
prepared to extend his contract with Ferrari for three years,
through 2002.
	   His current contract, granting him more than 40 billion lire
(dlrs 22 million) a year, expires in 1999.
	   Schumacher, who won his third consecutive Grand Prix this season
at Silverstone last Sunday, said he was confident to clinch the
1998 world drivers title as his Ferrari ``is very competitive.''
	   In morning practice the German driver was 0.7 seconds off the
fastest lap clocked by his McLaren-Mercedes rival Mika Hakkinen.
	   Hakkinen leads Schumacher by only two points going into the next
Grand Prix of Austria, on July 26.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Romanian World Cup striker Viorel
Moldovan has joined Istanbul's Fenerbahce from England's Coventry
City, reports said Thursday.

Netanyahu lashes out at critics: `It hurts'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HILARY APPELMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu complained
Thursday that he has been subjected to a relentless campaign of
personal attacks by opponents who have not spared his wife, his
children or his friends.
	   ``There is a personal price,'' Netanyahu said in an unexpected
outpouring at what was supposed to be a brief appearance before
photographers. ``It's not true that I have the skin of an elephant.
There is a personal price _ and it hurts.''
	   The latest attack on the prime minister came this week when an
opposition legislator called for an investigation of allegations
that Netanyahu had tried to influence the judge in a high-profile
treason case. The legislator, Nissim Zvili, has since withdrawn the
demand, saying he accepted the judge's denial. Netanyahu also
denied having had contact with the judge.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday blamed ``elements in the opposition,'' who
he said ``took advantage of this ugly opportunity to discredit me
... even at the expense of the good name of a judge and at the cost
of undermining confidence in the Israeli judicial system.
	   ``If I ever thought there was a limit to how low my opponents
were willing to go, it turns out I was wrong,'' he said.
	   ``This is not a thing of a day or two,'' he added, speaking
slowly and emotionally. ``In the past few years, I have been the
target of insults, ridicule, lies, jabs, and baseless claims. I, my
wife and my children, my colleagues serve as targets of stories
that never existed.
	   ``These things have one name: character assassination.''
	   Netanyahu's bitter attack seemed disproportionate to the
accusations made against him this week, although it was not the
first time he has claimed to be the victim of a conspiracy by
opponents who have never accepted his election.
	   Netanyahu said he and his family had paid ``a heavy personal
price,'' and that in addition there was a national price _ the
fomenting of hatred that ``destroys Israeli society and brings us
down.
	   ``It's time to stop it,'' he said. ``Enough.''
	   As opposition leader, Netanyahu was accused of failing to
discourage his supporters from savage attacks on Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin that were blamed for helping create an atmosphere
that led to Rabin's assassination in 1995.

Croatian, Yugoslav ministers to meet in August, discuss Prevlaka
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's southernmost peninsula
Prevlaka, the focus of the last major dispute between Croatia and
Yugoslavia, will top the agenda when the two foreign ministers meet
in mid-August, Foreign Minister Mate Granic said Thursday.
	   On Wednesday, the U.N. Security Council decided to keep a 28-man
observer mission in Prevlaka until Jan. 15 and voiced deep concern
over the two states' failure to settle the dispute over the
strategic peninsula.
	   Prevlaka controls access to the naval headquarters of
Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up today's Yugoslavia.
	   Yugoslavia would like to control Prevlaka to safeguard Boka
Kotorska, the adjacent Montenegro port, while Croatia is determined
not to give up its authority there.
	   ``The U.N. Security Council clearly recognizes Prevlaka as a
part of Croatia,'' Granic told reporters. ``We cannot accept any
other solution.''
	   After the 1991 war in which Yugoslavia backed the Croatian
minority Serbs' rebellion against Croatia's independence and
Prevlaka was briefly seized by Serbs, the two countries agreed to
let United Nations observers deploy in Prevlaka until they solve
the dispute. There has been no progress since.
	   Earlier this month, Croatia proposed the area to be
demilitarized. Yugoslavia wanted to keep U.N. observers there and
called for negotiations on who would control the peninsula.
	   Granic said the Yugoslav proposal was ``naturally, not
acceptable,'' but he welcomed it as a start of future talks.
	   He said Croatia is nevertheless ready to talk about the free
access to the Montenegro port and the naval demarcation line.

Ronaldo could be epileptic, physician says

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Ronaldo, the star forward of
Brazil's national soccer team who has recently suffered from
seizures, could suffer from epilepsy, the team physician said.
	   Ronaldo suffered between 30 and 40 seconds of convulsions just
hours before Brazil lost 3-0 in the World Cup final match against
France on Sunday, leading many in Brazil wondering whether Ronaldo
should have played in the game at all.
	   ``Whenever a person suffers from stress and is epileptic, it
could cause a crisis,'' team doctor Lidio Toledo told Globo
television.
	   But Toledo was quick to add that the exact cause of Ronaldo's
convulsions are not yet confirmed. The French doctors who treated
Ronaldo on Sunday were quoted in O Globo newspaper as saying that
they did not believe Ronaldo was suffering from epilepsy.
	   The decision to allow Ronaldo to play in Sunday's game drew
criticism from Massimo Moratti, the owner of Ronaldo's Italian
club, who said team coach Mario Zagallo should have kept him on the
bench during the World Cup final.

McCartney cancels trip to Liverpool to receive honorary degree
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Former Beatle Paul McCartney says he
will be unable to attend a graduation ceremony next week where he
was due to receive an honorary fellowship, because he is still
grieving over the death of his wife.
	   After Linda McCartney died of breast cancer in April, McCartney
canceled most public appearances, but he had agreed to attend the
ceremony Tuesday at John Moores University in Liverpool, his
hometown, university spokeswoman Janet Martin said.
	   ``Although we are disappointed that he no longer feels able to
go through with the event, we fully understand his reasons,'' she
said Thursday. ``It is quite a long ceremony and Sir Paul would
have been watched by a lot of people attending.''
	   McCartney had accepted the fellowship three years ago, Ms.
Martin said. He had waited until this year to attend the ceremony,
so he could watch the first students graduate from the Liverpool
Institute of Performing Arts, one of his brainchilds, she said.
	   The honorary fellowship is in recognition of the work he did to
help establish the school, Ms. Martin said.
	   The day McCartney would have been in Liverpool coincides with
the unveiling of his former home as a tourist attraction, but he
had no plans to attend the media preview.

airport could cost the territory's economy more than a third of a
percent this year and considerably disrupt external trade, the
government said Thursday.
	   A statement said the protracted cargo delays could result in a
loss of about 4.6 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 589
million), or 0.35 percent of Hong Kong's gross domestic product
this year. The new estimate was higher than the 0.1 percent figure
given last week by Financial Secretary Donald Tsang.
	   ``The longer the disruption, the greater will be the likelihood
of trade being diverted elsewhere,'' the government said.
	   After meeting late Thursday with members of the pro-China
Democratic Alliance for the Betterment of Hong Kong, Chief
Executive Tung Chee-hwa said the government's priority was to
``address the problems'' at the new airport.
	   ``I fully understand the public sentiment and concern over the
airport operations,'' Tung said in a statement.
	   Tung added that the members of an independent team to
investigate blunders at the airport will be announced later.
	   It was the first time since Chek Lap Kok's disastrous start on
July 6 that Tung had issued a statement on the airport's problems.
	   Late Wednesday, the airport's main cargo handler announced that
it would not be able to bring its facility at the new airport up to
full speed until the end of August. It had previously frozen all
cargo shipments until July 19.
	   Secretary for Trade and Industry Brian Chau said the cargo
limitations were unfair to small and medium businesses, the
backbone of Hong Kong's once-robust economy, especially at a time
when it is slipping into recession.
	   ``Like most Hong Kong people, I'm disappointed, and I'm angry,''
Chau told reporters. ``This shouldn't, and couldn't be happening.''
	   The company, Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals, ``should be
condemned,'' Chau said.
	   Legislator James Tien, chairman of the influential General
Chamber of Commerce, said some factories have been cutting
operating hours, and might have to lay off workers because of lack
of supplies from overseas.
	   Tien said manufacturers of toys and clothing would be the
hardest hit because August and September are their peak export
season.
	   Legislator Lee Cheuk-yan, secretary-general for the
Confederation of Trade Unions, said he worried that employers would
use this as an excuse to fire workers or cut wages during the
economic downturn.
	   Computer problems destroyed much of the handler's air cargo
data, forcing the closure.
	   Although the company largely has avoided finger-pointing, it
says it never promised to have the new site operating fully by
early July.
	   And the government has faced accusations that it pushed the
airport opening ahead too fast to coincide with the first
anniversary of the return to Chinese rule. Chinese President Jiang
Zemin visited on the anniversary, and dedicated the airport.
	   Air cargo shipments have resumed partially, and officials said
the new airport handled 2,437 tons of cargo Wednesday, about half
of normal. Passengers services are back to normal, officials said.
	   Hong Kong officials struck a deal Wednesday with the mainland
for airlines to use Huangtian airport in the bordering mainland
city of Shenzhen. Officials said Huangtian could handle up to 30
percent of the territory's usual cargo. Some airlines also have
been using the airport in the nearby Portuguese enclave of Macau.
	   Kenny Ku, vice president of the Association of Small and Medium
Businesses and a toy and gifts trader, said most members would use
the mainland airports only as a last resort because of inefficiency
and customs procedures.
	   Some members have been shipping cargo by sea to airports in the
Middle East, Singapore and Japan before re-routing them to Europe
and the United States, he said.
	   Traders are advising overseas clients to stop exporting, and
banks are tightening credit because of delayed shipments, he said.
Some cargo was stuck in overseas ports because airmail shipping
documents from Hong Kong were lost, he said.
	   However, there was general agreement that if the present
problems are fixed, Hong Kong's efficiency, capacity and openness
would likely secure its place as the region's cargo hub.

Questions and answers: What happened to the Romanovs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Russia-Czar's Burial &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Answers to common questions concerning the remains of Russia's
last royal family _ Nicholas II, Alexandra and their five children:
	   Q: How did they die?
	   A: The entire family along with their doctor and three
attendants were lined up against a wall in the basement of a house
in the Ural Mountains city of Yekaterinburg. A firing squad burst
into the room and opened fire, emptying the barrels of their guns.
Jewels sewn into the womens' corsets caused some of the bullets to
ricochet off. The squad used bayonets to finish them off.
	   Q: What happened to the bodies?
	   A: First they were stripped of clothes and jewels and then
dumped in a mine shaft outside town. Grenades were thrown into the
pit to try to destroy them. Rumors quickly circulated in town
identifying the site, so the following day the bodies were
retrieved and the squad set off for another site. When their truck
broke down, they decided to try to destroy the bodies by burning
them. They set fire to two of the smallest corpses _ the eldest son
Alexei and one of his sisters _ but it took a long time to burn
them. The revolutionaries were growing nervous and decided to bury
the rest of the bodies by the side of the road. They poured barrels
of sulfuric acid into the pit in the hope it would destroy the
remains.
	   Q: How were they found?
	   A: In the late 1970s, a local geologist and an interested
filmmaker pooled their resources, eventually obtaining an account
of the botched burial written by the leader of the squad in which
he identified the site. They found the site, dug into the pit, and
retrieved three skulls. Afraid of discovery, however, they later
replaced them and held onto their secret until Mikhail Gorbachev's
glasnost. In 1989, the filmmaker announced he had discovered the
bodies. In July 1991, the same month Boris Yeltsin became Russia's
first president, the bodies were exhumed.
	   Q: How were they identified?
	   A: Russian officials sent samples of the bones to Britain and
the United States for DNA testing. Those tests definitively
concluded that five of the skeletons were members of one family,
and four were unrelated. Of the five, three were the children of
the two parents. The mother was determined to be related to the
British royal family, as was Alexandra. The father was determined
to be related to several other Romanovs. Scientists have said the
accuracy of the identification is greater than 99 percent.
	   Q: Which are the two missing skeletons?
	   A: The body of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne, is
missing, as is one of his sisters, either Maria or Anastasia. One
American scientist using bone measurement techniques concluded that
the missing sister was Anastasia. But all other tests, including
facial reconstructions, have led investigators to conclude that the
missing skeleton is Maria. One of the coffins being buried Friday
is engraved with Anastasia's name.
	   Q: What about stories that Alexei or Anastasia escaped?
	   A: Hundreds of people have come forward over the years claiming
to be an escaped member of the royal family. None of the claims
have ever been proven, and claimants who have submitted to DNA
testing have been unrelated to the Romanovs. Perhaps the most
famous pretender, Anna Anderson, was determined by genetic testing
to be a Polish peasant named Franziska Schanzkowska.
	   Q: Why is the Russian Orthodox Church refusing to recognize the
bones as belonging to the czar and his family?
	   A: The debate is tied to larger battles within the church and
with Orthodox believers who have been living in exile since the
revolution. The exiled church has canonized the czar and has made
canonization by the Moscow patriarchate a precondition for
reunification _ which would significantly boost the church's
standing both within Russia and among other branches of Orthodoxy.
The Moscow-based church has started canonization proceedings, but
they are likely to take several more years. In the interim, if they
were to bury the czar without treating his remains as the holy
relics of a saint, the exiled church would take deep offense. Until
the Moscow patriarchate resolves the issue of canonization and
comes to an understanding on reunification with the exiled church,
it is unlikely to be able to move forward on identifying the bones.
	   Q: What will happen if the Russian Orthodox Church canonizes
Nicholas and the rest of the family?
	   A: According to Orthodox tradition, they will be exhumed,
ritually washed and dressed in sacred garments. After canonization
rites, they will be interred in special above-ground boxes known as
reliquaries, and their bones will be objects of veneration.

Judge rules against opponents of children's cancer home
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A judge has ruled against a residents'
group that tried to block construction of a home for children with
cancer because they claimed the sight of the young patients would
be too depressing, media reports said Thursday.
	   Twelve residents of Goudi in central Athens had sought an
injunction against plans for the guest house for young cancer
patients from around Greece. The nation's main children's hospital
is located in the Goudi district.
	   The group also claimed the guest house would constitute a health
hazard for local residents due to the ``various micro-organisms''
of cancer, media reports said.
	   Judge Charalambia Simou rejected all claims in the suit as being
``unfounded.''
	   ``There is no evidence of particular danger to ... the
applicants in any way,'' newspapers quoted the court decision as
saying.
	   The guest house is being built by an association of parents of
children with cancer.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prayers will be said for Princess Diana at
Westminster Abbey on the anniversaries of her death and of her
funeral.
	   ``It is the church's custom to remember the departed in
prayer,'' said a statement from the 900-year-old abbey church where
Diana's funeral was held Sept. 6.
	   ``Diana, Princess of Wales, and her families, will be remembered
during normal services'' on those days.'' the abbey said.
	   On Aug. 31, the anniversary of the Paris car crash that killed
Diana, Prince William and Prince Harry are to attend church near
Balmoral Castle in Scotland with their father, Prince Charles, and
other members of the royal family as well as Prime Minister Tony
Blair and his wife.
	   Members of the Spencer family are to hold a service at her grave
on an island at her ancestral home, Althorp.

Suharto, not IMF, must accept blame for Indonesia's crisis, says
</HEADLINE>
Roth &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Indonesia's flawed reforms were to
blame for the failure to stem the country's economic crisis, and
not the International Monetary Fund, a senior U.S. official said
Thursday.
	   A number of countries, including Australia, have accused the IMF
of adopting an inflexible approach to Indonesia, worsening the
country's crisis.
	   But Stanley Roth, the U.S. assistant secretary of state for East
Asia, said Indonesia had only itself to blame, particularly with
its now abandoned plan to try to fix its currency's exchange rate
through a currency board.
	   ``I simply wouldn't accept the problem is the heavy hand of the
IMF, as opposed to the rather flawed implementation of the
Indonesian government,'' Roth told Australian Broadcasting Corp.
television.
	   ``I think that that's had a lot to do with the failure of these
initial IMF agreements.
	   ``I mean the whole fiasco of the currency board, for example,
had nothing to do with the heavy hand of the IMF and everything to
do with Indonesia looking for a quick fix, to get out of the
problem painlessly and avoid making reforms.''
	   Roth said the overwhelming blame for Indonesia's problems rested
with former President Suharto.
	   He also said Japan had to take action to tackle enormous bad
debts held by Japanese banks before its economy could recover.
	   ``They have to find an effective means of dealing with this huge
overhang of debt they have,'' Roth said.
	   ``They can't just keep sitting on it, which is what has been
happening for ... quite a few years.''

Festina official suspended; Cipollin wins stage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; PRECEDE CHOLET
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with day's stage
 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAUROUX, France (AP) _ Mario Cipollini of Italy won the
fifth stage on the Tour de France but the race was under a growing
cloud Thursday, with the suspension of Bruno Roussel, the Festina
team director, due to the drug controversy that threatens the
event.
	   The International Cycling Union announced just before the start
of the Tour's fifth stage that Roussel had failed to respond
adequately to an investigation by the French Cycling Federation.
	   It said it had suspended his cycling license, and therefore he
will not be able to work on the Tour de France.
	   Roussel and team doctor Erik Ryckaert were still in detention
Thursday in Cholet.
	   Cipollini won the final sprint Thursday over the other top
sprinter of the race, Erik Zabel of Germany. Third was Christophe
Mengin of France.
	   Most of the pack finished in the same time allowing Stuart
O'Grady of Australia to hold on to the yellow jersey after the leg
from Cholet to Chateauroux in central France.
	   But the attention Thursday was on the growing drug controversy.
	   On Wednesday, the Festina team issued a statement saying it was
Roussel's wish to be heard.
	   He got that wish later, when police offically detained him for
questioning. French law allows up to 48 hours before any further
action.
	   Last week, a Belgian masseur for Festina was arrested after
police found a large quantity of performance-enhancing drugs in his
team car.
	   According to judicial sources, after first saying the drugs were
for his personal use, the man charged said he was under team
orders.
	   Festina officials denied those accusations and said that they
had hired two lawyers to protect their image and riders.
	   Festina's main sponsor, the watch company of the same name, was
threatening to break its contract with the team if there is any
evidence of drug use among the riders.

Serbian police bursts into ethnic Albanian headquarters

 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with new details throughout; US envoy present

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police for the first time
raided the headquarters of Kosovo's main Albanian political party
on Thursday, moments after members adjourned the first meeting of
their elected but unauthorized parliament.
	   No arrests were made during the half-hour operation, in which 20
heavily armed riot police and 10 plainclothed officers seized
documents in the drab headquarters building in the heart of the
provincial capital.
	   Police did not enter the building until after party leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, had taken his oath as president of the self-styled
Republic of Kosovo and the delegates were leaving.
	   There was no official explanation for the police action. The
government considers the Albanian parliament illegal, and the raid
could have been a warning not to continue to build such
institutions.
	   On the other hand, the fact that police waited until the meeting
was over suggested that the government was not seriously attempting
to muzzle Rugova, whom the United States and the Europeans see as
the Albanian leader most acceptable to head future peace talks with
the government.
	   U.S. envoy Chris Hill, the American ambassador to Macedonia,
witnessed the raid but U.S. officials had no comment.
	   In an authorized election March 22, ethnic Albanians, who
compromise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million people, elected the
120-seat self-styled parliament and chose Rugova as president.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo holds 90 percent of the
seats because most of the 15 other Albanian parties boycotted the
election.
	   ``The police action wasn't brutal, but it was very swift,''
Nekibe Kelmendi, the general secretary of Rugova's party, told
reporters. ``They gave us a two-minute ultimatum to hand them the
documents from the constitutional session, which we did.''
	   Kelmendi said the formation of the Kosovo parliament was ``a
historic act and the result of a new reality in the region which
the international community will have to consider.''
	   Serbia, which together with Montenegro forms Yugoslavia, has
rejected any moves toward independence for the province. The United
States and European nations support autonomy but not independence
as demanded by Albanians, including the extremist Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Hundreds have been killed since the government began a crackdown
on the KLA in late February.
	   On Wednesday, Serb and ethnic Albanian media outlets reported
scattered clashes which left 14 Serb policemen wounded, four ethnic
Albanians killed and four Albanians wounded.

Shevardnadze in hospital for checkup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
checked into the central military hospital Thursday for a medical
checkup, a presidential spokeswoman said.
	   According to spokeswoman Lela Bakhturidze, Shevardnadze was
undergoing routine tests as part of a physical exam.
	   Russian television reported that Shevardnadze had undergone a
minor operation for prostate problems, but the report could not be
confirmed.
	   Shevardnadze narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in
February, when gunmen opened fire on the president's motorcade. Two
bodyguards were killed, but Shevardnadze was unharmed.
	   Afterward, Shevardnadze asserted that his physical health had
never been better.

retrieved and the squad set off for another site. When their truck
broke down, they decided to try to destroy the bodies by burning
them. They set fire to two of the smallest corpses _ the eldest son
Alexei and one of his sisters _ but it took a long time to burn
them. The revolutionaries were growing nervous and decided to bury
the rest of the bodies by the side of the road. They poured barrels
of sulfuric acid into the pit in the hope it would destroy the
remains.
	   Q: How were they found?
	   A: In the late 1970s, a local geologist and an interested
filmmaker pooled their resources, eventually obtaining an account
of the botched burial written by the leader of the squad in which
he identified the site. They found the site, dug into the pit, and
retrieved three skulls. Afraid of discovery, however, they later
replaced them and held onto their secret until Mikhail Gorbachev's
glasnost. In 1989, the filmmaker announced he had discovered the
bodies. In July 1991, the same month Boris Yeltsin became Russia's
first president, the bodies were exhumed.
	   Q: How were they identified?
	   A: Russian officials sent samples of the bones to Britain and
the United States for DNA testing. Those tests definitively
concluded that five of the skeletons were members of one family,
and four were unrelated. Of the five, three were the children of
the two parents. The mother was determined to be related to the
British royal family, as was Alexandra. The father was determined
to be related to several other Romanovs. Scientists have said the
accuracy of the identification is greater than 99 percent.
	   Q: Which are the two missing skeletons?
	   A: The body of Alexei, the hemophiliac heir to the throne, is
missing, as is one of his sisters, either Maria or Anastasia. One
American scientist using bone measurement techniques concluded that
the missing sister was Anastasia. But all other tests, including
facial reconstructions, have led investigators to conclude that the
missing skeleton is Maria. One of the coffins being buried Friday
is engraved with Anastasia's name.
	   Q: What about stories that Alexei or Anastasia escaped?
	   A: Hundreds of people have come forward over the years claiming
to be an escaped member of the royal family. None of the claims
have ever been proven, and claimants who have submitted to DNA
testing have been unrelated to the Romanovs. Perhaps the most
famous pretender, Anna Anderson, was determined by genetic testing
to be a Polish peasant named Franziska Schanzkowska.
	   Q: Why is the Russian Orthodox Church refusing to recognize the
bones as belonging to the czar and his family?
	   A: The debate is tied to larger battles within the church and
with Orthodox believers who have been living in exile since the
revolution. The exiled church has canonized the czar and has made
canonization by the Moscow patriarchate a precondition for
reunification _ which would significantly boost the church's
standing both within Russia and among other branches of Orthodoxy.
The Moscow-based church has started canonization proceedings, but
they are likely to take several more years. In the interim, if they
were to bury the czar without treating his remains as the holy
relics of a saint, the exiled church would take deep offense. Until
the Moscow patriarchate resolves the issue of canonization and
comes to an understanding on reunification with the exiled church,
it is unlikely to be able to move forward on identifying the bones.
	   Q: What will happen if the Russian Orthodox Church canonizes
Nicholas and the rest of the family?
	   A: According to Orthodox tradition, they will be exhumed,
ritually washed and dressed in sacred garments. After canonization
rites, they will be interred in special above-ground boxes known as
reliquaries, and their bones will be objects of veneration.

Top international official named Radio Television board
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The top international
official in Bosnia on Thursday appointed an interim board of
governors for the government's radio-television network.
	   The 11-member board of Radio-Television Bosnia and Herzegovina,
or RTVBiH, will oversee the restructing of the network and includes
prominent people from a range of professions and background.
	   ``The high representative sought to appoint a board without
political party officials that would reflect the country's ethnic
diversity,'' the Office of the Representative, Spanish diplomat
Carlos Westendorp, said in a statement.
	   Last month, two of the three members of the Bosnian joint
presidency offered a list of 11 nominees to Westendorp's office,
which approved nine and substituted two of their own candidates.
	   The third member of the presidency, Momcilo Krajisnik, a Bosnian
Serb and close ally of indicted war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic
refused to take part in the reorganization of the Sarajevo-based
network.
	   Although the Bosnian presidency has no legal authority over the
television, Westendorp's office consulted with them ``in the spirit
of cooperation and constructive engagement.''
	   Earlier this week, a spokesman for Westendorp, Simon
Haselock,said the appointment of the RTVBiH bard is an important
step forward in the process of rebuilding the country after the
1992-1995 war.
	   ``A financially secured public broadcast, which is not under any
direct political control, represents a foundation-stone of the
European-like democracy, and it is significant for the creation of
a pluralistic climate in Bosnia,'' Haselock said.
	   Since 1992, Bosnian Muslims, Serbs and Croats have operated
their own radio and television stations.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police for the first time
raided the headquarters of Kosovo's main Albanian political party
Thursday moments after members adjourned the first meeting of their
elected but unauthorized parliament.
	   No arrests were made during the half-hour operation, in which 20
heavily armed riot police and 10 plainclothed officers seized
documents in the drab headquarters building in the heart of the
provincial capital.
	   Police did not enter the building until after party leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, had taken his oath as president of the self-styled
Republic of Kosovo and the delegates were leaving.
	   There was no official explanation for the police action. The
government considers the Albanian parliament illegal, and the raid
could have been a warning not to continue to build such
institutions.
	   On the other hand, the fact that police waited until the meeting
was over suggested that the government was not seriously attempting
to muzzle Rugova, whom the United States and the Europeans see as
the Albanian leader most acceptable to head future peace talks with
the government.
	   A U.S. diplomat from Belgrade, Nicholas Hill, witnessed the raid
but U.S. officials had comment.

French striker signs long-term deal to stay at Arsenal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ French striker Nicolas Anelka has signed a
long-term contract to stay at Arsenal, just days after Gunners'
star forward Ian Wright transferred to West Ham.
	   Arsenal confirmed the deal Thursday but would not reveal the
length of Anelka's contract or the value of the deal.
	   Reports said Anelka, who narrowly missed a place in France's
World Cup squad, extended his contract from two to five years and
had his salary increased from about 15,000 pounds (dlrs 24,900) to
50,000 pounds (dlrs 83,000) a month.
	   Spanish clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona had reportedly made
offers for the 19-year-old star, who had complained he was not
being paid enough at Arsenal following his 500,000 pound (dlrs
830,000) move from Paris Saint Germain last year.
	   Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger said he was committed to keeping
Anelka at Arsenal after he emerged as a star of the future during
the Gunners FA Cup and League winning double campaign last season.
	   Anelka will team up front with Dutch star Dennis Bergkamp.

Arrested man linked to major cocaine seizure in Colombia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Anti-narcotics police have arrested the
cousin of a jailed drug kingpin and are probing his possible links
to the biggest cocaine seizure in Colombian history.
	   Pedro Nel ``Peter'' Herrera, cousin of imprisoned Cali cartel
leader Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera, was seized on Wednesday in Cali,
Colombia's third largest city, and charged with illegal enrichment,
money laundering and drug trafficking.
	   ``It's very possible that this individual was linked to the big
shipment of cocaine they tried to move out of Cartagena,'' said
police sub-director General Luis Ernesto Gilibert.
	   Police seized 7 tons of pure cocaine July 11 in the Caribbean
port city and valued the drugs at more than dlrs 100 million.
	   Gilibert said 32-year-old ``Peter'' Herrera was a key figure in
maintaining the Colombian cocaine trade through smaller, more
discrete organizations after police dismantled the Cali drug cartel
and began jailing its leaders in 1995.
	   One of the Cali traffickers was ``Pacho'' Herrera, who is
serving a six-year prison term in Colombia, and who the U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency says personally directed the organization's
cocaine distribution and money laundering in New York City during
the 1980s.

Military exercises begin off Baltic coast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) _ Thousnads of troops are taking part
in joint military maneuvers under NATO's Partnership for Peace that
got underway off Lithuania's coast.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius, in a speech
opening the Baltic Challenge '98 maneuvers, said ``these exercises
will only strengthen military trust in the region.''
	   But they also come amid tension between Russia and the three
former Soviet Baltic republics over their determination to join
NATO. Russia has offered security guarantees to Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia if they agree to stop seeking membership in the Western
alliance, but the offer has been rejected.
	   Russia, although a PFP member and with a huge naval base in the
Kaliningrad enclave just south of Lithuania, is not among the 11
countries participating in the exercises.
	   Besides the three Baltics, the countries involved ar the United
States, Poland, Germany, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and
Finland. A total of about 5,000 troops are in the exercise, some
2,000 of them American.
	   The exercises, which end on July 25, are meant to increased
preparedness for possible joint peacekeeping missions, organizers
said.
	   Among those taking part are five American-trained dolphins used
for locating underwater mines. It is the first time such dolphins
have been used in Europe.
	   At the opening ceremonies, U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Keith
Smith reiterated the American view that expanding NATO would be
good for all countries in the region.
	   ``One of the biggest difficulties is convincing people that
everybody can win with NATO (expansion),'' he said.
	   There was no direct link to the exercises and NATO membership
for the Baltics, but the maneuvers are likely to make the Baltics'
militaries more sophisticated, improving their chances for NATO
membership.
	   ``These exercises will help us greatly in reaching our goal of
getting into NATO,'' said Estonian government spokesman Daniel
Vaarik. ``Because, as NATO itself has said, it's not weapons we
need so much, but improving our communication and cooperation
skills.''

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Pilots of Lebanon's national airline
walked off their jobs Thursday, forcing the cancellation of 21
flights to and from Beirut International Airport.
	   The airline said the 24-hour strike cost the company dlrs 1.15
million, while the pilot's union said the action could have been
avoided had the airline agreed to pay an extra dlrs 20,000-30,000 a
month in higher salaries and benefits demanded by the strikers.
	   The state-owned Middle East Airlines operated only one flight,
to London, flown by two pilots who are administrative employees.
The Pilots' Union, which represents MEA's 160 pilots, suspended the
two pilots from the union.
	   MEA's 10 other departing flights and 11 incoming flights were
canceled because of the strike. An MEA pilot earns an average of
about dlrs 3,000 a month. The pilots are also demanding
compensation for extra work in previous years.
	   The strike began midnight Wednesday (2100 GMT) and will end
Thursday midnight.
	   MEA passengers were placed on some of the 15 other foreign
airlines flying into and out of Beirut. An Air France plane also
was chartered to ferry passengers from and to Paris later in the
day, officials said.
	   All the canceled flights to and from Beirut have been
rescheduled to resume at midnight (2100GMT) Thursday, the officials
said.
	   MEA, which employs about 5,000 people, is Lebanon's second
biggest employer after the public sector. It has a fleet of 15
aircraft and their destinations include South America and
Singapore.
	   MEA incurred dlrs 100 million losses in the last few years. The
government bought a 99 percent stake in the company after debts
owed to the Central Bank were converted into shares.

Death toll in German rail crash rises to 101
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ The death toll from last month's
high-speed train disaster in northern Germany reached 101 after a
victim died in the hospital, officials said Thursday.
	   The man, who had been hospitalized since the June 3 accident
near Eschede, died on Tuesday, according to state and hospital
officials. They declined to release further details.
	   Investigators believe a wheel on the InterCity Express broke,
causing the train to derail and smash into the support pillar of an
overpass at 200 kilometers (125 miles) an hour.
	   It was the worst accident in the history of the German railway.

Government forms committee to work on international oil consortium
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government formed a committee to
work on the creation of an international consortium that would
complete an oil pipeline and Black Sea oil terminal, a top industry
official said Thursday.
	   The consortium, to include international oil giants that
participate in the development of Caspian Sea deposits, is intended
to make the shipment of Azerbaijani oil to Europe through Ukraine
more attractive, said Valery Shuliko, deputy head of the State Oil
and Gas Committee.
	   The government committee is to work out terms of inviting
foreign companies to the consortium, and determine what stakes they
can hold in the venture. Shuliko said the government wants to
retain at least a 25 percent stake.
	   Ukraine, along with Russia, Turkey, Georgia and Iran, is eager
to transport Caspian Sea oil from huge Azerbaijani deposits to the
West.
	   The country has suggested that Caspian oil be taken by tankers
from the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa to the Black Sea port of
Odessa, where a big oil terminal is currently under construction.
	   From there, the oil will flow via a pipeline _ also under
construction _ to the western Ukrainian town of Brody for export.
	   Shuliko said Ukraine plans to ask a large international
consulting firm to help develop the structure and other details of
the project.
	   He said Ukraine can complete the terminal and pipeline on its
own, but participation of the oil companies developing Caspian
deposits would provide more guarantees that they eventually choose
the Ukrainian route.
	   Ukraine needs dlrs 200 million to complete the pipeline and dlrs
150 million to finish the terminal, Shuliko said.
	   The pipeline, which would transport 30 million tons of oil
annually, is already half-finished, but the terminal, with a
planned capacity of more than 50 million tons a year, is only 20
percent completed, he added.

New Montenegrin government voted into office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Opponents of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday voted a new reformist government
into office in Montenegro and pledged to secure equal footing for
their republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   The government of Premier Filip Vujanovic was elected with 47
votes in the 78-member parliament of Montenegro, which along with
Serbia forms all that remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Four deputies voted against the government, while those loyal to
Milosevic and his Montenegrin protege, Momir Bulatovic, boycotted
the session.
	   Milosevic, who became the Yugoslav president last year, wants to
fully dominate Montenegro but is opposed by the republic's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic.
	   Djukanovic's coalition won the election in Montenegro last May,
defeating Bulatovic. Milosevic and Djukanovic have clashes over
several economic and other issues.
	   On Wednesday, Djukanovic, who also enjoys U.S. support, accused
Milosevic of disregarding Montenegro's position in the Yugoslav
federation by appointing Bulatovic as the federal premier last May.
	   Djukanovic said he had met Milosevic recently, but the two could
not reach a compromise.
	   Vujanovic said ``the destiny of Montenegro and its citizens can
be decided only in Montenegro ... We cannot give up the Montenegrin
statehood, Montenegrin national identity, tradition and
culture...''
	   Vujanovic's government consists of representatives from several
opposition parties and an ethnic Albanian party in Montenegro. The
premier pledged further economic reforms in Montenegro.

Italian club urges media to lay off Brazilian star
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Ronaldo's Italian club urged the media on
Thursday to stop the flood of reports about the Brazilian
superstar's health.
	   In a statement faxed to news organizations, Inter Milan decried
the ``many and misleading indiscretions concerning the player's
state of health,'' which ``are of great damage to his person and
his image.''
	   Italy's three sports dailies have devoted full pages this week
to what is being called ``The Ronaldo Mystery,'' stemming from the
striker's fit of convulsions hours before Brazil lost 3-0 to France
in the World Cup final.
	   Brazil's team doctor said Monday that Ronaldo had suffered
stress-related convulsions before Sunday night's game.
	   Inter owner Massimo Moratti, who has granted Ronaldo a one-month
leave from the club, criticized Brazilian officials Tuesday for
``having Ronaldo play in those conditions.''
	   Ronaldo, 21, is expected to rejoin his Serie A team by
mid-August. League play opens Sept. 13.

Scots cheer as court tells French their drink isn't `whisky'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: Morison is cq

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ If the drink's not strong enough, you can't call
it whisky, and that's official.
	   Scotch Whisky distillers raised a triumphant glass Thursday
after the European Court of Justice ruled a French company was
improperly labeling its liquor ``Blended Whisky Spirit.''
	   The drink, called Gold River, is actually made up of several
types of whiskies _ including Canadian and American _ but it has
been diluted and contains just 30 percent alcohol. That's less than
the 40 percent that Scotch whisky makers require before labeling
their drink as such.
	   After finding Gold River being sold in Paris on the same shelf
as genuine Scotch whiskies, the lobbyists at the Scotch Whisky
Association sued in France. The case eventually was sent to the
European Court in Luxembourg.
	   The judges ruled Thursday afternoon that ``whisky'' has a clear
definition under European Union law.
	   ``The (European) Community regulation on the definition,
description and presentation of spirit drinks does not allow the
use of the term `whisky' in the name of a spirit drink containing
whisky diluted with water with an alcoholic strength of less than
40 percent,'' the ruling said.
	   Gold River is definitely a spirit, but not a whisky, so the word
``whisky'' can only appear in a list of ingredients, the court
said.
	   The Scotch Whisky Association said the ruling ``helps preserve
the integrity and quality which underpins Scotch Whisky brands.''
	   ``The decision against Gold River sets a valuable precedent,''
said Hugh Morison, director general for the whisky lobbyists.
``This brand can no longer be sold as whisky. Neither will six or
so similar under-strength drinks currently available in France. The
decision will halt the sale of all under-strength products as
whisky in, or their export from, the EU.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police for the first time
raided the headquarters of Kosovo's main Albanian political party
Thursday moments after members adjourned the first meeting of their
elected but unauthorized parliament.
	   No arrests were made during the half-hour operation, in which 20
heavily armed riot police and 10 plainclothed officers seized
documents in the drab headquarters building in the heart of the
provincial capital.
	   Police did not enter the building until after party leader,
Ibrahim Rugova, had taken his oath as president of the self-styled
Republic of Kosovo and the delegates were leaving.
	   In a statement, police said the raid ``prevented an attempt to
constitute the so-called `parliament of the Republic of Kosovo.'''
Police said the local prosecutor was considering filing charges.

American sets record after riding British roller coaster for four
</HEADLINE>
weeks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Richard Rodriguez has been riding a roller coaster
in Blackpool, England for four weeks, breaking his own world
record, and he's still going.
	   New York-born Rodriguez had endured the ups and downs of
Blackpool's Big Dipper for 600 hours when he achieved his new
record Wednesday and spends 22 hours daily on the roller coaster.
	   Blackpool Pleasure Beach, which hosted the competition, reported
that Rodriguez has held the record since 1994 when he rode the Big
Dipper for 549 hours.
	   Normand St. Pierre at La Rond Park in Quebec is challenging
Rodriguez for his title. St. Pierre is only two days behind the
champion, but Rodriguez has pledged to outlast his competitor.
	   ``He wants to break my record,'' Rodriguez said Wednesday night.
``We've been rivals for years, so I welcome the challenge. I'm
going to stay on for as long as it takes.''
	   Rodriguez follows the strict guidelines imposed by the
``Guinness Book of Records'' before it stopped tracking the roller
coaster competition several years ago. He eats, sleeps and drinks
in his favorite carriage in the middle of the wooden roller coaster
and takes off two hours each day to shower and eat a hot meal.
	   Rodriguez, who lectures in communications at Miami University in
Coral Gables, Fla., said he has trained extensively for the ride.
``This takes physical and mental stamina,'' he added.
	   Rodriguez said he passes the time by talking on his mobile
phone, listening to Nat King Cole, the Beatles and other '60s pop
tunes on his walkman and writing postcards.
	   ``When the World Cup was on I just wanted to get off with
everyone else and go and watch the game in the pub,'' he said.
``But I have to carry on.''
	   Rodriguez, a diabetic, is donating sponsorship funds to diabetes
research.
	   The Big Dipper, which is 75 years old this year, features five
drops and reaches up to 35 miles (56 km) per hour.
	   Rodriguez set his first roller coaster record on the Cyclone at
New York's Coney Island in 1977, after riding for 103 hours and 55
minutes.

	   Shell said Wednesday night it would not continue with the dlrs 3
billion project, the largest private investment in Peru's history,
because it wanted greater control over the sale and marketing of
the natural gas.
	   Shell was the operator in a partnership with Mobil Oil.
	   ``In spite of efforts by Shell and Mobil to overcome differences
with authorities over the introduction of gas into the Peruvian
market, a solution could not be found,'' said a brief news release
from Shell.
	   The three Camisea gas fields, located 350 miles (550 kms)
southeast of Lima amid some of the world's most biodiverse jungle,
are the largest gas reserves in the Americas, estimated to contain
more than 11 trillion (310 billion cubic meters) cubic feet of
natural gas and 600 million barrels of condensates.

 &UR; U.N. pulls human rights mission out of Rwanda
 &UR; Eds: AMs; UPDATES throughout with government statement; background;

 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The United Nations said Thursday it was
pulling its human rights mission out of Rwanda after it failed to
reach an agreement with the government on a new mandate.
	   The United Nations considers the monitoring of human rights
abuses to be a key part of the mandate of the mission established
as the first of its kind in November 1994, four months after half a
million people were killed in a government-orchestrated genocide.
	   But after four days of talks, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights and Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana said in
separate statements that in the absence of an agreement, the
mission will be terminated at the end of the month.
	   The government was unhappy with the way the mission was
concentrating on alleged reprisal killings by the army, rather than
focussing on attacks by Hutu rebels. And it said the mission was
not giving officials adequate time to respond to its reports.
	   The government also questioned the real value of the monitoring
process after the U.N. pulled its human rights observers out of the
western third of Rwanda following the deaths of five monitors in a
1997 rebel ambush near the southwestern border town of Cyangugu.
Most of the rebel attacks and army counterattacks occur in the
western part of the tiny central African nation.
	   ``The government of Rwanda is of the view that monitoring is not
a conditionality for technical cooperation,'' Gasana said in a
statement. ``It further reinstates its position that the task of
promoting respect for human rights and the rule of law is primarily
the responsibility of the government and people of Rwanda.''
	   In May, the government suspended the U.N. mission, which had a
staff of about 50, and insisted its mandate should be renegotiated
to focus on efforts to educate people about human rights and help
set up national rights organizations.
	   The United Nations, however, insisted that monitoring be part of
the operation.
	   ``In the field operation ... the United Nations must retain the
mandate and the means to monitor the human rights situation of the
country,'' the U.N. statement said.
	   The government has been sensitive to criticism of its human
rights record in the wake of the extremist Hutu
government-organized slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis
and politically moderate Hutus.
	   The present government took power in July 1994 after the victory
of Tutsi-led rebels who stopped the 90-day killing spree.
	   Many of the former Hutu government soldiers and militiamen
responsible for carrying out the genocide were among the 1 million
Hutu refugees fled into exile. They were also among the refugees
who returned to Rwanda in November 1996.
	   Since then, thousands of people _ both Hutus and Tutsis _ have
died in rebel attacks on schools, bars, buses and homes.
	   The government and the army say those soldiers suspected of
killing Hutu civilians are prosecuted. Army officials say it is
often impossible to distinguish between the rebels and ordinary
Hutu civilians, who provide the insurgents with shelter, food and
money.
	   The army has been working with the U.S. military and the
International Committee of the Red Cross to raise human rights
awareness among its troops.

LIMA, Peru: of condensates.

	   Shell estimated it would have started producing gas in 2001 and
brought Peru more than dlrs 8 billion over the next 10 years in tax
revenues, wages and investment. It was to have produced gas for 40
years.
	   President Alberto Fujimori had called the Camisea deal ``the
project of the century'' that would power Peru's economy in the
21st century, ending this impoverished Andean nation's dependence
on imported energy.
	   Large investments in fishing, cement and petrochemicals were
expected to pour into Peru on the back of Camisea.
	   Fujimori even traveled to England earlier this month to meet
with top Shell officials to try to sway their decision.
	   ``This is a major blow to Peru's economy. The anticipated income
from Camisea formed a part of how Peruvian authorities planned to
meet their foreign debt obligations,'' said oil and gas analyst
Daniel Saba.
	   Immediately after Shell's announcement, Finance Minister Jorge
Baca said the government would start accepting new bids to develop
Camisea shortly and vowed that it would be producing gas by 2003.
	   ``Clearly, the initial impact of Shell's decision is huge, but
Peru now will start looking for alternatives,'' said Manuel
Barrantes, former president of state oil company Petroperu.
	   Sensitive to its public relations disaster in Nigeria, where it
has been accused of destroying the environment and turning a blind
eye to the government's human rights abuses, Shell had planned to
make its Camisea operations a model of ecologically sensitive
drilling.
	   ``Shell in Camisea will set a new industry standard of
environmental responsibility,'' said Shell spokesman Andrew Vickers
before the pullout.
	   It had planned to use offshore drilling technology in the
jungle, creating isolated ``island'' camps where equipment and
personnel were flown in by helicopter.
	   No roads were to be built between camps or to the outside world
to prevent colonizers from flooding the remote region populated by
primitive Amazon tribes.
	   Workers were required to received 12 vaccines against common
diseases to protect the Indians from outside diseases and they were
not to be allowed to leave the camps.
	   All garbage and wastes were to have been flown to Lima.
	   Shell even promised to let a network of Peruvian environmental
and indigenous groups monitor operations, winning their grudging
support.
	   Shell and Mobil Oil signed a deal with Peru to develop Camisea
in 1996 with the option to pull out before 1998 if their evaluation
of fields' economic feasibility proved negative.
	   The 1998 deadline was largely seen as academic since they had
already spent dlrs 250 million drilling exploratory wells and
building camps.

Officials report malfunction at nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Operators at Bulgaria's only nuclear
power plant Thursday reported that a ``malfunction'' caused a
slight increase in radiation levels around the facility.
	   Higher gamma radiation levels were briefly registered during
standard technological operations around noon in and near the
reactor hall of Unit Two, which has been stopped for refuelling,
the Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy announced.
	   According to a press release by the government agency, radiation
levels briefly increased to 46 microroentgens an hour which is
twice the natural radiation level.
	   Unit Two is undergoing repairs and there has been no breach of
radiation protection norms, the press release says.
	   The failure occurred in one of the four 440-megawatt units of
the plant.
	   The Kozlodui plant, located 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of
Sofia, has four 440-megawatt pressurized water units, without
safety encasement that were brought in line between 1974 and 1982.
	   Two newer 1,000-megawatt units with encasement were installed in
1987 and 1989.
	   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has long
described the four older units as a safety risk.
	   Bulgaria has invested over dlrs 100 million to upgrade the
reactors' safety systems and repeatedly balked at calls from the
West to close them down.
	   The plant provides some 40 percent of the country's electricity.

	   PODGORICA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Opponents of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday voted a new reformist government
into office in Montenegro and pledged to secure equal footing for
their republic in the Yugoslav federation.
	   The government of Premier Filip Vujanovic was elected with 47
votes in the 78-member parliament of Montenegro, which along with
Serbia forms all that remains of Yugoslavia.
	   Four deputies voted against the government, while those loyal to
Milosevic and his Montenegrin protege, Momir Bulatovic, boycotted
the session.
	   Milosevic, who became the Yugoslav president last year, wants to
fully dominate Montenegro but is opposed by the republic's
pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic.
	   Djukanovic's coalition won the election in Montenegro last May,
defeating Bulatovic. Milosevic and Djukanovic have clashes over
several economic and other issues.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Anglo-Dutch oil giant Shell has said it will
pull out of the massive Camisea gas fields project in the Amazon
rain forest, rocking one of the pillars of Peru's planned economic
development.
	   Shell said Wednesday night it would not continue with the dlrs 3
billion project, the largest natural resource investment in Peru's
history, because it wanted greater control over the sale and
marketing of the natural gas.
	   Shell was the operator in a partnership with Mobil Oil.
	   ``In spite of efforts by Shell and Mobil to overcome differences
with authorities over the introduction of gas into the Peruvian
market, a solution could not be found,'' said a brief news release
from Shell. It did not give further reasons for the pull out.
	   The three Camisea gas fields, located 350 miles (550 kms)
southeast of Lima amid some of the world's most biodiverse jungle,
are the largest gas reserves in the Americas, estimated to contain
more than 11 trillion (310 billion cubic meters) cubic feet of
natural gas and 600 million barrels of condensates.
	   Shell estimated it would have started producing gas in 2001 and
brought Peru more than dlrs 8 billion over the next 10 years in tax
revenues, wages and investment. It was to have produced gas for 40
years.
	   President Alberto Fujimori had called the Camisea deal ``the
project of the century'' that would power Peru's economy in the
21st century, ending this impoverished Andean nation's dependence
on imported energy.
	   Large investments in fishing, cement and petrochemicals were
expected to pour into Peru on the back of Camisea.
	   Fujimori even traveled to England earlier this month to meet
with top Shell officials to try to sway their decision.
	   ``This is a major blow to Peru's economy. The anticipated income
from Camisea formed a part of how Peruvian authorities planned to
meet their foreign debt obligations,'' said oil and gas analyst
Daniel Saba.
	   Immediately after Shell's announcement, Finance Minister Jorge
Baca said the government would start accepting new bids to develop
Camisea shortly and vowed that it would be producing gas by 2003.
	   ``Clearly, the initial impact of Shell's decision is huge, but
Peru now will start looking for alternatives,'' said Manuel
Barrantes, former president of state oil company Petroperu.
	   Sensitive to its public relations disaster in Nigeria, where it
has been accused of destroying the environment and turning a blind
eye to the government's human rights abuses, Shell had planned to
make its Camisea operations a model of ecologically sensitive
drilling.
	   ``Shell in Camisea will set a new industry standard of
environmental responsibility,'' said Shell spokesman Andrew Vickers
before the pullout.
	   It had planned to use offshore drilling technology in the
jungle, creating isolated ``island'' camps where equipment and
personnel were flown in by helicopter.
	   No roads were to be built between camps or to the outside world
to prevent colonizers from flooding the remote region populated by
primitive Amazon tribes.
	   Workers were required to received 12 vaccines against common
diseases to protect the Indians from outside diseases and they were
not to be allowed to leave the camps.
	   All garbage and wastes were to have been flown to Lima.
	   Shell even promised to let a network of Peruvian environmental
and indigenous groups monitor operations, winning their grudging
support.
	   Shell and Mobil Oil signed a deal with Peru to develop Camisea
in 1996 with the option to pull out before 1998 if their evaluation
of fields' economic feasibility proved negative. They spent dlrs
250 million drilling exploratory wells and building camps before
signing the deal.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Richard Rodriguez has been riding a roller coaster
in Blackpool, England for four weeks, breaking his own world
record, and he's still going.
	   New York-born Rodriguez had endured the ups and downs of
Blackpool's Big Dipper for 600 hours when he achieved his new
record Wednesday and spends 22 hours daily on the roller coaster.
	   Blackpool Pleasure Beach, which hosted the competition, reported
that Rodriguez has held the record since 1994 when he rode the Big
Dipper for 549 hours.
	   Normand St. Pierre at La Ronde Park in Montreal, Quebec is
challenging Rodriguez for his title. St. Pierre is only two days
behind the champion, but Rodriguez has pledged to outlast his
competitor.
	   ``He wants to break my record,'' Rodriguez said Wednesday night.
``We've been rivals for years, so I welcome the challenge. I'm
going to stay on for as long as it takes.''
	   Rodriguez follows the strict guidelines imposed by the
``Guinness Book of Records'' before it stopped tracking the roller
coaster competition several years ago. He eats, sleeps and drinks
in his favorite carriage in the middle of the wooden roller coaster
and takes off two hours each day to shower and eat a hot meal.
	   Rodriguez, who lectures in communications at Miami University in
Coral Gables, Fla., said he has trained extensively for the ride.
``This takes physical and mental stamina,'' he added.
	   Rodriguez said he passes the time by talking on his mobile
phone, listening to Nat King Cole, the Beatles and other '60s pop
tunes on his walkman and writing postcards.
	   ``When the World Cup was on I just wanted to get off with
everyone else and go and watch the game in the pub,'' he said.
``But I have to carry on.''
	   Rodriguez, a diabetic, is donating sponsorship funds to diabetes
research.
	   The Big Dipper, which is 75 years old this year, features five
drops and reaches up to 35 miles (56 km) per hour.
	   Rodriguez set his first roller coaster record on the Cyclone at
New York's Coney Island in 1977, after riding for 103 hours and 55
minutes.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police are investigating what is
believed to be the Dutch arm of an international child pornography
ring that has sexually abused children as young as 12 months and
spread digital images of the abuse on the Internet.
	   Dutch police confirmed Thursday they are investigating a child
pornography ring but would give no further details, saying that
their investigation was not yet completed.
	   Respected Dutch current affairs program NOVA said Wednesday it
had been handed computer disks containing thousands of ``very
shocking'' photographs of children being abused. One Dutch child
psychologist told NOVA the material was the worst he had ever seen.
	   ``The people who did this must feel the full force of the law,''
Germany's minister for family and youth, Claudia Nolte, said in
Bonn.
	   She said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has increased
penalties against the distribution of pornographic images.
	   ``The Internet is not a lawless space,'' she said.
	   Berlin police said they had not been officially notified about
the raid and so could not comment.
	   A Belgian group called Morkhoven which fights child pornography
reportedly discovered the disks in an apartment in the Dutch
coastal town of Zandvoort as they tried to trace a missing German
child believed to have been abducted and abused for child
pornography, according to the German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost.
	   The child, Manuel Schadwald, disappeared aged 12 years in 1993
and was later reportedly seen in bordellos in Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, Berliner Morgenpost reported.
	   The owner of the Zandvoort apartment, a German identified as G.
Ulrich, was recently murdered in Italy by a fellow gang member,
apparently because he had tipped off police about the ring's
activities, Dutch media reported Thursday.
	   No arrests have been made in connection with the Dutch
investigation, police spokesman Jaap Hage said. Police scheduled a
press conference for Thursday evening to give more details on the
case.

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Tiger Woods took advantage of his
length and hot putter today to shoot a 5-under 65 and tie John
Huston for the early lead in the British Open.
	   Woods, looking to contend in a major for the first time since
winning the Masters, nearly drove the 411-yard (375-meter) ninth
hole and reached the only two par-5s on the course with irons on
his second shot. But the putter, which has betrayed him in recent
major championships, may have been the key on a warm and nearly
windless day at Royal Birkdale.
	   Woods would have had the early lead to himself, but his 5-foot
(1 1/2-meter) par putt on the final hole hit the left lip and
kicked out. It was a rare mistake on a day he made seven birdies
against two bogeys.
	   The score was a stroke off the 64 Woods shot last year at Royal
Troon. But that came in the third round after he had basically shot
himself out of contention and he finished in a tie for 24th.
	   ``This was very similar to the third round at Troon, but this
time I putted better,'' Woods said. ``I made a couple of bombs
which felt really good.''
	   Woods, who made four birdie putts within 12 feet (3 1/2 meters)
on the front side, sank a curling 35-footer (10 1/2-meter) on the
13th hole to offset a bogey a hole earlier. He then birdied the
par-5 15th and 17th holes before closing with the bogey 5.
	   Withn half the field still out on a course that played much
simpler than expected because of the fair weather, Woods and Huston
were a shot better than 1994 Open winner Nick Price in the opening
round.
	   Another shot back at 67 were Brad Faxon and Sweden's Fredrik
Jacobson, while 10 other golfers also finished under par midway
through the first day.
	   The weather was in stark contrast to conditions in practice this
week when the wind howled and players grumbled that no one would
break par for the championship. And it was enjoyed with a close eye
kept on the forecast for increased winds and rain on Friday.
	   ``As the sun broke through, it was almost perfect,'' Woods said.
``We might even get some people with heat stroke out here.''
	   Woods played nearly perfect golf on the front side, taking
advantage of light winds and soft greens that tamed the links on
the Irish Sea. He moved into the lead with a 3-foot (1-meter)
birdie after chipping to the ninth green, and had three more
birdies on the back nine.
	   At the par-3 12th, Woods misclubbed and hit the ball over the
green. He chipped to within 2-feet (1 1/2 meter), but lipped out
his par putt.
	   Woods, whose putter kept him from contending in the U.S. Open
and the Masters this year, hasn't won a major since the 1997
Masters and has won only once on the PGA Tour this year, in the
BellSouth Classic.
	   But he insisted coming into the Open that he was striking the
ball well, and he showed it with some long drives and precise irons
before a massive gallery that cheered every shot.
	   Jacobson, playing in the first group of the day, used an eagle
on the par-5 17th to take the early clubhouse lead.
	   It didn't last long, though, as Huston made a 40-footer
(12-meter) for eagle on the 17th hole, then hit a spectacular shot
out of the deep rough on the final hole that hopped up on the green
and rolled to within 3 feet (1 meter) of the hole for a finishing
birdie and a 5-under 65.
	   Huston, who had to use a special career money winning exemption
to play on the PGA tour this year, credited magnets in his bed and
in the insole of his shoes for helping relieve tendinitis and
bursitis and allow him to play nearly pain-free again.
	   ``Last year, pretty much every day I would get up and wouldn't
feel very strong, kind of achey,'' Huston said. ``I didn't look
forward to going to the golf course, and it showed.''
	   While Huston was having his best day in five Opens, it was Woods
who thrilled the crowd on a day when overcast skies and little wind
helped the field throw high iron shots at the pins without fear of
the tall meadow rye rough.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, meanwhile, teased his fans with
two early birdies but may have shot himself out of yet another Open
in the first round with a 40 on the back for a 3-over 73.
	   England's Lee Westwood, who along with David Duval had been one
of the young favorites, also got off to a shaky start with two
bogeys on the front nine. Westwood had to birdie the 16th and 17th
to finish at 1-over 71, while Duval bogeyed the first hole and was
1-over at the turn.
	   Neither Duval nor Westwood has won a major, but both have been
dominant players in the last year. Westwood in particular is on a
roll, having won seven times on four continents in the last nine
months, including three of his last four tournaments.
	   ``As soon as the putts start going in I think I will be making a
move in the right direction,'' Westwood said.
	   Woods, of course, already has his win in a major. And he also
has the length to contend at the 7,018-yard (6,414-meter) Birkdale,
where the winds can play havoc with scores. He not only hits it
long, but has the power to rip the ball out of the deep meadow rye
that has encroached even further on the fairways than the last time
the Open was here in 1991.
	   ``I think I have a chance in each and every major,'' Woods said
earlier. ``You've got to be hitting on all cylinders in order to
win. Every facet of your game has to be good in order to win a
major.''
	   Tom Lehman, who won in 1996, had a late tee time but still
played despite injuring his right shoulder at a local amusement
park on Tuesday. Lehman was even par through nine holes.
	   Fred Couples birdied the first hole of his round and was 2-under
after 11, while Davis Love III was also at 3-under after 16 holes.
	   No matter who contends this week, though, the eighth Open held
in this town on the Irish Sea will mark the passing of an era.
	   Jack Nicklaus made sure of that when he announced earlier this
month that he would skip Birkdale, ending his remarkable streak of
major tournaments at 146.

Assad's rare visit could set stage for new peace dynamic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Assad at Elysee Palace for talks; ADDS new 7th
graf to show French historic ties to Mideast &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad arrived in France
Thursday for the first time in 22 years, a rare Western visit that
could mean a higher profile for Europe in the Middle East peace
process, and for Syria on the world stage.
	   Assad's visit aims to pull Syria out of its diplomatic and
economic isolation. It comes two months after Damascus began
negotiations for a so-called association accord with the European
Union, aimed at improved trade and other ties.
	   President Jacques Chirac met Assad on his arrival Thursday
afternoon at Orly airport, where the two leaders marched down a red
carpet to martial music. Assad received a second red carpet
greeting upon his arrival two hours later for the first of two sets
of talks with Chirac.
	   The Republican Guard, in shiny helmets garnished with horse
tails, were lined up in the Elysee Palace courtyard to welcome
Assad and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Chareh, who was meeting with
his French counterpart, Hubert Vedrine.
	   The French Foreign Ministry this week said economic relations
are not up to par with the level of political ties. A boost in
bilateral ties is a sure outcome of the visit.
	   Less certain is the outcome of talks on the Middle East peace
process. Chirac, who visited Syria in 1996, has long sought a role
for Europe, and France in particular, in the process mediated
primarily by the United States.
	   France has particular leverage in the Middle East today because
of its past presence there. Syria, for instance, was a
French-mandated territory from 1920-46.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux said Monday all
aspects of the peace process, including Syria and Lebanon, would be
addressed. He underscored France's belief that only a global accord
can bring peace.
	   In an interview aired Wednesday on France's TF1 television
station, Assad said Syria is demanding Israel hand over the Golan
Heights, seized in 1967, in exchange for peace, in keeping with the
land-for-peace-based talks that are the basis of the peace process.
	   ``Netanyahu says he wants peace for peace, a motto which means
that he wants to retain our land and also take peace from us,''
Assad said.
	   Asked if Syria would withdraw from Lebanon if Israel gave up the
Golan Heights, Assad replied: ``I don't see the link between the
two.'' Syria maintains about 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the
main power broker in the country.
	   A French-Egyptian proposal for an international conference to
save the peace process made in May will be discussed.
	   The visit by Assad, who runs Syria with a tight fist and is
accused by the United States of sponsoring terrorism, has stirred
passions that surpass politics.
	   A nagging issue between Paris and Damascus has been the alleged
presence in Syria of Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner and Syria's
refusal to respond to French requests to make a judicial inquiry.
	   In the interview, Assad denied knowledge that Brunner, 87, is in
Syria.
	   ``If you know where he is, go immediately to his address to find
out whether or not he is there,'' Assad said.
	   Brunner is blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece. Nazi trackers place Brunner in Syria
under the alias of Georg Fischer.
	   Brunner was placed under formal investigation by France in 1988
for crimes against humanity.

<TEXT>
	   LORENZAGO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II was ``deeply
saddened'' by the deaths of three young brothers in a firebomb
attack in Northern Ireland and is worried about the consequences
for the peace process, his spokesman said Thursday.
	   The pope watched some film of the funeral on television, said
spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls from this Alpine town where John
Paul is vacationing.
	   He expressed ``his sadness over the tragic deaths of the
youngsters and his (concern) for the possible repercussions on the
peace process,'' Navarro-Valls said.
	   Police have announced several arrests in the arson attack
Sunday. The boys' mother was Catholic, but they were raised as
Protestants.

Enron Corp. buys Elektro for dlrs1.27 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ U.S. power company Enron Corp. bought a
controlling stake in Sao Paulo state electric utility Elektro
Eletricidade e Servicos Thursday for 1.48 billion reals (dlrs 1.27
billion), nearly twice the government's minimum asking price.
	   The government was asking 743.6 million reals (dlrs 641 million)
in a closed-envelope auction for the electric utility, known in
Brazil as Elektro.
	   The next highest offer came from Electricidade de Portugal, with
a bid 63 percent above the minimum price. Brazilian utilities CPFL
and Escelsa and GPU Inc. of the U.S. also submitted bids.
	   Enron's offer is the highest premium paid to date in an electric
utility privatization in Brazil. The market had expected a premium
of between 20 percent and 40 percent.
	   Elektro, the wholly owned distribution subsidiary of Cia
Energetica de Sao Paulo (CESP), was originally supposed to go on
the auction block in March, but the process was halted by
complaints that the sales model threatened interests of minority
shareholders.
	   CESP President Guilherme Cirne de Toledo said he was expecting a
premium of between 50 percent and 60 percent of the government's
minimum asking price.
	   ``This confirms our belief that Elektro is without doubt the
best distributor in Brazil,'' he said.
	   Cirne de Toledo said the earnings would be used to reduce CESP
debt, which stands at 9 billion reals (dlrs 7.75 billion).
	   Before the auction, state officials said they weren't counting
on a premium and were hoping simply for a high level of bidding
interest.
	   Afterwards, Mauro Arce, deputy secretary of energy for the state
government, said the successful Elektro auction ``means the
sector's privatization process is back on track.''
	   In April, the government's program suffered a severe blow when
it sold only one of the two distribution units of another power
company, Eletropaulo, and only at the minimum bid price.
	   The Houston-based Enron started as a gas pipeline company and
turned into the top power marketing group in the U.S.. In Brazil,
it also started in gas and has made its first investment in
electricity assets with the Elektro purchase, its largest
acquisition in the country so far.
	   The company has already invested dlrs 700 million in Brazil in
eight gas distribution companies in Brazil, including Rio de
Janeiro's utility Riogas, and participates in the Brazil-Bolivia
gas pipeline now under construction.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Pilots of Lebanon's national airline
walked off their jobs Thursday, forcing the cancellation of 21
flights to and from Beirut International Airport.
	   The airline said the 24-hour strike cost the company dlrs 1.15
million, while the pilot's union said the action could have been
avoided had the airline agreed to pay an extra dlrs 20,000-30,000 a
month in higher salaries and benefits demanded by the strikers.
	   The state-owned Middle East Airlines operated only one flight,
to London, flown by two pilots who are administrative employees.
The Pilots' Union, which represents MEA's 160 pilots, suspended the
two pilots from the union.
	   MEA's 10 other departing flights and 11 incoming flights were
canceled because of the strike. An MEA pilot earns an average of
about dlrs 3,000 a month. The pilots are also demanding
compensation for extra work in previous years.
	   The strike began midnight Wednesday (2100 GMT) and will end
Thursday midnight.
	   MEA passengers were placed on some of the 15 other foreign
airlines flying into and out of Beirut. An Air France plane also
was chartered to ferry passengers from and to Paris later in the
day, officials said.
	   All the canceled flights to and from Beirut have been
rescheduled to resume at midnight (2100GMT) Thursday, the officials
said.
	   MEA, which employs about 5,000 people, is Lebanon's second
biggest employer after the public sector. It has a fleet of 15
aircraft and their destinations include South America and
Singapore.
	   MEA incurred dlrs 100 million losses in the last few years. The
government bought a 99 percent stake in the company after debts
owed to the Central Bank were converted into shares.

A grateful nation begins its long goodbye

<TEXT>
	   KRUGER PARK, South Africa (AP) _ A grateful nation began its
long goodbye Thursday, opening celebrations of President Nelson
Mandela's 80th birthday with a giant cake and the gleeful songs of
children.
	   Mandela will step down next year and his birthday Saturday is
the focal point of festivities aimed at saying thanks to the man
whose courage and integrity brought about a peaceful transition
from apartheid and pointed the country toward racial
reconciliation.
	   After elections next year, Mandela most likely will be replaced
by his deputy Thabo Mbeki, a fact that worries many whites, mindful
of a growing feeling among poor blacks that not enough has been
done to redistribute wealth.
	   But under clear blue African skies such political worries seemed
far away as Mandela hosted a birthday party for about 1,400 foster
children of all races at a camp site in Kruger Park game reserve.
	   Mandela made no mention of newspaper reports saying he plans to
marry his long-time companion Graca Machel, the widow of Mozambican
President Samora Machel, this weekend. But his daughter Zinzi
Mandela said it would not happen soon.
	   ``We are all hoping it is going to happen one day, but it's not
going to be now,'' she told reporters.
	   In the heart of the park hundreds of children played games and
ate snacks from stalls. They cheered and sang happy birthday as
Mandela, wearing a trademark blue African patterned short, walked
through the crowds, smiling and accepting cards and gifts.
	   Famed for his love of children, Mandela beamed as three young
girls sang him a specially written song called ``You're Special.''
	   Belying his age, Mandela danced enthusiastically along to the
tune before slicing a cake with a young childrens' television
presenter, Katinka Nienaber, who turns 14 on Saturday, the same
date as Mandela's birthday.
	   Mandela has won wide support from all races for advocating
racial forgiveness. At the same time he has constantly pushed those
who benefitted from apartheid to do more to help those
disadvantaged by it.
	   ``In a country rich with heroes, Madiba has stood out as a
symbol and a living manifestation of that which the human spirit is
capable of,'' his ruling African National Congress party said in a
congratulatory message, using his clan name ``Madiba'' as a sign of
respect.
	   Some members of his party, particularly those alligned to its
labor and communist allies, have criticized the ANC for being soft
on whites, many of whom still live luxurious lifestyles.
	   However, breaking from a prepared speech on the importance of
youth and the family, Mandela told a lunch gathering that whites
had done much to heal the country's racial wounds.
	   He particulary singled out white-owned businesses for their
efforts to empower the black majority.
	   ``Business in this country now wants to share their fortune with
the least developed people in this country,'' he said.
	   Mandela insisted that whites had an important role to play in
developing South Africa, using the skills that their privileged
upbringing under apartheid gave them to uplift their fellow
citizens.
	   ``You can take part in shaping the future of this country,'' he
said ``Blacks regard you as their important partners.''
	   For the 27 years he was imprisoned, Mandela was demonized by the
country's white apartheid rulers. But the man whites had been
taught to fear became, through his dignity and sincerity, the most
adored man in the country.
	   Tony Leon, the leader of the small white liberal Democratic
Party, in his birthday message called Mandela a powerful symbol of
courage, hope and reconciliation to South Africans and the world.
	   He said Mandela's pivotal role in bringing about a peaceful
transition to democracy was a towering achievement ``which will
ensure his place among the pantheon of truly great world leaders of
the 20th Century.''
	   The lunch in the park was attended by celebrities and business
guests, including British supermodel Naomi Campbell.
	   ``I hope that he will live forever and ever and have many happy
birthdays,'' said Campbell, who earlier this year organized a
fashion show to raise funds for Mandela's own childrens' charity.
	   The Kruger Park party is just the first official celebration of
Mandela's birthday. On Saturday he hosts a small, private party at
his house in the plush Johannesburg suburb of Houghton.
	   An enormous banquet will then follow on Sunday night at a venue
near Johannesburg, which will be attended by an estimated 2,000
people. Tickets for the bash have been sold for 8,000 rand each
(dlrs 1,330).
	   In additions to the formal celebrations many ordinary South
Africans are holding parties in their homes or at some of the bars
and nightclubs that are having special Mandela-themed evenings.

	   KENT, England (AP) _ Prince Charles succeeded Thursday where
England's David Batty failed during the World Cup _ he converted a
penalty kick.
	   The Prince of Wales was visiting the Guru Nanak Sikh soccer club
when he was invited to take a penalty against Charlton Athletic
goalkeeper Sasa Ilic.
	   The Macedonian-born 'keeper was hailed as a hero last season
when he saved a penalty in Charlton's shootout win over Sunderland,
a victory which propelled the club into the Premier League.
	   Standing nervously before the shot, the prince said, ``I will
never get the ball past him.''
	   But he firmly drove the past past Ilic into the back of the net,
drawing cheers from the young players.
	   ``I didn't even see it,'' a smiling Ilic told the prince.
	   The prince, at the request of photographers, took another kick _
but this time, Ilic saved it.
	   Charles was visiting the youth club along with several Charlton
players involved in the Let's Kick Racism Out of Football campaign.
	   The prince, who attended England's World Cup game with Colombia
on June 26 with his son, Prince Harry, also played a kickabout game
with some of the youngsters.
	   ``I asked him if he would kick the ball to me,'' 12-year-old
Scott Bhans said. ``He said he hadn't played football in a very
long time but I thought he was quite good. He was really good at
the penalty kicks.''

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police are investigating what is
believed to be the Dutch arm of an international child pornography
ring that has sexually abused children as young as 12 months and
spread digital images of the abuse on the Internet.
	   Dutch police confirmed Thursday they are investigating a child
pornography ring but would give no further details, saying that
their investigation was not yet completed.
	   Respected Dutch current affairs program NOVA said Wednesday it
had been handed computer disks containing thousands of ``very
shocking'' photographs of children being abused. One Dutch child
psychologist told NOVA the material was the worst he had ever seen.
	   ``The people who did this must feel the full force of the law,''
Germany's minister for family and youth, Claudia Nolte, said in
Bonn.
	   She said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has increased
penalties against the distribution of pornographic images.
	   ``The Internet is not a lawless space,'' she said.
	   Berlin police said they had not been officially notified about
the raid and so could not comment.
	   A Belgian group called Morkhoven which fights child pornography
reportedly discovered the disks in an apartment in the Dutch
coastal town of Zandvoort as they tried to trace a missing German
child believed to have been abducted and abused for child
pornography, according to the German newspaper Berliner Morgenpost.
	   The child, Manuel Schadwald, disappeared aged 12 years in 1993
and was later reportedly seen in bordellos in Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, Berliner Morgenpost reported.
	   The owner of the Zandvoort apartment, a German identified as G.
Ulrich, was recently murdered in Italy by a fellow gang member,
apparently because he had tipped off police about the ring's
activities, Dutch media reported Thursday.
	   No arrests have been made in connection with the Dutch
investigation, police spokesman Jaap Hage said. Police scheduled a
press conference for Thursday evening to give more details on the
case.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Eight decades after he was forced
to give up his home, his throne and eventually his life, Russia's
last czar returned to the imperial capital Thursday to receive the
honor and dignity previously denied him in death.
	   Nicholas II, the last ``Emperor of All the Russias,'' was
greeted by the salutes of military cadets and the solemn tributes
of thousands of Russians who stood along sidewalks to watch his
cortege travel slowly to the cathedral where he will be buried
Friday.
	   ``We're watching history, the history of Russia,'' said
Alexandra Butina, 16, who brought her 9-year-old brother Semyon to
watch the line of hearses slowly drive through the gates of the
city's central fortress.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution, the
Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and repentance.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who previously tried to stay out of the
fray, abruptly changed his mind Thursday and announced that he
would attend Friday's requiem and burial ceremony.
	   ``The truth was concealed for 80 years,'' Yeltsin said.
``Nothing was said about it. And tomorrow, the truth should be
told, and I should take part.''
	   Lyuba Novikova, a 37-year-old secretary, said she was surprised
by the depth of emotion she felt when she saw the hearses appear
over the arch of the Troitsky Bridge.
	   ``I cried,'' she said. ``I'm a simple person. I can't say why,
but I cried.''
	   But then she gave it another thought and added: ``It's like a
shadow has been over us, and now we hope things will be better for
Russia.''
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for 300 years. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
his wife, Alexandra, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nine of the 11 bodies
were recovered from a desolate forest outside the Ural Mountains
city of Yekaterinburg and subjected to years of painstaking tests
to confirm their identification.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, when the
bones were taken from the city's police morgue and placed in small,
skeleton-sized coffins. On Thursday morning, they were taken to a
hilltop church for a three-hour public service.
	   Hundreds of Russians knelt to pray, and some wept, as they
viewed coffins at the Ascension of the Lord Church.
	   ``I have come to pay a last tribute to the innocent victims,''
said a tearful Vera Kolchina, 74. ``Their deaths were a tragic part
of our history.''
	   The coffins were then loaded into plain white vans and driven to
the Yekaterinburg airport. They were flown to St. Petersburg aboard
an Aeroflot cargo jet, met by an honor guard and borne to the
cortege for the procession through the stately streets of the old
capital.
	   The procession moved briskly until it reached the Winter Palace,
the czar's official residence. It then slowed to a regal gait, as
if to give the royal family one last glimpse of home.
	   The events will culminate in Friday's requiem, which will be
recited in Orthodox churches throughout the country.
	   But the actual burial ceremony in St. Petersburg's Peter and
Paul Cathedral will be relatively simple. The church, torn by
internal conflicts, has not yet recognized the bones as belonging
to the royal family. And so when they are interred, the priest will
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
are already hanging on the walls of the chapel.
	   ``I don't think the church is right,'' said Yuri Basiliyev, a
30-year-old history student. ``Their decision is a political
action. ... They don't want to give this government their
legitimacy.''

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Royal Dutch-Shell has said it will pull out of
the massive Camisea gas fields project in the Amazon rain forest,
rocking one of the pillars of Peru's planned economic development.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant said Wednesday night it would not
continue with the dlrs 3 billion project, the largest natural
resource investment in Peru's history, because it wanted greater
control over the sale and marketing of the natural gas.
	   Shell was the operator in a partnership with Mobil Oil.
	   ``In spite of efforts by Shell and Mobil to overcome differences
with authorities over the introduction of gas into the Peruvian
market, a solution could not be found,'' said a brief news release
from Shell. It did not give further reasons for the pull out.
	   The three Camisea gas fields, located 350 miles (550 kms)
southeast of Lima amid some of the world's most biodiverse jungle,
are the largest gas reserves in the Americas, estimated to contain
more than 11 trillion (310 billion cubic meters) cubic feet of
natural gas and 600 million barrels of condensates.
	   Shell estimated it would have started producing gas in 2001 and
brought Peru more than dlrs 8 billion over the next 10 years in tax
revenues, wages and investment. It was to have produced gas for 40
years.
	   President Alberto Fujimori had called the Camisea deal ``the
project of the century'' that would power Peru's economy in the
21st century, ending this impoverished Andean nation's dependence
on imported energy.
	   Large investments in fishing, cement and petrochemicals were
expected to pour into Peru on the back of Camisea.
	   Fujimori even traveled to England earlier this month to meet
with top Shell officials to try to sway their decision.
	   ``This is a major blow to Peru's economy. The anticipated income
from Camisea formed a part of how Peruvian authorities planned to
meet their foreign debt obligations,'' said oil and gas analyst
Daniel Saba.
	   Immediately after Shell's announcement, Finance Minister Jorge
Baca said the government would start accepting new bids to develop
Camisea shortly and vowed that it would be producing gas by 2003.
	   ``Clearly, the initial impact of Shell's decision is huge, but
Peru now will start looking for alternatives,'' said Manuel
Barrantes, former president of state oil company Petroperu.
	   Sensitive to its public relations disaster in Nigeria, where it
has been accused of destroying the environment and turning a blind
eye to the government's human rights abuses, Shell had planned to
make its Camisea operations a model of ecologically sensitive
drilling.
	   ``Shell in Camisea will set a new industry standard of
environmental responsibility,'' said Shell spokesman Andrew Vickers
before the pullout.
	   It had planned to use offshore drilling technology in the
jungle, creating isolated ``island'' camps where equipment and
personnel were flown in by helicopter.
	   No roads were to be built between camps or to the outside world
to prevent colonizers from flooding the remote region populated by
primitive Amazon tribes.
	   Workers were required to received 12 vaccines against common
diseases to protect the Indians from outside diseases and they were
not to be allowed to leave the camps.
	   All garbage and wastes were to have been flown to Lima.
	   Shell even promised to let a network of Peruvian environmental
and indigenous groups monitor operations, winning their grudging
support.
	   Shell and Mobil Oil signed a deal with Peru to develop Camisea
in 1996 with the option to pull out before 1998 if their evaluation
of fields' economic feasibility proved negative. They spent dlrs
250 million drilling exploratory wells and building camps before
signing the deal.

	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ In technology-crazy Finland, even the
bugs are bugged.
	   In an experiment in Kerava, a town near Helsinki, scientists
have strapped tiny tranmsitters to beetles to monitor their
movements in a disused field.
	   The scientists tune in to the transmitters, which weigh less
than a half-gram (0.0175 ounces), each morning to see where the
beetles are. By monitoring their movements, ``We want to see how
the beetles move to find clues on ways to improve urban
environments for all living things, including humans,'' Jari
Niemela, from the University of Helsinki, said Thursday.
	   The results of the 10-day experiment will be published as part
of a larger ecological project charting plants, insects and nature
in Kerava, a town of 30,000.
	   Finns are famously enthusiastic about electronics, and have the
world's highest percentage of cellular phone users _ 42 of every
100 people in the country carry one, according to the World Bank.
	   It's unlikely beetles would be quite so enthusiastic _ the
transmitters used in the experiment are about half the weight of
the insects themselves.
	   But Niemela said that earlier experiments indicated their
movements were not hampered in any significant way.
	   Since the project began on July 10, Niemela's team has lost
track of two beetles, possibly because of power cuts in the
transmitters.
	   ``I don't think the insects have gone off in a huff. We gave
them a good rest and extra food before the experiment began,''
Niemela said. ``It could be dead batteries or maybe they just
headed off across the car park or street nearby.''

New chairman rules out alliances
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ The new chairman of Italy's auto giant Fiat
said Thursday that the Turin-based group can succeed without
striking alliances and quashed reports that he was elected to put
Fiat up for sale.
	   ``We have the strength, the capacity and dimension to be
successful alone,'' said Paolo Fresco, who replaced Cesare Romiti
in Fiat's top post last month.
	   Stressing that Fiat would play an active role in any
combination, Fresco added ``it's clear if there are opportunities
(of alliances), we won't stand by and watch.''
	   The auto sector has been rife with speculation regarding
potential linkups since Dailmer Benz AG and Chrysler Corp.
announced a merger plan in May.
	   However, Fresco reiterated a denial of a report that Fiat and
German auto maker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) were planning a
merger of another type, such as a consortium to bid for South
Korea's Kia Motors Corp.
	   About rumors of a possible change of hands in the Agnelli
family's indirect control of the group, Fresco said:
	   ``If they intended to sell Fiat, they could have gone to a
merchant bank, not a manager. My experience isn't in the selling
(of companies), but in growth.''
	   Fresco, who joined Fiat after 37 years at General Electric,
serving most recently as vice chairman, indicated he would continue
to pursue Fiat's globalization strategy. He said the group would
maintain its focus on developing markets, with particular emphasis
in India, South America, China and Russia.

	   ZURICH (AP) _ All doping tests conducted on players during the
World Cup returned negative results, the sport's world governing
body said Thursday.
	   FIFA's doping test committee conducted a final evaluation of
specimens taken from 256 players over 64 matches before releasing
the findings.
	   Almost two-thirds of players contesting the semifinals _ from
France, Brazil, Croatia and the Netherlands _ were tested for
prohibited substances at least once.
	   Overall, doping tests were conducted on 35 percent of the 704
players in the tournament.

Colombian President sees a tough road ahead for peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Colombian President Ernesto Samper said
Thursday his country should not expect a quick and easy path to
peace even though one of its largest rebel groups made an apparent
gesture toward reconciliation.
	   Colombia's second-largest rebel group said Wednesday it would
pursue peace talks with the government and continue negotiations
with civic leaders toward ending 34 years of civil war.
	   However, the group, the leftist National Liberation Army, said
after four days of talks in Germany that it would not disarm or
cede any territory it controls while the talks were held.
	   ``There will be a difficult, complex and complicated negotiating
process,'' Samper told a news conference during a state visit here.
	   ``Peace will require sacrifices. Peace won't be free and it
won't be achieved overnight,'' he said. ``But the first steps have
been taken.''
	   Samper, who is due to step down and be replaced by
President-elect Andres Pastrana on Aug. 7, said both leftist rebels
and right-wing paramilitary groups that target rebel supporters
must be drawn to the negotiating table.
	   But they must first commit themselves to ``humanizing'' the war
by pledging not to commit civilian massacres or selective
assassinations, Samper said.
	   Samper urged Pastrana to be ``audacious'' in pursuing the peace
negotiations.

Puerto Rico strike talks to resume Friday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Union leaders consulted with their
members Thursday to determine if and when they should call off a
month-old strike against the privatization of Puerto Rico's
state-owned telephone company.
	   Talks with the government to end the walkout were suspended
until Friday to allow for the union consultations.
	   Sanctions stand in the way of resolving the walkout, which was
called to protest the sale of Puerto Rico Telephone Co. to
investors led by GTE Corp. of Stamford, Connecticut.
	   The 2,200-member Independent Brotherhood of Telephone Employees
and the 4,200-member Independent Telephone Employees Union want to
ensure that the government won't fire or suspend returning
strikers.
	   The unions also want no reprisals against thousands of public
sector employees who staged a 48-hour general strike last week in
support of the telephone workers.
	   Labor Secretary Cesar Almodovar, meanwhile, said the government
was demanding that the unions don't fine workers who crossed picket
lines during the strike, which began June 18.
	   GTE said Thursday it had submitted an ``enhanced offer'' to
acquire a controlling interest in Puerto Rico Telephone, made in
response to an 11th-hour bid by Spain's Telefonica Internacional
S.A.
	   In a complex financing arrangement, the consortium led by GTE
originally offered dlrs 1.875 billion for 50 percent plus one share
of the company. It also offered a one-year job guarantee for
current employees.
	   Telefonica hasn't released its bid, although local, unconfirmed
reports put it at roughly dlrs 2 billion for 50 percent of the
company and dlrs 2.125 billion for 60 percent.
	   GTE spokeswoman Sharon Cohen-Hagar refused to provide details on
the new offer. ``We believe that our offer is superior in every way
to TISA's,'' she said.
	   Although Gov. Pedro Rossello has signed into law legislation
authorizing the GTE-led purchase, the contract allows the
government to consider competing bids while the deal is reviewed by
U.S. federal agencies.

Talks go down to wire; U.S. mounts full-court press

	   ROME (AP) _ The haggling went down to the wire Thursday at the
U.N. negotiations on creating the world's first standing war crimes
tribunal, with the United States mounting a full-court press to
limit the court's reach.
	   Delegates from 160 countries face a Friday deadline to hammer
out a treaty creating a court to try the world's most heinous
crimes: genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.
	   The conference is split into two camps: those who want the
strongest, most independent court possible and those who want to
curb its scope.
	   The first camp includes most of America's closest allies,
Western democracies like Canada and Britain. The second includes an
array of nations not known for their sterling records on human
rights.
	   With just hours left in the negotiations, the United States was
fighting hard for a loophole that would, in effect, let the United
States veto the prosecution of American soldiers abroad.
	   With U.S. troops deployed in hot spots around the world, the
Pentagon fears its people would become the targets of politically
motivated charges.
	   The problem with the loophole is that virtually any war criminal
might use it to avoid prosecution.
	   The United States has threatened to withhold its money _ and its
muscle _ unless the court fits its prescription.
	   Rumors flew throughout the day. Was the U.S. winning converts or
was the other camp, the so-called like-minded group, holding firm?
	   As the pressure mounted, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy headed for Rome to muster the like-minded troops. The U.N.
human right commissioner, Mary Robinson, also entered the fray,
encouraging delegates to hold firm.
	   Delegates did manage to find common ground on some of the thorny
issues that had threatened to torpedo the conference. They struck a
deal on funding the court. They also reached a deal on adding
forced pregnancy to the list of war crimes, according to Bosnia's
U.N. ambassador, Muhamed Sacirbey.
	   The funding deal calls for the countries which are party to the
treaty pay most of the court's expenses.
	   The forced pregnancy issue was of special importance to Bosnia,
where tens of thousands of women were raped during the civil war,
then imprisoned until they gave birth. Most of the victims were
Muslims and Croats; their attackers were Serbs bent on reshaping
the ethnic landscape of the former Yugoslavia.
	   There was broad agreement at the conference on including rape as
a war crimes. But the Vatican and Arab countries - all foes of
abortion _ resisted including forced pregnancy.
	   They felt that endorsing the idea that forcing a woman to carry
out a pregnancy is a crime was an implicit endorsement of her right
to end that pregnancy.
	   Sacirbey said a compromise was reached in a meeting of
representatives of the Vatican, Qatar, Bahrain, Iran, Bosnia, New
Zealand, Australia and the United States. They agreed on treaty
language that made it clear the new statute does not supersede
national laws prohibiting abortion, he said.

Council agrees on more personnel for judiciary in Bosnia

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council decided Thursday to
establish a small group to monitor courts in Bosnia as part of the
overall program to reform the legal system called for by the Dayton
peace accords.
	   In a resolution, the 15-member council asked Bosnian authorities
to cooperate with the new team.
	   The group would consist of about 35 people, including three
officers in each of the seven regions where U.N. civilian police
operate, as well as five officers to analyze their reports. The
team would also use Bosnian nationals in each region to act as a
liason with local court officials and be assisted by administrative
staff.
	   U.S. Ambassador Bill Richardson, while welcoming the creation of
the program, said the United States objected to using peacekeeping
funds for what he said was essentially a development issue.
	   ``Nevertheless, we are willing to make an exception in this case
because of the unique nature of the U.S. and international
commitments to peacekeeping in Bosnia and Herzegovina,'' he said in
a statement.
	   The additions will expand the U.N. presence in Bosnia, where
about 2,000 civilian police oversee the civilian components of the
Dayton accords, which ended 3 1-2 years of fighting.
	   The police train and monitor officers from the Serb, Muslim and
Croat communities and oversee the return of refugees and the
building of institutions governing the Bosnian Serb portion of the
country and parts administered by the Muslim-Croat Federation.

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze
checked into the central military hospital Thursday to have a
kidney stone removed, the presidential press service said.
	   The press service confirmed that Shevardnadze underwent a minor
bloodless operation to crush the stone. His work schedule will not
be affected the service said.
	   Shevardnadze narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in
February, when gunmen opened fire on the president's motorcade. Two
bodyguards were killed, but Shevardnadze was unharmed.
	   Afterward, Shevardnadze asserted that his physical health had
never been better.

consortium of Raytheon of Massachusetts, India's Tata Group and
Singapore's Changai Airport Authority have pulled out of a dlrs 630
million airport project in southern India, a company official said
Thursday.
	   Press Trust of India quoted an unidentified official of Tata,
one of India's largest business conglomerates, as saying the three
project partners had decided to pull out of the airport project
near the southern city of Bangalore.
	   The airport was to be built at Devanhalli near Bangalore and
would handle 15,000 passengers and 400 tons of cargo each day,
Thursday's Business Line newspaper reported.
	   Bangalore presently shares its civilian airport with the Indian
Air Force on property owned by the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics
Limited (HAL).
	   According to the agreement signed in 1995 between the federal
government and the consortium, civilian commercial operations at
the HAL airport were to be shut down and all traffic handled by the
new facility, the Tata official said.
	   The official claimed the government had now decided to continue
civilian operations from the HAL-run airport, forcing the
consortium's withdrawal from the project, the reports said.
	   International financiers saw risk in the project as Bangalore's
annual traffic of 1.9 million passengers is too small to be shared
by two airports, Business Line said.
	   The project partners had started losing interest last year
because the Indian government insisted on eventually owning the
airport, newspaper reports had then said. The consortium was
contracted to own and run the airport indefinitely but the
government of Karnataka wanted to take over the facility after a
few decades.

After cease-fire, U.N. ready to deliver food to starving Sudanese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United Nations put in place Thursday
plans to deliver food to a multitude of hungry people in southern
Sudan after the government and a rebel group agreed on a
three-month cease-fire.
	   The U.N.'s World Food Program will begin flying on Friday an
Ilyushin-76 aircraft out of Khartoum to deliver food to the Bahr
el-Ghazal province where an estimated 701,000 people are facing
famine, the WFP's resource director, Tun Myat, told reporters.
	   He said another three Il-76 aircraft will join the fleet in the
coming days.
	   The WFP estimates that outside Bahr el-Ghazal some 1.9 million
more Sudanese are in urgent need of food. The WFP plans to deliver
15,000 tons of food per month in Sudan over the next four months.
The program will cost dlrs 84 million.
	   Meanwhile, at a separate news conference, Sudan's Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail warned the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army not to take advantage of the truce that began
Wednesday.
	   ``We will observe the cease-fire and will not use it to attack
the other side,'' Ismail said.
	   ``But if it (cease-fire) is used as a trick to attack us, we
will defend ourselves,'' he told the news conference that was also
addressed by visiting British Foreign Office minister Derek
Fatchett.
	   Fatchett had met with both sides to help secure the cease-fire,
which calls for setting up safe corridors into southern Sudan for
the delivery of relief and humanitarian supplies.
	   The truce ``should also give renewed confidence to the Sudanese
government and the SPLA to engage in a broader political
discussion,'' Fatchett said.
	   The government had responded Wednesday to the SPLA cease-fire
with a one-month truce, but Ismail said Thursday that the military
will suspend the war for three months, ``hoping that this will lead
to an open cease-fire.''
	   Fighting between the SPLA and government troops has prevented
people from planting crops and has made delivery of relief food
difficult. The area is also suffering from drought.
	   Myat, the WFP official, said the U.N. intends to deliver food
through three safe passage corridor to Bahr el-Ghazal that will be
opened under the cease-fire terms:
	   _ by trucks on a road from Koboko in Uganda;
	   _ on ferries sailing down the Bahr el-Ghazal river from Kosti in
northern Sudan;
	   _ and by two trains every month from Babanusa in northern Sudan
to Bahr el-Ghazal's biggest city, Wau.
	   Problems, however, were already cropping up for the WFP outside
Bahr el-Ghazal region.
	   Two WFP staffers were forced to flee insecurity in the western
Upper Nile town of Leer Thursday where they were just starting food
distribution for 30,000 people, said Michele Quintaglie, a WFP
spokeswoman in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
	   The aid workers were contacted by radio and no other details
were available, Quintaglie said.
	   It was not clear if the staffers were blocked by government
troops or SPLA soldiers.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy for the
the predominantly African, Christian and animist south that has
historically been dominated by the Muslim and Arabized north. An
estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
resulting famines.

France rolls out red carpet for Assad, hoping visit will pay off
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Syria's red, white and black flag flew on the
Champs-Elysees Thursday, a sign of the red-carpet treatment France
is giving President Hafez Assad in hopes his rare visit could bring
a new dimension to the Mideast peace process.
	   But the two-day state visit -- the first here in 22 years -- was
also cause for controversy.
	   Families of Holocaust victims protested Assad's silence on the
whereabouts of accused war criminal Alois Brunner, said to be
hiding in Syria; the Committee for a Free Lebanon was demonstrating
against Syrian occupation of Lebanon; a human rights group demanded
Syria free political prisoners.
	   President Jacques Chirac was meeting twice with Assad, Thursday
and Friday, and holding a state dinner for him Thursday night at
the Elysee Palace.
	   The high-level welcome was a sign of French hopes that Assad's
visit will pay off with improved ties and trade and, more
importantly, with new impetus to the blocked Middle East peace
process.
	   Chirac, who visited Damascus in 1996, has actively sought a
clear role for France, and Europe, in the peace process, and Assad,
who is seeking an alternative to American mediation, could provide
it.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy to break the lengthy impasse. And French
intervention in the region has occasionally advanced the process
where American policy failed.
	   During Israel's offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon in 1996, France engineered a truce that still
stands. And last month, France guaranteed an exchange of prisoners
and soldiers' remains between Lebanon and Israel.
	   In May, France and Egypt jointly proposed an international
conference to save the peace process -- certain to be discussed
with Assad.
	   Syria is demanding Israel hand over the Golan Heights, seized in
1967, in exchange for peace. This is in keeping with the
land-for-peace formula that underpins the peace process.
	   ``(Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu says he wants
peace for peace, a motto which means that he wants to retain our
land and also take peace from us,'' Assad said in a television
interview aired Wednesday night by France's TF1 station.
	   Asked if Syria would withdraw from southern Lebanon if Israel
gave up the strategic Golan Heights, Assad replied: ``I don't see
the link between the two.''
	   The austere Assad, 67, has not left his region since a 1994
meeting with President Clinton in Geneva, and passions surpassing
politics were stirred by his arrival here.
	   Groups representing families of Holocaust victims demonstrated
Thursday evening, angered by Assad's failure to respond to French
queries about the alleged presence in Syria of Nazi war criminal
Alois Brunner, 87, blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from
Germany, Austria, France and Greece.
	   The Committee for a Free Lebanon planned a sit-in to protest
Syrian troops in Lebanon.
	   The International Human Rights Federation this week asked Assad
to immediately free what it claimed were at least 2,000 Syrian
political prisoners as well as nearly three dozen Lebanese held, it
said, illegally.

Six killed, 14 wounded in attempt to loot food relief trucks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Six gunmen died and another 14 were
wounded Thursday in an attempt to loot a 28-truck convoy of relief
food headed for flood-stricken southern Somalia, witnesses said.
	   Armed guards escorting the convoy organized by the U.N. World
Food Program shot back after the gunmen manning a checkpoint on the
road south out of the Somali capital opened fire on the trucks.
	   Witnesses said the gunmen at the checkpoint managed to seize two
of the trucks and drive them to a former university campus now
controlled by south Mogadishu warlord Hassan Osman Ali, better know
as Atto.
	   Four other trucks remained pinned in the crossfire between the
gunmen and the guards. The other 22 vehicles managed to continue.
	   Among the seriously wounded was one of Atto's chief commanders,
Col. Abdi Sheikh Hussein, known by the nickname Col. Arrabey.
	   Sources in Atto's headquarters said the attackers were renegades
from Atto's armed faction who are opposed to his rule.
	   Earlier this week, Atto joined forces with reigning south
Mogadishu warlord Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, who
controls the northern half of the war-torn city, to remove move
than 50 roadblocks manned by freelance gunmen along the main
north-south axis in the capital.
	   The three faction leaders have been attempting to put together a
central administration in the city and to re-open the main
international airport and Red Sea port, which have been closed
since U.N. peacekeepers withdrew in March 1995.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since Aidid's late
father, Gen. Mohamed Farah Aidid, and Ali Mahdi joined forces to
oust dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in January 1991, then turned on
each other.

Locals revolting after critic takes a swipe at an English country
</HEADLINE>
town &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ ``The locals are revolting'' sums up one newspaper
critic's attitude to an ancient English country town _ and the
townspeoples' reaction to him.
	   Copies of the Times of London were being burned in the center of
Taunton in response to a damning article about the southwest
English agricultural town by critic Jonathan Meades.
	   Meades, who produces caustic TV programs and newspaper articles
about provincial England, implied in a Times' article July 4 that
the local men of Taunton preferred four-legged friends over the
two-legged kind sexually, and that the population was genetically
challenged by inbreeding.
	   Meades, who was in Taunton to review a restaurant but spent four
``miserable'' years at school there in the 1960s, also said the
Somerset county town ``always seemed particularly uncouth in a
boorish, West Country way _ unleavened by much physical beauty, and
it was the playground of squaddies and agri-yobs,'' a reference to
the soldiers and agricultural workers who drink in the town's pubs.
	   He also wondered where the locals parked their combine
harvesters when they came into town.
	   Local lawmaker Jackie Ballard complained in the House of Commons
about Meades' comments, and Taunton's mayor, Ted Softley, was
equally unimpressed.
	   ``I think he is a very sad man,'' Softley said. ``People are
furious about what has been written.''
	   Meades, however, appeared unrepentant, saying he was surprised
people in Taunton had even read his article.
	   ``I suppose the one person in Taunton who can read must have
read it out to the rest of them,'' The Times quoted him as saying.
	   Oh, and by the way, Meades liked the restaurant.

	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	    &UR; ___
	   Belfast Telegraph, Belfast, Northern Ireland, on murder of Quinn
brothers:
	   For the sake of our children, was a phrase much used in May
during the run-up to the Referendum. Back then the Troubles had
taken its toll on 257 young lives.
	   The murder of brothers Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn is a
tragedy, not just for their grieving family, but for all of us.
	   How a hand could fill a bottle with petrol, light it and throw
it into a house where children lie sleeping is beyond most of us.
Yet that is what happened on Sunday morning. And every morning for
a week.
	   Hundreds of people have been burned out, intimidated, made
homeless in the week of the Drumcree siege.
	   And we accepted it. After all, no one was seriously hurt. Until
now.
	   To be fair, this is not just a parade problem. It is something
that has gone on for more than 30 years. We may talk about justice
and rights and equality but this is really about an us-and-them
thing. ...
	   Nearly a year ago,Ulster went into a frenzy of grief after the
death of Diana, Princess of Wales.
	   But I have to ask what kind of society are we that will mourn
the passing of a Princess who was rarely here but will barely lift
a hand or say a word to save our own children? ...
	    &UR; ___
	   La Nacion, Buenos Aires, on Northern Ireland:
	   ... Today in Northern Ireland, there exists a real commitment to
achieving understanding and putting to rest the struggles and
differences that have pitted Catholics and Protestants against each
other for centuries. But regrettably, there still exist those
intransigent and belligerent minorities (whose) one and only aim is
to continue sowing terror, and in such a way, hinder the road that
would seem to lead to peace. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Times, London, on Japan's economy:
	   When Ryutaro Hashimoto became Prime Minister of Japan 30 months
ago he said that he would ``go down in flames'' if he failed to
turn around Japan's moribund economy. But neither he nor anyone
else expected Japan's voters to light so fierce a bonfire.
	   In burying Hashimoto, it is right to offer some praise. His
foreign policies have been courageous, particularly in
strengthening the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. But what counts is
that he plunged Japan into needless recession. The voters were
right to blame him personally _ and dead right to make their views
so plain that he had no option but to resign. Without radical
action, the mess he has made of Japan's economy could yet drag the
world into depression. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   La Repubblica, Rome, on Japan's elections:
	   The leader who loses, resigns. On this occasion Japan is to be
admired. In a country where honor, even political honor is
significant, Ryutaro Hashimoto decided to present his resignation
when the results from the ballot boxes became known.
	   This admission of guilt is very rare in politics.
	   But beyond the gesture itself, the resignation of Hashimoto is
followed by a series of question marks regarding the continuation
of reformist policies in Tokyo. ...
	   This political uncertainty has alarmed the markets and worried
the U.S. and Europe.
	   Japan can only solve its crisis if it understands the meaning of
this vote: Japanese people expect more pervasive reforms to revive
the country's economy.
	    &UR; ___
	   Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Japan's election:
	   Voters had vented their anger at the failed economic policies of
Hashimoto's Cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). We
feel, therefore, that it is only fitting that the prime minister
and the leaders of the LDP should resign.
	   The LDP has already begun the process of selecting a successor
to Hashimoto. A Cabinet would normally be compelled to dissolve the
Diet and hold elections for the House of Representatives after such
a humiliating setback. But Japan needs to respond immediately to
its economic crisis and cannot allow a political vacuum to develop.
	   After passing emergency economic and financial legislation
during the extraordinary Diet session, the new Cabinet must
dissolve the Diet and hold early elections in order to win the
confidence of the people. The new Cabinet should be content to
manage the economic crisis and prepare for the next election.
	    &UR; ___
	   Times of India, New Delhi, on Japan's election:
	   In ordinary times, the fall of yet another Japanese prime
minister would not be such big news. But these are not ordinary
times. If Japan fails to recover, it will drag much of Asia down
the tube and also rattle economies as far afield as Russia, Chile
and Brazil. Thus, the world anxiously waits to see what concrete
steps Mr. (Ryutaro) Hashimoto's successor will take to revive the
economy. The options, of course, are limited and will have to
include sweeping bank reforms and a broad reflationary package.
There are indications Mr. Hashimoto was beginning to grapple with
this reality, though the measures he undertook were halfhearted and
too diffused to instill much confidence. If his exit has opened up
the possibility for change, it is only because voters have
demonstrated that mismanagement of the economy will not go
unpunished.

U.N. panel concerned about Israeli practices

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Israel's detention of Palestinian prisoners
without charge or trial presents major human-rights problems, a
U.N. panel of experts said Thursday.
	   The Human Rights Committee said it is concerned about Israeli
discrimination against Palestinians in Israel and in occupied
areas.
	   Israeli officials said its measures were needed for national
security and that the controversial practice of administrative
detention applies to Jews as well.
	   Members of the panel said Israel's use of emergency powers
should be independently reviewed and that the country should adopt
a bill of rights.
	   The committee of 18 independent human-rights experts was
examining Israel's first report on its implementation of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it
ratified in 1991.
	   It also said Israel's application of different standards on
freedom of movement discriminated against Palestinians.
	   Committee members and human rights groups criticized the Israeli
government for failing to include in its report details about the
human rights situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Human rights groups had urged the committee to take the country
to task on a range of issues including the killings of Palestinians
by Israeli troops, Israel's use of physical force in interrogations
of Palestinian suspects, the arbitrary detention of dozens of
prisoners without charge or trial, and ``unfair'' trials of
Palestinians in Israeli military courts.
	   Christine Chanet of France, who chairs the committee, said at
the end of the two-day session that the committee had considered as
particular problems Israel's practices in the occupied territories.
	   Different standards for the movement of Palestinians and Jews
amount to discrimination, Chanet said.
	   Israeli officials said there is an internal review system to
ensure the country lives up to its international obligations.
Individuals with complaints against the country's authorities have
redress through Israel's judicial system, they said.
	   They said the extraordinary measures had to be taken when the
existence of Israel or the security of its people are threatened by
terrorist operations.
	   Chanet said the committee rejected that argument.
	   ``That is their position, security,'' she said. ``We say, no,
you have no justification for discrimination.''
	   She said the government would have to respect all the guidelines
in the convention in order to be able to claim it was upholding it.
	   The committee, which periodically reviews the reports of each of
some 140 governments who have ratified the accord, will publish its
full conclusions on Israel July 31.
	   The Association of Civil Rights in Israel claimed the Israeli
officials ``avoided answering difficult issues'' put to it by the
committee.
	   ``We didn't always feel they were completely up front,'' said
spokeswoman Hadas Tagari.

	   The Jordan Times, Amman, on U.N.-Palestine:
	   The General Assembly's decision to upgrade Palestine's status in
the U.N. from that of an observer to a virtual state is a de facto
recognition of the national rights of the Palestinians to establish
their own independent state. Much to the dismay of the Americans
and the Israelis, the motion in the U.N. passed with an
overwhelming majority.
	   The significance of the upgrading lies in the new powers given
to the Palestinians in the U.N., rather than on just the ceremonial
and symbolic meaning behind the move.
	   What is perhaps of even greater significance is that the May
1999 deadline for the termination of the Palestinian-Israeli Oslo
peace accords is fast approaching, with PLO President Yasser Arafat
threatening to unilaterally declare a Palestinian state in parts of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
	   This designation has proved to gauge international opinion with
regards to a future Palestinian state. If the present Israeli
government is farsighted enough, it would do well to its
international standing to heed the wishes of the Palestinians and
go forth with the overdue second and third troop withdrawals from
the West Bank in accordance with signed agreements. That, instead
of issuing threats to further annex Palestinian lands where a
Palestinian state will be established, whether Israel likes it or
not.

	   The Sydney Morning Herald, Sydney, Australia, on Japan:
	   It's all my fault,'' said a contrite Ryutaro Hashimoto, taking
the blame for the electoral setback of Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic Party in Sunday's Upper House election and resigning as
prime minister. Well, yes and no. Hashimoto could have moved
earlier in his 2 1/2 years as prime minister to put the Japanese
economy _ and the engine of much of Asia's prosperity _ back on
track and when he did move it could have been more decisively. But
Hashimoto did try harder than his predecessors to stimulate the
domestic economy and overhaul Japan's banking system. It is just
that his efforts weren't good enough.
	   What were the larger forces working against him? Chief among
them is Japan's political system itself. For one thing an electoral
gerrymander ensures that older, more conservative rural voters
whose numbers are spread thinly and whose livelihoods often depend
on government subsidies and state protectionist policies, are over
represented in the legislature.
	   Then there is the question of political leadership _ or rather
the lack of it. In Japan politicians act like front men for
bureaucrats who are themselves averse to reform because it might
loosen their grip on power or upset vested interests. Trying to
pursue structural reform, eliminate trade barriers or stimulate
domestic demand can be like trying to make water flow uphill.
	   Whoever Hashimoto's successor is will be subject to these same
larger forces. But given the lackluster line-up of contenders ...
it may be that the next prime minister lacks even Hasimoto's
leadership strengths.
	   Further reform is precisely what Japan needs, what its trading
partners are urging and what Japan's voters seem to be demanding.
Hashimoto said after announcing his intention to stand down: ``I am
confident that the policies (of reform) will be continued.'' It is
to be hoped that this expression of confidence, just as Hashimoto's
acknowledgement of blame, is not an entirely individual thing.

	   The Straits Times, Singapore, on Japan:
	   Japanese voters have given a clear signal of what they think is
wrong with the economy: bad politics. The reverses suffered by the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party in Sunday elections to the Upper
House are nothing less than a vote of no-confidence in a system
that is palpably incapable of dealing with the malaise that has
settled on the world's second largest economy.
	   The vote is a protest, and a warning, against the way Japan is
being run. It is being administered as if the economic crisis were
but a passing phase, an aberration which the institutionalized
practices of post-War Japan would absorb, more or less as easily as
they overcame previous challenges.
	   But this recession is different. It calls into question, not so
much the ability of Japanese practices to prevail, but the right of
several of them to exist at all. Among those practices is the
traditionally close link between the financial and political
systems. Japan's economy need structural reforms, not cosmetic
tinkering, if the changes initiated by the promised bridge bank
scheme and tax cuts are to be sustained.

	   Le Monde, Paris, on Syrian President Hafez Assad's visit:
	   The least one can say about Hafez Assad is that he is very
controversial. The Syrian president, (who is on a two-day state
visit to France), is neither a champion of human rights nor a
follower of democracy. He is not a known friend of the West or an
indispensable commercial partner, for which the economic and
financial importance (of his country) could lead to forgetting
abuses. ... Paris believes today it is better to act in Lebanon and
in the Middle East with Syria, rather than against it. The French
leaders are perhaps not wrong to try to integrate rather than
exclude him.

	   Cape Cod Times, Hyannis, Massachusetts, on Viagra:
	   Thirty-one men seeking to restore the sex life of their youth
have paid the worst price. They've died. They died believing that
the medication they'd taken _ Viagra, the hottest-selling drug in
the market _ was safe for them.
	   Although Pfizer Inc., the drug's manufacturer, along with the
Food and Drug Administration, insist the drug is safe, the consumer
group Public Citizen may have found a deadly exception.
	   Pfizer refused to admit men with certain heart-related
conditions into its trials of the drug, but men with those
conditions are allowed to take Viagra anyway, and some have
suffered heart attacks or strokes, Public Citizen says. ...
	   The FDA, despite its insistence on Viagra's safety, has agreed
to consider the concerns Public Citizen has raised. Another fad has
overcome reason. So many men are so eager to reap Viagra's
rejuvenating benefits that they have thrown reason and caution to
the wind.
	   In some cases, so have their doctors. ... Life is precious _
don't lose it in a blind leap to regain a bit of your youth.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Miami Herald, on Japan's economy:
	   In American movie houses this summer, doomsday comes via
asteroids and space aliens conspiring to take over the world. In
reality, the likelier doomsday comes when Japan's economy
collapses. ...
	   Such is today's global economy: Japan twitches, Southeast Asia
teeters, and South Floridians suddenly have reason to cringe at
what might come next.
	   On the optimistic side, Japanese voters ... sent a clear message
to their leaders and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party: Right the
economy! The immediate result was Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto's resignation. ...
	   So what does happen next?
	   A happy ending would have a bold new leader rising from the
ashes of the LDP losses to take charge and do what has to be done
despite the pain. ... It is by no means certain that Japanese
voters, though clearly ready for action, have been prepared for
painful action. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   North County Times, Escondido, California, on Northern Ireland:
	   Protestants in Northern Ireland marched Monday in commemoration
of their biggest holiday, the defeat of a Catholic king by William
of Orange in 1690. But a pall hung over the usually raucous
celebrations _ a pall that might just signal this war-weary end of
Ireland is finally ready to accept peace.
	   Years ago, the firebombing death Sunday morning of three
Catholic boys would probably have sparked a whole new wave of
retribution shootings and bombings by the Irish Republican Army or
one of its many parallel militant Catholic groups. But the horrible
attack instead seems to have numbed the country and laid bare the
senselessness of the violence that has gripped the land for
generations. ...
	   Protestant leaders called for silent observances at all
gatherings Monday, and Catholics, who often try to disrupt the
parades ..., avoided most confrontations. ...
	   Nothing, of course, could justify the killing of the boys. What
would be worse is if their deaths are used to rationalize more
killing and to unravel the tenuous peace before, like the Quinn
boys, it has a chance at life.
	   Springfield News-Sun, Springfield, Ohio, on CNN retraction of
military-nerve gas story:
	   Cable News Network did the only thing it could last week when it
admitted that its sensational account of nerve-gas attacks on
suspected American defectors in Vietnam was unsupported by fact. In
its haste to accuse the Pentagon of indiscriminately using deadly
nerve gas in Vietnam, CNN twisted facts, suppressed evidence and
misquoted witnesses.
	   Things get worse. The story's primary source, a onetime Army
lieutenant, has asserted that his knowledge of the alleged incident
was based on ``repressed memories,'' an exceedingly shaky source of
information.
	   It is a measure of the estrangement of news organizations such
as CNN from the American mainstream that its producers, editors and
reporters should have characterized such outrageous myths, and gone
to such lengths to publicize an insult to the brave men who fought
in that war 30 years ago.

Russia's parliament passes key element of austerity package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with lawmakers passing sales tax after
chiding from finance minister, market close, initial approval for
income tax. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament passed a key element of
President Boris Yeltsin's austerity plan late Thursday following a
chastising from the finance minister.
	   Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, adopted a law on a
national sales tax on a third reading after initially rejecting the
measure along with a land tax.
	   The Duma also adopted a bill setting forth the general
principles for tax collection and gave initial approval to an
amendment on the personal income tax law.
	   After the Duma rejected two important measures that were
designed to raise revenue for the cash-strapped government _ the
sales tax and land tax _ Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov
criticized lawmakers for failure to support a program that could
lead the country out of its economic crisis.
	   ``The key points which should lead the country out of crisis
have not been supported by you,'' Zadornov told parliament.
	   Lawmakers, meeting late into the evening on the second day of a
special Duma session devoted to the government's austerity plan,
reconsidered the sales tax and adopted it on a third and final
reading.
	   The International Monetary Fund and other lenders want the
austerity program in place before releasing funds from a
multi-billion-dollar loan package that was agreed on Monday.
	   Russian stocks, which made gains of about 28 percent earlier in
the week, dropped 4.8 percent Thursday when profit-taking increased
after the lawmakers balked at tax reforms.
	   The Communists and nationalists in parliament generally oppose
spending cuts and tax hikes, arguing that such measures will hurt
ordinary Russians.
	   Yeltsin's administration has sent more than 20 proposals to
parliament, saying they are needed to ensure the loan package and
end the country's latest financial crisis.
	   But the president has indicated that he will implement some
austerity measures by decree if the parliament does not enact them.
	   If parliament were to oppose important parts of the austerity
plan, the International Monetary Fund could find itself in an
awkward position when its board meets Monday in Washington to
review the Russian loan deal.
	   The IMF and others do not want to release the loans until they
are convinced Russia is serious about financial reform, but the
Russian markets are likely to crash if assistance doesn't arrive
soon.
	   The international loan agreement would bring dlrs 17.1 billion
in new funds this year and next to help stabilize financial
markets.
	   The Communists are wary of the loan package, saying it could
saddle Russia with debt it cannot afford to repay. But Russia
already must pay off billions of dollars in short-term debt that
will be due in coming months, and it probably can't meet the
payments without the new loans, analysts say.
	   The proposed loans are to come from three sources: the IMF, the
World Bank and the Japanese government. When combined with
already-negotiated loans, the package totals dlrs 22.6 billion
spread over this year and next.

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The search for a Berlin boy who disappeared five
years ago may have led police in the Netherlands to the alleged
international child pornography ring uncovered Thursday.
	   Manuel Schadwald was 12 when he disappeared from his home on
July 24, 1993 without a trace. Numerous official and private
investigations have failed to find him, although there were signs
that he had fallen into the hands of Dutch child pornographers.
	   Berlin's chief prosecutor, Juergen Karge, announced this spring
that the case had been closed after his investigators failed to
find any evidence that a crime had been committed.
	   But the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper, which has closely
followed the case, reported in April about accusations of sloppy
work by German and Dutch police.
	   After much public outcry, Berlin prosecutors met in late April
with Marcel Vervloesem, a private detective from a Belgian group
called Morkhoven that fights child pornography. Vervloesem said he
gave the police extensive evidence and the names of two previously
unknown suspects.
	   On Thursday, the newspaper reported that Vervloesem and its
reporter in Amsterdam met with a 22-year-old Belgian man, who told
them he was a friend of Schadwald's. The Belgian said the boy, now
17, was living in Amsterdam and involved in a child pornography
network, the newspaper said.
	   The Belgian then fled with a Dutch man, it said.
	   Vervloesem told the newspaper his group searched the Dutch man's
apartment and found a cache of child pornography, as well as
computer diskettes with contact addresses, including many in
Berlin.
	   Dutch media, however, reported Thursday that the apartment was
owned by a German, identified as G. Ulrich, who they said was
recently murdered in Italy by a fellow gang member, apparently
because he had tipped off police about the ring's activities.
	   Vervloesem said the apartment's owner was shot dead by the young
Belgian man, who he said was sitting in an Italian jail in Pisa
awaiting extradition.
	   Berlin police said they were waiting to be briefed on the
results of the raid by their Dutch and Belgian colleagues before
commenting.

Swiss government, banks decline to take part in D'Amato hearing
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Swiss Banks-Nazis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ Switzerland's government and banks will
decline to testify at a new hearing of the U.S. Senate Banking
Committee on World War II, an official said.
	   The refusal to appear at the hearing called by U.S. Senator
Alfonse D'Amato added to tensions between the United States and
Switzerland in the wrangling over dealings by the neutral Swiss
with the Nazis.
	   Thomas Borer, the Swiss diplomat heading the country's task
force on its wartime past, said he has repeatedly testified at
hearings of the U.S. Congress.
	   He said the decision by the Swiss banks and government against
participating would detract from the publicity value of the
hearings for D'Amato.
	   Borer said the far-reaching measures introduced by Switzerland
to make good on any wartime wrongs are well known.
	   D'Amato said last month said the committee would expand its
investigations into Swiss banks and look at re-examination of the
1946 Washington accord which was supposed to have settled claims
over Nazi gold.
	   Under that agreement, Switzerland paid the Allies 250 million
Swiss francs (dlrs 58 million at January 1946 conversion rates)
toward European reconstruction. The Allies waived all other
gold-related claims against Switzerland.
	   ``Renegotiation of the Washington agreement is out of the
question,'' Switzerland's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
``The agreement was finalized, ratified and implemented in a
legally binding manner.''
	   Borer told D'Amato in a letter that he was declining an
invitation the senator made last Friday to represent the Swiss
position at the hearing next Wednesday.
	   Among Switzerland's efforts to make amends for any wrongdoing
are a fund to help needy survivors of the Holocaust, a U.S.-led
audit of dormant assets in Swiss banks and an international panel
of historians examining the country's wartime past.
	   Those efforts have drawn praise from U.S. and Israeli
authorities.
	   ``Considering these facts and the questionable linkage of the
unclaimed assets issue with the Washington agreement, Borer sees no
reason to testify,'' the Swiss statement concluded.
	   The panel of historians, the umbrella Swiss Bankers Association
and the country's central bank also declined to attend.
	   The only Swiss figure who accepted was Jean Ziegler, an
outspoken critic of Swiss banks in the parliament. He said he was
going as a ``solitary intellectual.''
	   D'Amato says his committee's inquiry so far has estimates that
the Swiss kept anywhere from dlrs 414 million to dlrs 816 million _
or dlrs 4 billion to dlrs 8 billion in today's dollars _ from
Germany, including gold from national treasuries as well as victim
assets.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Mario Zagallo, the coach of the
Brazilian national soccer team, dismissed criticism that he allowed
the team's star forward, Ronaldo, to play despite suffering
convulsions hours before the World Cup final, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The owner of Ronaldo's Italian club, Massimo Moratti criticized
Zagallo for allowing Ronaldo to play after he suffered from
convulsion just hour's before Sunday's World Cup final.
	   ``The Brazilian federation behaved in an absurd manner,''
Moratti told reporters on Tuesday.
	   O Estado de Sao Paulo quoted Zagallo as saying that Moratti
himself put undue pressure on Ronaldo. He encouraged fans and
journalists to support Ronaldo.
	   ``Ronaldo needs support as a human being. ... He is going
through an ordeal,'' Zagallo was quoted in O Estado de Sao Paulo.
	   A spokesman for the Brazilian Soccer Confederation could not be
reached for comment immediately.
	   Ronaldo was shown on TV Globo News walking passed reporters
outside his mother's house without comment on Thursday. He has
repeatedly refused to speak with reporters who have pursued him
relentlessly since his return from France earlier this week.

Shipowner remanded in custody pending trial for attempted murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) _ A member of one of Greece's most
prominent shipping families was remanded in custody Thursday
pending his trial for the attempted murder of a business rival.
	   Vangelis Ventouris, 39, has been accused of shooting rival
shipowner Constantinos Agapitos, 40, as he waited at a traffic
light in Greece's main port city of Piraeus, about 10 kilometers
(six miles) south of Athens.
	   No date was set for the trial.
	   Agapitos, who is recovering in hospital from gunshot wounds to
the legs and arms, identified Ventouris as one of two men who
attacked him early Monday as they drove past his car on a
motorcycle.
	   Ventouris has denied any involvement in the attack, saying he
was watching the World Cup final with three friends when it
occurred.
	   Agapitos has told authorities he began receiving threatening
telephone calls after his recent purchase of the ferry Panagia
Tinou II, which had been seized by the National Bank from Ventouris
Sea Lines, run by Vangelis Ventouris.
	   Agapitos, whose family owns the Agapitos Lines passenger
ferries, is in charge of the Agapitos Express Ferries division,
which serves the Aegean's Cycladic islands.

Draw will decide Serie A referees next season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Following a season marred by controversial referee
decisions, the Italian soccer Federation on Thursday ruled that a
draw will decide umpires for the 1998-99 soccer campaign.
	   The new system, suggested by Italy's professional soccer league
and opposed by the referees association, was intended to curb
protests by clubs over wrong decisions by league-appointed
referees.
	   The referees will be drawn for both Serie A and second-division
matches.
	   The Italian title showdown between Juventus and Inter Milan last
season was decided by questionable referee decisions which prompted
bitter protests by Massimo Moratti, the president of losing side
Inter.

Strong quake shakes western Greece
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A strong earthquake rattled western Greece
on Thursday, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or
serious damage.
	   The temblor, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.3, occurred at
8:29 p.m. (1729 GMT) under the seabed off the western coast of the
Ionian island of Lefkada, 290 kilometers (180 miles) northwest of
Athens, the Athens Geodynamic Institute said.
	   A quake of moment magnitude 2.5 to 3 is the smallest generally
felt by people. A quake of magnitude 4 often causes slight damage.
	   Magnitude 5 can produce moderate damage. Magnitude 6 causes
severe damage under a populate area, while a magnitude seven
indicates a major earthquake capable of widespread, heavy damage.

 &UR; Serbian police raid ethnic Albanian headquarters &QL;

Prizren; Albanian raid on mine; no pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a warning to ethnic Albanian
leaders, Serb police raided the headquarters of Kosovo's largest
Albanian party Thursday while fighting was reported for the first
time in a strategic area south of this provincial capital.
	   Police seized documents at the office of the Democratic League
of Kosovo, or LDK, but made no arrests moments after members of the
province's self-styled parliament _ meeting for the first time _
swore in party leader Ibrahim Rugova as president.
	   In a statement, police said they ``prevented an attempt to
constitute the so-called `parliament of the Republic of Kosovo,'''
whose members were elected March 22 in an unauthorized balloting.
	   Police said the local prosecutor was considering filing criminal
charges. But the fact that police waited until the meeting was over
suggested the government was not seriously attempting to muzzle
Rugova, whom the United States and the Europeans see as the
Albanian politician most capable of conducting future peace talks
with the Yugoslav government.
	   Rugova has called for independence for Kosovo, which the
Americans and Europeans oppose. Instead, they support autonomy for
Kosovo, a province of Serbia where Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1. Serbia is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Despite his support for independence, Rugova's renunciation of
violence has made him more acceptable to the United States and
Europe as a negotiating partner than the extremist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Rugova's party holds 90 percent of the seats in the 120-member
assembly, because most of the 15 other Albanian parties boycotted
the March vote.
	   The LDK's secretary-general, Nekibe Kelmendi, said the fact that
the parliament convened at all was ``a historic act and the result
of a new reality in the region which the international community
will have to consider.''
	   Although Rugova has international backing, his non-violent stand
has cost him considerable support among the Albanian community _
angered by the five-month Serb crackdown on the KLA in which
hundreds have died.
	   Rugova apparently hoped that convening the parliament would
bolster his political stature, even if the Serb government never
permits it to function.
	   Outside the provincial capital, Serb sources reported new
clashes Thursday between the KLA and security forces in several
areas.
	   The Serb Media Center said a ``large group'' of Albanians
attacked a police patrol near Prizren, about 60 kilometers (37
miles) southwest of Pristina and withdrew after a two-hour
gunbattle.
	   There was no report of casualties. But the fighting was the
first reported in the Prizren area. Earlier, Serb sources reported
KLA rebels attacked a patrol late Thursday near Urosevac, about 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Friday's fighting.
	   One Albanian was killed, the Serb report said. Urosevac controls
the main highway between Pristina and the Macedonian capital,
Skopje, and the fighting could signal a KLA attempt to block a
major transport artery.
	   In reporting on the Prizren clashes, the Kosovo Information
Center, close to Rugova's party, said Serbian police set fire to
three Albanian homes near the town and that heavy gunfire could be
heard in the area.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said Albanian fighters attacked a lead
and zinc mine 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina but
were driven off. Rebels control most of that area except for the
mine itself.
	   In their account of the mine clash, Albanian sources said police
shelled seven KLA-controlled villages in the area late Thursday but
there were no casualties.
	   The Albanian center also reported that fighting in the Decane
region of western Kosovo had claimed two lives of two ethnic
Albanians in the past two days.
	   Five Albanians wounded Thursday when Serb forces shelled the
village of Dobrosevac, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of
Pristina, the Albanians said.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.

Officials report malfunction at Bulgarian nuclear plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Operators at Bulgaria's only nuclear
power plant Thursday reported that a ``malfunction'' caused a
slight increase in radiation levels around the facility.
	   Higher gamma radiation levels were briefly registered during
standard technological operations around noon in and near the
reactor hall of Unit Two, which has been stopped for refuelling,
the Committee for the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy announced.
	   According to a press release by the government agency, radiation
levels briefly increased to 46 microroentgens an hour which is
twice the natural radiation level.
	   Unit Two is undergoing repairs and there has been no breach of
radiation protection norms, the press release says.
	   The failure occurred in one of the four 440-megawatt units of
the plant.
	   The Kozlodui plant, located 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of
Sofia, has four 440-megawatt pressurized water units, without
safety encasement that were brought in line between 1974 and 1982.
	   Two newer 1,000-megawatt units with encasement were installed in
1987 and 1989.
	   The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency has long
described the four older units as a safety risk.
	   Bulgaria has invested over dlrs 100 million to upgrade the
reactors' safety systems and refused calls from the West to close
them down.
	   The plant provides some 40 percent of the country's electricity.

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ In technology-crazy Finland, even the
bugs are bugged.
	   In an experiment in Kerava, a town near Helsinki, scientists
have strapped tiny transmitters to beetles to monitor their
movements in a disused field.
	   The scientists tune in to the transmitters, which weigh less
than a half-gram (0.0175 ounces), each morning to see where the
beetles are. By monitoring their movements, ``We want to see how
the beetles move to find clues on ways to improve urban
environments for all living things, including humans,'' Jari
Niemela, from the University of Helsinki, said Thursday.
	   The results of the 10-day experiment will be published as part
of a larger ecological project charting plants, insects and nature
in Kerava, a town of 30,000.
	   Finns are famously enthusiastic about electronics, and have the
world's highest percentage of cellular phone users _ 42 of every
100 people in the country carry one, according to the World Bank.
	   It's unlikely beetles would be quite so enthusiastic _ the
transmitters used in the experiment are about half the weight of
the insects themselves.
	   But Niemela said that earlier experiments indicated their
movements were not hampered in any significant way.
	   Since the project began on July 10, Niemela's team has lost
track of two beetles, possibly because of power cuts in the
transmitters.
	   ``I don't think the insects have gone off in a huff. We gave
them a good rest and extra food before the experiment began,''
Niemela said. ``It could be dead batteries or maybe they just
headed off across the car park or street nearby.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with President Alberto Fujimori's reaction to pullout
 &UR; Shell cancels massive gas project in jungle, rocking Peru's
economy &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID KOOP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Royal-Dutch Shell has said it will pull out of
the massive Camisea gas fields project in the Amazon rain forest,
rocking one of the pillars of Peru's planned economic development.
	   Shell said Wednesday night it would not continue with the dlrs 3
billion project, the largest natural resource investment in Peru's
history, because it wanted greater control over the sale and
marketing of the natural gas.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant was the operator in a partnership with
Mobil Oil, based in Fairfax, Virginia.
	   ``In spite of efforts by Shell and Mobil to overcome differences
with authorities over the introduction of gas into the Peruvian
market, a solution could not be found,'' said a brief news release
from Shell. It did not give further reasons for the pull out.
	   The three Camisea gas fields, located 350 miles (550 kms)
southeast of Lima amid some of the world's most biodiverse jungle,
are the largest gas reserves in the Americas, estimated to contain
more than 11 trillion (310 billion cubic meters) cubic feet of
natural gas and 600 million barrels of condensates.
	   President Alberto Fujimori on Thursday called Shell's decision
``lamentable,'' but said Peru would seek new companies to develop
the fields.
	   ``The development of Camisea won't be halted, delayed or
canceled,'' Fujimori said of the project he hopes will end the
nation's dependence on imported oil.
	   Fujimori said the negotiations with Shell broke down in part
over estimated cost, which had risen to dlrs 4 billion from dlrs 3
billion, making it less profitable.
	   Shell estimated it would have started producing gas in 2001 and
brought Peru more than dlrs 8 billion over the next 10 years in tax
revenues, wages and investment. It was to have produced gas for 40
years.
	   Large investments in fishing, cement and petrochemicals were
expected to pour into Peru on the back of Camisea.
	   Fujimori even traveled to England earlier this month to meet
with top Shell officials to try to sway their decision.
	   ``This is a major blow to Peru's economy. The anticipated income
from Camisea formed a part of how Peruvian authorities planned to
meet their foreign debt obligations,'' said oil and gas analyst
Daniel Saba.
	   Analysts said Shell's pullout may leave other companies leary of
taking over.
	   ``Clearly, the initial impact of Shell's decision is huge, but
Peru now will start looking for alternatives,'' said Manuel
Barrantes, former president of state oil company Petroperu.
	   Sensitive to its public relations disaster in Nigeria, where it
has been accused of destroying the environment and ignoring human
rights abuses, Shell had planned to make its Camisea operations a
model of ecologically sensitive drilling.
	   Shell and Mobil Oil signed a deal with Peru to develop Camisea
in 1996 with the option to pull out before 1998 if their evaluation
of fields' economic feasibility proved negative. The companies
spent dlrs 250 million drilling exploratory wells and building
camps.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Thousands of Russians stood in
silence along St. Petersburg's grand streets and river embankments
Thursday, watching in solemn tribute as their last emperor returned
home.
	   A long line of dark green hearses glided past the imperial
capital's canals and palaces, saluted by cannon and honor guards as
they carried the remains of Czar Nicholas II and his murdered
family to the cathedral where they will be buried Friday.
	   ``We're watching history, the history of Russia,'' said
Alexandra Butina, 16, who brought her 9-year-old brother Semyon to
watch the cortege drive through the gates of the city's central
fortress.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution, the
Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and repentance.
	   President Boris Yeltsin, who previously tried to stay out of the
fray, abruptly changed his mind Thursday and announced that he
would attend Friday's requiem and burial ceremony.
	   ``The truth was concealed for 80 years,'' Yeltsin said.
``Nothing was said about it. And tomorrow, the truth should be
told, and I should take part.''
	   Lyuba Novikova, a 37-year-old secretary, said she was surprised
by the depth of emotion she felt when she saw the hearses appear
over the arch of the Troitsky Bridge.
	   ``I cried,'' she said. ``I'm a simple person. I can't say why,
but I cried.''
	   But then she gave it another thought and added: ``It's like a
shadow has been over us, and now we hope things will be better for
Russia.''
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for 300 years. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
his wife, Alexandra, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nine of the 11 bodies
were recovered from a desolate forest outside the Ural Mountains
city of Yekaterinburg and subjected to years of painstaking tests
to confirm their identification.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, when the
bones were taken from the city's police morgue and placed in small,
skeleton-sized coffins. On Thursday morning, they were taken to a
hilltop church for a three-hour public service.
	   Hundreds of Russians knelt to pray, and some wept, as they
viewed coffins at the Ascension of the Lord Church.
	   ``I have come to pay a last tribute to the innocent victims,''
said a tearful Vera Kolchina, 74. ``Their deaths were a tragic part
of our history.''
	   The coffins were then loaded into plain white vans and driven to
the Yekaterinburg airport. They were flown to St. Petersburg aboard
an Aeroflot cargo jet, met by an honor guard and borne to the
cortege for the procession through the stately streets of the old
capital.
	   The procession moved briskly until it reached the Winter Palace,
the czar's official residence. It then slowed to a regal gait, as
if to give the royal family one last glimpse of home.
	   The events will culminate in Friday's requiem, which will be
recited in Orthodox churches throughout the country.
	   But the actual burial ceremony in St. Petersburg's Peter and
Paul Cathedral will be relatively simple. The church, torn by
internal conflicts, has not yet recognized the bones as belonging
to the royal family. And so when they are interred, the priest will
not use the names of the deceased, even though their name plaques
are already hanging on the walls of the chapel.
	   ``I don't think the church is right,'' said Yuri Basiliyev, a
30-year-old history student. ``Their decision is a political
action. ... They don't want to give this government their
legitimacy.''

Military exercises begin off Baltic coast

<TEXT>
	   KLAIPEDA, Lithuania (AP) _ Thousands of troops are taking part
in joint military maneuvers under NATO's Partnership for Peace that
got underway off Lithuania's coast.
	   Lithuanian Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius, in a speech
opening the Baltic Challenge '98 maneuvers, said ``these exercises
will only strengthen military trust in the region.''
	   But they also come amid tension between Russia and the three
former Soviet Baltic republics over their determination to join
NATO. Russia has offered security guarantees to Lithuania, Latvia
and Estonia if they agree to stop seeking membership in the Western
alliance, but the offer has been rejected.
	   Russia, although a PFP member and with a huge naval base in the
Kaliningrad enclave just south of Lithuania, is not among the 11
countries participating in the exercises.
	   Besides the three Baltics, the countries involved ar the United
States, Poland, Germany, Hungary, Denmark, Sweden, Norway and
Finland. A total of about 5,000 troops are in the exercise, some
2,000 of them American.
	   The exercises, which end on July 25, are meant to increased
preparedness for possible joint peacekeeping missions, organizers
said.
	   Among those taking part are five American-trained dolphins used
for locating underwater mines. It is the first time such dolphins
have been used in Europe.
	   At the opening ceremonies, U.S. Ambassador to Lithuania Keith
Smith reiterated the American view that expanding NATO would be
good for all countries in the region.
	   ``One of the biggest difficulties is convincing people that
everybody can win with NATO (expansion),'' he said.
	   There was no direct link to the exercises and NATO membership
for the Baltics, but the maneuvers are likely to make the Baltics'
militaries more sophisticated, improving their chances for NATO
membership.
	   ``These exercises will help us greatly in reaching our goal of
getting into NATO,'' said Estonian government spokesman Daniel
Vaarik. ``Because, as NATO itself has said, it's not weapons we
need so much, but improving our communication and cooperation
skills.''

Woods in hunt as British Open begins

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lead; UPDATES scores &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Tiger's back, at least for a day.
	   Tiger Woods grabbed the lead in a major tournament Thursday for
the first time since winning the Masters, shooting a 5-under 65 to
tie John Huston atop a British Open leaderboard sprinkled with big
names.
	   Woods, using a new putter on the advice of his friend, Mark
O'Meara, took advantage of his length and a deft touch around the
greens on a warm and nearly windless day that left Royal Birkdale
at its most friendly.
	   Just behind Woods were winners of other majors, with Fred
Couples and Nick Price a stroke back at 66. Loren Roberts was 4
under after 17, while Davis Love III led a group of four golfers
who finished the first round at 3 under.
	   Woods, looking to contend in a major for the first time since
his 1997 Masters win, nearly drove the 411-yard (375-meter) ninth
hole and reached the only two par-5s on the course with irons on
his second shot. But the putter, which has betrayed him recently,
may have been the key on the surprisingly tame Birkdale links.
	   Woods would have had the early lead to himself, but his 5-foot
(1 1/2-meter) par putt on the final hole hit the left lip and
kicked out. It was a rare mistake on a day where he made seven
birdies against two bogeys.
	   The score was a stroke off the 64 Woods shot last year at Royal
Troon. But that came in the third round after he had shot himself
out of contention; he finished in a tie for 24th.
	   ``This was very similar to the third round at Troon but this
time I putted better,'' Woods said. ``I made a couple of bombs
which felt really good.''
	   Woods, who made four birdie putts within 12 feet (3 1/2 meters)
on the front side, sank a curling 35-footer (10 1/2-meter) on the
13th hole to offset a bogey a hole earlier. He then birdied the
par-5 15th and 17th holes before closing with the bogey 5.
	   With half the field still out on a course that played much
simpler than expected because of the fair weather, Woods and Huston
were a shot better than Price, who won the 1994 Open.
	   Another shot back at 67 were Brad Faxon and Sweden's Fredrik
Jacobson, while 10 other golfers also finished under par midway
through the first day.
	   Still out on the course was Couples, who was 4-under through 16,
and still had the reachable par-5 17th to play.
	   The weather was in stark contrast to conditions in practice this
week when the wind howled and players grumbled that no one might
break par for the championship. And it was enjoyed with a close eye
kept on the forecast for increased winds and rain on Friday.
	   ``As the sun broke through, it was almost perfect,'' Woods said.
``We might even get some people with heat stroke out here.''
	   Woods was almost perfect himself on the front side, taking
advantage of light winds and soft greens that tamed the links on
the Irish Sea. He moved into the lead with a 3-foot (1-meter)
birdie after chipping to the ninth green, and had three more
birdies on the back nine.
	   At the par-3 12th, Woods misclubbed and hit the ball over the
green. He chipped to within 2-feet (1 1/2-meter), but lipped out
his par putt.
	   Woods, whose putter kept him from contending in the U.S. Open
and the Masters this year, hasn't won a major since the 1997
Masters and has won only once on the PGA Tour this year, in the
BellSouth Classic.
	   But he insisted coming into the Open that he was striking the
ball well, and he showed it with some long drives and precise irons
before a massive gallery that cheered every shot.
	   Jacobson, playing in the first group of the day, used an eagle
on the par-5 17th to take the early clubhouse lead.
	   It didn't last long, though, as Huston made a 40-footer
(12-meter) for eagle on the 17th hole. He then hit a spectacular
shot out of the deep rough on the final hole that hopped up on the
green and rolled to within 3-feet (1-meter) for a finishing birdie
and a 5-under 65.
	   Huston, who had to use a special career money winning exemption
to play on the PGA tour this year, credited magnets in his bed and
in the insole of his shoes for helping relieve tendinitis and
bursitis and allow him to play nearly pain-free again.
	   ``Last year, pretty much every day I would get up and wouldn't
feel very strong, kind of achey,'' Huston said. ``I didn't look
forward to going to the golf course, and it showed.''
	   While Huston was having his best day in five Opens, it was Woods
who thrilled the crowd on a day when overcast skies and little wind
helped the field throw high iron shots at the pins without fear of
the tall meadow rye rough.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, meanwhile, teased his fans with
two early birdies but may have shot himself out of yet another Open
in the first round with a 40 on the back for a 3-over 73.
	   England's Lee Westwood, who along with David Duval had been one
of the young favorites, also got off to a shaky start with two
bogeys on the front nine. Westwood had to birdie the 16th and 17th
to finish at 1-over 71, while Duval finished his round at even-par
70.
	   Neither Duval nor Westwood has won a major, but both have been
dominant players in the last year. Westwood in particular is on a
roll, having won seven times on four continents in the last nine
months, including three of his last four tournaments.
	   ``As soon as the putts start going in I think I will be making a
move in the right direction,'' Westwood said.
	   Woods, of course, already has his win in a major, and is seeking
his second at the young age of 22. And he also has the length to
contend at the 7,018-yard (6,415-meter) Birkdale, where the winds
can play havoc with scores. He not only hits it long, but has the
power to rip the ball out of the deep meadow rye that has
encroached even further on the fairways than the last time the Open
was here in 1991.
	   ``I think I have a chance in each and every major,'' Woods said
earlier. ``You've got to be hitting on all cylinders in order to
win. Every facet of your game has to be good in order to win a
major.''
	   Tom Lehman, who won in 1996, had a late tee time but still
played despite injuring his right shoulder at a local amusement
park on Tuesday. Lehman was even par through nine holes.
	   Fred Couples birdied the first hole of his round and was 2-under
after 11, while Davis Love III was also at 3-under after 16 holes.
	   No matter who contends this week, the eighth Open held in this
town on the Irish Sea will mark the passing of an era.
	   Jack Nicklaus made sure of that when he announced earlier this
month that he would skip Birkdale, ending his remarkable streak of
major tournaments at 146.

South African star goes home for treatment to ankle injury
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DURHAM, England (AP) _ South African all-rounder Lance Klusener
is out of the fourth test against England and will fly home for
treatment to an injured ankle.
	   The 26-year-old suffered the injury to his left ankle as his
foot repeatedly landed in the bowlers' footholes during the last
test. Despite X-rays and scans, no cure has been found for his
condition.
	   He played in both one-day matches in Ireland last week but was
left out of the drawn match against Durham to allow him some rest.
	   Klusener was put through a fitness test in the nets at the
Riverside ground Thursday but called it off after a few deliveries
and team physiotherapist Craig Smith organized his return home to
seek specialist advice.
	   ``Lance has had another X-ray but it hasn't healed completely so
we are sending him home to South Africa so he can see a specialist
who has treated him in the past,'' said coach Bob Woolmer, whose
team leads the series 1-0.
	   ``We don't know what the problem is but we are still hopeful he
can take some part in the rest of the tour although we are a week
away from taking any definite decisions about anything.''
	   Captain Hansie Cronje said Klusener was ``distraught'' about
having to miss part of the tour.
	   ``It's always disappointing to lose a key player,'' he said.
``But, when we started 22 months virtually non-stop cricket last
September, we knew this sort of thing could happen.''

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with DiCaprio publicist calling interview a
fabrication, trims &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio was quoted in
Britain's Eva magazine as saying he finds kissing ``disgusting,''
but one of his publicists said the interview was based on a
fabrication and demanded a retraction.
	   ``When you think about it, kissing is pretty disgusting,'' the
23-year-old ``Titanic'' star was quoted as saying. ``The human
mouth is one of the dirtiest things on this planet. There's so much
bacteria, slime and trapped food _ a dog's mouth is much cleaner.''
	   But publicist Deborah Grimes in Los Angeles said DiCaprio never
gave an interview to the magazine.
	   No one was available to respond to Grimes' comments at the
magazine's offices Thursday evening. Eva's editor, Terry Tavner,
did not immediately return a call left on a home answering machine.
	   DiCaprio was quoted in the magazine that many women offer him
sexual favors, but said he prefers pursuing the type who ``won't
even give you a second glance.''
	   Eva also quoted him as saying he has yet to find ``absolute
love'' and will not settle down until he does.

	   CHATEAUROUX, France (AP) - A quick look at Thursday's stage of
the 85th Tour de France.
	   STAGE: Thursday's fifth stage was from Cholet to Chateauroux,
228 kilometers (127 miles), moving slightly eastward towards the
center of the country.
	   WINNER: Mario Cipollini of Italy in a final sprint over another
top finisher, Erik Zabel of Germany.
	   YELLOW JERSEY: Stuart O'Grady of Australia held on to the lead
for the second day in a row and should hold it until Saturday's
time trial. He had a 7-seven advantage of American George Hincapie.
	   HOW THE OTHERS FARED: Last year's Tour champ, Germany's Jan
Ullrich, finished in the main pack and is 22nd overall at 1 minute,
22 seconds behind. Telekom teammate Erik Zabel moved up to ninth,
45 seconds back with the help of bonus seconds along the way and at
the finish. Bjarne Riis, the 1996 Tour winner from Denmark is 31st,
1:29 back.
	   TOUR TIDBIT: Cipollini won his seventh stage of the Tour de
France. He had fallen once and was held up by a crash in two other
stages but finally he was able to unleash his powerful sprint.
	   QUOTE OF THE DAY: ``He is suspended provisionally, effective
immediately.'' Decision taken by the International Cycling Union on
Festina team director Bruno Roussel.
	   THE NEXT STAGE: The sixth stage from La Chatre to
Brive-la-Gaillarde, 204 kilometers (142 miles), the last stage
before the first time trial on Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A Romanian businessman was shot in his
car by unidentified persons while he was returning, police reported
Thursday.
	   Mihai Ionescu, 48, died in hospital Wednesday about an hour
after he was shot three times in his chest. He owned an
import-export firm and allegedly had ties with underworld figures.
	   The spokesman for the Bucharest police, Col. Dumitru Secrieru,
declined to speculate on Ionescu's death saying that police had
opened an investigation.
	   Ionescu was expected in front of his villa by four persons in a
black Mercedes with a German license tag, the news agency Mediafax
reported quoting witnesses.
	   Unlike Bulgaria or Russia, mafia-type killings are rare in
Romania.

Turkmen leader says he wants money from Russia, not goods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leader of Turkmenistan complained Thursday
that Russia was trying to repay a debt to the Central Asian nation
in goods, rather than money, a news agency reported.
	   The Turkmen leader, Saparmurat Niyazov, said Moscow had proposed
paying 70 percent of the dlrs 107 million debt in Russian goods. He
called the offer ``unacceptable, given today's situation in
Turkmenistan's economy,'' ITAR-Tass said.
	   Niyazov said Turkmenistan ``needs hard currency as never
before.''
	   The same could be said of Russia, which is in the midst of
negotiating a huge financial bailout with international lenders.
Russian workers have become used to getting paid in merchandise,
and many deals in Russian business are conducted on a barter basis.
	   The report did not say what kinds of goods Russia was offering
Turkmenistan.

Paramilitary groups likely to meet decommissioning date, official

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The man supervising the
handover of terrorist weapons as part of Northern Ireland's peace
agreement said Thursday that he believed paramilitary groups would
meet the May 2000 decommissioning target date listed in the accord.
	   ``Our perspective is that it is going to happen and, we feel,
sooner rather than later,'' Canada Gen. Jean de Chastelain told BBC
Radio Ulster.
	   De Chastelain said he would like to see some weapons handed over
before the new Belfast Assembly reconvenes Sept. 14.
	   ``If it goes well into next year and we have nothing, it will be
difficult for politicians to accept that there is good will on the
part of the paramilitaries,'' he said.
	   Last month, the commander of Irish Republican Army prisoners in
the Maze prison, Padraic Wilson, told The Financial Times he was
hopeful decommissioning would take place ``once we get a sense that
the arrangements envisaged in the agreement are beginning to
function.''
	   Also Thursday, police investigating the firebombing deaths of
three young brothers killed in Ballymoney, about 40 miles (65 kms)
northwest of Belfast, announced a ``small number'' of further
arrests.
	   The suspects join one man detained after the Sunday morning
arson attack that took the lives of Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn.
Another was released without charge Wednesday.
	   Detectives provided no further details about the new arrests.
	   The killing of the Quinn brothers, which came after a week of
violent demonstrations, undermined a campaign by the Protestant
Orange Order to make a prohibited march through a Catholic area of
Portadown, 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Belfast.
	   Hard-line members of the Protestant fraternal order, determined
to stay at Drumcree Anglican church until they are permitted to
march, stood by Thursday while police searched again for explosives
and firearms.
	   A search on Wednesday recovered explosives and a submachine gun
from fields near the church, underlining the order's inability to
control its violent allies. Police arrested more than 20 people,
and four were charged with offenses including riotous behavior and
possessing a bomb.
	   Police said only eight representatives of the Portadown Orange
lodges would be allowed in while the search continued, and that
numbers would have to be strictly controlled afterward.
	   The Orange Order had been protesting since July 5, when police
and soldiers enforced a government order barring the march.

Seven policemen arrested for involvement in drug smuggling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Seven policemen were arrested Thursday
for alleged involvement in international drug trafficking, the
Interior Ministry said.
	   The statement came two days after police reported a crackdown on
a gang of Bulgarian and Turkish drug smugglers. They arrested two
brothers _ Mehmet Said and Ridvan Said _ both Turks. They will be
deported, the statement said.
	   According to the Interior Ministry, the seven policemen were
bribed by the drug dealers to allow them to operate in Bulgaria.
	   Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev, whose office is trying to fight
official corruption as well as organized crime, said the policemen
would be fired and prosecuted.
	   Drug smuggling has increased in Bulgaria and across the former
Soviet bloc since border restrictions eased after the collapse of
communism in 1989. Collaboration of police and customs officers is
widely believed to help the illegal trade.
	   Favorite routes run from Turkey across Bulgaria, Romania and
Macedonia to western Europe.

Final results from Ecuador vote delayed; Quito mayor ahead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ With vote records still coming in from
several remote districts, election authorities said Thursday the
final results from Ecuador's disputed presidential runoff may be
delayed until next week.
	   Sunday's vote was apparently won by Jamil Mahuad, the
Harvard-educated mayor of Quito who has promised to fight
corruption and bring political stability to this chronically
chaotic Andean nation of 12 million.
	   With more than 99 percent of the vote counted, Mahuad had 51
percent and banana tycoon rival Alvaro Noboa had 49 percent,
according to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.
	   Election officials have not yet declared Mahuad the winner. A
tribunal spokesman said results will not be official until they are
announced.
	   ``It will not be possible to submit the final results because
some offices in the provinces of Sucumbios and Guayas still have
not handed in their final lists,'' said Eduardo Villaquiran, vice
president of the tribunal.
	   Ecuadoreans have waited anxiously for four days for the final
vote results. Both candidates have claimed victory based on exit
polls, and Noboa has refused to concede, charging that the vote was
riddled with fraud.
	   Noboa, Ecuador's richest man, accused election officials of
awarding blank ballots to Mahuad and marking ballots in his favor
as spoiled. He has offered to pay the salaries of election workers
to recount the votes one by one.
	   ``We know that the candidate Alvaro Noboa is going to challenge
these elections,'' Villaquiran said.
	   In Noboa's home town of Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, his
supporters clashed with police guarding the vote counting center on
Wednesday night. No injuries or arrest were reported.
	   Foreign observers have rejected fraud charges, pronouncing the
election clean.
	   Mahuad, 48, and Noboa, 47, were the top vote-getters in the
first round of voting on May 31.
	   The winner will take over a nation with its democracy and
economy in tatters. The economy is expected to grow by no more than
1 percent in 1998, battered by El Nino-driven floods and mudslides
and falling prices for its main export, oil.

 &UR; Jewish groups denounce Assad for allegedly harboring war criminal &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Families of victims of the Holocaust demonstrated
Thursday in front of the Syrian Embassy, protesting the state visit
of President Hafez Assad for allegedly harboring war criminal Alois
Brunner.
	   ``Shame to Assad Who Protects the Nazi Criminal Brunner'' read a
banner at the peaceful protest.
	   The demonstration was organized by several groups including the
Sons and Daughters of the Deported Jews of France, created by noted
Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld.
	   Klarsfeld is among those convinced that Brunner, now 87, lives
in Syria under the alias Goerg Fischer.
	   ``He can't leave Syria. He's an old man,'' Klarsfeld said in a
telephone interview this week. ``He is of no interest to any
country.''
	   Brunner, blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece, was placed under formal investigation
for crimes against humanity in 1988, after Klarsfeld's group filed
suit.
	   An investigating magistrate has since sought permission to go to
Syria to pursue his inquiry.
	   Permission has not been granted, and Assad has remained silent
to all demands.
	   Klarsfeld said he had assurances from President Jacques Chirac
that he personally asked Assad about Brunner during his 1996 visit
to Damascus.
	   The Union of Jewish Students in France said Thursday the group
had been assured by a presidential adviser that Chirac would again
broach the issue in talks with Assad.
	   In a French television interview conducted this week and aired
Wednesday, the Syrian leader denied any knowledge of Brunner's
whereabouts.
	   ``If you know where he is, go immediately to his address to find
out whether or not he is there,'' Assad told TF1.
	   The arrival of Assad fell on the 56th anniversary of the ``Vel
d'Hiv roundup,'' named for a Paris cycling stadium where 13,152
Jews were detained July 16-17, 1942, by French police before being
sent to Nazi death camps. It was one of the worst acts of French
collaboration with the Nazi occupiers.

U.N. panel concerned about Israeli practices

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Israel's detention of Palestinian prisoners
without charge or trial presents major human-rights problems, a
U.N. panel of experts said Thursday.
	   The Human Rights Committee said it is concerned about Israeli
discrimination against Palestinians in Israel and in occupied
areas.
	   Israeli officials said its measures were needed for national
security and that the controversial practice of administrative
detention applies to Jews as well.
	   Members of the panel said Israel's use of emergency powers
should be independently reviewed and that the country should adopt
a bill of rights.
	   The committee of 18 independent human-rights experts was
examining Israel's first report on its implementation of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which it
ratified in 1991.
	   It also said Israel's application of different standards on
freedom of movement discriminated against Palestinians.
	   Committee members and human rights groups criticized the Israeli
government for failing to include in its report details about the
human rights situation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   Human rights groups had urged the committee to take the country
to task on a range of issues including the killings of Palestinians
by Israeli troops, Israel's use of physical force in interrogations
of Palestinian suspects, the arbitrary detention of dozens of
prisoners without charge or trial, and ``unfair'' trials of
Palestinians in Israeli military courts.
	   Christine Chanet of France, who chairs the committee, said at
the end of the two-day session that the committee had considered as
particular problems Israel's practices in the occupied territories.
	   Different standards for the movement of Palestinians and Jews
amount to discrimination, Chanet said.
	   Israeli officials said there is an internal review system to
ensure the country lives up to its international obligations.
Individuals with complaints against the country's authorities have
redress through Israel's judicial system, they said.
	   They said the extraordinary measures had to be taken when the
existence of Israel or the security of its people are threatened by
terrorist operations.
	   Chanet said the committee rejected that argument.
	   ``That is their position, security,'' she said. ``We say, no,
you have no justification for discrimination.''
	   She said the government would have to respect all the guidelines
in the convention in order to be able to claim it was upholding it.
	   The committee, which periodically reviews the reports of each of
some 140 governments who have ratified the accord, will publish its
full conclusions on Israel July 31.
	   The Association of Civil Rights in Israel claimed the Israeli
officials ``avoided answering difficult issues'' put to it by the
committee.
	   ``We didn't always feel they were completely up front,'' said
spokeswoman Hadas Tagari.

Moya will head Spain's Davis cup squad against Switzerland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   A CORUNA, Spain (AP) _ Spain's Davis Cup Squad will be looking
for its first semifinal in 11 years when playing Switzerland this
weekend. The team will be led by Carlos Moya, the world's
fourth-ranked player.
	   Moya, the reigning champion of Roland Garros and the Montecarlo
Open was drawn Thursday to face Swiss Ivo Heuberger in the first
singles match Friday. Alex Corretja, who is ranked seventh, will
play against Marc Rosset.
	   Moya will take on Rosset in the reverse singles Sunday.
	   Spaniards Julian Alonso and Javier Sanchez Vicario will team up
in doubles Saturday against Rosset and Lorenzo Manta of
Switzerland. Switzerland advanced with a victory over Czech
Republic while Spain eliminated Brazil.
	   The winner of the match will face the winner of the duel between
Germany and the defending champion, Sweden.

Government urges Sierra Leone rebels to surrender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ Sierra Leone's government appealed
Thursday to a throng of 5,000 surrendered members of the country's
deposed military junta to pressure their defiant comrades to put
down their arms and end fighting in rural areas.
	   Internal Affairs Minister Charles Margai told the disbanded
rebels at a military base outside the capital of this West African
country that the government was offering food and medical supplies
to renegades who agree surrender their weapons and live in
government-monitored camps.
	   ``Your future is in your own hands and the government is ready
to accept you into society but everything depends on your attitude
to the civilian population,'' Margai said.
	   He was referring to ongoing attacks against villagers by rebels
seeking revenge for their ouster from power in February by a
Nigerian-led West African intervention force.
	   The West African force, known as ECOMOG, is fighting on behalf
of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah who was overthrown in a military
coup in May 1997, but restored to power 10 months later.
	   Margai was accompanied by a large delegation of Sierra Leonean
and U.N. officials, along with the Nigerian commander of the
intervention force, Gen. Timothy Shelpidi.
	   At least 750 people have died of hunger and disease over the
past few months in Massingbi, about 120 kilometers (75 miles) east
of the capital of Freetown after fleeing fighting, a United Nations
aid official said Tuesday. He said thousands more are in danger
from measles, malnutrition and diarrhea.

Maldini's future to be decided by end of July
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Cesare Maldini may soon become the latest coach
sacked in the wake of a World Cup failure.
	   Luciano Nizzola, president of the Italian soccer Federation,
said Thursday that Maldini's replacement, if ever decided, would be
discussed by the end of July.
	   ``It's something which will be decided during the next meeting
of the Federal Council on July 30,'' Nizzola told reporters.
	   Italy's elimination by France following a penalty shootout in
the World Cup quarterfinals was considered a disappointing result
for the Azzurri, originally rated among the top title contenders.
	   According to published reports Dino Zoff, a former national team
goalie and coach of Juventus and Lazio, was prepared to take over
Maldini's post beginning with the European qualifying match with
Wales in September.

After storm over Dutch drug policy, U.S. drug czar visits
</HEADLINE>
Amsterdam &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey
flew into the eye of a self-made storm today as he arrived to study
the permissive Dutch narcotics policy he has already branded an
``unmitigated disaster.''
	   His harsh criticism of the Dutch policy prompted officials here
to question the value of his mission, which in effect pits
America's zero-tolerance approach to drugs with the laissez-faire
Dutch policy.
	   From the corridors of Dutch government buildings where
retaliatory statements were issued, to funky coffee shops where
hashish and marijuana are sold over the counter, the retired
four-star general has generated a buzz.
	   ``It's easy to point the finger at others when you have a
problem at home,'' said Anouke Scholten at Amsterdam's Coffeeshop
36, referring to U.S. officials' long-fought battle against
narcotics.
	   ``He (McCaffrey) has to come to our coffee shop and look around.
The atmosphere is good and there is no violence,'' added Scholten.
	   But there's no chance of that happening.
	   After arriving in Amsterdam, McCaffrey was hurled into a day
packed with activities. The plans ranged from presentations on the
Netherlands' latest state-funded heroin handout experiment to
techniques used by customs authorities in the world's largest port,
Rotterdam, to intercept international drug shipments.
	   McCaffrey was to see just about every aspect of the Dutch policy
at work, except a coffee shop _ the officially tolerated cafes that
sell hashish and marijuana.
	   Although technically illegal, small amounts of soft drugs like
hashish and marijuana are ubiquitous in cafes. Hard drugs like
cocaine and heroin also are cheap and easily available. Law
enforcement agencies claim it is better to spend money trying to
battle international drug smuggling than trying to break up the
street-level trade.
	   The U.S. drug czar's visit comes as two Dutch marines involved
in drug-interdiction in the Caribbean have been arrested for
allegedly trying to smuggle almost 800 pounds of cocaine to the
Netherlands. A third marine was questioned but released. Seven
civilians and four military personnel from the Netherlands Antilles
also have been detained in the case.
	   Some of the drugs were found aboard a Dutch navy plane that
patrols the Caribbean for drug trafficking as part of the
Netherlands Antilles coast guard.
	   As well as the ``unmitigated disaster'' comment, McCaffrey this
week claimed that the Dutch murder rate is twice as high as that in
the United States because of the tolerant Dutch drug policy.
	   The Dutch angrily publicized statistics refuting McCaffrey's
claims and stood by their often-criticized policy.
	   ``We have our own policy and we think it works,'' said Health
Ministry spokesman Benno Bruggink. ``We don't tell people that it
is the one and only solution.''

Israeli businessman sentenced to 16 years for sales to Iran

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The justice ministry announced Thursday
that it will look into allegations of misconduct in a high profile
treason trial rife with scandal.
	   The proceedings were tainted by defense charges that the judge
had secretly maintained a ``close, intensive'' relationship with a
female member of the defense team and discussed the case with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu has vehemently denied the charges. On Thursday, he
accused opposition legislators who had first raised the
allegations, of waging a political smear campaign against him.
	   The preliminary investigation was announced hours after Nahum
Manbar, convicted of treason, was sentenced to 16 years in jail for
selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   Manbar's attorney Amnon Zichroni alleged Tuesday that Judge
Amnon Straschnov had an intimate relationship with Pninat Yanai, a
former member of his defense team who is also a friend of
Netanyahu's spokesman.
	   Yanai, however countered the charges which she said were made up
by a jilted ex-boyfriend eager to get her back. She also said that
Zichroni tried to used her friendship with Straschnov to help his
client's case.
	   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit Shemesh told The Associated
Press that Attorney General Elkyakim Rubinstein asked the police to
begin a ``preliminary investigation into all allegations
surrounding the trial.''
	   Straschnov has denied all the allegations and rejected a request
by Zichroni to withdraw from the case before passing sentence.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Manbar's conviction and sentence.
Despite his earlier charges against the judge, Zichroni was evasive
Thursday when asked whether he would make alleged improper judicial
conduct a key element of his appeal.
	   The trail was held behind closed doors and all of the testimony
is classified.
	   The justice ministry said it was not yet clear who police would
question in the investigation. Last year, Netanyahu was questioned
by police investigating a government influence-peddling scandal.
	   At Tel Aviv's District Court Thursday, Straschnov said Manbar
sacrificed Israel's security ``on the altar of unfettered greed.''
Iran is one of Israel's most implacable foes.
	   Shortly after sentencing, Netanyahu said he was pleased with the
verdict, saying Manbar had committed ``heinous crimes'' by
supplying Iran with material ``to rain down chemical death on
Israel's cities _ on our citizens and children.''
	   Manbar, who faced life in prison, sat stone-faced as he heard
the decision. When he was walked out of the court Manbar shouted:
``There will be an appeal.''
	   Manbar maintained that his business with Iran was sanctioned by
Israel's intelligence community. Yossi Melman, a journalist for the
Haaretz newspaper said that Manbar was not alone in doing business
with Iran, adding that in the early 1990s, Israeli companies sold
mortar shells and fertilizer with the knowledge of the security
establishment.
	   Netanyahu was criticized after Manbar's conviction last month
for saying he hoped the court would issue a stiff sentence.
	   Nissim Zvili, a legislator from the opposition Labor Party,
called Tuesday for an investigation of allegations that Netanyahu
had discussed the case with Straschnov and tried to influence him.
Zvili has since withdrawn the demand, saying he accepted the
judge's denial.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday accused the opposition of taking advantage
of the Manbar affair to raise ``baseless claims'' in order to
defame him and the integrity of Israel's justice system.
	   ``If I ever thought there was a limit to how low my opponents
were willing to go, it turns out I was wrong,'' he said.

Drug chief says he's handed over results of Salinas probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Switzerland's anti-narcotics police chief said
Thursday he had wrapped up his investigation into bribery
allegations against the brother of former Mexican President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari.
	   ``We have a case against Raul Salinas that he got the money from
drug traffickers,'' Valentin Roschacher told The Associated Press
in an interview from his office in Bern.
	   Roschacher said the the next step is for Swiss Attorney General
Carla Del Ponte to decide whether the evidence collected over 2 1/2
years is sufficient to prosecute Raul Salinas.
	   ``We established our final report on the police level and sent
it to the attorney general's office, and now it's up to her what
she will do,'' Roschacher said.
	   Swiss court documents have said U.S. officials alleged Raul
Salinas deposited dlrs 132 million in drug-trafficking bribes in
Swiss banks.
	   He declined to comment on a report in the Miami Herald earlier
this week that witnesses interviewed by Swiss authorities in U.S.
jails had claimed the former Mexican president himself had received
drug money.
	   Roschacher said he had turned in his report to Del Ponte ``some
weeks ago'' and that Raul Salinas' defense attorneys have until the
end of July to review the documents.
	   ``After that the attorney general's office will prepare the
decision,'' he said.
	   The Swiss concern has been whether Raul Salinas had helped
launder drug money while his younger brother was president from
1988 to 1994.
	   If Del Ponte decides to prosecute, the defense attorneys will
have the right to appeal, which would immediately send the case to
the highest Swiss court, the Federal Tribunal.
	   Last April the tribunal disclosed that the U.S. authorities
alleged Raul Salinas had deposited bribes, in part from major drug
dealers, to make sure Mexican authorities allowed cocaine to pass
through Mexico into the United States.
	   Swiss authorities arrested Raul Salinas' wife, Paulina Castanon,
and her brother, Antonio Castanon, in 1995 after they allegedly
tried to withdraw money from a Geneva account of her husband.
	   The pair were released four weeks later, when Swiss authorities
said they had been cooperative and had played only a secondary role
in the overall case.
	   The Swiss initially froze some 21 bank accounts in the case, but
have subsequently freed about dlrs 1 million belonging to Castanon.
	   Raul Salinas has been imprisoned in Mexico on charges of
homicide for the 1994 murder of a political rival and illegal
enrichment.
	   Carlos Salinas, who left Mexico in early 1995, has spent most of
his self-imposed exile in Dublin, Ireland.
	   Roschacher stressed he didn't know what U.S. and Mexican
authorities are planning.
	   ``I hope they are investigating this case, too,'' he said. ``It
can't be the duty of little Switzerland to investigate all the
international cases.''

Woods in hunt as British Open begins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES scores &QL; 
 &UR; By TIM DAHLBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Tiger's back, at least for a day.
	   Tiger Woods grabbed the lead in a major tournament Thursday for
the first time since winning the Masters, shooting a 5-under 65 to
tie John Huston atop a British Open leaderboard sprinkled with big
names.
	   Woods, using a new putter on the advice of friend Mark O'Meara,
took advantage of his length and a deft touch around the greens on
a warm and nearly windless day that left Royal Birkdale at its most
friendly.
	   Just behind Woods were winners of other majors, with Fred
Couples and Nick Price a stroke back at 66. Loren Roberts joined
them there, while Davis Love III led a group of four golfers who
finished the first round at 3 under.
	   Woods, looking to contend in a major for the first time since
his 1997 Masters win, nearly drove the 411-yard (375-meter) ninth
hole and reached the only two par-5s on the course with irons on
his second shot. But the putter, which has betrayed him recently,
may have been the key on the surprisingly tame Birkdale links.
	   Woods would have had the early lead to himself, but his 5-foot
(1 1/2-meter) par putt on the final hole hit the left lip and
kicked out. It was a rare mistake on a day he made seven birdies
against two bogeys.
	   The score was a stroke off the 64 Woods shot last year at Royal
Troon. But that came in the third round after he had shot himself
out of contention; he finished in a tie for 24th.
	   ``This was very similar to the third round at Troon but this
time I putted better,'' Woods said. ``I made a couple of bombs
which felt really good.''
	   Woods, who made four birdie putts within 12 feet (3 1/2 meters)
on the front side, sank a curling 35-footer (10 1/2-meter) on the
13th hole to offset a bogey a hole earlier. He then birdied the
par-5 15th and 17th holes before closing with the bogey 5.
	   On a course that played much simpler than expected because of
the fair weather, Woods and Huston were a shot better than Price,
who won the 1994 Open.
	   Another shot back at 67 were Brad Faxon and Sweden's Fredrik
Jacobson, while 16 other golfers also finished under par for the
day. Defending champion Justin Leonard opened with a 3-over 73.
	   The weather was in stark contrast to conditions in practice this
week when the wind howled and players grumbled that no one would
break par for the championship. And it was enjoyed with a close eye
kept on the forecast for increased winds and rain on Friday.
	   ``As the sun broke through, it was almost perfect,'' Woods said.
``We might even get some people with heat stroke out here.''
	   Woods was almost perfect himself on the front side, taking
advantage of light winds and soft greens that tamed the links on
the Irish Sea. He moved into the lead with a 3-foot birdie
(1-meter) after chipping to the ninth green, and had three more
birdies on the back nine.
	   At the par-3 12th, Woods misclubbed and hit the ball over the
green. He chipped to within 2 feet(1 1/2-meter), but lipped out his
par putt.
	   Woods, whose putter kept him from contending in the U.S. Open
and the Masters this year, has won only once on the PGA Tour this
year, in the BellSouth Classic.
	   But he insisted coming into the Open that he was striking the
ball well, and he showed it with some long drives and precise irons
before a massive gallery that cheered every shot.
	   Jacobson, playing in the first group of the day, used an eagle
on the par-5 17th to take the early clubhouse lead.
	   It didn't last long, though, as Huston made a 40-footer
(12-meter) for eagle on the 17th hole. He then hit a spectacular
shot out of the deep rough on the final hole that hopped up on the
green and rolled to within 3 feet (1-meter) for a finishing birdie
and a 5-under 65.
	   Huston, who had to use a special career money winning exemption
to play on the PGA tour this year, credited magnets on his mattress
cover and in the insole of his shoes for helping relieve tendinitis
and bursitis and allow him to play nearly pain-free again.
	   ``Last year, pretty much every day I would get up and wouldn't
feel very strong, kind of achey,'' Huston said. ``I didn't look
forward to going to the golf course, and it showed.''
	   While Huston was having his best day in five Opens, it was Woods
who thrilled the crowd on a day when overcast skies and little wind
helped the field throw high iron shots at the pins without fear of
the tall meadow rye rough.
	   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, meanwhile, teased his fans with
two early birdies but may have shot himself out of yet another Open
in the first round with a 40 on the back for a 3-over 73.
	   England's Lee Westwood, who along with David Duval had been one
of the young favorites, also got off to a shaky start with two
bogeys on the front nine. Westwood had to birdie the 16th and 17th
to finish at 1-over 71, while Duval finished his round at even-par
70.
	   Neither Duval nor Westwood has won a major, but both have been
dominant players in the last year. Westwood in particular is on a
roll, having won seven times on four continents in the last nine
months, including three of his last four tournaments.
	   ``As soon as the putts start going in I think I will be making a
move in the right direction,'' Westwood said.
	   Woods, of course, already has his win in a major, and is seeking
his second at the young age of 22. And he also has the length to
contend at the 7,018-yard (6,415-meter) Birkdale, where the winds
can play havoc with scores.
	   ``I think I have a chance in each and every major,'' Woods said
earlier. ``You've got to be hitting on all cylinders in order to
win. Every facet of your game has to be good in order to win a
major.''
	   Tom Lehman, who won in 1996, had a late tee time but still
played despite injuring his right shoulder at an amusement park on
Tuesday. He finished at 1-over 71.
	   No matter who contends this week, the eighth Open held in this
town will mark the passing of an era.
	   Jack Nicklaus made sure of that when he announced earlier this
month that he would skip Birkdale, ending his remarkable streak of
major tournaments at 146.

Mother of three brothers killed in firebombings remembers her boys
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with interview with mother of three Quinn boys; edits
throughout to trim; gravesite is cq &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BARR &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The mother whose three young
boys were killed in a sectarian firebombing said through tears
Thursday that her last memory of her sons was the sound of their
shouts when she awoke to find the family home ablaze.
	   ``I woke up to smoke. The kids were in their bedroom. I heard
them and I went to them and they weren't there,'' Chrissie Quinn,
29, said in an interview to be aired Friday on GMTV. ``I shall
always remember that.''
	   Authorities say they believe the Quinn household _ located in a
staunchly Protestant housing complex in Ballymoney, about 40 miles
(65 kms) northwest of Belfast _ was targeted because the boys'
Catholic mother lived there with her Protestant boyfriend.
	   Asked if she felt guilty in any way about the deaths of Richard,
11, Mark, 10, and Jason, 9, Ms. Quinn replied, ``I do. I wish I
hadn't stayed there.''
	   She said she had no intention, however, of leaving Northern
Ireland. She nodded when asked if that was to allow her to be near
the gravesite of the three boys.
	   Her only surviving child, 12-year-old Lee, sat next to her
during the interview, which took place at the house of Ms. Quinn's
mother in Rasharkin. Lee was sleeping over at his grandmother's the
night of the firebombing.
	   Ms. Quinn noted that the family had fled to England once after
being harassed for being Catholic, but that the boys wanted to be
with their friends and she felt they would be safe, since she was
raising them as Protestants.
	   Asked her memories of the boys, she could barely get the words
out.
	   ``Richard was a devil, but he had a big heart,'' she finally
replied. ``Jason was a good wean (wee one), Mark was a good wean.
They were just boys. They were into everything, but everybody liked
them.''
	   Asked if she believed their deaths would change anything in
Northern Ireland, she said in an almost inaudible voice: ``No.''
	   Tensions spilling over from a Protestant march blocked since
July 5 near Portadown, 60 miles southwest of Ballymoney, were
blamed for the Sunday morning firebombing of the Quinn house.
	   Ms. Quinn agreed, saying of the standoff, ``It has everything to
do with it.'' Asked if she blamed members of the Protestant Orange
Order, she nodded.
	   Police investigating the boys' deaths announced a ``small
number'' of further arrests Thursday. The suspects join one man
detained earlier in the week; another was released without charge
Wednesday.
	   Detectives provided no further details about the new arrests.
	   Also Thursday, the man supervising the handover of terrorist
weapons as part of Northern Ireland's peace agreement said he
believed paramilitary groups would meet the May 2000
decommissioning target date listed in the accord.
	   ``Our perspective is that it is going to happen and, we feel,
sooner rather than later,'' Canada Gen. Jean de Chastelain told BBC
Radio Ulster.
	   De Chastelain said he would like to see some weapons handed over
before the new Belfast Assembly reconvenes Sept. 14.
	   ``If it goes well into next year and we have nothing, it will be
difficult for politicians to accept that there is good will on the
part of the paramilitaries,'' he said.
	   Last month, the commander of Irish Republican Army prisoners in
the Maze prison, Padraic Wilson, told The Financial Times he was
hopeful decommissioning would take place ``once we get a sense that
the arrangements envisaged in the agreement are beginning to
function.''

Serbian police raid ethnic Albanian headquarters

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a warning to ethnic Albanian
leaders, Serb police raided the headquarters of Kosovo's largest
Albanian party Thursday shortly after members ended the first
session of their unauthorized parliament.
	   Meanwhile, fighting between Yugoslav forces and ethnic Albanian
separatists was reported for the first time in a strategic area
south of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina.
	   Police moved into the office of the Democratic League of Kosovo,
or LDK, moments after Kosovo's self-declared parliament, meeting
for the first time, swore in party leader Ibrahim Rugova as
president. Authorities seized documents but made no arrests.
	   In a statement, police said they ``prevented an attempt to
constitute the so-called `parliament of the Republic of Kosovo,'''
whose members were elected March 22 in an unauthorized balloting.
	   Police said the local prosecutor was considering filing criminal
charges. But the timing of the raid _ after the meeting _ suggested
the government was not seriously attempting to muzzle Rugova. The
United States and the Europeans see Rugova as the Albanian
politician most capable of conducting future peace talks with the
Yugoslav government.
	   Rugova has called for independence for Kosovo, which the
Americans and Europeans oppose. Instead, they support autonomy for
Kosovo, a Serbian province where Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1.
Serbia is part of Yugoslavia.
	   Despite his support for independence, Rugova's renunciation of
violence has made him more acceptable to the United States and
Europe as a negotiating partner than the extremist Kosovo
Liberation Army.
	   Rugova's party holds 90 percent of the seats in the 120-member
assembly, because most of the 15 other Albanian parties boycotted
the March vote.
	   The LDK's secretary-general, Nekibe Kelmendi, said the fact that
the parliament convened at all was ``a historic act and the result
of a new reality in the region which the international community
will have to consider.''
	   Although Rugova has international backing, his non-violent stand
has cost him considerable support among the Albanian community _
angered by the five-month Serb crackdown on the KLA in which
hundreds have died.
	   Rugova apparently hoped that convening the parliament would
bolster his political stature, even if the Serb government never
permits it to function.
	   Outside the provincial capital, Serb sources reported new
clashes Thursday between the KLA and security forces in several
areas.
	   The Serb Media Center said a ``large group'' of Albanians
attacked a police patrol near Prizren, about 60 kilometers (40
miles) southwest of Pristina and withdrew after a two-hour
gunbattle.
	   There was no report of casualties. But the fighting was the
first reported in the Prizren area. Earlier, Serb sources reported
KLA rebels attacked a patrol late Thursday near Urosevac., about 40
kilometers (25 miles) north of Thursday's fighting.
	   One Albanian was killed, the Serb report said. Urosevac controls
the main highway between Pristina and the Macedonian capital,
Skopje, and the fighting could signal a KLA attempt to block a
major transport artery.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said Albanian fighters attacked a lead
and zinc mine 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina but
were driven off. Rebels control most of that area except for the
mine itself.
	   In their account of the mine clash, Albanian sources said police
shelled seven KLA-controlled villages in the area late Thursday but
there were no casualties.
	   The Albanian center also reported that two ethnic Albanians had
been killed in fighting in western Kosovo over the past two days.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.

suggested the government was not seriously attempting to muzzle

	   Rugova has called for independence for Kosovo, which the
Americans and Europeans oppose. Instead, they support autonomy for
Kosovo, a province of Serbia where Albanians outnumber Serbs
9-to-1. Serbia is part of Yugoslavia.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, a top aide of President
Slobodan Milosevic said the government was ready to negotiate a
peaceful settlement in Kosovo but would never accept secession.
	   The aide, Gorica Gajevic, accused the rebel Kosovo Liberation
Army of seeking ``through terrorism and banditry'' to establish
``the impossible, an independent Kosovo.''
	   Despite his support for independence, Rugova's renunciation of
violence has made him more acceptable to the United States and

gunbattle.
	   There was no report of casualties. But the fighting was the

KLA rebels attacked a patrol late Wednesday near Urosevac, about 40

	   One Albanian was killed, the Serb report said. Urosevac controls
the main highway between Pristina and the Macedonian capital,
Skopje, and the fighting could signal a KLA attempt to block a
major transport artery.
	   In reporting on the Prizren clashes, the Kosovo Information
Center, close to Rugova's party, said Serbian police set fire to
three Albanian homes near the town and that heavy gunfire could be
heard in the area.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said Albanian fighters attacked a lead
and zinc mine 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina but
were driven off. Rebels control most of that area except for the

	   Five Albanians wounded Thursday when Serb forces shelled the
village of Dobrosevac, about 15 kilometers (9 miles) west of
Pristina, the Albanians said.
	   The reports could not be independently confirmed.

France rolls out red carpet for Assad, hoping visit will pay off
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with talks lasting two hours, 40 minutes; ADDS
background to show French connection to Syria &QL; 
 &UR; APPhotos PAR106-15 &QL; 
 &UR; By ELAINE GANLEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Syria's red, white and black flag flew on the
Champs-Elysees Thursday, a sign of the red-carpet treatment France
is giving President Hafez Assad in hopes his rare visit could bring
a new dimension to the Mideast peace process.
	   But the two-day state visit -- the first here in 22 years -- was
also cause for controversy.
	   Families of Holocaust victims protested Assad's silence on the
whereabouts of accused war criminal Alois Brunner, said to be
hiding in Syria; the Committee for a Free Lebanon was demonstrating
against Syrian occupation of Lebanon; a human rights group demanded
Syria free political prisoners.
	   President Jacques Chirac greeted Assad and an entourage of five
ministers at Orly airport with a fanfare welcome of Marines and
martial music. The two then met for two hours and 40 minutes, ahead
of a state dinner at the Elysee Palace. The two leaders scheduled a
second meeting for Friday morning.
	   The high-level welcome was a sign of French hopes that Assad's
visit will pay off with improved ties and trade and, more
importantly, with new impetus to the blocked Middle East peace
process.
	   Chirac, who visited Damascus in 1996, has actively sought a
clear role for France, and Europe, in the peace process, and Assad,
who is seeking an alternative to American mediation, could provide
it.
	   France has particular leverage in the Middle East today because
of its past presence there. Syria, for instance, was a
French-mandated territory from 1920-46.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy to break the lengthy impasse. And French
intervention in the region has occasionally advanced the process
where American policy failed.
	   During Israel's offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon in 1996, France engineered a truce that still
stands. And last month, France guaranteed an exchange of prisoners
and soldiers' remains between Lebanon and Israel.
	   In May, France and Egypt jointly proposed an international
conference to save the peace process -- certain to be discussed
with Assad.
	   Syria is demanding Israel hand over the Golan Heights, seized in
1967, in exchange for peace. This is in keeping with the
land-for-peace formula that underpins the peace process.
	   ``(Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu says he wants
peace for peace, a motto which means that he wants to retain our
land and also take peace from us,'' Assad said in a television
interview aired Wednesday night by France's TF1 station.
	   Asked if Syria would withdraw from southern Lebanon if Israel
gave up the strategic Golan Heights, Assad replied: ``I don't see
the link between the two.''
	   The austere Assad, 67, last visited France in 1976, when Chirac
was prime minister. Assad has not left his region since a 1994
meeting with President Clinton in Geneva, and passions surpassing
politics were stirred by his arrival here.

for the Maiti Nepal Hostel in Katmandu, Nepal, which he visited in
February.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a warning to ethnic Albanian
leaders, Serb police raided the headquarters of Kosovo's largest
Albanian party Thursday while fighting was reported for the first
time in a strategic area south of this provincial capital.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
raid was ``emblematic of the repressive nature'' of Yugoslav rule
in Kosovo ``which sparked the current crisis'' in the rebellious
province.
	   Rubin said ``stripping away the legitimate rights of the Kosovar
Albanian people'' had ``radicalized the Kosovar Albanian
population'' and would make more difficult the task of resolving
the crisis in ``the interests of both Yugoslavia and the people in
Kosovo.''

history, because it wanted greater control over the sale and
marketing of the natural gas.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil giant was the operator in a partnership with
Mobil Oil, based in Fairfax, Virginia. Mobil, which made no
separate announcement, is also pulling out of the deal.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police are investigating what is
believed to be the Dutch arm of an international child pornography
ring that has sexually abused children as young as 12 months and
spread digital images of the abuse on the Internet.
	   Computer material gathered last month by police from an
apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort contained ``a number of
images of very serious sexual abuse of children,'' police spokesman
Hans Vos said Thursday.
	   Vos added that it would take weeks for police to sift through
all the digital images they had found.
	   Respected Dutch current affairs program NOVA reported Wednesday
it had obtained computer disks containing thousands of ``very
shocking'' photographs of children being abused. One Dutch child
psychologist told NOVA the material was the worst he had ever seen,
involving children aged between 12 and 15 months.
	   ``The people who did this must feel the full force of the law,''
Germany's minister for family and youth, Claudia Nolte, said in
Bonn where news of the find also was publicized.
	   She said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has increased
penalties against the distribution of pornographic images.
	   ``The Internet is not a lawless space,'' she said.
	   Vos said Dutch police had been in ``intensive contact'' with
German and Belgian police forces but added that Dutch investigators
have not yet discovered where the ring was based or its size. Some
members reportedly come from Berlin.
	   A Belgian anti-child pornography group called Morkhoven also has
material from the Zandvoort flat but has not yet turned it over to
Dutch investigators, instead giving it to NOVA reporters.
	   The group came across the images when it was trying to trace a
missing German child believed to have been abducted and abused for
child pornography, according to the German newspaper Berliner
Morgenpost.
	   The child, Manuel Schadwald, disappeared aged 12 years in 1993
and was later reportedly seen in bordellos in Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, Berliner Morgenpost reported.
	   The owner of the Zandvoort apartment, a 49-year-old German
identified as Gert-Jan Ulrich, was recently murdered in Italy by a
suspected fellow gang member, apparently because he had tipped off
police about the ring's activities, Dutch media reported Thursday.
	   Members of Ulrich's family led police to his apartment where the
pornography was found saying they wanted to distance themselves
from the material, Vos said. He refused to elaborate.
	   Jacqueline Hemmes-Boender, a spokeswoman with Haarlem public
prosecutor's office, said police have one suspect in the case but
that he cannot immediately be arrested, leading to speculation that
he is Ulrich's suspected killer, who is reportedly in custody in
Italy awaiting trial.
	   Dutch authorities have not yet requested extradition of the man,
a Belgian whose identity was not released.

Religious leaders promise to halt circumcising the dead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Orthodox Jewish lawmakers told their secular
counterparts at an angry debate Thursday in parliament, that
incidents of rabbis performing circumcisions on deceased males are
isolated and would be halted immediately.
	   The two sides discussed reports that rabbis in Israel have
circumcised dead Russian immigrants, including soldiers who fell in
battle, without asking or informing their families.
	   Opposition lawmaker Ophir Pines-Paz, said the incidents were
part of an attempt by the religious minority to impose their
beliefs upon the secular majority.``First you make life miserable
for us and now you are seizing control of our deaths,'' he accused
religious lawmakers.
	   Yitzhak Vaknin, of the Orthodox Shas party lashed back, saying
secularists ``are opposed to every symbol of Judaism.'' Vaknin did
confirm that some burial societies had carried out the unauthorized
circumcisions, but said these were isolated cases and rabbinical
authorities had condemned the practice.
	   According to Jewish law, males are circumcised eight days after
birth. However, some of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants who
came to the Jewish state from the former Soviet Union, were not
circumcised because their families had drifted away from Judaism
after three generations under the Soviet regime.
	   ``Perhaps there should be a society for the protection of
genitals,'' quipped legislator Yuri Stern, himself a Russian
immigrant, during a lighter moment in what was a mostly heated
discussion in parliament's immigration committee.
	   Pines-Paz said he had received complaints that army rabbis had
circumcised immigrant soldiers who had fallen in battle, without
obtaining permission from their next-of-kin.
	   The army spokesman said its chief chaplain has not given any
order to circumcise deceased soldiers and he knew of no case in
which this had been done.
	   Rabbi Arieh Gamliel, the deputy minister for religious affairs,
said he would remind all the burial societies that circumcision
after death is absolutely forbidden unless the family, or the
deceased in his will, request it.

Belarusian president thanks Russia for neutral stance in `sewer
</HEADLINE>
war' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MINSK, Belarus (AP) _ President Alexander Lukashenko,
increasingly isolated by international opinion, thanked Russian
leaders Thursday for not joining a battle over diplomatic housing.
	   Lukashenko accused the West of launching ``a campaign of vicious
attacks on Belarus,'' and said he appreciated Russia's relatively
neutral stance in the dispute.
	   Although Russia has mildly criticized Lukashenko for evicting
diplomats from their homes in a leafy compound on the outskirts of
Minsk, the capital, it has not recalled its ambassador or joined in
the stronger protests against the move.
	   Belarus ordered the diplomats out of their homes, saying it
needed to repair plumbing and sewer lines in the compound. Later,
Lukashenko declared that the diplomatic compound was part of his
presidential residence.
	   The 15 European Union nations and nearly a dozen other
countries, including the United States, have imposed travel
restrictions on Belarusian officials over the housing dispute.
Ambassadors from a number of nations, including the United States
and all EU countries with embassies in Minsk, have been recalled to
their countries for consultations.
	   Lukashenko, addressing the governor of Russia's Kostroma region,
Viktor Shershuov, said Russia had withstood international pressure
by not taking a hard line against Belarus.
	   ``They are trying to break Russia's backbone,'' he said.
	   Russia and Belarus signed a union treaty last year that was
intended to break down many of the barriers between the two
neighbors, which were joined in Soviet years. However, Lukashenko
has frequently angered Russian officials and ties between the two
countries have at times been uneasy.

Lehman's almost misses Open after roughhousing with his kids
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ Tom Lehman may be a great golfer, but
he's apparently a lousy gymnast.
	   The '96 British Open champion came within 45 minutes of
withdrawing from Thursday's first round after he sprained his right
shoulder in a fall Tuesday ``roughhousing'' with his three
children.
	   ``We went over to the amusement park into the little discovery
zone place with the kids,'' said Lehman, who still nursed himself
to a 1-over 71.
	   ``I was just goofing off with my wife and the kids and _ shazam.
Basically, I was doing a handstand and kind of fell over on my
shoulder,'' he added, pausing for an embarrassed laugh.
	   ``Oooh it hurt, I couldn't even lift my arm. I couldn't even
lift my shirt without it hurting.''
	   ``I guess the funhouse wasn't that much fun,'' said his caddie
Andy Martinez.
	   Lehman, 39, notified the Royal and Ancient Golf Club late
Wednesday that alternate Malcolm McKenzie ``should get ready like
he's going to play,'' Lehman said.
	   ``I wasn't expecting to play and when I started warming up I
thought there was no way,'' he said. ``After an hour an a half of
practice it finally felt like I could get some club head speed
going.''
	   ``My swing still wasn't quite right, I kind of had to
manufacture a swing out there. But it was close enough so I could
at least find it.''
	   Lehman, who was initially reported to have been hurt falling
from a carousel, also sprained his left ankle a few weeks ago
walking around a course he's designing.
	   ``If I felt like I couldn't compete I would have stepped
aside,'' he said. ``But I've earned my right to play in the
tournament and I wasn't about to give it up without a fair
chance.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   UNFULFILLED MONTY: &LR;  It was another bad start for Scotland's
Colin Montgomerie, still chasing his first major. He shot 3-over 73
and again failed to break par in the first round of the British
Open. This is his ninth. He's missed the cut four times with a best
finish of eighth.
	   ``Hopefully I can make the cut. That's all my tournament is
about now,'' he said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SEVE'S TOUCH: &LR;  Three-time Open champion Seve Ballesteros is
mired in a slump and ranks only 97th on the European money list.
But he has the lowest putt-per-round mark in Europe _ 29.7 per
round.
	   His problem has been his driving. He shot an opening 3-over 73
Thursday and took three bogeys on the front nine, all due to ``bad
tee shots,'' a reminder he scribbled three times on his scorecard.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   STREAK: &LR;  Now that Jack Nicklaus' streak of 146 consecutive
majors has ended by missing this year's Open, Nick Faldo has the
mark for most consecutive appearances at 45. It goes back to 1987
when he won the Open at Muirfield. Faldo, who opened with a 72,
hasn't missed a cut in 22 straight majors. If he manages a sub-par
round at Royal Birkdale (par is 70), it will be his 34th time under
70 in a British Open to surpass Nicklaus' record of 33.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WEATHER FORECAST: &LR;  Light winds Thursday were expected to
increase on Friday, reaching 25 mph (40 kph) by late afternoon with
a chance of on-and-off rain.
	   ``The sun broke through today and it was perfect,'' said Tiger
Woods. ``You might even get some people with heats stroke out
there.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   YOU'RE THE MAN: &LR;  Lee Westwood and Tiger Woods both bragged about
the warm-hearted crowds Thursday. But Westwood, with a 1-over 71,
suggested he'd like to quiet a few Woods' fans.
	   ``The crowds were very good all the way around,'' the Englishman
said. ``A couple of `you're the man' have appeared, but hopefully
we can stamp them out early.''
	   He'd also like to ban mobile phones.
	   ``I don't know why people bring phones on to the golf course. If
you need to bring one you're too busy and shouldn't be here, you
should be at work.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHIP SHOTS: &LR;  Outstanding American amateur Matt Kuchar met
reality in the Open with a first-round 5-over 75. Spain's 18-year
Sergio ``El Nino'' Garcia _ pegged as the next Seve Ballesteros _
had a 1-under 69. A third amateur, Didier De Vooght of Belgium,
shot 70.
	   Englishman Gary Evans teed off in the first group at 7:15 a.m.
Thursday as his wife had gone into labor and shot 69... Jean Louis
Guepy of France hit the first ball in this year's Open.

Blues sign free-agent Young to four-year deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ The St. Louis Blues signed right wing Scott
Young to a four-year contract Thursday, helping to fill a void left
by the departure of Brett Hull.
	   Young is an unrestricted free agent who played last season with
the Anaheim Mighty Ducks. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
	   Hull, one of the best and most colorful players in Blues
history, became an unrestricted free agent after balking at a dlrs
15 million contract offer in March because it did not include a
no-trade clause. The Blues later decided not to re-sign him.
	   Hull, who has 554 career goals, signed a three-year, dlrs 17.5
million deal with the Dallas Stars.
	   Young realizes it will be tough to compete with Hull's legacy.
	   ``I know expectations are high, and I am honored that the St.
Louis Blues had such great interest in me,'' he said.
	   Young was on the Colorado team that won the Stanley Cup in 1996.
He also played for Pittsburgh when the Penguins won the Cup in
1991.
	   Young played in 73 games last season, recording 13 goals, 20
assists and 22 penalty minutes. He scored a career-high 30 goals
with the Quebec Nordiques in 1992-93, and had 64 points for
Hartford in 1989-90.
	   Young was selected by the Hartford Whalers as their first
choice, 11th overall, in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. He also was a
member of the U.S. squad that won the World Cup in 1996, and played
on United States Olympic teams in 1988 and 1992.

Ukrainian envoys meets Nigerian ruler over captive sailors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ Ukrainian officials met Thursday with
Nigeria's military ruler in a bid to obtain freedom for 27
Ukrainian sailors held for ransom over the past 11 months by a
wealthy Nigerian businessman.
	   A member of the Ukrainian delegation, Andrei Sokorchuk, emerged
from the meeting describing the captor, Nigerian oil firm owner and
chieftain H.I.S. Idisi, as a ``terrorist who will not listen to
reason.''
	   He declined to give details of the discussions.
	   Nigerian officials who asked to remain anonymous said military
leader Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar was planning to order Nigerian
security forces to storm the heavily-guarded building in the
southern Nigeria port of Sapele where the sailors were being held.
	   Idisi's armed henchmen forced the Ukrainians to remain on their
ship for 10 months, Dubai Valor, after the vessel docked in port in
early August 1997.
	   The captives, several of whom fell seriously ill after being
left with little provisions of food, water, fuel and medication on
the ship, were eventually taken ashore in June and detained in a
private building in the port city.
	   Idisi had accused the ship's owners of losing cargo worth dlrs
one million belonging to Idisi's oil industry firm, Lonestar
Drilling.
	   Although the ship's owners _ whose identity has not been
disclosed _ paid a dlrs one million bond to judicial officials for
the vessel's release several weeks after its capture, Idisi decided
to detain the Ukrainians until he received the cash, said Femi
Atoyebi, a lawyer for the captives.
	   ``It is inconceivable how a private individual will hold 27
foreigners hostage over a simple claim for alleged breach of
contract,'' said Atoyebi. ``It is more particularly intriguing when
it is realized that the crew members are no parties to the civil
proceedings.''
	   Over the past five years, expatriate oil workers have on several
occasions been taken hostage by aggrieved communities seeking
payouts from oil companies.
	   Rule of law has deteriorated in decades past in Nigeria, which
has been headed by military leaders for all but 10 of the past 38
years since independence from Britain.
	   Abubakar has promised democratic reforms since taking over in
early June after his predecessor, Gen. Sani Abacha died of a heart
attack.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Opposition parties harshly
criticized President Carlos Menem on Thursday after he made his
strongest statement to date that he wants to run for a third
straight time.
	   Despite a constitutional limit of two consecutive terms, Menem
said late Wednesday he would like to be a candidate for the 1999
election _ something his aides hinted at for months.
	   ``I'm going to consult with members of Congress on Friday to see
what I have to do to present myself as a candidate for 1999,''
Menem told the Argentine network Todos Noticias.
	   Menem was elected in 1989 for a single six-year term. After the
constitution was amended in 1994, Menem was allowed to run for a
second four-year term. For months, Menem supporters have been
talking about amending the constitution again to allow a third term
or asking the Supreme Court to declare the two-term limit
unconstitutional.
	   The Supreme Court said Wednesday it has not considered the issue
and had not ``established a date to do it.''
	   For months, while Menem said little of re-election, his top
aides frequently talked of a possible third candidacy, spurring
intense infighting within the president's Peronist party.
	   Opposition hopefuls for 1999 accuse the president of seeking
ways to circumvent the law to stay in power.
	   ``Leave aside your personal ambitions and respect the law and
preserve Argentina's institutions,'' the centrist Radical Civic
Union, the leading opposition party, said in a statement Thursday.
	   The Radicals, along with the left-leaning Frepaso party, make up
the Alliance coalition, which has vowed to challenge Menem in 1999.
	   ``He is convinced he is the only one able to govern,'' said
Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a Frepaso deputy and 1999 hopeful.
	   In recent weeks, Menem's aides have begun to push for
demonstrations of popular support on his behalf. The governor of
Menem's hometown province of La Rioja recently called for a
referendum to test his re-election chances.
	   Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires province and
Menem's chief Peronist rival, quickly countered by announcing plans
for a Sept. 13 non-binding referendum of his own in Argentina's
largest province.
	   Menem is considered less popular in the province, home to 8
million voters.
	   The Menem-Duhalde rivalry has produced a flurry of
behind-the-scenes politicking ahead of a national Peronist
convention scheduled for Friday _ an opportnity for Menem to gather
re-election support.
	   The uproar over re-election has overshadowed much-needed
legislative work on tax and labor reforms.
	   Carlos Rodriguez, a deputy economics minister, warned in a
newspaper interview that talk of amending the constitution could
tarnish the country's image abroad, particularly in the eyes of
investors. Local media later reported he would be resigning.
	   Menem is credited with turning around Argentina's economy, but
continued high unemployment, reported this week at 13.4 percent,
has hurt his popularity at home.

Frightening injury jolts Astros, offers scary reminder of game's

<TEXT>
	   PHOENIX (AP) _ There are few moments in sports more frightening
than the one that silenced the big Bank One Ballpark crowd.
	   Billy Wagner, ace reliever for the Houston Astros, was felled by
a line drive to the head in the ninth inning Wednesday night. The
ball careened nearly to the Arizona Diamondbacks' dugout. Wagner
collapsed on his back, his legs flopping wildly.
	   ``It's a pitcher's worst nightmare,'' said his close friend,
Houston pitcher Mike Magnante. ``You just hope it never happens.''
	   Many in the crowd of 42,229 stood. Spectators covered their
mouths in shock. Players from both teams crowded around the fallen
pitcher. Second baseman Craig Biggio noticed a patch of blood below
Wagner's ear.
	   ``I was just praying that he was all right,'' Houston manager
Larry Dierker said, ``and so was everybody else.''
	   Amazingly for anyone who saw the blow, either in person or on
ESPN's telecast, Wagner appeared not to be seriously injured. He
was rushed to St. Joseph's Medical Center, where he underwent a
series of neurological tests.
	   Wagner had a cut near his left ear but never lost consciousness,
and a CAT scan showed no internal damage, said Alyson Footer, an
Astros spokeswoman in Houston. He was kept overnight for
observation.
	   The Astros lost the game 9-8 in 11 innings, but that was not
uppermost in their minds. In the silence of the Houston locker room
after the game, there was only quiet concern for Wagner and an
unstated realization that this is a game that has the potential for
serious injury or worse.
	   Mike Hampton, the pitcher who had started the game, couldn't
talk to reporters. He sat in the chair in front of his locker,
sobbing.
	   Wagner is among the most popular of the Astros. The left-hander
always sprints to the mound, jumping over the foul line along the
way.
	   Arizona's Kelly Stinnett caught one of those fastballs and sent
it right back up the middle. Wagner tried to get his glove up. But,
standing just 60 feet, 6 inches (18 meters) away, he didn't quite
make it.
	   ``It's scary as hell,'' said Magnante, who was watching from the
bullpen.
	   Back in Houston, Wagner's wife Sarah is eight months' pregnant
with their first child.
	   A medical team immobilized Wagner's head and placed him on a
stretcher before driving him off the field on a cart.

Bowman undergoes heart catheterization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROYAL OAK, Michigan (AP) _ Red Wings coach Scotty Bowman
underwent a procedure on Thursday to unclog a blocked heart artery.
	   Dr. William O'Neill, William Beaumont Hospital's chief of
cardiology, said Bowman was resting comfortably and should be
released Friday.
	   He said no decision has been made on whether Bowman will return
to coach the Red Wings for the final year of his contract next
season.
	   Bowman, who turns 65 in September, has said his rejoining the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champions for the final year of his
contract would depend on whether his health allows it.
	   Bowman last week had a routine evaluation that included a
cardiac stress test, which O'Neill said was inconclusive and
prompted further tests he called routine.
	   O'Neill said the tests were sought because of Bowman's family
history of heart disease. Last month, Bowman's 61-year-old brother,
Jack _ a longtime NHL scout _ died during heart surgery.
	   The doctor said it was fortunate Bowman's condition was caught
before he had a planned knee operation this summer.
	   ``Had this not been caught before the knee surgery, there's a
very big possibility he would've had a heart attack during the knee
surgery.''
	   O'Neill said the knee problem stems from severe arthritis and
previous ligament damage.
	   ``He can't walk on it. It's really crippling him,'' O'neill
said. ``He is completely set on having that fixed.''
	   Bowman, the National Hockey League's winningest coach, has won a
record-tying eight Stanley Cups in 26 years as an NHL coach _ five
titles with Montreal, two with Detroit and one with Pittsburgh.

Israeli businessman sentenced to 16 years for sales to Iran

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The justice ministry announced Thursday
that it will look into allegations of misconduct in a high profile
treason trial rife with scandal.
	   The proceedings were tainted by defense charges that the judge
had secretly maintained a ``close, intensive'' relationship with a
female member of the defense team and discussed the case with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu has vehemently denied the charges. On Thursday, he
accused opposition legislators who had first raised the allegations
of waging a political smear campaign against him.
	   The preliminary investigation was announced hours after Nahum
Manbar, convicted of treason, was sentenced to 16 years in jail for
selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   Manbar's attorney Amnon Zichroni alleged Tuesday that Judge
Amnon Straschnov had an intimate relationship with Pninat Yanai, a
former member of his defense team who is also a friend of
Netanyahu's spokesman.
	   Yanai, however, said the charges were made up by a jilted
ex-boyfriend eager to get her back. She also said that Zichroni
tried to used her friendship with Straschnov to help his client's
case.
	   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit Shemesh told The Associated
Press that Attorney General Elkyakim Rubinstein asked the police to
begin a ``preliminary investigation into all allegations
surrounding the trial.''
	   Straschnov has denied all the allegations and rejected a request
by Zichroni to withdraw from the case before passing sentence.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Manbar's conviction and sentence.
Despite his earlier accusations against the judge, Zichroni was
evasive Thursday when asked whether he would make alleged improper
judicial conduct a key element of his appeal.
	   The trial was closed and all of the testimony is classified.
	   The justice ministry said it was not yet clear who police would
question in the investigation. Last year, Netanyahu was questioned
by police investigating a government influence-peddling scandal.
	   At Tel Aviv's District Court Thursday, Straschnov said Manbar
sacrificed Israel's security ``on the altar of unfettered greed.''
Iran is one of Israel's most implacable foes.
	   Shortly after sentencing, Netanyahu said he was pleased with the
verdict, saying Manbar had committed ``heinous crimes'' by
supplying Iran with material ``to rain down chemical death on
Israel's cities _ on our citizens and children.''
	   Manbar, who faced life in prison, sat stone-faced as he heard
the decision. When he was walked out of the court Manbar shouted:
``There will be an appeal.''
	   Manbar maintained that his business with Iran was sanctioned by
Israel's intelligence community. Yossi Melman, a journalist for the
Haaretz newspaper said that Manbar was not alone in doing business
with Iran, adding that in the early 1990s, Israeli companies sold
mortar shells and fertilizer with the knowledge of the security
establishment.
	   Netanyahu was criticized after Manbar's conviction last month
for saying he hoped the court would issue a stiff sentence.
	   Nissim Zvili, a legislator from the opposition Labor Party,
called Tuesday for an investigation of allegations that Netanyahu
had discussed the case with Straschnov and, under pressure from the
United States, tried to influence him. Zvili later withdrew the
demand, saying he accepted the judge's denial.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday accused the opposition of taking advantage
of the Manbar affair to raise ``baseless claims'' in order to
defame him and the integrity of Israel's justice system.
	   ``If I ever thought there was a limit to how low my opponents
were willing to go, it turns out I was wrong,'' he said.

After cease-fire, U.N. ready to deliver food to starving Sudanese
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ The United Nations put in place Thursday
plans to deliver food to thousands of starving people in southern
Sudan after the government and a rebel group agreed on a
three-month cease-fire.
	   The World Food Program will begin flying on Friday an
Ilyushin-76 aircraft out of Khartoum to deliver food to the Bahr
el-Ghazal province, where more than 700,000 people are facing
famine, the U.N. agency's resource director, Tun Myat, told
reporters.
	   He said another three Il-76 aircraft will join the fleet in the
coming days.
	   The WFP estimates that outside Bahr el-Ghazal some 1.9 million
more Sudanese are in urgent need of food. The WFP plans to deliver
15,000 tons of food per month in Sudan over the next four months.
The program will cost dlrs 84 million.
	   Meanwhile, at a separate news conference, Sudan's Foreign
Minister Mustafa Osman Ismail warned the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army not to take advantage of the truce, which began
Wednesday.
	   ``We will observe the cease-fire and will not use it to attack
the other side,'' Ismail said.
	   ``But if it is used as a trick to attack us, we will defend
ourselves,'' he told the news conference, which was attended by
visiting British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett.
	   Fatchett had met with both sides to help secure the cease-fire,
which calls for setting up safe corridors into southern Sudan for
the delivery of relief and humanitarian supplies.
	   The truce ``should also give renewed confidence to the Sudanese
government and the SPLA to engage in a broader political
discussion,'' Fatchett said.
	   The government had responded Wednesday to the SPLA cease-fire
with a one-month truce, but Ismail said Thursday that the military
will suspend the war for three months, ``hoping that this will lead
to an open cease-fire.''
	   Fighting between the SPLA and government troops has prevented
people from planting crops and has made delivery of relief food
difficult. The area is also suffering from drought.
	   Myat, the WFP official, said the United Nations intends to
deliver food through three safe passage corridors opened under the
cease-fire terms:
	   _ by trucks on a road from Koboko, Uganda;
	   _ on ferries sailing down the Bahr el-Ghazal river from Kosti in
northern Sudan;
	   _ and by two trains every month from Babanusa in northern Sudan
to Bahr el-Ghazal's biggest city, Wau.
	   Problems, however, were already cropping up for the WFP outside
Bahr el-Ghazal region.
	   Two WFP staffers were forced to flee insecurity in the western
Upper Nile town of Leer Thursday where they were just starting food
distribution for 30,000 people, said Michele Quintaglie, an agency
spokeswoman in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.
	   The aid workers were contacted by radio and no other details
were available, Quintaglie said.
	   It was not clear if the staffers were blocked by government
troops or SPLA soldiers.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy for the
predominantly African, Christian and animist south, which has
historically been dominated by the Muslim and Arab north. An
estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
resulting famines.

France rolls out red carpet for Assad, hoping visit will pay off
</HEADLINE>

with Assad blaming Israel for impasse in peace process, Chirac
pressing for French-Egypt proposal for conference; Brunner

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Syria's red, white and black flag flew on the
Champs-Elysees Thursday, a sign of the red-carpet treatment France
is giving President Hafez Assad in hopes his rare visit can bring a
new dimension to the Mideast peace process.
	   France, Chirac said during a toast at a state dinner hours after
Assad's arrival, is determined ``not to let the peace process
collapse.''
	   ``This peace, I am convinced, remains possible,'' Chirac said.
	   Assad blamed Israel for ``reducing to zero'' the peace process.
	   ``The Israeli government has refused the judicial framework of
the peace process,'' Assad said during his dinner toast in a
reference to the land-for-peace notion that underpins the process,
``replacing it with security for Israel ....''
	   ``A just and global peace is our goal and our strategic
choice,'' Assad said, ``and we work to realize it.''
	   The two-day state visit -- the first here in 22 years -- was
also cause for controversy, notably over the case of accused war
criminal Alois Brunner, said to be hiding in Syria.
	   The presidential spokeswoman said Chirac went to the heart of
the issue during two hours and 40 minutes of talks, but failed to
get a ``precise response'' from Assad. Chirac planned to bring up
the case again at dinner, according to Catherine Colonna.
	   Brunner has been the object of a French judicial investigation
since 1988, and families of Holocaust victims protested Assad's
silence at a demonstration in front of the Syrian Embassy.
	   Chirac greeted Assad and an entourage of five ministers at Orly
airport with a fanfare welcome of Marines and martial music.
	   The pomp accorded Assad, the austere 67-year-old leader who
rarely travels abroad, was a sign of French hopes that the visit
will pay off with improved ties and trade and, more importantly,
with new impetus to the blocked Middle East peace process.
	   Chirac, who visited Damascus in 1996, has actively sought a
clear role for France, and Europe, in the peace process, and Assad,
who is seeking an alternative to American mediation, could provide
it.
	   During the dinner toast and in talks, Chirac pressed a
French-Egyptian proposal made in May for an international
conference to save the peace process.
	   While reiterating his support for American mediation, Chirac
said it is necessary to reflect on what to do ``in case the current
efforts halt.''
	   An international conference could end the impasse, Chirac said.
	   Assad apparently gave only a lukewarm response to the proposal.
Colonna said only that Assad ``did not refuse the idea.''
	   France has particular leverage in the Middle East today because
of its past presence there. Syria, for instance, was a
French-mandated territory from 1920-46.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy to break the lengthy impasse. And French
intervention in the region has occasionally advanced the process
where American policy failed.
	   During Israel's offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon in 1996, France engineered a truce that still
stands. And last month, France guaranteed an exchange of prisoners
and soldiers' remains between Lebanon and Israel.
	   Syria is demanding Israel hand over the Golan Heights, seized in
1967, in exchange for peace.
	   Chirac, in turn, told Assad of France's wish to see Lebanon
``free and sovereign on all its territory,'' a reference to both
Syrian and Israeli troops there.
	   Assad replied that he ``understands the French position,''
spokeswoman Colonna said.
	   Assad last visited France in 1976, when Chirac was prime
minister. Assad has not left his region since a 1994 meeting with
President Clinton in Geneva.

Israeli ambassador complains about U.N. protest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Israel's U.N. ambassador denied Thursday
that Israeli defense forces were responsible for a mortar attack in
south Lebanon that wounded two people, including a U.N.
peacekeeper.
	   Dore Gold made his case before Security Council president Sergey
Lavrov of Russia, who had said Wednesday that the council supported
a protest made by the U.N. mission in South Lebanon to Israel over
the attack.
	   Gold said that the attack on Haddatha, on the edge of the
Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon, was carried out by the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army in retaliation for an attack by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia.
	   ``There was no intention by the South Lebanon Army as far as we
understand, to strike any fixed UNIFIL positions,'' Gold said after
meeting with Lavrov. ``This is an incident which was caused by
Hezbollah operations against the South Lebanon Army.''
	   Troops of the nine-country, 4,500-member U.N. force in Lebanon
often have been caught in the fighting between Israeli forces and
guerrillas and 220 soldiers have died in attacks and accidents
since the force was deployed in 1978.
	   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said that a mortar round Thursday
came within five meters (yards) of a U.N. checkpost but that no one
was injured.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to
try to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 members of the
Israeli-allied South Lebanon Army militia from the occupied zone.
	   Israel set up the zone in 1985 to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla attacks. U.N. resolutions call for
Israel to withdraw from the enclave.

Argentine opposition angered by President Menem's wish for third

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Opposition parties harshly
criticized President Carlos Menem on Thursday after he made his
strongest statement to date that he wants to run for a third
straight time.
	   Despite a constitutional limit of two consecutive terms, Menem
said late Wednesday he would like to be a candidate for his
Peronist party in the 1999 election _ something his aides hinted at
for months.
	   ``I'm going to consult with the Peronist delegates on Friday to
see what I have to do to present myself as a candidate for 1999,''
Menem told the Argentine network Todos Noticias.
	   Menem was elected in 1989 for a single six-year term. After the
constitution was amended in 1994, Menem was allowed to run for a
second four-year term. For months, Menem supporters have been
talking about amending the constitution again to allow a third term
or asking the Supreme Court to declare the two-term limit
unconstitutional.
	   The Supreme Court said Wednesday it has not considered the issue
and had not ``established a date to do it.''
	   For months, while Menem said little of re-election, his top
aides frequently talked of a possible third candidacy, spurring
intense infighting within the president's Peronist party.
	   Opposition hopefuls for 1999 accuse the president of seeking
ways to circumvent the law to stay in power.
	   ``Leave aside your personal ambitions and respect the law and
preserve Argentina's institutions,'' the centrist Radical Civic
Union, the leading opposition party, said in a statement Thursday.
	   The Radicals, along with the left-leaning Frepaso party, make up
the Alliance coalition, which has vowed to challenge Menem in 1999.
	   ``He is convinced he is the only one able to govern,'' said
Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a Frepaso deputy and 1999 hopeful.
	   In recent weeks, Menem's aides have begun to push for
demonstrations of popular support on his behalf. The governor of
Menem's hometown province of La Rioja recently called for a
referendum to test his re-election chances.
	   Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires province and
Menem's chief Peronist rival, quickly countered by announcing plans
for a Sept. 13 non-binding referendum of his own in Argentina's
largest province.
	   Menem is considered less popular in the province, home to 8
million voters.
	   The Menem-Duhalde rivalry has produced a flurry of
behind-the-scenes politicking ahead of a national Peronist
convention scheduled for Friday _ an opportnity for Menem to gather
re-election support.
	   The uproar over re-election has overshadowed much-needed
legislative work on tax and labor reforms.
	   Carlos Rodriguez, a deputy economics minister, warned in a
newspaper interview that talk of amending the constitution could
tarnish the country's image abroad, particularly in the eyes of
investors. Local media later reported he would be resigning.
	   Menem is credited with turning around Argentina's economy, but
continued high unemployment, reported Thursday at 13.2 percent, has
hurt his popularity at home.

Rising stars try to make their mark at British Open

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ The only thing that separates Lee
Westwood and David Duval is which side of the Atlantic they call
home.
	   They are the hottest players in the world on their respective
sides of the pond, both in their 20s, both having won more
tournaments than anyone else during the past nine months.
	   And when the 127th British Open begins Thursday at Royal
Birkdale, both will be out to prove that the youth movement taking
over golf's major championships has room for them.
	   ``Whenever I turn up at a tournament now, I feel like I should
be in contention,'' said the 25-year-old Westwood, who has won
three of his last four starts on the European tour.
	   The 26-year-old Duval has won twice on the PGA Tour this year.
He nearly broke through with his first major at the Masters until
Mark O'Meara surged past him with birdies on three of the last four
holes.
	   ``If the opportunity presents itself, I feel like I'm certainly
ready,'' Duval said.
	   Their biggest challenge this week may not be the fickle winds
gusting along the Lancashire coast, not the heather or the gorse or
any other trouble awaiting a shot that doesn't stay in the short
grass.
	   The pressure to win their first major will be chasing them
around Royal Birkdale the same way it has chased Phil Mickelson the
past four years, the same way it has hounded Colin Montgomerie ever
since he first contended at a major in the U.S. Open six years ago.
	   Five players in their 20s have won their first major in the
1990s _ Tiger Woods and Justin Leonard last year (Masters and
British Open), Ernie Els at the 1994 U.S. Open, Lee Janzen at the
1993 U.S. Open and John Daly at the PGA Championship in 1991.
	   Of that fraternity, only Woods heard his name mentioned as a
possible winner _ Jack Nicklaus predicted he would win 10 green
jackets, but Woods was not regarded as a favorite until the
weekend.
	   ``I didn't feel a lot of pressure from the media or from just
the general public,'' Leonard said, referring to his win last year
at Royal Troon, where he came from five strokes behind in the final
round.
	   ``Most of that pressure really was put on Phil Mickelson, Davis
Love and Colin Montgomerie,'' he said. ``I'm certain that guys like
Jim (Furyk) and Darren Clarke, Lee and David, they all expect
themselves to challenge and compete _ and now the media and general
public does.''
	   If the spotlight isn't hot enough, Westwood and Duval figure to
have plenty of company in their pursuit of the Claret Jug.
	   Woods hasn't contended at a major since winning at Augusta last
year, but his length should make him a factor at Royal Birkdale,
which features two par 5s on the closing four holes.
	   And it's not like the old guard has left town. Masters winner
O'Meara, 41, finished third at Birkdale seven years ago.
	   Lee Janzen made it three in a row for the over-30 set at the
U.S. Open, and Fred Couples joins Duval as the only other two-time
winner on the PGA Tour this year.
	   And don't forget Tom Watson, who has spent this week retracing
his steps and thinking over the strategy that helped him to victory
at Birkdale in 1983, the last of his eight major championships. At
48, he has not lost sight of joining Harry Vardon with six British
Open titles.
	   ``I have a belief that I can win this tournament,'' Watson said.
	   The fierce winds that made practice rounds feel like
self-inflicted punishment subsided slightly on the eve of the Open,
but the focus on Westwood and Duval was as strong as ever.
	   ``I would say Lee Westwood must be the favorite this week,''
said Els, who is listed with Westwood as the best bets at Birkdale
by British oddsmakers. ``He has been the hottest player _ him and
David Duval.''
	   Westwood, touted by Nick Faldo as Britain's next great golfer,
has certainly lived up to the billing.
	   Starting with the Volvo Masters last year, Westwood won seven
tournaments on four continents in the past nine months, including
the Freeport-McDermott Classic in New Orleans the week before the
Masters.
	   ``I guess I would compare him to David Duval in the way that
winning is getting to be a real habit,'' Tom Lehman said.
	   Winning last week at Loch Lomond puts Westwood in position to
earn a dlrs 1 million bonus should he win this week.
	   But Westwood also carries the burden of trying to become the
first Englishman to win an Open in his native country since Tony
Jacklin at Royal Lytham in 1969. (All three of Faldo's Open
victories were in Scotland.)
	   Even though Faldo warned the British press to leave the
25-year-old alone, Westwood, with a gap-tooth smile and a game
beyond his years, seems to be doing quite fine.
	   ``I'm not afraid of winning, I'm not afraid of losing,'' he
said. ``I won't be nervous coming down the stretch if I'm leading.
It won't bother me.''
	   That nonchalance is what carried Duval through seven near-misses
on the PGA Tour. There was a steely confidence in his game that
served him well once he finally broke through in October.
	   And while Duval may not play the worldwide schedule of Westwood,
he does have the experience of contending at a major. He handled
the Sunday pressure with alarming calm, his only miscue coming on
the 16th hole with a tee shot that missed by about 10 feet (3
meters) _ the difference between possible birdie and the three-putt
bogey.

	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ U.S. drug czar Barry R. McCaffrey
seemed like a changed man. Just days ago, he dubbed the Dutch drug
policy an ``unmitigated disaster,'' but after a closer look
Thursday, he talked about ``a strong feeling of partnership'' with
his hosts.
	   ``I walk away from this visit with some things that I think will
assist us in developing a more sensible American drug policy,''
McCaffrey told reporters after a day-long visit to study the
permissive Dutch narcotics policy.
	   His harsh criticism of the Dutch policy ahead of the visit
prompted officials here to question the value of his mission, which
has become a showdown of sorts between America's zero-tolerance
approach to drugs and the laissez-faire Dutch policy.
	   From the corridors of Dutch government buildings where
retaliatory statements were issued, to funky coffee shops where
hashish and marijuana are sold over the counter, the retired
four-star general has attracted attention.
	   ``He (McCaffrey) has to come to our coffee shop and look around.
The atmosphere is good and there is no violence,'' said Anouke
Scholten, who works at Amsterdam's Coffeeshop 36.
	   Not a chance. McCaffrey described coffee shops as ``an
impairment of the drug prevention message.''
	   After arriving in Amsterdam early morning, McCaffrey plunged
into a packed day of meetings with officials representing every
facet of the Dutch drug policy.
	   Presentations, which aimed at giving McCaffrey an overview of
the policy, ranged from the country's heroin handout experiment to
techniques used by customs authorities in the world's largest port,
Rotterdam, to interdict narcotics trafficking.
	   He ended the day with a dinner with the Dutch Health Minister
Els Borst, whose ministry oversees the country's drug policy.
	   Describing his visit as ``intensive and useful,'' McCaffrey
expressed his respect for those in the fight against drugs, from
law enforcement officers to health care workers.
	   But he also expressed some concerns, warning of a production
surge in the Netherlands of amphetamines, the synthetic
hallucinogen Ecstasy and Nederwiet, a potent Dutch-grown marijuana.
	   McCaffrey also added he does not support Dutch experiments that
dole out free heroine to long-term addicts who have failed at other
treatments.
	   ``This does not constitute drug treatment,'' he said.
	   He also disagreed with the Dutch's views on cannabis, saying he
and other U.S. officials, including Donna Shalala, the secretary of
health and human services, ``adamantly oppose to the use of
marijuana by our society.''
	   But despite the two nations' differences, McCaffrey said: ``I've
ended the day with a strong feeling of partnership.''
	   Although still technically illegal, the sale and consumption of
small amounts of soft drugs like hashish and marijuana are
tolerated by Dutch authorities.
	   Hard drugs like cocaine and heroin cannot be sold in coffee
shops, but are also are cheap and easily available on the streets.
	   As well as the ``unmitigated disaster'' description, McCaffrey
this week claimed that the Dutch murder rate is twice as high as
that in the United States due to the tolerant Dutch drug policy.
	   The Dutch angrily publicized statistics refuting McCaffrey's
claims and stood by their often-criticized policy.
	   ``We believe in our own policy, but we're not saying `you have
to do what we do,''' said Health Ministry spokesman Benno Bruggink.
``We are not exporting our policy.''

Israeli businessman sentenced to 16 years for sales to Iran

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The justice ministry announced Thursday
that it will look into allegations of misconduct in a high profile
treason trial rife with scandal.
	   The proceedings were tainted by defense charges that the judge
had secretly maintained a ``close, intensive'' relationship with a
female member of the defense team and discussed the case with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu has vehemently denied the charges. On Thursday, he
accused opposition legislators who had first raised the
allegations, of waging a political smear campaign against him.
	   The preliminary investigation was announced hours after Nahum
Manbar, convicted of treason, was sentenced to 16 years in jail for
selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   Manbar's attorney Amnon Zichroni alleged Tuesday that Judge
Amnon Straschnov had an intimate relationship with Pninat Yanai, a
former member of his defense team who is also a friend of
Netanyahu's spokesman.
	   Yanai, however countered the charges which she said were made up
by a jilted ex-boyfriend eager to get her back. She also said that
Zichroni tried to used her friendship with Straschnov to help his
client's case.
	   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit Shemesh told The Associated
Press that Attorney General Elkyakim Rubinstein asked the police to
begin a ``preliminary investigation into all allegations
surrounding the trial.''
	   Straschnov has denied all the allegations and rejected a request
by Zichroni to withdraw from the case before passing sentence.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Manbar's conviction and sentence.
Despite his earlier charges against the judge, Zichroni was evasive
Thursday when asked whether he would make alleged improper judicial
conduct a key element of his appeal.
	   The trail was held behind closed doors and all of the testimony
is classified.
	   The justice ministry said it was not yet clear who police would
question in the investigation. Last year, Netanyahu was questioned
by police investigating a government influence-peddling scandal.
	   At Tel Aviv's District Court Thursday, Straschnov said Manbar
sacrificed Israel's security ``on the altar of unfettered greed.''
Iran is one of Israel's most implacable foes.
	   Shortly after sentencing, Netanyahu said he was pleased with the
verdict, saying Manbar had committed ``heinous crimes'' by
supplying Iran with material ``to rain down chemical death on
Israel's cities _ on our citizens and children.''
	   Manbar, who faced life in prison, sat stone-faced as he heard
the decision. When he was walked out of the court Manbar shouted:
``There will be an appeal.''
	   Manbar maintained that his business with Iran was sanctioned by
Israel's intelligence community. Yossi Melman, a journalist for the
Haaretz newspaper said that Manbar was not alone in doing business
with Iran, adding that in the early 1990s, Israeli companies sold
mortar shells and fertilizer with the knowledge of the security
establishment.
	   Last year, Israeli newspapers reported that U.S. officials had
asked Netanyahu to stop Manbar's activities and that the CIA
provided information to Israel on Manbar's links with Iran which
violated an embargo on business dealings with the Islamic republic.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Workers protesting the
privatization of Puerto Rico's telephone company voted Thursday to
stay on strike until the government promises they won't be punished
for their walkout.
	   Delegates of the 2,200-member Independent Brotherhood of
Telephone Employees gave a vote of confidence to union leader Annie
Cruz, who wants a no-firings pledge before calling an end to the
month-old strike.
	   Members of the 4,200-strong Independent Telephone Employees
Union were considering a similar vote Thursday. Union negotiations
with the government were to resume Friday.
	   Sanctions stand in the way of ending the strike, which was
called to protest the sale of Puerto Rico Telephone Co. to
investors led by GTE Corp. of Stamford, Connecticut.
	   Both unions want to ensure that the government won't fire or
suspend returning strikers. They also want no reprisals against
thousands of public sector employees who staged a 48-hour general
strike last week in support of the telephone workers.

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The justice ministry announced Thursday
that it will look into allegations of misconduct in a high profile
treason trial rife with scandal.
	   The proceedings were tainted by defense charges that the judge
had secretly maintained a ``close, intensive'' relationship with a
female member of the defense team and discussed the case with Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Netanyahu has vehemently denied the charges. On Thursday, he
accused opposition legislators who had first raised the
allegations, of waging a political smear campaign against him.
	   The preliminary investigation was announced hours after Nahum
Manbar, convicted of treason, was sentenced to 16 years in jail for
selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
	   Manbar's attorney Amnon Zichroni alleged Tuesday that Judge
Amnon Straschnov had an intimate relationship with Pninat Yanai, a
former member of his defense team who is also a friend of
Netanyahu's spokesman.
	   Yanai, however countered the charges which she said were made up
by a jilted ex-boyfriend eager to get her back. She also said that
Zichroni tried to used her friendship with Straschnov to help his
client's case.
	   Justice Ministry spokeswoman Orit Shemesh told The Associated
Press that Attorney General Elkyakim Rubinstein asked the police to
begin a ``preliminary investigation into all allegations
surrounding the trial.''
	   Straschnov has denied all the allegations and rejected a request
by Zichroni to withdraw from the case before passing sentence.
	   Zichroni said he would appeal Manbar's conviction and sentence.
Despite his earlier charges against the judge, Zichroni was evasive
Thursday when asked whether he would make alleged improper judicial
conduct a key element of his appeal.
	   The trail was held behind closed doors and all of the testimony
is classified.
	   The justice ministry said it was not yet clear who police would
question in the investigation. Last year, Netanyahu was questioned
by police investigating a government influence-peddling scandal.
	   At Tel Aviv's District Court Thursday, Straschnov said Manbar
sacrificed Israel's security ``on the altar of unfettered greed.''
Iran is one of Israel's most implacable foes.
	   Shortly after sentencing, Netanyahu said he was pleased with the
verdict, saying Manbar had committed ``heinous crimes'' by
supplying Iran with material ``to rain down chemical death on
Israel's cities _ on our citizens and children.''
	   Manbar, who faced life in prison, sat stone-faced as he heard
the decision. When he was walked out of the court Manbar shouted:
``There will be an appeal.''
	   Manbar maintained that his business with Iran was sanctioned by
Israel's intelligence community. Yossi Melman, a journalist for the
Haaretz newspaper said that Manbar was not alone in doing business
with Iran, adding that in the early 1990s, Israeli companies sold
mortar shells and fertilizer with the knowledge of the security
establishment.
	   Last year, Israeli newspapers reported that U.S. officials had
asked Netanyahu to stop Manbar's activities and that the CIA
provided information to Israel on Manbar's links with Iran which
violated an embargo on business dealings with the Islamic republic.

France rolls out red carpet for Assad, hoping visit will pay off

	   PARIS (AP) _ Syria's red, white and black flag flew on the
Champs-Elysees Thursday, a sign of the red-carpet treatment France
is giving President Hafez Assad in hopes his rare visit can bring a
new dimension to the Mideast peace process.
	   France, Chirac said during a toast at a state dinner hours after
Assad's arrival, is determined ``not to let the peace process
collapse.''
	   ``This peace, I am convinced, remains possible,'' Chirac said.
	   Assad blamed Israel for ``reducing to zero'' the process.
	   ``The Israeli government has refused the judicial framework of
the peace process,'' Assad said during his dinner toast,
``replacing it with security for Israel ....'' He was referring to
the land-for-peace notion that underpins the peace process.
	   ``A just and global peace is our goal and our strategic
choice,'' Assad said, ``and we work to realize it.''
	   The two-day state visit -- the first here in 22 years -- was
also cause for controversy, notably over the case of accused war
criminal Alois Brunner, said to be hiding in Syria.
	   The presidential spokeswoman said Chirac went to the heart of
the issue during two hours and 40 minutes of talks, but failed to
get a ``precise response'' from Assad. Chirac planned to bring up
the case again at dinner, according to Catherine Colonna.
	   Brunner has been the object of a French judicial investigation
since 1988, and families of Holocaust victims protested Assad's
silence at a demonstration in front of the Syrian Embassy.
	   Chirac greeted Assad and an entourage of five ministers at Orly
airport with a fanfare welcome of Marines and martial music.
	   The pomp accorded Assad, the austere 67-year-old leader who
rarely travels abroad, was a sign of French hopes that the visit
will pay off with improved ties and trade and, more importantly,
with new impetus to the blocked Middle East peace process.
	   Chirac, who visited Damascus in 1996, has actively sought a
clear role for France, and Europe, in the peace process, and Assad,
who is seeking an alternative to American mediation, could provide
it.
	   During the dinner toast and in talks, Chirac pressed a
French-Egyptian proposal made in May for an international
conference to save the peace process.
	   While reiterating his support for American mediation, Chirac
said it is necessary to reflect on what to do ``in case the current
efforts halt.''
	   An international conference could end the impasse, Chirac said.
	   Assad apparently gave only a lukewarm response to the proposal.
Colonna said only that Assad ``did not refuse the idea.''
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said
the United States has been in touch with all sides, as well as
France, ``to see if there is a way we can restart the negotations
that have been suspended.''
	   He stressed the need for a ``comprehensive peace,'' a reference
to the Syrian and Lebanese aspects -- which Paris also stresses.

	   Netanyahu was criticized after Manbar's conviction last month
for saying he hoped the court would issue a stiff sentence.
	   Nissim Zvili, a legislator from the opposition Labor Party, on
Tuesday called for an investigation into allegations that Netanyahu
had discussed the case with Straschov and tried to influence him.
Zvili later withdrew the demand, saying he accepted the judge's
denial.
	   Netanyahu on Thursday accused the opposition of taking advantage
of the Manbar affair to raise ``baseless claims'' in order to
defame him and the integrity of Israel's justice system.
	   ``If I ever thought there was a limit to how low my opponents
were willing to go, it turns out I was wrong,'' he said.

Eyles wins opening match

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ World squash champion Rodney Eyles of
Australia had a shaky start to the defense of his Australian Open
title, dropping a game before winning his first-round match
Thursday night.
	   Eyles, ranked No. 4 in the world, held off countryman John
Williams 15-13, 15-13, 13-15, 15-9. It was the only men's match to
go to four games.
	   Eyles, 30, who is playing in his first tournament since the
British Open in April, said his main problem in early rounds is
concentration.
	   ``I enjoy tough games first up as long as I get through them,''
Eyles said. ``It was tight in those games, but I played the big
points well.''
	   In another first-round match, Jonathon Power of Canada beat
Australian Anthony Ricketts 15-7, 15-9, 15-6.
	   In play at the South Australian Women's Open being held at the
same venue _ the Thebarton Theater _ Michelle Martin beat fellow
Australian 9-3, 9-3, 9-0 and Carol Owens of Australia beat Laura
Hamilton of Scotland 9-1, 9-2, 9-2. (djp)

	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ As a boy, when Tiger Woods studied his
handmade chart of all that Jack Nicklaus accomplished, he must have
wondered what took him so long to win the British Open.
	   It started to sink in last year, when the nuances of links golf
took a toll on the 21-year-old Masters champion. On Thursday at
Royal Birkdale, Woods showed he learned his lessons well.
	   With play that was as steady as it was brilliant, Woods steered
clear of trouble for a 5-under-par 65, giving him a share of the
first-round lead with John Huston on an unusually warm, sunny day.
	   ``It's just one of those things where I think I learned to play
smart golf,'' said Woods, who hasn't been in the lead at a major
since winning at Augusta National last year.
	   Nick Price, the best player in the world from 1992 to 1994 when
he won three majors and nine PGA Tour events, finally made some
putts in his round of 66 that left him one stroke back, along with
Fred Couples and Loren Roberts.
	   Couples adjusted his game for the calmer winds off the Irish
Sea, then surged up the leader board by hitting fairways and holing
a 15-foot (4 1/2-meter) eagle putt on No. 15.
	   ``It really wasn't that hard if you kept the ball in play,''
Couples said. ``You're not going to shoot 66 out here every day,
but it gives me a chance to have a poor round.''
	   PGA champion Davis Love III, his first tournament since missing
the cut at the U.S. Open, was 3 under on the difficult back nine
and finished at 67, along with Brad Faxon, Vijay Singh, Robert
Allenby and Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson.
	   Twenty-seven players managed to break par on a day when a stiff
breeze cleared away the dark, drooping clouds over the Lancashire
coast but had only a marginal effect on club selection.
	   Huston followed nine straight pars with three birdies, all from
inside 12 feet. After his only bogey, from the bunker at the par-3
14th, Huston holed a 40-foot (12-meter) eagle putt on No. 17 and
then hacked a 7-iron out of the rough to within 4 feet (1.2 meters)
for birdie on the 18th.
	   ``Just to finish that way, obviously, is pretty pleasing,'' said
Huston, who earlier this year set the PGA Tour scoring record with
a 28-under 260 at the Hawaiian Open.
	   The awesome power of Woods was evident throughout, but he showed
so much more than length: the bump-and-run chips with a 7-iron to
save par; the feel out of the meadow rye rough the few times he
strayed from the fairway; the knowledge of when to pull the driver
from his bag.
	   ``It is just learning how to play golf,'' Woods said. ``I think
it's an evolution process that I think every player goes through.
I'm no exception to that.''
	   Woods was done in at Royal Troon last year by two double bogeys
and a triple bogey, finishing tied for 24th.
	   He flirted with trouble just twice at Birkdale, saving par twice
from the fairway rough. The second time came on the 16th hole, just
20 yards (18 meters) past a plaque that honors Arnold Palmer's
brilliant play from the rough in the final round of his 1961 Open
championship.
	   Woods' only two bogeys came on short putts that banged off the
back lip, the last one a 6-footer (1.8 meters) on the 18th hole
that kept him from equaling the 64 he shot in the third round last
year at Troon.
	   He also finally made some putts, something that has kept him to
only two wins in the past year. For that he could owe his best
friend on tour, Masters champion Mark O'Meara, who recently gave
him a new putter.
	   ``It's a little longer. I think it sets up for him a little
better,'' O'Meara said. ``Hopefully, if he continues to putt well,
I'll get a commission.''
	   Woods' advantage has always been his length. Realizing the rough
around the green on the ninth hole was not severe, Woods hit his
driver 24 yards (22 meters) from the front of the green to set up
an easy birdie.
	   The wind wasn't nearly as strong as it was earlier in the week,
when it frightened the field into believing a score of even par or
higher would be sufficient.
	   But that didn't keep everyone off the hook.
	   Defending champion Justin Leonard twice failed to get out of the
rough with a wedge and finished at 73. Tom Watson wound up in five
bunkers and also shot 73, along with Colin Montgomerie.
	   ``I'm in a pretty good hole here,'' Leonard said.
	   Ernie Els whiffed a wedge trying to get his ball out of the
mangled rough around the 480-yard (437-meter) sixth hole and took a
double bogey. He finished at 72, along with O'Meara, Nick Faldo and
U.S. Open champion Lee Janzen.
	   Lee Westwood was in a large group at 71. David Duval and Jim
Furyk, two others in the 20-something class looking for their first
major, were at 70.
	   Sergio Garcia, the 18-year-old amateur from Spain, shot 69. Matt
Kuchar managed more smiles in a rough round of 75.
	   Woods made the chart of Nicklaus' accomplishments with hopes of
matching them someday _ U.S. Amateur and NCAA champion, the 18
professional majors. Nicklaus won three of the four majors after
two full years as a pro, but didn't win a British Open until his
fifth year.
	   Watson, a five-time Open champion, all but guaranteed earlier
this week that Woods would win a Claret Jug in his career. Price
was paired with Woods in the first round, and was not one to argue
about his chances.
	   ``He's diligent enough to go out there and refine and round off
the rough edges,'' Price said. ``He's got so much talent. Just as
Jack Nicklaus and all the great players before him have done,
they've gotten better and better with age.''
	   Then he smiled, a combination of sarcasm and the frightful
thought of the Woods evolution.
	   ``By the time he gets to 30, he's going to be a pretty good
player.''
	   But there are sure to be other lessons along the way. And they
could start Friday, with a forecast of rain and stronger winds
capable of turning the 127th Open into a new test.

Prince Charles offers paintings to help save child prostitutes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS The Sun has sold all paintings grafs 8, 9

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles has offered limited edition prints
of one of his own watercolors to raise funds for a hostel in Nepal
which rescues girls from child prostitution, The Sun tabloid
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The prince hopes to raise more than 50,000 pounds (dlrs 82,000)
for the Maiti Nepal Hostel in Katmandu, Nepal, which he visited in
February.
	   ``This is something that he has never done before and is not
likely to be repeated,'' The Sun quoted an unnamed aide of the
prince's as saying.
	   Other watercolors by the prince, an amateur painter, have been
sold as lithographs to help raise money for his charitable trusts,
but a limited print run has never been made of one of his
watercolors, The Sun said.
	   In a personally signed letter published in The Sun, Prince
Charles told how he found the sufferings of the girls, rescued
mainly from brothels in Bombay, India after being lured there with
promises of jobs in carpet factories, ``grimmer and even more
heartbreaking than I could have imagined.''
	   He has agreed that 500 framed prints of a watercolor he painted
of a Himalayan mountain range while on a private trekking trip in
1992 can be sold as part of the appeal for funds for the hostel,
which offers a refuge for girls who have been sold into
prostitution.
	   The limited edition prints are on offer for 150 pounds (dlrs
245) each through the newspaper.
	   The Sun's night editor Alan Edwards said that within half an
hour of telephone lines opening at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT) Thursday
morning, over 500 readers had asked to order the watercolor. The
final buyers will be selected at random from those who phoned.
	   Edwards said that the total raised in the sale of the paintings,
minus tax, would equal 50,000 (dlrs 82,000). The newspaper also
included a separate telephone number for readers to offer donations
to add to the figure.
	   During the prince's visit earlier this year, he met many of the
girls saved by the hostel, run by Anuradha Koirala, 47.
	   ``The money you raise will dispel the chronic uncertainty of
their daily existence and make an immense and very real difference
to their lives,'' he told the newspaper's readers in the letter.
	   ``The girls' tale of abuse and exploitation were truly
appalling,'' he wrote. ``But there was, at the same time, a
heroism, a selfless dedication and sacrifice about Anuradha, who
was living under constant threat of retribution from the
traffickers, which I found both uplifting and humbling.''

 &UR; Chirac discusses Brunner case with Assad as Jewish groups protest &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ President Jacques Chirac raised the case of Alois
Brunner during talks Thursday with President Hafez Assad of Syria,
where the Nazi war criminal is said to be hiding out.
	   Families of Holocaust victims demonstrated in front of the
Syrian Embassy to protest the two-day state visit of the man they
say is harboring Brunner from French justice.
	   ``Shame to Assad Who Protects the Nazi Criminal Brunner'' read
one banner at the peaceful protest.
	   Chirac expressed France's wish ``that Syria, through legal
channels, answer the request of French justice,'' presidential
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna told reporters.
	   ``The French judge has reasons to believe that (Brunner) could
be found in Syria and asks that this point be verified,'' Colonna
said.
	   Assad failed to provide a ``precise response,'' she added, and
the issue was being addressed again at a state dinner.
	   Paris has requested permission for a French magistrate to go to
Syria to investigate the matter.
	   In 1988, Brunner, blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from
Germany, Austria, France and Greece, was placed under formal
investigation in France for crimes against humanity. He was
sentenced to death in absentia in France in 1954, when the death
penalty was still in place here.
	   Noted Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld is among those convinced that
Brunner, now 87, lives in Syria under the alias Georg Fischer.
	   ``He can't leave Syria. He's an old man,'' Klarsfeld said in a
telephone interview this week. ``He is of no interest to any
country.''
	   Klarsfeld said Chirac had asked Assad about Brunner during his
1996 visit to Damascus.
	   In a French television interview conducted this week and aired
Wednesday, the Syrian leader denied any knowledge of Brunner's
whereabouts.
	   ``If you know where he is, go immediately to his address to find
out whether or not he is there,'' Assad told TF1.
	   The arrival of Assad fell on the 56th anniversary of the ``Vel
d'Hiv roundup,'' named for a Paris cycling stadium where 13,152
Jews were detained July 16-17, 1942, by French police before being
sent to Nazi death camps. It was one of the worst acts of French
collaboration with the Nazi occupiers.

Serbian police raid ethnic Albanian headquarters in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a warning to separatists, Serb
police raided the headquarters of Kosovo's largest ethnic Albanian
party Thursday, moments after their self-styled parliament swore in
a president.
	   Fighting was reported for the first time, meanwhile, in a
strategic area south of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, where a
two-hour gunbattle raged between Serb security forces and Albanian
militants, Serb sources said.
	   Police seized documents at the office of the Democratic League
of Kosovo, moments after the province's self-proclaimed parliament
_ meeting for the first time _ swore in party leader Ibrahim Rugova
as president. There were no arrests during the half-hour operation.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin called the
raid ``emblematic of the repressive nature'' of Yugoslav rule in
Kosovo ``which sparked the current crisis'' in the rebellious
province.
	   ``Stripping away the legitimate rights of the Kosovar Albanian
people'' has ``radicalized the ... population,'' Rubin said, making
it more difficult to resolve the crisis in ``the interests of both
Yugoslavia and the people in Kosovo.''
	   Kosovo is in southern Serbia, the largest of Yugoslavia's two
republics.
	   The Serb police said the raid ``prevented an attempt to
constitute the so-called parliament of the Republic of Kosovo,''
whose members were elected March 22 in an unauthorized ballot. It
said the local prosecutor was considering filing criminal charges.
	   Still, the fact that police did not enter the building until
after Rugova was sworn in and the 20-minute session was over
suggested the government was not seriously attempting to muzzle
Rugova, considered the Albanian politician most capable of
conducting future peace talks with the Yugoslav government.
	   Rugova has called for an independent Kosovo, which the Americans
and Europeans oppose. Instead, they support autonomy for Kosovo, a
province of Serbia where Albanians make up 90 percent of the
population.
	   But despite his support for independence, Rugova's renunciation
of violence has made him more acceptable to the United States and
Europe as a negotiating partner than the militant Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Rugova's party holds 90 percent of the 120 seats in the
self-styled parliament, because most of the 15 other Albanian
parties boycotted the March vote.
	   ``The police action wasn't brutal, but it was very swift,''
Nekibe Kelmendi, the general secretary of Rugova's party, told
reporters. ``They gave us a two-minute ultimatum to hand them the
documents from the constitutional session, which we did.''
	   Kelmendi said the formation of the Kosovo parliament was ``a
historic act and the result of a new reality in the region which
the international community will have to consider.''
	   Although Rugova has international backing, his nonviolent stand
has cost him considerable support among the Albanian community _
angered by the five-month Serb crackdown on the KLA in which
hundreds have died.
	   Rugova apparently hoped that convening the parliament would
bolster his political stature, even if the Serb government never
permits it to function.
	   Meanwhile, Serb sources reported new clashes Thursday between
KLA fighters and security forces in several areas.
	   The Serb Media Center said a ``large group'' of Albanians
attacked a police patrol near Prizren, about 37 miles southwest of
Pristina and withdrew after a two-hour gunbattle. There were no
reports of casualties in the fighting, the first reported in the
Prizren area.
	   However, the Kosovo Information Center, close to Rugova's party,
said Serb police set fire to three Albanian homes near the town and
heavy gunfire could be heard in the area.
	   Serb sources also reported a KLA attack on a Serb patrol late
Thursday near Urosevac and one Albanian was killed. Urosevac
controls the main highway between Pristina and the Macedonian
capital, Skopje, and the fighting could signal a KLA attempt to
block a major transportation artery.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said Albanian fighters attacked a lead
and zinc mine 25 miles (40 kms) northwest of Pristina but were
driven off. Rebels control most of that area except for the mine
itself.
	   In their account of the mine clash, Albanian sources said police
shelled seven KLA-controlled villages in the area late Wednesday
but there were no casualties.
	   In the Albanian capital of Tirana, meanwhile, a young Kosovo man
armed with a knife was captured inside the downtown residence of
Premier Fatos Nano, an Interior Ministry source said Thursday.
	   The Kosovo Albanian, identified as 19-year-old Faruk Mazreku,
was stopped by bodyguards Tuesday night after entering the
residence through a back window, according to the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   No other details were available. The premier was not at home at
the time and nobody was hurt.
	   Mazreku was reported to be in police custody. The Albanian
intelligence service had launched an investigation.

Take Two for Titanic expedition

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) _ For the second time in two
years, Titanic explorers will try to coax the often cruel North
Atlantic to release its 86-year-old grip on a hunk of the hull of
the ill-fated oceanliner.
	   Discovery Channel Canada and RMS Titanic Inc. announced Thursday
they have joined together again for a month-long expedition to the
site off the coast of Newfoundland where Titanic hit an iceberg and
sank.
	   The high-tech salvage operation, which begins Aug. 5, is only
one part of a Canadian dlrs 7-million (U.S. dlrs 4.75 million)
event timed designed to cater to public fascination with the
Titanic following the Hollywood blockbuster.
	   On Aug. 16, Discovery will broadcast a two-hour program live
from the wreck, located about four kilometres (2.5 miles) below the
surface.
	   It will feature a close look at the bow, the bridge, and an
attempt to recover the ship's Marconi wireless transmitter.
	   In 1996, efforts to raise a section of the ship's hull measuring
6.5 by 4.0 metres (7.1 by 4.4 yards) failed when those involved
could not hoist the piece from the surface of the water and onto a
ship.
	   Knowing now that the actual weight of the piece is 19 tons, RMS
Titanic president George Tulloch said he is confident the salvage
operation will be successful.
	   ``We're more prepared this time because we've done it once
before,'' Tulloch said from New York.
	   The piece of the hull will be lifted to the surface using
diesel-filled bags.
	   It is to be brought to Boston for conservation before becoming
part of a museum exhibition somewhere in Europe or the United
States.
	   Scientists will also use new color digital still cameras to take
24,000 pictures of Titanic.
	   The 1996 expedition led researchers to conclude a series of
small slits, not a giant gash as many had long believed, ultimately
sank Titanic.
	   RMS Titanic Inc. was granted sole legal salvage rights to the
ship in 1994.
	   Ever since the wreck was discovered in 1985, there have been
critics who have said the site should be treated as an underwater
graveyard and left undisturbed.
	   Tulloch countered the criticism.
	   ``Is it smarter to leave these ships like critically ill
patients on the side of the road not to be cared for, or picked
over by the ravages of scavengers who would pick them clean of
things to sell at auctions?'' asked Tulloch. ``Or do people want to
see them cared for by the best scientists in a permanent
collection?''
	   More than 1,500 of the 2,200 passengers and crew aboard Titanic
died when the ship sank in the icy North Atlantic on April 15,
1912. Only five survivors are still alive.

Puerto Rico strike talks to resume Friday

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Workers protesting the
privatization of Puerto Rico's telephone company voted Thursday to
stay on strike until the government promises they won't be punished
for their walkout.
	   Delegates of the Independent Telephone Employees Union and the
Independent Brotherhood of Telephone Employees voted to support
union leaders who are demanding a no-firings pledge before calling
an end to the month-old strike.
	   Union negotiations with the government were to resume Friday.
	   Sanctions stand in the way of ending the strike, which was
called to protest the sale of Puerto Rico Telephone Co. to
investors led by GTE Corp. of Stamford, Connecticut.
	   Both unions want no reprisals against thousands of public sector
employees who staged a 48-hour general strike last week in support
of the 6,400 striking telephone workers.
	   Labor Secretary Cesar Almodovar, meanwhile, said the government
was demanding that the unions don't fine workers who crossed picket
lines during the strike, which began June 18.
	   The government also wants to prosecute any strikers who
sabotaged telephone company property, affecting thousands of
customers.
	   GTE said Thursday it had submitted an ``enhanced offer'' to
acquire a controlling interest in Puerto Rico Telephone, made in
response to an 11th-hour bid by Spain's Telefonica Internacional
S.A.
	   In a complex financing arrangement, the consortium led by GTE
originally offered dlrs 1.875 billion for 50 percent plus one share
of the company. It also offered a one-year job guarantee for
current employees.
	   Telefonica hasn't released its bid, although local, unconfirmed
reports put it at roughly dlrs 2 billion for 50 percent of the
company and dlrs 2.125 billion for 60 percent.
	   GTE spokeswoman Sharon Cohen-Hagar refused to provide details on
the new offer. ``We believe that our offer is superior in every way
to TISA's,'' she said.
	   Although Gov. Pedro Rossello has signed into law legislation
authorizing the GTE-led purchase, the contract allows the
government to consider competing bids while the deal is reviewed by
U.S. federal agencies.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Police are investigating what is
believed to be the Dutch arm of an international child pornography
ring that has sexually abused children as young as 12 months and
spread digital images of the abuse on the Internet.
	   Computer material gathered last month by police from an
apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort contained ``a number of
images of very serious sexual abuse of children,'' police spokesman
Hans Vos said Thursday.
	   Vos added that it would take weeks for police to sift through
all the digital images they had found.
	   Respected Dutch current affairs program NOVA reported Wednesday
it had obtained computer disks containing thousands of ``very
shocking'' photographs of children being abused. One Dutch child
psychologist told NOVA the material was the worst he had ever seen,
involving children aged between 12 and 15 months.
	   ``The people who did this must feel the full force of the law,''
Germany's minister for family and youth, Claudia Nolte, said in
Bonn, where the bust was also publicized.
	   She said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has increased
penalties against the distribution of pornographic images.
	   ``The Internet is not a lawless space,'' she said.
	   Vos said Dutch police had been in ``intensive contact'' with
German and Belgian police, but added that Dutch investigators have
not yet discovered where the ring was based or its size. Some
members reportedly come from Berlin.
	   A Belgian anti-child pornography group called Morkhoven also has
material from the Zandvoort flat but has not yet turned it over to
Dutch investigators, instead giving it to NOVA reporters.
	   The group came across the images when it was trying to trace a
missing German child believed to have been abducted and abused for
child pornography, according to the German newspaper Berliner
Morgenpost.
	   The child, Manuel Schadwald, disappeared at the age of 12 in
1993 and was later reportedly seen in bordellos in Amsterdam and
Rotterdam, Berliner Morgenpost reported.
	   The owner of the Zandvoort apartment, a 49-year-old German
identified as Gert-Jan Ulrich, was recently murdered in Italy by a
suspected fellow gang member, apparently because he had tipped off
police about the ring's activities, Dutch media reported Thursday.
	   Members of Ulrich's family led police to his apartment where the
pornography was found, Vos said.
	   Jacqueline Hemmes-Boender, a spokeswoman with Haarlem public
prosecutor's office, said police have one suspect but that he
cannot immediately be arrested. That led to speculation the suspect
is Ulrich's suspected killer, who is reportedly in custody in Italy
awaiting trial.
	   Dutch authorities have not yet requested extradition of the man,
a Belgian whose identity was not released.

UN chief says council should consider Macedonia troop increase
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to UPDATE with council sources saying increase expected
to pass, INSERTS that original force was at 1,100 &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Concerned that violence in Kosovo could
cross the border, U.N. chief Kofi Annan recommended Thursday that
the Security Council consider increasing the 750-strong U.N.
peacekeeping force for Macedonia by another 350 troops.
	   Diplomatic sources, citing the tension in the region, said the
proposal was expected to be endorsed by the 15-member council, even
though the recommendation exceeded an earlier estimate of 300 new
peacekeepers.
	   The majority of the new troops, 230, would be deployed at nine
new observation posts along the Kosovo and Albanian borders, Annan
said in a report to the council.
	   In addition, a reserve group of about 60 soldiers in two
platoons would patrol the ground and air. The council should also
consider increasing the number of military observers and civilian
police by 12 and 24 respectively, Annan wrote.
	   The recommendation comes as diplomatic efforts have intensified
to try to stop the violence between ethnic Albanian separatists in
Kosovo and troops from Serb-led Yugoslavia. Hundreds have been
killed since a Serb crackdown in Kosovo began in February.
	   ``Recent developments in Kosovo have highlighted the danger of
renewed violence in the area and the serious repercussions such
violence could have upon the external and internal security of the
Republic,'' of Macedonia, Annan wrote.
	   He repeated his recommendation that the mandate of the current
750 U.N. troops _ including nearly 340 Americans _ be extended for
another six months, until Feb. 28.
	   Those troops, which had numbered 1,100 until last year, were
sent to Macedonia in 1992 to prevent the spread of the ethnic
conflict in other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
	   In a July 9 letter, Macedonian Foreign Minister Blagoj
Handzinski endorsed Annan's recommendation for an extended mandate
as well as the option of a greater troop presence.
	   Annan said he would give the council a cost estimate once they
agreed to the increases. He noted that any increase in the size of
the U.N. force could be accompanied by an even greater
international military buildup.
	   ``Discussions are still continuing at the international level on
the possible need for an expanded international military presence
in the region and on the establishment of a comprehensive
monitoring regime as a consequence of the situation in Kosovo,'' he
wrote.
	   The U.N. operation, formally known as the United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force, includes troops from six nations. They
are Denmark, Finland, Indonesia, Norway and Sweden in addition to
the United States.

State-run train system scores modest victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The French soccer team wasn't the only winner of
soccer's World Cup. France's state-run railway company said
Thursday that the soccer championships brought in nearly 50 million
francs (dlrs 8.3 million) in added revenue.
	   The SNCF, as the rail system is known, added 400 special World
Cup trains to those already scheduled in order to ferry fans from
one venue to another during the month-long tournament.
	   Conductors announced the game scores so that fans could follow
matches while in transit. Announcements were made at stations in
the languages of most of the countries represented at the
tournament and extra interpreters were hired.
	   Speaking to reporters, SNCF President Louis Gallois said that
the World Cup had been positive for the rail operator's image and
would help the company in its growing European operations.
	   ``We have a European dimension; our trains no longer stop at the
French border,'' making image important, Gallois said.
	   SNCF's victory over costs wasn't as dramatic as the French
team's win over Brazil. Still, said Gallois, World Cup revenues
will boost profits by 1 million francs (about dlrs 166,600) to 5
million francs (dlrs 833,300).
	   The rail authority posted a net loss of 959 million francs (dlrs
159.8 million) in 1997.

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ When the 22-foot (6.6-meter) birdie
putt curved gently right to left and dropped dead into the hole,
Nick Price couldn't wait for a greenside celebration.
	   ``Surprise, surprise,'' a delighted Price said to caddie Jimmy
Johnson at the par-4 fifth.
	   ``No surprise,'' Johnson replied.
	   The putting woes that have plagued Price for years faded away
for at least one beautiful summer day at Royal Birkdale on
Thursday. He shot a 4-under 66 that left him a stroke behind
playing partner Tiger Woods and John Huston after the first round
of the British Open.
	   The putts that never went in during the last round of the U.S.
Open, when Price was in contention, dropped in the center of the
cup to give him a chance at a second Open title to go with his two
PGA championships.
	   ``When I putt well, I have a good chance to win,'' Price said.
``I made a couple of good putts. I'm happy. What more can I say?''
	   Price, who shot 73 on the final day at the U.S. Open to finish
fourth, overcame a shaky start to miss only one green over the last
17 holes in a round of six birdies and two bogeys.
	   Bad club selection cost him a bogey on the first hole, when a
5-iron finished well short, and again at 10 when a 6-iron was hit
through the green.
	   But every other shot was rock solid, and good putting made up
for the rest.
	   Before making his putt on the fifth hole, Price sank a 15-footer
(4 1/2 meters) on No. 3. He added a 12-footer (3 1/2 meters) on the
par-4 8th, then made a 20-footer (6 meters) for birdie on 12. A
pair of two-putt birdies on the par-5 15th and 17th holes completed
the round.
	   Price, who changes putters nearly as often as he changes socks,
was using a new face-balanced putter that may have helped. Also
helping were the hours of putting practice at his Florida home
since the U.S. Open.
	   Still, Price admitted, he had little idea that he would come out
in the first round and actually make some putts.
	   ``Putting is such a fickle thing, I think it's a science, a game
within a game,'' he said.
	   Price's first Open win came in 1994 at Turnberry when he shot
four rounds in the 60s for a 12-under performance. He was the
runner-up in 1982 and again in 1988 and won the PGA Championship in
1992 and 1994.
	   Still, the South African battles for recognition, even at home
in Hobe Sound, Fla., where his neighbor and close friend is Greg
Norman.
	   ``My kids still think Greg Norman is a better golfer than I
am,'' Price said.
	   Not this week he isn't, with Norman recovering from shoulder
surgery. Instead of Norman, Price must contend with Woods, whom he
will play with again on Friday.
	   ``He's learning every year,'' Price said of Woods. ``He is
diligent enough to go out there and refine and round off the rough
edges.''
	   And Price's assessment of his own game at the age of 40?
	   ``I still love playing the game, so it's fun,'' he said. ``If I
could get to putt like I did from that spell from '92 through '94,
I would have probably won a couple of tournaments this year.''

Appeals court reinstates jury award for Mike Tyson's trainer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LARRY NEUMEISTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A federal appeals court Thursday reinstated a
dlrs 4.4 million award that a jury decided boxer Mike Tyson owes
former trainer Kevin Rooney for unjustly firing him.
	   ``We feel we won a tremendous victory,'' Rooney's lawyer,
Michael Coyle, said after speaking by phone with Rooney, who was in
England training another boxer. ``We're both overjoyed with it.
We've been vindicated.''
	   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based its ruling on the
findings of a New York Court of Appeals' review of an oral contract
in which Tyson agreed to keep Rooney as his trainer ``for as long
as the boxer fights professionally.''
	   The federal court had looked to the state court for guidance on
state contract law.
	   Tyson's lawyer, Lawrence Weinstein, did not immediately return a
telephone call for comment.
	   Coyle said his client will be entitled to dlrs 7.6 million when
interest is added to the jury award.
	   In addition, Rooney will seek another dlrs 20 million in
post-trial motions that the federal appeals court said must now be
considered in Albany by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas McAvoy.
	   McAvoy presided over a September 1996 trial in which a jury
awarded more than dlrs 4.4 million to Rooney, who had sued Tyson
for dlrs 49 million.
	   The judge later tossed out the award, saying it was improper
because Rooney failed to prove Tyson had a contract with him.
	   Rooney trained the former heavyweight champion for the first 35
fights of his career, but was fired in 1988. Tyson later said he
became angry about the trainer's public comments about his
then-marriage to actress Robin Givens and a contract dispute with
ex-manager Bill Cayton.
	   During the 1996 trial, lawyers for Tyson said Rooney was paid
more than dlrs 4 million for training Tyson. In 1992, Rooney's
petition for bankruptcy protection was approved. He owed more than
dlrs 1 million to the Internal Revenue Service and to casinos owned
by Donald Trump. He listed his lawsuit against Tyson as a potential
asset.

El Guerrouj just fails in bid to break mile record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FRANCOIS BLANC &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Hicham El Guerrouj of Morocco Thursday
failed to break the mile world record that has been held for five
years by middle-distance great Noureddine Morceli.
	   Running at the Nikaia meeting in Nice, El Guerrouj clocked a
time of three minutes, 44.60 seconds, slower than the 3:44.39
posted in September 1993 by Algeria's Morceli.
	   Morceli was due to compete in the race, but pulled out Thursday
afternoon, leaving El-Guerrouj to battle against the clock.
	   El Guerrouj was looking to set his second world record of the
week.
	   On Tuesday, he smashed the 1,500 meters all-time best at the
Golden Gala meet in Rome, with a time of 3:26.
	   That knocked more than a second off the old mark of 3:27.37, set
by Morceli in 1995.
	   But the Moroccan failed to make it a famous double on Thursday.
	   With Kenyan Bernard Kisilu and Driss Maazouzi of France acting
as pacesetters, El Guerrouj looked on track to break the record
till the end, but one final acceleration was not enough to break
the record.
	   El Guerrouj had the consolation of recording the second fastest
time in history for the mile.
	   ``I was a little tired after Rome,'' El Guerrouj said after the
race.''
	   Among other good performances were those by Javier Sotomayor of
Cuba in the high jump and Zahra Ouaziz of Morocco in the women's
3,000 meters.
	   Other winners at the Nice meeting included Kim Batten in the
women's 400 meter hurdles, Melissa Morrison in the 100 meter
women's hurdles and Bernard Barmasai in the steeplechase.
	   Sotomayor recorded the best high jump of the year, two meters,
34 centimeters.
	   In an exciting women's 3,000, Ouaziz and Ireland's Sonia
O'Sullivan, both well ahead of the pack, exchanged the lead three
times in the last lap before Ouaziz won with a time of 8:28.66 -
the best performance by any runner this year and an all time
African record.
	   ``I was running to win and not to beat a record,'' Ouaziz said.
``My calf hurt really badly after the 5,000 meters in Rome. I
stayed behind O'Sullivan at first so that she couldn't beat my
record of best performance this year, then I beat her at the end.''
	   In the women's 400 hurdles, world record holder Batten of the
United States had no trouble crossing the line first, posting a
time of 53.17.
	   ``I feel good about my season so far. I'm fast early on so it's
a good sign. I'm hoping for some even better times later. I
concentrated on endurance last fall and will now work on the
technical aspects of my race,'' Batten said.
	   In the women's 100 hurdle, runner up Brigita Bukovec of Slovenia
was happier than winner Morrison.
	   ``I'm not very happy,'' Morrison said. ``The wind didn't help
and I found it quite difficult. My season has been good on the
whole. The goal for this season is the Goodwill Games where I am
running next Monday.''
	   Bukovec, who has just recovered from a back injury, was in
better spirits.
	   ``This race went well for me and I'm pleased with the result. It
is difficult for me at the moment. This race is my second good one
this season and I'm coming back after an injury.''
	   A superb steeplechase run by Bernard Barmasai of Kenya, the
world record holder, was another highlight of the meeting.
	   Barmasi, more than 100 meters ahead of the field, ran powerfully
throughout the race to finish in 8:01.54, and received a warm
ovation from the crowd for his efforts.
	   In the 400 hurdles, 1997 World Champion Stephane Diagana of
France was beaten into seventh place, well behind winner Dinsdale
Morgan of Jamaica.
	   Morgan, who came seventh in the Athens World Championship, won
easily in a time of 48.51, ahead of Rusian Mashchenko of Russia in
second.
	   ``I can't say that I am surprised to have won the race, each
time I enter the race it is to win it,'' Morgan said.
	   At the end of the meeting, Dimitri Markov of Bulgaria, Russia's
Maxim Tarasov and Jeff Hartwig of the United States each attempted
- and failed - to leap six meters in the pole vault.
	   Markov won with a jump of 5.95.

Argentine opposition angered by President Menem's wish for third
</HEADLINE>
term &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Opposition parties harshly
criticized President Carlos Menem on Thursday after he made his
strongest statement to date that he wants to run for a third
straight time.
	   Despite a constitutional limit of two consecutive terms, Menem
said late Wednesday he would like to be a candidate for his
Peronist party in the 1999 election _ something his aides hinted at
for months.
	   ``I'm going to consult with the Peronist delegates on Friday to
see what I have to do to present myself as a candidate for 1999,''
Menem told the Argentine network Todos Noticias.
	   Menem was elected in 1989 for a single six-year term. After the
constitution was amended in 1994, Menem was allowed to run for a
second four-year term. For months, Menem supporters have been
talking about amending the constitution again to allow a third term
or asking the Supreme Court to declare the two-term limit
unconstitutional.
	   The Supreme Court said Wednesday it has not considered the issue
and had not ``established a date to do it.''
	   For months, while Menem said little of re-election, his top
aides frequently talked of a possible third candidacy, spurring
intense infighting within the president's Peronist party.
	   Opposition hopefuls for 1999 accuse the president of seeking
ways to circumvent the law to stay in power.
	   ``Leave aside your personal ambitions and respect the law and
preserve Argentina's institutions,'' the centrist Radical Civic
Union, the leading opposition party, said in a statement Thursday.
	   The Radicals, along with the left-leaning Frepaso party, make up
the Alliance coalition, which has vowed to challenge Menem in 1999.
	   ``He is convinced he is the only one able to govern,'' said
Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a Frepaso deputy and 1999 hopeful.
	   In recent weeks, Menem's aides have begun to push for
demonstrations of popular support on his behalf. The governor of
Menem's hometown province of La Rioja recently called for a
referendum to test his re-election chances.
	   Eduardo Duhalde, governor of the Buenos Aires province and
Menem's chief Peronist rival, quickly countered by announcing plans
for a Sept. 13 non-binding referendum of his own in Argentina's
largest province.
	   Menem is considered less popular in the province, home to 8
million voters.
	   The Menem-Duhalde rivalry has produced a flurry of
behind-the-scenes politicking ahead of a national Peronist
convention scheduled for Friday _ an opportnity for Menem to gather
re-election support.
	   The uproar over re-election has overshadowed much-needed
legislative work on tax and labor reforms.
	   Carlos Rodriguez, a deputy economics minister, warned in a
newspaper interview that talk of amending the constitution could
tarnish the country's image abroad, particularly in the eyes of
investors. Local media later reported he would be resigning.
	   Menem is credited with turning around Argentina's economy, but
continued high unemployment, reported Thursday at 13.2 percent, has
hurt his popularity at home.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC;

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ As they prepare to commemorate their
1979 victory in Nicaragua, the Sandinistas are troubled by an
internal feud which only ``provokes the happiness and satisfaction
of our enemies,'' a veteran leader said Thursday.
	   Tomas Borge, former interior minister under the Sandinista
administration, urged party members to make brotherhood a central
point of Sunday's celebration of the anniversary of the former
rebel movement's ouster of the Somoza regime on July 19, 1979.
	   The leftist Sandinista Front, which led the government from 1979
to 1989, has become divided along generational lines. Many young
militants trying to push out the old guard, blaming them for
destroying the party's image.
	   Party leader and former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega lost
his 1990 and 1996 attempts to reclaim the nation's top office. He
also has faced criticism since his stepdaughter declared in April
that he sexually abused her. Ortega says the allegation is
politically motivated.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Guatemala's first ambassador to
Cuba in more than three decades will work to overcome the nations'
Cold War differences, Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein
said Thursday.
	   Guatemala named Willi Kaltschmitt as the new envoy on Monday,
reopening a post that had closed when the Central American country
broke diplomatic relations with Havana in 1961.
	   Guatemala, long governed by pro-U.S., conservative regimes,
reestablished ties with Cuba in January.
	   ``We want to recover the time lost to distortions in which both
our governments were pushed to the sidelines by the Cold War,''
Stein said during a visit to San Salvador.
	   Stein said Guatemala's vice president will visit Cuba in
September accompanied by 60 Guatemalan businessmen.
	   In the 1960s, Guatemalan territory was used to train anti-Cuban
rebels, while Cuba provided training for leftist Guatemalan
guerrillas.
	   ``We have put that page behind us because we consider it part of
a past which we should overcome,'' Stein said.
	   ___
	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Costa Rica on Thursday accused the
Nicaraguan army of preventing Costa Rican police from patrolling
the San Juan River, which marks the border between the two
countries.
	   Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas said Nicaraguan troops blocked
Costa Rican police boats trying to patrol the river.
	   A few small stretches of the river have been contested by both
sides for more than a century. But the disputed area has frequently
been used by Nicaraguan illegal immigrants entering Costa Rica in
search of temporary work.
	   ___
	   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) _ Foreign ministers from Central
America and Mexico reviewed an accord on regional cooperation
Thursday, a day before the nations' leaders gather in El Salvador
to sign the document.
	   The foreign ministers signaled that they hope the Tuxtla III
conference will strengthen international ties, specifically by
improving commercial opportunities with Mexico.
	   ``We will present, in the sparest terms, the route of decisions
to put into effect a free trade agreement between Honduras, El
Salvador and Guatemala with Mexico,'' Guatemalan Foreign Minister
Eduardo Stein said.
	   Stein said an accord between the three Central American nations
_ known as the Northern Triangle _ and Mexico will create
conformity with other agreements Guatemala already has with
Nicaragua and Costa Rica.
	   The regional leaders plan to discuss political and economic
development, as well as mutual approaches to migration and drug
trafficking.
	   The meeting of leaders from Mexico, Guatemala, Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Belize and Panama follows two
previous conferences: the first in 1991 in Mexico's Chiapas state
and the second in 1996 in Costa Rica.

Faldo's temper gone; maybe golf game, too
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM LITKE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ His temper is gone. Maybe his golf
game, too.
	   Nick Faldo used to own the British Open the way few men have
owned this tournament during the 130 or so years it's been played.
But not any more.
	   He used to be a bettor's dream. Six years ago, you could put a
few quid on Faldo at the bookmaker, put him on the first tee
anywhere in the British Isles in the middle of July, then go out
and use the betting slip as collateral on a bar tab in any pub with
100 miles (160 kilometers). But he's no longer dependable enough to
do that.
	   Faldo used to be miserable in public, but great copy. He was the
least-liked player among his peers, a stuffy, stomping, scowling,
hissing, cursing, mechanical man who, it seemed, was always in the
stormy phase of one marriage or another.
	   The last time the Open was at Royal Birkdale, in 1991, the
headline on the back page of one of the tabloids greeted him
thusly: ``Nick is a Nasty S.O.B.'' But the most controversial
reference to him in the papers when the tournament got under way
Thursday was this joke:
	   Question: ``What do a moped and Nick Faldo have in common?''
	   Answer: ``They both go putt-putt-putt.''
	   That is the popular version of what went wrong with Faldo, what
caused him to plummet from the top-ranked player in the world in
the early 1990s to No. 50 today. That he simply lost his ability to
putt.
	   According to this version, on the final day of the 1996 Open,
playing at Royal Lytham in the final pairing against Tom Lehman,
Faldo missed four birdies inside 7 feet (2 meters) and never found
his putting touch again. Soon after, he not only missed birdie
tries to contend; he started three-jacking too many par tries to
cash decent checks.
	   True or not, that was the version Faldo stuck to Thursday after
shooting a 2-over-par 72 in the opening round.
	   ``Didn't hit the ball badly,'' he said, briskly walking past a
pack of reporters waiting for him. ``I need a putt.''
	   Rude as that seemed, a consensus quickly emerged that his
behavior was still a considerable improvement over the championship
years, 1987-92, when Faldo won all three of his Opens and two of
his three Masters.
	   ``I wouldn't call him Mr. Congeniality _ yet,'' said David
Ledbetter, who became golf's premier swing guru due to his success
with Faldo. ``But I suppose it's fair to say he is a little nicer.
	   ``Part of that, I think, is only natural. When we get older,
Nick included. we look at life differently. We have different
responsibilities, different needs, different priorities.''
	   There you have popular version No. 2 of what caused Faldo's
fall, what caused the slide from the most-feared golfer in the
majors to a distant signpost that the Frankie Minozas (ranked No.
44) pass on their way toward the top. He lost his edge.
	   At the beginning of 1995, Faldo moved his base from England to
Florida, saying it was ``the start of a new me.'' The move wasn't
the only thing new. Shortly after the Ryder Cup that September, he
went through a very public split with his second wife, Gill, and
soon after took up with Brenna Cepelak, a University of Arizona
student.
	   They have been together since. In that time, Faldo won the
Masters and the L.A. Open. By most golfers' standards, that
wouldn't be a bad couple years. By Faldo's standards, that has been
a disaster.
	   Throughout his career, he missed the cut only seven times in 65
majors. Four of those misses, however, have come in his last six
tries. Yet he appears to be enjoying himself _ on and off the golf
course _ more than ever.
	   Now, the unsmiling fairways-and-greens machine has become golf's
version of Mr. Wipple. Before teeing off at the 177-yard
(161-meter), par-3 seventh, Faldo took several practice swings,
stopped to check his backswing position, and found a constable in
his field of view.
	   The old Faldo would have had his tough-talking caddy, Fanny
Sunesson, launch the policeman off the tee. The new Faldo said
pleasantly, `Sorry, Old Bill,'' and with a wave of his hand, gently
suggested the constable relocate behind him.
	   Then he dumped the ball into a greenside bunker, failed to get
it out on his first try, knocked his second to 5 feet (1.5 meters),
made the bogey putt and moved on. And the miracle of it all was
that as he walked off the green he was actually smiling.

Courier wants fans to be loud
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK LOWENKRON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Jim Courier wants fans of the U.S. Davis Cup
team to get rowdy during this weekend's match against Belgium.
	   Courier, who never has played on a losing U.S. team in 11 Davis
Cup series, has seen many loud fans cheer on teams from South
America and Europe when they've played on their home soil.
	   ``The potential problem here is fans are not aware of what Davis
Cup is like in those places, and what it can be like for us, the
players,'' Courier said Thursday. ``It's a real intense experience
when you're playing in South America and southern Europe where the
fans are very passionate.
	   ``We played in Brazil a few years ago, and you almost fear for
your life, it is so intense.''
	   Courier will play the opening match Friday against Filip Dewulf.
	   ``The fans here don't have to make the other players fear for
their life, only that they know we're in America, and they're
(playing) on foreign soil,'' he said. ``I think it is important
that they get behind us and give us their energy.''
	   The United States already appears to have everything in its
favor _ experience and surface. Courier and Andre Agassi, who will
play Christophe Van Garsse in Friday's other singles match, both
have been ranked No. 1 in the world. Dewulf is the highest ranked
player on the Belgium team at No. 43 and never has been higher than
39.
	   The match is being played on hardcourts, the surface where the
U.S. team learned to play the game. Belgium's players come from a
clay background and have had little success on hardcourts.
	   Belgium's hopes will depend heavily on Dewulf, who also will
play doubles with 17-year-old Xavier Malisse. The two never have
played together and will face Todd Martin and Richey Reneberg on
Saturday.
	   Courier has been struggling and is 11-13 this year after losing
five of his last six matches. His victories include a dramatic
comeback over Russia's Marat Safin in the decisive fifth match of
the opening Davis Cup round in April. The 3-2 triumph was the 17th
straight on U.S. soil by the United States.
	   Meanwhile, at Hamburg, Germany, defending champion Sweden is
favored against a young German team.
	   The Swedes are led by Jonas Bjorkman, the world's ninth-ranked
player, and Thomas Enqvist, No. 18. The Germans are relying on
inexperienced Nicolas Kiefer and Tommy Haas.
	   But the Germans, three-time champions, also have three-time
Wimbledon titlist Boris Becker.
	   Becker, now the head of the Davis Cup team, could insert himself
into Sunday's singles if his two young proteges falter. The former
world No. 1, easing into retirement, reached last week's Swiss Open
final.
	   Bjorkman will face Haas in the first singles, then Kiefer will
play Enqvist. In Saturday's doubles, Becker and David Prinosil meet
Nicklas Kulti and Enqvist.
	   Italy, banking on the surprising Davide Sanguinetti, faces the
Black brothers of Zimbabwe in a quarterfinal match on clay at
Prato, Italy.
	   Italy's top-ranked player, Andrew Gaudenzi, will meet Wayne
Black in Friday's opening singles. Sanguinetti, ranked No. 56 in
the world but a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon, will follow against
Byron Black.
	   In Saturday's doubles, Gaudenzi will team with Diego Nargiso
against the Black brothers.
	   At Coruna, Spain, the Spanish team will be trying to reach the
semifinals after an 11-year drought when it faces Switzerland on
clay.
	   Spain will be led by Carlos Moya, the world's No. 4 player.
	   Moya, the French Open champion, will face Ivo Heuberger in the
first singles match Friday, followed by Alex Corretja, who is
ranked No. 7 and is fresh off winning the Swiss Open, against Marc
Rosset.

Zanardi on a tear heading into Toronto
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Motorsports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Can Alex Zanardi be stopped?
	   Probably not say the rest of the CART FedEx Championship Series
contenders.
	   Zanardi, who likely will return to Formula One next season after
a scintillating three years racing Champ cars, has a 59-point lead
over Canadian Greg Moore heading into Friday's provisional
qualifying for the Toronto Molson-Indy.
	   The Italian has won five times, including the last three, in the
first 10 races this season.
	   ``They sure seem to have everything going for them,'' Moore
said. ``Everybody else has fallen behind because of a bunch of
problems, and he just keeps winning.''
	   It's true that Zanardi, one of the most aggressive drivers in
the series, has had fewer problems than anyone else.
	   Moore has nearly fallen out of contention for the PPG Cup title
by crashing early in the last two races. Last month at Portland, he
crashed on the start, taking out several other drivers, and was put
on probation for taking an unjustified risk.
	   Last Sunday at Cleveland, Moore spun early in the race and was
clipped by three other cars, knocking all of them out of action.
	   ``With nine races left in the season, there's no way we're going
to quit,'' Moore said. ``A win in Toronto would give us a big
boost. But I've got to admit that Alex is in an awfully good
position for this early in the year.''
	   Zanardi, who has two straight runner-up finishes on the
1.721-mile (2.734 kmph) temporary circuit at the Canadian National
Exhibition grounds, is in position to set a CART record with a
fourth consecutive victory.
	   ``I'm looking for my first victory in Canada and, right now, our
team has so much confidence that it's fun to get to each track and
push for a top finish,'' Zanardi said.
	   Mark Blundell was the driver who beat Zanardi at Toronto last
year.
	   ``It was my best race of the season, and one of the best of my
career,'' the Englishman said. ``It's one thing to lead from start
to finish, and another thing entirely to do it with a guy like Alex
Zanardi breathing down your neck. That made winning even sweeter.
	   ``But there's not much question that right now he's the guy to
beat, and nobody seems able to do it.''
	   Only Zanardi and Al Unser Jr. have won as many as three in a
row, and each has done it more than once.
	   Zanardi managed the feat last year when he won at Michigan
Speedway, Mid-Ohio and Road America before a fourth-place finish at
Vancouver ended the string.
	   Unser, who has 31 victories but hasn't won since the Vancouver
race in 1995, has won three in a row three times _ in 1990 and
twice in 1994.
	   The two-time series champion has been erratic this season, but
his showing at Cleveland was promising.
	   Despite being hit by Paul Tracy following an early pit stop,
Unser charged back from 20th to fifth before his gearbox gave up
late in the race.
	   ``We're knocking on the door,'' said Unser, who is hoping to
give team-owner Roger Penske his 100th Champ car win. ``Maybe we
can give Zanardi and his guys something to think about this
weekend.''

Hammel holds first-round lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM O'CONNELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, New York (AP) _ It took six birdies and an eagle
for Penny Hammel to steal the spotlight from Se Ri Pak and Nancy
Lopez.
	   Hammel had a 7-under-par 64 Thursday to take a three-shot lead
over five others after the first round of the JAL Big Apple
Classic.
	   The bulk of the attention in the days leading to the tournament
went to Pak, the rookie looking for her third tournament victory in
as many weeks, and Lopez, who is celebrating the 20th anniversary
of her record rookie season.
	   The two were grouped together Thursday and Lopez, who has missed
three straight cuts, shot a 68, while Pak struggled with her
putting and finished with a 1-over 72.
	   ``It was fun,'' Lopez said of the group that easily had the
largest following on the 6,161-yard (5,606-meter) Wykagyl Country
Club course. ``You have the galleries pulling for their favorite
but everyone was very polite.''
	   Hammel may not have had a lot of people watching her, but she
was the talk of the course after her round that was one shot off
the tournament record set by Betsy King in 1990 when it played to a
par of 72. It tied the lowest round since the par was dropped to
71, matching Juli Inkster in 1992 and Michele Redman last year,
both of whom went on to win the tournament.
	   Hammel, a four-time tour winner including last year in the
Rochester International, had four birdies from Nos. 6 through 10.
She bogeyed 13 but made up for that with an eagle on 15 and a
birdie on 16.
	   ``I have been hitting the ball well but not scoring great,''
Hammel said of a year that has seen her finish in the top 10 once
and break 70 just five times. ``I came in not expecting anything
and I still don't. I'm going to enjoy today. Three more days is a
lot of golf.''
	   Annika Sorenstam, a two-time winner this year; Juli Inskter, who
is 12th on the money list; and Tina Barrett were tied at 67 along
with Val Skinner and Mardi Lunn, 90th and 99th, respectively, on
the earnings list.
	   Sorenstam, who was second in this tournament last year, had six
birdies in her round and it could have been more had she not missed
birdie putts of eight feet (2.4 meters) or less on the first three
holes.
	   ``Coming off a week off it was nice to get in with a round like
this,'' said Sorenstam, who won six tournaments and set the money
record last year with over dlrs 1.2 million.
	   Pak, the leading money-winner this year, won the U.S. Women's
Open in a 20-hole playoff then won the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic
last week with a record 23-under total that included a record round
of 61. She wasn't that upset after Thursday's 71 and Lopez had a
lot to do with that.
	   ``I didn't play well but I am happy I saw her play well so I am
still happy,'' said Pak, who said her goal is to be like Nancy
Lopez, on and off the course. ``She is like a big sister. She is a
comfortable person.''
	   Lopez, whose four birdies were all on putts of about five feet
(1.5 meters), admitted her relationship with Pak has helped them
both.
	   ``This week I feel so much better mentally,'' said Lopez, one of
12 players at 3-under. ``I felt pretty calm, not disgusted like I
did after the Open and even last week.''
	   In 1978, Lopez won nine tournaments, including a record five in
a row.
	   ``Being with Se Ri reminds me of 20 years ago a lot,'' she said.
``Everyone wants a picture or an autograph. I know I finally felt
free when I got inside the ropes and I think Se Ri does as well.''

Jordan says he won't play for young coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RICK GANO &QC;

<TEXT>
	   LONG GROVE, Illinois (AP) _ Michael Jordan stopped short of
announcing his retirement Thursday, reiterating that he wouldn't
play for any coach other than Phil Jackson, who left the Chicago
Bulls last month.
	   Jordan said he wouldn't make an official announcement about his
status with the Bulls until after the NBA's lockout ends. He also
said he wouldn't play for a college coach or a young coach like
Iowa State's Tim Floyd, who is the leading candidate to replace
Jackson.

	   ``I'll wait until the situation (lockout) gets settled, making
sure in my mind,'' said Jordan, who talked to reporters after
playing in a pro-am golf tournament.
	   ``I feel that way right now. Ask me in two or three months and I
may change. I don't think I will. I'm pretty sure that's my
decision.''
	   Bulls chairman Jerry Reinsdorf said Wednesday he talked to
Jordan about the coaching candidates before the lockout began. But
Reinsdorf said he wouldn't give Jordan veto power, adding that he
would not hire a coach who couldn't work with the five-time MVP.
	   Jordan said he didn't want to tell Bulls management who their
new coach should be. But he made it clear again the only coach he
would play for _ other than former North Carolina coach Dean Smith
_ is Jackson.
	   ``Jerry Reinsdorf has always made his own choices. Whatever
choices he makes, it doesn't force me to play for his choices,''
Jordan said. ``I'm not going to be unhappy not playing the game of
basketball.''
	   After the Bulls won their sixth title in June, Jackson declined
an offer to return for another year.

Morgan seeks to keep the momentum going
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONG GROVE, Illinois (AP) _ Gil Morgan doesn't want to mess with
his groove.
	   Coming off last week's victory in the Ford Senior Players
Championship, Morgan defends his title beginning Friday in the
Ameritech Senior Open at the Kemper Lakes Golf Club. The tournament
features the top three money leaders on the senior circuit, with a
first-place prize of dlrs 195,000.
	   ``This is a placement type of golf course _ trying to keep it
out of the hazards. It's kind of a strategic kind of golf course,''
Morgan said. ``You play out to the fairways, then to the greens and
then try to get near the hole for a chance to get a birdie.''
	   Morgan enters the tournament with four victories in 14 events
this year and in second place on the PGA Senior Tour money-winning
list with dlrs 1,300,118. He said he has more confidence on the
senior circuit defending a title than he had on the regular tour.
	   ``Here there is less competition from a numbers standpoint, and
there is more disparity in the age groups,'' he said. ``So you're
more confident that you got a significant chance of repeating than
you did on the regular tour.''
	   Hale Irwin, this year's senior money leader at dlrs 1,540,250,
has three three wins in 12 events.
	   Larry Nelson, a first year senior circuit player, is third on
the money list with dlrs 973,353 with two wins in 15 events.

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Police said they were no closer to
discovering the fate of missing American divers Thomas and Eileen
Lonergan despite scientific tests which confirmed that a diver's
board found last month probably belonged to them.
	   The board was found three weeks ago in mangroves at Archers
Point, 12 miles (20 km) south of Cooktown, in north Queensland
state.
	   Faded lettering on the board is believed to include the words:
``Please help us. Find us soon before we die.''
	   Police spokesman Brian Swift said Thursday that tests on the
board had revealed that notes about dives written on one side of
the board had probably been written by Mr. Lonergan.
	   ``Writing on the other side, which included the call for help,
is still undetermined, but it is likely to be that of one of the
Lonergans,'' Swift said.
	   ``We have ruled out that the board was a contrived hoax, but it
brings us no closer to solving the mystery of the Lonergans,'' he
said.
	   Thomas Joseph Lonergan, 33, and his wife Eileen Cassidy
Lonergan, 28, of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, were last seen on Jan. 25
when they went scuba diving from the dive boat Outer Edge at Saint
Crispin Reef, 38 nautical miles northeast of Port Douglas.
	   Swift said tests on the board had revealed it had been in the
water for several months.
	   Although extensive searches failed to find the Lonergans,
several items believed to have belonged to them have since been
recovered, including a swim fin, buoyancy vest, wetsuit hood and an
air tank.
	   A coroner's inquest will open in Cairns on July 22.

Taking advantage of good conditions, Byrum shoots 65 for lead

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Mississippi (AP) _ With conditions prime for scoring,
Curt Byrum birdied his first two holes Thursday on the way to a
7-under-par 65 and the first-round lead in the Deposit Guaranty
Golf Classic.
	   Byrum, playing only his second PGA Tour event of the year, had a
one-stroke lead over five players, including Brian Henninger, the
1994 Deposit Guaranty champion.
	   After six days of rain at Annandale Golf Club, the lift, clean
and place rule was in effect for shots in the fairway and the
greens were soft.
	   ``With the greens slow, you can be really aggressive and go
right at the pins, even from the rough,'' said Byrum, who had six
birdie putts of 12 feet (3 1/2 meters) or less in his morning
round.
	   The soft greens allowed pros to play target golf with approach
shots. But the softness also made the greens prone to spike and
heel marks, which made putting more difficult as the round
progressed.
	   ``I was lucky to play in the morning. We'll see how it is in the
afternoon,'' said Paul Goydos, who had one of the 66s.
	   In addition to the rough greens, a 15-20 mph (24-32 kmph) wind
in the afternoon made the Jack Nicklaus-designed, 7,157-yard
(6,512-meter) course play tougher.
	   Mike Brisky, the first-round leader a year ago, had the low
afternoon round, a 66 to join Henninger, Goydos, Doug Tewell and
Chris Smith a stroke back of the lead.
	   Jay Delsing and Allen Doyle had 67s in the afternoon, Doyle
blowing a chance to tie for the lead with a three-putt on the par-5
18th. Franklin Langham had a 67 earlier in the day.
	   Defending champion Billy Ray Brown shot a 70, and was among 55
players who broke par Thursday.
	   Byrum shot 10-under to tie for 17th in the Quad City Classic
last week in his first PGA event after 14 Nike tournaments this
year. He opened Thursday's round on the back nine, getting a birdie
at No. 10 after hitting a pitching wedge to 12 feet (3.5 meters)
and another at 11 with a sand wedge to 2 feet (0.6 meters).
	   ``Playing well last week gave me some confidence coming here,
then starting with two birdies jump-started me,'' said Byrum, a
17-year pro playing this week as a past tournament champion (1989
Hardee's Classic). ``It was a solid day. I drove well and made some
good putts.''
	   Henninger, whose only PGA Tour victory was the rain-shortened
Deposit Guaranty in 1994, had to get up and down to save par on his
first two holes. He found the rough on his opening tee shot, and
then hit into the bunker fronting No. 2, a 213-yard (194-meter)
par-3.
	   ``I got my act together after that,'' said Henninger, who had
three birdies in the next four holes. ``You have to take advantage
of playing early.''
	   Henninger sank a 50-foot (15-meter) putt on the ninth hole.
After his only bogey, on the 473-yard (430-meter) 14th, his next
shot was a 5-iron to within a foot on the 176-yard (160-meter)
15th.
	   Goydos saved his round with a chip-in birdie after missing the
green to the left on the 171-yard (155-meter) 12th hole.
	   ``No. 12 was the key hole. It kept the momentum going where the
round could have gone either way,'' said Goydos, who was 13th in
the Quad City, his best finish in 22 tournaments this year.

LONG GROVE, Illinois: another year.

	   Jordan said he hasn't talked to Jackson, who is vacationing in
Turkey and has already said he planned to take the rest of the year
off and spend it away from basketball.
	   ``Phil is not holding me hostage and I'm not holding him
hostage. I'm not trying to hold Scottie Pippen hostage or Jerry
Reinsdorf,'' Jordan said.
	   ``Whatever decisions they make, they are going to do that
anyway. I'll make my own decisions. If it doesn't coincide, so be
it.''
	   Jordan said he felt his input wasn't highly valued in the
selection of a new coach who could be named within a week or so.
	   ``It's very obvious my feelings weren't considered when they
made their coaching decision,'' Jordan said.
	   Floyd, whom Jordan derisively referred to as ``Pink'' during the
season, has no NBA coaching experience.
	   ``I don't know Tim Floyd. I don't have anything against Tim
Floyd,'' Jordan said. ``Having a new coach is like starting out all
over again. He may want to do that. But I don't.''
	   NBA assistants Ron Rothstein, Scott Skiles, Paul Silas and Rick
Carlisle have also interviewed for the job.
	   As a free agent, Jordan said he was not interested in playing
for another NBA team.
	   ``I've always wanted to retire as a Bull,'' he said. ``I'm not
even going to consider going to another organization.''
	   He also discounted a career as a pro golfer _ he shot an 84
Thursday _ and had no interest in owning or working for the Bulls.
He said he would remain in Chicago and be one of their biggest
fans, if he does indeed retire.
	   Asked what he would do after walking away a second time, Jordan
said he wasn't sure. He first retired in October 1993 after his
father was murdered, experimented with baseball and returned 17
months later.
	   Jordan said this time he would be satisfied to leave after
leading the Bulls to a sixth title in eight years, winning a 10th
scoring title, a fifth MVP and a sixth NBA Finals MVP title.
	   ``I'm happy that I have a choice,'' he said. ``I have a choice
to either play or not play. Very few athletes get in this position
where they have a choice to either play or not play.
	   ``That's the happy part about Michael Jordan. It might be
confusing ... but some day you will sit back and sort it out.
	   ``None of you guys can say he stayed longer than he should have
stayed. That's how I've always (felt). I never wanted someone to
put a foot in my butt and kick me out. When I walk away, I want you
all to realize I can still lead the league in scoring, I can still
lead the Chicago Bulls to a championship.''

Thai state telephone firm may scrap controversial contracts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's state telephone company may
revoke contracts with six private firms for a high-speed telephone
network after charges that they colluded in the bidding process for
the project, Thai newspapers reported.
	   The Telephone Organization of Thailand _ TOT _ will first try to
renegotiate the contracts with the six suppliers for the
Synchronous Digital Hierarchy project, the agency's chairman,
Mechai Viravaidya, was quoted as saying in reports Thursday.
	   If the companies _ multinationals Tomen, Siemens, Ericsson and
Mitsui, and Jasmine and Loxley from Thailand - don't agree to lower
their prices, new bids could be opened, other suppliers could be
contacted directly, or the project even scrapped, he said.
	   A member of Parliament from Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's
Democrat Party charged last week that collusion among the bidders
had driven the price of the project up from 10.6 billion baht (dlrs
265 million) to more than 12 billion baht (dlrs 300 million).
	   The lawmaker, Thawee Kraikupt, accused Communications Minister
Suthep Thaugsuban, a fellow Democrat, of involvement with the
scandal.
	   ``The TOT needs transparency in the project,'' Mechai was quoted
as saying in The Nation daily, in explanation of Wednesday's
decision..
	   The contentious contracts involve supplying 9,000 kilometers
(5,580 miles) of fiber-optic cable and supporting equipment.
	   The reports said the six firms would still undertake the
installation of the high-speed Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
project, which accounts for about 15 percent of the entire project
cost.

	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Warsaw authorities are offering four new
locations to Michael Jackson for consideration as sites for his
planned amusement park, a Jackson lawyer said Thursday.
	   '' We believe that all the options are very interesting and we
are going to look into them in a very, very serious fashion,'' said
Amnon Shiboleth, who discussed the project with city authorities
during a visit this week.
	   Last year, the King of Pop signed a letter of intent with Warsaw
Mayor Marcin Swiecicki to develop a dlrs 500 million theme park in
Warsaw. However, the Interior Ministry refused to let go of his
favored site, a military airport where Jackson performed two years
ago.
	   The mayor refused to identify the sites, saying city authorities
had to check their ownership first.
	   Swiecicki said he hoped all problems could be solved before May
1999, when the current letter of intent expires.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SCITUATE, Massachusetts (AP) _ Aerosmith drummer Joey Kramer
suffered minor burns when his Ferrari caught fire as he filled up
at a gas station.
	   The fire Wednesday was apparently due to a leak in the hose,
fire spokesman Richard Handrahan said. Heat from the car ignited
fuel as it leaked, he said.
	   Kramer's arms and a hand were burned. Flames scorched the car.
	   ``He was very lucky that he wasn't seriously injured,''
Handrahan said.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Antonio Banderas has pulled out of a film about
Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey, amid protests
by Greek-Americans.
	   Robin Baum, publicist for the star of ``The Mask of Zorro,''
didn't mention the movie's critics in explaining his departure,
saying Banderas wants to devote his time to the movie adaptation of
``The Phantom of the Opera.''
	   The project's producer, Laurence Olivier's son Tarquin Olivier,
said he hadn't been told Banderas was leaving and planned to meet
with him Friday.
	   The protesters fear a favorable portrayal of Ataturk might lead
to a warming of popular feeling toward Turkey, a historical rival
of Greece.
	   ``It isn't honorable for a minority to block artistic
expression,'' Olivier said, attributing the protests to ``a few
disenchanted Greeks, a few disenchanted Armenians.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Richard Rodriguez has been riding a roller coaster
in Blackpool, England for four weeks, breaking his own world
record, and he's still going.
	   New York-born Rodriguez had endured the ups and downs of
Blackpool's Big Dipper for 600 hours when he achieved his new
record Wednesday. He spends 22 hours daily on the roller coaster.
	   Normand St. Pierre at La Ronde Park in Montreal, Quebec is
challenging Rodriguez for his title. St. Pierre is only two days
behind the champion, but Rodriguez has pledged to outlast his
competitor.
	   ``He wants to break my record,'' Rodriguez said Wednesday.
``We've been rivals for years, so I welcome the challenge. I'm
going to stay on for as long as it takes.''
	   Rodriguez follows the strict guidelines imposed by the
``Guinness Book of Records'' before it stopped tracking the roller
coaster competition several years ago. He eats, sleeps and drinks
in his favorite carriage in the middle of the wooden roller coaster
and takes off two hours each day to shower and eat a hot meal.
	   Rodriguez, a diabetic, is donating sponsorship funds to diabetes
research.
	   The Big Dipper, which is 75 years old this year, features five
drops and reaches up to 35 miles (56 km) per hour.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Leonardo DiCaprio was quoted in Britain's Eva
magazine as saying he finds kissing ``disgusting,'' but one of his
publicists said the interview was based on a fabrication and
demanded a retraction.
	   ``When you think about it, kissing is pretty disgusting,'' the
23-year-old ``Titanic'' star was quoted as saying. ``The human
mouth is one of the dirtiest things on this planet. There's so much
bacteria, slime and trapped food _ a dog's mouth is much cleaner.''
	   But publicist Deborah Grimes in Los Angeles said DiCaprio never
gave an interview to the magazine.
	   No one was available to respond to Grimes' comments at the
magazine Thursday. Eva's editor, Terry Tavner, did not immediately
return a call left on a home answering machine.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Roy Orbison's estate is suing Sony
for more than dlrs 12 million in a dispute over foreign royalties.
	   The estate sued Sony last August. An amended complaint filed
last week specifies a dollar amount, claiming Sony misrepresented
record contracts and royalty rates used to calculate payment to the
estate.
	   ``Americans don't realize sometimes that he has always been huge
in Europe, and he still is,'' estate lawyer Sam Lipshie said.
``Foreign (royalties) are much bigger for Roy Orbison than they are
for a lot of American artists because he's always been a superstar
there.''
	   Sony attorney Jay Bowen said: ``Sony feels that it has
calculated and paid all the royalties due the estate in a worldwide
market in which calculating royalties and accounting of units sold
is a difficult process at best.''
	   Orbison, whose hits included ``Pretty Woman,'' died in 1988.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ Exactly 80 years after Bolshevik
revolutionaries murdered the last Russian emperor and his family,
they were being buried Friday in a ceremony with many of the
trappings of a state funeral. The remains of Czar Nicholas II were
borne home to the imperial capital Thursday and driven solemnly
through the streets to the cathedral where he, his family and
servants, will take their places alongside three centuries of
Russian rulers. President Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly changed his
mind Thursday and announced that he would attend the burial,
suddenly elevating its status to something closer to the grand
state ceremony that had once been foreseen. Nicholas was murdered
on July 17, 1918, along with his wife, their five children and four
servants. Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried
to erase all traces of the corpses. After the collapse of the
Soviet Union, nine of the bodies were recovered and subjected to
years of tests to confirm their identification. (RUSSIA-CZAR'S
BURIAL)
	   PARIS (AP) _ Syrian President Hafez Assad began a rare trip to
the West on Thursday, arriving for two days of talks that France
hopes will bring a new dimension to the Mideast peace process. The
trip, the Syrian leader's first here in 22 years, was also cause
for controversy. Families of Holocaust victims protested Assad's
silence on the whereabouts of an accused Nazi war criminal said to
be hiding in Syria; the Committee for a Free Lebanon was
demonstrating against Syrian occupation of Lebanon; and a human
rights group demanded Syria free political prisoners. President
Jacques Chirac met for nearly three hours with Assad on Thursday
and was holding a state dinner for him later at the Elysee Palace.
The two leaders were to meet again Friday. (FRANCE-SYRIA)
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ The justice ministry announced Thursday
that it will look into allegations of misconduct in a high profile
treason trial rife with scandal. The proceedings were tainted by
defense charges that the judge had secretly maintained an improper
relationship with a female member of the defense team and discussed
the case with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Netanyahu has
vehemently denied the charges. The judge has also denied any
wrongoing. The preliminary investigation was announced hours after
Nahum Manbar, convicted of treason, was sentenced to 16 years in
jail for selling chemical weapons materials to Iran.
(ISRAEL-SCANDAL)
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In his first comments on recent military
raids in the southern state of Chiapas, leftist rebel leader
Subcomandante Marcos accused the government of waging a war against
guerrillas and Indians. In a statement released Thursday, dated
``July, 1998, from the mountains of Southeastern Mexico,'' Marcos
said President Ernesto Zedillo's policies have convinced the rebels
that dialogue with the government is useless. ``Zedillo destroyed
any confidence in his government. Without confidence, it is
impossible to reach agreements. If there are no agreements, why
hold a dialogue?'' Marcos wrote. Ten people have died in recent
crackdowns on pro-rebel villages. (MEXICO-CHIAPAS)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a warning to separatists, Serb
police raided the headquarters of Kosovo's largest ethnic Albanian
party Thursday, moments after their self-styled parliament swore in
a president. Fighting was reported for the first time, meanwhile,
in a strategic area south of Kosovo's capital, Pristina, where a
two-hour gunbattle raged between Serb security forces and Albanian
militants, Serb sources said. Police seized documents at the office
of the Democratic League of Kosovo, moments after the province's
self-proclaimed parliament _ meeting for the first time _ swore in
party leader Ibrahim Rugova as president. There were no arrests
during the half-hour operation. In Washington, State Department
spokesman James Rubin called the raid ``emblematic of the
repressive nature'' of Yugoslav rule in Kosovo. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)

	   A summary of late financial and business news from The
Associated Press. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks rallied to record levels Thursday, with a
fresh batch of stronger-than-expected corporate profits and a surge
in technology shares pulling Wall Street from its early morning
lows. Preliminary calculations showed the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 94.74 points at 9,329.22, closing above 9,300 for
the first time and topping the previous record set on Tuesday.
Broader indicators also were higher, including the technology-heavy
Nasdaq composite index which rallied to its seventh straight record
and flirted with a close above 2,000. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian parliament agreed Thursday to a
national sales tax, giving the government a surprise victory in its
effort to pass an economic austerity plan demanded by international
lending agencies. Parliament's lower house, the State Duma, adopted
the tax law on a third reading late in the evening after Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov chastised the legislators for risking the
loss of international loans. Hours earlier, the Duma had rejected
the sales tax and a land tax measure, casting doubt on whether the
government could win passage of its economic program. Legislators
will meet again Friday to consider the rest of the 20-point
economic plan. On Monday, the International Monetary Fund's board
of directors will consider its dlrs 17 billion financial bailout
for Russia. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Royal Dutch-Shell has pulled out of the
massive Camisea gas fields project in the Amazon rain forest,
rocking one of the pillars of Peru's planned economic development.
Shell said Wednesday night it would not continue with the dlrs 3
billion project, the largest natural resource investment in Peru's
history, because it wanted greater control over the sale and
marketing of the natural gas. The Anglo-Dutch oil giant was the
operator in a partnership with Mobil Oil, based in Fairfax,
Virginia. Mobil, which made no separate announcement, is also
pulling out of the deal. The three Camisea gas fields, located 350
miles (550 kms) southeast of Lima amid some of the world's most
biodiverse jungle, are the largest gas reserves in the Americas,
estimated to contain more than 11 trillion (310 billion cubic
meters) cubic feet of natural gas and 600 million barrels of
condensates. President Alberto Fujimori on Thursday called Shell's
decision unfortunate, but said Peru would seek new companies to
develop the fields. (PERU-SHELL PULLOUT)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Production slumped last month at U.S.
factories, chilled by the General Motors strike and continuing
shock waves from Asia. Manufacturers already have trimmed payrolls,
and those employees have cut back on spending _ a trend that
economists warn could spread to more Americans in just a few
months. The magnitude of the slump _ 0.6 percent in June _
reflected an 11 percent plunge in the production of autos, light
trucks and automotive products because of the GM strike. With only
a few exceptions, the performance of the rest of industrial America
also was lackluster at best. Asian turmoil is hurting U.S.
manufacturers in two ways. They're selling fewer exports to the
region, and because of the devaluation of Asian currencies, they
face increased competition at home from cheap imports. (US-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The U.S. government urged a quick and thorough
investigation at the World Bank into allegations about possible
kickbacks and other wrongdoing uncovered after an internal probe at
the bank. ``We would encourage them to get to the bottom of this,''
said White House spokesman Mike McCurry. The U.S. Congress is
considering whether to provide the bank's sister institution, the
International Monetary Fund with dlrs 18 billion in new funding as
well as replenishing a bank fund used to make loans to the world's
poorest nations. World Bank Director James Wolfensohn said that he
has set up a special fraud team and hired two global accounting
firms, PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Deloitte Touche, to look into the
allegations. (US-WORLD BANK-AUDIT)

<TEXT>
	   CHATEAUROUX, France (AP) _ Soon, the Tour de France may be able
to concentrate of the race.
	   But not yet.
	   Nearly every day since the Tour started last Saturday in
Ireland, there has been an event essentially not linked to the
Tour.
	   Starting in Ireland was an historic event in itself, the first
time the world's most prestigious cycling race started there. No
sooner than Chris Boardman get the lead after winning the prologue,
he crashed out of the race on Monday, the yellow jersey stained
with his blood from severe cuts and bruises.
	   However even before the Tour started, the Festina drug story
stained cycling. It began in Belgium following the arrest of one of
it staff with a load of drugs in a team car. The early denials,
then accusations by the arrested man saying he was just following
team orders.
	   Then came a mass transfer back to France and the suspension from
the sport of the Festina team director, Bruno Roussel, who is also
being held by police.
	   Meanwhile, there is still racing happening.
	   The overall lead has changed three times in four days. Sprinters
battle for bonus seconds during and at the end of the race and
defending champion Jan Ullrich is in a position to strike quickly.
	   ``The Tour direction hopes that sport and the race take priority
again,'' said Jean-Marie LeBlanc, the Tour's top executive.
	   It won't be easy.
	   The cloud over the Tour de France was growing quickly Thursday
with the suspension of Roussel.
	   The International Cycling Union announced Thursday morning, just
before the start of the Tour's fifth stage, that Roussel had failed
to respond adequately to an investigation from the French Cycling
Federation.
	   LeBlanc said that the riders of the Festina team would not
affected by this suspension.``They have clearly expressed they want
to continue in competition,'' he said.
	   Also, Miquel Rodriguez, the chief executive officer of the
Festina watch company based in Spain, said that he will not pull
the team from the race and threatened legal action to any false
accusations against his riders.
	   Roussel and Festina team doctor Erik Ryckaert were still being
questioned by police after their detention was extended Thursday.
	   They were taken in by police following Wednesday's stage.
	   Police from the northern city of Lille came down to conduct the
investigation. That's where a Belgian member of the Festina team
has been under arrest since last week.
	   Meanwhile the riders tried to concentrate on racing.
	   Mario Cipollini of Italy won the fifth stage of the Tour de
France Thursday, while American champion George Hincapie moved into
second place overall.
	   Australian Stuart O'Grady held the lead for the second day in a
row after he became the fourth rider to have the overall lead since
the start.
	   Hincapie moved within seven seconds, getting four bonus seconds
at an individual sprint.
	   ``There is definitely some pressure to get the yellow,''
Hincapie said. ``My team wants it as much as I do.''
	   Hincapie is a member of the U.S. Postal team, in only its second
year on the Tour. A rider in yellow would be a prestigious
accomplishment for the team directed by 1984 Olympic cycling
champion Mark Gorski.
	   But Hincapie still is tired of getting in position to go for
sprints.
	   ``It's starting to wear on me,'' he said. ``It's been a long two
days. I might not go for the sprints and go for points at the stage
finish.''
	   Friday's stage is another flat stage but Saturday is a time
trial where Ullrich may make a move to get to the top of the
standings.
	   Ullrich, who was overweight and out of shape prior to the Tour,
came into the race fit and could gain enough time to get into first
overall.
	   Cipollini beat another top sprinter, Erik Zabel of Germany.
	   It was the seventh career stage victory for Cipollini. Zabel
also has seven Tour stage wins.
	   Most of the pack finished in the same time, enabling Stuart
O'Grady of Australia to retain the yellow jersey after the 142-mile
(227-kilometer) leg from Cholet to Chateauroux in central France.

John Huston sticks to Tiger Woods _ using magnets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ American John Huston has his magnets
working on this side of the Atlantic, too.
	   Huston started sleeping on a magnet-laced mattress cover six
months ago to relieve aching bursitis and tendinitis. He's played
some of his best golf since then, including a 5-under-65 Thursday
to share the first-round lead of the British Open with Tiger Woods.
	   ``Last year, pretty much every day, I would get up and wouldn't
feel very strong, kind of achey,'' said the 37-year-old American.
``I didn't look forward to going to the golf course, and it
showed.''
	   This season, Huston won his first tour event in four years _ the
Hawaiian Open _ and has five top-10 finishes to go with it. Now
he's also contending in the Open, where he's missed the cut twice
and never finished better than 31st.
	   Despite a lack of scientific studies to show magnets work,
dozens of well-known athletes wear them to ease pain and boost
blood flow.
	   Golfer Jim Colbert used them to cure a problem similar to
Huston's and New York Yankees pitcher Hideki Irabu wears a
long-sleeve shirt that conceals a series of tiny magnets.
	   Huston began sleeping on a magnetic mattress cover in January to
relieve the tendinitis in his right wrist and the bursitis in his
left shoulder. He also has begun wearing magnets in his insoles.
	   ``It seems to really help. It has little magnets all
throughout,'' Huston said of the cover. ``It kind of feels like a
lumpy mattress.''
	   He has one cover at home and takes another on the road. His
wife, Suzanne, also likes it, he said.
	   ``They say some people feel a tingling, but I don't,'' Huston
said. ``I don't think there's any proof that it actually does work
other than people that use them think that they feel better.''
	   ``I figured I could work it out somehow, but nothing I tried
last year seemed to help,'' he added. ``I took a couple of months
off last year, tried working out. I can't say which helped the
most, but finally I've started to feel better.''
	   Huston saved par on the first hole with a 25-foot (7.5-meter)
putt, which steadied him for an even-par 34 on the front nine.
	   ``I made a really good save,'' he said. ``That kind of
jump-started my round.''
	   With help from those magnets.

International team heading for Kosovo; US denounces police raid

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A day after a Serb police raid on
Kosovo's largest ethnic Albanian party, an international team is
headed for the embattled Yugoslav province in the latest diplomatic
bid to end the fighting and pave the way for peace talks.
	   The fact-finding team from the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe planned to meet ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova on Friday.
	   Rugova, the newly elected president of the unauthorized Kosovo
parliament, is the ethnic Albanian politician whom the Americans
and Europeans want to lead a delegation in talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   But Serb-led Yugoslavia's bloody, five-month crackdown on the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army has triggered a backlash not
only against the government but also against Rugova, whose
commitment to non-violence has failed to end the bloodshed or win
self-rule.
	   That has won converts to the extremist Kosovo Liberation Army,
which is fighting for independence from Serbia, which is part of
Yugoslavia. Albanians outnumber Serbs in Kosovo 9-to-1.
	   Serb and Albanian sources reported scattered clashes late
Wednesday and Thursday, including a strategic area that controls
the main highway from Pristina to the Macedonian capital Skopje.
	   In a bid to shore up his political position, Rugova on Thursday
convened the 120-member Kosovo parliament, elected last March but
never authorized by the government in Belgrade.
	   Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo party, or LDK, controls 90
percent of the seats, in part because hard-line groups boycotted
the election. No sooner had Rugova taken his oath as president than
Serb police raided the LDK headquarters, where the session had
taken place.
	   There were no arrests, but police said the prosecutor could file
charges because of the ``attempt to constitute'' the illegal
parliament.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
raid was part of a ``repressive'' strategy that is driving ethnic
Albanians into the extremists' camp.
	   Nevertheless, police waited until the end of the 20-minute
session to enter the building, suggesting Serb authorities were not
seriously attempting to muzzle Rugova but rather send a warning.
	   Rugova also supports independence but his opposition to violence
has won him international _ if not local _ support.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, a senior aide to Milosevic was
willing to negotiate autonomy, which the government withdrew in
1989. But the aide, Gorica Gajevic, said the government would never
agree to an independent Kosovo established ``through terrorism and
banditry.''
	   On Thursday, the government-allied Serb Media Center said a
``large group'' of Albanians attacked a police patrol near Prizren,
about 60 kilometers (40 miles) southwest of Pristina and withdrew
after a two-hour gunbattle. There was no report of casualties in
the fighting, the first reported in the Prizren area.
	   Earlier, Serb sources reported KLA rebels attacked a patrol late
Wednesday near Urosevac and one Albanian was killed. Urosevac
controls the main highway between Pristina and Skopje, and the
fighting could signal a KLA attempt to block a major transport
artery.
	   In reporting on the Prizren clashes, the Kosovo Information
Center, close to Rugova's party, said Serbian police set fire to
three Albanian homes near the town and heavy gunfire could be heard
in the area.
	   Elsewhere, Serb sources said Albanian fighters attacked a lead
and zinc mine 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of Pristina but
were driven off. Rebels control most of that area except for the
mine itself.
	   In their account of the mine clash, Albanian sources said police
shelled seven KLA-controlled villages in the area late Wednesday
but there were no casualties.
	   The Albanian center also reported that fighting in the Decane
region of western Kosovo had claimed the lives of two ethnic
Albanians in the past two days.

John Daly: Fat and out of shape but sober
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOUTHPORT, England (AP) _ John Daly admits he's fat and out of
shape, but at least he's not drinking.
	   ``You go from one addiction to another,'' said Daly, a
recovering alcoholic who opened with a 3-over 73 in Thursday's
first round of the British Open.
	   ``Mine seems to be food right now. Hopefully, that will change.
The people who are helping me on my program say it will, and I
would like that.''
	   Daly, the 1995 British Open winner, speaks openly about his
alcoholism and his golf bag carries the words ``God, serenity,
courage, wisdom'' in large letters.
	   ``I'm winning a major every day I wake up,'' he said.
	   ``If I really did win here, it would not compare to what I do on
a daily basis in my life,'' he added. ``It's been a real
struggle.''
	   An unflattering photo ran Thursday in many of Britain's
newspapers showing him with a cigarette dangling from his mouth, a
putter in one hand and a soft drink in the other. And his puffed up
rain suit made him look even bigger than he is.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SHAZAM: &LR;  Tom Lehman may be a great golfer, but he's apparently a
lousy gymnast.
	   The '96 British Open champion came within 45 minutes of
withdrawing from Thursday's first round after he sprained his right
shoulder in a fall Tuesday ``roughhousing'' with his three
children.
	   ``We went over to the amusement park into the little discovery
zone place with the kids,'' said Lehman, who still nursed himself
to a 1-over 71.
	   ``I was just goofing off with my wife and the kids and _ shazam.
Basically, I was doing a handstand and kind of fell over on my
shoulder,'' he added, pausing for an embarrassed laugh.
	   ``Oooh it hurt, I couldn't even lift my arm. I couldn't even
lift my shirt without it hurting.''
	   ``I guess the funhouse wasn't that much fun,'' said his caddie
Andy Martinez.
	   Lehman, 39, notified the Royal and Ancient Golf Club late
Wednesday that alternate Malcolm McKenzie ``should get ready like
he's going to play,'' Lehman said.
	   ``I wasn't expecting to play and when I started warming up I
thought there was no way,'' he said. ``After an hour an a half of
practice it finally felt like I could get some club head speed
going.''
	   ``My swing still wasn't quite right, I kind of had to
manufacture a swing out there. But it was close enough so I could
at least find it.''
	   Lehman, who was initially reported to have been hurt on a
carousel, also sprained his left ankle a few weeks ago walking
around a course he's designing.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   YOU'RE THE MAN: &LR;  Lee Westwood and Tiger Woods both bragged about
the warm-hearted crowds Thursday. But Westwood, with a 1-over 71,
suggested he'd like to quiet a few Woods' fans.
	   ``The crowds were very good all the way around,'' the Englishman
said. ``A couple of `you're the man' have appeared, but hopefully
we can stamp them out early.''
	   He'd also like to ban mobile phones.
	   ``I don't know why people bring phones on to the golf course. If
you need to bring one you're too busy and shouldn't be here, you
should be at work.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHIP SHOTS: &LR;  Barclay Howard was the low amateur last year but
discovered a month later he had leukemia. He's undergoing
chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant from his sister and hopes
to resume playing by the end of the year.
	   This is the eighth British Open at Royal Birkdale and a Briton
has yet to win here. Peter Thomson of Australia won in 1954,
followed by Arnold Palmer (61), Thomson (65), Lee Trevino (71),
Johnny Miller (76), Tom Watson (83) and Ian Baker-Finch (91).
	   Look for the dogleg 6th hole to present major problems. It's a
par-4, 480 yards and in 1991 it had a higher stroke average than
the par-5 17th, which is rated one of the most difficult driving
holes at Royal Birkdale.

<TEXT>
	   MADISON, Mississippi (AP) _ Doug Tewell wrapped up a 6-under par
66 in the first round of the Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic, then
went to his real job Thursday afternoon.
	   In addition to playing part-time on the PGA Tour, Tewell is an
on-course commentator for The Golf Channel, a cable network that is
televising the entire Deposit Guaranty Classic.
	   ``My No. 1 job is with The Golf Channel,'' said Tewell, who
after playing a morning round was back on the Annandale course for
a three-hour broadcast in the afternoon. ``I started broadcasting
three years ago, and thought it would be a good bridge to the
Senior Tour.''
	   With the blessing of his broadcast bosses, Tewell is also
playing PGA Tour events. This is the second year in a row that he
has played in and broadcast the DGGC.
	   The 48-year-old Tewell, a four-time PGA Tour winner, is trying
to stay in playing shape for when he becomes eligible for the
Senior Tour in August 1999.
	   ``I've thrown a wrench into those plans this year,'' Tewell
said. ``I've had a couple of top 10s lately and all of a sudden won
dlrs 170,000.''
	   His goals have now changed. He wants to earn an unrestricted
Tour exemption and be able to play selected PGA tournaments next
year.
	   Going into the second round of the DGGC, Tewell is just one shot
off the lead. Tewell will play Friday afternoon, which means he
will be playing and not broadcasting on The Golf Channel.
	   He has made six of his seven cuts this season, including top 10
finishes at the MCI Classic and two weeks ago at Hartford. At last
week's Quad City Classic, he was also a player and Golf Channel
broadcaster.
	   The fatigue of doing both showed up in the final round of the
Quad City, when Tewell had six bogeys and seven birdies in a
1-under 69. He finished tied for 35th at 8-under for the
tournament.
	   ``Fatigue will become a major factor come the weekend,'' said
Tewell, who took a break after the Quad City to fly to Florida and
spend time with his 8-month-old grandson.
	   Tewell didn't even play in practice rounds this week at
Annandale, where he shot 6-under 288 last year and won dlrs 2,230
after finishing in a tie for 57th place. He was able to do his
broadcast duties on the weekend after playing early rounds Saturday
and Sunday.
	   ``The plan was to play a couple of days, make the cut, make a
check and then finish out on The Golf Channel,'' Tewell said of his
plans when he began broadcasting. ``I've turned that around, and
Golf Channel has been good to me.
	   ``If I win this tournament (and dlrs 216,000), I may give Golf
Channel a little break on my fee,'' he said.

Assad, Chirac have much to talk about in Paris
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previus. Will be led after morning talks with Chirac,
beginning at 1130 GMT. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ It's been 22 years since Syrian President Hafez
Assad visited France, and it's exceedingly rare that he comes to
the West at all. So it must have felt good to get the red-carpet
treatment at President Jacques Chirac's elegant Elysee Palace.
	   Leaving the palace for a quick rest after presidential talks,
Assad was feted by a band of the Republican Guard, in their golden
helmets with long red plumes. The minute he left, women in flowing
gowns began arriving for a state dinner in his honor.
	   Even if the talks hadn't gone on much longer than expected, it
was clear Chirac and Assad had much to discuss.
	   For France, working with Assad could be a way to a more
influential role in the stagnant Mideast peace process _ a way of
counter-balancing the heavy weight of the United States.
	   Chirac said himself during a toast at the dinner that he was
determined ``not to let the peace process collapse.''
	   And in their private talks, he was blunter, according to his
spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
	   While reiterating his support for American mediation, Chirac
said it is necessary to consider what to do ``in case the current
efforts halt.''
	   An international conference could end the impasse, Chirac said,
again raising a French-Egyptian proposal made in May.
	   Assad apparently gave a lukewarm response to the proposal.
Colonna said only that the Syrian ``did not refuse the idea.''
	   In his own toast, Assad blamed Israel for ``reducing to zero''
the peace process.
	   For Assad, the trip could be a chance to become more of a global
player. He, too, seeks an alternative to U.S. mediation in the
Mideast _ though in his toast, he said he saw no ``opposition''
between the European and U.S. efforts.
	   The United States has accused Syria of sponsoring international
terrorism, a charge that Damascus denies.
	   But France has a different relationship with Syria, partly
because it was once a French-mandated territory, from 1920-1946.
	   Among Arab nations, there is a growing interest in greater
European diplomacy to break the impasse. And French intervention in
the region has occasionally advanced the process where American
policy failed.
	   During Israel's offensive against Hezbollah guerrillas in
southern Lebanon in 1996, France engineered a truce that still
stands. And last month, France guaranteed an exchange of prisoners
and soldiers' remains between Lebanon and Israel.
	   But there was one problematic issue that Chirac had to bring up
with Assad _ the case of accused Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner,
long said to be hiding in Syria.
	   Colonna said Chirac raised the issue during two hours and 40
minutes of talks, but failed to get a ``precise response.'' Chirac
planned to bring up the case again at dinner, she said. The two
were to meet again Friday morning.
	   Brunner, blamed for the deaths of 130,000 Jews from Germany,
Austria, France and Greece, has been the object of a French
judicial investigation since 1988, and families of Holocaust
victims protested Assad's silence at a demonstration in front of
the Syrian Embassy.
	   ``Shame to Assad Who Protects the Nazi Criminal Brunner'' read
one banner at the peaceful protest Thursday.
	   Paris has requested permission for a French magistrate to go to
Syria to investigate the matter.
	   In a French television interview broadcast Wednesday, the Syrian
leader denied any knowledge of Brunner's whereabouts.
	   ``If you know where he is, go immediately to his address to find
out whether or not he is there,'' Assad said.

Aid groups complaining about edicts, European Union threatening
</HEADLINE>
Taliban &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A group of international aid organizations
is drafting a letter to send to the Taliban listing why they cannot
work under edicts imposed by the Afghan authorities, sources said
Thursday.
	   The letter, still in its initial stages, was to be sent to the
Taliban authorities before a Sunday deadline requiring that aid
workers start preparing to move into abandoned university
dormitories on the outskirts of Kabul, said the sources, who spoke
on condition they not be identified.
	   The letter lists Taliban edicts and rules that have interfered
with the work of the international organizations and explains why
they can't work ``in the sense of good development, good
humanitarian assistance,'' said the sources familiar with the
letter's contents.
	   The non-governmental organizations have protested the relocation
edict and some have threatened to leave the city. The European
Union, which as the largest donor to Afghanistan funnels money
through the NGOs, has warned the Taliban authorities against
enforcing the edict.
	   ``Without these NGOs as implementing agencies, the urgently
needed humanitarian programs will not be possible,'' Austrian
ambassador Ernst Sucharipa told a U.N. humanitarian committee
meeting Wednesday. Austria currently holds the EU presidency.
	   The United Nations has also warned that their patience is
growing thin with the Taliban authorities, who have imposed a
strict version of Islamic rule in the 85 percent of the country it
controls.
	   The Taliban have forced girls out of schools and women out of
jobs. Health care for women is limited. Men are beaten if they
shave or refuse to wear a head covering and are encouraged to go to
the mosque.
	   The Taliban has said it wanted to relocate the aid workers to
the dormitories for their safety, but the aid organizations say
that being housed all together actually presents a security risk
since it makes them easy targets.
	   U.N. agencies have not fallen under the relocation edict, but
the chief U.N. envoy to the country, Lakhdar Brahimi, said Tuesday
that the United Nations was coming under increasing pressure from
the donor community to simply pull its 60 international workers out
of the country.
	   Representatives from several U.N. agencies, including Brahimi,
were to meet Friday at U.N. headquarters to discuss the situation.
On Thursday, representatives from Afghanistan's six neighbors _
Iran, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Pakistan and China _ as
well as the United States and Russia convened.
	   Relations have been deteriorating steadily between the United
Nations and the Taliban, though talks got under way this week on
implementing some humanitarian aspects of a May agreement on
humanitarian aid.
	   ``There has been no major change, but there has been progress in
that the Taliban has learned that they have to come to terms with
the international community,'' Alfredo Witschi-Cestari, the U.N.
coordinator for humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, said in an
interview here.
	   The Taliban's representative in the United States, Noorullah
Zadran, said the criticism against the Afghan authorities was
unfair. At a news conference Thursday, he defended the relocation
edict as a move to protect aid workers and actually give them
better living conditions than what they had.
	   ``We certainly do not see that place as a ghetto. That is really
farfetched,'' he said.
	   The NGOs and the United Nations, however, say that the buildings
are dilapidated and will require serious infrastructure repairs
before they could even become livable. Some suggest that is the
reason for the relocation _ to pour more money into rebuilding that
part of Kabul.

	   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) _ Costa Rica has accused the
Nicaraguan army of preventing Costa Rican police from patrolling
the San Juan River, which marks the border between the two
countries.
	   Foreign Minister Roberto Rojas said Thursday that Nicaraguan
troops blocked Costa Rican police boats trying to patrol the river.
	   In Managua, meanwhile, President Arnoldo Aleman said Costa Rica
was patrolling the border area with armed troops without first
warning Nicaragua, an act he said violates agreements between the
two countries.
	   A few small stretches of the river have been contested by both
sides for more than a century. But the disputed area has frequently
been used by Nicaraguan illegal immigrants entering Costa Rica in
search of temporary work.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Wherever he flies in South
Africa, Andreas van Wyk pesters airline employees.
	   He wants to hear ``fasten your seat belts'' in Afrikaans _ the
indigenous language that was encouraged by the white apartheid
regime.
	   Usually airline personnel meet his demands. But twice recently
South African Airlines filed charges against van Wyk because he
refused to heed instructions in English.
	   ``I'm fighting for my language,'' says van Wyk, a supporter of
the Freedom Front Party, a small, conservative group.
	   When the country's first all-race elections ended white minority
rule in 1994, President Nelson Mandela's governing African National
Congress opened a linguistic Pandora's box.
	   It added nine languages spoken by blacks _ like Zulu, Xhosa and
Sesotho _ to the official Afrikaans and English. The move, critics
said, left one tongue supreme _ English.
	   Faced with making pre-flight safety announcements in 11
languages, South African Airlines pared down to English. Similar
decisions have given English near supremacy at universities,
Parliament, the post office, the telephone company. Afrikaans is
down to 5 percent air time on television.
	   ``The whole country is being overridden with Anglo-American
culture ... at the cost of all other languages,'' complains Marlene
van Niekerk, an Afrikaner writer.
	   But as the majority black country sorts out a new identity after
four decades of white oppression, something unexpected is
happening.
	   Afrikaans, the language whose forced use sparked the 1976
anti-apartheid riots in the black township of Soweto outside
Johannesburg, is discovering a new life.
	   At Nkholi Primary School, for example, the parents of black
children in Soweto _ where 600 people died in the 1976 protests _
have opted to add Afrikaans to the Sesotho and English taught
there.
	   ``There was a clear agreement by parents that we are part of the
new South Africa, and that these children will grow up and have to
work with Afrikaans,'' says the principal, Constance Molefakgotla.
	   Although English seems to have gained an edge, Afrikaans is
spoken by just over half of whites, and since whites dominate the
economy, those black parents feel their children must learn the
language to improve job opportunities.
	   Afrikaans is a patois that developed from the Dutch of early
white settlers, the Malay brought by 17th century slaves and the
indigenous languages of the Khoi and bushmen in the Cape Town
region.
	   The Malay community published the first known Afrikaans
literature in 1845 _ Islamic religious texts written in Arabic
script. This was decades before Afrikaners, the descendants of
Dutch and other white settlers, started printing Afrikaans in Roman
script and eventually made it a language many identified with white
domination.
	   Achmat Davids, a Malay descendant and scholar in Cape Town, says
whites hijacked the language and created a myth of racially purity.
	   ``I have an ax to grind with the Afrikaner, who claimed it to be
his language,'' Davids says.
	   Afrikaans, however, provided a cultural rallying point for
Afrikaners when they began their rise from mine workers and farmers
this century to wrest rule in 1948 from the English.
	   With English still widely spoken and used in schools and the
financial world, the National Party government declared Afrikaans
the major language of school instruction, triggering the Soweto
riots that mobilized the anti-apartheid movement at home and
abroad.
	   Yet Afrikaans hasn't been the exclusive possession of whites.
	   Olga Sema, a black educator and resource expert for Gauteng
Province, has taught Afrikaans for 17 years.
	   ``I love this language _ it's so rich idiomatically,'' Sema
says. ``It just has this baggage'' from the apartheid era.
	   A black provincial governor, Mathews Phosa, writes prize-winning
poetry in Afrikaans.
	   Linguists say South Africa's major language group is Zulu, which
is spoken by an estimated 23 percent of the population. It's
followed by Xhosa at 17 percent and Afrikaans at 16 percent.
English is down the ladder at 8 percent.
	   More than half of Afrikaans speakers now are mixed race or
black, the experts say.
	   After apartheid ended, the Stigting vir Afrikaans (Foundation
for Afrikaans) set up literacy projects for uneducated non-white
speakers in the Cape Town region, where various dialects are
spoken.
	   Financed largely by the Afrikaans press and other cultural
organizations, this type of gentle persuasion is much more the norm
than the confrontational approach of militant Afrikaners who
earlier this year violently objected to black demands for English
instruction in Vryburg.
	   Across the political spectrum, many South Africans agree that
the only way to help Afrikaans fend off English is to develop black
languages with the same rigor applied to Afrikaans earlier this
century.
	   Starting in the 1920s, Afrikaner cultural and mining societies
developed Afrikaans words for a variety of business fields and
sciences. After gaining power, the National Party government poured
money into the University of Stellenbosch's project to document the
Afrikaans lexicon.
	   If the nine official black languages received similar support,
they would have a better survival chance, and linguistic diversity
would strengthen.
	   There's not a lot of money for language projects now, even
though the ANC government continues support for the Afrikaans
project at Stellenbosch. Still, the university has started lexicon
projects with writers of the nine black languages.
	   In a new democracy struggling to overcome widespread poverty and
unemployment, finances present a large barrier.
	   But cultural hurdles are daunting, too.
	   ``In the past, black people thought that their language and
culture were inferior,'' says Sema, the teacher. ``That's why we
are lacking in development.''

Lives of sage's Egyptian followers gleaned from papyrus, wood

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISMANT EL-KHARAB, Egypt (AP) _ It is an eye-straining job for
religion professor Iain Gardner.
	   He pieces together 1,700-year-old wood and papyrus fragments
from books and scrolls _ recovering the teachings of an ancient
religion founded by Mani, a Persian once revered from North Africa
to China.
	   ``It is like a jigsaw puzzle,'' Gardner said.
	   First, he reads the Old Coptic text, then uses clues like
handwriting or a fragment's shape to identify which word fits which
line. Ultimately the lines become pages.
	   Gardner is part of a scientific team working on the Dakhleh
Oasis Project, which has traced the anthropological record of the
oasis in Egypt's vast Western Desert back hundreds of thousands of
years.
	   About 5,000 writing fragments have been found so far at the site
of a town founded 2,000 years ago and known in ancient times as
Kellis and today as Ismant el-Kharab.
	   The pieces _ the smallest is the size of a thumbnail _ are rare
testaments of Manichaeism, a creed that disappeared by the 14th
century. Among its followers was the theologian St. Augustine, an
adherent for nine years before he turned to Christianity _ and
against Manichaeism.
	   Mani believed he was the successor of Jesus. He put together
elements from Christianity, Buddhism and Iran's fire-glorifying
Zoroastrianism.
	   His writings in Syriac, an ancient language of the Middle East,
were all lost. But the majority of those that had been translated
into Old Coptic or Greek survived destruction by Christians, who
considered Mani and his followers heretics.
	   Manichaeism, a faith of dualism, called for freeing the good _
or light _ trapped in human bodies regarded as inherently evil, or
dark. Mani was considered an emissary of light who encouraged his
followers to release the good in themselves.
	   ``May also the right hand of light guard: and save you from
every evil assault and from the snares of the world,'' says an
excerpt from Mani's Fundamental Epistle.
	   Mani traveled wide to spread the faith. He died in prison at
about age 60 after he returned to Iran in A.D. 276. Zoroastrian
priests, seeing Mani as a threat to their status, wanted to get rid
of him. After he died, his body was flayed and hung on a prison
wall.
	   In Kellis, the Manichaeans left behind pots, tools and their
religious writings. Most of the fragments found come from a single
building that archaeologists call simply House Three.
	   The writings scrawled in black ink were ``not splendid or
ornate,'' said Gardner, who heads the School of Studies in Religion
at the University of Sydney in Australia and teaches early
Christianity.
	   But they are ``quite unique ... and very important to
scholars,'' he said. Personal and business letters also were found.
	   A few other Manichaean texts are kept at the Chester Beatty
Library in Dublin, Ireland, and the Egyptian Museum in Berlin.
Others have been found in Central Asia and China.
	   ``But the ones found in Kellis have more variety and are within
their context,'' Gardner said, noting the others were moved far
from where they were discovered.
	   Kellis now is a desolate site of ruined mudbrick walls and stubs
of round columns. Thousands of pieces of pottery shards, some
colored in pale blue and white, crunch under foot.
	   During the town's thriving past, a temple celebrated one of
Egypt's old gods, Tutu. A church, believed to be one of the oldest
in Egypt, was built in the 4th century.
	   Although Manichaeism was banned during the Roman Empire in the
4th century, Gardner said Manichaeism may have lasted in the
Western Desert until the 7th century.
	   Judging by what they're finding, the archaeologists believe the
Manichaeans were able to live an ordinary life side by side with
Christians, perhaps because Kellis was far from potential
persecutors _ the authorities based in the Nile Valley.
	   Some writings found in the ruins were simply shopping lists
calling for buying wheat, lentils and chicken.
	   ``Many of the letters are from family members with lots of
greetings to aunts,'' Gardner said. ``Often the men were away on
trade in the Nile Valley and they wrote letters to their wives and
sisters in Dakhleh.''
	   Kellis still promises many surprises.
	   Gardner, who took four years to complete the first volume of
Manichaean texts in 1996, expects to spend five years on a second
volume and plans two further ones.
	   And beyond House Three, up to 100 other houses still need to be
properly excavated.
	   ``A great majority is still largely untouched,'' Gardner said.
``One could carry on forever.''

Dollar higher in Tokyo, Japanese stocks fall
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices slipped in early trading
Friday on profit-taking after four straight days of gains. The U.S.
dollar rose slightly higher against the yen.
	   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 121.48 points, or 0.73
percent, to 16,610.44 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On
Thursday, the Nikkei average gained 117.78 points, or 0.71 percent.
	   Share prices were knocked lower by profit-taking and position
adjustment ahead of a 3-day holiday weekend, traders said. The
index posted gains for the past four straight sessions, rallying
641.86 points, or 4.0 percent.
	   Financial markets in Tokyo will be closed Monday for Japan's
Marine Day holiday.
	   Thursday's late surge in stock prices came following reports
former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama may become a
candidate for prime minister to replace Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is
resigning.
	   Kajiyama is viewed as aggressive on the economy after his
instrumental role in developing recent measures to stabilize
Japan's beleaguered banking system.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party elder has stressed in the
past that radical measures are needed to boost growth in Japan's
slumping economy.
	   Both Kajiyama and Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi were expected to
formally announce their candidacies for the top job later Friday.
	   Hashimoto announced Monday that he would resign because of the
Liberal Democrats' humiliating loss in elections for Parliament's
upper house. His conservative party, however, still controls the
government because of its majority in the more powerful lower
house.
	   The LDP plans to name Hashimoto's replacement next week, and
Parliament was expected to vote a new prime minister into office by
month's end.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was also down, losing 3.10 points, or 0.24 percent,
to 1,277.63. The TOPIX closed up 5.42 points, or 0.42 percent, the
day before.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 139.98 yen in
early trading, up 0.26 yen from 139.72 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo
and also above its late New York rate of 139.94 yen overnight.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 192 10-year Japanese
government bond fell to 1.430 percent from Wednesday's finish of
1.435 percent, driving its price up to 110.19 yen from 110.16 yen.

Columns in the kitchen, tears on cobblestones: Rome's past lives on

	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ This is another in the occasional series, 'At
the Millennium,' which examines social, cultural, scientific and
geopolitical issues up to and beyond the year 2000.
 &UR; AP Photos NY321-325, AP Graphic VIA DEL PORTICO
 &UR; By FRANCES D'EMILIO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   ROME (AP) _ In her spartan apartment, Rosa Limentani is at home
with the 2000-year-old stone column wedged between her washing
machine and refrigerator.
	   The ruin survives from a portico of 300 columns built by Emperor
Augustus as a monument to his sister, Octavia, and an impressive
entrance to the Marcellus Theater where free entertainment once
drew 20,000 spectators.
	   Another column, or half of it, bulges from the bedroom wall.
	   Turn just about any corner in Rome, and you stumble onto a piece
of history _ maybe a delicately carved sarcophagus now used as a
drinking fountain, or a fragment of frieze distinguishing one
neighbor's mail slot from another.
	   But those are just hiccups from the past compared with this
corner of history.
	   The Old Ghetto is home to one of the world's longest
continuously-inhabited Jewish communities. Inhaling and exhaling
history along its lifeline and main street, Via del Portico
d'Ottavia, its vitality has filled two millenniums and awaits a
third.
	   The presence of Jews in Rome dates to the 2nd century B.C. Some
of the early Jews arrived after 70 A.D., when Titus brought more
than 6,000 slaves from the conquest of Jerusalem. The victory was
celebrated by a triumphal arch in the emperor's honor at the edge
of the Roman Forum.
	   ``Here you really have the sensation that the past is still
present, that the past never ended,'' says Rome historian Anna Foa.
``There is an ancientness of places, of stone, of space that has
been handed down unchanged right up to today.''
	   Here, not only do ruins from more than 20 centuries crop up in
cellars and intrude on lives, but many residents themselves are
part of history.
	   Rosa Limentani was 19 on Oct. 16, 1943, when soldiers from the
German occupation went door to door, grabbing old men in pajamas,
women with overcoats thrown over nightgowns and sleepy children
wrapped in blankets.
	   It was the start of a journey that would take 1,022 Italian Jews
in boxcars to Auschwitz. Only 14 men and one woman came back.
	   Rosa lived because an Austrian soldier took pity and let her
slip away in the confusion convulsing Via del Portico d'Ottavia. A
few others survived on the kindness and courage of Romans outside
the neighborhood, like the tram driver who let a father and young
daughter hop on at a nearby terminus and drove them, the only
passengers, to safety.
	   After such brushes with history, living intimately with
architectural relics can seem unremarkable.
	   ``So, you think it's something special to have columns in your
house?'' asks Rosa, boiling up tomatoes, carrots and broccoli for
soup for her ailing husband.
	   After decades of hearing tourists ask permission to climb the 38
marble steps for a peek inside, Rosa is beginning to believe
something must be unusual about her apartment.
	    &UR; ___
	   Some residents are old enough to remember an American
sociologist who came to Via del Portico d'Ottavia right after World
War II. He wanted to study this rare example of a neighborhood that
endured for centuries.
	   By the 16th century, when a Counter-Reformation pope, Paul IV,
ordered Jews confined to the quarter, the neighborhood was already
crowded with Spanish refugees expelled by Queen Isabella in 1492.
	   Four centuries of living jammed together under papal edicts
cemented solidarity that survived after ghetto walls were torn down
in 1842.
	   ``This community, like an enclave, maintained its particular
character, untouched and undisturbed by events, even though some of
the events were very tragic,'' says Tullia Zevi, president of the
Union of Italian Jewish Communities.
	   When the weather calls for no more than a cardigan, Rosa and her
friends gather at dusk outside Mrs. Zevi's building. They bring
their own chairs and sit and chat about new great-grandchildren and
old sorrows.
	   ``These cobblestones were bathed in tears and blood,'' says
friend Rosie Piazza.
	   Embedded in the portico, about six yards (meters) away, is St.
Angelo in Pescheria. For several centuries, Jews were forced to
listen to Christian sermons in this church. These days, Catholics
fill the pews for a Saturday evening Mass with guitar music and
lots of hand-clapping.
	   ``We went through ugly, ugly times, more ugly than beautiful,
but we still have warmth,'' adds Piazza, who's like a sister to
Rosa.
	   Last summer, Italian director Ettore Scola shot a documentary
with actors in German uniforms. Some residents had walk-on roles.
	   ``Just seeing the soldiers gave us the shivers,'' recalls Gina,
who wears a neck chain with the Star of David.
	    &UR; ___
	   In 212 A.D., Emperor Caracalla gave Jews the right to
citizenship, and with it the privilege of living in the city's
walled-off center. Many of them, working in commerce, settled near
Portico d'Ottavia, close to the docks on the River Tiber, and
assimilated into community life. A few even served as physicians to
the popes.
	   Some single out the fierce pride of Roman Jews as citizens of
the Eternal City as one reason why so many stayed when the Germans
occupied the capital. Even though Benito Mussolini's 1938
anti-Jewish laws made them second-class citizens, the Jews felt
rooted.
	   ``The Roman Jews of the Old Ghetto considered themselves more
Roman than the Romans themselves,'' journalist Fausto Coen wrote in
his book, ``16 ottobre 1943,'' ``because they still were living
where 2,000 years before their ancestors made their home.''

	   Next to the soaring Art Deco synagogue along the Tiber is the
Museum of Jewish Art. Busloads of tourists, many of them Americans,
tour the museum, admiring Torah covers in faded, pastel brocades,
hanging from racks like the dresses in the district's wholesale
garment shops.
	   But it is the sad souvenirs of history that stop most visitors.
	   Among these is a yellowed report to Col. Herbert Kappler
protesting a Nazi demand for 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of gold. A
museum case displays a typed plea from a community leader
explaining that the Jews could not come up with so much gold even
if they turned in all their tie clips and wedding bands.
	   Kappler's reply: ``Whether enrolled in the community or
disassociated, baptized or mixed, all those in whose veins course a
drop of Jewish blood are all the same for me _ they are all
enemies.''
	   Next to the report are receipts for the gold.
	    &UR; __
	   When Holy Days near, Jews flock to the Ghetto from all around
Rome. As Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year, approaches this fall,
cars, as always, will be triple-parked down Via Portico d'Ottavia
outside Boccione's, a wedge of a pastry shop.
	   There's no store name outside, but the regulars know where to go
_ the corner of the 15th-century building where Lorenzo Manilio
engraved his name again and again and decorated the facade with an
Imperial-age marble relief of a lion pouncing on a buck.
	   For the holy days, Boccione's bakes trays full of mezzaluna,
crescent cakes glazed with white sugar.
	   ``How many years have we been here?'' asks owner Graziella
Limentani. ``One hundred? 150 years? I really can't remember.''
	   Now in her 70s, she never has much time to chat. Customers
speed-order ricotta cakes filled with cream so rich and sticky that
it oozes as a granddaughter slices.
	   Mrs. Limentani took over the business at 22, when her parents
were deported, and hasn't stopped since.
	    &UR; __-
	   At No. 29 Via del Portico d'Ottavia, a plaque recalls the 1943
roundup. Now the site is occupied by the superintendency of
archaeology, a brick building reassembled when Mussolini made the
area around Marcellus Theater more ``imperial.''
	   As part of the makeover, Mussolini ordered the demolition of
merchant shops that existed since medieval times in the theater's
archways. Now, from time to time, archaeologists inspect
neighborhood houses to ensure that the remains of the past are not
lost to remodeling.
	   Rosie Piazza once lived in the medieval house that juts against
the portico, still tidy with lace curtains and pots of red
geraniums. Today, that house, inhabited by others, is popular as a
photo op.
	   Like Rosa, Rosie had a portico column, dividing kitchen from
living room. A bedroom windowsill was fashioned from a carved
sarcophagus.
	   She remembers how archaeologists once asked her and her mother
to scrape off paint they used to dress up the column.
	   Now, some six decades later, diners at da Giggetto, an outdoor
trattoria up the block from the portico, eat Jewish-style
artichokes and watch. Four yards below the sidewalk, archaeologists
dig out a cluster of medieval businesses and houses buried by
layers of pavement as Rome built up throughout the ages.
	   A fish market was excavated, complete with mussel and oyster
shells, testifying to ``pescheria'' in the name of the church, St.
Angelo in Pescheria.
	    &UR; ___
	   ``Tradition lives on this street. The street is really a piazza,
a meeting place,'' says Michele Sonnino, who, a couple of years
ago, opened a ``Kasher'' pizza place on the far end of the street.
	   Youngsters from the local school drift in for lunch with shouts
of ``Hey, Michele'' and longing looks at his round creations of
pliable crust, topped with crumbled beef sausage, slivers of white
mushrooms and cherry tomatoes as big as plums.
	   On this street, Sonnino adds, ``You find a sense of family, a
sense of protection. Kids play in the street. There's no drug
problem.''
	   That close-knit sense of a small, safe village has made Via del
Portico d'Ottavia one of the most desirable addresses in Rome. One
television director recently bought a penthouse with terrace in an
old monastery with crooked, stone stairs instead of an elevator.
	   Romans hoping to buy are quick to snap up apartments along the
street and side alleys. But for-sale signs are rare here, in this
neighborhood that anchors its future on its past.

Lightning sign free agent Wendel Clark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAMPA Florida (AP) _ After losing out in the Doug Gilmour and
Ron Francis free-agent sweepstakes, the Tampa Bay Lightning turned
to former Toronto left wing Wendel Clark to address their offensive
woes.
	   The Lightning signed the unrestricted free agent Thursday to a
one-year, dlrs 1.5 million contract with a team option for a second
season. The deal also includes a games-played incentive bonus for
the oft-injured forward.
	   ``Wendel is to us as good a signing as Doug Gilmour,'' general
manager Phil Esposito said. ``Wendel is a guy with leadership and
the ability to motivate other players by the way he plays.''
	   Clark, 31, was taken first overall in the 1985 entry draft by
the Maple Leafs. The 13-year veteran has 294 career goals, but has
appeared in 50 or less games in six of his National Hockey League
seasons.
	   He said he was excited about moving to Tampa Bay, even though
the Lightning had the NHL's worst record last season.
	   ``It's intriguing that it's in a rebuilding situation, and I can
go down there and prove I can still play and also help out a hockey
club that's building for the future,'' Clark said. ``They have the
building blocks to progress quickly up the ladder.''
	   Last season, Clark was slowed by a groin injury that required
surgery in April. In 47 games, the five-time 30-goal scorer had 12
goals.
	   ``As far as off-ice, I'm 100 percent right now,'' Clark said.
``There's no problem with anything. Later in July I will start
skating and do the other things I do when I'm healthy.''
	   Lightning coach Jacques Demers said Clark will be placed on one
of the team's top two lines and also will be part of the power-play
unit.
	   ``We won't have the same Wendel Clark as ten years ago, but we
have a character player respected throughout the NHL,'' Demers
said.
	   Clark's best season came during the 1993-94 season in Toronto
when he scored 46 goals and added 30 assists.
	   Clark becomes the third key off-season acquisition, joining
former Phoenix center Craig Janney and Washington goaltender Bill
Ranford, who were obtained in trades.

Asia crisis plunged fastest growing economies into recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Thanks to the Asian financial crisis,
world economic growth is estimated to fall to 2.5 percent this
year, after two straight years of better-than 3 percent growth,
according to the 1998 World Economic and Social Survey.
	   The survey, released Thursday, found that developing countries
have been hardest hit by the turmoil, with growth not expected to
exceed 3 percent after an average of 5 percent or better growth in
five of the last six years.
	   Industrialized economies are projected to grow by an average
2.25 percent, down from a decade-high 2.7 percent last year. The
so-called transition economies of Eastern Europe are expected to
grow by 3 percent after 2.7 percent growth last year, the survey
said.
	   The Asian crisis led the survey's authors to questions the
widely held belief that fully liberalized markets should be the
goal for developing countries.
	   They noted the failure of East Asian banks to handle an overflow
of capital, the switch in investor perception of East Asian
economies as powerhouses, and the tendency of markets to transmit
rather than absorb losses.
	   ``What is needed at this time ... is not more decontrol and
deregulation but more effective official oversight and market-based
controls of financial markets,'' the survey said.
	   The survey found weaknesses in official oversight of three
nations at the epicenter of the Asian crisis _ Thailand, South
Korea and Indonesia _ as well as the rescue programs developed for
the countries by the International Monetary Fund.
	   According to the study, Japan's economy _ the world's
second-largest which grew at .9 percent in 1997 _ ``will, in
essence, stagnate for yet another year in what has been a very
disappointing decade.''
	   In East Asia, fallout from the crisis which began in the region
last year is expected to depress growth to about 1 percent, down
from about 5.5 percent in 1997.
	   ``In a sense, even this outlook is optimistic,'' the survey
said, because it assumes continued stabilization, an unchanged
exchange rate in China and that the Japanese economy won't fall
into a deeper recession.
	   Economic activity in Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand is
expected to contract in 1998 by 1 to 4 percent. A range of 3.5
percent to 6 percent is predicted for Hong Kong, Singapore and
Taiwan.
	   Growth in China, which was about 9 percent in 1997, is expected
to reach about 8 percent but the survey noted uncertainty about
that estimate.
	   Strong growth continues in North America, allowing for more
employment, but the survey cautioned about possible corrections in
the stock and bond markets. U.S. growth, almost 4 percent last
year, is projected to be 2.7 percent this year, though the fallout
of the Asian crisis could hurt U.S. exports.
	   In Europe, Britain and Northern Ireland's economies are expected
to slow to about 2.3 percent from about 3 percent last year.
Exports helped growth in both France and Germany, where currency
depreciations of about 15 percent boosted experts.
	   Among eastern Europe's transition economies, Poland has been the
most dynamic since 1994, with average annual growth of about 6
percent. That is expected to continue.
	   Russia showed its first signs of improvement in 1997 _ .4
percent growth. But because of recent turmoil in Russian markets, a
1 percent growth estimate could be overestimated, the survey said.
	   Argentina, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Peru led
the region with average rates of growth of between 7 and 8.4
percent. GDP in Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country, stagnated
and Jamaica was the only regional economy that recorded a decline
in output.

<TEXT>
	   WICKFORD, Rhode Island (AP) _ Out on the sunshiny blue Pacific,
a boy named Briac climbed sleepy-eyed from the cabin just as his
wooden sailboat crossed the dotted line that separates northern and
southern hemispheres.
	   His father warned him what might happen on this special day.
King Neptune could appear on deck, a rite of passage for those who
navigate across the equator.
	   For days, the 5-year-old boy with wind-tousled hair fretted.
Would Neptune be as grouchy as he looked in picture books?
	   As foretold, Briac clambered onto the deck to find the king of
the oceans _ wearing a white beard, clutching a trident, and
sitting on a throne.
	   Neptune presented Briac with a proclamation, welcoming him to
join boastful seafarers. The mighty Neptune was a benevolent king,
after all.
	   Does this sound like a fairy tale? Well, the boy is real. So is
the boat, the Spray of St. Briac.
	   But Neptune isn't. It's Briac Bernardin's dad, Guy, wearing a
beard of shaving cream and grasping a harpoon, upright on a plastic
patio chair.
	   Though born on land, in Newport, Rhode Island, Briac has spent
most of his life at sea, sailing with his parents twice across the
Atlantic and once around the world.
	   Since setting out in 1992, Briac and his family have logged
56,000 miles (90,120 kilometers) aboard their 37-foot (11.2-meter)
vessel.
	   Briac sleeps in a tiny bunk, comforted by stuffed animals. On a
shelf nearby is ``The Little Prince,'' one of his favorite books.
Like the prince, Briac loves an adventure. Living at sea gives him
plenty.
	   Briac's home, this boat, is a replica of a yawl that Joshua
Slocum sailed around the world 100 years ago. His playground is the
deck, where he spends hours each day making up stories about
pirates and heroic sea captains.
	   Briac also goes to school on deck, his lessons drawn daily from
textbooks donated by a school in France. He likes to sit at the
table and pretend he's riding a bus to school. One morning, as his
mother waited for him to open his books, Briac told her: ``I'm late
because there was a snowstorm.''
	   It's good to have a lively imagination aboard the Spray of St.
Briac because this home doesn't have a TV, VCR or stereo. It also
lacks some conveniences.
	   With no bathtub, the family takes sponge-baths on deck. Clothes
get washed in a bucket. Raindrops on the mainsail provide water to
drink. Light comes from two kerosene lanterns, heat from a wood
stove.
	   When Guy and Mitzi Bernardin set out on the high seas they
wanted Briac to learn, with the sea as teacher, that life cannot be
taken for granted. ``To start life like this,'' says Guy, ``it's a
good start to be a man.''
	   The Spray of St. Briac arrived in Rhode Island early last month,
ending an around-the-world voyage. Early this month, the Bernardins
were off again, harbor-hopping before setting out across the
Atlantic. In between, at a Wickford marina, they put the boat up on
jack stands so they could paint the hull.
	   On land, Briac sanded a spar his dad had removed. Then, in less
time than it takes to read this sentence, Briac tied a perfect
bowline. ``Do you like the knot?'' he asked in his parents' native
French. He smiled up from his white sailor hat.
	   Guy Bernardin, 54, was raised in the French port of St. Briac,
for whom his son and his boat are named. His wife, 48, was also
born in France. He was a restaurant manager, she a flight attendant
when they met in New York City in 1972.
	   Guy raced sailboats, soloing three times around the world and
six times past the stormy Cape Horn. One day, he nearly died there
when the mast of his sleek racer snapped and the boat sank.
	   Chilean sailors pulled him from a raft. After a second rescue,
Guy figured it was ``time to relax a little.'' So Briac lived for
about a year with his parents in North Kingstown, on the western
shore of Narragansett Bay.
	   Then Guy reread ``Alone Around the World,'' a book written by
Slocum about his voyage from 1895 to 1898. It was the first such
trip, or at least the first recorded trip, solo.
	   Guy decided to mark Slocum's 100th anniversary by recreating it.
In preparation, the Bernardins sold house and belongings, bought a
pine-and-oak replica of The Spray, moored it in Wickford, and took
up residence.

	   In 1992, they sailed for France to test their boat's
seaworthiness. Whenever Mitzi took the wheel, year-old Briac was
never far behind, snug in a backpack intended for infants.
	   After a year in France, they sailed to Portugal, Honduras and
Guatemala before returning to Rhode Island in May 1995. Two months
later, the family set out to sail the world.
	   ``I'm not saying I had no fear,'' says Mitzi. ``But if you think
too much about anything, you won't go anywhere. There can be danger
in everything that you do.''
	   And there was.
	   In July 1995, the Spray of St. Briac ran into a storm near the
Azores. Rolling seas and high winds buffeted the vessel, and it
bobbed like a beach ball as Guy, Mitzi and Briac stayed inside the
cabin. The wind blew until it could blow no more.
	   The Bernardins stayed in Portugal for a year to avoid bad
weather. But one night, a great wind blew the vessel onto a
sandbar, waking Briac and Mitzi. They scampered out of the cabin,
and the boat came to rest at a steep angle.
	   Eventually they all sailed back across the Atlantic, toward
destinations already famous among peg-legged pirates and ancient
mariners. On the other side of the Panama Canal, dolphins followed
them along their westerly course.
	   It was here that King Neptune appeared on board and welcomed
Briac to the Southern Hemisphere. And it was here that Briac was
relieved to recognize his dad beneath the foamy beard.
	   Time can seem suspended aboard a vessel like the Spray of St.
Briac. Unlike modern counterparts, the Bernardins' boat is unable
to sail upwind. So they must wait for a wind to come along and push
the boat in the direction they have chosen.
	   The wait can be tedious. It can also be glorious. Adrift in the
middle of an ocean, the three catch tuna, read in the sun and feast
on sushi.
	   Last year, the Bernardins anchored in South Africa just before
Christmas. Briac played with children aboard other yachts and swam
near Cape Town. As on previous Christmas Eves, Santa found the boat
and Briac discovered gift-wrapped toys next to the mast below deck.
	   On the last leg of the journey round the world, the Spray of St.
Briac sailed to Puerto Rico, and one day Briac took his pet cat for
a sail around the harbor in the boat's wooden dinghy. ``He tacks
just like an old sea captain,'' says Guy.
	   Their journey over, the Bernardins are still aboard the Spray of
St. Briac, heading for Portugal to join the World Expo.
	   After that, Guy and Mitzi plan to send Briac to a real school
and provide a home on solid ground. ``We will have to explain to
him that living on land is different than living on a boat,'' says
Guy.
	   Briac likes the idea of living on land for awhile.
	   But the sea seems to be his destiny.
	   When Briac lets his thoughts drift like cotton-candy clouds, he
imagines a man at the wheel of a ship.
	   The sailor is Briac Bernardin, now grown, and the fearless
captain of the Spray of St. Briac.

Novotna wins, exhibition loses another player _ Mirjana Lucic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ The A and P Tennis Classic is becoming
more well known for players not showing up than the presence of
Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna and Steffi Graf.
	   A day after Russian teen-age sensation Anna Kournikova withdrew
after aggravating a thumb injury, Croatian teen-ager Mirjana Lucic
backed out because of a fever related to a bout with chicken pox,
event director John Korff said late Thursday.
	   Lucic, ranked No. 44 in the world, developed the chicken pox
before Wimbledon, where she lost in the first round to Serena
Williams.
	   Lucic, who has a three-year contract to play in this event, was
to play Graf on Friday night in a quarterfinal match.
	   Korff said that Graf will now play the loser of the USTA
Challenger match being held on Friday morning between top-seeded
Fang Li of China and No. 2 Amy Frazier of Rochester Hills,
Michigan.
	   The winner of the challenger match will advance to the
semifinals Saturday and will play the winner of the Graf match.
	   The other semifinal will feature Novotna and Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa.
	   Novotna, who won her first Grand Slam event by winning Wimbledon
less than two weeks ago, advanced to the semifinals on Thursday
night by beating South Africa's Mariaan de Swardt, Kournikova's
replacement, 6-3, 6-4. Coetzer beat Lisa Raymond in a quarterfinal
on Wednesday.
	   ``You can't get frustrated, they're injured,'' Korff said of the
withdrawals. ``This happens in tennis all the time.''
	   Kournikova, who sprained ligaments in her right thumb at
Eastbourne the week before Wimbledon, showed up on Thursday for an
interview and an appearance for the crowd before the Novotna match.
	   Korff said Kournikova was paid expenses and a little money for
the trip from Detroit, but she did not get her six-figure
appearance fee.
	   ``Like I said I wanted to come here for the fans,'' said
Kournikova, who wore tight denim pants and a halter top. ``I'm
really disappointed I can't play but I had to do something.''
	   Graf also is fighting an infection, Korff said, but she is
expected to play. The German is currently ranked No. 57 after being
sidelined with a knee injury.
	   Graf lost in the third round at Wimbledon to Natasha Zvereva.
She isn't predicting when her game will be back.
	   ``I'm taking it one tournament after the other,'' Graf said.
``That's one of the other things I learned, to wait and see and
play. If I'll be able to play all these tournaments and, hopefully,
feel more secure and feel more confident about my game, we'll see
what happens. But, it's, for me, a little far away right now.''

<TEXT>
	   LONG GROVE, Illinois (AP) _ Michael Jordan all but said he was
retiring Thursday while reiterating that he wouldn't play for any
coach other than Phil Jackson, who left the Chicago Bulls last
month.
	   Jordan said he wouldn't make an official announcement about his
status with the Bulls until after the National Basketball
Association's lockout ends.
	   ``I'll wait until the situation (lockout) gets settled, making
sure in my mind,'' said Jordan, who talked to reporters after
playing in a pro-am golf tournament.
	   ``I feel that way right now. Ask me in two or three months and I
may change. I don't think I will. I'm pretty sure that's my
decision.''
	   He also said he wouldn't play for a college coach or a young
coach like Iowa State's Tim Floyd, who is the leading candidate to
replace Jackson.
	   ``I've always stuck to my guns. I always said I would not play
without Phil Jackson. I haven't changed that,'' Jordan said. ``I
just haven't made an official announcement. I won't make that until
the time comes.''
	   Jordan's comments came a day after Bulls chairman Jerry
Reinsdorf said he talked to his star about the coaching candidates
before the lockout began. But Reinsdorf said he wouldn't give
Jordan veto power, adding that he would not hire a coach who
couldn't work with the five-time MVP.
	   ``We're not going to get a coach who would have a difficult time
coaching Michael Jordan, but Michael's not the kind of guy who
wants to run a franchise,'' Reinsdorf said Wednesday. ``He doesn't
want to select a coach. He doesn't want to veto any coaches. So I
don't think that's a big issue.
	   ``I think I understand Michael. I would be foolish to hire
somebody without feeling confident that this is somebody that
Michael could play for.''
	   Jordan said he didn't want to tell Bulls management who their
new coach should be. But he made it clear again the only coach he
would play for _ other than former North Carolina coach Dean Smith
_ is Jackson.
	   ``Jerry Reinsdorf has always made his own choices. Whatever
choices he makes, it doesn't force me to play for his choices,''
Jordan said. ``I'm not going to be unhappy not playing the game of
basketball.
	   ``He made his stance on Phil Jackson, and that pretty much makes
my stance.''
	   After the Bulls won their sixth title in June, Jackson declined
an offer to return for another year.
	   Jordan said he hasn't talked to Jackson, who is vacationing in
Turkey and has already said he planned to take the rest of the year
off and spend it away from basketball.
	   ``Phil is not holding me hostage and I'm not holding him
hostage. I'm not trying to hold Scottie Pippen hostage or Jerry
Reinsdorf,'' Jordan said.
	   ``Whatever decisions they make, they are going to do that
anyway. I'll make my own decisions. If it doesn't coincide, so be
it.''
	   Jordan said he felt his input wasn't highly valued in the
selection of a new coach who could be named within a week or so.
	   ``It's very obvious my feelings weren't considered when they
made their coaching decision,'' Jordan said.
	   As a free agent, Jordan said he was not interested in playing
for another NBA team.
	   ``I've always wanted to retire as a Bull,'' he said. ``I'm not
even going to consider going to another organization.''
	   Asked what he would do after walking away a second time, Jordan
said he wasn't sure. He first retired in October 1993 after his
father was murdered, experimented with baseball and returned 17
months later.
	   Jordan said this time he would be satisfied to leave after
leading the Bulls to a sixth title in eight years, winning a 10th
scoring title, a fifth MVP and a sixth NBA Finals MVP title.

Mother of three brothers killed in firebombings remembers her boys
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ In her first public interview,
the mother of three young brothers killed in a sectarian
firebombing tearfully said she feels guilty about the deaths.
	   ``I do. I wish I hadn't stayed there,'' Chrissie Quinn, 29, said
in an interview that was to be aired later Friday on the morning
news channel GMTV.
	   Authorities say they believe the Quinn household _ located in a
staunchly Protestant housing complex in Ballymoney, about 40 miles
(65 kms) northwest of Belfast _ was targeted because the boys'
Catholic mother lived there with her Protestant boyfriend.
	   Ms. Quinn noted that the family had fled to England once after
being harassed for being Catholic, but that the boys wanted to be
with their friends and she felt they would be safe, since she was
raising them as Protestants.
	   She said she had no intention, however, of leaving Northern
Ireland. She nodded when asked if that was to allow her to be near
the gravesite of the three boys.
	   Ms. Quinn described the brothers _ Richard, 11, Mark, 10, and
Jason, 9 _ as mischievous boys who were ``into everything.''
	   ``Richard was a devil, but he had a big heart,'' she said.
``Jason was a good wean (wee one), Mark was a good wean. They were
just boys. They were into everything, but everybody liked them.''
	   She recalled that her last memory of her sons was the sound of
their shouts when she awoke to find the family home ablaze.
	   ``I woke up to smoke. The kids were in their bedroom. I heard
them and I went to them and they weren't there,'' she said. ``I
shall always remember that.''
	   Her only surviving child, 12-year-old Lee, sat next to her
during the interview, which took place at the house of Ms. Quinn's
mother in Rasharkin. Lee was sleeping over at his grandmother's the
night of the firebombing.
	   Asked if she believed their deaths would change anything in
Northern Ireland, she said in an almost inaudible voice: ``No.''
	   Tensions spilling over from a Protestant march blocked since
July 5 near Portadown, 60 miles (100 kms) southwest of Ballymoney,
were blamed for the Sunday morning firebombing of the Quinn house.
	   Ms. Quinn agreed, saying of the standoff, ``It has everything to
do with it.'' Asked if she blamed members of the Protestant Orange
Order, she nodded.
	   Police investigating the boys' deaths announced a ``small
number'' of further arrests Thursday. The suspects join one man
detained earlier in the week; another was released without charge
Wednesday.
	   Detectives provided no further details about the new arrests.
	   Also Thursday, the man supervising the handover of terrorist
weapons as part of Northern Ireland's peace agreement said he
believed paramilitary groups would meet the May 2000
decommissioning target date listed in the accord.
	   ``Our perspective is that it is going to happen and, we feel,
sooner rather than later,'' Canada Gen. Jean de Chastelain told BBC
Radio Ulster.
	   De Chastelain said he would like to see some weapons handed over
before the new Belfast Assembly reconvenes Sept. 14.

Japan Inc. urged to scrap outmoded management to buoy economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In a bid to pull the economy out of its prolonged
slump, Japan's chief economic agency called on Japan Inc. Friday to
boost productivity by scrapping cherished practices such as
lifetime employment.
	   The recommendation came in an unusually blunt assessment of the
economy compiled by the Economic Planning Agency, which also urged
the government to carry out further deregulation and major
financial and tax reforms.
	   ``Japanese corporations are now suffering from system fatigue,''
said Akira Furukawa, director of the EPA's domestic economy
research bureau, ahead of the release of the annual economic
report.
	   Citing a long-term downturn in industrial labor productivity,
the agency stressed the need to give companies more flexibility
over hiring and firing, but also for increasing the boardroom's
accountability to shareholders.
	   Traditional practices such as seniority-based promotion and cozy
corporate ties between related firms are not suited for promoting
growth in important new fields such as software development, the
report said.
	   ``Japanese business relationships based on long-term, implicit
contracts functioned well in an age when the advance consensus
could be secured among parties concerned,'' it said.
	   The agency also said, however, that some traditional elements of
the current system remain appropriate in the manufacturing sector.
	   The EPA report marks an abrupt departure from last year's
``white paper'' on the economy, which had confidently stated Japan
was on track for solid recovery and that injections of public
spending were no longer needed.
	   The much glummer assessment this year follows the government's
acknowledgement in June that the economy has slipped into recession
following several years of sluggish growth.
	   ``The Japanese economy is in a state of stagnation,'' the report
said in a curtly-worded mea culpa.
	   In addition to corporate structural problems, the EPA blamed the
economic malaise on a string of financial institution failures and
the spread of an economic crisis elsewhere in Asia.
	   Also weighing on the economy is a credit crunch triggered by
massive bad loans held by banks and an ill-timed government
decision to raise sales taxes last year while phasing out income
tax cuts, it said.
	   The agency called for quicker action to write-off banks'
non-performing loans, along with increased efforts to shore up
Japan's piecemeal welfare programs and underfunded social security
system.
	   ``Although these reforms involve a certain degree of pain, they
are imperative for the future of Japan,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ The three-day burial ceremony of
Russia's last emperor and his family has taken on many of the
trappings of a state funeral.
	   The ceremony will end with the burial of Czar Nicholas II, his
family and servants on Friday, the 80th anniversary of their
murders by Bolshevik revolutionaries.
	   Their remains were borne home to the imperial capital Thursday
and driven solemnly through the streets to the cathedral where they
will take their places alongside three centuries of Russian rulers.
	   President Boris Yeltsin changed his mind Thursday and announced
that he would attend the burial, suddenly elevating its status to
something closer to the grand state ceremony that had once been
foreseen.
	   ``The truth was concealed for 80 years,'' Yeltsin said.
``Nothing was said about it. And tomorrow, the truth should be
told, and I should take part.''
	   He will be joined by dozens of Romanov relatives of the czar,
diplomats from about 50 countries, other top Russian officials and
Prince Michael of Kent, who, as a member of the British royal
family, is also a distant relative of Russian royalty.
	   Among those not taking part will be Patriarch Alexy II, the head
of the Russian Orthodox Church, which has not yet recognized the
bones as those of the royal family.
	   Largely because of that, the actual burial ceremony in St.
Petersburg's Peter and Paul Cathedral will be relatively simple.
When they are interred, the priest will not use the names of the
deceased, even though their name plaques are already hanging on the
walls of the chapel.
	   Thousands of Russians stood in silence along St. Petersburg's
streets and river embankments Thursday as the czar's cortege passed
by.
	   A long line of dark green hearses glided past the imperial
capital's canals and palaces, saluted by cannon and honor guards.
	   ``We're watching history, the history of Russia,'' said
Alexandra Butina, 16, who brought her 9-year-old brother Semyon to
watch the cortege drive through the gates of the city's central
fortress.
	   The burial has reopened long-suppressed chapters of Russian
history, stirring fresh debate about the Bolshevik Revolution, the
Romanov dynasty, and the nature of national guilt and repentance.
	   It has been difficult to turn on a television in Russia this
week without seeing programs about the royal family, with archival
footage of Nicholas, his wife, Alexandra, and their children.
Russians who grew up in the Communist era knowing little about the
Romanovs are being inundated with their history.
	   Lyuba Novikova, a 37-year-old secretary, said she was surprised
by the depth of emotion she felt when she saw the hearses appear
over the arch of the Troitsky Bridge.
	   ``I cried,'' she said. ``I'm a simple person. I can't say why,
but I cried.''
	   But then she gave it another thought and added: ``It's like a
shadow has been over us, and now we hope things will be better for
Russia.''
	   Nicholas was the last of the Romanov emperors who ruled Russia
for 300 years. After abdicating in 1917 in the throes of the
Russian Revolution, he was murdered on July 17, 1918, along with
Alexandra, their five children and four servants.
	   Bolshevik zealots who carried out the killings then tried to
erase all traces of the corpses.
	   After the collapse of the Soviet Union, nine of the 11 bodies
were recovered from a desolate forest outside the Ural Mountains
city of Yekaterinburg and subjected to years of painstaking tests
to confirm their identification.
	   The burial ceremonies began Wednesday in Yekaterinburg, when the
bones were taken from the city's police morgue and placed in small,
skeleton-sized coffins.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economy shows few signs of recovery amid
weak consumer spending, low corporate investment and sluggish
exports, the Economic Planning Agency said in its monthly report
issued Friday.
	   For a sixth consecutive month, Japan's chief economic agency
said the economy remains stuck in a period of stagnation, noting
declining housing investment, capital spending, imports and
exports.
	   Agency officials said the economic situation could improve as
soon as next month from the impact of supplemental government
spending, but private economists remain wary.
	   ``There is absolutely no good news,'' Jesper Koll, JP Morgan
Securities Asia Ltd. research head, said of the EPA report.

Predictions of Australia recession ``too gloomy,'' says Howard
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday predictions that Australia is sliding into recession are
``too gloomy'' and that the government's economic forecasts have
not been revised lower.
	   In newspaper reports Friday, economic forecaster Dun &AMP;
Bradstreet warned that economic growth in Australia will be weaker
than at any time in the past two years, and that there's a 50
percent chance of the country going into recession.
	   ``I think that's too gloomy, but we are obviously being affected
by the Asian downturn,'' Howard said in a radio interview.
	   The government hasn't revised its economic growth forecasts,
though the possibility of a revision is always open, he said.
	   Howard said he hasn't decided when the next federal election
will be held. He said the government would release its tax reform
package soon.
	   The unveiling of the tax package is thought to be the precursor
to national elections, due by May 1999 but which could be called at
any time.
	   ``I don't know when the election is going to be,'' Howard said.
``We're going to release the tax policy soon, and we'll spend a lot
of time explaining that to the Australian public.''
	   The tax package is widely expected to include a broad-based
consumption tax.
	   Howard is facing an emerging rift in the ruling conservative
coalition over the tax package and the full privatization of the
national telecommunications carrier, Telstra Corp.
	   Senior members of junior coalition partner, the rural-based
National Party, have warned Howard that many country voters will
not support the Telstra sale, and that a consumption tax would
disadvantage rural people.
	   They say the fledgling right-wing populist One Nation party will
continue to make inroads into the coalition's traditional support
base if the tax and Telstra policies are pursued, and have warned
of a split with Howard's Liberal party.
	   Howard downplayed the rift and vowed to pursue the reforms.
	   ``I don't think the coalition is in any danger at all. There's
nothing strange about individual members (of the government) having
disagreements with a position taken by the government,'' he said.
	   ``I will continue to do what I believe is good for Australia,
irrespective of the political consequences.''
	   But outspoken National lawmaker Bob Katter said the coalition
may collapse if the government pursues policies unpopular in rural
regions.
	   ``If the prime minister is determined to act in a manner that is
detrimental to people living in regional Australia then the
coalition is in great trouble,'' Katter said in a television
interview.

After cease-fire, U.N. ready to deliver food to starving Sudanese

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ With a cease-fire in place, the United
Nations says it is ready to bring desperately needed relief to
thousands of starving people in southern Sudan.
	   The World Food Program said it would begin delivering food
Friday to the Bahr el-Ghazal province, where more than 700,000
people are facing famine, the U.N. agency's resource director, Tun
Myat, said in Khartoum.
	   Myat said Thursday that the food delivery had been made possible
after the Sudanese government and a rebel group agreed this week on
a three-month cease-fire.
	   The first shipment was to arrive on an Ilyushin-76 aircraft
dispatched from the Sudanese capital Khartoum, Myat said. He said
another three Il-76 aircraft will join the fleet in the coming
days.
	   The WFP estimates that outside Bahr el-Ghazal some 1.9 million
more Sudanese are in urgent need of food. The WFP plans to deliver
15,000 tons of food per month in Sudan over the next four months.
The program will cost dlrs 84 million.
	   Myat said the United Nations intends to deliver food through
three safe passage corridors opened under the cease-fire terms: by
truck from Uganda, on ferries from northern Sudan, and by two
trains each month from the north.
	   At a separate news conference Thursday, Sudan's Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail warned the rebel Sudan People's Liberation
Army not to take advantage of the truce, which began Wednesday.
	   ``We will observe the cease-fire and will not use it to attack
the other side,'' Ismail said.
	   ``But if it is used as a trick to attack us, we will defend
ourselves,'' he told the news conference, which was attended by
visiting British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett.
	   Fatchett had met with both sides to help secure the cease-fire.
	   The truce ``should also give renewed confidence to the Sudanese
government and the SPLA to engage in a broader political
discussion,'' Fatchett said.
	   Fighting between the SPLA and government troops has prevented
people from planting crops and has made delivery of relief food
difficult. The area is also suffering from drought.
	   The rebels have been fighting since 1983 for autonomy for the
predominantly African, Christian and animist south, which has
historically been dominated by the Muslim and Arab north. An
estimated 1.5 million people have died in the fighting and
resulting famines.

 &UR; Government says Japan's economy showing few signs of recovery

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's economy shows few signs of recovery amid
weak consumer spending, low corporate investment and sluggish
exports, the Economic Planning Agency said in its monthly report
issued Friday.
	   For a sixth consecutive month, Japan's chief economic agency
said the economy remains stuck in a period of stagnation, noting
declining housing investment, capital spending, imports and
exports.
	   Agency officials said the economic situation could improve as
soon as next month from the impact of supplemental government
spending, but private economists remain wary.
	   ``There is absolutely no good news,'' Jesper Koll, JP Morgan
Securities Asia Ltd. research head, said of the EPA report.

U.N. pulls human rights mission out of Rwanda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs. &QL; 
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The United Nations plans to terminate its
human rights mission in Rwanda because it has failed to reach an
agreement with the Rwandan government over how to proceed.
	   The United Nations considers the monitoring of human rights
abuses to be a key part of the mandate of a mission established in
November 1994, four months after half a million people were killed
in a government-orchestrated genocide.
	   But after four days of talks, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Human Rights and Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana said in
separate statements that in the absence of an agreement, the
mission will be terminated at the end of the month.
	   The government was unhappy with the way the mission was
concentrating on alleged reprisal killings by the army, rather than
focussing on attacks by Hutu rebels. And it said the mission was
not giving officials enough time to respond to its reports.
	   The government also questioned the value of the monitoring
process after the United Nations pulled its human rights observers
out of the western third of Rwanda following the deaths of five
monitors in a 1997 rebel ambush near the southwestern border town
of Cyangugu. Most of the rebel attacks and army counterattacks
occur in the western part of the tiny central African nation.
	   In May, the government suspended the U.N. mission, which had a
staff of about 50, and insisted its mandate should be renegotiated
to focus on efforts to educate people about human rights and help
set up national rights organizations.
	   The United Nations, however, insisted that monitoring be part of
the operation.
	   The government has been sensitive to criticism of its human
rights record after the extremist Hutu government-organized
slaughter of more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically
moderate Hutus.
	   The present government took power in July 1994 after the victory
of Tutsi-led rebels who stopped the 90-day killing spree.
	   Many of the former Hutu government soldiers and militiamen
responsible for carrying out the genocide were among the 1 million
Hutu refugees fled into exile. They were also among the refugees
who returned to Rwanda in November 1996.
	   Since then, thousands of people _ both Hutus and Tutsis _ have
died in rebel attacks on schools, bars, buses and homes.
	   The government and the army say those soldiers suspected of
killing Hutu civilians are prosecuted. Army officials say it is
often impossible to distinguish between the rebels and ordinary
Hutu civilians, who provide the insurgents with shelter, food and
money.

Hundreds prepare to leave East Timor on tense anniversary

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Fearing fresh violence and carrying their
most prized possessions, hundreds of fearful residents on Friday
boarded a boat scheduled to leave conflict-ridden East Timor.
	   In the streets of the territory's tense capital, hundreds of
soldiers armed with sticks and rifles patrolled on the 22nd
anniversary of Indonesia's annexation of the former Portuguese
colony.
	   Thousands of people have left East Timor in recent days amid
worries that pro-independence activists might demonstrate on the
anniversary, touching off clashes with security forces. Since last
month, soldiers have killed two protesters during rallies.
	   The turmoil comes during a visit to Indonesia by U.N. envoy
Jamsheed Marker, who is trying to broker a solution to the bitter
impasse in East Timor.
	   The resignation in May of authoritarian President Suharto and
ensuing democratic change in Indonesia have given new impetus to
efforts to negotiate an accord. Still, new President B.J. Habibie
rules out independence in the territory, the fervent hope of many
East Timorese.
	   Later Friday, Marker planned to meet East Timor's jailed
separatist guerrilla leader, Xanana Gusmao, who is serving a
20-year sentence in a Jakarta prison. The U.N. official was
expected to meet Habibie this weekend.
	   At the Dili port, many people carted radios, televisions,
luggage and other possessions as they boarded a boat bound for Java
island, the most populated of Indonesia's 17,000 islands and home
to the capital, Jakarta.
	   Some people shepherded pigs and ducks.
	   The boat was scheduled to leave later Friday. Officials said all
1,200 tickets had been sold.
	   The travelers were mostly immigrants from neighboring islands
who complained of intimidation and harassment by indigenous East
Timorese.
	   Ngadiyanto, a 37-year-old taxi driver who waited in line with
his wife and child, said thugs had demanded his watch and money
several times and he was robbed last week.
	   ``After five years living in Dili, I've been feeling insecure
for the past two months,'' he said.
	   In recent days, there have also been scattered incidents of
stone-throwing at cars in Dili.
	   Most shops in the seaside capital were shut Friday as the
Indonesian-appointed governor, Abilio Soares, pressed ahead with a
ceremony marking Indonesia's takeover of East Timor.
	   Hundreds of police, soldiers and civil servants in blue and
brown uniforms stood in rows outside the Portuguese colonial-era
governor's office as a military brass band played. A red and white
Indonesian flag was draped above the entrance to the pillared
building.
	   ``I urge all the parties to avoid the anarchist actions that
have been occurring recently and resulted in some migrant settlers
leaving East Timor,'' Soares said in a speech.
	   There were no reports of violence or anti-Indonesian protests.
Activists who want a vote on independence have said they would stay
off the streets in protest against the governor's celebrations.

Talks go down to wire; U.S. mounts aggressive campaign

	   ROME (AP) _ Delegates from 160 countries faced a Friday deadline
to hammer out a U.N. treaty creating the world's first standing war
crimes court as the United States mounted an aggressive campaign to
limit its reach.
	   The U.N. conference hopes to establish a court where individuals
could be prosecuted for the most heinous offenses: genocide, war
crimes and crimes against humanity.
	   The conference is split into two camps: delegates who want the
strongest, most independent court possible, and delegates _
including those from the United States _ who want to curb its
scope.
	   The first camp includes most of America's closest allies,
western democracies like Canada and Britain. The second includes an
array of nations not known for having sterling records on human
rights.
	   As time winds down, the United States was fighting hard for a
loophole that would, in effect, let it veto the prosecution of
American soldiers abroad.
	   With U.S. troops deployed in hot spots around the world, the
Pentagon fears its people would become the targets of politically
motivated charges. The problem with the loophole, however, is that
virtually any war criminal might use it to avoid prosecution.
	   expenses.
	   A deal also was reached on adding ``forced pregnancy'' to the
list of war crimes, according to Bosnia's U.N. ambassador, Muhamed
Sacirbey.
	   The Vatican and Arab countries _ all abortion opponents _ had
opposed such a provision for fear that endorsing the idea that
forcing a woman to carry out a pregnancy is a crime is an implicit
endorsement of her right to end that pregnancy.

Novotna wins, exhibition loses another player _ Mirjana Lucic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Inserts 5 grafs with Novotna, de Swardt quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By TOM CANAVAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAHWAH, New Jersey (AP) _ The A and P Tennis Classic is becoming
more well known for players not showing up than the presence of
Wimbledon champion Jana Novotna and Steffi Graf.
	   A day after Russian teen-age sensation Anna Kournikova withdrew
after aggravating a thumb injury, Croatian teen-ager Mirjana Lucic
backed out because of a fever related to a bout with chicken pox,
event director John Korff said late Thursday.
	   Lucic, ranked No. 44 in the world, developed the chicken pox
before Wimbledon, where she lost in the first round to Serena
Williams.
	   Lucic, who has a three-year contract to play in this event, was
to play Graf on Friday night in a quarterfinal match.
	   Korff said that Graf will now play the loser of the USTA
Challenger match being held on Friday morning between top-seeded
Fang Li of China and No. 2 Amy Frazier of Rochester Hills, Mich.
	   The winner of the challenger match will advance to the
semifinals Saturday and will play the winner of the Graf match.
	   The other semifinal will feature Novotna and Amanda Coetzer of
South Africa.
	   Novotna, who won her first Grand Slam event by winning Wimbledon
less than two weeks ago, advanced to the semifinals on Thursday
night by beating South Africa's Mariaan de Swardt, Kournikova's
replacement, 6-3, 6-4. Coetzer beat Lisa Raymond in a quarterfinal
on Wednesday.
	   ``You can't get frustrated, they're injured,'' Korff said of the
withdrawals. ``This happens in tennis all the time.''
	   Kournikova, who sprained ligaments in her right thumb at
Eastbourne the week before Wimbledon, showed up on Thursday for an
interview and an on-court appearance for the crowd before the
Novotna match.
	   Korff said Kournikova was paid expenses and a little money for
the trip from Detroit, but she did not get her six-figure
appearance fee.
	   ``Like I said, I wanted to come here for the fans,'' said
Kournikova, who wore tight denim pants and a halter top. ``I'm
really disappointed I can't play but I had to do something.''
	   Novotna was disappointed Kournikova was hurt.
	   ``I'm sure it would have been a great match,'' Novotna said.
``But it's unfortunate she is still hurt. I hope she gets better
soon.''
	   Novotna said she hoped Kournikova would be ready for the U.S.
Open, which begins Aug. 31.
	   Novotna needed only 65 minutes to beat de Swardt. She had the
only two service breaks in the first set and she added three more
in the second after falling behind 0-2.
	   De Swardt, who was watching television on her couch in Hilton
Head, S.C., when she was asked to play here, said she jumped at the
chance to play the Wimbledon champion.
	   ``If you want to be a player like that, you have to jump on them
from the beginning,'' de Swardt said. ``I wasn't able to do that.''
	   Graf also is fighting an infection, Korff said, but she is
expected to play. The German is currently ranked No. 57 after being
sidelined with a knee injury.
	   Graf lost in the third round at Wimbledon to Natasha Zvereva.
She isn't predicting when her game will be back.
	   ``I'm taking it one tournament after the other,'' Graf said.
``That's one of the other things I learned, to wait and see and
play. If I'll be able to play all these tournaments and, hopefully,
feel more secure and feel more confident about my game, we'll see
what happens. But, it's, for me, a little far away right now.''

Two Senior politicians announce candidacies to become premier
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TOK101-106 of July 16
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of senior Japanese politicians announced
their candidacies Friday to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, as the race intensified to choose the leader of the
world's second-largest economy.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, a 61-year-old party veteran with
extensive Cabinet experience, is seen as the favorite of ruling
Liberal Democratic Party elders.
	   But a growing number of reformist lawmakers are throwing their
support behind former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama to
succeed Hashimoto, who announced his resignation earlier this week
after his party's stunning defeat in upper house elections.
	   Before announcing his bid, Obuchi had spent days building up
support in the traditional manner of holding closed door meetings
with LDP powerbrokers.
	   ``I have made up my mind,'' Obuchi told reporters outside his
residence Friday morning. ``I will fight with all my strength.''
	   The party will vote July 24 to choose its next leader and thus,
because of the LDP's control of Parliament's lower house, prime
minister.
	   But many junior party members are protesting what they call
Obuchi's lack of ideas, saying the country needs strong leadership
to lift the stagnant economy.
	   They are also criticizing the way Obuchi has gone about securing
party support. Choosing the party's leader through backroom deals
is exactly the sort of politics that voters were rejecting when
they handed the LDP its defeat at the polls on Sunday, they say.
	   Many expressed support for Kajiyama, a longtime critic of
Hashimoto's economic policies and a champion of big tax cuts.
	   Sunday's defeat in upper house elections was widely seen here as
a vote against the way the LDP has managed Japan's economy, which
is in the midst of its severest recession since World War II.
	   At a meeting Thursday of all party lawmakers from both houses of
Japan's bicameral Parliament, junior members called for a more
transparent decision-making process and for candidates to come
forward with a clear vision for the future.
	   While the party had planned to choose its leader by July 21,
pressure from younger lawmakers forced it to postpone the vote by
three days to give candidates time to explain their views on issues
such as the economy.
	   National broadcaster NHK said Kajiyama's bid has caused some LDP
factions to waver in their previous support for the foreign
minister.
	   Former Deputy Prime Minister Yohei Kono, tipped as a possible
contender, also reportedly said he would support Kajiyama's
candidacy.
	   Still, Obuchi's position remained strong because he heads the
LDP's largest faction and has the backing of the party's main power
broker, former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.

Rematch promoted for De La Hoya, Chavez
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ The anticipated Las Vegas rematch between WBC
welterweight champion Oscar De La Hoya and Mexico's Julio Cesar
Chavez was promoted Thursday as a chance for De La Hoya to regain
respect.
	   The fight is set for Sept. 18 as part of a TVKO pay-per-view
card featuring a 12-round heavyweight match between former
undisputed champion Buster Douglas and Lou Savarese.
	   ``This fight here, this boxing match, it's something personal,''
De La Hoya told KCBS-TV on Thursday. ``The first time he (Chavez)
didn't give me the credit that I deserved, saying he was cut, he
was not prepared. But this time, I'm going to show the crowd that
the first time wasn't a fluke.''
	   De La Hoya stopped Chavez, a former champion in three weight
classes, in four rounds in defense of the WBC super lightweight
title June 7, 1996 at Las Vegas. The 35-year-old Chavez said last
month he's still got a lot of fight left.
	   ``September 18 will be the surprise of the year. This time, I'm
going to beat Oscar,'' Chavez said during a June news conference.
	   Promoter Bob Arum is offering Chavez a dlrs 250,000 bonus if he
wins by knockout.
	   ``The first time I prepared myself and was in really good shape,
physically and mentally, and this time around I'm going to be in
better shape,'' De La Hoya said.

Two Senior politicians announce candidacies to become premier

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A pair of senior Japanese politicians announced
their candidacies Friday to replace outgoing Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, as the race intensified to choose the leader of the
world's second-largest economy.
	   Foreign Minister Keizo Obuchi, a 61-year-old party veteran with
extensive Cabinet experience, is seen as the favorite of ruling
Liberal Democratic Party elders.
	   But a growing number of reformist lawmakers are throwing their
support behind former Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama to
succeed Hashimoto, who announced his resignation earlier this week
after his party's stunning defeat in upper house elections.
	   Before announcing his bid, Obuchi had spent days building up
support in the traditional manner of holding closed door meetings
with LDP power brokers.
	   ``I will do everything I can to revive the economy,'' Obuchi
said at a press conference Friday morning to formally announce his
candidacy. ``I will work with all my strength.''
	   The party will vote July 24 to choose its next leader and thus,
because of the LDP's control of Parliament's lower house, prime
minister.
	   But many junior party members are protesting what they call
Obuchi's lack of ideas, saying the country needs strong leadership
to revive the stagnant economy.
	   They also oppose the way Obuchi has gone about securing party
support. They argue that secret deals and backroom politicking were
exactly what voters were rejecting when they handed the LDP its
defeat at the polls on Sunday.
	   Many expressed support for Kajiyama, 72, a longtime critic of
Hashimoto's economic policies and a champion of big tax cuts.
	   ``We must think about how to save Japan from this critical
situation,'' Kajiyama told supporters at a meeting Friday morning
to announce his bid.
	   Sunday's defeat in upper house elections was widely seen here as
a vote against the way the LDP has managed Japan's economy, which
is in the midst of its severest recession since World War II.
	   Japanese media said a third candidate may also enter the race.
Nippon Television reported that a group of LDP lawmakers may back a
bid by Health and Welfare Minister Junichiro Koizumi, an outspoken
56-year-old who is widely seen as one of the party's rising stars.
	   ``Having three candidates would probably increase the people's
interest,'' Koizumi told reporters. But he avoided making a clear
statement about whether he will run.
	   Former Deputy Prime Minister Yohei Kono, tipped as another
possible contender, also reportedly said he would support
Kajiyama's candidacy.
	   At a meeting Thursday of all party lawmakers from both houses of
Japan's bicameral Parliament, junior members called for a more
transparent decision-making process and for candidates to come
forward with a clear vision for the future.
	   While the party had planned to choose its leader by July 21,
pressure from younger lawmakers forced it to postpone the vote by
three days to give candidates time to explain their views on issues
such as the economy.
	   A public debate would likely disadvantage Obuchi, who has made
no statement about what he would do as prime minister besides a
vague pledge to continue Hashimoto's policies.
	   National broadcaster NHK said Kajiyama's bid has caused some LDP
factions to waver in their previous support for the foreign
minister.
	   Still, Obuchi's position remained strong because he heads the
LDP's largest faction and has the backing of the party's main power
broker, former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.

Coach expects tougher match from South Africa
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Australian coach Rod Macqueen said South
Africa will give the Wallabies a tougher match in Saturday's rugby
union test than they faced in last week's win over New Zealand.
	   Macqueen said Friday the Springboks were in a similar situation
to Australia last week with a settled team, no injuries and in
winning form, but Australia has had a disrupted preparation this
week because of several injuries.
	   Winger Ben Tune was named in the squad Friday but will have a
fitness test on his injured knee Saturday at Subiaco Oval. Macqueen
said Tune was a 50-50 chance of being a part of the first rugby
test played in Perth.
	   He was bracketed with Jason Little, who will also have a fitness
test Saturday on the calf strain which kept him out of last week's
match and training all this week.
	   Damian Smith and Mitch Hardy are on standby and Smith will train
with the team on Tune's wing on Friday.
	   As expected, prop Dan Crowley came into the side for the injured
Richard Harry for his first start in a test since 1996.
	   As he did last week before the New Zealand test, Macqueen tried
to palm favoritism off to the visitors.
	   ``If I was a betting man, I'd say they looked pretty good,''
Macqueen said.
	   ``They're in a good position because they're settled but we've
had injuries and so on, but certainly there won't be any excuses if
we happen to lose.''
	   Rain has been forecast for Perth on Saturday which Macqueen said
would favor the Springboks. South Africa won its ninth test in a
row two weeks ago against England in heavy rain in Cape Town.
	   Teams:
	   AUSTRALIA: Matt Burke, Ben Tune/Jason Little/Damian Smith,
Daniel Herbert, Tim Horan, Joe Roff, Stephen Larkham, George
Gregan, Toutai Kefu, David Wilson, Matt Cockbain, John Eales
(captain), Tom Bowman, Andrew Blades, Phil Kearns, Dan Crowley.
Reserves: Chris Whittaker, Nathan Grey, Jason Little/Damian
Smith/Mitch Hardy, Willie Ofahengaue, Owen Finegan, Glen Panoho,
Jeremy Paul.
	   SOUTH AFRICA: Percy Montgomery, Stefan Terblanche, Andre Snyman,
Pieter Muller, Pieter Rossouw, Henry Honiball, Joost Van Der
Westhuizen, Gary Teichmann (captain), Andre Venter, Johan Erasmus,
Mark Andrews, Krynauw Otto, Adrian Garvey, James Dalton, Robert
Kempson. Reserves: Chester Williams, Franco Smith, Werner
Swanepoel, Bobby Skinstad, Ollie Le Roux, Naka Drotske. (djp)

Anti-airport activist Ogawa dies of stomach cancer at 75
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kakichi Ogawa, a Japanese farmer who for three
decades stubbornly opposed government efforts to seize his land to
expand Tokyo's main airport, has died of stomach cancer, a hospital
official said Friday. He was 75.
	   Ogawa led a vocal four-household faction that resisted the
construction of a second runway at the airport at Narita, which is
65 kilometers (40 miles) northeast of Tokyo.
	   Ogawa died at a hospital near the airport he spent so long
resisting.
	   Ogawa's battle began in 1966, when the government announced it
would construct a new international airport in what was then a
sleepy rural town.
	   The farmers' protests turned violent when officials tried to
seize their land. Battles with riot police peaked in the 1970s,
when the local demonstrators were joined by leftist radicals, who
insisted that the government secretly wanted to use the facility
for military purposes.
	   The airport opened in 1978, with only one of three planned
runways. Ogawa continued to resist government plans to expropriate
his land to build a second runway.
	   In 1995, Ogawa dropped his protests when then Prime Minister
Tomiichi Murayama apologized for the way the government had tried
to force through construction of the airport without consulting
local farmers.
	   Following the prime minister's apology, Ogawa agreed to sell his
3.2-hectare (7.9-acre) lot located in the path of the planned 2.5
kilometer (1.5 mile) second runway.
	   Two other farmers are still blocking completion of the badly
needed new runway, according to the airport authorities.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's mother said she mingled among
mourners after her daughter's death, drawing strength from their
grief.
	   Diana's mother, Frances Shand Kydd, said in a television
interview aired on Fox on Thursday night in the United States that
she spent the three nights before Diana's funeral among mourners
outside her daughter's Kensington Palace home.
	   ``It was unbelievable, there aren't words to describe it,'' she
said in her first interview since her daughter's death in a Paris
car crash Aug. 31.
	   Tens of thousands of people flocked to Kensington Gardens to lay
flowers and mementos at the gates of the palace after Diana's
death.
	   ``With literally thousands of people comforting, sharing, we
were sharing a very deep hurt,'' she said. ``But I think far too
little has been said about what people all over the world gave to
her. They nourished her, they made her smile, they gave her
strength.''
	   Earlier, The Mirror tabloid published a transcript of the
interview that differed substantially from the program.
	   A spokesman for Fox declined to comment on the discrepancy.
Officials at The Mirror could not immediately be reached for
comment.
	   Mrs. Shand Kydd said she was frustrated by her inability to
shield her daughter from the frustrations that being famous brought
to her.
	   ``I wanted privacy for her, very often, when she wasn't
working,'' she said. ``But it wasn't to be.''

Malaysian Airlines steward sentenced in Singapore for biting off

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A flight steward for Malaysia Airlines was
sentenced for biting off another steward's left ear after losing at
arm wrestling, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   James Jimbat, 30, was sentenced to a year in jail on Thursday
after pleading guilty to causing ``grievous hurt'' to Mohamad
Fadzil, 22.
	   Both men arrived in Singapore last March on a special pass
issued to flight stewards. Jimbat and another colleague went to
Fadzil's hotel room for some arm wrestling.
	   After losing several times, Jimbat challenged Fadzil to a fight.
Angered by Fadzil's refusal to fight, he bit off his ear, the
newspaper said.
	   Fadzil had to undergo reconstructive surgery to have his ear
reattached.

Hundreds leave East Timor on tense anniversary

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with ship leaving East Timor, U.N. envoy meeting rebel
leader in Jakarta

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ Fearing fresh violence and carrying their
most prized possessions, hundreds of residents crowded onto a ship
Friday and fled conflict-ridden East Timor.
	   In the streets of the territory's tense capital, hundreds of
soldiers armed with sticks and rifles patrolled on the 22nd
anniversary of Indonesia's annexation of the former Portuguese
colony.
	   Thousands of people have left East Timor in recent days amid
worries that pro-independence activists might demonstrate on the
anniversary, touching off clashes with security forces. Since last
month, soldiers have killed two protesters during rallies.
	   The turmoil comes during a visit to Indonesia by U.N. envoy
Jamsheed Marker, who is trying to broker a solution to the bitter
impasse in East Timor.
	   The resignation in May of authoritarian President Suharto and
ensuing democratic change in Indonesia have given new impetus to
efforts to negotiate an accord. Still, new President B.J. Habibie
rules out independence in the territory, the fervent hope of many
East Timorese.
	   On Friday, Marker met East Timor's jailed separatist guerrilla
leader, Xanana Gusmao, who is serving a 20-year sentence in a
Jakarta prison. The U.N. official was expected to meet Habibie this
weekend, but he did not say whether he would visit East Timor.
	   Indonesian officials as well as Bishop Carlos Belo, East Timor's
Nobel peace laureate, have urged him to stay away for fear his
visit could touch off violence.
	   At the Dili port, many people carted radios, televisions,
luggage and other possessions onto a boat bound for Bali island.
Many planned to then travel to Java, the most populated of
Indonesia's 17,000 islands and site of the capital, Jakarta.
	   A few people shepherded pigs and ducks. Some waved and cheered
as the boat left port. Officials said all 1,200 tickets had been
sold.
	   The travelers were mostly immigrants from neighboring islands
who complained of intimidation and harassment by indigenous East
Timorese.
	   Ngadiyanto, a 37-year-old taxi driver who waited in line with
his wife and child, said thugs had demanded his watch and money
several times and he was robbed last week.
	   ``After five years living in Dili, I've been feeling insecure
for the past two months,'' he said.
	   In recent days, there have also been scattered incidents of
stone-throwing at cars in Dili.
	   Most shops in the seaside capital were shut Friday as the
Indonesian-appointed governor, Abilio Soares, pressed ahead with a
ceremony marking Indonesia's takeover of East Timor.
	   Hundreds of police, soldiers and civil servants in blue and
brown uniforms stood in rows outside the Portuguese colonial-era
governor's office as a military brass band played. A red and white
Indonesian flag was draped above the entrance to the pillared
building.
	   ``I urge all the parties to avoid the anarchist actions that
have been occurring recently and resulted in some migrant settlers
leaving East Timor,'' Soares said in a speech.
	   There were no reports of violence or anti-Indonesian protests.
Activists who want a vote on independence have said they would stay
off the streets in protest against the governor's celebrations.
