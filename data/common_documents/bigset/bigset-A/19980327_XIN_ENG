<HEADLINE> Germany, France Help Increase Russia's Role in Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Germany and France vowed to help
Russia play a bigger role in European affairs as leaders of the
three countries concluded their first informal meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to do everything to prevent the appearance of the
impression that someone is trying to isolate Russia after the Cold
War," said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Kohl added the summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
French President Jacques Chirac was not directed against the
U.S. or any other European country.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac said that France wanted to increase Russia's
role in Europe. "We realize the importance of confiding, close
relations between the EU and Russia, which are close poles of the
multipolar world of tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The three leaders, who will meet again in France in May 1999,
also discussed a joint project to develop a European transport
plane for the 21st century based on the Russian-Ukrainian An-70
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
They also plan to create a special rescue service to tackle
natural and industrial disasters in the three countries.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Says Development Aid to Poor Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report, entitled "Global Development Finance 1998",
predicts that a combination of factors, including wariness of
investors and uncertain prospects for recovery in East Asia, is
likely to reduce net long-term private flows to developing
countries in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank points out, however, that if the crisis
bottoms out, this decline would be tempered by the continued
robust health of the global economy, investors returning to
markets in countries with strong economic fundamentals, and
changes in the composition of capital flows.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's report examines the causes and evolution of the
East Asian financial crisis which began with sharp currency
depreciations in Thailand in July.
</P>
<P>
It also analyzes how the combination of financial crisis and
falling stock market prices and restricted access to international
capital markets quickly spread throughout the region, and affected
other regions such as Latin America and Eastern Europe.

<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Out-going British High Commissioner
to Zimbabwe, Martin Williams Thursday said Britain and Zimbabwe must
find amicable ways to resolve differences over the land redistribution
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Williams was speaking at a farewell luncheon hosted for him in
Harare, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said although the two countries have had differences in the
land redistribution issue, these must be settled amicably in the
interests of both countries.
</P>
<P>
''My government is prepared to put some money to help the
Zimbabwean government in their current programs, for instance in the
land redistribution exercise and we wish if that standstill is solved
amicably,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Zimbabwean government, which has already designated
1,500 farms for compulsory acquisition, would only compensate
affected farmers for improvements on their properties and not for the
value of the soil.
</P>
<P>
The British government criticized the policy of the Zimbabwean
government and sticked to the policy of willing-sale and willing-buy.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Be Affected by New European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- European bankers have
predicted that South Africa's trade and financial transactions
with Europe are likely to be affected when the Euro, a single
currency is introduced in the continent early next year.
</P>
<P>
Local daily, Sowetan quoted Tom Boardman, managing director of
Europe-based BOE Investment Bank, as reporing Thursday that the
launch of the Euro will be a major world event. He urged South
African businesses to prepare themselves ahead of the event.
</P>
<P>
The Euro is expected to be introduced in January when 11
European currencies amalgamate.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the Euro has been largely ignored in
South Africa as some nebulous future events... People are now
realizing that it is less than a year away and they had better
find out how it will affect them," Boardman said.
</P>
<P>
Pat McArdle, a senior official of Ulster Bank Group said there
were obvious practical implications for South African financial
institutions business in the sphere of international trade.
</P>
<P>
Since European cross-border price differences will become
obvious, a single currency will make it easier for South African
trade to span a wide area of Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The major opportunity for South African companies will be to
make it easier to resource imports because greater price
transparency will boost competition," said McArdle.
</P>
<P>
He said since Britain and Germany have traditionally been
South Africa's two largest trading partners, local companies will
now find that they can source their imports at more favorable
prices in one of other 10 Euro-denomination countries.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission Wednesday recommended 11 European
Union countries for single currency, the Euro. They are Germany,
France, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Belgium, Finland, Portugal,
Austria, Luxembourg and Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
McArdle suggested that the Euro is likely to become
increasingly pervasive and may challenge the United States dollar
for world hegemony in the long term.

<HEADLINE> S. African Muslims Oppose Clinton's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A South African Muslim
leader said on Thursday that Muslims in the country had a duty to
oppose the state visit of U.S.President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Abdulatief Abrahams, Chairman of Muslims Against Global
Oppression (MAGO) said in Cape Town that MAGO was established for
the sole purpose of opposing any form of oppression perpetrated
against "believing people".
</P>
<P>
"We want to make all Muslims aware of the global onslaught
against Islam by the Zionist and their allies in the west,
especially America (United States)," Abrahams said.
</P>
<P>
Abrahams said that the bloodshedding in Bosnia, Iraq, Somalia
and other countries was the fault of U.S. aid provided to
oppressors there.
</P>
<P>
He said even if massive foreign loans or investments
followed Clinton's South African visit, the money would go "to
the fat cats in parliament, and the man in the street won't see a
cent."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, MAGO members staged a placard demonstration at the
Cape Town airport before Clinton's arrival.
</P>
<P>
Some of the placards read: "U.S.A. is the enemy of the
oppressed of the world", "Clinton, we don't want you here, you
murdering scum", "America fears Islam. One bullet one Bill Clinton
and death to Bill Clinton".
</P>
<P>
Clinton and his 1,000-strong entourage arrived in Cape Town on
Thursday morning to start a four-day state visit in South Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) reported that only three percent of Nigerians
below 25 years old are engaged in agriculture in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a newly-issued publication titled "National Agricultural
Sample Census 1993/94", FOS said that the number of farmers aged
between 25 and 44 stands at 46 percent, while those aged between
45 and 59 account for 33 percent of the farming population.
</P>
<P>
FOS said earlier that an average of 61 percent of households
in the country are engaged in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has a population of around 100 million.
</P>
<P>
As for the farmers' marital status, only four percent of them
are not married, whereas 84 percent are married and 12 percent
are widowed, divorced or separated, it said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that 59 percent of the farmers in Nigeria
have primary education, as against 28 percent with secondary
education and nine percent with post secondary education. The
number of those who never went to school stands at four percent.

and U.S. President Bill Clinton have agreed that the existing
"good relations" between Kenya and the U.S. should be further
strengthened and deepened, the Kenya News Agency (KNA) reported

<HEADLINE> UK Female Prison Population at Highest Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- There is a significant increase in
the female population of prisons in England and Wales, with the
total number now standing at 3,053, the highest level since 1905,
according to figures published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper said that many prison officials share
the view that some female prisoners should not be in prison as it
is quite clear that a number of women in prison are there as a
direct result of poverty and abuse.
</P>
<P>
David Roddan, general secretary of the Prison Governors'
Association, was quoted as saying that "prison governors have been
aware for some years that imprisonment is being over-used".
</P>
<P>
He added that "This impacts particularly on women, because the
growth in the female prison population has been double that of the
male population over the past three years, and there has been no
corresponding increase in the number of the offenses being
committed by women".
</P>
<P>
It was reported that according to last year's report from the
Chief Inspector of Prisons, 70 percent of female prisoners posed
no security risk and should not be held in closed prisons.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the prison service called on the government to
examine the possibility of more community based outlets rather
than keeping female prisoners all in prison.
</P>
<P>
A Home Office spokesman was quoted as saying that the
government was trying to improve the public's perception of
community, non-custodial sentences and was carrying out trials on
electronic tagging and the use of curfews.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Faces Shortage of Education Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Education Minister
Gabriel Machinga said on Thursday that one of the most serious
problems facing the country's education is critical
shortage of teaching materials.
</P>
<P>
Machinga said this at a ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary
of the Herbert Chitepo Trust and the official opening of the
trust's new office in Harare, reported the Zimbabwe News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it is impossible to improve the quality
of education when books are not available to both teachers and
students.
</P>
<P>
"The practice of sharing textbooks not only inconveniences the
pupils and the teachers, but also leads to the early destruction
of the few books available," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Without books it is impossible to stimulate reading and
writing among the new literates."
</P>
<P>
Machinga noted that the devalued purchasing power of the
Zimbabwean Dollar and the devastating effects of inflation in the
economy has greatly weakened the ability of parents to purchase
books for their children.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Herbert Chitepo Trust, launched in 1993 by
President Robert Mugabe,is an important vehicle in commemorating
and recognizing the outstanding work and achievements of the late
nationalist leader Herbert Chitepo in the fields of law and
politics.
</P>
<P>
The minister described late Chitepo as an outstanding
Zimbabwean scholar, a man of letters, a very committed educator
and an advocate for an independent, confident and resourceful
Africa.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Corporate Profits Drop Sharply in 4th Quarter 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. corporation profits
recorded the sharpest decline in nearly four years during the
fourth quarter of 1997 despite a robust economic growth as a
whole, the Commerce Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After-tax corporate profits slipped 2.3 percent in the fourth
quarter, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 483.7 billion
U.S. dollars, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The report, also includes a revision of previous estimates of
the gross domestic product, contained the department's first look
at profits in the fourth quarter. The drop was the worst since the
first quarter of 1994 and also the first since the July-October
period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the revised figure, the U.S. quarterly GDP grew at
a brisk 3.7 percent annual pace. Though not quite as strong as the
3.9 percent estimated a month ago, that still is considered
robust.
</P>
<P>
However, for the year as a whole, the increase in after-tax
corporate profits, up 7.3 percent to 480.3 billion dollars,
outpaced the 3.8 percent increase in the economy's total output of
goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The fourth quarter decline may extend the trends to this year.
Confronted with shortages of qualified workers, a result of the
lowest unemployment rate in 24 years, many employers have been
forced to raise wages. But, on the other hand, in many industries,
they haven't been able to raise the prices of their products in
fear of losing competition to much less expensive Asian
commodities.

<HEADLINE> More UK Women Take to Smoking, Drinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The proportion of UK women who smoke
and drink heavily has started to rise recently after more than 20
years of steady decline as traditionally male patterns of life are
increasingly adopted by women, according to official figures
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 General Household Survey, published Thursday by the
Office for National Statistics, revealed that the proportion of
women smoking rose between 1994 and 1996 from 26 to 28 percent,
about to overtake the 29 percent of men who smoke.
</P>
<P>
The trend is most pronounced among young women, as 34 percent of
women aged 25-34 were smokers in 1996 compared with 30 percent two
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
The annual snapshot of contemporary British life also found that
women who drink heavily, particularly young professional women, are
also on the increase and are rapidly catching up with the drinking
levels of their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that the number of women exceeding the
recommended drinking level has grown from 10 to 14 percent, but the
number for men has remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
This is again particularly pronounced among young women, as one
in four women aged 18-24 drank more than recommended in 1996
compared with one in seven in 1994.

South Africa's parliament in Cape Town on Thursday afternoon to
protest the visit of United States President Bill Clinton, who was to
address a joint sitting of two parliamentary houses in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, chanting slogans like "Clinton is a baby-killer",
were prevented from reaching the gates of parliament by a wire mesh
barrier and scores of uniformed riot police, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
At one stage it seemed that a scuffle was imminent, but they backed
off in the face of the strong police presence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a group, calling themselves "Muslims Against Global

parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Muslim group held a demonstration outside
the Cape Town Airport to "send a strong message" of disapproval to the
U.S. president, who arrived at the airport in the morning for a
state visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the group, Muslim leader Abdulatief Abrahams, said
Muslims in South Africa had a duty to oppose Clinton's visit

</P>
<P>
The chairman of the talks, former U.S. senator George Mitchell,
decided on Wednesday to set April 9 as the deadline for a deal to
end the decades-long conflict in Northern Ireland. He also said
discussions would soon go into permanent session until a deal was
struck.
</P>
<P>
The feuding parties in the talks welcomed the decision, giving
new hope for a political settlement to the conflict in Britain's
divided province.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very significant development. It presents all
parties with the opportunity to reach an historic agreement," said
John Hume, leader of the Roman Catholic nationalist Social
Democratic and Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
David Kerr, spokesman for the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the
largest pro-British party in the province, said the UUP "will do
everything we can within reason to expedite an agreement from
these talks."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political arm of Irish Republican Army
guerrillas who oppose rule from Britain, saw it as an opportunity
to end centuries of conflict.
</P>
<P>
"Sinn Fein believes an agreement is possible within the
timeframe envisaged provided that all parties engage in good
faith," spokeswoman Bairbre de Brun said.
</P>
<P>
The British and Irish governments plan to hold referendums in
both Northern Ireland and the Irish republic in late May to decide
the fate of Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Warns Russia of Arms Sales to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen on Thursday warned against any Russian arms sale to
Yugoslavia although Moscow has denied any such a sale as reported
in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions during a photo opportunity with
Finland Defense Minister Anneli Taina at Pentagon, Cohen said any
sale of Russian military weapons to Yugoslavia would violate the
Dayton peace agreement and threaten peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"This would be contrary to agreements, contrary to Dayton, and
we hope that the reports are not accurate... further sales and
transfers of weapons to the region would be counter-productive,"
Cohen told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that we can encourage both parties to act
responsibly and we do not see a transfer of weapons being in the
interest of promoting peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, The New York Times reported that Russia had
agreed in principle to sell tanks, warplanes and other arms to
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign Ministry denied
the report on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Death Sentence on Nurse Reaffirmed in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Thursday ruled
to keep in place a death sentence on a young nurse charged with
killing a patient and attempting to kill 29 others by injecting
lethal doses into them, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Alexandria Criminal Court reaffirmed the sentence on Aida
Nourreddine, which was ordered on March 11, after the approval of
the Mufti, Egypt's chief Muslim official, during the day.
</P>
<P>
Nourreddine, 25, working in the Alexandria University Hospital,
was arrested last August after 33 patients died due to respiratory
failure shortly after successful surgeries.
</P>
<P>
She was suspected of injecting into the patients a respiratory
muscle relaxant which choked them to death.
</P>
<P>
But she was charged with killing one patient as autopsy could
be conducted only on one of the victims.
</P>
<P>
But, meanwhile, she was also accused of attempting to murder 29
others who survived.
</P>
<P>
The nurse, however, pleaded innocent and accused doctors of
negligence and prescribing wrong medication for the patients.
</P>
<P>
Nourreddine's supporters are trying to make an appeal at the
Cessation Court, which is to make the final jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
During the investigation of her case, the nurse fell from the
third floor of the Prosecution Building of Alexandria, broke
several bones, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But it is not known whether she jumped out herself or was
pushed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the police found that the dossiers of the victims
have disappeared, according to the Al-Ahram, one of Egypt's
national newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials claimed that they have been disposed of, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to the standard practice, the files should be kept
for five years, the Egyptian Gazette said.

<HEADLINE> Disarmament Conference to Establish Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament (CD)
adopted a compromise proposal by consensus here Thursday to
establish an ad hoc committee on negative security assurances and
appoint special coordinators for other issues on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Consultations on the composition of the ad hoc committee and
the special coordinators will be held between now and the
resumption of the second part of the 1998 session on May 11. The
first part opened on January 19 and will end on March 27.
</P>
<P>
However, the proposal did not enjoy complete support from the
CD members. Canada and South Africa said they did not back the
decision, but indicated they would not oppose it so as not to
block consensus.
</P>
<P>
Other countries backed the decision with reservations. The
representative of China called the decision "not strictly
satisfactory", adding that China had joined the consensus to show
as much as possible a flexible and constructive spirit.
</P>
<P>
Japan considered the decision not entirely satisfactory.
Nonetheless, its representative said that he was aware of the
necessity to begin work at the conference as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The representatives of India, Pakistan and Syria said the
proposal did not reflect their national positions, especially
regarding the priority they felt should be given to nuclear
disarmament. The representative of Egypt also stressed that
nuclear disarmament should receive priority attention, but said
the decision at least allowed the conference to begin concrete
work.
</P>
<P>
As for agenda item 1 entitled "Cessation of the nuclear arms
race and nuclear disarmament", the conference decided that it
would be the subject of further consultations under the authority
of the CD president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Willing to Work With S. Africa: Says Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Thursday that his country is willing to work with South
Africa through a "genuine partnership."
</P>
<P>
"As a new South Africa emerges, we seek a genuine partnership
based on mutual respect and mutual reward," Clinton told a joint
sitting of South African parliament in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"Simply put, America wants a strong South Africa, America
needs a strong South Africa. And we are determined to work with
you as you build a strong South Africa."
</P>
<P>
In the short speech broadcast live on South African national
television, Clinton also pledged to strengthen cooperation with
South Africa in dealing with international issues, such as the
fight against international crimes and the building of a
nuclear-free Africa.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the United States would shift its Africa
policy from aid to trade.
</P>
<P>
Questions like "What can we do for Africa, or whatever can we
do about Africa?" were wrong, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The right question should be: What can we do with Africa?"
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has worked out a U.S.-Africa Growth and
Opportunity Bill, which seeks to open African markets, replace
aid with trade, and grant better U.S. market access for African
exports.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa has expressed reservations about the
legislation, which has been approved by the U.S. House of
Representatives and now is going to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said Clinton's
formula -- trade, not aid -- was wrong. Africa, including South
Africa, needs both.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary to recognize that the U.S. and poor
African countries like Burkina Faso were not partners of equal
weight which could enter into an equal bargaining posture.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of South African Parliament's Trade and Industry
Committee, Rob Davies, said on Wednesday that the U.S. bill was a
rather "one-way determination and it is just straight direct
conditionalities."
</P>
<P>
To be eligible, African countries would have to meet a long
list of conditions, based on which the U.S. president would
decide whether a country did not engage in gross human rights
violations and was making progress towards establishing a
market-based economy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in his speech that his country will cooperate
with Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Africa needs the world, but the world needs Africa, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo said Thursday in Cape Town that his
government will not bring up the African crisis response
initiative with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Nzo told reporters that such an initiative can only be
discussed within the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
He said that the South African government will focus its
discussions on developments in Africa and the role which the
United States government can play.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived in Cape Town on Thursday morning for a
four-day state visit, is expected to hold official talks with
South African President Nelson Mandela on Friday while
ministerial delegations will be working out bilateral agreements
on trade and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president was accompanied by his secretaries for
labour, transportation and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The OAU was set up in 1963 to fight apartheid and colonialism
in the continent and to unite the African people.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reiterates Position on Deployment of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Thursday reiterated that
it can cancel the missile deal with Russia if President Glafcos
Clerides' proposal for demilitarization of the island is accepted
by the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Chirstos Stylianides made the remark at
his daily press briefing while commenting on recent statements by
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos that Greece will support
Cyprus in the event of a Turkish offensive against the island or
its defensive missile system expected to be deployed later this
year.
</P>
<P>
"The government is ready to look into the possibility of
suspending or canceling the deployment of the Russian missiles if
significant steps are made leading to the demilitarization of
Cyprus within a specified timetable," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government ordered Russian-made surface-to-air
missiles system in January 1997. The deal was criticized by the
U.S. and some European Union (EU) member states, and Turkey has
threatened to strike the missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides welcomed Pangalos' expression of support, saying
that his statement is part of the coordination between Greece and
Cyprus in defense and strategic matters, as these are defined in a
joint defense pact agreed between the two governments in November
1993.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the latest development on Cyprus problem,
Stylianides said the Cypriot government believes that further
pressure should be exerted to bow Turkish intransigence and "we
are trying to promote these views with the help of the Greek
government."
</P>
<P>
The government, he pointed out, wishes to see more effective
pressure by the international community, which would lead to a
comprehensive settlement, and hopes this can be achieved.
</P>
<P>
The international peace efforts for a solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem have gone into deadlock since the
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash refused to attend further
peace negotiations unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus
is internationally recognized.
</P>
<P>
Denktash also insisted that the negotiations can be only
resumed on the basis of "state-to-state" talks, a precondition
rejected by the internationally recognized Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
This eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkish troops invaded and took over the northern third of
the island following a short-lived pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Denktash declared unilaterally a breakaway "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" in 1983, which was only recognized by Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Voices Opposition to EU Farm Reform Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government voiced strong
opposition early Thursday to the proposed European Union (EU)
agriculture reform plans, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Irish Agriculture Minister Joe Walsh Thursday told visiting EU
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler that EU proposals to
reform the 15-nation bloc's agriculture policy were simply
unacceptable to his country.
</P>
<P>
Walsh said, "No government, no minister for agriculture could
accept these proposals in their present form and still claim to
represent the best interests of the Irish people."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the EU plans, which are designed to cut
Ireland's EU agriculture subsidies, were "seriously
disadvantageous to Irish agriculture and, by extension, to the
Irish economy".
</P>
<P>
The Dublin government is expected to put forward its argument
to the EU Commission and the EU Agenda 2000 council during the
negotiation period for at least a year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fischler insisted that planned EU agriculture
reforms were necessary and realistic, but indicated that there was
still room for negotiation by saying the draft proposals were "not
carved in stone".
</P>
<P>
"There is room for manoeuvre here -- if Ireland sets out its
objections we can talk about them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform plans of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy,
due to come into force in 2000, there would be sharp reduction in
the level of guaranteed EU support prices for Irish cereals, beef
and milk in the form of direct aid.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Iraqi Pilgrims Leave for Saudi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The first batch of about 1,100
Iraqi pilgrims left here Thursday for Mecca, Saudi Arabia, to
perform Islam's holy pilgrimage, the hajj, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
A farewell ceremony for the pilgrims was organized on the
occasion and attended by Iraqi Minister of Endowments and
Religious Affairs Abdul-Munim Ahmed Saleh and other officials.
</P>
<P>
The hajj is one of Islam's main tenets, requiring the
able-bodied Muslims to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, the birthplace
of Prophet Mohammed, in one's lifetime.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had requested the U.N. sanctions committee to release 44
million U.S. dollars to cover Iraqi pilgrims expenses. The request
was approved on condition that the Iraqi government issued
travelers checks to the pilgrims to enable them to use the
Jordanian means of transportation.
</P>
<P>
The money would be deducted from the U.N.-administered Iraqi
frozen account and be transferred through Jordanian banks.
</P>
<P>
But Iraq rejected the proposal, demanding on grounds of
sovereignty that the money be deposited in the Iraqi central bank.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Iraq sent the first passenger aircraft to Jedda ever
since 1990, transporting 104 sick and aged Iraqi pilgrims to Saudi
Arabia without obtaining the approval of the U.N. Sanctions
Committee. It also sent helicopters to the borders with Saudi
Arabia to carry the pilgrims back.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
believed that the Russian-French-German Summit held in Bor resort
near Moscow marks the beginning of the formation of a real
multipolar world, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said this at a press conference after his meeting with
French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
He said, "It is from here that a multipolar world will evolve, not
from any one state, but from a number of states, a number of
leaders."
</P>
<P>
"It is here that a multipolar approach is being formed, and it
is from here that it will spread around the world," he said,
adding there should be no discrimination against any state in the
modern world.
</P>
<P>
An expanded Europe will become a major force in today's
multipolar world, Yeltsin noted.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Yeltsin, Chirac and Kohl also discussed work
on a European Security Charter.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made it clear that France opposed admission of the three
Baltic countries into NATO, according to Russian presidential
spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders also discussed Iraq problem, the situation in
Armenia's run-up to the presidential elections and the Iran
problem, as well as relations between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Kohl arrived in Moscow on Wednesday for the first
one-day informal summit with Yeltsin and left for home Thursday
evening.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said Thursday the just-ended Franco-African foreign
minister meeting held in Ougadougou, Burkina Faso was transparent
and fruitful.
</P>
<P>
In a statement here after attending the meeting in Burkina
Faso, Seyoum said the meeting at which more than 30 African
countries took part, dealt at length on the security and crisis
in Africa, the Lome Convention, the implementation of the
decisions of the 1996 Burkina Faso summit and preparations for
the summit due to be held in France in November, this year.
</P>
<P>
On conflicts in Africa, Seyoum said, the meeting underlined
the need to consolidate the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
mechanism for conflict prevention, management and resolution and
urged the support of partners to this end.
</P>
<P>
He said, the meeting emphasized that sub-regional
organizations like the Inter-Governmental Authority on
Development (IGAD) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) also need assistance in building their capacity
to fully exploit their understanding about conflicts and crisis
in Africa in the effort to bring about sustainable peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting has also mentioned the importance of the
cooperation on the part of the United Nations Security Council
with regional and sub-regional organizations in the effort to
address the crisis in Africa, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said both France and the African states have accepted
the necessity to revise the Lome Convention signed between the
Africa, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the European Union to
make it compatible to the existing international trade and
economic relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the meeting which deliberated on good-governance
in Africa has underlined the interdependence of good governance,
human rights and economic prosperity.

The victim said that some people attempted to make fortunes
from the mishap and ran toward the deformed mini-buses to loot
passengers' belongings. But they were stopped by nearby police

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The 14 member states of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) have expressed the
hope that the current visit by United States President Bill
Clinton will result in more investment to African countries.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived in Cape Town, the legislative capital of South
Africa Thursday morning, on the fourth leg of his 12-day visit to
Africa.
</P>
<P>
SADC executive secretary Kaire Mbuende said what the region
did not want was for the visit to be seen as nothing more than
opportunities for the U.S. to pledge development aid to Southern
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"What we are hoping for is a serious dialogue on a number of
issues," Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's share of U.S. direct foreign investment was two
percent. There was no justification at all for such a low figure,
given the continent's population and resources.
</P>
<P>
"The only way we can be taken seriously is when we discuss as
equals and not as a giver and a taker," Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
After the showmanship of the visit, the SADC wanted to make
sure it had been taken seriously and send clear signals to the
U.S. that southern Africa was ready to do business.
</P>
<P>
"Our businessmen want to do business and there is potential
here for American investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the signing of a U.S.-SADC memorandum of understanding
on trade and cooperation in 1996 in Gaborone, little had
happened, Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed by the then U.S. secretary for
commerce the late Ron Brown and Mbuende.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his arrival in South Africa, Clinton had visited
Ghana, Uganda and Rwanda. He is also scheduled to tour Botswana
and Senegal.

<HEADLINE> Shares of Tanzania Oxygen Ltd. Sold out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- All of the 7.5 million
shares of the Tanzania Oxygen Limited (TOL) have been sold out,
Omar Malima, managing director of the company said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The company's shares are owned by 10,000 holders, including
individuals and public corporations, such as the National
Provision Fund (NPF) and the Parastatal Pension Scheme (PPS),
Malima said to the press.
</P>
<P>
TOL, a leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial and
medical gases in Tanzania, is the first company in the east
African country to float shares to the public. One share goes at
500 Shillings (about 76 U.S. cents) and the minimum amount one
can buy are 10 shares.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa bought 100 shares with 50,000
shillings (about 76 US Dollars) when he officially launched the
public sales of TOL shares at the Sheraton Hotel on February 6
this year.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Welcomes New Drug Treatment to HIV-AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said on Thursday that a new and strikingly
cost-effective drug treatment against mother-to-children
transmission of HIV during pregnancy will help fuel a major
expansion of the war against AIDS in the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, UNICEF's Executive Director, said the
effectiveness of the new drug regime, together with estimates
of its cost effectiveness, would enable UNICEF and its partners
in the UN System to step up their response to prevent HIV/AIDS
in children.
</P>
<P>
"These recent developments are a breakthrough -- providing
new options for greatly reducing HIV transmission in pregnancy
and childbirth," Bellamy said. "But they also highlight the job
that remains to be done to reduce transmission to women in the
first place, and transmission through breastfeeding."
</P>
<P>
The new treatment involves using the antiretroviral drug AZT.
The procedure, found effective in field trials in Thailand, is
significantly cheaper than current treatments, does not require
intravenous administration, and can be used by women late in
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
"One thousand infants are born with HIV every day, most
of them in developing countries," Bellamy noted. " The new AZT
will make it possible to reduce that total dramatically."

<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri and Interior Minister Habib el-Adli Thursday held
separate meetings with Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa Osman
Ismail on promoting bilateral relations, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Sudan began joint coorpertion in security, political
and economic spheres after having already overcome bones of
contention between them, the Sudanese foreign minister told
reporters after the meetings.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said that these meetings dealt with promoting bilateral
relations and brought them back to track.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday, Ismail said Khartoum and Cairo have overcome
difficulties in their relations and entered into a new phase of
better cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors were at odds over a border dispute and had
traded accusations of harboring militants and oppositions, but
there were signs of a tentative thaw in their relations.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister conveyed to Mubarak a message
from Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir, which deals with bilateral
relations and their future prospects as well as the regional and
international situation.
</P>
<P>
Capping a marked thaw in Cairo-Khartoum ties over the past few
weeks, al-Bashir was expected to visit Egypt shortly, according to
Ismail.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese foreign minister chaired meetings of the 109th
session of the Arab League foreign ministers' council which ended

<HEADLINE> UNEP Helps Africa Cope with Climate Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Environment
Program (UNEP) has undertaken various activities in Africa to
address concerns of the continent in connection with climate
variability and change, a UNEP official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held here at the UNEP headquarters, Alex
Alusa, program officer of UNEP atmosphere unit, said that UNEP
had organized seminars to help African leaders in planning and
preparing for droughts in Africa.
</P>
<P>
An ad hoc Working Group on the El Nino has been set up to
review state of the science on El Nino and provide El Nino
information to African countries as part of an Early Warning
System, he added.
</P>
<P>
Alusa noted that UNEP is concerned with addressing two aspects
of climate affecting Africa, namely the impact of climate
variability on socio-economic systems and the potential impacts
of climate change on eco-systems and the socio-economic system of
countries.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the Second Assessment Report compiled by the
Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change as saying that "as
long as emissions (of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere) are
allowed to continue in a business as usual manner, global warming
will occur and occasion changes in the climate system."
</P>
<P>
The UNEP official noted that sustained increase in mean
ambient temperatures beyond one centigrade degree would cause
significant changes in forest and rangeland cover, species
distribution, composition and migration patterns, and biome
distribution.
</P>
<P>
Many organisms in the deserts are already near their tolerance
limits, and some may not be able to adapt further under hotter
conditions, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Alusa stressed that African continent is particularly
vulnerable to the impacts of climate change because of widespread
poverty, recurrent droughts, inequitable land distribution and
over-dependence on rain-fed agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Although adaptation options theoretically are available, Alusa
said, in practice the human, infrastructural and economic
response capacity to effect timely response actions may well be
beyond the economic means of some countries.
</P>
<P>
As farming depends entirely on the quality of the rainy season
in most African countries, increased droughts could seriously
impact the availability of food for the continent, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNEP official, a warmer environment could
open up new areas for malaria and increase the incidence of
yellow fever, dengue fever, onchocerciasis and trypanosomiasis.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Africa was expected to be at risk primarily
from increased incidences of vector-borne diseases and reduced
nutritional status.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer also addressed the press
conference, saying that he was committed to making UNEP an
integral voice for the environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Global Environment Facility (FEF) had
given UNEP a total of 750 million U.S. Dollars to combat forest
fires in Indonesia and Brazil.

LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 35 percent of Nigerian
women married before the age of 15, the Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) have indicated.
</P>
<P>
Jigawa state in the north has the highest figure of 91
percent, with Niger state in the west records the lowest of 17
percent, FOS said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In its publication titled "Major Social Indicators 1993/94",
FOS said 67 percent of Nigerian households are without
electricity, with the highest at more than 90 percent in eight
states in the northern part and the lowest at three percent in
Lagos, the economic center.
</P>
<P>
The document also revealed that only 49 percent of adults in

</P>
<P>
It said 31 percent of households in the country source their
water supply from streams, ponds or other unsatisfactory places.
</P>
<P>
While 87 percent or nine-tenths of Nigerians dispose of their

<HEADLINE> UN Plans to Step Up Drive to Prevent HIV-AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) is supporting efforts proven to be
successful to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV through
the use of antiretroviral drugs in Thailand, Carol Bellamy, UNICEF's
Executive Director, said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
And efforts will be made over the next three months in a number
of UNICEF-assisted countries with a high prevalence of HIV,
Bellamy said, adding these countries include Botswana, Cote
D'Ivoire, Rwanda, Zambia, Cambodia and Viet Nam.
</P>
<P>
The way to accelerate program efforts includes:
</P>
<P>
-- Improve access to voluntary and confidential HIV counseling
and testing. UNICEF will continue to expand its efforts in this
area, working closely with governments, partner agencies and
non-governmental organizations to ensure that women, particularly
pregnant women, are given the means to know their HIV status.
</P>
<P>
-- Measures to strengthen and expand national and
community responses to HIV-AIDS, particularly in the areas of
awareness and prevention, legal reforms, family care and support,
both emotional and medical, for women who test positive for HIV as
well as measures with careful control targeting and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
-- Infant formula, at affordable prices and in the quantity
needed for about 6 months, for tested women with HIV who make an
informed choice in favor of this alternative. Formula with no
brand labels will be distributed at reduced cost through
existing community-based institutions with careful control,
targeting and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
-- Counseling and other assistance to ensure that families
are aware that formula can be fed by cup rather than feeding
bottles, which introduce additional costs and risks.
</P>
<P>
-- Ensured access to sufficient quantities of clean water,
fuel, soap, clean utensils, and community-level follow up to
ensure the formula is mixed as safely as possible and is fed in
adequate quantities for normal growth and development.
</P>
<P>
-- Partnership with local institutions and health workers,
building on existing UNICEF programs, to improve these
families' access to appropriate milks and foods for their
children beyond 6 months and their capacity to ensure good
feeding practices.
</P>
<P>
-- A monitoring system to assess the impact of the program
services on the survival and development of the children of women
living with HIV, as well as on breastfeeding practices among other
women in the same community.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Wounded in Israeli Shelling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were
wounded in an Israeli shelling of a village in south Lebanon on
Thursday, Lebanon's Voice of People radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The two civilians were slightly wounded when Israeli troops
bombed the village of Balera Shiit, which borders the Israeli
self-styled security zone set up in 1985 to buffer guerrilla
attacks on its northern areas.
</P>
<P>
The blast, which damaged several homes in the village, came in
retaliation for Hezbollah fighters' raid earlier on an Israeli
post in the zone, according to the radio.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla group Hezbollah, or Party of God, is spearheading
a campaign to oust Israeli troops out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that Lebanon would file a complaint over the
bombardment to a five-nation monitoring committee comprising
Lebanon, Israel, Syria, France and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The committee has the job to supervise the execution of a 1996
ceasefire which bans firing from or at civilian targets on both
sides of the Lebanese-Israeli border.

<HEADLINE> France Responds to Clinton's Statement in Rwanda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- France Thursday responded to the
statement made by U.S. President Bill Clinton in Rwanda, pointing
out that France asked for a reinforcement of U.N. peacekeeping
force in Rwanda when the genocide was taking place in the Spring
of 1994, but no one supported it.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said in Kigali, capital of Rwanda, on Wednesday that
both the international community and the United States bear a
heavy responsibility for failing to intervene in Rwanda during the
genocide, in which 500,000 to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus
were killed by the country's Hutu military.
</P>
<P>
"France, after the tragic events on April 6 of 1994 in Rwanda,
launched a heavy diplomatic campaign at the United Nations asking
it not to withdraw the MINUAR intervention force which was already
in Rwanda at that moment," said French Foreign Ministry
spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-Secret.
</P>
<P>
France asked U.N. to enlarge the peacekeeping force up to 5,500
soldiers, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
"Such a reinforced operation by the United Nations as was
called for by France at that time was not supported by anybody.
Nobody answered the pleading by France at that time," she said.
</P>
<P>
France has created a parliament mission of information on the
role France played in Rwanda from 1990 to 1994, after Paris was
accused of supporting the Hutus by some independent investigators
both at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Women's Guild Sponsors Chernobyl Children's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Women's
Guild is sponsoring eight children who are victims of the 1986
Chernobyl accident to visit the United States for three weeks
starting Friday, 27 March, the United Nations Department of
Public Information (DPI) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the United Nations Women's Guild has worked in
cooperation with, and given its financial support to, the Oncology
Hospital in Minsk and the Children in Trouble Foundation of
Belarus. Approximately 5,000 children are on the waiting lists to
participate in this program, the DPI said.
</P>
<P>
Planned activities for the children include a visit to the
United Nations, a trip to the Broadway show "The Beauty and the
Beast," the Bronx Zoo, the Empire State Building and Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
The prognosis for these children is devastating. Without
rehabilitation, there is little or no hope that they will reach
their twenty-first birthday. The children, four girls and four
boys, range in ages from nine to 12 years. They will be
accompanied by a paediatrician and a translator.
</P>
<P>
The April 1986 explosion at Reactor 4 of the Chernobyl Nuclear
Power Plant was the worst in world history. There was severe
radioactive contamination in the area, resulting in the evacuation
of people from a 30-kilometer zone around the power plant. It has
become clear over the 12 years following the accident that the
children are the ones to suffer most.
</P>
<P>
The DPI said the United Nations Women's Guild is hoping to make
this visit to the United States an annual event and seeks the
support of the media to help make some of the dreams of these and
other young victims of Chernobyl come true.

<HEADLINE> Former French President Opposes Rightwing Union Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Former French President Valery
Giscard d'Estaing said Thursday that he opposes a split of the
center-right union between the Gaullist Rally for the Republic
(RPR) and the Union for French Democracy (UDF).
</P>
<P>
"The union of the RPR-UDF, if it breaks up, will not have any
chance to play an important role in the national life. Union is a
property which should be preserved at any price," said d'Estaing
in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
RPR President Philippe Seguin said Wednesday that his party
could present itself alone in future elections, instead of as a
twin party with the UDF, after the UDF was plunged into a deep
crisis following the regional elections on March 15.
</P>
<P>
Five UDF politicians allied with the far-right National Front
(FN) in election of presidents of regional councils, while a UDF
politician has announced a plan to set up a new party to replace
the UDF.
</P>
<P>
D'Estaing was reelected the regional council president of
Auvergne while representing the UDF.
</P>
<P>
He expressed disagreement with the president of the
UDF-affiliated Democratic Force party, Francois Bayrou, who
announced a plan Wednesday to establish a new party to replace the
UDF.
</P>
<P>
"The solution of the problems of France will not come from the
parties.... If the UDF reorganizes itself and changes its name, it
will have neither advantage nor inconvenience," said d'Estaing.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Charles Millon, the former defense minister who
was re-elected to the presidency of the regional council of
Rhone-Alpes with the votes from the FN, should resign from his
post, d'Estaing said that it is up to Millon himself to decide.

<HEADLINE> Greece Rejects U.S. Proposal on Military Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday expressed its
opposition to the U.S. proposal for a moratorium on military
flights over Cyprus, saying that Athens did not regard such a
proposal as a substantial step towards the demilitarization of the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that in contrast, Athens and Nicosia believed
that the installation of Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles
would be "a substantial step towards demilitarization in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the missiles would not be installed
as scheduled unless steps were taken towards the full
demilitarization of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops occupied
the northern third of the island in the wake of an abortive coup
backed by Athens.
</P>
<P>
To bolster its defenses, Cyprus signed earlier last year a
contract with Russia to purchase and install the S-300 missiles,
but this did lead to opposition from northern Cyprus, Turkey and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to do everything possible to prevent
Nicosia from installing the missiles or launch a military strike
against the anti-aircraft systems.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves 18 Bln Dlrs for IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted 84 to 16
Thursday in support of President Bill Clinton's request for 18
billion U.S. dollars to help the International Monetary Fund to
deal with the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
who has called the Asian crisis the "El Nino of economics," told
the Senate that failure to deal with the issue promptly would rock
financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had been
recently closing in on 9,000 points. "If we don't act, the country
(had) better get ready for a slide on that," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The vote, attaching the entire IMF package to an emergency
spending bill for disaster relief and military operations, sets up
an expected confrontation with the House.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders have said they want to deal with the
IMF issue separately from the disaster legislation.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., an opponent, said that IMF
austerity programs serve to further impoverish populations and
result in cheap exports that undercut American products.
</P>
<P>
"We should use our leverage to change the flawed policies of
the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., a supporter, argued, "You can't
remodel the emergency room at the very time patients are being
brought in."
</P>
<P>
The Senate package includes conditions, negotiated between
Republicans and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, urging the
world's major industrial nations to work to reform IMF loaning
practices.
</P>
<P>
A House version, not expected to see floor action until after
an upcoming April recess, imposes much stricter conditions on the
IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the Senate also adopted a nonbinding
measure by a vote 90-10, calling on the United Nations to
"immediately reduce" the U.S. share of the cost of peacekeeping
operations from about 30 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, told the Senate that U.S. costs in the Gulf and
supporting peacekeeping operations in Bosnia far surpass the
arrearages in U.N. dues, which he called "money which we do not
owe and should never pay."

Clinton, who arrived in Cape Town Thursday morning for a
four-day state visit, played down differences between the U.S.
and South Africa, saying that like all partners they could not
agree on everything.
</P>
<P>
"Some times our interests and our views diverge, but that is
true even in family partnerships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not give in to demands from those, including the
South African Communist Party, who hoped for an apology for
successive U.S. government's roles in aiding the former apartheid
regime.
</P>
<P>
White House Press Secretary Mike Mccurry later told reporters
that "President Clinton has pitched his remarks into the future,
he elected not to dwell on the U.S. government's policy in the
past."
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Thursday, Clinton had put his words into practice
when he showed off his building skills at a self-help housing
project in the Cape Town city.
</P>
<P>
He said the project could prove a model for the rest of Africa
and the world, and promised an extra three million U.S. Dollars
in aid for it and similar projects in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
A courtesy call later by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki at
Clinton's hotel saw South Africa's future leader responding to a
newspaper report that he had attacked Clinton's flagship Africa
Growth and Opportunity Bill.
</P>
<P>
The report, based on an interview with a French magazine,
quoted Mbeki as saying that Clinton's bill is wrong.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also met leaders of opposition political parties after
his address in parliament, in what was described as informal
talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. leader is due to hold bilateral talks with Mandela on
Friday and several contentious issues are expected to be
discussed, including South Africa's controversial medicines
control legislation, which the U.S. drug industry believes
violates their patent rights.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will also reportedly try to persuade Mandela to bring
South Africa into an international anti-corruption initiative.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is expected to invest Clinton with South Africa's
highest award, the Order of Good Hope, at Friday's state banquet.
</P>
<P>
On how Clinton would feel accepting the award -- he will share
it with his arch foe Libyan leader Muammar Gadaffi and others --
Mccurry said it had been given to a range of individuals and "the
President will accept that in the spirit in which it is given."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Incomes Maintain Strong Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. national personal
income rose 0.6 percent in February for the second consecutive
month, the Commerce Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 7.14
trillion U.S. dollars, exceeded the healthy 0.4 percent increase
in spending, to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.66 trillion
dollars, the department said.
</P>
<P>
Spending rose 0.7 percent in January, revised up from a
previous estimate of 0.4 percent, the highest rise in last six
months.
</P>
<P>
Strong income gains in recent months reflect continued demand
for labor and an unemployment rate that dipped to a 24-year low of
4.6 percent in February. Personal spending has been stimulated by
low interest rates, a result of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, some experts believe that by the second half of the
year, the Asian economic crisis will cause slower employment
growth, and thus slower income growth.
</P>
<P>
Most categories of income increased in February, including the
most important wages and salaries, up 0.9 percent after a 0.8
percent gain in January. Also higher were business owners' income,
transfer payments such as welfare and Social Security and interest
and dividend income. Farmers' income, however, declined for the
second consecutive month. Rental income also fell.
</P>
<P>
Disposable personal income or income after taxes, rose 0.6
percent, following a 0.8 percent gain the month before.
</P>
<P>
Because after-tax income grew faster than spending, Americans'
savings rate crept up from 4.2 percent in January to 4.3 percent
in February, also the highest in eight months.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Expert Calls for Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A leading Bangladeshi economist on
Friday called for transparency and accountability in planning and
carrying out development activities.
</P>
<P>
"In an aid-dependent country, unless donors design their aid
package according to the plans and programs of the aid-recipient
country, planning becomes a meaningless exercise," Professor
Mosharaff Hossain told the inaugural session of an international
workshop on planning, monitoring and evaluation, which opened here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the amount of over 30 billion U.S. dollars
Bangladesh received during the last two and a half decades had
been properly used, the levels of poverty, malnutrition and
unemployment in the country would have been much lower than what
is the case today.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the Christian Commission for Development in
Bangladesh, the seven-day workshop was attended by 35 participants
from 14 countries, including the Netherlands and Peru.

Ferrari have been joined by Minardi, Sauber, Tyrrell and Arrows

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are some major
news items in leading U. S. newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton appeared before the South
African Parliament, calling for a "genuine partnership" between
the United States and South Africa, citing the concept of
multiracial democracy and noting that the descendents of African
slaves had become American leaders.
</P>
<P>
-- Switzerland's three major banks agreed to negotiate a global
settlement with victims of the Holocaust, marking a reversal in
their position after the threat of sanctions hurt business and
soured reputations.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton administration on Thursday unveiled a radical
restructuring of the nation's system for allocating scarce,
donated organs to ensure that the sickest patients get transplants
first.
</P>
<P>
-- Justice Department officials are scouring the U.S. criminal
code to determine whether the two boys arrested in the Jonesboro
school shooting might serve longer sentences if they are tried
under some sort of federal law.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate approved IMF funding, but a tougher fight
awaits in the House. The vote on the 18 billion U.S. dollars
measure to help deal with the Asian financial crisis was 84-16. In
a maneuver by Appropriations Chairman Stevens, it was attacked to
an emergency spending bill, ensuring IMF funding is on the table
when it is reconciled with a House version. House leaders have
held up IMF funds seeking leverage in areas such as abortion.
</P>
<P>
-- U.N. weapons inspectors searched one of Saddam Husssein's
palaces for eight hours in a test of Iraqi compliance with the deal
brokered recently by the U.N. secretary general. Diplomats from 20
nations accompanied the inspection team. A German envoy later said
no area was put off-limits.

MANILA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Japan will provide a new economic
adjustment support loan of two billion yen (about 16 million U.S.
dollars) for the Philippines to continue its economic
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
An accord on the assistance was signed here Friday by
Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary Domingo Siazon and Japanese
Ambassador to Manila Hiroyuki Yushita.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the Philippine Foreign Department said the grant
is intended to enhance the Philippines' efforts to sustain its
economic momentum through further structural adjustments in the
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
The grant is part of Japan's "Emergency Measures to Stabilize
the Southeast Asian Economies" announced February this year in
Tokyo by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, they said.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the Philippines' second largest trading partner and
foreign investor, and the biggest provider of Official Development
Assistance.
</P>
<P>
Japan had provided a total of 7.4 billion U.S. dollars in
official development assistance to the Philippines from 1985 to
1996.

<HEADLINE> Fiji Beats Chinese Taipei in Hong Kong Rugby International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Seven-time Cup winner and
defending champiom Fiji made a flying start by trouncing
lowly-fancied Chinese Taipei 61-0 on the opening day of the Credit
Suisse First Boston Hong Kong Rugby Sevens '98 tournament here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Hottest for the title of the 510,000 U.S. dollars tournament as
the World Cup holder from last year's meet here, Fiji scored four
tries and as many conversions to lead the first half 28-0. It
added 33 more points in the second half to seal the triumph.
</P>
<P>
Fiji meets Papus New Guinea on Saturday morning and takes on
Argentina in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
With its national team making debut appearance at the Hong Kong
event, China was no match to the experienced Samoan side, Cup
winner here in 1993. The Chinese lost its opening match 69-0.
</P>
<P>
China, who began its first ever rugby program just six years
ago, is trying to gain further international experience from the
famed Hong Kong tournament and to prepare for their possible
first-time show at the Asian Games this December in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
All the Chinese players were picked up from the teams of the
Beijing-based China Agricultural University and the People's
Liberationn Army Sports Institute in Guangzhou in South China.
</P>
<P>
"Our players were nervous on playing their first major
tournament of this caliber today and they made really too many
unforced mistakes in the game," said Chinese coach Zheng Hongjun.
</P>
<P>
"We were in a very passive position during the game and were
made exhausted by Samoans' tricky game," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese coach was not expecting a winning chance in their
next game Saturday morning against Tonga, Plate winner at last
year's World Cup meet here. But he hoped to see his side to make
a better performance in their final preliminary match Saturday
afternoon against Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The single round-robin play in fact gave Fiji some pleasant
time to warm-up as it had been pooled into Group C, with
comparatively easy opponents Argentina, Papua New Guinea and
Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
But in their way to the crown might be the powerful All Blacks
team from New Zealand, winner of the Cup two years ago.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, with six Cup wins to its credit, proved to be too
strong for the Singaporeans in their opening match on Friday. New
Zealander Brad Flemming opened the score with his try 43 seconds
into the first half and the team led 33-0 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
The All Blacks increased the lead in the second half through
their swift and powerful attempts to sealing up the match by a
big-margined triumph.
</P>
<P>
Five-time Cup winner Australia downed Sri Lanka 59-0 in their
first-day match.
</P>
<P>
Host Hong Kong SAR, runner-up in the Plate tournament at last
year's World Cup meet, downed Japan 33-7 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Winners of the six preliminary groups of four and the best two
runners-up advance to the top-class Cup tournament on Sunday. The
four remaining runners-up and the top four third-placed sides go
to the second-ranked Plate tournament, while the eight remaining
teams play in the Bowl tournament, both on the tournament's
closing day on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Barre Calls for Better Way to Fight FN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister
Raymond Barre Friday called on the mainstream right wing to seek a
better way to fight the far-right National Front (FN).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Le Figaro, Barre said that the Gaullist
Rally for the Republic and Union for French Democracy (UDF) should
do better in the fields which the FN is taking advantage of, such
as illegal immigration and crimes.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important to fight in a systematic way by
showing the unrealistic nature of its stands, stressing the harm
to France, and working on a number of themes being exploited by
FN, such as the control of immigration, security, and by making a
more efficient policy," said Barre.
</P>
<P>
The FN rocked the right-wing opposition in the regional
elections on March 15 when five UDF politicians accepted its votes
in the election of council presidents.
</P>
<P>
Barre expressed his reservation over the idea of banning FN,
pointing out that such a move could greatly increase the sympathy
for the far-right.
</P>

"It is very difficult in a democratic country to ban ... a
party which respects the rules of public order," he said. "What I
fear is that a banning will result in a surge of votes in favor of
the extreme-right."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his opposition to the alliance between FN and
five UDF politicians, saying: "The end does not justify means."
</P>
<P>
Two of the five UDF regional presidents elected with FN votes
have sice resigned. Pressure is mounting on Charles Millon, the
president of regional council of Rhone-Alpes. But Jacques Blanc,
president of the council in French Catalonia, has vowed to remain
in his post.
</P>
<P>
Barre, who is a close friend of Millon's, said in the interview
that he could not understand why Millon accepted FN votes, and
estimated that a resignation would be a necessary clarification
of the confusion caused by what he called a major fault.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview on Thursday, former French President
Valery Giscard D'Estaing, the founder of UDF, refused to criticize
Millon.

<HEADLINE> Textile Official: Smooth Arrangement for Laid-off Workers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Textile workers declared
redundant as a result of restructuring will not create major
contradictions, according to Xu Kunyuan, vice-chairman of the
China National Textile Council (CNTC).
</P>
<P>
Xu said that effective measures introduced by both the central
government and various local governments will ensure the proper
relocation of workers.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has decided to promote breakthroughs in
invigorating medium- and large-sized state-owned enterprises by
slashing the excessive production capacity of the cotton spinning
industry. Over the next three years, 10 million obsolete spindles
will be destroyed and 1.2 million workers will be relocated. The
country plans to relocate 600,000 redundant workers this year.
</P>
<P>
Central government officials point out the most difficult
aspect involved in the restructuring effort will center on making
proper arrangements for redundant workers.
</P>
<P>
Xu stressed that restructuring will be carried out in a planned
manner, with related efforts focusing on coastal areas and major
cities.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of redundant workers in the aforementioned
areas will be greater than in less developed inland and remote
area.
</P>
<P>
The work on relocating laid-off workers will exert pressure on
society since they will be concentrated in terms of both geography
and time periods, according to official with the Labor Department
in east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
She said that the coordinated efforts of the government,
society, enterprises and workers will effectively solve related
problems.
</P>
<P>
CNTC liaison officials dispatched to provinces throughout the
nation, including the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Shandong and
Jiangsu, as well as Tianjin and Shanghai have achieved concrete
progress in relocating redundant workers.
</P>
<P>
Financial subsidies for cotton mills involved in the spindle
reduction effort have been distributed in a timely manner. For
example, the Zhoushan Cotton Mill in Zhejiang received 1.5 million
yuan in subsidies last week on the very day it dismantled some
10,000 cotton spindles last week.

<HEADLINE> Fertilizer Consumption Rises in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Fertilizer consumption in
Ethiopia has shown a marked progress over the past few years as
more farmers realized the advantages of the input, the National
Fertilizer Industry Agency said.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the agency, Zeleke Desalegne told local
journalists Friday that 25-30 percent of the Ethiopian farmers
now use fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
He said annual fertilizer consumption was limited to 3,500
tons between 1959 and 1964 and the consumption has now zoomed
following the expansion in the agricultural extension program.
</P>
<P>
Zeleke said over 325,000 tons of fertilizers has been imported
this year, and among them, fifty-five percent of the fertilizers
is imported by the government and the remaining 45 percent by
private importers.
</P>
<P>
He said 95 percent of the fertilizers is used to cultivate
teff, wheat, barley and maize.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia plans to import 368,000 tons of fertilizers this
year. It imported 320,000 tons and 270,000 tons of fertilizers in
1996 and 1995 respectively.

<P>
Local governments have established reemployment projects and
relocated redundant workers through numerous channels.
</P>
<P>
The Zhoushan Mill has used various channels to relocate 680
redundant workers. For example, the mill has transferred a number
of workers to a subsidiary electronic products plant, encouraged
others to resign and seek employment on their own, dismissed
contract workers, granted early retirements and sent various
people to other enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The nation's major cities have established reemployment centers
for redundant textile workers. Reemployment centers in Shanghai
have helped 210,000 workers find new jobs over the past two
years. The centers plan to provide services for an additional
100,000 workers during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang plans to establish a computer network linking
reemployment centers in various localities. The new network is
expected to enable the centers to improve efficiency in finding
new jobs for workers.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have set minimum wages and subsistence
allowances to support redundant workers facing difficulties. Local
governments also guarantee medical and pension insurance for
workers and ensures that either a husband or wife remains employed.
</P>
<P>
Xu pointed to the difficult tasks related to restructuring
the textile industry and downsizing the work force.
</P>
<P>
Textile enterprises employ over 1.8 million people, or close to
20 percent of the total number of employees working for the
loss-making large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have set goals of providing proper
arrangements for a fixed number of redundant textile workers in
each of the next three years. They will also place priority on
reemploying textile workers.
</P>
<P>
CNTC officials noted that successfully restructuring the
textile industry will provide valuable experience for the reform
of all other medium to large state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Plans to Offer Shelter for Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 2 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean capital of Seoul
has announced plans to provide accommodation for "street dwellers"
whose number is rising due to country's economic hardships.
</P>
<P>
The municipality announced its plans after Acting Mayor Kang
Deok-ki Wednesday inspected outdoor shelters frequented by the
homeless, including high-way underpasses.
</P>
<P>
The city proposes to convert a four-story state-owned building,
formerly used as a worker's welfare center, into a homeless
shelter.
</P>
<P>
The municipality will soon begin talks with the Ministry of
Finance and Economy, the current owner of the downtown building.
</P>
<P>
Some of the street dwellers are genuinely homeless, while a
number are too shy to go home after losing jobs or other reasons.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last month, more than 1.2 million people were
unemployed because of a severe slowdown of domestic demand,
corporate financial troubles and high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, once the 11th largest economy in the world, was
hit by a serious financial crisis produced by corporate
bankruptcies and bad loans of financial institution in late
1997.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Foreign Exchange Reserve Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 27 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign exchange
reserve rose an average 100 million U.S. dollars each day this
month to hit 21.77 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The total on March 25 was up from February's 18.54 billion
dollars, the Ministry of Finance and Economy announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure, just above the ministry's target of 20 billion
dollars by the end of this month, met the requirements of the
International Monetary Fund in an agreement with South Korea last
December after its financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
With a loan of two billion dollars from the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development at the end of this month, South
Korean foreign exchange holdings are likely to exceed 24 billion
dollars before April.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign exchange reserve has been on a steady
rise after hitting a record low of 7.26 billion dollars last
November.
</P>
<P>
The reserve grew to 12.36 billion dollars in January after the
country signed the agreement with the IMF for a rescue loan of 57
billion dollars last December.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the steady growth of the foreign exchange
reserve to increased trade surplus in the past three months and the
smooth inflow of funds from the IMF and other international
institutions.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which plans to increase its foreign currency
reserve to 40.7 billion dollars by the end of this year, will
issue state bonds valued at three billion dollars in the United
States and Europe beginning April 6.

<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said today that China supports the reasonable initiatives
and suggestions of the Workers Party of Korea and the government
of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to ease the
sitution on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
China fully supports the efforts made by the two sides on the

through dialog and consultations, and eventually realize national
reunification on a self-reliant and peaceful basis, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during a meeting with a visiting DPRK
delegation led by Vice-Foreign Minister Chon Jae Hong.
</P>
<P>
Tang said the Communist Party of China and the Chinese
government have consistently attached great importance to its
traditional friendly ties with the DPRK. He added that the new
government of China will continue to implement this policy.
</P>
<P>
The international situation is undergoing great and profound
changes, and the strengthening of Sino-Korean friendly relations
will not only be in the fundamental interests of the two nations
and the two peoples, but also be conducive to peace and stability
in Northeast Asia, Tang said.

"China is willing to continue its sincere efforts to help
achieve this end," said Tang.

here as guest of the Foreign Ministry. He said the friendship
forged by the older generation of leaders of both countries has
taken roots amongst the people of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
He said Kim Jong Il has extended great effort to promote the
development of friendly ties with China. He expressed confidence
that joint efforts will ensure the relationship continues to grow
on the basis of "mutual support and cooperation".
</P>
<P>
Chon briefed Tang on the domestic situation in his country, and
noted that severe natural disasters in recent years have created
difficulties for his country's economic development and hardships
for the Korean people.
</P>
<P>
"The people of the DPRK are fully confident with their future
under the leadership of Comrade Kim Jong Il," said Chon.
</P>
<P>
He expressed sincere gratitude for China's assistance in
helping the DPRK overcome economic difficulties.
</P>

<P>
BONN, March 27 (xinhua) -- The German Parliament has rejected a
bill urging looser control over granting German nationality.
</P>
<P>
The 662-seat German parliament voted against the bill by
388 to 317.
</P>
<P>
The bill, proposed by the main opposition Social Democrat
Party, would have made it easier for children born to immigrant
parents to acquire German nationality.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of citizenship laws have long been debated
in Germany. The 85-year-old law bases nationality on German
ancestry and allows no dual citizenship for those with
foreign-born parents.
</P>
<P>
The issue of liberalizing the citizenship law can only be
discussed in parliament again after the general elections in
September.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Justice Secretary Visits Supreme People's Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Elsie Leung Oi-sie, secretary of
justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR),
visited the Supreme People's Court this afternoon and held talks
with Zhu Mingshan, the court's vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Zhu told Leung that increasing exchanges between the legal
sectors in inland areas and the HKSAR under the principle of "one
country, two systems" will greatly enhance mutual understanding
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Since the return of Hong Kong to the motherland, the Basic Law
of the HKSAR has been carried out in a comprehensive way, said
Zhu, adding that smooth implementation of the Basic Law is an
important task of the legal sectors in inland areas and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that both sides will work to ensure
the success of the implementation.
</P>
<P>
Leung briefed Zhu on the HKSAR Department of Justice, and noted
that discussions with various departments have enabled her to gain
a better understanding of the legal system in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on judicial contacts and
legal training programs between inland areas and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Leung also held talks with leading officials from the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao
Affairs Office, the Department of Justice, the Department of
Public Security and the Commission of Legislative Affairs under
the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will return to Hong Kong on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Automakers Urge South Korea to Lower Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. automakers have appealed
to South Korea to lower its tariffs on imported U.S. automobiles
and revise its tariff system on engine capacity.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, Ford and Chrysler made the appeal on Friday
when their representatives met Lee Tae-shik, director of the
Regional Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
</P>
<P>
They urged South Korea to cut the tariff on limousines by 2.5
percent from the current eight percent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came just before another round of talks between
South Korea and the United States on freeing up the South Korean
auto market, scheduled for the next month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. automakers complained that South Korea's current
tariff system, which imposes heavy duties on large engine limousines,
apparently discriminates against foreign automobiles. South Korean
cars are usually equipped with small engines.
</P>
<P>
But South Korea has insisted that its limousine tariff of eight
percent is much lower than that of the European Union member
states.
</P>
<P>
South Korea plans to revise its imported auto tariff system
based on engine capacity which was made in accordance with its
road conditions, traffic safety, environment and tax revenues.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Warlord Gives 48-Hour Ultimatum to Vacate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Afghan ethnic-Uzbek warlord
Rashid Dostum has served an ultimatum to the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat
faction to leave Mazar-e-Sharif, about 300 km north of Kabul,
within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, a general attack would be launched against the
faction, a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Dostum, who once formed the dominant power
in control of Mazar-e-Sharif, headquarters of Afghan anti-Taliban
alliance, has been attempting to regain control of the city.
</P>
<P>
Mazar-e-Sharif, the only largest city outside the control of
the Islamic Taliban militia, was taken by the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat
late last year when it led a massive defense of the city from a
major Taliban assault in September, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Dostum and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wahdat faction,
two major factions of the ant-Taliban alliance, have intensified
recently inside the city, the report said.

<HEADLINE> European Airbus Producers to Form Single Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The four major European Airbus
producers in France, Germany, Britain and Spain announced Friday
plans to form a new single company for producing the passenger
planes.
</P>
<P>
Aerospatiale, British Aerospace, Daimler-Benz Aerspace and CASA
announced that they had reached "an agreement of principle on the
objectives, scale and operational structure of a future unified
European company".
</P>
<P>
"The four partners of Airbus, as well as their respective
governments, have a strategic interest in the construction of a
strong aerospace industry," they said without providing further
details.
</P>
<P>
The heads of the four companies have reportedly submitted a
confidential report to European governments on a wholesale
restructuring of Europe's aerospace and military industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
The move came after French President Jacques Chirac, German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and British Prime Minister Tony Blair last
December asked European aerospace enterprises to submit a
memorandum by March 31 with detailed proposals on building a
European civil and defense aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
Some other European aerospace giants, such as the Dassault
Aviation and Lagardere defense electronics group of France, the
Finmeccanica of Italy and Saab aircraft-maker of Sweden, are also
included in the project.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's National Drug Abuse Forum Inaugurated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A national drug abuse forum for
Kenya was inaugurated Friday in response to growing drug abuse in
the country and to mark the U.N. General Assembly special session
on Drugs to be held in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Koli Kouame, representative of the Regional Office for East
and Southern Africa of the U.N. International Drug Control
Program (UNDCP) told a press conference here on Friday that UNDCP
fully supported the forum.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the establishment of the Kenya
forum would serve as a precursor to the formation of other forum
chapters in Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inaugural meeting would bring together more
than 50 non-governmental organizations, nine student associations
and a number of concerned private groups and individuals.
</P>
<P>
A community-wide participatory and partnership approach is
crucial to the accurate assessment of the drug problem and to
addressing the need for the provision of prevention and treatment
programs, the U.N. official stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kouame told reporters that an experts meeting held here
between March 17 and March 19 drafted an African common position
on drug control which was expected to form the core statements by
high-level African officials who would attend the U.N. special
session.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. special session will focus on six
specific topics, namely the control of chemical precursors,
amphetamine-type stimulants, judicial cooperation, money
laundering, drug demand reduction and elimination of illicit
crops.
</P>
<P>
According to Kouame, the amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) are
the principal synthetic drugs manufactured clandestinely and a
wave of synthetic stimulant abuse has been reported in recent
years with a 16-percent average annual increase of quantity
seized from 1978 to 1993.
</P>
<P>
Kouame noted that as some 30 million people consume ATS
throughout the world now, the U.N. special session would give
higher priority to the subject and adopt an "Action Plan Against
Manufacture, Trafficking and Abuse of ATS and Their Precursors".

<TEXT>

KUALA LUMPUR, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will continue with
its deportation exercise despite the rioting by illegal immigrants
resisting repatriation in three detention camps Thursday, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Riots took place at the detention camps in Semenyih in Selangor
State, Lenggeng in Negeri Sembilan State, and Macap Umbo in
Malacca State, resulting in nine deaths including one policeman
and eight illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The riots also caused some 30 more injured.
</P>
<P>
According to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama,
Mahathir, who is also Home Minister, told reporters after a
political party function in the northern state of Kedah that
repatriating the illegal immigrants was not easy as it involved
security convoys and this required a lot of money.

<HEADLINE> Mauritius Tops Africa Competitiveness List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Mauritius heads the list of
competitiveness in 23 African countries, according to a report of
the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
The list features in the Africa Competitiveness Report 1998
published by WEF with the Harvard Institute of International
Development, said a WEF press release received here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius, the report says, has made great strides since
gaining independence 30 years ago and has become one of the
region's most vibrant economies.
</P>
<P>
Averaging an annual six percent growth rate, the country is
also cited as one of the best offshore locations for business. It
has an export-led growth program spearheaded by a well-functioning
export processing zone.
</P>
<P>
Tunisia, second on the list, has had an average growth of 4.5
percent over the past decade. With a real gross domestic product
of just under 14 billion U.S. dollars, Tunisia's economy is four
times larger than either Botswana or Mauritius. Tunisia is looking
towards increasing trade centered on agreements with the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, upon achieving independence, was classified as one of
the world's most impoverished countries. Three decades later, the
country has become a solid member of the World Bank's group of
middle income countries. Its GDP of 4.6 percent is Africa's third
largest.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's successful attempts at healing the wounds of its
recent war have pushed it to fourth place. Its export-oriented
economy, good infrastructure and membership in the Southern
African Customs Union has assured the country of a modest two
percent per capita growth rate.
</P>
<P>
Although South Africa ranks seventh, the report points out, it
has the continent's largest economy. It has shown tremendous
performance in making a peaceful transition to democratic rule.
While growth in economic terms has not been particularly high, the
nation has maintained stability under circumstances which most
observers had expected would lead to civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
As a special project within the framework of the WEF's Global
Competitiveness Report, the Africa Competitiveness Report 1998 is
the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
Incorporated since 1971 as a foundation, the Geneva-based WEF
is an independent and non-profit organization. It has a
consultative status with the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique's Foreign Debt Hits 11 Billion U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's foregin debt hit
about 11 billion U.S. dollars, much of which has been accumulated
due to interests, the daily Noticias quoted a government official
as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Graeme Saul, member of the government group dealing with
foreign debt, said that the heavy burden of its foreign debt has
seriously hindered the growth of Mozambique's economy and the
improvement of people's living.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to considerably
reduce Mozambique's debt.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of Mozambique's debt, or 7.453 billion U.S.
dollars, has been borrowed from the Paris Club which groups
Russia, Italy, France, Germany, Portugal and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The debt owed to Russia is some 2.5 billion U.S. dollars,
largely resulting from Mozambique's purchase of the Russian
military materials in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Mmultilateral debt reaches about 1.5 billion U.S. dollars,
which includes 850 million U.S. dollars owed to the World Bank,
some 180 millions U.S. dollars to the International Monetary Fund
and the same amount to the African Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has a bilateral debt of about 730 million U.S.
dollars, which is mainly owed to sixteen countries outside the
Paris Club, such as Algeria, Libya and Angola.
</P>
<P>
About 930 million U.S. Dollars are of commercial debts for the
construction of the Cahora Bassa Hydroelectric Power Station.
Though constructed, the station in which Mozambique owns 18
percent of its shares, has never generated any electricity for a
variety of reasons, only leaving a debt of about 3.2 billion U.S.
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Urban Living Standards Hit New High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The living standards of China's
urbanites have basically reached a benchmark level featuring rising
incomes and significant changes in the consumption mix, according
to the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
A recent SSB survey placed the average 1997 urban income
level at 5,160 yuan (632.53 US dollars), up a dramatic 155 percent
on the 1992 figure, with the average annual increase standing at
20.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Rising income levels were accompanied by major changes in the
consumption mix. The SSB report indicated a downward trend in the
proportion of expenditures on food, garments and household
appliances in recent years, with a sharp increase in spending on
education, culture activities, entertainment, medical and health
care, transportation, telecommunications and housing.
</P>
<P>
Last year's per capita spending for transportation and
telecommunications stood at 233 yuan, 5.3 times the figure for
1992 and a level topping all other consumption categories.
</P>
<P>
Per capita expenditures on medical and health care stood at 180
yuan, an 3.3-fold rise on 1992. Estimated education expenditures
were placed at 238 yuan, a dramatic 270 percent rise over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, of every 100 urban families, 54 owned their
own homes wholly or partly, 69 lived in apartments with at least
two bedrooms, 59 used gas for cooking and 69 had telephones.
</P>
<P>
The government reform plan calls for the overall national
average to reach "basically well-off" standards by the year 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Victor
Ciorbea has defied mounting pressure within the government and
declared that he will not resign.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement, Ciorbea said Thursday he was
acting for the "stability of the nation".
</P>
<P>
He had been recommended for the post by the coalition and
approved by the parliament and president, he added.
</P>
<P>
Those wanting him to resign would have to go through the legal
channels by staging a no-confidence vote of his government,
otherwise he would not tender his resignation, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Romania's governing coalition has been in turmoil since early
this year, as the second largest partner of the coalition, the
Democratic Party, lost confidence in Ciorbea who belongs to the
Christian Democrat National Peasants' Party.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party called on Ciorbea's government to resign
by the end of March and withdrew from the coalition in January.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
voiced his support for Sergei Kiriyenko to become Russia's new
prime minister on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government and the presidential office would also support
Kiriyenko at the head of a new cabinet, Yeltsin said on national
radio.
</P>
<P>
After Yeltsin dismissed the government on March 23, Kiriyenko
was appointed acting prime mnister and nominated to take the
office on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko became the energy minister last November. His
performance in the ministry won praise from his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
As an independent politician, the 35-year-old Kiriyenko is
skillful in keeping contacts with different parties, said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The president also refuted allegations that Kiriyenko is too
young to lead a government, saying that ability and energy do not
depend on one's age.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that he had never doubted the loyalty and fidelity
of former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, and he had asked
Chernomyrdin to prepare for the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Chernomyrdin can make more contributions to Russia,"
the president said.

<HEADLINE> 1.5 Percent Pay Rise Proposed for German Public Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany's 3.2 million public sector
workers could be in line for a 1.5 percent pay rise from January
1 of this year.
</P>
<P>
The rise was recommended early Friday after negotiations
between mediators, trade unions and employers, but it still needs
to be reviewed by trade unions, which will make a final decision
on April 2.
</P>
<P>
It was also proposed that the wage level of public service
employees in eastern Germany should be raised by 1.5 percent from
September 1 to 86.5 percent of that of their fellow workers in the
west, and stay there till December 1999.
</P>
<P>
The pay dispute was brought to arbitration earlier this month
after talks broke down between federal, state, and municipal
governments and Germany's two major public service trade unions,
DAG and OeTV.
</P>
<P>
DAG and OeTV rejected the employers' offer of a one percent
increase. They had been demanding a 4.5 percent pay rise and
organized strikes for higher wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
The strikes had disrupted public services such as transport,
garbage collection and health clinics across the country.

<HEADLINE> German BMW Confirms Bid for British Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bonn, March 25 (Xinhua) -- German carmaker BMW confirmed Friday
that it has bid for the British luxuxy carmaker Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Munich-based BMW said the bid was tabled
Wednesday, one day after German rival Volkswagen (VW) made an
offer.
</P>
<P>
Like VW, BMW did not disclose financial details of the bid.
</P>
<P>
British press reports said Rolls-Royce's parent company Vickers
engineering group wished to sell Rolls for at least 300 million pounds
(502 million U.S. dollars), compared to a value of 250 million pounds
(419 million dollars) estimated by bidders.
</P>
<P>
Crewe-based Rolls-Royce was put up for sale by Vickers earlier
this year. BMW, which makes the V12 engine for Rolls, is seen as
having a better chance than Europe's largest carmaker VW.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times reported that Kevin Morley, Rolls-Royce's
former director and a group of "Rolls-Royce enthusiasts" has also
joined the bidding, fearing the loss of the right to the brand
name Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
The name belongs to the Rolls-Royce aero-engine company, to which
the luxury carmaker was once a division. The aero-engine company's
contract of sale of the carmaker confirms its claim to the brand name,
in case of a takeover by foreign buyers.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan-Russia Strategic Partnership to Be Continued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALAM ATA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan has pledged to
continue improving relations with Russia during a forthcoming
visit by President Boris Yeltsin, despite the sacking of Russian
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Kazakh Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokaye said in an
interview with Kazakh newspaper Panorama published Friday that the
two countries were building a strategic partnership.
</P>
<P>
Tokaye said the reshuffle of Russian cabinet was an internal
affair, and hoped that the new Russian government would continue
talks with Kazakhtan.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Yeltsin sacked the whole Russian cabinet and named
former Energy Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, 35, as Acting Prime
Minister.
</P>
<P>
Tokaye said the forthcoming state visit by President Yeltsin to
Kazakhstan will mark a turning point in relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations were strained amid disagreements over the division of
the Caspian Sea, Russian debt to Kazakhstan, and tariffs following the
disintergration of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
But since January, the two nations have carried out a series of
negotiations, reaching agreements on their differences.

<HEADLINE> Mandela: I Won't Betray Friends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela reiterated Friday that he would not betray friends
who had helped the country in the apartheid era, such as Libya,
Iran and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference with visiting United States
President Bill Clinton, Mandela said he had high respect for
Clinton, but they were "not without differences" on some issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that South Africa had received heads of state from all
over the world, including Cuban President Fidel Castro, former
Iranian President Hojatoleslam Rafsanjani and Libyan leader
Muammar Gadaffi.
</P>
<P>
These people were South Africans' friends who had helped them
in the darkest days in South Africa's history by providing the
resources they needed to win, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to betray the trust of those who helped us,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations charter called upon all member
states to settle differences by means of negotiation and the
United States, a world superpower, should set an example for the
rest of the world in this regard.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons that the world highly appreciated South
Africa's success was that South Africans were able to sit down
with their enemies and talk about reconciliation, Mandela noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mandela and Clinton held one-on-one talks for more
than an hour, and then were joined by members of their respective
cabinets.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Cattle Threatened by Fatal Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A fatal cattle disease has
made an evil comeback in Tanzania, causing heavy deaths to herds,
agriculture experts said.
</P>
<P>
The disease, known as Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia
(CBPP), has killed more than 40,000 cattle in Tanzania over the
past eight years as it is spreading in east African countries.
</P>
<P>
The disease has affected 13 regions in Tanzania, said Peter
Msolla, Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the Sokoine University of
Agriculture (SUA), adding that Tanzania has been unable to
control the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanians eradicated the disease in 1967, but it has
resurfaced in the country since 1990, Msolla told a training
course Thursday at the university, based in the central Morogoro
Region.
</P>
<P>
CBPP, along with other cattle diseases, has posed dangers to
human health and threatened food security system in the country,
Msolla was quoted by The Guardian newspaper as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Other countries also affected by CBPP are Kenya, Rwanda,
Uganda, Burundi and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has a high population of cattle, ranking the third
after Sudan and Ethiopia in Africa.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Thursday groundbreaking ceremonies
for a foreign-funded race track in the Fuzhou Economic Development
Zone, Fujian Province, has marked the growing interest of overseas
investors in the local tourism projects.
</P>
<P>
The "Junshan Race Track" and "Junshan Jockey Club" will be part
of the province's first horse racing complex, according to local
sources.
</P>
<P>
The zone also inked contracts for foreign investments in 10
additional tourism projects valued at close to 84 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Fuzhou zone, located at the Minjiang River estuary,
functions as a high-tech industrial park, bonded zone, investment
zone for Taiwan investors and a pilot area for agricultural
cooperation across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The zone is home to 600-odd foreign-funded enterprises which
recorded a total 1997 industrial output value of 10 billion
yuan (1.2 billion US dollars). The said enterprises
exported products valued at over 500 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The zone's service industry has lagged behind and offers great
potential for extensive development of the tourism industry,"
according to Lei Chengcai, director of the zone's Administrative
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Mawei Port, located at the mouth of the river, is considered to
be the birthplace of the Chinese navy and the "cradle" for China's
shipbuilding industry. The development zone offers the nation's
shortest shipping route to Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
"Tourists from Taiwan can reach Fuzhou in only a few hours by
boat, with substantially less time required for air travel," said
Lei.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Fujian Province is the native home of numerous people
living in Taiwan, and the zone has employed various influential
businessmen from the island to consult on approaches for
attracting overseas investment for local tourism projects.
</P>
<P>
The zone also attempts to attract investments in an
additional 35 tourism projects valued at 250 million US dollars.

<P>
CAIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are the business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CASABLANCA -- The Moroccan "UNA" group at the Gerzi Island has
established a 100 million-dollar-fund for investments in the
Middle East and North Africa, naming it as "MENA Finance Ltd."
</P>
<P>
According reports reaching Cairo, shareholders of the Fund's
capital belong to private investors and financial and insurance
institutions in Morocco, the Gulf states and the United States.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Arab authority for investment and agricultural
development has expressed readiness to finance new Egyptian
agricultural projects to be submitted by the Cairo government,
particularly in the fields of edible oil production, export and
marketing of agricultural crops.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi-based authority had at a recent meeting in Dubai
expressed its appreciation of the progress in a sugar production
project at the Egyptian province of Fayoum, some 120 kilometers
south of Cairo. The authority contributes 17 percent of the some
60 million-dollar project with a production capacity of about
120,000 tonnes of sugar from sugar-beets a year.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The Saudi company of land transportation has
announced a 44 percent cut in its losses in 1997, reaching 1.1
million U.S. dollars as compared to a 1.94 million-dollar-loss in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The general manager of the company Youssef Mohamed Bakhsh has
attributed the decrease in losses to a cut in operational and
maintenance expenses and further control in expenses.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- The Kuwaiti shares index has somewhat improved over
the past week ending Wednesday on account of the rise in world oil
prices and the formation of a new cabinet. Likewise, the Kuwaiti
stock exchange market has gone up by 9.6 points during the week
ending Wednesday, closing at 2329.4 points.

formal talks with President Nelson Mandela in Cape Town on the
second day of his visit.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders will also hold a joint press conference in
Mandela's residence, before flying aboard the U.S. presidential
helicopter to Robben island, home to Mandela and other political
prisoners under apartheid.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral talks are expected to cover some contentious
issues, including South Africa's problems with Clinton's Africa
Trade Bill.
</P>
<P>
Clinton may also try to persuade Mandela to bring South Africa
into an international anti-corruption initiative, while Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo hinted Thursday that his government will not
bring up the American proposals for African Crisis Response
Initiative and for an African peace keeping force with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Nzo told reporters that such an initiative can only be
discussed by the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
Later in the evening, 750 guests will descend on the Verrest
Wine Estate for a state banquet in Clinton's honor.
</P>
<P>
Although there would be no formal presentation of South
Africa's highest honor to Clinton, Mandela would hand over the
Order of Good Hope privately to the U.S. President after the
banquet, a presidential spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On how Clinton would feel on accepting the award-- he will
share it with his arch foe Libyan leader Muammar Gathafi and
others -- White House spokesman Mike Meeurry said it had been
given to a range of individuals and "the President will accept it
in the spirit in which it is given."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived in Cape Town Thursday morning for a
Four-day state visit to South Africa, will leave the city
Saturday morning for Johannesburg where he will visit black
township of Soweto and meet young community and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
He will embark on the penultimate leg of his six-nation
African tour with a visit to Botswana Sunday.

<HEADLINE> IMF Accepts "Mexican Model" in Solving Debt Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has agreed to Indonesia's proposal to follow the "Mexican
pattern" in settling its private foreign debts.
</P>
<P>
IMF Director for Asia-Pacific Hubert Neiss said here Friday:
"We can accept the Mexican model with certain modifications in a
bid to settle the private sector foreign debts."
</P>
<P>
Neiss made the remarks before meeting the Indonesian team to
discuss how the private foreign debt problem will be settled.
</P>
<P>
Neiss, however, declined to give details.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican model means giving a grace period of three to four
years to the private sector to repay their debt and providing an
affordable exchange rate for the rupiah (national currency)
against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has been under severe pressure since July last year,
plunging to its lowest level of 17,000 to the greenback in
January, compared to 2,450 rupiah in the pre-crisis period in
July. It is trading at about 8,300 per dollar now.
</P>
<P>
This has caused most indebted companies to become technical
bankrupt as their foreign debts surpass their equity.
</P>
<P>
At the end of December last year, Indonesia's foreign debt
totaled to 137.424 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts held that the private sector's foreign debt is
one of the major causes of the monetary crisis in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team led by Neiss has been here since March 18 to
discuss economic reforms in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior justice official of the
Macao Government said on Friday that the Court of Final Appeal
should be established within 1998 so that it can gain experience
before the handover of power.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of Justice Jorge Silveira Justice made these remarks
while attending a seminar on the localization of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
"(We) hope that the Court of Final Appeal would be established
within 1998 so that it can operate for one year to gain the
necessary experience before the handover of power," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that several laws regarding the establishment of the
court had been drafted.
</P>
<P>
The consultation and study on the laws should be finished as
quickly as possible at the Macao Legislative Assembly, the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group, among others, so that the
laws can be promulgated in mid-1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Basic Law stipulates that the power of final
adjudication of the Macao Special Administrative Region shall be
vested in the Court of Final Appeal of the Region.
</P>
<P>
Silveira said a building will be constructed to house the Court
of Final Appeal and intermediate courts.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Produce Film on Yeti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Araniko Academy of Nepal
announced on Friday that it has decided to shoot a unique feature
film on Yeti, a mysterious biped roaming freely on the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
The work will begin in September and is expected to take about
two years, said Gulab Khetan, advisor to the academy, a
non-governmental organization in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The director will be a Nepalese, but a Western country will
provide technological support, he said.
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose the name of the country, saying that
some details remain to be decided.
</P>
<P>
Yeti has long been a subject of awesome expectations and highly
fanciful conjecture, but it is indeed not like the enigmatic Big
Foot supposed to be playing hide-and-seek with the local
inhabitants in North American wilds, the academy said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
Yeti is a reality experienced by many observers and occasional
mountaineers, and the film will take into account its objective
reality by furnishing details from legends, hearsay, supposed
encounters and other relative sources, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
It said scenes for the film will be shot at different locations
in Nepal like Mustang, Dhaulagiri, Lantang, Manaslu, Nupche, Gauri
Shankar and Ganesh Himal.
</P>
<P>
Besides the film, VCDs will also be produced for the
international audience, the press release added.

<HEADLINE> HK to Tighten Emission Standards for Diesel Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government said
Friday that it will introduce more stringent emission standards
for first registration of diesel private cars and light duty
vehicles in a bid to reduce the air pollution in the city.
</P>
<P>
Under an amended air pollution control regulation published
Friday, the government upgrades the current emission standards for
diesel vehicles of four tons and below, to come in line with the
latest European Union emission standards.
</P>
<P>
These new standards will reduce emissions of respirable
suspended particulates, and nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons from
individual diesel vehicles by 55 percent and 38 percent
respectively, a government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Similar stringent emission standards for diesel vehicles of
four tons and above had already been applied since April 1, 1997,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the new standards were so stringent that it would
in practice prevent future registration of diesel private cars in
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The new emission standards for private diesel cars will come
into effect on April 1, 1998 while those for light duty diesel
vehicles will be implemented on October 1, 1998.

<HEADLINE> HK's Development Strategy Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) has worked out a long-term
land-transport-environmental planning framework to enable Hong
Kong to continue to grow as a regional and international "City of
Vision."
</P>
<P>
According to a report available here Friday, the strategy has
also taken account of the development trends in South China,
especially in the Pearl River Delta.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Territorial Development Strategy Review
-- a Response to Change and Challenges," assumes four broad time
frames as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- The Short Term up to 2001: to focus on the speediest
possible implementation of individual projects already in the
pipeline, especially with regard to housing;
</P>
<P>
-- The Medium Term from 2001 to 2006: to accelerate the
detailed design and implementation of already planned larger-scale
land development and related infrastructure projects on a more
coordinated basis, as many of the land development projects are
required for housing;
</P>
<P>
-- The Long Term from 2006 to 2011: to promulgate and complete
as soon as possible a number of integrated planning and
development studies for additional strategic growth areas to
provide a framework for the subsequent implementation of priority
projects; and
</P>
<P>
-- An Extended Time Horizon beyond 2011: to set new strategic
development concepts in the context of future development
scenarios anticipated by the Commission on Strategic Development
of the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
In formulating the strategic development options, the report
pointed out, two broad regional development scenarios were
initially assumed, with the first scenario postulating that the
Pearl River Delta will be the major economic hinterland of Hong
Kong over the long term. The second scenario postulates that
Guangdong Province and other inner provinces of the mainland will
be the major economic hinterland of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the strategy, Secretary for Planning, Environment
and Land Bowen Leung Po-wing stressed on Thursday: "We can no
longer make plans in isolation." The experts and officials of both
the SAR and the mainland are working through various committees to
deal with a number of large-scale projects, he added.
</P>
<P>
The primary goal of the strategy is "to establish a broad,
long-term land use-transport-environmental planning framework
within which the necessary land and infrastructure can be
provided, having regard to resources availability," Leung said. It
is "to enable Hong Kong to continue to grow as a regional and
international 'City of Vision' and to maintain and enhance its
image as an attractive place in which to live and work, taking
account of development trends in South China, especially in the
Pearl River Delta."

<HEADLINE> HK to Enhance Role As Major Financial Center: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Financial Secretary of the Hong
 Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Donald Tsang Friday
stressed the need to enhance the SAR's role as a major financial
center in the world and defend the linked exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the "Asian Investment Conference," Tsang said that
the effect of the "Asian Contagion," or the recent financial
turmoil, on Hong Kong had been painful, but by no means critical,
nor chronic.
</P>
<P>
"We must maintain and enhance Hong Kong's role as a major
financial center in the region and internationally," he said. "We
are determined to defend the linked exchange rate system (between
the HK and U.S. dollars) at the present level of parity."
</P>
<P>
Tsang said the financial turmoil sweeping some East Asian
economies had given Hong Kong an opportunity to critically assess
its own "battle conditions."
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth may
slow down, but its a long history of fiscal discipline will help
the government "forge ahead with massive spending on
infrastructure, education and housing" despite the downturn.
</P>
<P>
Property prices in Hong Kong had now dropped to a more
realistic level, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's tourism is down, "but that has provided us with the
 impetus to seek out and develop new markets," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
The relatively high interest rates are expected to soften once
the financial turmoil in Asia calms down and "speculators finally
realize they cannot bet against the HK dollar and win," he
stressed.

<P>
In his address, Tsang gave his first-hand observations of a
review of the banking and stock market systems conducted recently
by the SAR government.
</P>
<P>
The review confirmed that Hong Kong's banking system was
generally well-regulated and banks well-managed.
</P>
<P>
"But we must not be complacent and will need to reinforce our
efforts to ensure banks pay special attention to the quality of
their assets to limit exposure in those areas affected by interest
rate volatility," the financial secretary said.
</P>
<P>
He said he was also satisfied with the regulatory framework of
the securities and futures markets.
</P>
<P>
With a view to reducing market volatility as well as providing
greater protection to investors and shareholders, Tsang said, he
was looking at areas such as derivative trading, notably index
futures and derivative warrants, as well as borrowing and
short-selling stocks.
</P>
<P>
He said the review report to be unveiled next month would
bolster the investing public's confidence in the financial and
securities markets.
</P>
<P>
Taking a more macro view of the Asian financial crisis, Tsang
observed that while Hong Kong was undeniably part of Asia, its
systems were different from those in other Asian economies and
"have protected us from contracting the full-blown financial flu
which has swept through the region."
</P>
<P>
"I think, if anything, Hong Kong represents a model of economic
management others in Asia are now realizing they should try to
follow: a free market under the rule of law; a clean government
which believes in prudent financial management and in not
directing the economy; a well-regulated and well-managed financial
sector; a reputation for playing by the rules; openness and
accountability," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 institutional investors and fund managers from
all over the world attended the three-day conference at the Hong
Kong Convention and Exhibition Center. The meeting, organized by
the Credit Suisse First Boston, opened on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Scientist Calls for Expanded Peaceful Use of Nuclear Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientist Yan Shuheng
said today that China needs to expand the peaceful use of nuclear
resources to ensure that its nuclear power industry reaches
advanced world levels.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power is the major component of the peaceful use of
nuclear resources, said Yan, secretary-general of the Chinese
Nuclear Society. Yan made the remarks during ceremonies marking
the conclusion of an international nuclear industry exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Development of the nuclear power industry is crucial for
coastal areas in south and east China which face shortages of
coal, oil and water resources, said Yan.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the country's coal mines are located in
north China, while more than 80 percent of the water resources
are found in southwest China. Energy shortages pose a major threat
in highly populated areas in eastern, southern and northeastern
China, home to the nation's major industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
The transportation of coal from north to south China currently
occupies over half of the nation's total railway capacity. Experts
say that additional nuclear power stations in south and east China
could significantly reduce the transportation burden.
</P>
<P>
China's nuclear power industry currently generates a mere 1.2
percent of the nation's total power output, a level substantially
lower than the worldwide average of 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power is highly reliable compared with any other energy
resources, said Yan, a scientist engaged in nuclear studies for 40
years.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power station features four protective layers,
including a one-meter thick concrete "safe layer" separating
radioactive matter from surrounding areas, according to Yan.
</P>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station of east China's Zhejiang
Province and the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station in south China's
Guangdong Province have operated safely since the early 1990s.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Reiterates Reconciliation Policy On KNU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 27 (Xinhua)-- The Myanmar government Friday
reiterated that it continues to hold out its "Olive Branch" to all
factions of the Kayin National Union (KNU) as it has done so
successfully with all other former insurgencies of the national
races.
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, a dozen anti-government ethnic armed
groups have surrendered to and made peace with the government.
However, the KNU, an anti-government ethnic armed group active on
the Myanmar-Thai border, has still refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
Armed men belonging to the Democratic Kayin Buddhist Army
(DKBA), a breakaway group of the KNU, attacked a Kayin refuge camp
on the Thai-Myanmar border three times this month, according to
Thai media sources.
</P>
<P>
An official information sheet Friday confirmed that a group of
30 armed men of the KNU last Tuesday attacked the War Hpot Kaw
village, 40 km inside Myanmar off the border, burning down 2
houses and wounding 3 villagers.
</P>
<P>
The recent incidents were merely interfactional conflicts
within the separatist KNU, the information sheet said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not the policy of the Myanmar Government to encourage
any factions of the KNU to violate the sovereignty of a
neighboring country," it said.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government is fully committed to maintaining good
and friendly relations with all countries in the world,
particularly with its neighbors, it stressed.

HONG KONG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains the third
largest in the world in terms of foreign currency reserves ranking
 in spite of a decline from January to February this year,
according to figures released by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority

</P>
<P>
Japan and China's inland areas rank top two in the world.

The official foreign currency assets were 96.7 billion
U.S. dollars at the end of February, which showed a 1.4 billion
U.S. dollar decline from the figure at the end of January.
</P>
<P>
The fall in foreign currency assets held in the Exchange Fund

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee Friday sought a vote of confidence in his
government in the just constituted lower house of parliament and
appealed for consensus to put an end to political instability in
the country.
</P>
<P>
As directed by President K. R. Narayanan last week, the
Vajpayee government would have to show its majority and obtain
confidence of the House within 10 days after its swearing-in on
March 19.
</P>
<P>
Moving a one-line motion, Vajpayee said he already had the
majority and would prove it.
</P>
<P>
In a 45-minute speech, Vajpayee urged all parties to come
together for tackling national issues. Political instability had
severely affected the country's economy and interests in the last
18 months, he said.
</P>
<P>
Voting on the motion is slated for Saturday after two days of
discussion and debates.
</P>
<P>
Initiating the debate on the confidence motion, Congress senior
leader and opposition leader of the House Sharad Pawar expressed
doubts about the stability plank of the ruling Bharatiya Janata
Party (BJP)-led coalition, saying that its vulnerability to
pressure from regional parties and groups was not a reassuring
signal for good governance.
</P>
<P>
The coalition was fraught with internal contradictions and the
BJP and its allies were having different perceptions on several
key issues and conflicting ambitions, analysts said. This renders
the ruling coalition incapable of providing a stable government,
Pawar said.

<HEADLINE> Duma Is Likely to Approve Kiriyenko's Nomination, Shokhin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma (the lower
house of parliament) is most likely to approve President Boris
Yelstin's nomination of Sergei Kiriyenko as the new prime minister,
Alexander Shokhin, leader of Our Home is Russia faction in the
Duma said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin named Kiriyenko as the prime minister
and asked the Duma to approve his nomination in the first debate
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, the Duma may be dissolved if it
rejects the candidate three times. But Shokhin held that the Duma
will move on the razor's edge and approve the candidate only at
the third try.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out the possibility that the left-wing
opposition will opt for early parliamentary elections and reject
the candidate three times.
</P>
<P>
Duma Speaker Gennady Seleznyov believes that Kiriyenko, as an
official candidate, should hold a series of meetings with the
lower house, not only faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
He notified that the Duma is likely to hold the first debate on
the candidacy on April 3.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Donors Dump Expired Drugs in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Many foreign donors are dumping
expired drugs in Uganda, a National Drug Authority (NDA) official
said.
</P>
<P>
Abaasi Kabogo, the Executive Secretary of NDA, reported to
annual Catholic Medical Bureau recently that every metric ton of
expired drugs transported to Uganda saves the donors an average
loss of 2,000 U.S. Dollars in their own countries, the Monitor
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
He appealed non-government agencies concerned to avoid such
ill-motivated donations and purchase drugs from reliable local
sources because the latter "is in line with the recommendations
of both the World Health Organization and the World Council of
Churches".
</P>
<P>
Most drugs in use in the country are donations. The sources of
drugs include private individuals, companies, NGOs, UN agencies,
UNOCEF and foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
The most evaluations have repeatedly shown that many of the
medical supplies were not appropriate ones, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Speaker Unapologetic in Mavhaire Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Speaker of Parliament
Cyril Ndebele Thursday refused to apologize over his recent
decision that the ruling Zanu (PF) party could not discipline a
parliament member for his utterances in parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a lengthy statement greeted by a hushed and attentive
almost full legislative assembly, Ndebele said the constitution
of Zimbabwe and the privileges, immunities and powers of
parliament act protect all utterances made in parliament or
committees of parliament, the Herald Daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Masvingo central Member of Parliament Dzikamayi Mavhaire, was
last week dismissed from the party's central committee and
suspended from holding any position in the ruling party for two
years following a statement which he made in parliament during
debate on constitutional reforms that President Robert Mugabe
"must go".
</P>
<P>
At the Zanu central committee meeting last Friday, Ndebele and
Mavhaire were rebuked by Mugabe, who said there was an open
rebellion against the ruling party by some top party leaders.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said these "evil schemers, conspirators, political
saboteurs" and their "misguided" ambitions were responsible for
the present situation of confusion and anxiety in the party, and
had to be "dealt with once and for all".
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, spokesman of party Nathan Shamuyarira
announced the speaker would be called to explain his decision.
</P>
<P>
"The matter is still under discussion by the disciplinary
committee which will report to the politburo and then to the
central committee."
</P>
<P>
The speaker Thursday said, "it is a privilege known to the law
that a member shall not be liable to any proceedings by reason of
anything which he may have said in parliament." He has reiterated
his loyalty to the party and Mugabe.

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Promote Stock Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The regionalization of stock
markets should become a major step towards sustainable economic
development in Africa, Chairman of the African Stock Exchanges
Association Apostle Alile has said.
</P>
<P>
Promoting regional stock markets is an important part among
African countries' joint efforts to forge stronger common ties
and foster economic integration in the continent, he was quoted
by Friday's Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
A regional bourse is helpful where countries encountered
difficulties in accessing external financing while revenue from
taxes remained low, he noted at a one-day seminar held here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The creation of regional stock exchanges was endorsed by the
African Capital Markets Forum and the Inter-governmental Group of
Experts at the Sixth conference of African finance ministers in
Ethiopia last year.
</P>
<P>
The planned east African stock market could promote rapid
growth in cross border trade in bonds and equities, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Such an arrangement will provide the respective markets in
the region with liquidity which may not be available at home
while investors will be reducing risks by spreading their
portfolios across national frontiers," said Alile.
</P>
<P>
He added that local companies can gain access to a much larger
pool of external funds by issuing securities in other markets in
east Africa, including Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"The regional stock market will address the problems of
liquidity, economies of scale and profitability of each stock
market in the sub-region," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there are problems which would need to be sorted out
before a regional stock exchange can take root, among them the
maintenance of minimum standards for clearing and settlement and
the establishment of a computerized clearing house, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In order for regional stock markets to be promoted, member
countries should harmonize their securities market laws, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Laws must be enacted to prohibit unsafe activities and to
protect investors from a false market. Unfriendly investment laws
such as exchange control measures should be abrogated while sound
economic policies must be adopted," he urged.
</P>
<P>
"Clear disclosure and information requirements and similar
accounting and auditing standards must be established to support
the promotion of a regional financial system," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Inspections of Iraqi Presidential Sites Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A group of 20 U.N. arms
inspectors and senior diplomats on Friday continued inspection of
the Iraqi presidential site -- Radwaniyah palace.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors and diplomats left for the southern suburb
of Baghdad where Radwaniyah palace locates in around 25 vans
from the Baghdad Monitoring and Certification Center, or the
Canal Hotel.
</P>
<P>
The inspection of Radwaniyah palace started Thursday, which
lasted about eight hours. Diplomatic sources said inspections went
on very smoothly and the Iraqi side had shown "astonishing
cooperation".
</P>
<P>
Charles Duelfer, an American, deputy chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM on dismantling Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction led the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz last month, Iraq
agrees to open its eight presidential sites previously off-limits
to inspections.
</P>
<P>
A special group of senior diplomats appointed by Annan and
arms experts from UNSCOM and the International Atomic Energy
Agency, headed by Sri Lankan Jayanatha Dhanapala, was assigned
to carry out the mission.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. map makers, all the eight Iraqi presidential
compounds cover an area of 31.5 square kilometers, including
10 square kilometers of water surface, which have been suspected
of hiding banned weapons of mass destruction and their programs.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM Chairman Richard Butler told a press conference in
Baghdad on Sunday there are 1,058 buildings in the eight
presidential compounds.

<P>
CHENGDU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Science Commission in
southwest China's Sichuan Province has launched a new irrigation
project to ensure the efficient use of water in dry hilly areas.
</P>
<P>
The project, considered to be a fundamental approach for
solving problems associated with problem, is expected to yield
substantial benefits over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Commission director Yang Guo'an said a contingent of 60-odd
agricultural experts will work on the project to be carried out at
a cost of three million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yao said the project will ensure efficient irrigation on
between 80-90 percent of experimental fields.

<P>
Experts point to the importance and necessity for introducing
efficient irrigation system in Sichuan, one of the nation's most
densely populated provinces.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources note that the effective use of Sichuan's
irrigation resources stands at a mere 40 percent. They also note
that the low grain yields on 70 percent of China's farm land can
be attributed to water shortage.

fossilized remains of the famous Confucius Bird.
</P>
<P>
The hall's six sections, which include exhibitions of
dinosaurs, marine animals and the history of geology, trace the
evolution of lower animals.
</P>
<P>
One exhibit area, which covers 600 sq.m. and features
cobblestones and artifical rockery rather than glass cabinets,
provides visitors with a clear and unobstructed view of items on
display, according to the curator.
</P>
<P>
The museum plans to offer new exhibits every six months and
visitors will be allowed to join in scientific demonstrations. The
curator noted that related "activities will spark the curiosity
and interest of children and will greatly enhance learning in the
area of science."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Eurobonds Succeeds in International Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has succeeded in an
unprecedented borrowing drive as its Eurobonds issues are welcomed
in the international markets, the Daily Star newspaper said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese, Arab, and Western investors are rushing to buy the
country's two Eurobonds issues worth of 800 million U.S. dollars,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government is selling 300 million dollars five-year
and 500 million dollars three-year bonds through Paribas, a
French bank. Together they make for the Arab world's largest
issue.
</P>
<P>
Paribas is marketing the bonds through "roadshow," a series
of presentations that move from country to country. They
explain the appeal of the bonds, and compare them to other
investments in the region.
</P>
<P>
The roadshow kicked off in the Switzerland on Thursday, it
proceeds to the United Kingdom Friday and moves on the Bahrain
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A Lebanese central bank official said the Finance Ministry
and the bank may consider raising the Eurobonds to 1 billion
U.S. dollars as the roadshow in Europe proved to be such a
success.
</P>
<P>
The two offerings, which will bring to nearly 2 billion
dollars, the amount the government has raised in Eurobonds
since 1994, aims at offsetting part of the country's huge
internal debt in Lebanese pound by the foreign currency which
averagely carries an interest rate of about 9 percent, less
than half the domestic borrowing.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's public debt was closing at 15 billion dollars in
January this year, of which only 2.4 billion dollars was
external.
</P>
<P>
The government also intends, through outside borrowing, to
bring under control the ballooning budget deficit that reached
18 percent of the Gross Domestic Product last year.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's ability to tap international markets has been in
question after international rating agencies, such as Standard &AMP;
Poor, warned of a possible downgrade if Lebanese government
failed to bring down the deficit.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Austrian painter Max Weiler's
exhibition on display in the China Art Gallery shows vivid and
unique landscapes to the Chinese and adds bright color to cultural
contacts between China and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen and Austrian Vice-Chancellor
and Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel attended the opening
ceremony on March 10. The exhibition was part of the "98 China
Year of International Fine Arts" series.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel noted that the exhibition will help to bridge
understanding between the two countries and contribute to
Sino-Austrian cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He noted that future exhibitions and concerts are now under
consideration.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 people visited the exhibition every day. They
praised the charm of Weiler's works.
</P>
<P>
Weiler, 88, has long cherished the idea of exhibiting his works
in China, The Austrian painter identifies himself with principles
in Chinese landscape paintings dating to the Song Dynasty
(960-1279).
</P>
<P>
The artist integrates Chinese styles with modern European
abstract art to create stylish paintings.
</P>
<P>
Health problems prevented Weiler from attending the opening
ceremony. However, a personal diary notation explains that his
creativity is a spiritual one that sparks disquieting thoughts and
such thoughts surge from the vast stretches of China to the
mountains of his hometown.
</P>
<P>
China's Central Nationalities Orchestra (CNO) presented the
charm of Chinese music in the "Golden Hall" of Vienna on the eve
of the Year of the Tiger.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent a congratulatory message

<HEADLINE> China Developing Nuclear Power To Protect Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- China has started work on four
large nuclear power stations, which are expected to increase the
proportion of power coming from nuclear power and to reduce
pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in Zhejiang Province, Ling'ao
in Guangdong, and Lianyungang in Jiangsu will have a total
generating capacity of 6.7 million kilowatts, or about half that
of the Three Gorges Project. They will need more than 10 billion
US dollars, he said, and will help raise the proportion of nuclear
power from the current one percent to four or five percent of the
country's total, says Yan Shuheng, secretary-general of the
Chinese Nuclear Society.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power stations require less fuel and produce little
wastes, compared with coal-fired plants, with one
million-kilowatts capacity coal-fired plant consuming about three
million tons of coal each year, and release six million tons of
carbon dioxide, four to five tons of sulfur dioxide, and 300,000
tons of cinder each year.
</P>
<P>
A nuclear power station with similar capacity only needs 30
tons of fuel a year and discharges no carbon dioxide, sulfur
dioxide or other waste gas.
</P>
<P>
China is the biggest coal consumer in the world, using more
than one billion tons year. Estimates are that it produces over 20
million tons of sulfur dioxide each year, and 30 percent of the
country's land has suffered from acid rain.
</P>
<P>
The large amount of carbon dioxide from burning coal can also
affect the environment and international organizations have urged
countries to increase control on carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear power stations currently supply 17 percent of the
world's electric power, meaning not discharging 2.3 billion tons
of carbon dioxide from coal each year, they said. Carbon dioxide
emissions would increase by 10 percent if the nuclear power plants
are not used.

<HEADLINE> Australia Stocks Close Lower As BHP, Rate Hopes Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A fall in resources giant BHP
shares after a lower-than-expected quarterly result and fading
hopes for an interest rate cut combined to drive the Australian
share market lower Friday.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index fell 18.4 points to 2,762.7 as the
above factors countered a strong rise in gold stocks on the back
of a firming bullion price.
</P>
<P>
Interest rate-sensitive stocks like banking and retailing
stocks in particular were sold off after comments by Reserve Bank
of Australia Governor Ian Macfarlane implied on Thursday that
rates were on hold for now.
</P>
<P>
"Ian Macfarlane's comments really didn't give us any thought of
a rate cut when the market fairly well expected one, and that was
one of the reasons (the market was down)," Stuart Smith from
Henderson Charlton Jones said.
</P>
<P>
"The main reason is the options expiry, with most of the volume
going through today, taking money out of the market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index fell 5.5 points to 1,183.9 as BHP
slumped 35 cents to 15.65 Australian dollars after reporting a 67
percent fall in third quarter net profit to 83 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The result was below analysts' expectations, and when it was
released it weighed on the market with the resources company
topped turnover with more than 32 million BHP shares exchanged.
</P>
<P>
Global miner Rio Tinto fell six cents to 19.54 Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The gold index jumped 35 points, or 3.07 percent, to 1,176.7 as
the bullion price rose 2.35 U.S. dollars per ounce to 301.25
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index fell 34.1 points to 4,740.9, with
telecommunications giant Telstra bucking the trend of the major
stocks to rise another five cents to 3.89 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the major banks, Westpac continued its recent falls with
a 23-cent drop to 10.14 Australian dollars, ANZ was down at 10.35
Australian dollars, National Australia Bank was down 24 cents at
21.74 Australian dollars and Commonwealth closed 25 cents lower at
18.07 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover for Friday was 383.9 million shares worth
1.116 billion U.S. dollars, with falls outnumbering rises by 580
to 481.

<HEADLINE> Ross in Israel to Begin New Round of Mediation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Deniss Ross arrived here Thursday night to begin another round of
shuttle diplomacy on salvaging the stalled peace process, more
important to sell the U.S. proposal to Israel on troops pullout
from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative mainly focus on the Israeli troop
redeployment in the West Bank, in which the U.S. persuades the
Israeli government to hand over around 13 percent territory to
the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the next redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Handing over more territories to the PNA remains one of the
biggest unsettled issues hindering the Israeli-Palestinian peace
talks. The Israeli government so far has not reached any decision
on the percentage of redeployment, saying that every one percent
territory in the West Bank is critical to Israel security.
</P>
<P>
The current Israeli government has been implementing a hardline
policy in the peace process and the majority within the coalition
oppose handing over any more land to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
In order to save the peace process from total failure, the
U.S. Administration formulated several weeks ago this 13 percent
redeployment proposal and threatened to unveil it without the
endorsement from Israel.
</P>
<P>
This move of the U.S. caught Israel off guard, but the Israeli
government immediately announced its rejection to the proposal,
saying that the U.S. can raise this and that suggestion, but
only Israel can make decisions about its security needs.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Banjamin Netanyahu started his meeting
here Friday morning with Ross to discuss the U.S. proposal, but he
stated on the eve of the meeting that he "can not accept a
diktat," adding that Israel has its own principles.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's communication advisor David Bar-illan also said
Thursday night that it would be utterly impossible for Israel to
withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank for
security reasons.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel may agree to a two-digit pullback
and the exact figure is less than the U.S. proposed, and the areas
to be handed over to the PNA would be "contiguous rather than
scattered pockmarks" among which travel would be difficult and
hazardous for the Israeli settlers.
</P>
<P>
On the redeployment issue, the PNA has adopted a totally
different attitude. PNA chairman Yasser Arafat is reportedly to
demand a three-phased sizable Israeli pullbacks and a freeze in
Israel's settlement activities in the West Bank in his meeting
with Ross scheduled Friday evening in Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is also expected to press Ross to divulge details of the
U.S. 13 percent proposal to be carried out over 12 weeks. Arafat
has also hinted that the PNA would only agree to the figure
provided Israel implemented another pullback afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's meeting with Ross was postponed until friday after
a delay in Ross's arrival Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the PNA also rejected the Israeli suggestion to
offer territorial contiguity, probably to link up the towns of
Jenin and Nablus and perhaps even Ramallah at the north end of
the West Bank and Hebron with surrounding towns in the south.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, viewing the strong rejections from the Israeli side
and the demands from the PNA, it will be hard for Ross to
accomplish his mission and unveil the U.S. initiative during his
current trip to the region.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Nominates Kiriyenko as Russian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said Friday that he has nominated acting Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko as premier, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, speaking to reporters after meeting with Kiriyenko,
also hoped that the State Duma (the lower house of parliament)
would approve his nomination.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian constitution, if the State Duma fails to
approve his three nominations, the president has the right to
disband the Duma and call for new parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko, 35, once Energy Minister, was appointed acting prime
minister after Yeltsin sacked Viktor Chernomyrdin and the whole
government on March 23.
</P>
<P>

Nelson said that prisoners should work, and that labor should
not be seen simply as a kind of punishment. It can help inmates
earn a living since they can learn certain working skills through
labor, she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the fact that prisoners can work together make jails
in China more like a community, which can help them avoid
psychological problems associated with long-term isolation,
something that is seen quite often in American jails, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
Nelson has had more exchanges with Chinese counterparts in the
1990s and has been following the development of China's legal
system closely and says that has been encouraging.
</P>
<P>
She said she is concerned about China's new Criminal Code, but
that the principle of innocent until proven guilty under the law
in the new code is major progress in China's legal system. This
effectively eliminates the biases of judges in the conviction and
punishment phases, she said.
</P>
<P>
But, China has a lot to do in working toward the goal of "rule
by law", educating the citizens, especially youngsters, better
about the law.
</P>
<P>
There are also flaws in the American legal system, she said,
pointing to the sensational trial of O.J. Simpson that made people
skeptical about the justice in American courts.
</P>
<P>
She concluded the United States and China should understand and
learn from each other in the field of law.

<HEADLINE> 700 Turkish Rebels Join in Iraqi Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 former members of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) of Turkey have
surrendered to a major Northern Iraqi party, Western diplomatic
sources said.
</P>
<P>
These former PKK militants are now joining the Kurdistan
Democratic Party (KDP) forces in the battle against their
former comrades, the Daily News newspaper quoted the sources as
saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
"They are reported to be fighting better than the KDP members,"
they said, failing to tell when and where they crossed over to
the KDP, which is fighting against the PKK and the pro-Iranian
Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) troops in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported earlier that Semdin Sakik, former
commander of the PKK forces, had surrendered himself to the
KDP and might be extradited to the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, both Turkey and the pro-Ankara KDP denied the
reports, saying that there is no plan for the extradition of
the former PKK military chief.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting the Turkish government since 1984
for the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in eastern
and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
For Wiping out the outlawed PKK guerrillas operating in
northern Iraq, Turkey has repeatedly launched cross-border
military offensives to strike the PKK camps in northern Iraq,
prompting strong criticism from the international community.

<HEADLINE> Australian Firm Gets Severe Fine for Price-fixing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- An Australian national trucking
company was fined 2.51 million U.S. dollars Friday for its
"illegal conduct" in asking competitors not to undercut its
freight charges.
</P>
<P>
Justice Peter Heerey, in the Victorian Supreme Court in
Melbourne, imposed the penalty a month after handing down his
decision over the case brought by the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission (ACCC) against the company of J McPhee and Son
(Australia), the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Four executives of the company were fined between 67,000 U.S.
dollars and 10,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Outside the court, a spokesman for the company said an appeal
to the full bench of the Supreme Court would be lodged against the
judgment and fines.
</P>
<P>
Justice Heerey said that by setting penalties at such a level
the court intended to deter any conduct which is considered "very
damaging" to the Australian community.
</P>
<P>
The judge ruled last month that McPhee had flouted trade
regulations by asking one of its main competitors, Discount
Freight Express (DFE), to "cover" quotes to customers - Just Jeans
and ACI Florapak.
</P>
<P>
The demand was aimed at staving off a threat from rival company
IPEC. This meant that the quotes would not be less than the prices
charged by McPhee.
</P>
<P>
The judge said that members of the McPhee management arranged a
meeting in May 1995 for the purpose of persuading the DFE
Victorian management to put in a cover quote.
</P>
<P>
John McPhee, chairman of McPhee, said in a statement Friday
that "all of us at McPhee Transport are devastated by the court's
judgment and will be strenuously pursuing an appeal to clear the
name of the company and the executives named in the case."

MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
signed the 1998 federal budget Friday, which has been approved by
the State Duma and the Federal Council (two houses of parliament)
earlier this month, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The budget sets 1998 government spending at 499.9 billion
rubles (about 83.3 billion U.S. dollars) and revenues at 367.5
billion rubles (about 61.2 billion dollars). The maximum budget
deficit may be 132.3 billion rubles (about 22 billion dollars) or
4.7 percent of the country's GDP.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told acting Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, who has
been nominated as premier, to guarantee quarterly report of the
cabinet on the execution of the budget from the beginning of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said Thursday that he would draft the government's

BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua)-- Vanessa-Mae, who despite her young
age has been compared with maestros such as Menuhin, Heifetz and
Kreisler, will perform two concerts in Beijing's Capital Stadium

<P>
The "true child prodigy like Mozart and Mendelssohn" was the

violin by the age of 13.

Vanessa-Mae is not only steeped in the classical discipline ,
but also introduces both acoustic and electric violins in a unique
techo-acoustic fusion considered to be a hybrid of many musical
genres.
</P>
<P>
Some consider her style to be a violation of the classics,
while others applaud her for creating "magic."
</P>
<P>
Vanessa-Mae, 20, completed a violin course at the China Central
conservatory of Music. Her repertoire for the April performances
will include Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, Butterfly Lovers and

<P>
WELLINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's balance of
payments deficit in the year to December 1997 hit a record high of
7.5 billion New Zealand dollars (4.2 billion U.S. dollars),
Television New Zealand reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The figure means that New Zealand spent 7.5 billion New Zealand
dollars overseas more than it earned in the year. The deficit
amounted to 7.7 percent of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
The deficit occurred at a time when New Zealand experienced a
continuing decline in trade balance as imports were rising faster
than exports.
</P>
<P>
The balance of payments deficit is tipped to grow further as
the full impact of the Asian currency crisis is beginning to bite,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The money market responded to the news with a quick rise in
short-term interest rates. The key 90-day bank bills rate climbed
to 9.57 percent Friday, signaling a new round of mortgage rates
hike on the way.

<HEADLINE> American Judge Comments On China's Legal System (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A judge of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, Dorothy Nelson, says she sees many "positive
factors" in China's judiciary after getting a first-hand look at
Chinese courts and prisons.
</P>
<P>
Nelson, who is making her third visit to China, praised the
practise of mediation, education for those who commit minor
crimes, and proper physical labor for prisoners.
</P>
<P>
She told Xinhua that she has been interested in China's legal
system since 1979, when she was appointed to the bench by
President Jimmy Carter and the United States established
diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
She first came to China in October of 1989, at a time when the
western media were very critical of China. The mediation system
has settled a large number of civil and minor criminal cases
without bringing them to the court. This has not only lightened
the burden on the judges and litigants, but also helped maintain
the harmony of human relationships and social stability, she said.
</P>
<P>
One example she gave was a couple going to court to try to
settle problems in their marriage, where mediation may give them a
new start while a verdict would put an end to the marriage, and
the latter is often the case in the United States, Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese judiciary emphasizes education more than punishment
in the case of minor crimes, something that can prevent many
teenagers from going on to commit more serious crimes, she said.
But in the US, minor crimes committed by teens can burden them
with a bad record, something that may have a negative effect for
their entire lives.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish military intelligence has
accused Iran and Greece of supporting Kurdish rebels of Turkey, a
leading Turkish newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The military intelligence sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, were quoted by Daily News as saying that the two
neighboring countries of Turkey have joined hands in providing
support to the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) since
January.
</P>
<P>
The PKK militants were first trained in Greece and then
flown to Iran from where they will infiltrate into Turkey and
northern Iraq, sources said.
</P>
<P>
Three Greek officers are now providing military training,
including the use of heavy artillery, to the PKK members in the
Rzayi camp, which is the second largest one of its kind in Iran,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 11 camps scattered in Iran where the PKK
militants receive military instructions, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been accusing Greece and Iran of rendering financial
and military support to the PKK which has been engaging Ankara for
the Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Iran, which both share bitter relationship with
Turkey, categorically denied the accusations, saying that this
charge is mere propaganda of Ankara.

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei Province
is seeking financial support for a project to refurbish an ancient
local temple built over 1,000 years ago.
</P>

<P>
The two-year project will cost an estimated 32 million yuan,
with the funding coming from the central and regional governments,
as well as from individuals.

short of expectations," according to Zhang Xiusheng, director of
the the project which commenced in last April. He expressed the
hope that businesses and individuals from both at home and abroad
will offer a helping hand.
</P>
<P>
The Longxing Temple, located in Hebei's Zhengding County, was
constructed in the year 971. The temple houses a 21.3 meter high
bronze buddha considered to the largest piece of its kind
fashioned during the period.
</P>
<P>
The building has been refurbished several times, with the last
renovation effort completed in 1944. Experts note that several
small halls were demolished during the last renovation. The
renovation also greatly altered the original appearance of the
temple.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government will
provide a fund of one billion U.S. dollars to the country's
commercial banks for smoothing export without the letters of
credit.
</P>
<P>
The fund will come from loans by the World Bank and other
international institutions, said the Commerce, Industry and Trade
Minister Park Tae-young Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The devaluation of the Korean won against the greenback has
given exporters good opportunities, but actual shipment has not
been as impressive as expected due to the financial and foreign
exchange crisis," said Park.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that his ministry will consider
restoration of the trade financing system, which suspended in 1989
for affiliates of the country's top conglomerates, or chaebols, to
help their export and import business.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the government allocated three billion
dollars to assist businesses import much-needed raw materials amid
fear of troubles of export industries suffering from the financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans
of financials institutions late last year.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which is still in the financial crisis, has been
working hard for getting more foreign currency by increasing
export and reducing import since it signed an agreement with the
International Monetary Fund last December for a bailout fund of 57
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Credit Cards Becoming More Popular In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A "Gold Card Program" that was
tried out in China's commercial and financial center, Shanghai,
has proven effective in increasing the use of credit cards.
</P>
<P>
The city has set up China's largest urban interbank credit card
network with more than 10 financial institutions like the
Industrial and Commercial Bank, Agriculture Bank, Bank of China,
Investment Bank, Pudong Development Bank, and Shanghai City
Cooperative Bank.
</P>
<P>
The program's slogan "One card means cash in any bank" is
gaining currency in the city as credit cards from each of the
network's banks, as well as post office Green Cards, can be used
at all ATMs and point-of-sales (POS) computer terminals to get
cash, information, or gain access to an account.
</P>
<P>
Since the program's start in 1994, Shanghai has issued over
eight million credit cards and opened 1,700 ATMs and 4,500
POS computer cash registers.
</P>
<P>
More than four million business transactions, worth three
billion yuan, were handled by ATMs last year, a 282 percent
increase from the previous year. POS outlets handled 252,000 deals
in 1997 worth, 158 million yuan, a 541 percent increase from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is making an effort to give greater accessibility to
credit cards by making standards and business procedures closer to
international practices. It got its credit card network connected
to VISA International's ATM network in 206 countries and regions
by last June so that VISA Card owners can get renminbi from
ATMs in Shanghai. By the end of last year, 1.32 million
U.S. dollars worth of business had been done in this way.
</P>
<P>
An "intelligent" credit card is getting more use for paying for
taxi rides, shuttle bus fares, and taxes. Non-banking institutions
have issued over one million such cards.

<HEADLINE> Drought Reduces Kenya's Tea Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan tea exports fell from
1996's 257 million kilograms to 221 million last year due to
severe drought in the first three months of 1997, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tea exports earned Kenya 366 million U.S. Dollars in foreign
exchange last year compared to 420 million dollars in 1996, a
drop of approximately 14 percent, said the Kenya Tea Growers
Association.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the reduced exports, we expect a bumper harvest this
year as there was continuous rain resulting from the El Nino
weather phenomenon from mid-October last year through to January
this year," said the body in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Besides last year's drought, Kenya's tea industry has also
been hit by constant wrangles between individual tea growers and
the Kenya Tea Development Authority, a management supervisory
body of Kenya farmers. The row culminated in a week-long strike
last month.
</P>
<P>
The strike came at the same time as a total work stoppage in
Sri Lanka's tea industry over wages, which dragged on through
February.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are the world's largest tea producers, with
Sri Lanka producing a record 277 million kgs of tea last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Supports Certification of Mexico in Drug War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate voted 54 to 45
Thursday night to uphold President Bill Clinton's endorsement of
Mexico as a reliable ally in the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1961 law, U.S. presidents must certify to Congress
annually that drug-producing countries have "cooperated fully" with
the U.S. on drug-control efforts. Congress then has 30 days to
overturn such a designation.
</P>
<P>
The vote rejected a resolution proposed by senators Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., that would have
overturned Clinton's March certification.
</P>
<P>
In this year's drug control report, Clinton certified Mexico as
being "fully cooperative."
</P>
<P>
However, Feinstein told the Senate that Mexico had cooperated
on the political level with the United States but not at the law
enforcement level.
</P>
<P>
She compared Mexico's drug control efforts to "an inflated
balloon; impressive to look at but hollow at the core and easily
punctured."
</P>
<P>
Opponents said decertification would be counter productive with
a country that shares a long border with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The annual certification process was criticized by countries
that are under investigation. They said this is interference in
their domestic affairs.

present in the House on 27 and 28 March and to vote in favor of
the confidence motion which is to be moved by Prime Minister
Vajpayee on Friday. The BJP has also requested all of its allies
to issue a similar whip to their respective members to ensure
victory in the trial of strength.
</P>
<P>
The BJP and its allies held a meeting Thursday evening to
discuss the joint strategy to be adopted by them during discussion
on the confidence motion. They would again be meeting Friday
morning before the commencement of the House sitting to coordinate
cooperation among various constituents of the government.
</P>
<P>
On paper, the government side has a wafer thin majority in a
House with an effective strength of 539 already elected MPs. The
ruling party and its allies have a strength of 264, while the
opposition parties including the Congress and the United Front
have 261 MPs.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders of Telugu Desam Party (TDP), National Conference
and Asom Gana Parishad, who recently parted ways with the United
Front, met on Wednesday and ruled out support to Congress-led
government. The three parties have 14 MPs in the House.
</P>
<P>
TDP sources said its strategy on the confidence motion would be
decided on the floor of the House including a possible last-minute
oral whip in favor of the government.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, opposition parties are bracing themselves up
for a combined onslaught on the multi-party BJP-led government
during the trial of confidence. The Congress has issued a
three-line whip to its members in the House to oppose the motion
of confidence. Other opposition parties are also expected to issue
the similar whips to their members.

<HEADLINE> Thai Invigilators Warned of Hi-Tech Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Invigilators in Thailand have
been ordered to keep an eye on cheatings using advanced
technologies such as Internet during this year's university
entrance examinations, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Officials must be prepared for all kinds of tricks, the
University Affairs Ministry's Anti-cheating Committee warned.
</P>
<P>
Above all, there is the hi-tech cheating device in which
cheating gangs use the Internet to directly transmit answers
through pagers.
</P>
<P>
This method will bypass pager operators and some pagers are as
small as matchboxes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the cheating, invigilators are expected to conduct
a body search on students to find these devices and other
receivers.
</P>
<P>
An anti-cheating committee official predicted that there will
be widespread cheating in this year's university entrance exams in
Thailand since many secondary school students want places at
state-run universities.
</P>
<P>
About 190,000 students have applied for state-run universities
this year, but the universities are able to accommodate only
27,000.
</P>
<P>
Anti-cheating groups have been asked to keep a close watch on
April 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12 when students are tested in difficult
subjects such as English, maths and science.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has sought help from the Post and Telegraph
Department to send mobile radio trucks to scan frequencies used in
the cheating and scramble the signals.
</P>
<P>
Three mobile radio trucks will be placed in Bangkok's
examination venues and six others in the provinces.

<HEADLINE> Further Reform Needed for Thai Economy: UK Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Thailand needs further reform to
regain sustainable growth despite its achievement in rebuilding
confidence in the economy, visiting British Economic Secretary to
the Treasury Helen Liddel said.
</P>
<P>
Liddel, who heads a team of British bankers and financiers on a
two-day visit here, held talks with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai,
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda and other cabinet ministers
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post reported Friday that Liddel suggested Thailand
 undertake an "orderly" privatization of state enterprises, as it
is crucial for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
While European nations did not want to see a "fire sale" of
assets, Thailand needed to set up credible regulations, reforms
and accounting systems, she said.
</P>
<P>
"This will lead to important efficiency gains in the Thai
economy, as well as significant proceeds which could be used in
recapitalizing the financial sector," she said.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which has undergone significant privatization of state
agencies and utilities over the past decade, was prepared to lend
technical assistance and advice to Thailand, Liddel added.
</P>
<P>
Britain will host the second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM)
scheduled next week in London. It has proposed establishing an
ASEM trust fund to help provide technical assistance and advice to
Asian countries battered by the regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Liddel said Britain is prepared to contribute 5 million pound
(8.3 million U.S. dollars) to the fund, as well as lend technical
assistance to Thailand and other Asian countries to establish
social safety nets and proceed with privatization and structural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Britain is also expected to lend financial aid to Thailand
through the International Monetary Fund if necessary, she said.
</P>
<P>
A roundtable discussion at the ASEM would focus mainly on the
Asian currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Liddel said European leaders would have a chance to listen to
the problems and learn lessons about the current economic problems
from their Asian counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Holds Military Parade for Armed Forces Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Friday held a grand
military parade, participated by more than 5,000 military men and
members of the Police Force, the Fire Brigade and the Red Cross,
to mark the 53rd anniversary of the Armed Forces Day or Resistance
Day.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, attended by Myanmar leaders, high
officials, military officers and foreign military attaches,
Commander-in-Chief of the Myanmar Defense Services Senior-General
Than Shwe urged the armed forces to endeavor "for emergence of a
peaceful, modern and developed nation and discipline-flourishing
democracy in cooperation with the people."
</P>
<P>
On national reconciliation, Than Shwe, who is also chairman of
the State Peace and Development Council and prime minister, said,
"I would like to state here that our Tatmadaw (defense forces) is
extending the olive branch and keeping the door open for the
remnants."
</P>
<P>
Since the late 1980s, a dozen anti-government ethnic armed
groups have returned to the legal fold and made peace with the
government. However, Kayin National Union (KNU), an
anti-government ethnic armed group on the Myanmar-Thai border,
still has not done so.
</P>
<P>
On foreign policy, Than Shwe stated that Myanmar is adhering to
an independent and active foreign policy based on peaceful
coexistence.
</P>
<P>
"Today, Myanmar stands as an ASEAN member and works for mutual
interest with other ASEAN nations on regional issues and for
national development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Myanmar has also been able to enhance good bilateral relations
and improve friendly ties with all her neighbors," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM to Seek Europe's Help at ASEM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai
is expected to convince Europe at the Second Asia-Europe Meeting
(ASEM) next month to take concrete measures to restore Thai
economic stability, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Bangkok Post Friday quoted the spokesman, Kobsak Chutikul,
as saying Thailand is going to maximize the ASEM summit for the
national agenda of confidence-building.
</P>
<P>
The most urgent task of Chuan's trip to London, the venue of
the ASEM meeting, is to convince European countries to roll over
and restructure corporate debts and provide export credits for
Thai exporters to ensure their cash-flow necessary for operation,
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union provided 1.5 billion U.S. dollars of export
credits to Indonesia, Thailand and South Korea in 1997. But this
year soft loans should be increased, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
Chuan will also call on European countries to open their
markets or facilitate market access for Thai products, he said.
</P>
<P>
Recapitalization for Thai financial institutions is another
topic Chuan will cover.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Chuan will explain what steps have been taken
to restore confidence of European investors including a legal
process for the bankruptcy law and alien business law," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will also brief the meeting on the situation
of small and medium enterprises and political and bureaucracy
reforms, he added.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Hopes for Peaceful Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Bulgarian Foreign
Minister Nadezhda Mikhailova said here on Thursday that her
country is willing to work with other countries to help avoid any
fallout from the ethnic tensions in Kosovo, a province of
Yugoslavia's Serbia Republic.
</P>
<P>
Tensions in Kosovo escalated on March 1 when four Serb
policemen and 16 ethnic Albanian separatists were killed in an
armed conflict, according to earlier reports by the Yugoslavian
news agency Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, which borders Yugoslavia, fears the violence between
the Serbian authorities and ethnic Albanians might spread beyond
Kosovo. Neighboring Albania and Macedonia both have large ethnic
Albanian populations.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova, arriving here for a two-day visit beginning
Thursday from a meeting with the six-nation Contact Group in Bonn,
said further sanctions against Yugoslavia should be made in a
step-by-step manner without inflicting harms to its neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group, which comprises Russia, Germany, Britain,
the United States, France and Italy, on Wednesday gave Belgrade
four weeks to end the violence in Kosovo, where Albanians
outnumber Serbs by nine to one, or face additional sanctions.
</P>
<P>
During her stay here, Mikhailova discussed the Kosovo crisis
and bilateral trade with her Finnish counterpart Tarja
Halonen. She also met Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Prime
Minister Paavo Lipponen.

BUENOS AIRES, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Carlos
Menem on Thursday condemned a Tuesday attack against a government
army's unit stationed in the south.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a statement that he will not allow this
serious incident, which he called "savage," to pass without being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
The attack occurred in the southern province of Neuquen, where
more than 15,000 demonstrators threw rocks against barracks of the
Sixth Mountain Brigade stationed there.
</P>
<P>
Menem deplored the material and moral damage inflicted by the
incident and asked the people to meditate profoundly on the causes
of these attacks.
</P>
<P>
A military coup occurred on March 24, 1976, which started a
period of military dictatorship in the country. The political
repression that resulted saw the sudden and
mysterious 'disappearance' of thousands of people.

The demonstration was organized to commemorate that period of

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The gas pipeline that will
eventually connect the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires with
Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, will be under construction by
October.
</P>
<P>
A consortium formed by a British gas company and an
Argentina-U.S. joint venture won the construction bid Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 215-kilometer Buenos Aires-Montevideo 'gasoduct,' also
called "Gasoducto del Sur," will be completed by the end of 1999
and commence operations on the first day of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
It will initially transport two million cubic meters of natural
gas a day from Argentina to the southern provinces of Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The supply will eventually be increased to five million cubic
meters a day, as Uruguayan domestic needs increase.
</P>
<P>
The southern part of Uruguay, with 1.5 million inhabitants,
almost half of the country's total population, is the most
industrial and commercial zone of the country.
</P>
<P>
The gasoduct will promote industrial, agricultural and
livestock development in the region, because it will provide clean
and cheaper energy resources, Uruguayan authorities said.

<HEADLINE> 60 Sea Tigers Killed in Sri Lankan Air Force Attack </HEADLINE>

<P>
COLOMBO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan Air Force attacked
a flotilla of 20 Tamil rebel vessels, killing more than 60 Sea
Tigers (the naval wing of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam)
off the East Coast at Mullaitivu Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Air Force sources, the rebel flotilla is believed
to have been on its way to target a naval base at Trincomalee in
Eastern Province when it was attacked, the Island newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Initially an unmanned aerial vehicle of the Air Force had made
aerial reconnaissance on the flotilla as it set out from its base
at Chalai in the north.
</P>
<P>
This information had helped Air Force pilots to zero in on the
flotilla and four 250-kilogram bombs were dropped on the
unsuspecting Sea Tiger flotilla, taking it by surprise and giving
it no time to beat a retreat when the bombs exploded, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that a loud explosion along with the bombing
indicated that there had been explosives on board the Sea Tiger
ships.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Air Force also claimed that it successfully
bombed a camp in the Paranthan area in Northern Province Thursday
morning, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves IMF Spending Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United States Senate
approved on Thursday the Clinton administration's emergency
spending request of 18 billion U.S. dollars to finance the
International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The package, approved unanimously by the Senate, also includes
five billion dollars for disaster relief and military deployments
in the Gulf and Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Senate voted 84 to 16 in support of
President Bill Clinton's request for funding the IMF to deal with
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, who has
called the Asian crisis the "El Nino of economics", told the
Senate that failure to deal with the issue promptly would rock
financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Dow Jones Industrial Average had been
recently closing on 9,000 points. He stressed: "If we don't act,
the country Had better get ready for a slide on that."
</P>
<P>
The vote, attaching the entire IMF package to an emergency
spending bill for disaster relief and military operations, sets up
an expected confrontation with the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
House Republican leaders have said they want to deal with the
IMF issue separately from the disaster legislation.
</P>
<P>
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., an opponent of the bill, asserted
that IMF austerity programs served to further impoverish
populations and resulted in cheap exports that undercut American
products.
</P>
<P>
"We should use our leverage to change the flawed policies of
the IMF," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., a supporter, argued: ``You can't
remodel the emergency room at the very time patients are being
brought in."
</P>
<P>
The Senate package includes conditions, negotiated between
Republicans and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, urging the
world's major industrial nations to work to reform IMF loaning
practices.
</P>
<P>
The conditions also require countries that receive the IMF
assistance to comply with international trade agreements, and
would urge them to end government-directed lending and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
A House version, not expected to see floor action until after
an April recess, imposes much stricter conditions on the IMF loans.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the Senate also adopted a nonbinding
measure by a vote 90-10, calling on the United Nations to
"immediately reduce" the U.S. share of the cost of peacekeeping
operations, from about 30 percent to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
told the Senate that U.S. costs in the Gulf and supporting
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia far surpassed the
U.S. arrearages in United Nations dues. He described it as "money
which we do not owe and should never pay."

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Guangdong Province in south
China used 1.75 billion US dollars worth of overseas funds in
the first two months of the year, a year-on-year rise of 24.9
percent and a sure sign that China's foreign investment
readjustments have begun to work.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the number of new overseas investment

overseas capital up 18.3 percent, reversing the downhill slide in
foreign trade and economic cooperation of the past year, local
sources say.
</P>

The province handled 18.2 billion US dollars worth of imports
and exports in the two-month period, up 19.3 percent, with 11
billion US dollars of that caming from exports, a 22.5 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong plays an important role in China's foreign trade and
economic cooperation. Last year, it used 14.2 billion US dollars
worth of overseas funds and did slightly over 130 billion US
dollars worth of foreign trade, accounting for 22 percent and 40
percent of the national totals, respectively.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Serbia hopes with real earnesty
to cooperate with the international community on the basis of
mutual respect, equality and the exclusion of pressure, in its
efforts to solve the Kosovo issue, Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the Tanjug news agency as saying that the
international community should not support the Albanian
separatists in Kosovo, but should take a clear position against
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic was meeting the United States envoy, Robert
Gelbard, and the European Union representative and British
diplomat, Dzeremi Grinstok.
</P>
<P>
During separate talks with the two visitors, Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zironad Jovanovic reiterated that Kosovo had always been
an integral part of the Republic of Serbia and would remain so in
the future.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Kosovo issue must be solved through
dialogue within his republic.
</P>
<P>
Gelbard and Grinstok told the press that the six-nation Contact
Group on the Former Yugoslavia had expressed deep concern about
the failure of the Serbian and Albanian political leaders to
conduct any substantive dialogue on the Kosovo issue so far.
</P>
<P>
If no progress was to be made within four weeks, they warned,
the contact group would need to consider taking other measures on
the issue.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Sees Big Trade Surplus in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria saw a trade surplus of 369
million U.S. dollars in its foreign trade last year, the National
Statistical Institute (NSI) announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
However, trade volume dropped by 1.6 percent from 1996 to 9.8
billion U.S. dollars due to a contraction in imports, the
institute said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe the drastic devaluation of the lev during
the first quarter last year contributed to the import contraction,
which led to a surplus.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary figures, exports of wine and tobacco
dropped by 30 percent and fertilizers by 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
But imports of livestocks and animal products rose by 106
percent.
</P>
<P>
The NSI said that Bulgaria's trade with central and eastern
European countries dropped by 26 percent. Its exports to Russia
fell by 18 percent, to Ukraine by 12 percent and to Macedonia by
34 percent.
</P>
<P>
But exports to Italy and Greece increased by 17 percent, to
Turkey by 15 percent and to the U.S. by 14 percent, the institute
said.
</P>
<P>
Germany, France, Britain, Austria, and the Netherlands were
also among the main trading partners with Bulgaria, which
accounted for 65 percent of Bulgaria's foreign trade.

<P>
MADRID, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Dutch rider Jeroen Blijlevens
claimed the victory in the final sprint on Thursday to win the 204
kilometer fourth stage of the Catalan Week cycling race in a time
of five hours, 13 minutes and 35 seconds.
</P>
<P>
But fellow Dutchman Michael Boogerd retained the overall lead
in the race, establishing a 11-second advantage over France's
second-placed Laurent Jalabert.
</P>
<P>
The leading pack was still closely grouped as it entered the
closing sprint around 3.5 kms from the line, and it was not until
the final 50 meters that Blijlevens made his dash for the finish
line.
</P>
<P>
The Italians put in a strong performance with Mario Cipollini
and Nicolas Minali crossing the line second and third
respectively, to end with the same time as Blijlevens. Biagio
Conte finished in fourth position, also with the same time.
</P>
<P>
Swiss rider Alex Zuelle remained in sixth position in the
overall standings, still lagging the leaders by 30 seconds. But
with his preferred time-trial stage ahead of him, he was felt to
still have a realistic chance.
</P>
<P>
Friday's two-leg time-trial leg is a shorter 68kms between
Hospitalet de Llobregat and Sardanyola.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Declines to Reveal Plans for Acting Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has declined to confirm whether acting premier Sergei Kiriyenko
will occupy the post permanently, but brushed aside criticism that
Kiriyenko was too young for the job.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remark following Thursday's summit with French
President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said among the candidates for the post of prime
minister, there is a candidate in his 30s and one turning 70.
</P>
<P>
"That (age) doesn't bother us. The main thing is that the
person has the knowledge and skills a minister needs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin appointed 35-year-old Kiriyenko as acting premier on
Monday after firing the entire cabinet headed by former premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
He will name a new prime minister before April. Kiriyenko was
widely viewed as a firm favorite to assume the position.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the outgoing premier Viktor Chernomyrdin said
in Moscow that his party, Our Home is Russia, will never support
the new government if it attempts to change the route of Russia's
reforms.
</P>
<P>
They will only support a new government which sticks to
reforms, he said after a closed-door meeting of his party.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin has said that he expects to participate in the
formation of the new government.
</P>
<P>
His party discussed at their meeting proposals for new cabinet
members, he said.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Affects Costa Rica's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in some
Asian countries will cause a 20 percent decrease in Costa Rica's
exports this year, Ricardo Monge, a Costa Rican economist said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said Costa Rica's textile exports will suffer most from the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Exporters of Costa Rica and other Latin American countries lost
competitivity with the Southeast Asian region because of the
currency devaluation in most countries there, Monge said.
</P>
<P>
But the loss of competitivity was temporary, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Costa Rican producers are considering exporting more
products to the United States, which has absorbed 49 percent of
the exports from the central American country.
</P>
<P>
Also because of the currency devaluations in Southeast Asia,
Monge said foreign investments programmed for there had to be
postponed, and some were probably to be redirected to other
countries. Some would remain in Costa Rica where the government is
strengthening the development of the financial sector.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian Gold Production Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Peru's gold production increased by
17.3 percent in volume and 38.2 percent in value last year,
compared with 1996, the Gold Committee of the Mining and Oil
National Society said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gold production was up from 64.8 tons in 1996 to 76 tons in
1997, and its value rose from 579 million U.S. dollars to 800
million dollars during the same time, Jaime Uranga, the committee
president, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sixty percent of the total gold production was exported and 40
percent was consumed in the local market.
</P>
<P>
Gold bars and concentrates brought in 500 million dollars
while domestic sales earned 300 million dollars, a 20 percent
increase over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Uranga attributed the increase of domestic sales to higher
activity of the firms that manufacture gold articles, such as
jewelry and chains.
</P>
<P>
The value of gold exports ranked second in the country in 1997,
after copper, said Uranga.
</P>
<P>
Gold mining had created more direct and indirect jobs, and
would continue growing with the development of new projects, he
said.
</P>
<P>
At a world level, Peru achieved the biggest growth in the gold
industry in the past 12 years, Uranga added.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Debt Settlement Plan Awaits IMF Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
come up with a formula to resolve the country's mounting private
debt and would present it to International Monetary Fund (IMF)
officials on Friday, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the IMF are working on a package of measures
to overcome the country's prolonged economic turmoil, State
Companies Empowerment Minister Tanri Abeng said here Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has depreciated by over 70 percent
against the U.S. dollar since July last year, making it virtually
impossible for companies to repay their foreign debts which now
total 74 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts held that the private sector foreign debt is
one of the major causes of the monetary crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has been negotiating with foreign
banks and companies for rescheduling the country's private sector
debts.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Managing Director Miranda Gultom said Thursday
that a suggested six-month postponement of Indonesian companies'
repayments of principal on their debt may not be long enough.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, which has suspended its second 3 billion U.S. dollar
disbursement from its 43 billion dollar rescue package to
Indonesia, is now in talks with the country on economic reforms it
agreed upon on January 15.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Sees High Mortality, Low Birth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria is currently experiencing
a high adult and infant mortality rate, alongside a low birth rate
and a short life expectancy, statistics released Thursday at a
meeting of the National Development Council stated.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Bulgaria's infant mortality rate reached 15.6 per
1,000, which is much higher than many European countries. The
country's death rate was 14 per 1,000, and its birth rate reached
6 per 1,000, council statistics claim.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy of people in the country is too short by
European standards, the council said. The average length of life
is 67.1 years for men, and 74.6 years for women. Maternal
mortality is quadruple the average European level.
</P>
<P>
Experts said efforts should be concentrated on reducing the
high death rate. A healthy way of living and raising children's
health awareness are also essential, they added.

<P>
ROME, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Inge De Bruijn of the Netherlands
broke the women's 50 meters butterfly European record on the final
day of a two-day World Cup short-course swimming meeting in
Imperia, Italy on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
De Bruijn swam 26.61 seconds, breaking the old record of 26.97
seconds set by German Olympic bronze medallist Sandra Voelker in
Gelsenkirchen, Germany, on February 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
De Bruijn, who had taken third place in the 50 meters freestyle
and second place in the 100 meters butterfly on Wednesday, held
the European record in the same event for five years between 1991
and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch powered home almost one second ahead of compatriot
Angela Postma in 27.58 and Katrin Jaeke of Germany in 27.75.
</P>
<P>
Voelker continued her feat last month in Hong Kong of China,
where she won four gold medals in the FINA World Cup short course
meet, took both the 100 freestyle and 100 backstroke gold medals,
in 54.72 and in one minute 00.23 seconds respectively.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Lorenzo Vismara surprised Olympic champion Alexander
Popov in men's 50 meters freestyle to win the event in 21.97, 0.1
seconds ahead, while Chris Fydler of Australia placed third in
22.42.
</P>
<P>
Fydler, who swam the freestyle leg in Australia's gold-winning
4x100 medley relay at the swimming championships in January, won
the the 200 meters freestyle event in 1.46.29, ahead of Igor
Koleda of Belarus in 1.46.67 and Massimiliano Rosolino of Italy in
1.47.78.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Chile's exports to Asia in the
first two months of this year shrank 23.1 percent to 703.3 million
U.S. dollars, while Chilean imports grew 43.2 percent to 574.6
million dollars, a report from the Central Bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the export decrease and import increase
to the financial crisis in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Chile's leading trade partner in Asia. Japan's
imports, which account for more than 50 percent of Chile's
exports, amounted to 403 million dollars during January-February,
down 10.3 percent from the 449.6 million dollars in the same
period last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine, Malaysia to Go Into No-Dollar Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank has
approved the country's entry into a regional currency trading
scheme with Malaysia to reduce dependence on the U.S. dollar,
Manila Standard reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as
saying the scheme will "immediately be implemented" once he signs
in May an agreement with his Malaysian counterpart.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bilateral agreement involves the netting-out of
trade between the two countries which will be settled in dollars.
</P>
<P>
"You pay only the difference (between exports and imports), so
you reduce the transactions in dollars," Singson said, adding that
the central banks of the two countries would settle their trade
obligations every two months.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, Filipino exporters would have to source pesos
from the central bank, to which importers would be paying also in
pesos. This system will work the same way in Malaysia, Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and Malaysia would be the first countries in
the Southeast Asian region to enter into the regional currency
trading agreement.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers of the nine-member Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed last month that the trading
scheme should be implemented on a bilateral basis rather than
imposed as a regional mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the Philippines and Malaysia, other members of the
ASEAN are Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand
and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN has been seeking to reduce dependence on the U.S.
dollar amid a regional currency crisis which triggered the
devaluation of most regional currencies against the dollar.

<HEADLINE> FIFA to Accept Blatter's Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body FIFA
said on Thursday that FIFA General Secretary Sepp Blatter would
formally announce his candidature for the presidency of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA source said: "The president (Joao Havelange) expects to
be at FIFA House in Zurich tomorrow morning at which time he will
accept a letter from Mr. Blatter which will point out his
candidature for the presidency."
</P>
<P>
Blatter will also step down, temporarily at least, from his
duties as General Secretary while campaigning for the presidency.
FIFA have not yet announced who will take over in his absence,
although it could be his deputy Michel Zen-Rufinen.
</P>
<P>
Joao Havelange, who is stepping down as FIFA president in June
after 24 years ruling, has been actively canvassing for Blatter
for many months and endorsed him again in Zurich recently.
</P>
<P>
"If he decides to stand, I will be delighted because he will
make a first class president," said Havelange.
</P>
<P>
"Many General Secretaries have followed their presidents into
the role and why should there be any difference in this case."
</P>
<P>
It is understood that at least three national associations have
indicated they are prepared to formally nominate Blatter by the
time nominations close on April 7, although a spokesman for the
Trinidad and Tobago association denied on Thursday they had
already done so.
</P>
<P>
"We have made no public decision on Mr. Blatter's candidature
yet," said a spokesman, "because as far as we are concerned he has
not yet declared his interest."
</P>
<P>
UEFA President Lennart Johansson of Sweden is the only declared
candidate at present.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for bids to succeed Havelange is April 7 and the
election will take place at the FIFA Congress in Paris on June 8.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis to Dominate ASEM II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in Asia will
be the dominant issue at the Second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM II)
next week in London, a British diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
ASEM II is expected to result in an initiative increasing
European technical assistance to the troubled economies, British
Ambassador to Indonesia Robin Christopher said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The initiative will focus on the financial sector restructure
and poverty impact assessment," Antara News Agency Friday quoted
Christopher as saying.
</P>
<P>
He also said Britain has proposed the establishment of an ASEM
trust fund at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The trust fund is aimed at assessing the poverty impact of the
crisis by looking at the implications for public expenditure
priorities, social action programs and enterprise development to
generate employment opportunities," he noted.
</P>
<P>
It will also provide assistance for financial sector
restructuring, including bank monitoring and supervision,
corporate governance and accounting standards, he added.
</P>
<P>
Christopher disclosed that Britain will provide 50 million
pounds sterling in credit re-insurance for private sector credit
agencies which have stopped covering for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The British envoy said he believes Asia, including Indonesia,
will recover from the crisis and the remarkable record of economic
growth in the region will resume.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe that the roaring tigers of 1997 have turned
into tame pussy-cats overnight. They will surely resume their real
nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Asian crisis, ASEM II will discuss three other
important points identified at the first meeting in Bangkok,
namely to foster political dialogue, reinforce economic
cooperation and promote cooperation in other areas.
</P>
<P>
"ASEM II is likely to produce a number of new initiatives,
covering trade, investment, environment -- both management and
disaster preparedness," Christopher said.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Referees Forecast No Red Card Bonanza in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body FIFA
and their World Cup referees estimated that there would be no red
card bonanza over the tackle from behind during the World Cup
finals this summer.
</P>
<P>
According to local reports on Thursday, the referees said they
were happy with the definition of the tackle from behind that
comes into effect in the finals starting in France on June 10.
</P>
<P>
"I really don't think referees are going to go crazy and use a
lot of red cards," David Will, president of the world body's
referees committee said.
</P>
<P>
"We're not adding many to the tackles already deserving red
cards," he told a news conference at the end of the World Cup
referees' workshop outside Paris this week.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see players taken out of the game like
(Marco) van Basten, for instance, with this kind of tackling,"
Will said.
</P>
<P>
Argentine referee Javier Castrilli, known as 'Lawman' in South
America because of his strictness, said: "FIFA are putting the
accent on fair play. This (ruling) is eloquent proof of that.
</P>
<P>
"From the World Cup all players who attack (another) from
behind with a tackle including a follow through will get a red
card," he said when pressed to describe the action that will be
punished by a sending off.
</P>
<P>
But Italian Pierluigi Collina said: "It depends on the approach
of the defender. The most important thing is that the integrity
of the player (being marked) is preserved.
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't matter if you touch the ball or not. You can't
anticipate what the player (with the ball) is going to do, but he
has to be free (to play the ball)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Collina said there would be no more pressure on referees than
when they had to first apply the so-called professional foul
ruling, bringing down a player with a scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
Will said that there were basically two scenarios for the
tackle from behind that FIFA had been through with the referees
during their seminars from Tuesday to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The first has a player with the ball at his feet, perhaps
still, perhaps moving, perhaps preparing to part with it. A player
comes from behind and removes the (other) player, who doesn't even
see his opponent coming, from the game.
</P>
<P>
"There is almost certainly an injury in such circumstances and
this should always have been punished with a red card, that's
nothing new," Will said.
</P>
<P>
"What is new is if a player is off and running with the ball
and an opponent comes from behind and clips his feet from under
him. It's perhaps not particularly violent but deliberately takes
the player from the game.
</P>
<P>
"It's what in English we call the professional foul. The
difference is that now no matter where (it occurs) on the field of
play it gets a red card. Before it was only in a goal scoring
situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that whereas before referees weighed up whether to
punish such a tackle with a yellow or red card, they could no
longer opt for anything other than sending the culprit off.
</P>
<P>
"We have removed the doubt in referees' minds. Players must not
be permitted to attack (another) player."
</P>
<P>
Asked how referees would deal with the situation if a player
feigned being injured when challenged from behind, Will said
feigning in general was covered in a seminar.
</P>
<P>
"This is the worst kind of cheating and referees were made
aware of this not just for the tackle from behind," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It won't be easy," Will admitted. "But it is FIFA's
determination to end deliberate taking out of a player."
</P>
<P>
Will said FIFA were producing a video with examples of the kind
of tackle they are trying to stamp out to show referees and the 32
teams that will play in the June 10-July 12 tournament "and
perhaps even to the media".

WASHINGTON -- Indications show that the Clinton administration
is making some small gestures toward Iran and has eased off its
customary anti-Tehran rhetoric as part of an effort to improve
relations.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin confirmed Thursday at a
regular briefing that the administration had given permission to
Mohammad Hadi Nejad-Hosseinian, Iran's top diplomat at the United
Nations, to travel to Los Angeles and deliver a speech on April 2
at an Iran-U.S. symposium sponsored by the World Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
"We have given permission for the Iranian U.N. permanent
representative to travel outside New York City to deliver a speech
to a private American group in Los Angeles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said such an overture was quite rare as Iranian
officials at the United Nations could only travel within a limited
area of New York City. (US-Iran)

WASHINGTON -- The United States said Thursday that it hopes the

should be of a limited timeframe," James P. Rubin, the State
Department spokesman, said Thursday. (US-UN-Yugoslavia)

</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said this at a press conference after his meeting with
French President Jacques Chirac and German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. He said, "It is from here that a multipolar world will
evolve, not from any one state, but from a number of states, a
number of leaders."
</P>
<P>
"It is here that a multipolar approach is being formed, and it
is from here that it will spread around the world," he said,
adding there should be no discrimination against any state in the
modern world. (Russia-Summit)

MEXICO CITY, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- Foreign currency deposits in Argentina grew 1.9
percent in February and loans to the private sector 1.4 percent
over the previous month.
</P>
<P>
Foreign currency deposits increased 4.2 percent in current
accounts, and 2.2 percent in fixed terms above January, said
Argentina's Banks Association.

percent in Venezuela in 1999, forecast Jose Luis Hernandez,
president of the Chamber of Venezuelan Manufacturers of Motor
Vehicles.
</P>

reduced and the possible rise of interest rates in the first
months of 1999.

billion dollars by the year 2005.
</P>

</P>
<P>
BRASILIA -- Brazil registered a 747 million dollar trade
deficit in the first two months of the year, said the Ministry of
Industry, Commerce, and Tourism.
</P>
<P>
The deficit resulted from imports for 8,376 million dollars,
which surpassed exports for 7,629 million dollars during the
period.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 11.7 percent and imports contracted 0.61
percent, compared to the same period of 1997.

<HEADLINE> UK Gov't Unveils Radical Welfare Reform Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- British Social Security Minister
Frank Field unveiled plans Thursday to overhaul the old welfare
system by turning the country from a welfare state to a "self-help
state."
</P>
<P>
By publishing a "green paper" consultative document, Field
promised a host of new welfare policies, built on the principle of
work for all those who were capable, already a prominent feature
of many of its policies.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament that the current system promoted fraud and
deception and had led to poverty and dependence, and the
government sought to replace the cycle of dependency and
insecurity with ethics of work and savings.
</P>
<P>
"Work is the best form of welfare. To those of working age we
offer greater help to get into work, and a modern system to
provide help for those in genuine need who can't work," Field
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that while the basic state pension remained guaranteed,
he was considering plans to make second pensions compulsory.
</P>
<P>
The paper, which took the Labor government 10 months to draw
up, set out a list of eight principles that will underpin the
reform, along with a list of benchmarks against which progress can
be judged.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has made welfare reform a central
plank of his government's program since he formed the cabinet in
May last year.

<HEADLINE> EU to Help Asia Fight Environment Disasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook Thursday announced an EU initiative to help Southeast Asian
countries better prepared to deal with natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, to be managed by the European Community
Humanitarian Office (ECHO), aims to transfer the technology,
skills and management needed to combat fires, floods, earthquakes,
typhoons and pollution from toxic substances.
</P>
<P>
The ECHO program, which will include Malaysia, Vietnam,
Indonesia, the Philippines and Thailand, also envisages training
farmers in land use techniques and forest management to limit soil
erosion.
</P>
<P>
"It is an example of practical diplomacy and partnership at
work and one that will make a real difference to the lives of
people in the region," Robin Cook told a news conference to launch
the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The ECHO has already earmarked 1 million pounds (1.7 million
U.S. dollars) for the initiative and is planning for substantially
more funds available in future years.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, already approved in preparatory meetings, will
be endorsed by Asian and European leaders when they meet in London
next week for the second Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM 2).
</P>
<P>
Environment will be an important issue in ASEM 2, which will
draw heads of government from 25 Asian and European nations, Robin
Cook said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Shows Gestures to Iran for Improvement of Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Indications show that the
Clinton administration is making some small gestures toward Iran
and has eased off its customary anti-Tehran rhetoric as part of an
effort to improve relations.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin confirmed Thursday at a
regular briefing that the administration had given permission to
Mohammad Hadi Nejad-Hosseinian, Iran's top diplomat at the United
Nations, to travel to Los Angeles and deliver a speech on April 2
at an Iran-U.S. symposium sponsored by the World Affairs Council.
</P>
<P>
"We have given permission for the Iranian U.N. permanent
representative to travel outside New York City to deliver a speech
to a private American group in Los Angeles," he said.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said such an overture was quite rare as Iranian
officials at the United Nations could only travel within a limited
area of New York City.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said the administration had granted a visa to the
director of women's affairs of Iran so that she could deliver a
speech in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said Rubin's comments on the state of U.S.-Iranian
relations were notably devoid of the traditional emphasis on the
areas of disagreement such as U.S. allegations of Iranian support
for terrorism, development of weapons of mass destruction and
efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States was encouraged for the warmth and
courtesy Iranians had shown to American visitors lately.
</P>
<P>
Recently, six American scholars, including two former U.S.
government officials, attended a conference on Gulf security in
Tehran as guests of the Iranian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't have one word of hostility aimed at me. No one was
trampling on any (U.S.) flags," said Roscoe Suddarth, a former
State Department official who was among the six-scholar group.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United States hoped to have direct talks with
the Iranian government. But since Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said it would be premature to hold
government-to-government talks, the United States would pursuing
people-to-people contacts.
</P>
<P>
"we have said that we are facilitating people-to-people
exchanges by working with private American organizations who wish
to host Iranian visitors or send groups to Iran," Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Rainstorm Hits Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Torrential rains, gale-force winds
and snowfalls have been sweeping most parts of Greece since
Wednesday, causing extensive flooding, power shortage and
black-outs, traffic snarls and flight cancellations.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government held an emergency meeting later Thursday
to discuss measures to deal with the problems caused by the bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
Schools have been ordered to be closed Thursday as both
domestic and international flights were canceled at the Athens
airport.
</P>
<P>
Domestic flights were being diverted to the northern Kavala's
Alexander the Great airport while Thessaloniki's Macedonia airport
was receiving international flights.
</P>
<P>
The bad weather has affected the power stations in the country
with black-outs being reported throughout Greece, bringing trolley
buses to a standstill in Athens for more than two hours and
causing problems to the city's rail network.
</P>
<P>
In Athens' southern suburb of Glyfada, some 5,000 trees are
estimated to have been uprooted by gale-force winds and 75 cars
were damaged by falling trees. Floodings have caused extensive
damage to 20 homes and 45 stores in the area.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of villages in the western Peloponnese peninsula and
northern Greece have been cut off by heavy snowfalls.
</P>
<P>
In the southeastern island of Rhodes, one man died while trying
to moor his boat.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Insists on F-22 Fighter Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon Thursday rejected
a congressional agency suggestion that the program for developing
F-22 fighters should be delayed because of engineering problems
and a lack of testing.
</P>
<P>
The F-22 is designed to replace aging F-15s and F-16s in the
coming century, U.S. Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon
said at a Pentagon news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The plane, using stealth or radar-evading technology and is
intended primarily to combat enemy fighter aircraft, is the
premier Air Force weapons program.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to make the program work," said Bacon. "We want to
stay on schedule."
</P>
<P>
The Air Force says that a delay of the program recommended by
the General Accounting Office (GAO) would add billions of dollars
into the most recent estimate of 62 billion U.S. dollars. That is
187 million dollars per plane.
</P>
<P>
The GAO said in a report disclosed by U.S. media that the
Pentagon should delay a decision to spend 595 million dollars on
the first two production planes until late 1999. But the Air Force
insisted it was ready to approve production in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
"A 12-month slip is not something we're contemplating," Bacon
said.

<HEADLINE> Donors To Replenish 2.75 Bln Dlrs for Global </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six donors from both
developing and developing countries have agreed to a second
replenishment of 2.75 billion U.S. dollars for the Global
Environment Facility (GEF), the GEF announced here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The replenishment comes as the GEF prepares to hold its first
assembly of 162 participating nations in New Delhi in early April.
</P>
<P>
The GEF is a multilateral financing mechanism established in
1991 to provide grant and concessional funds to developing
countries to conserve and use biodiversity sustainably, reduce the
risk of climate change, protect international waters, phase out
ozone depleting substances and combat deforestation and
desertification.
</P>
<P>
The first GEF replenishment took place in 1994. During the
four-year period, some 2 billion dollars were provided. Since
1991, the GEF has allocated 1.9 billion dollars in grant funding
to over 500 projects in 119 countries, leveraging an additional 5
billion dollars in co-financing. GEF projects are implemented by
the United Nations Development Program, the United Nations
Environment Program and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon's Anti-Sectarianism Effort Meets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi's
crusade against the sectarian political system did not have a
smooth start as his proposal of civil marriage designed for the
purpose has met strong opposition.
</P>
<P>
Under his proposal, civil issues as marriage and divorce will
be authorized by government institutions rather than religious
courts.
</P>
<P>
It is intended to pave the way for the marriage between
Lebanese with different religious belief and who refuse to convert.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi has aimed his proposal, if approved by the Parliament to
become law, at helping the Lebanese get together by ending the
sectarian political and social system, which has led to three
civil wars since 1860.
</P>
<P>
"My goal is to eliminate all forms of sectarianism ..., the
country has had enough sectarianism," Hrawi said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief in "absolute equality among the
Lebanese," saying that "we must achieve this so as to get rid of
the rule of sects."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has 17 different religious sects, which control the
country's political and social life.
</P>
<P>
He contended that the president, the parliament speaker and the
prime minister should work for the entire nation, not for separate
sects.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lebanese constitution, the country's president comes
from the Maronite catholic, the prime minister from the Sunni
Muslims and the parliament speaker from the Shiite Muslims.
</P>
<P>
As many have expected, Hrawi's proposal has brought about deep
rifts among different political and religious groups and is
causing hot debate.
</P>
<P>
The country's Islamic clerics have branded the proposal of
civil marriage as "a violation of the core of Islamic religious
thought and belief."
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the cabinet approved the bill on March 18, Sheikh
Mohammed Madhi Shamseddine, spiritual leader of the Shiite
Muslims, and Sheikh Mohammed Rasheed Kabbani, the mufti of the
Sunni Muslims, issued a joint statement condemning the proposal as
an "insult" to the Muslims and therefore it is "illegitimate."
</P>
<P>
They vowed they will spearhead a national campaign to confront
the "dangerous proposal," which they said they will never accept
under any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Around the country, Muslims who oppose the proposal stage
protests after Friday prayers, attacking politicians for pushing
ahead with the bill.
</P>
<P>
Patriarch Nasrallah Butros Sfeir, spiritual leader of the
Maronite community, Lebanon's largest Christian sect, has expressed
his opposition to the bill.
</P>
<P>
Civil marriage will go against the church's teachings, he said,
warning that the couples who engage in civil marriage will be
shouted out of the church.
</P>
<P>
Despite opposition from religious sects, the country's
politicians and intellectuals, including 21 ministers of the
30-member cabinet and Parliament Speaker Nabih berry, have
expressed their support for Hrawi's proposal.
</P>
<P>
But Prime Minister Rafik Hariri and five of his followers in
the cabinet voted against the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said he did not oppose the civil marriage itself, but
the timing of the proposal when "Lebanon and the region as a whole
are passing a critical phase and require a high degree of unity
and vigilance."
</P>
<P>
"We must avoid any issue that could have a negative impact on
national unity or lead to divisions inside or outside the
cabinet," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Hrawi has said the prime minister must comply with the
cabinet decision, or has to resign.

<HEADLINE> Former French PM Reserved Over Idea of Banning FN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Former French Prime Minister
Raymond Barre Thursday expressed his reservation over the idea of
banning the far-right National Front (FN), because he said it is
"a party which respects the rules of public order."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily Le Figaro to be published
Friday, Barre said that a banning of the FN could result in "a
flow of votes to the extreme left," which has risen over the past
10 months since the Socialist-led leftwing coalition came to
power.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of discontent of the voters who supported the
leftwing coalition in the last legislative elections, the French
Troskyist extreme-left groups, such as Lutte Ouvriere, won 4 plus
percent of votes in the regional elections held on March 15 and
entered the regional parliament in Paris for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Barre, who is now mayor of the central industrial city of Lyon
elected from the center-right Union for French Democracy (UDF),
also suggested that all political leaders of the Gaullist Rally
for the Republic (RPR) and the UDF reach a gentlemen's agreement
to avoid an alliance between the FN and rightwing politicians in
future elections.
</P>
<P>
He also said that one should not ally with the FN under
whatever excuses. He expressed his dismay over the acceptance of
FN votes by former Defense Minister Charles Millon when seeking
reelection to regional council presidency in Rhone-Alpes region,
in which Lyon is located.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Proposes New Rules on Transplant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government said
Thursday that there should be regulations for organ transplant so
that those who need them most can get them first.
</P>
<P>
Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Donna Shalala said
the new plan would be fairer and would save lives.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 54,500 people on the national transplant
waiting list, and 10 people die every day while waiting for an
organ transplant.
</P>
<P>
"The point is to make sure you are treated fairly and equitably
no matter where you are in the country," Shalala told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"My concern and the reason for this regulation is that people
are dying unnecessarily, not because they don't have health
insurance and not because they don't have adequate care, but
simply because of where they live in this country," she said.
</P>
<P>
Under her proposal, the essentially regional system for organ
allocation should be replaced by a single national list.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, a donated organ is first made
available locally, and if there is no one who needs it or whose
tissue matches it, it is offered regionally and then nationally.
</P>
<P>
Shalala said that under the current system, sometimes people
with less need got an organ before someone with a greater need.
</P>
<P>
"The system was so decentralized that the movement and
allocation of organs have not followed need," Shalala said.
</P>
<P>
She said it should be changed "so that an accident of location
doesn't affect whether you live or die."
