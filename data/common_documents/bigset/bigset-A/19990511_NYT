 Chronicle Publishing Considers Strategy, Hires Investment
Banker  to Advise Owners 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (c) 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle Publishing Co., owner of the San Francisco
Chronicle, KRON-TV and several other media properties, said it has
hired an investment banking firm to ``review and evaluate the
company's financial, business and strategic plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Chronicle Publishing chief executive John Sias said the
move doesn't signal a sale, industry observers said hiring New
York's Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette strongly suggests the privately
held company will put all or part of itself up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine times out of 10 that's what happens when you hire an
investment banker,'' said John Morton, a media consultant in Silver
Spring, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing owns The San Francisco Chronicle and two
other newspapers, the Bloomington (Ill.) Pantagraph and the
Worcester (Mass.) Telegram &AMP; Gazette. It owns three TV stations:
KRON in San Francisco; KAKE in Wichita, Kan.; and WOWT in Omaha,
Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Other properties include Chronicle Books and MBI, a Wisconsin
book publisher. Online service SFGate and cable news channel BayTV
round out the company's holdings and give it a total employment of
about 3,200.
</P>
<P>
   If the company were put up for sale, the buyer probably could
not own The Chronicle and KRON. Chronicle Publishing is exempt from
Federal Communications Commission rules that generally prohibit
ownership of a TV station and daily newspaper in the same market.
However, the agency is expected to review whether the rules should
be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Chronicle Publishing board declined comment. But
Francis Martin, a member of a family that controls one-sixth of the
company's shares, sought to dampen speculation about a sale or
breakup of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hired them (DLJ) to do an analysis of what our
strategic options might be,'' Martin said. ``We have not asked them
to come in and appraise the value of our assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Broadwater, managing director of Veronis Suhler &AMP;
Associates, a New York investment bank that specializes in media
deals, said there is a ``somewhat of a seller's market'' for
newspaper and television properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest in newspaper ownership is as strong as we've seen it
since the late 1980s,'' Broadwater said. ``TV broadcasting is
another area that is hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Any possible sale of The Chronicle involves New York's Hearst
Corp., publisher of the San Francisco Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Until 2005, The Chronicle and the Examiner are under a
joint-operating agreement. Signed in 1965, the JOA allowed the two
papers to share noneditorial operations such as printing,
circulation and advertising. The papers equally share revenues and
expenses from their joint operation, the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The papers maintain separate newsrooms and separate ownership.
The agreement also dictates that The Chronicle publish in the
morning and the Examiner in the afternoon. Each paper contributes
sections to a combined Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Chronicle Publishing are privately held, and neither
has disclosed all the terms of the JOA. But it is widely assumed
the deal gives either paper first crack at buying the other, Morton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The JOA makes it difficult to estimate the value of The
Chronicle, he added, because an outside bidder would have to split
profits with Hearst Corp. until 2005, then face the prospect that
the Examiner might switch to morning publication after the JOA
expires, starting a costly newspaper war.
</P>
<P>
   Based on The Chronicle's current circulation of 475,000, Morton
estimated the paper could fetch $400 million to $1 billion or more.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sacramento's McClatchy Newspapers paid $1.2 billion
for the Minneapolis Star Tribune, which had 387,000 subscribers at
the time. But Morton said the Star Trib wasn't encumbered by a JOA
and wasn't ringed by suburban newspaper chains, whereas The
Chronicle must compete with Knight Ridder Inc. in Santa Clara and
Contra Costa counties, Gannett Corp. in Marin and the Alameda
Newspaper Group in the East Bay.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the last, large family-owned newspapers in the nation,
The Chronicle would likely attract interest from all the large
newspaper chains, Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Flynn, a television industry analyst with Kagan Media
Appraisals in Carmel, said two recent broadcast deals provide
benchmarks for the potential worth of NBC affiliate KRON, the
largest of Chronicle Publishing's three broadcast properties.
</P>
<P>
   She said CBS paid $485 million last month to buy a CBS-affiliate
station in Dallas, the nation's seventh-largest media market. The
San Francisco Bay Area is No. 5 in market size. In another deal,
Hearst-Argyle Corp., Hearst's television arm, paid $530 million
last year to acquire KCRA-TV and two smaller TV properties in
Sacramento, ranked 20th market in size, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final price anyone is willing to pay depends on the cash
flow and the profitability of the station, and just how much the
buyer wants to be in San Francisco,'' Flynn said.
</P>
<P>
   One source said that TV stations typically sell for 12 to 13
times cash flow. The source estimated that KRON's annual cash flow
is $40 million to $50 million, giving it a ballpark value of $480
million to $650 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle was founded in 1865 by two brothers, Michael and
Charles DeYoung. The company is still owned by their descendants.
But as shares have passed from generation to generation, control
has become widely dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the shares are owned by Nan Tucker McEvoy and her
son Nion McEvoy, who also sits on the Chronicle Publishing board.
Members of the Theriot and Stent families together control another
third of the company. The Tobin and Martin families control the
remaining third.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 and 1997, the family owners of Chronicle Publishing
called in outside investment bankers or consultants for advice. In
1992, this process led to the hiring of outside managers to replace
family members who had, until then, run the newspaper and
television operations.
</P>
<P>
   Until the mid-1990s, Nan McEvoy and members of the Tobin clan
constituted a shareholder majority in favor of retaining family
ownership. But that coalition broke down, leaving the McEvoys in
the minority.
</P>
<P>
   If DLJ should recommend the sale of the entire company, that
decision would need to be approved by a majority of the 10-member
board of directors and by shareholders owning a majority of the
stock, according to one source.
</P>
<P>
   But a majority of the board could vote to sell parts of the
company without shareholder approval, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's bylaws apparently would let the board, which
consists of five family members and five outside directors, sell
the largest and most valuable properties, including The Chronicle
and KRON, without a shareholder vote.

BOOS RAIN DOWN ON HULL IN HIS RETURN TO ST. LOUIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ They booed Brett Hull when he stepped on the ice.
They booed Brett Hull when his name was announced. They booed him
loudest when he scored a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, once the favorite son of St. Louis _ once as big as
the Cardinals' Mark McGwire _ was given the villain treatment last
night as he returned for the playoffs in a Stars uniform. And while
Hull scored a goal in the Stars' 3-2 overtime loss, he left the
game mostly as just another player on another team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they're over it,'' he said. ``I mean, it's been a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who scored most of his 586 career goals (13th all-time in
the NHL) in a Blues uniform, left the Blues as a free agent in the
summer and signed with the Stars. Going back, even in a loss, even
to be booed, was seen as a good thing, as part of his transition to
the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays for the Dallas Stars,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said before the game. ``He's going to have to learn to get over it.
That's the business of hockey. There's too much at stake right now
for him to worry about anything other than contributing to our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull said he did just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done, this is old news,'' he said. ``I play for the
Stars.''
Lehtinen hurt
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Jere Lehtinen _ one of the finalists to win the
Selke Trophy as best defensive forward in the NHL _ left last
night's game in the second period with a right knee sprain and did
not return. Lehtinen got tangled up with a Blues player in front of
the Stars' net.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock juggled his lines and ended up playing Jamie
Langenbrunner on the left wing with Hull and Mike Modano.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all over the map there for a while,'' Hitchcock said.
``But I thought Langenbrunner did a good job on the left side.''
Lukowich in
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Shawn Chambers missed last night's game with a
knee sprain and is listed as day-to-day. He could return for Game
4, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   In Chambers' place, rookie Brad Lukowich played his fourth game
of the playoffs. Lukowich has moved in and out of the lineup with
surprising ease, Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think of him as a minor-league player anymore.
We've just got a good up-and-coming National Hockey League player
now,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's hard for him to come in and go out
like that, but when he did that in the first round, he didn't get
worse, he got better.''
Carbonneau to return
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Guy Carbonneau attended the funeral of his father
in Quebec yesterday and is expected to join the Stars today.
Carbonneau, who has missed the past five games with a knee injury,
is expected to play in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Also out for the Stars last night were: Chambers (knee), Doug
Lidster, Blake Sloan, Tony Hrkac, Jon Sim and Aaron Gavey. Gavey
was brought up from the Michigan K-Wings and will practice with the
Stars for the remainder of the playoffs.
Sloan scratched
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the playoffs, Hitchcock made a healthy
scratch of winger Sloan. In place of Sloan, Hitchcock used Derek
Plante to center the third line of Mike Keane and Tony Hrkac and
inserted Pat Verbeek in Sloan's place on the fourth line with Dave
Reid and Brian Skrudland. Verbeek was returning from a one-game
suspension for a slashing incident in Game 1.
Streak alive
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner extended his career best playoff scoring streak to
six games. Langenbrunner assisted on Hull's first-period power-play
goal and has three goals and four assists during the streak.

HOUSTON FISHES FOR ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ While the Los Angeles Lakers pondered ways
to slow Charles Barkley, the Houston Rockets had their own
head-scratching sessions to figure out how to stop the Lakers'
offensive triad of Shaquille O'Neal, Glen Rice and, of course,
Derek Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so throw Kobe Bryant in there, too. Those four starters
combined for 93 points in Game 1 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was Fisher's 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played much better than we anticipated, much better than we
wanted him to play,'' Houston's Scottie Pippen said. ``That sort of
hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest contribution was Rice's 29 points. And even more
impressive that it came against Pippen, one of the best defenders
in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realize when you have a guy that's such a great player as
Scottie Pippen, you can't go out there and go half-speed,'' Rice
said. ``You gotta really go out there and try to take it to him as
much as possible. If you don't, he'll embarrass you out there, and
I don't wanna get embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot-shooting Rice scored 20 points in the first half but was
relatively quiet in the second, taking only three shots in the
fourth quarter as Pippen played him tighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became a no-leave guy,'' Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said.
``(Pippen) made sure he was staying home on Glen to give him less
and less opportunities to get the basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, meant one fewer Rockets defender to double-team
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's hot streak has been timely. Over the last three games,
Rice is averaging 30.3 points _ he averaged 7.0 in the two previous
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a zone right now,'' O'Neal said, ``and when a guy like
that is in the zone, you gotta keep him in the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Undaunted: O'Neal missed 3 of 4 free throws down the stretch
Sunday, including an instance when Barkley intentionally fouled him
after a defensive rebound, showing the lack of respect opponents
have for his foul shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna hit them,'' O'Neal, a 53-percent career foul
shooter, vowed once again. ``I'm not worried, I'm not worried at
all. Do I look worried?''
</P>
<P>
   And he still dreams of making two free throws to win a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, down by one, no seconds on the clock, I'm gonna hit
two in a row, and I'm flipping all of y'all off, all the media. No,
just kidding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I like to shut you guys (reporters) up because I
know you guys think I can't do certain things. I can do it all. I'm
an all-purpose big man. Did you see, I got out, led the break,
threw the lob to Kobe (for a dunk on Sunday). Passing, give and go,
play defense at the end. I just like to shut people up.''

CHINA'S GOVERNMENT WIDENS ROLE IN ANTI-U.S. PROTESTS AT EMBASSY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials choreographed protests against the
American Embassy here on Monday, with a relentless procession of
tens of thousands of angry demonstrators that lasted into the
night.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday morning only a few scattered protests occurred
around the embassy, a sign that the government had decided to
moderate the anti-American campaign after three days of sometimes
violent protests, set off by the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade during a NATO raid on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday morning, Chinese television and newspapers belatedly
reported for the first time that President Clinton and other NATO
leaders had made apologies for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how far the reported apologies
would mollify an enraged population. In New York on Monday night a
senior Chinese diplomat, Liu Xiaoming, indicated that Clinton's
words to date were insufficient, saying, ``So far I have not seen a
formal and serious apology.''
</P>
<P>
   The marchers on Monday were ushered by police officers to within
25 feet of the embassy. Many chanted ``Down with American
imperialism!'' and sang the Chinese national anthem. The protests
were more controlled than those over the weekend. But young men
continued to heave pieces of concrete against the battered facade
right over the helmeted militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the situation over the weekend, when tens of
thousands of spontaneous anti-NATO protesters roamed almost at
will, the authorities had protest groups keep to a schedule and
designated their route.
</P>
<P>
   As it tightened control over the demonstrations and then halted
them, the governing Communist Party appeared to be attempting to
harness public passions, both to contain them and to reinforce its
control over society. In an elaborately staged display of national
unity, over the last two days government offices and social
organizations around the country were ordered to hold meetings and
issue denunciations of the bombing, people involved said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday most of the protesters were university students and
faculty members, but some state companies were also allowed to send
large delegations. Demonstrators said that as their organizations
applied for permission to come to the embassy, the Public Security
Bureau told them when and where to assemble.
</P>
<P>
   Students, workers and others who showed up on their own were
allowed to tag along with an approved group.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of how well the day's protests were staged,
representatives of major official religious groups arrived and
marched in sequence _ dozens of Buddhist monks, followed by a
contingent of Tibetans monks, then Taoists, then Catholic,
Protestant and Muslim leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I am a Chinese, why do you think I shouldn't come?''
snapped a Tibetan monk in a scarlet robe when asked why he was
marching.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans have been advised to exercise caution, the
American Embassy has not ordered dependents to leave. International
schools have closed. American consular officials in Chengdu, where
the official residence was burned early Sunday, and in Shenyang
have moved into hotels.
</P>
<P>
   At the American and British Embassies, the government deployed
thousands of troops from the People's Armed Police, a special
anti-riot force under the military, and large contingents remained
in place in the embassy district on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador remained virtually trapped in the
embassy for three days because his security advisers feared what
might happen if he emerged. On Tuesday morning, conditions appeared
to be easing but the ambassador, James Sasser, and other officials
said they would remain inside the embassy until it was clear that
they could safely leave and return.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan telephoned
Sasser. Mr. Tang relayed four demands to ``U.S.-led NATO''
regarding the bombing of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The demands, as described by Chinese authorities, were these: an
``open and official apology'' to China and the victims' relatives;
a thorough investigation; prompt disclosure of the results of the
investigation, and ``to punish severely those responsible for the
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Sasser said he had complained in
return that the state-run news media had not reported that Clinton,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the ambassador himself
had made apologies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, even the most temperate demonstrators insisted that
Clinton had not done nearly enough to atone for the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Passions remained intense as the state-run news media continued
to stoke outrage by calling the bombing an intentional criminal
act. Tuesday's issue of the People's Daily, the Communist Party's
flagship, carried a brief report of NATO leaders' apologies on Page
6. But in a front-page commentary, it called the embassy bombing a
``barbaric crime'' and referred to ``NATO led by the United
States'' as an ``arch criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people spend their evenings avidly watching television news
programs that have shown, for example, wrenching scenes of a
Chinese victim's father in Belgrade sobbing as he handles his dead
daughter's blood-stained quilt.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bombing of the Chinese Embassy, President Jiang
Zemin, who has cultivated closer relations with the United States,
was under strong pressure from the military and the public to take
a stronger stance against the American-led attacks on Yugoslavia,
according to Chinese political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   China announced on Monday that it was suspending its official
dialogue with the United States over human rights and postponing
high-level military contacts and consultations on weapons
proliferation, arms control and international security. No mention
was made of talks on China's entry to the World Trade Organization,
which are at a climactic phase.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy on the Yugoslav
crisis, arrived here on Monday for consultations and was meeting on
Tuesday with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and President Jiang. Russia
and China are the strongest opponents of the NATO air attacks, and
many Chinese now say their country should develop stronger ties
with Russia.

MAKAH INDIAN TRIBE RESUMES GRAY WHALE HUNT AFTER 70-YEAR HIATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE AND MICHAEL BARBER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEAH BAY, Wash. _ For the first time in 70 years, a Makah Indian
stood in the bow of a hand-crafted cedar canoe Monday and threw an
11-foot harpoon at a gray whale.
</P>
<P>
   It missed. But the attempt connected the tribe to roots
stretching back centuries and marked a return to whaling, which has
been banned in the lower 48 states for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt _ much anticipated on the Makah Reservation and much
reviled among animal-rights groups _ will likely continue.
</P>
<P>
   And so will the controversy it has generated. Two protesters
were detained for questioning by the Coast Guard last night after a
confrontation with the Makah whalers on the waters off the Olympic
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe's canoe, known as the ``Hummingbird,'' came close
enough to a gray whale just before 4 p.m. that crewman Theron
Parker threw his harpoon.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters then moved in, encircling the Hummingbird. Their
harassment forced it and an accompanying motor boat to move north,
closer to Neah Bay, to an area where the Coast Guard offered
protection from protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won today. The whales won today because they did not get
one,'' said Jonathan Paul of the protest group, Sea Defense
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the crew returned to Neah Bay empty handed, tribal
leaders are confident of their chances. Migrating grays will be off
the coast for days to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll be swimming around here for another month,'' said John
McCarty, a tribal member and former chairman of the Makah whaling
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe may resume hunting this morning, with protesters again
promising to intervene. But unlike Monday's glassy seas, worsening
weather may postpone the hunt. Gale warnings were posted for the
Strait of Juan de Fuca. Winds off the coast are expected to reach
30 knots, and swells are expected to be 8 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt began Monday, on a calm, warm morning. The boats _ a
specially made canoe hewn from red cedar and an accompanying motor
vessel _ started their hunt about near Ozette, the ancient village
where Makah whale hunts of old began.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters passed Shi-Shi Beach and Father and Son Rock at the
Olympic National Park. Then the tribal crew neared Wedding Rocks,
where Indian hunting parties of centuries past left carvings in
huge boulders. Among the images are whales.
</P>
<P>
   As gray whales neared, six tribal members in Hummingbird paddled
so furiously that they created a wake. Later, they got
reinforcements from the motor vessel, bringing the canoe's crew to
seven. It can hold 11.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby was a vessel from the National Marine Fisheries Service.
A government biologist on board was there to witness the hunt and
to perform a necropsy on the whale.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon, the crew began to stalk yet another gray
whale, trailing the animal as it dived, then came up for air.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:55 p.m., the hunters were practically on top of the whale
as Parker stood and hurled the harpoon. He overthrew the whale but
not by much. It was the crew's best chance of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the afternoon whales glided tantalizingly close to
the canoe, puffing mist into the air as they surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the crew would stop paddling and wait for a whale to
spout, only to be disappointed when it would resurface in an
entirely different direction.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, on a small power boat, crew member Donnie Swan waited in
a wet suit. His job was to dive into the ocean and sew the whale's
mouth shut after it was dead so that it would not sink.
</P>
<P>
   On the same boat was Wayne Johnson, captain of the whalers, who
stood ready to fire a .577-caliber gun to dispatch the whale after
it had been harpooned.
</P>
<P>
   As the hunters worked, the Makah reservation took on a new air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' said tribal Chairman Ben Johnson Jr. ``We
have been waiting a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it would be a good feeling for the Makah to get that
whale and bring it back to shore,'' added McCarty, a member of a
family with a long tradition of whaling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked about our ancestors who through all the years were
whale hunters. That is a missing part of our lives. Now it is part
of our lives again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the hunt continued, people stayed near radio scanners,
waiting for word of success and where the carcass would be hauled.
</P>
<P>
   As word of the hunt spread, the anti-whaling groups also began
to mobilize. Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society
was in Friday Harbor on San Juan Island with his vessel Sirenian.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in Neah Bay aboard the Sirenian last night.
</P>
<P>
   Up the coast were two vessels of the Sea Defense Alliance, which
describes itself as a militant environmental and animal-rights
group. The boats had been waiting outside Neah Bay Monday and
shadowed the tribal motor boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going out there. We were waiting for them,''
said Paul, of the Sea Defense Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The two boats of the animal-right group played a cat-and-mouse
game with the tribe's motor boat until the Coast Guard interceded.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to reports that guns were being brandished aboard the
alliance boats, armed Coast Guardsmen boarded the larger of the two
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Kaetzel, a Coast Guard spokesman, said no guns were found.
But a Coast Guard helicopter observed instances of interfering with
a whaling boat and navigating too closely to another vessel. They
remain under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Paul denied that guns had been brandished and said that the
Coast Guard had detained two of his group's members.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, Clallam County deputies escorted the two
protesters, Jake Conroy of Seattle and Josh Harper of Eugene, Ore.,
to the Coast Guard station at Neah Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The two men were at the station last night, waiting to be
questioned by an FBI agent. Kaetzel said they are under
investigation for possible violations of U.S. laws at sea.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also took the men's inflatable boat and towed it
to Neah Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The protester's largest vessel, the Bulletproof, was joined late
Monday by two inflatable boats from British Columbia. The three
boats circled the canoe and tried to scare off whales.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the Makah whaling crew captain, complained last night
that protesters were ``shooting flares at the canoe, they were
shooting fire hoses at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, tribal police in Neah Bay were preparing to close the
reservation to keep the protesters out, said Lionel Adhunko, tribal
police chief.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribal membership will come down to wherever the whale is
towed in. There will be a ceremony; outsiders will be kept out,''
Adhunko said. ``This is a tribal cultural thing, and that's where
it will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday afternoon, protesters began arriving at Neah Bay,
promising a demonstration Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Should the tribe take a whale it likely will tow it to a
secluded beach. In a ceremony for only tribal members, sacred songs
and dances will be performed. Whaling captain Wayne Johnson will
have the honor of butchering the whale. The first piece he will dry
and decorate. Other choice pieces will go to members of the whaling
crew. Other tribal members will get the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks with large ice chests will ferry the meat into town for
refrigeration. The tribe will produce whale oil by rendering in
dozens of large pots that have been collected over the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Makahs, whose whaling tradition stretches back 1,000 years
or more, ended its hunts in the 1920s when commercial whalers had
devastated the species. But gray whales have rebounded, so growing
in numbers that the U.S. government took them off the endangered
species list in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the International Whaling Commission agreed to let the
Makah Tribe resume whaling. Tribal members can kill up to 20 whales
through the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy that the whaling has caused remains troubling
for some tribal members. McCarty said he had mixed feelings about
the hunt. He was glad the tribe was resuming its tradition, but
worried about the repercussions, including a loss of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are lot of people that are against the Makah
killing the whale _ more than those that support our culture and
our way of life,'' McCarty said. ``I've got mixed feelings whether
it' worth it. As soon as we harpoon that whale and he's dead, our
funding will be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Makah, hunting whales has deep cultural and spiritual
meaning. Whalers were honored members of the tribe, and the act of
hunting, butchering and eating a whale was heaped in ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders saw a resumption of the hunts as a way to
strengthen ties with the past and its cultural values. Besides,
tribal leaders noted, a treaty signed in 1855 reserved the Makahs
right to hunt whales.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe stuck on the northwest corner of the lower 48 states
was all but forgotten for decades. The rest of the world seemed
happy to leave the Makahs isolated and mired in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the world discovered the Makah Tribe. Animal
rights activists gathered outside Neah Bay last summer and for much
of the fall, promising to stop any hunt and, at all costs, protect
the whales.
</P>
<P>
   An intended fall hunt was filled with stops and starts. There
were practice paddles, but never a hunt last. An internal dispute
crippled the crew.
</P>
<P>
   The gray whales migrate up and down the West Coast. Heading for
the Baja in the winter to give birth and Alaska in the summer to
feed. Scientist believe there are 26,600 of the whales.

DODGERS HAVE PLAYERS-ONLY MEETING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A day after left fielder Gary Sheffield said the
Los Angeles Dodgers were too lackadaisical in their approach, they
talked about it.
</P>
<P>
   Before opening a three-game series Monday against the Chicago
Cubs at Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers had a players-only meeting to
discuss what happened _ or didn't happen _ when they lost two of
three games to the lowly Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play better than we are playing right now,'' right
fielder Raul Mondesi said. ``We played what, 30 games? You have to
be 25-5. You compare every player on this team to every player on
other teams, American League or National League. You go position by
position. We have talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers might have superior talent, but they entered Monday
with a 17-14 mark, 1{ games behind the San Francisco Giants in the
NL West.
</P>
<P>
   With high-profile free-agent acquisitions and trades during the
offseason and a payroll near $80 million, expectations called for
the Dodgers to be more than three games above .500 at this point in
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have all the talent we have, that's the way you have to
play,'' Mondesi said. ``You have to win. You have to play better. I
don't care what time (guys) go to sleep, but by the time it's time
to play, they have to be ready to play 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were coming off a 7-2 road trip in which it beat up
the poorest teams in baseball. But the meeting was called after the
Marlins (8-23) won their first series of the season by rallying
from a 4-0 deficit to beat the Dodgers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to play well against the Cubs,'' Dodgers first baseman
Eric Karros said. ``Games against the Marlins are games we let get
away, but you don't dwell on it because you don't want something
like that to snowball.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The optimum roster: Dodgers center fielder Devon White,
bothered by a tight hamstring, all but declared himself out of the
three-game series with the Cubs. He said he couldn't play today and
it didn't make sense for him to play Wednesday because they're off
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson shared that belief, but it leaves the
Dodgers in a difficult spot with only three healthy outfielders.
The injury isn't severe enough to disable White, so utility
infielder Tripp Cromer will double as the emergency outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   This particular plight _ like every other one this season _
seems to stem from bullpen problems.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wants 12 pitchers, which means going with the
usual seven infielders and five outfielders is impossible. The
current spin is that Antonio Osuna can't be used on consecutive
days because of bone spurs in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we need to stay at 12 pitchers with Osuna and the way
it's shaking out,'' Johnson said. ``If we get a good start out of
my left-hander (Carlos Perez today), maybe we can go to 11. Until I
see how much I can get out of Osuna. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to ask me what my optimum balance would be; five
(outfielders), six (infielders), two (catchers) and 12
(pitchers).''
</P>
<P>
   However, with the Dodgers having both Thursday and Monday off,
the bullpen could survive with 11 pitchers. If so, the Dodgers
might think of recalling Trenidad Hubbard from Triple-A
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing good down there, but how do I get him without
going down to 11?'' Johnson said. ``Ideally, you have six
(infielders) and five (outfielders). Until we do something there,
I'm kind of heavy. The way it is now, I'd like to get Trenidad
here. How I can get him here is your guess.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Around the horn: Jose Vizcaino started at shortstop in place
of Mark Grudzielanek. It was Vizcaino's seventh start in the last
eight games. . . . Todd Hollandsworth started for White in center
field. . . . Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa entered the game with seven
homers in the first 28 games. He hit his eighth homer last season
in the Cubs' 42nd game.

GAME 3 LOSS COULD BE JUST WHAT THE STARS NEEDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Figuring out a way to win had become a post-season
habit for the Stars. As of last night, however, they now have
something new to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   How does this team handle losing?
</P>
<P>
   Pavol Demitra of the St. Louis Blues landed an overtime knockout
punch on the Stars. Just under three minutes into sudden death,
Demitra slipped the puck between the goal post and Ed Belfour's
skate, and it was hard to say who celebrated more _ the jubilant
Blues or a capacity crowd of Hull-haters at the Kiel Center.
</P>
<P>
   With this 3-2 bruise for the Stars in Game 3, a second-round
playoff sweat suddenly surfaced. The streak of six consecutive
Dallas postseason victories vanished, and four of those had come
after trailing in the third period. Here's a new thought _ momentum
might even be creeping St. Louis' way.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues make a case when they claim the better team didn't win
Game 2 at Reunion Arena, and the Stars certainly established no
dominance again last night. It could be said the best team did win
Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Ken Hitchcock, who was declaring the series a
draw in the postgame locker room. No, Hitch didn't flunk math. The
Stars are still up two games to one, but he was making a point in
saying ``these are now two evenly matched teams.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in the hockey world believes either Hitchcock's words or
his math, the Stars being heavily favored. But it also seems safe
to assume the Stars' coach has been waiting for a chance to poke at
his team with a sharp stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first two games \Ragainst St. Louis\S, we played just
good enough to win, but tonight that wasn't good enough,'' said
Hitchcock. ``What has to happen next is us taking our game to a
level we haven't approached yet \Rin the playoffs\S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just one thing, or two things _ everything we've got
has to be drastically moved up. That starts with emotion and then
it applies to the whole strength of our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Hitchcock admitted it publicly, but he didn't say
``no'' when asked if last night loss was necessarily a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   The road to the Stanley Cup is all about facing and surviving
pressure. With the Detroit Red Wings looming next, a stern test of
survival against the Blues could either be beneficial, or a
disaster if the series upset happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone expected us to go 16-and-0 in the
playoffs,'' shrugged forward Joe Nieuwendyk, who had his most
docile evening of the playoffs. ``You always hate to lose, but the
real key is to keep the highs of a win in check as well as the lows
of a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Nieuwendyk added the obvious. ``There's no question we've
now got a series going here,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   Any more second periods for Dallas like last night, and it's a
series the Blues will win.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull's homecoming goal on, yes, a power play in the first
period allowed the evening to get away to a nice start. But the 1-0
lead the Stars carried into the second period came under immediate
siege. St. Louis took the game over on both ends of the ice,
blasting away at Belfour. The shot advantage was a massive 16-5 for
the Blues, who somehow managed only the tying goal.
</P>
<P>
   Ever wondered why Jere Lehtinen is considered the best defensive
forward in the NHL? Well, he went out early in the second period
with a knee injury, and didn't return. The Blues noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just hanging on, trying to get that period over
with,'' said Hitchcock. ``Once we got through it, we regrouped and
responded well in the third.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues grabbed a 2-1 lead in the third period, the Stars tied
it with 10:51 left, and another of those bounce-back victories was
looming.
</P>
<P>
   Except this time, the awful power play was too much to overcome.
After the Hull goal, the joke started again about Belfour being
Dallas' best player on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   And this time Nieuwendyk also couldn't ride to the rescue. He
got off one shot in 63 minutes, with Pierre Turgeon getting most of
the defensive applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them credit for playing better defense overall, and
Turgeon had a good game,'' said Nieuwendyk. ``But I didn't think I
was getting any extra attention out there. They limited the good
scoring chances for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And now the Stars have a worry. Tomorrow night we find out if
that's a good thing or a real worry.

DEFENSIVE MISCUES COST RANGERS IN LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The American League West, Rangers manager Johnny Oates
predicted this spring, will be decided by defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers should be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Forget that the Rangers _ who collected a season-high 20 hits in
Sunday's victory in Toronto _ managed only six during their 5-2
defeat last night to the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Defense doomed the Rangers, who gift-wrapped and hand-delivered
the White Sox three runs with three plays not made in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of spring training, I thought we would have a very
alert, defensive-type ballclub,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said. ``For whatever reason _ and it doesn't matter whether it's
hitting, pitching or defense _ it just seems like it comes and
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains why the Rangers _ despite the major leagues'
sixth-highest payroll and a roster loaded with experienced veterans
_ will enter tonight's game only two games above .500 and 1 1/2
games in front of the Oakland Athletics in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that we should be winning more games than
we are,'' said right-hander Rick Helling, who failed to field a
potential double-play ground ball through the middle during
Chicago's two-run fourth inning. ``Games like tonight don't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez negated the second-inning,
bases-empty home run by Chicago's Magglio Ordonez with his
fourth-inning, run-scoring single. Yet, it would be Gonzalez and
Helling (3-4) most responsible for the White Sox's regaining the
lead during the bottom half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The elements played a factor on both occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez misplayed a deep fly ball off the bat of first baseman
Paul Konerko into a leadoff double. The ball carried to the warning
track and _ being hit by a right-handed batter and further aided by
wind _ continued its awkward slice toward the right-field foul
pole.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez struggled not only with the wind, he said, but picking
the ball up off the bat. Otherwise, Konerko's fly ball normally
results in an out. Helling walked Greg Norton during the next plate
appearance before then inducing what appeared to be a double-play
ground ball from left fielder Carlos Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Helling, though, deflected the ball into no-man's land.
Shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt fielded the deflection with no play to
be made anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really saw that ball,'' said Helling, who blamed
Chicago's brisk wind for teary eyes that prevented him from seeing
the ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko scored on a double-play ground ball, and Norton scored
after catcher Brook Fordyce's two-out, two-strike single to right
field.
</P>
<P>
   That was all White Sox right-hander Jaime Navarro (2-3) needed.
Navarro allowed only one run on four hits and one walk during his
best performance this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really been on a roll lately,'' White Sox manager Jerry
Manuel said. ``We're confident that he has arrived and is back to
the form that made him one of the top pitchers in the National
League.''
</P>
<P>
   The seventh inning proved equally gruesome for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago second baseman Ray Durham led off the inning with a
triple, but Helling induced an infield pop-up from shortstop Mike
Caruso to prevent another run.
</P>
<P>
   Helling issued an intentional walk to designated hitter Frank
Thomas to set up a potential inning-ending double play.
Right-hander Tim Crabtree, who relieved Helling, induced the
necessary ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Mark McLemore, though, failed to record one out _
much less two _ after bobbling the ball during the hurried attempt.
Durham scored on what became the Rangers' 10th error during the
past six games. The Rangers entered last night's game ranked 11th
among the league's 14 teams with a .978 fielding percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crabtree came in and did a great job by getting two
double-play ground balls,'' Helling said, ``and we didn't turn
either one.''
</P>
<P>
   The second potential ground-ball double play not turned that
inning did not matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers gave this game away long before then.

OVERTIME FAMILIAR GROUND FOR BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Craig Conroy said he realizes that a loss last night
wouldn't have officially eliminated the Blues from the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He let himself linger on ``officially.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To go down 3-0, after having to come back from down 3-1 last
series, that took all we had,'' Conroy said. ``Then to turn around
and try to come back from down 3-0 against this team ...''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't finish his sentence. In his mind, a loss in Game 3
last night would have been the same as eliminating the Blues.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, with a single flick of his wrist, Blues winger Pavol
Demitra propelled a Blues bunch teetering dangerously close to
elimination back into the series.
</P>
<P>
   His goal 163 seconds into overtime gave St. Louis a 3-2 victory
and sliced Dallas' best-of-seven series lead in half, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be up 2-1, too,'' Blues winger Scott Young said,
echoing a prevailing thought among his teammates that Game 2 had a
chance to be a St. Louis victory.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis has been performing this balancing act throughout the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the Blues' playoff games have gone into overtime,
including Game 2 in this series, a 5-4 Stars' victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've had a lot of exposure to it,'' Blues coach Joel
Quenneville quipped.
</P>
<P>
   They are 3-2 in those games and 1-1 against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overtime games, that's what happens,'' Young said. ``It's a
bounce here, a bounce there. One good play, one good rush. We could
definitely be down 3-0, or up 2-1.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference last night was that players the Blues weren't
necessarily expecting to score did.
</P>
<P>
   Blues center Jochen Hecht scored his first career playoff goal
to give the Blues a 2-1 lead early in the third period. Center Mike
Eastwood scored his first playoff goal this season to tie the game
at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   And Demitra, who had been struggling until coming alive in Game
2, scored again. This time, it was the game winner in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get contributions from every guy,'' Young said.
``There are lots of unsung heroes in the playoffs, and we're
getting that right now and that's why we're successful. Any team
that is successful throughout the playoffs is the team that gets
goals from the fourth line and the third line as well as the first
and second line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen that for two years with Detroit.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he noticed a quieter atmosphere in St. Louis' locker
room before this overtime game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed a little bit quieter,'' he said. ``I don't know if
it's because they came back to tie the game up. The other games we
were facing elimination, so guys were pretty adamant about `No way,
we wanted to get eliminated.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did lose this game, it was almost like an elimination
game. Being down 3-0 to those guys, I think we realized that.''

<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The playoffs officially begin today for the Stars.
Now, they have a challenge to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   After winning six consecutive games to start the playoffs, the
Stars last night were handed a 3-2 overtime defeat at the hands of
the St. Louis Blues. Blues winger Pavol Demitra flicked in a goal
just 2:43 into overtime off a perfect cycle play in which Blues
winger Geoff Courtnall fed Demitra going to the net. It was the
kind of play the Stars have been making in crunch time during the
playoffs _ and the kind of mistake they had been avoiding.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blues were able to turn the tables and close the gap on
the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinals to 2-1 heading into
Game 4 at Kiel Center tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a wakeup call that says the competition
is here,'' Stars center Brian Skrudland said. ``And what it does is
it makes us start saying: We're the team that believes it's the
best, we're the team that's had the best regular-season record for
the past two seasons, we're the team with the expectations and we
need to be the team that relishes those expectations. We're the
team that needs to go after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock also reacted calmly to the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played well at times, and in overtime anything is
up for grabs,'' Hitchcock said. ``We knew this was going to be a
long series. It would have been nice to win this game, it could
have been this close, but we're going to have to rebound and play
even stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   The game was a microcosm of what the series likely will become.
The Stars were dominant in the first period and held the shots to
5-3 in their advantage, taking a 1-0 lead. The Blues were dominant
in the second period and had a 16-5 advantage in that span, tying
the game 1-1. The Stars came back to control much of the third
period, and the Blues dominated the short overtime, getting off
four shots in under three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the Blues dominate when they spring their speedy
forwards through the neutral zone and catch the Stars either taking
chances or simply sleeping _ a sort of fastbreak-style Showtime on
Ice. The Stars, meanwhile, have found an advantage when they slow
the game down and make forced plays to set up the attack in the
offensive zone _ a sort of four corners.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the two sides are smashing heads in deciding who is
going to control the flow of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play their style of game and we have to get away from
that if we want to win,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``We
got a little out of control, a little panicky and have a way of
doing that to us. We can't afford to do that. We have to be more
like we were in the first period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars struck early as they scored for the first time on the
power play in the series and for only the third time in the
playoffs. Brett Hull came out of the penalty box after serving a
bench minor for too many men on the ice (the Blues made it a 4-on-4
with a Chris Pronger high stick) and scored off a Joe Nieuwendyk
feed. Hull, who played for 11 seasons and was returning to Kiel
Center for his first playoff game, was booed heartily for his
second playoff goal and second of the series.
</P>
<P>
   That lead held up as the Blues looked completely out of synch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two great chances right after that, and if we could
have extended it ...,'' Hitchcock said, his voice trailing off.
``Right now, there's just not a lot of difference between the two
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues proved that in the second period as they outshot the
Stars, 16-5, and forced Stars goalie Ed Belfour into some
incredible saves before tying the game on a Mike Eastwood goal. The
Stars lost focus and almost lost the game right there, but stayed
composed enough to force a tie heading into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Blues rookie Jochen Hecht scored at the 4:52 mark of the
third period, and Kiel Center erupted, bringing a surge of energy
back to the series. Sydor made a blind pass that Blues defenseman
Ricard Persson picked off to set up the second goal, and Richard
Matvichuk took himself out of the play on the second goal when he
tried to behead Demitra. Both lapses were uncharacteristic of the
Stars, but showed how they reacted when the tempo and physical play
increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, for a while, we were a little panicky there,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sydor redeemed himself with an outstanding play to tie the
game at the 9:08 mark of the third period. The Stars defenseman
kept the puck in at the point, fed Pat Verbeek for a big shot and
then rushed to front of the net to poke in a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the Stars thought they might have a chance at a
series sweep in overtime. After all, they had won two previous
overtime games in the playoffs and had come back from third-period
deficits on four occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But Demitra ended that with his third goal and his fourth point
in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just playoff hockey, that's just the way it's been for
us pretty much every game these playoffs,'' Langenbrunner said.
``We came up here wanting to win one game and we still have that
opportunity. We've got to come out and play a better game.''

CELEBRITIES THANK KIDS FOR SAYING NO TO DRUGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Unlike a lot of students, the kids at Parkman
Middle School stay late because they're staying out of trouble _
and Evander Holyfield, Johnny Gill and Erik Estrada stopped by to
say thanks.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen celebrities visited the school in suburban Woodland
Hills on Monday during a half-day party, a reward to the students
and volunteers involved in the school's DARE Plus program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out here to congratulate the kids for staying off
drugs,'' said ``Baywatch'' hunk Michael Bergin, who sent the
12-year-old girls swooning with pecks to their cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my own little DARE program growing up with my father,''
who was a state police sergeant in Connecticut, Bergin said. ``That
contributed to my path. Without that, I wouldn't be where I am
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug Abuse Resistance Education has been taught in Los Angeles
schools for many years, but its expansion to an after-school
program began seven years ago, four at Parkman.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the program is that adults lead after-school
activities for the kids, including creative writing, crochet,
ceramics and flag football, as well as giving career and college
advice. The rationale is that if students remain on campus, they
won't be on the street, bored and looking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teachers here are really cool. I learned about snakes and
animals'' in one after-school program, said sixth-grader Connie
Chan, 11.
</P>
<P>
   At the carnival, the school's 1,200 students ran from booth to
booth, shot baskets, played in the batting and pitching cages,
clambered on the inflatable Haunted Slide and listened to blaring
disco and hip hop.
</P>
<P>
   Former ``CHiPs'' star Erik Estrada said he volunteered Monday
because his two sons just completed the DARE program themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like `Just Say No.' They actually get informed,'' he
said. ``The kids are our future. You've got to invest in them.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkman's program, which is serving as a model for other
schools, has 650 students involved. The program uses no tax
dollars, and costs $60,000 a year in donations to operate, said
officials with DARE.
</P>
<P>
   When students use what they learn in their DARE classes to
refuse drugs, alcohol, tobacco and gang membership, ``that's a
victory for society,'' said Glenn A. Levant, DARE America founder.
And the celebrities help show students ``that somebody's
recognizing their silent heroism. The whole world is out there in
support of your being drug-free.''

WILL LAKERS HIT BOTTOM?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Bad mismatches: a 20-acre fire vs. a squirt
gun. Niagara Falls vs. an umbrella. The wind vs. Jimmy Johnson's
hair. Temptation vs. Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And Charles Barkley's rear vs. almost anyone in his way.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley's back-down into the paint is as predictable as Barry
Sanders on third-and-inches. But Sanders gets the first down
anyway, and Barkley's rear-end will inevitably push defenders right
to the hoop for easy buckets, over and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   And so Barkley did Sunday, scoring 12 points in the fourth
quarter and rallying his Houston Rockets in a comeback bid that
fell just short.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Lakers got the victory in Game 1 of this
first-round playoff series, but after Barkley's 25-point game, they
spent much of Monday's practice searching for new ways to put out
forest fires with squirt guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make some adjustments,'' coach Kurt Rambis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, that means more assistance for undersized power
forwards Robert Horry and J.R. Reid, who simply took turns standing
in Barkley's way. Reid fouled out in the effort, showing how futile
it can be to guard the powerfully built Barkley one on one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a freak. He's only 6-6, but he's got a great, low center
of gravity, tremendously strong legs,'' Rambis said. ``He's got an
excellent game. He can hurt you going to the baseline or coming to
the middle. He can step out and hit jumpshots. He's quick off the
dribble, he's got tremendous first-step quickness, and he does a
great job of going after any of his missed shots inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it doesn't matter who you put on him _ he has an offensive
counter to the defensive weaknesses of whoever you have guarding
him.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6-10 each, Horry (235 pounds) and Reid (250) are taller than
Barkley but too lithe to prevent his backdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Horry and Reid) did some things wrong,'' Rambis said, ``but
if anybody had a way to stop Charles Barkley one on one, they would
have come up with it a long time ago. . . . He's basically
unstoppable inside.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Lakers prepared for tonight's Game 2 at the Forum, they
considered the full range of options. When they faced the Rockets
two weeks ago in Houston, they tried frequent double-teams, but the
savvy Barkley is an accomplished passer as well, and he kept
finding Scottie Pippen and Cuttino Mobley for open jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Early in Sunday's game, they sent guards to ``dig'' at Barkley
once he began his move and held him to nine points in the first
half. But the Lakers settled for the one-on-one matchups most of
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   And once Barkley shifts into reverse and starts his banging,
there's little the average man can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not really, you just got to hope that he misses,'' Horry
said. ``You've just got to play him as strong as possible. Really,
what he's doing is an offensive foul, if you want to really look at
it. But you just got to hope that you can hold him off and just try
to contest it.''
</P>
<P>
   What next?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got options,'' Horry said confidently. ``I don't want to
say too much. I'm not going to let y'all get our game plan and have
them read it in the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Late in Sunday's game, the Lakers even tried 330-pound Shaquille
O'Neal on Barkley, but that left Hakeem Olajuwon with easy shots
over shorter defenders.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain players in the NBA who match up with Barkley
but not many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys who are big, strong and long and can move, those are the
guys who are going to have the best chance against him,'' Rambis
said. ``Guys that he's not going to be able to just push underneath
the basket. And whenever he does go up for a shot, they've got long
arms to be able to contest his shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Elden Campbell. The former Lakers power forward was
their best defender against Barkley, but he was traded to Charlotte
along with Eddie Jones for Reid and Glen Rice. No less an authority
than Barkley himself said the Lakers missed Campbell's presence.
</P>
<P>
   Now Barkley says he'll shoot 25 times if he gets single coverage
again. A couple of weeks ago, he literally laughed as he threw
Horry around like a papier-mache mannequin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does that all the time _ any time he can back somebody
down, he laughs,'' Horry said. ``He can laugh all day as long as we
keep winning.''

WHITMAN'S CANDIES LAUNCHES TAKEOVER BID FOR ROCKY MOUNTAIN
CHOCOLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Whitman's Candies Inc., which is owned by
Russell Stover Candies, launched a takeover bid Monday for Rocky
Mountain Chocolate Factory Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's is offering $5.75 a share in cash for Rocky Mountain
Chocolate, which has its headquarters and a candy factory in
Durango, Colo. Rocky Mountain Chocolate has 2.6 million shares
outstanding, making the bid worth about $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Stover and Whitman's would gain a much larger retail
foothold by acquiring Rocky Mountain Chocolate. The Colorado
company has about 230 company and franchise stores _ including one
in Town Center Plaza in Leawood _ in the United States, Canada and
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Stover, which bought Whitman's in 1993, has 50 retail
stores. Most of its sales are through other retailers, such as
discount stores and drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us another channel,'' said Richard Masinton, chief
administrative officer of Whitman's, which shares offices with
Russell Stover in Kansas City. Russell Stover Candies is the
largest seller of boxed chocolates in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The offer expires June 16. Rocky Mountain Chocolate shares
traded at $3.50 Friday and closed Monday at $5.69 a share. Masinton
said Whitman's offer was a 73 percent premium from Rocky Mountain
Chocolate's 30-day average closing price.
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Mountain executives were not available for comment, but
the company announced that it had hired George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in
Kansas City to advise the company of alternatives that would
enhance shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board of directors will carefully review the Russell
Stover offer as well as other alternatives,'' said Frank Crail,
Rocky Mountain's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The unsolicited bid from Whitman's comes after discussions with
Rocky Mountain Chocolate. Two months ago the Colorado company said
it would post less-than-expected earnings because of several
problems. A year ago the company's stock was trading at $7.75 a
share, more than double its Friday close.
</P>
<P>
   The company's executives in March said the disappointing
performance stemmed from problems such as an inadequate supply of
seasonal employees, production inefficiencies, higher-than-expected
shipping costs, and a write-down of the value of spoiled and
excessive supplies because of overproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ward, co-president of Whitman's and Russell Stover, said
the plan for Rocky Mountain would be to focus on its retail stores
and build on the Rocky Mountain brand name of chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said his companies would be able to provide production,
operating and manufacturing efficiencies in support of the Rocky
Mountain stores.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Have you ordered a Pizza Hut delivery?
Checked a Vanguard Airlines flight time? Called for a ZIP code
number from the Postal Service?
</P>
<P>
   Have you tracked an Emery Expedite package? Sought technical
support for your Gateway computer? Checked with H&AMP;R Block about
your Rapid Refund?
</P>
<P>
   Have you paid your Missouri Gas Energy bill by phone? Talked to
a long-distance operator? Ordered out of a Disney catalog?
</P>
<P>
   Use the phone for these reasons _ and many more _ and you've
connected with a call center somewhere in the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   On floors of Midtown office buildings, in suburban office parks
and nestled in industrial sites, more than 100 call centers quietly
have become a big part of the metropolitan economic base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just look at the 21 to 23 largest call centers, we
think you'd find 40,000 employees either working the phones or
providing support services,'' said Wayne Little, vice
president-work force development at the Kansas City Area
Development Council. ``Then you could probably add another 20,000
to 25,000 people with all the customer service phone banks in
smaller settings.''
</P>
<P>
   It adds up to a lot of people enmeshed in an industry that is
both praised _ as clean, rewarding and full of advancement
opportunities _ and maligned _ as high-pressure sweatshops plagued
with turnover _ depending on the work site and the source.
</P>
<P>
   In March this year, organizers convened the first meeting of the
Professional Teleservice Management Association of Greater Kansas
City, a new group of call center managers and directors. One of the
founders, Greg Malmgren, said he was stunned when he compiled a
mailing list of potential members.
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren, who launched an Overland Park office of TeleSource, a
staffing agency aimed at the call center industry, spent months on
proprietary market research to create the list. He tallied 90 call
centers in the metro area, employing anywhere from five persons to
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   To his list it is possible to add another dozen by reviewing
recent news stories about leases and construction announcements for
metro area call centers. Growth announcements occur monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Call centers are growing by leaps and bounds,'' said Jerry
Chappell, owner of ETC Enterprises, a Mission company that places
call centers in rural areas. ``Both inbound and outbound centers
are growing by 20 percent a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The growth of inbound centers is fueled by Internet sales and
customer service fulfillment at countless businesses. Outbound
centers are mushrooming because they're an increasingly
cost-effective way to do direct marketing.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected for a phone-related industry, AT&AMP;T is the
call center giant in the metro area, with nearly 2,000 workers at a
couple of locations.
</P>
<P>
   Employing about 1,500 each at their call centers are Citicorp
Credit Services and Sprint. Citicorp has a big credit card service
center in northwest Kansas City. Sprint has long-distance and local
call centers at 10 locations sprinkled throughout the region _ from
18th and Vine, to Overland Park, to Gardner and Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Other major call center players include Gateway 2000, direct
marketer of personal computers, which employs 1,200 at its Kansas
City call center near Kemper Arena; and ADT Security Services and
American Century Investments, which each have about 900 call center
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent call center growth may have been meteoric, but the job
itself is nothing new. Business has been done over the phone for
years.
</P>
<P>
   At the start-up meeting of the teleservice association, MGE call
center supervisor Karen Johnson won a mug for being the
longest-tenured call center worker in attendance. She has worked in
the local industry for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the branding of call centers as distinct employment entities
really began in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized the specific challenges: technology combined with
recruitment, retention and customer service,'' said Dick Barr,
formerly at Citicorp and now at Vanguard Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was among industry professionals who helped the
Metropolitan Community College's Business and Technology Center
research the local industry before the college system started a
call center training program.
</P>
<P>
   Barr started calling other call center managers a couple of
years ago to meet informally and discuss technology and hiring
issues. His ``users group'' realized that call centers didn't have
a high economic profile despite their employment base.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1994, it was hard to find the words ``call
center'' used in a news story. Now, call centers are an economic
buzzword, a name that sets economic development officials
salivating.
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like about a clean industry that nestles quietly
in any neighborhood and pays decent wages? According to area call
center managers interviewed, pay is averaging nearly $9 an hour to
start, with opportunity for raises, bonuses and career advancement.
</P>
<P>
   Tenured call center workers at some companies are making more
than $17 an hour. Pay is especially good at union shops, where
workers are represented by locals of the Communication Workers of
America or the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pay also is good at call centers where certain professional
skills, such as computer or financial expertise, are required. And,
at the top of the call center hierarchy, some managers and
directors can earn into the six figures at a handful of the biggest
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Still, money isn't the sole motivator for call center growth.
Corporate customer service executives quickly cite the Kansas City
area's appeal to the industry:
</P>
<P>
   - The Central time zone makes it easier to staff call centers to
meet the needs of both East and West coast callers.
</P>
<P>
   - The vaunted Midwestern work ethic lets companies expect and
get higher productivity.
</P>
<P>
   - The relatively well-educated population provides an easily
trainable labor pool.
</P>
<P>
   - Comparatively low-cost commercial and residential real estate
(compared with that in many other large cities) helps attract call
center facilities as well as workers.
</P>
<P>
   - The fairly accent-free Midwest speech is a plus for companies
that want their customer service representatives to be understood
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Aerial Communications ``did extensive market research before
deciding to locate one of its two call centers in Kansas City,''
said Marsha Bjerkan, director of Aerial's call center in Lenexa.
(The other center is in Tampa, Fla.) ``The labor market was so
attractive here, plus the state of Kansas gave us a good incentive
package.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's pluses aren't proof that call centers are perfect
places of employment. In fact, the reputation as high-stress,
desk-bound sweatshops was, at some locations, deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there's a burgeoning ancillary trade in mental health
counseling, book publishing, workplace training and motivational
speaking that feeds off call center stress.
</P>
<P>
   And, like any service trade, call centers are plagued by high
turnover and seasonal ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Malmgren estimated the turnover rates range from as low as 15
percent at some of the better-paying, lower-stress call centers to
as high as 75 percent or more a year at some of the lower-paying
centers that do high-stress telemarketing or collections work.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing turnover is high on priority lists for call center
managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm dead set on keeping people,'' said Scott Crosby of Emery
Expedite. ``I can't afford a revolving door. I will do anything,
try anything, to motivate. We're a 24 by 7. We have to keep a good
staff going.''
</P>
<P>
   ``24 by 7'' is industry jargon for 24 hours a day, 7 days a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Some call centers, such as an in-house one at Hallmark Cards
that supports its network of retailers, operate only during regular
business hours. Others, such as phone companies and some catalog
order businesses, staff around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   The headache of predicting call volume and staffing to meet it
keeps call center managers awake at nights.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there's the matter of the metropolitan area's low
unemployment rate. Finding qualified workers is hard for any
business, much less one that requires accuracy, communication and
computer skills from an entry-level labor pool.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Kansas City area call centers are inbound, not
outbound. Outbound often means telemarketing, which has its own
particular brand of sales quota pressures.
</P>
<P>
   Inbound centers, which receive calls from customers who want
information or service, have stress, too. That stress comes from
both people and technology.
</P>
<P>
   In inbound centers, automated call distributors relentlessly
shoot calls to the next available service representative. You don't
even hear a phone ring. Headsets simply click a warning, and
there's another customer on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Well-managed centers program in off-the-phone time so that
workers aren't fending off a nonstop call barrage for their entire
shift. But the unyielding work pace, and the relative lack of
control over one's daily agenda contributes to worker burnout.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the monitoring of calls by supervisors, which makes
some employees crumple under ``Big Brother is watching'' fears.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing challenge for call center managers and individual
workers is to maintain morale. And that's not easy when workers
have to deal with the public _ a public that may be irate,
frustrated, surly or just plain needy.
</P>
<P>
   To help reduce turnover and provide polite, informed customer
service, the MGE call center is one that in the last few years has
turned to aggressive pre-employment testing of job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   First, the company tested their best call center workers to
learn what personality characteristics correlated with top
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found even-temperament, detail-oriented people who can
follow instructions well and have good people skills and good
communication skills were our top performers,'' said Karen
Czaplewski, MGE vice president-customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the utility screens call center applicants, it does
two rounds of interviewing and administers personality tests to
look for the same attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Talk to tenured call center employees long enough and the
requisite personality is apparent. Ask how they manage to stay
upbeat and on the job, and you'll hear two things:
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't take it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   And, ``I just try to put myself in the customer's shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to relate and never try to prejudge,'' said call
center veteran Aleasha Harris. ``I like people. I like working with
people, and that makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Well-run call centers run contests, give out frequent awards and
have various bonus programs to keep enthusiasm up. And to cut the
stress, some make a point to program in fun.
</P>
<P>
   At a Sprint call center in Lenexa, it's time for a fun break
when the lights go off, the mirrored ball starts flashing from the
ceiling and the music cranks up. That's when people get up from
their desks and do a chicken dance in the aisles.

KANSAS CITY AREA COUPLES IN CHINA TO ADOPT BABIES AMID
INTERNATIONAL CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GRAHAM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A joyous journey to China took an uncertain
turn for two Kansas City area couples after errant NATO bombs
struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Kim Tucker of Leawood made the trip to adopt a baby
and enjoy some vacation time. So did Damon and Joyce Sickel of
Kearney, along with 12 other families adopting through Children's
Hope International, based in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   One-year-old babies _ Jasmine for the Sickels and Lili Gwynne
for the Tuckers _ are safely in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   But for three days, they have waited for the flight home while
confined to their hotel under police orders. Outside their windows,
protesters chant and burn American flags. The White Swan Hotel
adjoins the U.S. Embassy on a small island in the southern coastal
city of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we heard about it (the bombing), we knew it would be a
problem,'' Joyce Sickel, 39, said in a telephone interview Monday.
``We were frightened because we didn't know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The couples arrived in China on April 29, traveling together
like a tour group.
</P>
<P>
   Their day of joy was May 4, when babies from four orphanages
were presented to new parents in a town west of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday night they arrived in Guangzhou to get visas for
their babies to enter the United States. Early Saturday, they just
had time to get medical checks and photos for visas at a building
near the hotel. Then busloads of protesters began arriving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a little unsettling,'' Sickel said. ``I don't think
we're frightened or scared, because the hotel security and military
police are outside our doors. But it makes you feel uneasy, and you
just want to get home.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Swan is a luxury hotel with stores and restaurants.
Couples have been able to shop, dine and even swim at the pool.
</P>
<P>
   But some were looking forward to experiencing China outside the
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the part of the trip where the vacation was supposed
to kick in,'' said Scott Tucker, 37.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's been peeking out the window and videotaping the
protests. They appear to be well-orchestrated, he said, with neatly
dressed students carrying well-made signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable that this happened to us,'' Tucker said.
``There's no way you could prepare for it. Of all the embassies to
be hit (by a bomb), it's very surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   Police in riot gear have kept the crowd under control without
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Embassy officials went to the hotel to finish the processing so
the couples could leave on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The families plan to ride from the hotel to the airport today on
a tour bus, probably with the curtains drawn, Sickel said. They
expect to arrive in Kansas City late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker said they'll be happy to escape the protests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disturbing,'' he said. ``It's concerned us
greatly.''

KANSAS CITY GIVING MIXED WELCOME TO SCATTERED-SITE PUBLIC HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH E. IGOE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Donna Nagy knew it
was her dream home: bright gray paint, maroon shutters and a
spacious two-car garage. Not to mention the backyard deck.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Then there was the interior: three bedrooms, two bathrooms and
an airy living room.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband now pay about one-fourth of their income for
rent. Their landlord is the Housing Authority of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Their home is not the stereotypical picture of public housing.
Homes like Nagy's are dubbed scattered sites, in contrast to
old-style public housing projects.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Kansas City authority is in the midst of its biggest
expansion of scattered site housing.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, the authority will use federal money to buy or build
nearly 300 homes. The $27-million effort will reshape Kansas City's
public housing landscape, placing duplexes, townhouses and homes in
many neighborhoods that have never seen public housing.
</P>
<P>
   That angers some current residents who think poor families could
ruin property values, increase crime and crowd school districts. On
Monday, one Northland neighborhood won a preliminary injunction
against a builder whom they have accused of erecting cheap
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules limit scattered sites' location. They can't go,
for example, in flood plains, noisy areas around airports or in
poor and minority neighborhoods. Those rules prevent clumping poor
people together in second-rate sites.
</P>
<P>
   National studies have shown that scattered site housing does not
harm neighborhoods, said Philip Olson, a sociologist who heads
University of Missouri-Kansas City's urban affairs program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also helps those families moving from an assisted situation
toward independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagy is proud of her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's provided a great deal of dignity,'' said Nagy.
``Most people in your neighborhood don't have a clue that you are
in a scattered site.''  &LR; brk:Magnet for trouble
</P>
<P>
   Like other cities, Kansas City had its troubled public housing
projects that became havens for crime and drugs. Today the city's
public housing stock is being whittled down, overhauled and
scattered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the authority toppled Wayne Miner's high-rise towers,
leaving low-rise townhouses. Where Pennway Plaza's walk-up
apartments once languished is Villa Del Sol, a mix of apartments
and townhouses catering to both public housing tenants and buyers.
Guinotte Manor is being redeveloped into brightly painted
townhouses and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the authority pared down the number of dwellings
to create a more attractive environment and reduce the number of
residents. But that caused the authority's waiting list to
increase: 4,000 people are waiting for public housing and 9,000 are
in line for federal rent subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   As Kansas City replaced the projects, the federal government
provided the local agency with money for new scattered sites.
efforts misfired. ]
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, authority officials bought about 180 scattered
site homes. Many were dilapidated and located in poor central-city
areas. Some neighborhoods protested the authority's moves and, in
several cases, staved off similar purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The authority's new manager, TAG Associates Inc., razed 20 of
the worst properties. Renovations, including the removal of lead
paint and asbestos, continue on all others.
</P>
<P>
   TAG tapped a Chicago developer, The Habitat Co., to put the
languishing federal money to work.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Habitat has acquired 140 sites and has built 34 duplexes
in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; brk:Neighbors unhappy
</P>
<P>
   Some neighborhoods have concerns about public housing in their
communities.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northland's Maple Park, the authority is planning one of
its largest developments, a total of 30 single-family duplexes and
townhouses. The authority also is building two other duplexes in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   During Habitat's first community meeting with 50 residents, some
had harsh words. Others walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Park President Pat Hosler wonders why her neighborhood
will include about 15 percent of the city's new scattered sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not fair,'' she said, noting that about 30 percent of
the 1,200 Maple Park homes are already rental. ``People are
generally concerned about crime going up with that many more
rentals in one area.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Northland neighborhood, Coves North, won a temporary
restraining order against a builder who is constructing six
prefabricated modular duplexes. In court Thursday, neighbors
protested the duplex construction plan in an area where home prices
start about $160,000. Neighborhood leaders said the builder had
misrepresented his plans.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a Platte County Circuit Court judge issued a
preliminary injunction against the builder. That case will either
be settled or go to trial before the builder can continue.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Ed Ford, who heads the city planning committee,
shares some concerns. In cases like Maple Park and Coves North,
Ford thinks Habitat is locating too many low-income families
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scattered site housing should be just that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is helping neighborhoods like Maple Park work on compromises
such as reducing the number of public housing tenants and mixing
them with paying residents. Another of Ford's concerns is that
Habitat, in its search for quality, is limiting itself only to new
homes, which reduces areas for scattered site homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Lines, president of TAG Associates, Inc., said the
authority is working with neighborhoods by placing houses and
duplexes in areas already zoned for them, something the law does
not require it to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be a good neighbor,'' Lines said.
</P>
<P>
   The authority hired political consultant Jim Bergfalk to mediate
with concerned neighborhoods. Many fears are exaggerated, he said,
or spring from a NIMBY _ Not In My Back Yard _ attitude. He said
he's trying to ``take the fuel out of the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the housing authority is working with the midtown
Coleman Highlands neighborhood to build two houses on an empty
tract at 33rd Street and Southwest Trafficway. Local activists tout
their 95 percent owner-occupancy rates among the stone-accented
houses that make up their 16-block neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly embrace the concept of diversity _ socio-economic
diversity and racial diversity _ but there are concerns,'' said
Mimi Moffat, a resident attorney who represents the community.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the last 15 years have spent time and money
fixing their houses,'' Moffat said. That's an effort they are not
sure public housing tenants could match, she said.  &LR; brk:Question of
design
</P>
<P>
   Because Coleman Highlands is a historic area, the Landmarks
Commission has to approve Habitat's designs..MDNM/ During the past
year, Habitat officials, architects and neighborhood leaders have
worked together on home designs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've redrawn their plans several times,'' said neighborhood
president Joyce Williams. ``Everything they are coming up with is
drawn off another home.''
</P>
<P>
   Moffat said neighbors are warming to public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooperating with a project would be good for what a lot of us
like to yak on about, that: `Westport is good for diversity,' ''
Moffat said. ``It would be hypocritical when it comes down to the
crunch to say: `NIMBY, NIMBY, NIMBY.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the Northland, Nagy is planning a vegetable garden in her
back yard, a flower bed out front. She thinks complaints about
public housing tenants represent unfair stereotypes of the poor. To
qualify for her home, Nagy must pass annual reviews that show she
is an ambitious tenant who properly cares for her home.
</P>
<P>
   Someday soon, Nagy hopes she and her husband can pay their own
mortgage. For now, her children focus on getting good grades. Her
husband, Paul, continues to look for a permanent teaching job.
Nagy, who works at one of TWA's ticket counters, hopes for a
promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Said Nagy: ``I have my whole future ahead of me.''

JURY AWARDS $9 MILLION TO MAN; FACE DESTROYED BY DUMBWAITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo _ A Jackson County jury on Monday awarded more
than $9 million to a former Kansas City man whose face and one eye
wre torn off by a falling dumbwaiter.
</P>
<P>
   The dumbwaiter fell on Johnnie Lay, 50, as the elevator
repairman worked on it Sept. 30, 1992. Jurors on Monday found
Schindler Elevator Corp. of St. Louis liable for not installing a
safety device with the dumbwaiter at the Hyde Park Nursing Home,
401 E. 36th St.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors awarded $15 million in damages but found Lay one-third at
fault. That third and settlements from two other companies were
subtracted, leaving a verdict of about $9.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Helling, a doctor at St. Luke's Hospital, testified that Lay
did not bleed to death because he stayed conscious, sat upright and
held his face on. Helling said it was among the greatest acts of
courage he had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   Lay's attorney, James D. Walker Jr., reminded jurors in closing
arguments Monday of that testimony. He also told them to remember a
plastic surgeon who said Lay's facial injuries were the worst he'd
seen on a living human being.
</P>

 Alternative version of Kansas science standards to be discussed  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE BEEM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ When Kansas Board of Education member Steve
Abrams called John Staver to Topeka two weeks ago, Staver thought
they were going to iron out some problems with proposed science
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Abrams gave Staver, who helped write the standards, a
91-page revision.
</P>
<P>
   And although Abrams' version was written by ``various
citizens,'' including the Missouri president of a creation science
group, the only names on the revision are those of Staver and the
26 other members of the state committee that wrote the original
document.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams sees his revision as one of many since the committee
began writing the standards more than a year ago. But science
committee members say Abrams' revision substantially changed a
document that was based on guidelines from national science
associations.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' version would change the definition of science,
eliminate all but one reference to evolution and add a definition
of creation as ``the idea that the design and complexity of the
design of the cosmos requires an intelligent designer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that my name is on it,'' said Steve Case, a
member of the standards committee who sits on the faculty at the
University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's standards list evolution as a cornerstone of
science. Without an understanding of evolution, students cannot
succeed in the life sciences, the standards writers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Abrams didn't agree, and on Wednesday he'll present his
revision to the other board members. Today, the board will hear
public comment on the science standards.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed standards are the result of a state board order in
1997 to spell out what students should learn at various grade
levels. The board and the state education commissioner appointed
the 27-member committee to write the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Staver, director of the Center for Science Education at Kansas
State University, said the committee decided at its first meeting
to base the new standards on national guidelines from the National
Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Those national standards, developed over four years, were
reviewed and critiqued by 22 science organizations. About 18,000
persons signed off on the national standards before they were
accepted, Staver said. Those standards present evolution as a major
component of science.
</P>
<P>
   ``That national consensus gives the national standards a very
special kind of credibility,'' Staver said.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the science committee thought. But Abrams
wasn't satisfied that the new state science standards represented
the best kind of science.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams, a veterinarian from Arkansas City, said science is
something that is ``observable, measurable, repeatable and
falsifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a standard for theories of science for hundreds of
years,'' Abrams said. ``If it's not repeatable, it doesn't do any
good.''
</P>
<P>
   For Abrams, macro-evolution _ one species of animal changing
into another as it adapts to its environment _ can't be observed,
measured, repeated or falsified. (Something that can be falsified
can be proved or disproved by scientific experiment).
</P>
<P>
   So when Cass County resident Tom Willis approached Abrams with a
revision of the state standards, Abrams took a look.
</P>
<P>
   Willis, president of the Creation Science Association for
Mid-America, said he and about two dozen other people evaluated the
proposed state science standards and found them lacking. He
declined to name his co-authors.
</P>
<P>
   Willis said he and his co-authors couldn't present new standards
to the state board; that's where Abrams came in. When Abrams saw
Willis' document, it was in its second draft. Abrams said he helped
the writers edit and present the document in the proper format.
</P>
<P>
   Willis said the state committee's version and Abrams' revision
are quite different, but Abrams describes the changes as slight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the differences:
</P>
<P>
   - The committee's version lists five ``unifying concepts'' of
science: systems, order and organization; evidence, models and
explanation; constancy, change and measurement; form and function;
and evolution and equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams' revision removed the unifying concepts and added three
areas of science: technology, theoretical science and historical
science.
</P>
<P>
   - The committee's version defines science as ``the human
activity of seeking natural explanations for what we observe in the
world around us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Abrams' revision, science is defined as something that can be
repeated in the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   - The glossary of the committee's version defines evolution, in
part, as ``a scientific theory that accounts for present day
similarity and diversity among living organisms and changes in
non-living entities over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The glossary of Abrams' version describes evolution as
permutations that occur within a species, with the caveat that some
evolutionary changes can be demonstrated and some cannot.
</P>
<P>
   The board that will take up the standards on Wednesday is
divided along ideological lines, with five moderate members and
five conservatives. The two sides have deadlocked on several issues
in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate member Janet Waugh of Kansas City, Kan., said she had
no idea Abrams was working on a revision.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Bill Wagnon, a moderate from Topeka. Wagnon said
that after he received Abrams' version of the standards, the two
talked. Wagnon said he was trying to persuade Abrams to uphold the
commitment he made two years ago when the science committee was
appointed.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, board members each chose a committee member to
represent their views, with the rest appointed by the education
commissioner. If the board can't trust its own committees, the
process fails, Wagnon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Abrams is searching for a sixth vote,'' Wagnon said. ``I hope,
if he can't find it, he will encourage others to vote for the
committee's standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Holloway, a Shawnee conservative who is chairwoman of the
state board, said she was unsure what would happen if state board
members voted to accept Abrams' version over the science
committee's standards. The board is scheduled to vote in June on
the new standards.

NEW MISSOURI PROGRAM ALLOWS FAMILIES TAX BREAKS FOR COLLEGE
SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Starting in August, a Missouri program will
allow residents of any state to set aside up to $8,000 a year for
college expenses, with state and federal tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Money invested in the Missouri Higher Education Savings Program
would be exempt from state taxes. Federal taxes would be deferred
until it was time to pay college bills _ and even then, the money
would be taxed at a lower student rate, said Missouri Treasurer Bob
Holden, speaking at Penn Valley Community College on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advanced education beyond high school is a resource we should
want to make more available to our young people,'' said Holden.
``Missouri must make the 13th and 14th years of education
commonplace for young Missourians to build the skills they need to
compete in the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the program will be based in Missouri, residents of any
state can participate. They just need $25 to open an account.
</P>
<P>
   Holden announced Monday that a nationally known
financial-services company would manage the fund _ the Teachers
Insurance and Annuity Association College Retirement Equities Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's fund, which legislators approved last year, follows
the lead of other states that wanted to encourage families to begin
saving for college when their children are young.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's Higher Education Savings Program allows the money to
be used for tuition, room and board, books, and other educational
costs at any college or university in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The money can be spent on a different student than the one for
whom it initially was intended. It also can be refunded without
penalty if a child receives a scholarship, dies or becomes
disabled. Spending the money on anything other than educational
expenses would result in a tax bill and a 10 percent IRS penalty.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the savings program, see the state
treasurer's Web site at www.sto.state.mo.us. A toll-free telephone
number for the program will be set up in the next few days, Holden
said.

 FEINSTEIN CONDEMNS BOMBING OF EMBASSY  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., lashed out Monday
against NATO's accidental bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade, calling for a temporary halt to allied air attacks on
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein, a long-time and vocal supporter of greater U.S.
openness toward China, first strongly condemned the stray attacks
during a radio interview, saying she thought ``the mission ought to
be brought to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein later issued a much more restrained press release that
criticized NATO ``errors'' but reiterated her earlier position that
``our cause in this conflict is just and that our resolve must
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein spokesman Howard Gantman said the comments used from
the radio interview ``are not inaccurate, but the senator wanted to
really show exactly what are the issues for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Gantman said Feinstein spoke with National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger Monday to urge the administration to ``reassess their
procedures in targeting and intelligence before moving ahead with
intensive bombing in urban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   During the interview with KCBS radio, Feinstein said, ``I don't
believe you can win wars by tossing bombs around like popcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm beginning to get very concerned about how this campaign is
being carried out,'' Feinstein added. ``It seems to be right now
just about how much destruction we can create.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy bombing has sparked violent anti-American street
protests in Beijing _ with tacit support from the Chinese
government _ and has also damaged U.S.-China relations on several
critical fronts.
</P>
<P>
   China has broken off talks on human rights and arms control, and
a raft of valuable trade concessions China offered in an effort to
gain entry to the World Trade Organization are now in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In her press release, Feinstein said she had ``very serious
concerns'' about ``flaws in intelligence and bombing procedures.
These have taken far too many innocent lives and caused far too
much collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein added a strong condemnation of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's attacks on the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ``has expressed the nation's deep regrets''
for the embassy bombing, Feinstein said, ``but he also rightfully
pointed out that the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo _ which has led to
the killing of thousands of people, the use of rape as an
instrument of war, and the relocation of over 600,000 people _ is
an ongoing, deliberate and systematic crime.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Chronicle interview April 12, when the NATO air war was
just a few weeks old, Feinstein was strongly supportive, ticking
off the number of air sorties run, the percentages of Yugoslavia's
oil refining and ammunition production that had been destroyed and
the number of clear nights that allied pilots had experienced.
</P>
<P>
   But Feinstein also is an ardent supporter of China, having
forged closer ties to the Chinese government than perhaps any other
U.S. politician. Feinstein has cultivated a personal relationship
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin that dates back to the early
1980s, when the two met as mayors of ``sister cities'' San
Francisco and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   She has met with Zemin many times over the years, once making a
personal appeal to Zemin on behalf of Tibet's Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., who has opposed the NATO air war
from the beginning, also condemned the embassy bombing Monday,
saying, ``Massive bombing raids are a morally unacceptable way of
achieving peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee said war ``is defined in part by its collateral damage'' and
that the Chinese Embassy bombing ``is particularly upsetting''
given China's veto power in the United Nations Security Council,
which could oversee a potential peace settlement between NATO and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the utter failure of the NATO bombing strategy,'' Lee
said, ``there can be no question that our best hope for peace and
stability in Yugoslavia is the negotiation of an immediate
cease-fire.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
No lefthanded starting pitcher has shut down the Astros all season,
but manager Larry Dierker concedes his club would have trouble if
forced to face Mike Hampton.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday night, it paid to have the crafty lefthander on the
Astros' side.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton pitched a five-hit shutout, helping the Astros snap a
two-game losing streak with a 6-0 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (4-1) struck out seven and walked none to win his fourth
consecutive decision. The Astros provided plenty of offense,
breaking open a one-run game with five runs off former Astro Pete
Schourek in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hampton would have been pitching against us, we would have
had trouble scoring the way he was pitching,'' Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates surely agree. All five of Pittsburgh's hits were
singles, and they had two in the same inning just once.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the fifth that the Pirates hit a ball in the air
out of the infield. Hampton retired 19 of the final 23 batters he
faced and seemed to get stronger as the game went on, striking out
four of the last six batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty comfortable out there, and the team was scoring
some runs behind me, which is always a key,'' said Hampton, whose
last shutout was in April 1998 against the New York Mets. ``I'm in
a groove. The good thing is getting ahead in the count and getting
them to hit my pitch. I didn't make too many mistakes over the
middle of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, who notched his fifth career shutout, has allowed just
three earned runs in his last 24 innings (1.13 ERA).
</P>
<P>
   And what better timing than with the Astros having just lost two
in a row to the Montreal Expos? Hampton has been the Astros'
streak-buster this season, with the club winning six of his seven
starts _ all in games following a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The complete game was the Astros' third this season. Hampton
also went 1-for-3 with a double to raise his average to .286.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always good,'' Pirates manager Gene Lamont said. ``He had
a real good cutter. He knows what he's doing and changed speeds
real well. He does everything _ an overpowering pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton benefited from three double plays and forced the Pirates
into 14 groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Monday, Pittsburgh had won seven of its last nine
games, including three of four over the weekend in St. Louis. In
those nine games, the Pirates hit .320 with 21 doubles and 12 home
runs while averaging 7.5 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who pitched for the Astros last season before being
traded to Boston, became the latest lefthander to have trouble
against the Astros, who are a National League-best 8-2 against
lefthanded starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no explanation,'' Dierker said. ``I remember two years
ago, everybody was wondering what was wrong with us that we
couldn't hit lefthanders. We had a lot of good righthanded hitters
(then) and weren't hitting them very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek (1-3), celebrating his 30th birthday, held the Astros
to one run in the first four innings before unraveling in the
fifth, when the Astros sent 10 batters to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek allowed six runs, nine hits and five walks in four
innings, tying his shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 1-0, the Astros got five hits, five runs and three walks
in the fifth inning off Schourek and reliever Brad Clontz.
</P>
<P>
   After a leadoff walk to Jeff Bagwell, the Astros reeled off five
consecutive hits to chase Schourek. Ken Caminiti, who went 3-for-5,
doubled, and Richard Hidalgo, Tony Eusebio and Tim Bogar followed
with RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Barker, who celebrated his 28th birthday Monday with two
hits and his first start in center field, singled off Clontz to
load the bases. Craig Biggio and Derek Bll drew consecutive walks
to force in two more runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game can be very humbling, so I'll take what I can get,''
said Caminiti. ``I'll take my hits, and hopefully I'll get some
power numbers pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell's sixth homer of the year put the Astros ahead 1-0 in the
third. He is a lifetime .464 hitter (11-for-24) against Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   While the Astros were providing Hampton with plenty of offense,
Schourek continued to starve.
</P>
<P>
   For the seventh time this season, the Pirates failed to score
more than four runs for him. Pittsburgh has scored 19 runs total in
Schourek's seven starts and just seven runs with him in the game.

MONDESI LIFTS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers held a team meeting before
opening day and Raul Mondesi hit a pair of homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers held a team meeting before Monday's game with the
Chicago Cubs and Mondesi hit a pair of homers.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Mondesi's homers came with a runner on base and, coupled
with right-hander Ismael Valdes' six innings, gave the Dodgers a
4-3 win against the Cubs at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Dodgers should schedule a few more meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi leads the Dodgers with 11 homers and 27 RBI. It's the
10th time in his career and second occasion this season in which
he's hit two home runs in a game. Both came off Cubs right-hander
Steve Trachsel, who fell to 1-4.
</P>
<P>
   The players-only meeting was called after the Dodgers lost two
of three to baseball's doormat, the Florida Marlins, over the
weekend, after which left fielder Gary Sheffield said the team was
lackadaisical.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi tried to breathe life into the Dodgers in the second
inning when he walked and stole second, but he was stranded there.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Mondesi made sure there was no way he'd
remain on the bases. Sheffield singled with one out and Mondesi hit
Trachsel's second pitch to right-center to give the Dodgers a 2-1
lead. Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa barely moved when the ball was
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The only offense the Dodgers were getting was from Mondesi, and
he was also the only threat. He gave the Dodgers a 4-1 lead in the
sixth when he smashed a Trachsel fastball over the left-field
fence. Ahead in the count 1-2, Trachsel tried to throw a fastball
low and away. Instead, it was belt high and down the middle. They
were Mondesi's first homers since May 1 at Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs scored a run in the seventh off reliever Alan Mills.
Mark Grace walked with one out and scored on Henry Rodriguez's
double to the left-center-field wall. But Mills struck out Benito
Santiago and got Tyler Houston, who homered early, to ground meekly
back to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Mills got out of trouble in the eighth when Lance Johnson lined
to second baseman Eric Young, who, in turn, doubled pinch-hitter
Curtis Goodwin off first.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw then pitched the ninth for his eighth
save but had to withstand a Cubs rally. Mark Grace singled with two
outs, moved to second and scored on Rodriguez's single to right;
however, Shaw struck out Santiago to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   Following a splendid road trip in which the Dodgers went 7-2,
they put forth an awful showing against the Marlins, losing two of
three. The team meeting seemed to have an effect on the crispness
of the Dodgers' play.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cubs took an early 1-0 lead when Houston led off the
second inning with a homer to center field. Valdes spent his six
innings getting out of trouble, but Houston's second homer of the
season was the only run the Cubs got off the starter.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed nine hits and walked three. The Cubs had a pair of
baserunners in four of Valdes' six innings and even had three hits
in the fourth inning. In the first inning, Valdes got Santiago to
ground into a fielder's choice with the bases loaded. In the
fourth, Valdes juggled, then caught, Jose Hernandez's liner and
doubled Houston at first. Trachsel singled and Johnson doubled, but
Valdes struck out Mickey Morandini to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros provided a defensive gem in the sixth
to protect the Dodgers' 2-1 lead. Houston and Hernandez singled to
begin the inning and after Trachsel's fielder's choice, Karros made
a diving stop on Johnson's grounder along the first base line, then
raced to the bag for the second out. Morandini flew to center for
the third out.
</P>
<P>
   In a workmanlike six innings, Valdes threw 121 pitches.

<P>
   PHOENIX - International Speedway Corporation, which purchased
Phoenix International Raceway nearly two years ago, added to its
growing empire on Monday by reaching a merger agreement with Penske
Motorsports Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Penske holdings include Michigan Speedway, California Speedway,
Nazareth (Pa.) Speedway, North Carolina Motor Speedway and a 45
percent interest in Miami-Homestead Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Upon completion of the transaction, ISC, which already owns 12
percent of Penske Motorsports, will acquire the remaining 88
percent, giving it 14 of 34 races on the NASCAR Winston Cup
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ISC also owns or operates Daytona (Fla.) International Speedway,
Talladega (Ala.) Superspeedway, Darlington (S.C.) Raceway, Watkins
Glen (N.Y.) International and Tucson Raceway Park.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ISC is building racetracks in Kansas City and near
Chicago and is looking at the New York and Denver markets as

GARCIAPARRA BURIES M'S WITH THREE HOMERS, 10 RBI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As Nomar Garciaparra's second grand slam and third home
run sailed into the Boston sky Monday night, Mariners left fielder
Brian Hunter motioned with his arm to the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to convince umpires the drive was foul, just as
Carlton Fisk tried to will his ball fair in the 12th inning of the
sixth game of the 1975 World Series. Fisk's effort succeeded.
Hunter's did not. He knew better, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flipping through the channels (Sunday) night, and one of
the reporters said he was getting hot,'' Hunter said of
Garciaparra. ``I thought, he's not the guy you want to be getting
hot, because he can do that at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Garciaparra did at Fenway Park in the Mariners' 12-4
loss to the Boston Red Sox has few historical precedents. The
shortstop became only the 11th player in baseball history to hit
two grand slams in the same game. His 10 runs batted in were one
shy of the American League record, and the most in any game since
Mark Whiten's record-tying 12 RBI on Sept. 7, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   And it was the first three-homer game in Garciaparra's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I waited to the big leagues to do it,'' he said. ``I
never did it, not even in Little League.''
</P>
<P>
   As extraordinary as the performance was, the Mariners have seen
another like it. Last month, they allowed nine RBIs to Ivan
Rodriguez of the Texas Rangers in a 15-6 loss.
</P>
<P>
   This loss was Seattle's fourth in six games on an eight-game
road trip against three of the AL's playoff teams from last year.
It prompted manager Lou Piniella to refuse post-game interview
requests for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., however, said something Piniella
likely was thinking.
</P>
<P>
   What was most amazing to him about Garciaparra's night?
</P>
<P>
   ``All the people that were on for him,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners walked eight Red Sox last night. In their past five
games they have walked 38, and never less than seven. Over that
span, 15 walks _ an average of three a game _ have turned into
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra victimized two of the five rookies on Seattle's
staff. Brett Hinchliffe (0-2) allowed the first two homers, Eric
Weaver the third. Hinchliffe, recalled from Class AAA Tacoma to
make his third big league start, allowed singles to the first two
batters of the game. He got ahead of designated hitter Brian
Daubach, 1-and-2, then hit him with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That brought up Garciaparra, who drilled a high fastball into
the right-field bullpen for his first grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Daubach hit a leadoff double and Garciaparra lined
a hanging slider down the right-field line. Fenway's 302-foot right
field is the shortest distance in baseball, but Garciaparra had it
by 8 feet for his second blast. Troy O'Leary followed with a homer,
and Hinchliffe allowed two walks and a single before departing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this league or any league, you can't make bad pitches, and
they hit them hard,'' said Hinchliffe. ``We scored in the first,
and I need to go out there and throw a shutout inning. The way I'm
throwing, I don't deserve to pitch in this or any league.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... You say it can only get better, but it keeps getting
worse. I have too good stuff to give up runs like that. I believe
in my ability, but I've got to make pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Hinchliffe and Freddy Garcia were the most impressive Mariner
pitchers in spring training, lending hope that the Mariners'
pitching staff, while young, might turn out all right. Seattle now
has a 6.54 ERA, the highest in baseball, and Hinchliffe has
surrendered eight home runs in 152/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring training's a different story _ players aren't in shape
yet, and you can't let spring training (performance) fool you,''
said pitching coach Stan Williams. ``He got the ball up, and if you
pitch that way, you're going to get hit. I thought he had a good
warm-up, his attitude was real good, all-business. But he got the
ball up; these are professional hitters, and they hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox couldn't do much with Ken Cloude _ 42/3 innings, one
hit _ but they hurt Weaver, too. With one on and one out, he walked
Valentin and Daubach to get to Garciaparra. Williams came to the
mound for a conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked on the mound, and he said, `Listen, start him with a
slider and then bust him in,''' Weaver said. ``Then I threw him a
spinner right there. I'm sure the guy's swinging great right now,
and if you give him a gift like that, I'm sure he's not going to
miss it. It doesn't matter if he already had two home runs or not _
he's not going to miss a pitch like that.''
</P>
<P>
   If only Weaver had known Garciaparra's game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have swung at anything, if it was 10 feet
over my head or in the dirt,'' said Garciaparra, who has five
homers in his past 22 at-bats after starting the season homerless.
``There was a lot of energy going on. It was kind of neat. I just
wanted something good to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Very little good was happening for the M's, who now have lost
consecutive games started by a reliever, the Yankees' Mike Stanton,
and a pitcher with an 8.06 ERA, Boston's Pat Rapp. Rapp was lifted
with the bases loaded and nobody out in the third, and John Mabry
cut Boston's lead to 4-2 with an RBI force out. But Russ Davis
struck out and Mabry was caught stealing in a rundown, ending the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Three innings later, off winner John Wasdin, Dan Wilson flied to
shallow right with Davis on first. Darren Lewis caught it, then
looked shocked to see Davis well off the bag. He threw to first for
the double play as Davis scrambled back, too late.

CZECH JOB AWAITING REICHEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX -  &UR; Robert Reichel apparently has a standing offer to
join the Czech Republic national team as a player/coach, with a
chance eventually to run the elite program in his native country.
</P>
<P>
   According to his agent, it's a position the upcoming free-agent
center might decide to accept regardless of how much money the
Coyotes offer him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Coyotes announced that right wing  &UR; Shane Doan
will play for Team Canada in the World Championships in Norway.
Doan, 22, who scored two game-winning goals for Phoenix during its
first-round playoff loss to St. Louis, will be available for
semifinal games Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As for Reichel, Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith said Monday
he was willing to send a lucrative, multiyear contract offer to the
27-year-old Reichel, whose 69 points were second-most on the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Robert makes up his mind he's going to play in the Czech
Republic next year, well, he's playing in the Czech Republic next
year,'' Smith said. ``If he wants to play in the NHL, we will make
him an offer and see if we can get a deal done. If he says to me,
`Look, Bob, this isn't about money, it's about family and I'm going
back home,' then that's the risk we took when we acquired him, and
we'll go on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Reichel, obtained from the New York Islanders prior to the NHL
trading deadline, is vacationing in Mexico and could not be reached
for comment. If he listens to Smith's offer, though, he probably
can expect an offer worth $2.5 million to $3 million annually after
earning $1.7 million in base pay this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it necessarily matters, according to his Edmonton-based
agent,  &UR; Paul Kraus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people (chose not to report) as a threat, but in this
case, it isn't a threat, it's a fact,'' Kraus said. ``Look, I'm
sure (Reichel's) mind could be swayed. Everybody has a price. . . .
But he's a frugal guy, a sensible guy, and he's provided well for
his family. If he stopped playing in the NHL right now, he and his
family wouldn't be hurting at all.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Kraus, Reichel has been approached several times in
the past few years by Czech national team leader  &UR; Ivan Hlinka about
someday replacing him in Reichel's native Litvinov, the city where
the national team is based.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel has played for Hlinka on numerous occasions and was a
member of the Czech gold-medal-winning team in the 1998 Winter
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ivan wants to move on,'' Kraus said, ``and he wants Robert to
step into his shoes as the future. He's been tagged. Obviously,
(Hlinka) would want him to play for a few years before he goes off
into management and coaching, but the opportunity is there for him.
It's been there for a couple years already.'' &QL; 
Briefly &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian national team also extended an invitation to
Coyotes forward  &UR; Dallas Drake, but the veteran wing had to decline
after having a broken nose suffered in Game 7 against the St. Louis
Blues repaired last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit of a tough decision for Dallas, but it's nice
that Shane is there,'' Smith said. ``He lost an opportunity to play
in the World Junior Championships when the Winnipeg Jets did not
let him go.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Jyrki Lumme is scheduled to undergo surgery to
repair his injured left shoulder either today or Friday in
Vancouver, Smith said.

artistic product of inspired but inexplicable minds. The latest
attempt to bridge the chasm was offered last week at the Guggenheim

ALOU ADDS CLASS, CREDIBILITY TO MONEY-STARVED EXPOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sad as it is to say, the Montreal Expos may be on the
shakiest ground of any of the 30 major-league clubs.
</P>
<P>
   One season after Major League Baseball enjoyed what can arguably
be called its greatest season ever, the game remains
disproportionately unfair to clubs like the Expos, who have the
smallest payroll in the game and are forced to use ingenuity in
trying to compete with the big-money boys.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that the Expos have won just one
out of every three games they've played.
</P>
<P>
   But one area where the Expos are set beyond their means is with
Felipe Alou, who remains one of the most respected managers in the
game. Alou, who turns 64 Wednesday, is someone who has
traditionally squeezed the most out of his players.
</P>
<P>
   Simply speaking, Felipe Alou ``is'' the Montreal Expos. Within
this organization, from top to bottom, he is the one person that
gives this now 31-year-old ballclub credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Think not? Try and name three members of the Expos. It's not
easy, is it?
</P>
<P>
   Take Alou out of the Expos picture and it's a bleak-looking
portrait. But with Alou holding the reins, the Expos have a hope of
meriting their standing as a major league franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's someone I place on another pedestal,'' Diamondbacks
Manager Buck Showalter said before Monday night's game against
Montreal. ``He's on higher ground. I don't think I've ever heard
anything bad said about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely the point when it comes to Alou. He's a man
who stands above most, even though he might be managing in the
worst situation in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's hardly a secret that the Expos could very well be playing
their final season in Montreal, their home since their inception in
1969. A group of investors in the northern Virginia area are trying
to wedge themselves into position to buy and move the club to just
outside the Washington, D.C, area.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's management was so worried last fall about losing
Alou, it tore up the final season of his contract (which would have
been this season) and the following year's personal services
contract and rewarded him with a three-year, $6 million deal, tying
him with Colorado's Jim Leyland as the highest-paid manager in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The mere thought of what might arguably be the smallest of the
small-market franchises paying their manager $2 million per season
underscores his importance to the club.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Dominican native insists the almighty dollar was not the
reason he spurned Los Angeles and the opportunity to seriously
compete for a divisional title with the Dodgers, who offered Alou
their managerial post before settling on Davey Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not what makes me happy,'' Alou said. ``One has to
have principles in life. Loyalty is very important, and one must be
true to his own word. I don't think about happiness. I think I'm
happy because I've never thought about being happy. There is no
barometer in life that says if you make a certain amount of money
you will then be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou remembers being paid $22,000 a year to manage the Class A
West Palm Beach Expos for six straight years before the big-league
club called on him to take over early in the 1992 season.
</P>
<P>
   His top salary as a player was $58,000 when he was an outfielder
alongside Hank Aaron for the Atlanta Braves in the late 1960s. He
knows full well that there are more important aspects in life, like
lending himself to a greater cause.
</P>
<P>
   But Alou alone does not appear to have enough to salvage the SS
Expos from sinking in their Quebec Province.
</P>
<P>
   When it's all said and done, though, Alou will be able to look
himself in the mirror and believe he has made a difference. How
many major league managers can say the same? &QL;

MARINERS NEED GUTS TO A MAKE BOLD MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It was a beautiful day here Monday. One of the first
sunny ones we've had in awhile. One of the last, too. So say the
meteorologists, who along with the weather must be predicting the
Mariners' forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Boston, by the bottom of the first inning, Mariner
broadcaster Dave Niehaus was telling the increasingly restless
citizens of Marinerville everything we need to know about where the
1999 season was heading.
</P>
<P>
   Way back. To the wall. Over the Green Monster. Home run. For the
other guys.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before Monday's loss to the Red Sox, the M's recalled
a rookie pitcher named Brett Hinchliffe from Tacoma. And just as
one could have predicted, the kid pitched like a Rainier, loading
the bases in the first inning and then topping it with a grand slam
pitch to Red Sox clean-up hitter Nomar Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have one of those days,'' Niehaus bellowed into his
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   In Mariner-speak, ``one of those days'' means one of those days
when the Triple-A pitching staff parading as Seattle's major league
club might give up a slew of walks and longballs.
</P>
<P>
   How right was Niehaus' call. It was one of those days, all
right.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Lou Piniella mercifully lifted Hinchliffe in the
third, he had given up seven runs on three homers _ two to
Garciaparra _ and everyone back home was left to ponder the
never-ending, unanswered question:
</P>
<P>
   Where can the Mariners get some live arms to stop this exercise
in self-immolation?
</P>
<P>
   That was even before reliever Eric Weaver let Garciaparra belt
his second grand salami of the night to give the Sox a 12-4 win.
</P>
<P>
   Before we go any further, let's remember one thing: The Mariners
got rid of Randy Johnson because they could not afford to keep all
three of their marquee players in the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   So Johnson was dangled for nine torturous months while the
Mariners staked out a position _ a people-pleasing public relations
stance _ that Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez were priorities to
re-sign to long-term contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, with more than a year and half left on the deals of
both Mariner superstars, it appears a foregone conclusion that the
Mariners can't keep both Rodriguez and Griffey anyway, so it is
time to shop their shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's value holds the key to pitching health and
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Only there is one problem. The Mariners already let go of one
ace, since Johnson's $13 million a year salary was to steep for the
red-ink engulfed Mariners. So who is a legitimate front-line
starter who is not going to present the M's with a similar
financial puzzle?
</P>
<P>
   A second problem. Jose Cruz Jr.'s trade value was the key to the
Mariners' bolstering their bullpen in 1997, and look what's left of
that deal now. Nothing, which calls into question the Mariners'
ability to trade for value.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing the beloved A-Rod, the kind of deal citizens of
Marinerville are expecting would be a blockbuster. What if the
Diamondbacks offered Johnson in a trade for Rodriguez? Isn't that
the same as hoping the Braves give up John Smoltz? Rodriguez is
still a major bargain this season.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the ever-hopeful citizens of Marinerville refuse to
lose the notion that the M's are a top-tier team in baseball.
They're not.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are scaling back, not bravely building. That is why
the out-for-the-season Mark Leiter and Butch Henry were two-fifths
of the Mariners starting rotation to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us are trying to learn to lower our expectations of the
Mariners brass. Why? Because since the second half of '95, when
what the M's did started to matter, the club has done nothing but
make stop-gap deals when the pressure is on or when the trading
deadline is staring Woody Woodward in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Rodriguez right now is a different sort of animal than
anything attempted in Mariners history. Trading A-Rod is a
proposition of such proportion that it would require incredible
vision _ the kind the M's sorely lacked during the Johnson debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Rodriguez would takes guts. It would take leadership and
determination. It would take tough-minded, poker-faced negotiating
skill.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it would take just about everything the Mariners
have failed to demonstrate in four years of spiraling out of
control, out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the fiscal horizon of baseball in general is a
disaster. The Mariners have psychically handcuffed themselves
because of their tremendous debt and fear of the future, both
locally and industry-wide.
</P>
<P>
   But if Safeco Field is a new beginning for the franchise, the
M's certainly seem satisfied to move to that field of dying dreams
in neutral. They are deer frozen in the headlights because of so
many unknown costs and unsure revenues _ even as minor-leaguers
like Hinchliffe and Weaver are asked to do what clearly they're
incapable of doing at this point in time.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the conditions for this tentative franchise to
make bold, sweeping deals such as trading a Hall of Fame candidate
like Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, the Mariners are finally ready to do
something drastic, which they should. It is time to stem the swift,
rising tide of disillusionment that is eating away at the
benevolent feelings Seattle baseball fans still have for their
not-so-mightyM's, but may not have long.

AGENT: COWBOYS ASK ABOUT CORNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Could the Cowboys be contemplating life without
cornerback Deion Sanders?
</P>
<P>
   With Sanders' status for 1999 in limbo following toe surgery
last month, it seems that the Cowboys are thinking about such a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that they contacted the agent for Bengals free-agent
cornerback Ashley Ambrose last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to see where Ashley was as far as signing with
other teams,'' Kenard McGuire said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was unavailable to comment.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire said Ambrose has received three offers, but has yet to
sign. He also said his client would be very interested in the
Cowboys because he wants to be a part of a contending team.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire, however, said he didn't know how serious the Cowboys
are about his client and understands that the team has salary-cap
issues. He said the Cowboys also didn't mention whether they were
interested in his client replacing Sanders or playing alongside
him.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that the salary-cap-strapped Cowboys won't be
able to make any moves until after June 1, when they are expected
to release some players under contract. That money is expected to
give the Cowboys room to sign their rookies.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would likely need more room to sign a premier
cornerback such as Ambrose or unrestricted free-agent Ryan McNeil,
who played last season for St. Louis. Cutting Sanders, who is not
guaranteed to return this season and could be out four to six
months, might be the Cowboys' only option.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has said there is a chance Sanders might not miss any
games, has said that they would wait to see how Sanders'
rehabilitation progresses before making a decision on bringing in
another cornerback. Sanders counts $8.2 million against the salary
cap next season. If Sanders were to be released, the Cowboys would
save $6.5 million in base salary for next season and be charged
$3.4 million against the cap in 2000 for remaining two years of
bonus charges.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Cowboys could opt for their original plan and
give Sanders a contract extension to create room. However, it's
unlikely they would do that until Sanders' injury status for next
season and beyond is cleared up.

GRAND PERFORMANCE BY GARCIAPARRA 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-MARINERS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra has owned a Red Sox uniform for less time _
982 days _ than the thousand days JFK was president, playing in a
town that understands that his tales of youth and promise, hope and
glory, will shimmer long after he leaves the antiquated stage that
is Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   But for all he already has done that seems touched by myth, the
25-year-old Garciaparra did something Monday night he had never
done before.
</P>
<P>
   He surprised and delighted even himself.
</P>
<P>
   On a night that must have sent even 80-year-old Ted Williams to
dancing, his reconstructed hip be damned, Garciaparra hit three
home runs, including two grand slams, and drove in 10 runs in a
12-4 win over the pitching-deficient Seattle Mariners, equaling a
raft of records while enjoying a night he never thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of night you dream about when you're lying in
bed playing Little League,'' teammate Jim Corsi said. ``He got to
do it for real, which is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   You could see it in the glow of Garciaparra's face afterward,
his eyes reflecting a child's wonder and an artist's pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never hit three home runs in a game, not even Little
League,'' said Garciaparra, who went a month into the season (78
at-bats) before hitting his first home run of 1999. ``I'm glad I
waited until the big leagues to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're swinging well, good things happen. Today, things
felt pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra became the fourth Sox player, and first since
outfielder Fred Lynn on June 18, 1975, to have 10 RBIs in a game.
The others were first basemen Norm Zauchin (1955) and Rudy York
(1946). He is the third Sox player to hit two grand slams in a
game, joining third baseman Jim Tabor (1939) and York ('46).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know me, I don't know any stats,'' said Garciaparra, who
became the 11th major leaguer to hit two grand slams in a game, and
the second this season, joining Fernando Tatis of the Cardinals,
who hit two in one inning against the Dodgers April 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nice,'' Garciaparra said when the numbers were
recounted. ``It was a good night. I can take a good night. Like I
said, they don't come too often. You enjoy it, you're happy with
it, but I don't have a week to enjoy it. There's a game (Tuesday)
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, maybe I'll ask Skip (Jimy Williams) for a week off.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra etched his name in history on the first pitch to him
from Seattle rookie Eric Weaver with the bases loaded in the eighth
inning, driving a ball through a 14 mile-per-hour northwest wind
into the left-field screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would have swung at anything,'' he said. ``A pitch
10 feet over my head or down in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of energy going on. It was kind of neat. I
just wanted something good to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's first two home runs of the night came off another
rookie righthander, Brett Hinchliffe, who was brought up from the
minors for just this occasion but did nothing to ease the pain of a
staff that has the worst earned run average in the major leagues
(6.54).
</P>
<P>
   The Sox shortstop hit a grand slam into the visitors' bullpen in
the first inning and followed that two innings later with a two-run
home run just inside the Pesky Pole.
</P>
<P>
   The home runs gave Garciaparra five in a stretch of 21 at-bats,
and powered the Red Sox to their fifth straight win and eighth
against the Mariners in their last nine games here. Not only was it
the first three-homer game of his career, but it was the first
multihomer game by a Sox player this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shake your head and tip your cap, just one of those
things,'' said Seattle center fielder Ken Griffey, the all-world
player on the other side of the diamond who was reduced to the role
of captive audience for Garciaparra's splendid splintering.
</P>
<P>
   What amazed Griffey most about Garciaparra's performance?
</P>
<P>
   ``All those people that were on base in front of him,'' Griffey
said. ``If he hit three solo shots, you wouldn't be talking to me
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary gave the Sox another first when he followed
Garciaparra's third-inning shot with his eighth home run, which
gave the Sox an 8-2 lead and marked the first time this season
Boston has had back-to-back home runs.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Jeff Frye and John Valentin singled and
Brian Daubach was hit by a pitch before Garciaparra drove a 1-and-1
pitch into the Mariners' bullpen for his first slam.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Daubach doubled high off the left-center field
wall before Garciaparra went the opposite way again, this time
curling an 0-and-1 pitch just inside the right-field foul pole, 310
feet away.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis led off the eighth with a single, and after Frye
bounced into a force play, Valentin and Daubach walked, setting the
stage for Garciaparra's second slam, which led him to come out for
a rare curtain call.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't drive in 10 without people being on base,'' Williams
said. ``That's where it starts, with people on base, to do what he
did tonight. A special night for all of us to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox' show of power should have made it an easy night for
starter Pat Rapp, who was looking for his first win in home
polyesters. Instead, Rapp, who was knocked out of his last start
one out into the game, made another early exit, departing in the
third to the boos of a crowd of 21,660.
</P>
<P>
   Rapp gave up five hits and walked four while registering just
six outs. Rapp, whose spot in the rotation is in jeopardy after he
failed to make it through four innings for the fourth time in six
starts, was bailed out by John Wasdin, who entered with the bases
loaded in the third and the score 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin allowed a run on John Mabry's forceout but escaped
further damage when Russ Davis struck out and Scott Hatteberg cut
down Mabry stealing.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin pitched 6 1/3 strong innings before giving way to Kip
Gross for the last two outs of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin was the winning pitcher, but he knew where to send his
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already given him one hug tonight,'' Wasdin said, nodding
toward Garciaparra. ``I might just have to give him another.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the umpires interrupted the game because of a
commotion behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was when Nomar was hitting and there was a fan with
a VCR (sic) that had a light on it,'' Williams said. ``I think
somebody was just trying to capture a special night by a special
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazed by Garciaparra?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' said the irrepressible one, Pedro Martinez. ``A
great day at the office. Every day is a new adventure with Nomie.''

SOMEWHAT OF A '75 THREE-PEAT 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-WHITESIDE COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Larry Whiteside  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time, people will tell you they get tired of the
hype surrounding Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. Nobody can be
that good, they say. Sooner or later he'll become just another
ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if you still feel that way after Monday night's historic
performance at Fenway Park, then perhaps it is you who needs a
reality check. Garciaparra hit three home runs _ two of them grand
slams _ and drove in 10 runs. The last time a Boston player had a
similar night was Fred Lynn on June 18, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Days like this are for you to enjoy,'' he was saying in the
postgame press conference, which included only a few Boston media
members who were also on hand for Lynn's Night Out in Tiger
Stadium. ``I don't take them for granted. They're nice. The way
this game is, anything can happen tomorrow. So you have to enjoy
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Garciaparra's explosion, which fueled a 12-4 rout of the
Seattle Mariners, he will insist that he is not a home run hitter.
His first blast, a grand slam in the first inning, was a line drive
into the visitors' bullpen off Brett Hinchliffe. The second went to
right also, but this one, with Brian Daubach on base in the third
inning, snaked around the Pesky Pole. All Garciaparra was trying to
do was advance the runner.
</P>
<P>
   The last one was the stuff of legends. Few of the 21,660 people
who were in Fenway Park will recall the name of Eric Weaver, the
Seattle reliever who gave up the second grand slam, in the eighth
inning. But it is worth noting that the homer came on the first
pitch to Garciaparra after a long chat by Seattle pitching coach
Stan Williams with his young pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like it,'' said Williams, who just happened to be the
Red Sox pitching coach in 1975 and thus an eyewitness to Lynn's
heroics. ``It's the second time in my career that I saw 10 RBIs in
a game, in 46 years. This year, I've already seen a guy (Pudge
Rodriguez of Texas) get nine against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't forgotten the Lynn night. He hit three home runs to
right and then he drove one to left that could have been a fourth
home run. The last time at bat he had an infield single. It was
quite a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra sent people scurrying to the record books. He is the
second player this season to hit two grand slams in a game _
Fernando Tatis of St. Louis hit them in the same inning April 23 _
and the first Red Sox player to do it since Rudy York on July 27,
1946. He is the fourth Red Sox player to drive in 10 runs in a
game, joining York, Lynn, and Norm Zauchin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' said Garciaparra. ``I never in my life had
hit three home runs in a game, let alone two grand slams. As I
crossed home plate, I looked at all the guys and I was speechless.
I didn't know what to say. All I could do was put a little smile on
my face. The crowd, the curtain call, all the emotion, all the
adrenaline flowing . . . it was really nice. The fans were great. I
love playing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rice, Boston's hitting coach, was another who was there in
1975, as a teammate of Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't try to explain the differences between Freddie and
Nomar,'' said Rice. ``Ten RBIs are 10 RBIs. As long as you win,
that's a good day. In fact, for some people it's a good week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also hit three home runs for your team and lose a
game. I know a guy who did that. I hit three home runs against
Oakland once. Mitchell Page hit two home runs and we lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar earned his home runs. He hit the ball hard. If you do
that, you've got a chance. He didn't get cheated on any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Jimy Williams was as impressed as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen three home runs before but not 10 RBIs,'' said
Williams. ``How about the guys who got on before him? That's
special, too. It means a lot when other guys are on base.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a night Garciaparra will never forget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day turned out to be pretty special,'' he said. ``I wasn't
looking for anything that last time. I just swung. Maybe it went
out just because of the adrenaline. Just try to make contact and
maybe some good thing will happen. This time, it did.''

   As for this 1999 Rockets team, particularly in the case of the
guy who blew into town from Chicago and likes to blow off a little
steam when things don't go right, it can learn from those bygone
glory days.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it's easy to gleefully point to the Rockets' 1994 and
1995 NBA championships and remember only the fairy-tale endings.
It's easy to be blinded by the glitter of the title rings, to think
those teams bounced into the sunset hand-in-hand, humming
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah and skipping through a field of flowers in full
bloom.
</P>
<P>
   But memories can be tinted in sweet shades of color, like pages
out of a children's book, when everything works out and everyone
lives happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   You think Scottie Pippen's very public and very ill-timed
finger-pointing escapade after Sunday's 101-100 Game 1 playoff loss
to the Lakers was the first time dissension sneaked into the
Rockets' locker room?
</P>
<P>
   Two words: Vernon Maxwell. Two more: Clyde Drexler. Two more:
Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   We can go on. But suffice it to say that once upon a time, there
were several occasions during the glory years when coach Rudy
Tomjanovich walked into the locker room only to find the fairy tale
unraveling before his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There was Maxwell, griping about something or other or
challenging a teammate to a fight. There was Horry, being flaky.
There was Kenny Smith, telling people how his 1-for-13 night was
not as bad as it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   There was Otis Thorpe, questioning anything worth questioning.
There was Drexler, perusing a statistics sheet to check his minutes
and points.
</P>
<P>
   All those moments now seem inconsequential, because now they
are. Those teams won. They knew when, where and how to lodge
complaints, lobby for minutes, soothe bad feelings and find a way
to make it all better.
</P>
<P>
   This one needs to learn what those teams knew, as brittle as
they sometimes seemed: Shut up and play.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen indeed pointed fingers after Game 1, although he said
Monday, ``I wasn't pointing at one or two guys. I just didn't think
we were doing the smart thing at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pippen indeed dropped the ball in more ways than one in the
critical moments of the loss. He indeed stuck a wedge further into
the fragile chemistry of a team that has had trouble finding its
way all year.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich didn't want to talk about Pippen's finger-pointing
Monday, because Rudy T knows it's not something you do publicly
when you're in the playoffs and two losses away from the season
evaporating.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, Tomjanovich was miffed at Pippen for dumping the
blame on teammates when it was Pippen who committed the critical
late turnover. And it was Pippen who got smoked by the Lakers' Glen
Rice to the tune of 29 points on 12-of-17 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hakeem Olajuwon of Pippen's outburst against his teammates:
``You don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon knows how a championship team overcomes problems.
Tomjanovich knows. Pippen should have known.
</P>
<P>
   You deal with problems and rifts in team meetings, which the
Rockets had before Monday's practice, and within the walls of the
locker room. Then you just play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pippen again questioned the makeup of this Rockets team
Monday, saying, ``It's still a challenge for us right now. There
are a lot of things you can point your finger at. We're still not
there yet. We're still not jelling.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just one loss. There remain several opportunities and
several ways the Rockets can make it all better and still make a
run for the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen can play better defense against Rice. The rookies,
Michael Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley, should find a way to stay out
of foul trouble and create more on the fast break. Silly turnovers
should be eliminated. The defense should find a way to correct its
season-long problem of not rotating to the open man on the
perimeter _ Sunday's 37-point second quarter by the Lakers was
inexcusable.
</P>
<P>
   You think the Rockets never have had to overcome so much in the
midst of the playoffs? Of course they have.
</P>
<P>
   But those were fairy-tale seasons. This one has been a nightmare
considering the great deeds it promised when Pippen arrived from
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   If ultimately it doesn't all work out and the season indeed
crumbles away, there will be no storybook tale this time. There
will be only more finger-pointing. And maybe the first person we
all should point at is Pippen.

VAN GOGH TO DRAW MIDNIGHT CROWDS IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vincent's paintings are Goghing, Goghing but not
gone until midnight Sunday, and people desperate to see the
exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art still can get
tickets _ in the wee small hours of the morning.
</P>
<P>
   With the museum staying open overnight during the weekend for
the climax of the Van Gogh exhibition, tickets remain available
Saturday between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. and Sunday from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m.
and from 10 p.m. to 11 p.m. Tickets are available through
Ticketmaster and at the museum for $20 from 9 a.m. to midnight, $10
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism of the crammed exhibit space at the former May
Co. store, the exhibition was LACMA's biggest hit since the
``Treasures of Tutankhamen'' exhibit in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided I really didn't want to miss it,'' said Amy
Howard of Woodland Hills, who viewed the French impressionist's
works Monday on her first visit to LACMA since Tutankhamen.
</P>
<P>
   With about 750,000 tickets sold and the show in its final week,
LACMA's ``Van Gogh's Van Goghs'' exhibition is among the most
heavily attended in the United States in the past 20 years, said
spokesman Adam Coyne.
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2million people thronged to ``Treasures of
Tutankhamen,'' LACMA's biggest show ever, but only 240,000 saw its
recent Picasso show.
</P>
<P>
   Since its Jan. 17 opening, the exhibition has been drawing
crowds to LACMA West on Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue.
Also, the closing was extended, from the original date of April 4
to Sunday and will be open 9 a.m. Friday to midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The final weekend's around-the-clock schedule is a first for an
American museum, although London's Royal Academy did it recently
for a Claude Monet exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really was just a lot of demand for this show,'' Coyne
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since last July, membership has more than doubled from 64,000 to
more than 130,000, Coyne said. Membership begins at $65 a year for
two adults and their children under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoying ``A Pair of Shoes'' and other works Monday was Gunnar
Anderson of Santa Ana who had seen the paintings once before in
Amsterdam. A Southern California resident for three years, he was
making his first visit to LACMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because this stuff is never going to leave Holland
again,'' he said, citing what he understood to be the high cost of
insuring the works.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, said Coyne, the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam _ which
during renovations sent the paintings to the National Gallery in
Washington, D.C., and to LACMA _ is unlikely to release them again
as a group for many, many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime exhibition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coyne said there were few scalping problems.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the main lesson learned from the large response was
to ``overprepare,'' which he said they did. The museum opened LACMA
West in October to make sure the building was ready for the
exhibit, conducted staff rehearsals and installed a special queuing
tent and a food tent just for the Van Gogh crowd.

 ALBANIAN CLANS TRYING TO TAKE OVER KOSOVAR CRIME NETWORK  &HT;     By FRANK VIVIANO 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In the shadows of the war in Kosovo, a ferocious
upheaval is reshaping the criminal landscape of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO bombs and Serbian troops disrupt a Kosovar crime network
that has dominated the narcotics trade across the continent,
underworld clans from neighboring Albania are making a powerful bid
to take over.
</P>
<P>
   They are the real government of Europe's poorest _ and most
lawless _ nation, and by some estimates even more dangerous to the
Allied campaign than the tanks and anti-aircraft systems of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albania has become the leading country in a wide variety of
trafficking, in clandestine immigration, in prostitution. It ranks
as a top exporter of narcotics,'' the nation's own former
president, Sali Berisha, charged in a January speech accusing his
successors of corruption and links to criminal syndicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently, our heroin abusers got their supplies from
Kosovars based in Zurich,'' Chief Jean-Bernard Lagger of the Geneva
police brigade told investigators from Geopolitical Drug Watch
(OGD), Europe's most respected narcotics surveillance organization.
``But now, Albanian traffickers have moved into Geneva to deliver
drugs to their doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials say that the clans, known as ``fares'' in
Albanian, have even begun contesting turf with South American
cartels in the European cocaine market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The criminal mentality in certain fares existed before the
war, but it was relatively small-time,'' says Michel Koutouzis,
senior researcher at OGD and Europe's leading expert on organized
crime in the Balkans. ``What the Kosovo crisis and the war have
done is to elevate that mentality enormously, to push it to a much
higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   The clans have embraced what police officials call the
``Sicilian model'' of criminal organization. Put simply, this model
works on the consolidation of a firm power base at home, with
deadly influence on the political structure, from which domestic
crime syndicates gradually build international operations.
</P>
<P>
   By the time NATO and hundreds of thousands of Kosovar refugees
arrived in Albania two months ago, the consolidation was well under
way. ``Whole districts and towns are actually under the utter
control of the gangs,'' former president Berisha says.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside surrounding the cities of Vlore and Durres,
according to the French weekly Le Nouvel Observateur and other
European periodicals, refugee convoys from the war zone have been
held up by armed bands in the past two weeks, with young Kosovar
women singled out and abducted.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the country, humanitarian workers and journalists
from many Western news services report highly organized war
profiteering _ including the diversion of aid shipments into the
black market, bribery demands by customs agents processing the
shipments in Albanian ports, and gang-run ``taxi firms'' charging
as much as $120 to transport exhausted refugee families less than
eight miles from the Kosovo border to the Albanian town of Kukes.
The normal fee is $4.
</P>
<P>
   An unheated room for aid workers in Kukes today rents for $300
per night, in ramshackle houses that sold outright for less than
$1,000 before the NATO bombings began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the Klondike during the Gold Rush,'' Albanian
journalist Frrok(CQ) Cupi told the Swiss weekly Die Weltwoche,
describing the profits being reaped from foreign military and
humanitarian operations.
</P>
<P>
   Men claiming to be sales agents for the national
telecommunications company have asked as much as $3,000 for the
computer card necessary to connect a cellular phone with the
satellite network.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should know from experience _ from places like Rwanda and
Somalia and Bosnia _ that humanitarian agencies must deal with the
local mafias in a war zone,'' says Koutouzis. ``There is no other
way to get to the victims.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who try to sidestep the clan syndicates do so at their own
peril, in a land where the number of illegally owned Kalashnikov
automatic assault weapons in some cities is greater than the number
of residents.
</P>
<P>
   On April 30, the Associated Press reported that ``almost every
journalist'' who has gone to the refugee camp at Bajram Curri in
northern Albania has been robbed, including a team from the
Associated Press. The Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which oversees the camp, has had two of its official
vehicles hijacked by armed men.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army's Task Force Hawk installation at the Tirana
airport, outside the Albanian capital, ranks ``crime'' ahead of
``Yugoslav forces'' among the main threats to American troops in
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Locked inside a hermit country for half a century while the
eccentric pseudo-Marxist regime of the late Enver Hoxha prevailed,
the Albanian clans did not arrive on the European organized crime
scene until the early 1990s, more than a decade after Kosovar drug
lords mounted their own successful takeover of the heroin trade.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian crime bosses have made up for their late start with
extraordinary aggressiveness and risk-taking, say European law
enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany alone, more than 800 Albanian nationals are currently
serving prison sentences for heroin trafficking, a phenomenal
number from a country with scarcely 3 million people. The only
larger foreign group in German prisons is from Turkey, which has 20
times the population of Albania and millions of its citizens
resident in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Unhampered by the political struggle that led Kosovar drug
bosses to put their empires at risk in a war with Belgrade,
Albanian clans have also extended their reach far beyond the drug
trade. As their local power base has solidified, they have rapidly
become major players in a dizzying array of criminal enterprises
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Regional clans from southern Albania are believed to have formed
an active partnership with the Sicilian Cosa Nostra and its
branches in mainland Italy, and emerged as the principal agents and
enforcers in sex rings fed by Albanian speedboat fleets that ferry
undocumented immigrants across the Adriatic Sea.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a Chronicle reporter found dozens of automobiles
with Palermo license plates parked under heavy guard in the
gang-infested southern port of Vlore, near waterfront cafes where
much of the conversation was in Sicilian dialect. The police chief
of Vlore, Colonel Sokol Kociu, contends that a special high-speed
ferry service has even been established to serve Cosa Nostra
emissaries traveling back and forth between Sicily and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials in Italy say the Cosa Nostra is moving
steadily into finance and money-laundering, while the dirty work of
international organized crime is subcontracted to others.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking the substantial Albanian presence in this
arena.
</P>
<P>
   Of 447 men and women arrested in Italy in 1997 for
``exploitation of prostitutes,'' according to that country's
Ministry of the Interior, 204 were Albanian nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, a Milan court indicted 20 Albanian men who
were allegedly part of a syndicate that transported 800
unaccompanied Albanian children under age 16 to Italy, where many
were forced to beg in the streets under threat of torture.
</P>
<P>
   The speedboats that carried these children west have not been
deterred by dozens of Allied warships in the Adriatic. On a single
night during the NATO bombardments of Kosovo and Serbia, April 26,
the contraband fleet dumped 1,200 clandestine emigrants on the
beaches of southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The violence of the Albanian crime clans has soared
exponentially since 1997, when Albania's entire financial structure
collapsed, throwing the country into chaos. Riots erupted across
the nation. Army units and meagerly paid police, who earn under
$100 per month, abandoned their bases and armories.
</P>
<P>
   In the free-for-all that ensued, looters carried off an
estimated 2 million pounds of explosives and 750,000 to 1,000,000
Kalashnikov rifles. The Albanian government says that fewer than 10
percent of the looted weapons have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, as long as the arms stores circulating in Albania
aren't recovered, a real crackdown on crime there will not be
feasible,'' says Italian Interior Minister Rosa Jervolino, who
leads Rome's effort to coordinate law enforcement activities
against Albanian-based underworld organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian legislature, known locally as ``the Kalashnikov
Parliament'' because of its members' ties to weapons dealers, shows
little interest in the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The arms windfall provided an important boost to the the KLA in
Kosovo, but an even larger one to the narcotics bosses and
smugglers of Albania. ``The same crime groups that traffic in human
beings also traffic in drugs and in weapons,'' says Jervolino.
</P>
<P>
   The economic and social effects of their activity _ and the
intimidation that often accompanies it _ have been devastating.
``The number of the Italian investors in Albania is 10 times less
than it was in 1996,'' notes former president Berisha. ``Thousands
and thousands of intellectuals are fleeing Albania only because
they feel insecure for their lives and for the lives of their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, one-fifth of the country's entire population has
abandoned Albania, usually for the grim life of an undocumented
alien in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Vlore and its rival northern counterpart, Durres, are also
primary stations on Europe's most extensive stolen car circuit,
which doubles as a transport system for narcotics. Hundreds of
late-model luxury cars are parked on the streets. The cars have
usually completed a circuitous journey, with both drivers and
vehicles carrying faked papers, crossing through several Western
European nations before they enter Albania from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At each stage of the journey, the cars deliver drugs and stock
up on televisions, video equipment and other household goods,'' the
OGD reports. ``A `transporter car' will make only one or two
international trips, to avoid identification. The car is given as a
bonus to the courier, who can have its registration changed by
making a simple declaration to an Albanian official.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chronicle interviews three months ago, clan leaders in Vlore
openly boasted that two-thirds of all automobiles in the country
are stolen. ``We regard that figure as entirely credible,'' said
Lieutenant Domenico DiGianturco of the Guardia di Finanza, Italy's
customs police.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the central bank of Albania made the mistake of
taking one of the vehicles on a vacation to Italy in 1996 _ where
he was promptly arrested by the Guardia di Finanza and charged with
car theft.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery demands by Albania's own customs officers, a thriving
business in ``normal'' times, has boomed with the avalanche of
humanitarian aid and military supplies. The number of trucks
disembarking at the port of Durres from Italian ferries has risen
by nearly 700 percent in two months, from an average of fewer than
30 per day to more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to prevent massive theft, insists Colonel Kociu,
Vlore's beleaguered police commander, is to put the trucks
immediately under the protection of a special armed military force
as soon the convoys arrive. Otherwise, he says, ``the aid meant for
refugee camps will be diverted onto the black market.''
</P>
<P>
   Kociu echoes Berisha's charge that the crime clans are directly
linked to political parties in Tirana, and through them wield
control over the nation's ragged customs service. Although current
President Rexhep Mejdani, a former physics professor, is personally
regarded as honest, even he concedes that graft and racketeering in
his own bureaucracy are out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable sources told The Chronicle that a European Union
investigative unit assembled 70 files on customs corruption and
turned them over to the Albanian finance ministry in January. The
findings have not yet been made public.
</P>
<P>
   But evidence of the corruption's scale can be gleaned from a
mammoth disparity between declared tax and customs receipts and the
consumption of certain import goods in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, reports Tirana journalist Sami Neza, Albanians smoked
an estimated 8,000 tons of U.S. and Western European cigarettes.
The total amount officially checked through Albanian customs was 11
tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a virus that stands in the way of being honest in
Albania: the virus of illegality,'' Colonel Kociu says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This virus lives and exists for the wretched interests of
politicians. It is cultivated in the nerve centers of the state, in
the customs service, in law enforcement, in the courts. It's an
epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, a four-man official delegation from the Albanian
government was prevented by Italian police from boarding a flight
to France while the plane was in transit at Milan's Malpensa
airport. The police were put on guard by discrepancies in one of
the men's diplomatic passports. The suspicious ``diplomat'' turned
out to be Gazmend Mahmutaj _ wanted for murder, and thought by
European police to be the Albanian mafia's ``boss of bosses'' _
traveling under an alias.
</P>
<P>
   His destination was the headquarters of the European Parliament
in Strasbourg, where the group was scheduled to participate in the
ratification of an International Crime Tribunal treaty.

MONDESI LIFTS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 WRITETHROUGH (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Raul Mondesi has heard it time and again. From his
teammates, others in baseball and just about anyone who knows he
and Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa are both from the Dominican
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   However, after Mondesi hit a pair of two-run homers to lift the
Los Angeles Dodgers to a 4-3 win against the Cubs at Dodger Stadium
on Monday, he did all he could to squash the nonsensical Sosa
comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   For clarification, Mondesi wasn't inspired that Sosa was in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't show up opening day and I hit two,'' Mondesi said.
``If he was here, it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Also unimportant to Mondesi was the fact that Steve Trachsel
(1-4) was the Cubs pitcher, despite the fact that Mondesi has owned
the right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi had no idea he's 12 of 34 (.353) against Trachsel. Nor
did he know he has seven homers and 13 RBI against Trachsel.
</P>
<P>
   What was paramount was Mondesi's ability to deliver in the
clutch again. Eight of his 11 homers have either tied games or put
the Dodgers ahead. The latest two home runs also came after the
Dodgers held a players-only meeting to discuss the direction of the
team _ suddenly a big concern after losing two of three games to
the lowly Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mondesi's) more patient at the plate this year,'' said
Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield, pointing to Mondesi's
team-high 21 walks. ``That's all it takes . . . when you're as
deadly as he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's first homer gave the Dodgers a 2-1 lead in the fourth
when he hit a fastball to right-center. Sosa barely moved when the
ball was hit.
</P>
<P>
   He put the Dodgers ahead 4-1 in the sixth when he smashed a
Trachsel fastball over the left-field fence. Ahead in the count
1-2, Trachsel tried to throw a fastball low and away. Instead, he
threw one belt-high and inside, and Mondesi hit his second homer,
the 10th time in his career and first time since opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That second one wasn't a strike, but he's got enough strength
to hit that kind of pitch out of the park,'' said Trachsel, who
allowed two homers in his previous 43 innings. ``You could throw
him a knee-high strike and split the plate and he'll miss it. Next
time you could throw a pitch over his head and he'll hit it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's 10th and 11th homers of the season were enough to give
right-hander Ismael Valdes (4-1) the win. He labored through six
innings, throwing 121 pitches but allowing only one run. Valdes
allowed nine hits and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had a pair of base runners in four of Valdes' six
innings and even had three hits in the fourth inning but could not
score. The only run the Cubs scored off Valdes came via Tyler
Houston's leadoff home run in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of batting, from the first pitch to the last
out,'' Valdes said. ``It's easy to pitch a ball game when you have
your best stuff. When you don't have your good stuff, you have to
figure out how to get batters out. You have to fight all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' ninth win in their last 13 games wasn't without
excitement, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs chipped away for a run in the seventh off reliever Alan
Mills and pulled within 4-3 when Henry Rodriguez's two-out single
off closer Jeff Shaw scored Mark Grace.
</P>
<P>
   But Shaw, in his first save opportunity since April 30, struck
out Benito Santiago for his eighth save. Shaw has converted 18
straight save opportunities dating back to last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're trying to build some momentum,'' Dodgers
manager Davey Johnson said, ``but we haven't been able to get over
the hump.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS _ The question was serious, but the answer came back
with a full, shoulder-heaving laugh.
</P>
<P>
   No, replied the senior NATO diplomat, the alliance had not made
contact with dissident elements in Belgrade: ``Quite frankly,'' he
said, ``we are not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost seven weeks into the bombing campaign a sudden outburst
of frankness has struck NATO's headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to avoid the self-criticism last week when the
organization's most senior military official, General Klaus
Naumann, sparked a debate about its frailties in an unusually blunt
farewell press conference.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, he said, had failed in its initial conflict aims,
squandered its chances of surprising the Yugoslav army and needed
``to find a way to reconcile the conditions of a coalition war with
the principles of military operations.''
</P>
<P>
   This profound soul-searching is, however, only half the picture.
NATO's top brass have not just admitted their weaknesses, but have
begun to address them.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in an unexpectedly protracted air campaign, the
alliance's lethargic military bureaucracy has had to adapt to
survive. And NATO has done so by expanding its responsibilities,
beefing up its diplomacy and aiming to forge a new, transnational
political entity.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, in the aftermath of the Cold War, the
alliance had been searching for a role and, ahead of last month's
Washington summit, the organization was busy debating its mission
statement, or ``strategic concept.''
</P>
<P>
   As one NATO diplomat put it: ``Suddenly Kosovo appears and
presents NATO with a hothouse flower. Theories had been going
around about what will be required in the Europe in the coming
century _ and then it presents itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvisation has proved more successful than theory. NATO's
immediate decision to assume humanitarian work was, in the words of
one senior diplomat, ``extraordinarily successful in responding
quickly to a situation which was overwhelming the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees and the other agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the public gaze, NATO embarked on an escalation of
diplomacy and a politicization which had not been foreseen before
the Kosovo campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   The central task was to keep the alliance together. Through
astute stewardship and skillful avoidance of the most divisive
issues, the 19 member states have stayed reasonably united _
despite the fact that in one of their number _ Greece _ 96 percent
of the population oppose the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If diplomacy has been active within the alliance, it has
extended well beyond it too. Javier Solana, NATO's secretary
general, was the first to hold high-profile meetings with
politicians from countries neighboring Yugoslavia, cajoling
Albania, Bulgaria and Romania into handing over their airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there have been visits to the region from British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
U.S. General Wesley Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are even some worries that Yugoslavia's neighbors
are experiencing ``VIP fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has NATO been afraid to improvise on the diplomatic side,
particularly in the case of Macedonia. As one senior diplomat put
it: ``The Macedonian government has been very uncomfortable about
the volume of refugees it was receiving and worried about the
ethnic balance in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some worry about the presence of NATO troops in
Macedonia, but also a feeling that the country was not getting its
payoff in terms of cash, security guarantees and pledges on NATO
and EU membership.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the solution NATO installed its own representative in
Skopje, Hans Eiff, Bonn's former ambassador to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   On the global stage NATO has acted as a clearinghouse for
international efforts. Again the process has been pragmatic, with
the alliance's key member states applying pressure through the
different bodies to which they are affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   The oil embargo against Yugoslavia, for example, was initiated
by the European Union, thanks to British, French and Dutch
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to bind the Russians and the United Nations to a peace
proposal compatible with NATO's five conditions was brokered with
German help through the Group of Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders are pursuing these plans through a variety of
forums,'' said one official, ``but the ideas are coming out of
NATO.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 725. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   All of this is part of a wider awakening. NATO was always a
marriage of military and political structures, but the civilian
side was muted during the Cold War because the objectives were
consensual ones. The case for the air bombardment has taken much
more selling.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently the media war has been given a new priority,
boosted by the influx of a new unit, equipping the alliance with
all the expertise now available to modern political parties when
they fight elections.
</P>
<P>
   A team of around seven full-time press officers and 23
back-office and technical staff has been augmented by another 30
personnel, linking the civilian and military machines and
coordinating with the important NATO capitals.
</P>
<P>
   And the pursuit of NATO's ``message'' has been taken to new
rhetorical heights. In the process the familiar separation in which
the military handle the weaponry and the politicians, who deploy
the rhetoric, has all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, this recent condemnation of Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic: ``Those of us who have grown up in liberal
democracies have had a hard time truly appreciating what is
happening right now in Kosovo.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS _ The question was serious, but the answer came back
with a full, shoulder-heaving laugh.
</P>
<P>
   No, replied the senior NATO diplomat, the alliance had not made
contact with dissident elements in Belgrade: ``Quite frankly,'' he
said, ``we are not that good.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost seven weeks into the bombing campaign a sudden outburst
of frankness has struck NATO's headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to avoid the self-criticism last week when the
organization's most senior military official, General Klaus
Naumann, sparked a debate about its frailties in an unusually blunt
farewell press conference.
</P>
<P>
   NATO, he said, had failed in its initial conflict aims,
squandered its chances of surprising the Yugoslav army and needed
``to find a way to reconcile the conditions of a coalition war with
the principles of military operations.''
</P>
<P>
   This profound soul-searching is, however, only half the picture.
NATO's top brass have not just admitted their weaknesses, but have
begun to address them.
</P>
<P>
   Caught up in an unexpectedly protracted air campaign, the
alliance's lethargic military bureaucracy has had to adapt to
survive. And NATO has done so by expanding its responsibilities,
beefing up its diplomacy and aiming to forge a new, transnational
political entity.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, in the aftermath of the Cold War, the
alliance had been searching for a role and, ahead of last month's
Washington summit, the organization was busy debating its mission
statement, or ``strategic concept.''
</P>
<P>
   As one NATO diplomat put it: ``Suddenly Kosovo appears and
presents NATO with a hothouse flower. Theories had been going
around about what will be required in the Europe in the coming
century _ and then it presents itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Improvisation has proved more successful than theory. NATO's
immediate decision to assume humanitarian work was, in the words of
one senior diplomat, ``extraordinarily successful in responding
quickly to a situation which was overwhelming the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees and the other agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   But outside the public gaze, NATO embarked on an escalation of
diplomacy and a politicization which had not been foreseen before
the Kosovo campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   The central task was to keep the alliance together. Through
astute stewardship and skillful avoidance of the most divisive
issues, the 19 member states have stayed reasonably united _
despite the fact that in one of their number _ Greece _ 96 percent
of the population oppose the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If diplomacy has been active within the alliance, it has
extended well beyond it too. Javier Solana, NATO's secretary
general, was the first to hold high-profile meetings with
politicians from countries neighboring Yugoslavia, cajoling
Albania, Bulgaria and Romania into handing over their airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Since then there have been visits to the region from British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and
U.S. General Wesley Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are even some worries that Yugoslavia's neighbors
are experiencing ``VIP fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has NATO been afraid to improvise on the diplomatic side,
particularly in the case of Macedonia. As one senior diplomat put
it: ``The Macedonian government has been very uncomfortable about
the volume of refugees it was receiving and worried about the
ethnic balance in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some worry about the presence of NATO troops in
Macedonia, but also a feeling that the country was not getting its
payoff in terms of cash, security guarantees and pledges on NATO
and EU membership.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the solution NATO installed its own representative in
Skopje, Hans Eiff, Bonn's former ambassador to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   On the global stage NATO has acted as a clearinghouse for
international efforts. Again the process has been pragmatic, with
the alliance's key member states applying pressure through the
different bodies to which they are affiliated.
</P>
<P>
   The oil embargo against Yugoslavia, for example, was initiated
by the European Union, thanks to British, French and Dutch
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The plan to bind the Russians and the United Nations to a peace
proposal compatible with NATO's five conditions was brokered with
German help through the Group of Eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leaders are pursuing these plans through a variety of
forums,'' said one official, ``but the ideas are coming out of
NATO.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 725. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   All of this is part of a wider awakening. NATO was always a
marriage of military and political structures, but the civilian
side was muted during the Cold War because the objectives were
consensual ones. The case for the air bombardment has taken much
more selling.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently the media war has been given a new priority,
boosted by the influx of a new unit, equipping the alliance with
all the expertise now available to modern political parties when
they fight elections.
</P>
<P>
   A team of around seven full-time press officers and 23
back-office and technical staff has been augmented by another 30
personnel, linking the civilian and military machines and
coordinating with the important NATO capitals.
</P>
<P>
   And the pursuit of NATO's ``message'' has been taken to new
rhetorical heights. In the process the familiar separation in which
the military handle the weaponry and the politicians, who deploy
the rhetoric, has all but disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, this recent condemnation of Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic: ``Those of us who have grown up in liberal
democracies have had a hard time truly appreciating what is
happening right now in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a grand combination of terror and ethnic cleansing on a
vast scale, it's being perpetrated largely against defenseless
civilians by the last vestige of a Communist dictatorship in
Europe. Man does not do this to his fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement was delivered not by a political leader but by
General Clark.
</P>
<P>
   While the military results in Kosovo may have been
disappointing, NATO as an organization has undoubtedly been
energized. The downside to this expanded new role is that the
stakes have been raised.
</P>
<P>

   LONDON _ One unremarkable rectangular building of the type to be
found in any modern city, with windows of blue mirrored glass, and
a red flag with five golden stars flying from its roof.
</P>
<P>
   Three bombs dropped by a single aircraft, possibly an American
B-2 ``Stealth'' bomber, the most expensive aircraft mankind has
ever built, costing $2 billion a copy.
</P>
<P>
   The result: just possibly the beginning of the end of NATO's
attempt to impose its will over Kosovo by force.
</P>
<P>
   For the Atlantic alliance, Monday was the most ominous day yet
in the campaign it launched seven weeks ago with the noblest of
motives, to put an end to the monstrous repression of the Kosovo
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   An American president vacillates. Britain's government faces its
strongest domestic criticism yet. The German government trembles,
its ruling coalition strained close to breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing his opponents' vulnerability, Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic opens the bidding for a negotiated end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   And NATO's attempts to steer a settlement onto the safer ground
of the United Nations now risk being held hostage by Russia and
China, two great powers that have occasionally been its friends,
but by history and world outlook, are instinctively its
adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   The air strike against the Chinese embassy in Belgrade confirms
the first law of those who adhere to the screw-up theory in life:
the more sophisticated the means at hand (in this case the
intelligence-gathering capability of the CIA), the more elementary
is likely to be the inevitable mistake (in this case, it would
appear, relying on an out-of-date map. Alas, if only someone had
slipped out to buy a ``Fodor's Yugoslavia 1999'' guide).
</P>
<P>
   It also constitutes an astonishing turning point in a war that
has already seen several of them.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign that NATO misguidedly thought would wrap up
matters in a few days has succeeded in transforming a dirty little
conflict in a benighted southeastern corner of Europe into a world
war.
</P>
<P>
   Not of course a world war in the sense of the one ignited by
other Balkan goings-on 85 years ago _ but in the geographic sense
of a European war whose successful prosecution may now depend upon
decisions taken 6,000 miles away in the Far East, by a country that
until Friday night had only the most academic of interest of what
was happening in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   At first, as rioting swept the streets around the American,
British and other NATO-country missions in Beijing, the Chinese
seemed to be walking a deliberate tightrope.
</P>
<P>
   China sanctioned the protests, even breaking off trade and
security talks with the U.S., but stopped short of threatening to
interfere in the crucial work at the U.N., where of course they
have the right of veto.
</P>
<P>
   That fond hope vanished Monday as Jiang Zemin, the Chinese
president, declared that unless the alliance first stopped the
bombing, Beijing would prevent the U.N. Security Council from even
discussing a plan to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   Defiantly, NATO sticks to its mantra: the air strikes go on
until Milosevic ``demonstrably'' starts to withdraw all his troops
from the province.
</P>
<P>
   At which point, with malign and practiced timing, the Yugoslav
president delivers a new gambit _ announcing a partial troop
withdrawal, as of Sunday evening, that apparently would reduce
their number to that of the eve of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Britain, the U.S. and Germany instantly rejected the concession
as too little, insisting the strikes would continue until NATO's
five conditions were met. But doubts may have been sown, widening
the cracks on NATO's home front. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 300 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in the Commons since the war began,
bipartisanship splintered Monday as the Conservative Shadow Foreign
Secretary Michael Howard called the embassy bombing as an act of
``gross incompetence'' and suggesting that ``the action is being
made up as we go along and has not been properly thought through.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream Labour's indignation was predictable. Even so, in the
country which has consistently been most hawkish on Kosovo, the
exchange was noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, by contrast, the cracks are visible and gaping. A
malicious fate has decreed that the first NATO leader in Beijing
since the fiasco will be Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, fighting to
keep an ever more rebellious Green party within his government.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, who has been peremptorily told to leave behind the
imposing delegation of businessmen that was to accompany him, and
to come for just one day instead of five, will undoubtedly be sent
home with an unnerving scolding.
</P>
<P>
   All this too, on the eve of a special Green party conference
that at the very least will vent fierce misgivings at the war _
misgivings now shared by a section of the Chancellor's own Social
Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
   If public skepticism in Britain is starting to grow, in Germany
it is becoming deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ground war which offers the best guarantee of NATO
securing its five points, looks less likely than ever. If the
Kosovo refugees are to start going home before the winter, a land
operation must start by the end of July at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, despite an extra 1,000 troops here, an extra 2000
there, no coherent buildup appears to have even begun. Given the
required lead time of at least two months, May 31 constitutes a
kind of deadline. Almost certainly, it will not be met. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A kind of Catch-22 prevails,'' notes Anatole Lieven of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ``The air
war is becoming increasingly unpopular, but _ with the possible
exception of Britain _ no one is getting more enthusiastic about a
ground war.''
</P>
<P>
   That bleak analysis applies above all to the U.S., without whose
participation a ground war is inconceivable. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alas, malicious fate has also decreed that America's leader
should be a man disqualified by his own record from leading the
country into a conflict where lives will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   So the chimera will be pursued, of a war which must be won
comprehensively, but without Western casualties. Ineluctably, the
trail is leading to the U.N., whose cover even NATO countries
accept is essential for the diplomatic endgame to be played out.
</P>
<P>
   Short of popular uprising in Belgrade, or a bomb on Milosevic as
lucky as the one on the Chinese embassy was unlucky, it is far
harder to construct a scenario for NATO securing the terms it is
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Almost impudently, Slobodan Milosevic, responsible for savagery
unknown in Europe for 50 years, ignores the West's demands for a
strongly armed, NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   His latest offer, relayed via Yasushi Akashi, the former U.N.
envoy to Yugoslavia, apparently is acceptance of a U.N.-led force,
lightly armed, and containing no soldiers from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   The allies doggedly insist that American, British and French
forces will be at its core, but even with an ambiguous U.N.
resolution, the chances of their having their way have surely been
diminished by the events of the last 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, has
acquired fresh weight. Subtly, he has been transformed from NATO's
mailman to Milosevic, into a potential independent peacemaker, with
new room to navigate between the two sides _ his own calls for an
end to the bombing now reinforced by the president of distant
China. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC;

   NATO may yet prevail. But a trio of bombs on a building in

<P>
   Mainstream Labour's indignation was predictable. Even so, in the
country which has consistently been most hawkish on Kosovo, the
exchange was noteworthy.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, by contrast, the cracks are visible and gaping. A
malicious fate has decreed that the first NATO leader in Beijing
since the fiasco will be Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, fighting to
keep an ever more rebellious Green party within his government.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, who has been peremptorily told to leave behind the
imposing delegation of businessmen that was to accompany him, and
to come for just one day instead of five, will undoubtedly be sent
home with an unnerving scolding.
</P>
<P>
   All this too, on the eve of a special Green party conference
that at the very least will vent fierce misgivings at the war _
misgivings now shared by a section of the Chancellor's own Social
Democrat Party.
</P>
<P>
   If public skepticism in Britain is starting to grow, in Germany
it is becoming deafening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ground war which offers the best guarantee of NATO
securing its five points, looks less likely than ever. If the
Kosovo refugees are to start going home before the winter, a land
operation must start by the end of July at the latest.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, despite an extra 1,000 troops here, an extra 2000
there, no coherent buildup appears to have even begun. Given the
required lead time of at least two months, May 31 constitutes a
kind of deadline. Almost certainly, it will not be met. &QL;

   ``A kind of Catch-22 prevails,'' notes Anatole Lieven of the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. ``The air
war is becoming increasingly unpopular, but _ with the possible
exception of Britain _ no one is getting more enthusiastic about a
ground war.''
</P>
<P>
   That bleak analysis applies above all to the U.S., without whose
participation a ground war is inconceivable. &QL;

<P>
   Alas, malicious fate has also decreed that America's leader
should be a man disqualified by his own record from leading the
country into a conflict where lives will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   So the chimera will be pursued, of a war which must be won
comprehensively, but without Western casualties. Ineluctably, the
trail is leading to the U.N., whose cover even NATO countries
accept is essential for the diplomatic endgame to be played out.
</P>
<P>
   Short of popular uprising in Belgrade, or a bomb on Milosevic as
lucky as the one on the Chinese embassy was unlucky, it is far
harder to construct a scenario for NATO securing the terms it is
demanding.
</P>
<P>
   Almost impudently, Slobodan Milosevic, responsible for savagery
unknown in Europe for 50 years, ignores the West's demands for a
strongly armed, NATO-led peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   His latest offer, relayed via Yasushi Akashi, the former U.N.
envoy to Yugoslavia, apparently is acceptance of a U.N.-led force,
lightly armed, and containing no soldiers from NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   The allies doggedly insist that American, British and French
forces will be at its core, but even with an ambiguous U.N.
resolution, the chances of their having their way have surely been
diminished by the events of the last 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy, has
acquired fresh weight. Subtly, he has been transformed from NATO's
mailman to Milosevic, into a potential independent peacemaker, with
new room to navigate between the two sides _ his own calls for an
end to the bombing now reinforced by the president of distant
China. &QL;

   NATO may yet prevail. But a trio of bombs on a building in

   &UR; Q: WHY HAVE THE CHINESE TURNED AGAINST THEIR FORMER ALBANIAN
COMRADES? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: The stoning of the Albanian embassy in Beijing by Chinese
protesters would have astonished Albania's former leader, Enver
Hoxha. Furious with Nikita Khrushchev's liberalizing policies in
the Soviet Union, and with his attacks on Stalin, Albania's former
Communist dictator for four decades made Tirana a lonely Maoist
outpost in the Russian-dominated Communist bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically the KLA guerrillas fighting Serb troops in Kosovo are
often still using the atrociously poor quality guns that China's
Chairman Mao Tse-Tung supplied to his Albanian ally.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing remains of the strange Chinese-Albanian alliance.
After Mao's death, and China's tentative moves towards
liberalization, Albania was left alone to carry the banner for
Stalinist orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   And after Hoxha died in 1985 and the Communist system collapsed
in 1990, Albania turned to the West.
</P>
<P>
   China, meanwhile, has also radically changed its Balkan
priorities. While Yugoslavia's Marshal Tito lived, it despised his
brand of Communism as a heresy. But today it cherishes Yugoslavia
as an ally against America.
</P>
<P>
   In the wars that have pitted Belgrade against secessionists in
Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, Beijing staunchly supported the
central government against breakaway forces. Now Beijing is furious
with Albania for encouraging the West to intervene militarily in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: DO ALBANIANS LOOK LIKE SERBS? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: No. Of course the differences are only approximate but it is
often very easy to tell a Serb from an Albanian in Kosovo long
before he or she opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs often have black or dark brown hair and are generally
darker and more heavily built than Albanians. Their appearance is
fairly typical of southern Slavs.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Kosovars look Celtic. They have curly hair,
which is often blonde or rust-colored, and their skin tends to be
very pale and covered in freckles. Their eyes are often green or
blue and their build is much more slender than that of the Serbs.
They have longer heads.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that they look so different as they belong
to different races that have very rarely intermarried. &QL;

<P>
   LONDON _ If a week is a long time in politics, 36 hours is an
eternity in war.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, the West achieved its biggest diplomatic
success since the Kosovo conflict began, drawing Russia into the
outline of a deal which could force Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic to his knees.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Friday night, an errant NATO missile scored the most
devastating target imaginable _ a direct hit on the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   At a stroke the painstaking feat of the diplomats had been at
the least imperiled, conceivably reduced to as much rubble as
China's mission.
</P>
<P>
   The war that, after almost seven weeks, had seemed to be gaining
a purpose, now appeared to be back to bombing for bombing's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 200 extra American warplanes are being sent to the
front-line, in furtherance of an implausible strategy of blowing up
power stations, bridges (and now foreign embassies) in the name of
saving a province in the south of Yugoslavia that had already been
reduced to an almost uninhabited wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   In NATO capitals and on the floor of the U.N. in New York, the
diplomats and politicians who should have been concentrating on
building a watertight accord with the Russians have been forced to
devote their energies to apologizing.
</P>
<P>
   And not just for the debacle at the Chinese embassy. Obscured by
Saturday's diplomatic pandemonium was the small matter of the
cluster bombing which killed a dozen people in a residential area
in Nis, the third largest city of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   This is, however absurdly, supposed to be a ``humane'' bombing
campaign. But for the distraction of the embassy hit, more people
might have asked why NATO was using cluster bombs designed to
terrorize and kill people _ and not on a battlefield, but close to
a densely populated civilian area.
</P>
<P>
   NATO now can only hope that indignation at its dreadful blunder
will quickly subside, allowing the diplomatic process to resume.
That may yet happen. But the process was never going to be simple.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement in principle reached in Germany by the foreign
ministers of the Group of Seven leading Western powers and Russia
is merely a road map to a settlement, which omits a host of hazards
along the way.
</P>
<P>
   It could be several weeks before a detailed offer is ready to
present to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Nonetheless, the
satisfaction etched on the faces of British Foreign Minister Robin
Cook and his colleagues on Thursday as they left the imposing
Petersberg residence, high above the Rhine near Bonn, was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   It is not because they possess nuclear weapons, or because they
might join the war on Yugoslavia's side, or because they are the
one country Milosevic listens to, that the Russians matter in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They matter because they hold the key which opens the door to
U.N. involvement in the crisis. From the outset it was clear, even
to NATO hawks such as Britain, that a lasting Kosovo settlement
could only come under the aegis of the U.N. That, however, meant
heading off the threat of a Russian veto in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the G8 deal has done this. The road map no longer
points to endless NATO bombing, followed by a creeping occupation
of Kosovo, of dubious international legality. Instead, a
copper-bottomed U.N. resolution beckons, perhaps within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If Serbia is to lose Kosovo, Russia as well as Milosevic would
far prefer to lose it to an ``interim'' mandate of the U.N. than to
a de facto NATO protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   But now everything is more uncertain. The real question is not
the destination, but whether the road to it is passable. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 625. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Petersberg was a major setback for Milosevic. If he had banked
on using the Russians as a diplomatic shield against the need to
make concessions, he had miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the Russian shift were equally clear. Virtually
isolated in its previous support for Serbia, Moscow would have had
scant chance of securing the international financial aid it so
desperately needs, had it persisted in blocking progress.
</P>
<P>
   Far less clear was whether the price of getting the Russians on
board was too high _ whether unity on the U.N. Security Council
perforce means a fudge that lets Milosevic off the hook, and hands
NATO a ``victory'' that is really a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The strike on the Chinese embassy has redoubled these
uncertainties. Russia may be less inclined to cooperate, and now
Peking's veto power on the U.N. Security Council is a factor which
must be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   Even harder to quantify is the effect on public opinion;
conceivably, Friday night's debacle could contribute to a fatal
undermining of support for the war.
</P>
<P>
   The details too will be tricky, none more so than the makeup of
the peacekeeping force that will move into Kosovo and shepherd
700,000 or more returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   By speaking of ``effective international civil and security
presences,'' the foreign ministers left the question open. But a
gulf remains between the positions of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Though the alliance agrees that the force may be designated a
U.N. force, it is adamant that at its heart must be NATO troops,
wielding heavy NATO firepower, working within an exclusively NATO
command structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as that's understood, it doesn't matter what we call
the force,'' a senior alliance diplomat says, citing the example of
the SFOR contingent, U.N.-wrapped but NATO-filled, which has kept
the peace in Bosnia for four years.
</P>
<P>
   From Belgrade, however, there have been only hints of
acknowledgement that an armed international force is inevitable _
and not the slightest sign that a single NATO soldier should be
allowed in its number.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, said on Thursday that
Yugoslavia must approve the composition of whatever force does move
in, an indication perhaps that Moscow's conversion to Western
arguments is less than complete. And that was before the Chinese
embassy strike.
</P>
<P>
   All hinges on the fudge word ``effective,'' apparently inserted
by Cook to ensure an agreed outcome. But when the drafters start
writing a U.N. resolution and its detailed annexes, the issue will
have to be confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and Ivanov were to have met in Edinburgh this weekend, and
might have sorted it out, but the bombing in Belgrade has blown
their talks away. &QL;

<P>
   It could be several weeks before a detailed offer is ready to
present to Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. Nonetheless, the
satisfaction etched on the faces of British Foreign Minister Robin
Cook and his colleagues on Thursday as they left the imposing
Petersberg residence, high above the Rhine near Bonn, was
justified.
</P>
<P>
   It is not because they possess nuclear weapons, or because they
might join the war on Yugoslavia's side, or because they are the
one country Milosevic listens to, that the Russians matter in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They matter because they hold the key which opens the door to
U.N. involvement in the crisis. From the outset it was clear, even
to NATO hawks such as Britain, that a lasting Kosovo settlement
could only come under the aegis of the U.N. That, however, meant
heading off the threat of a Russian veto in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, the G8 deal has done this. The road map no longer
points to endless NATO bombing, followed by a creeping occupation
of Kosovo, of dubious international legality. Instead, a
copper-bottomed U.N. resolution beckons, perhaps within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   If Serbia is to lose Kosovo, Russia as well as Milosevic would
far prefer to lose it to an ``interim'' mandate of the U.N. than to
a de facto NATO protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   But now everything is more uncertain. The real question is not
the destination, but whether the road to it is passable. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 625. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   Petersberg was a major setback for Milosevic. If he had banked
on using the Russians as a diplomatic shield against the need to
make concessions, he had miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the Russian shift were equally clear. Virtually
isolated in its previous support for Serbia, Moscow would have had
scant chance of securing the international financial aid it so
desperately needs, had it persisted in blocking progress.
</P>
<P>
   Far less clear was whether the price of getting the Russians on
board was too high _ whether unity on the U.N. Security Council
perforce means a fudge that lets Milosevic off the hook, and hands
NATO a ``victory'' that is really a defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The strike on the Chinese embassy has redoubled these
uncertainties. Russia may be less inclined to cooperate, and now
Peking's veto power on the U.N. Security Council is a factor which
must be taken into account.
</P>
<P>
   Even harder to quantify is the effect on public opinion;
conceivably, Friday night's debacle could contribute to a fatal
undermining of support for the war.
</P>
<P>
   The details too will be tricky, none more so than the makeup of
the peacekeeping force that will move into Kosovo and shepherd
700,000 or more returning refugees.
</P>
<P>
   By speaking of ``effective international civil and security
presences,'' the foreign ministers left the question open. But a
gulf remains between the positions of the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Though the alliance agrees that the force may be designated a
U.N. force, it is adamant that at its heart must be NATO troops,
wielding heavy NATO firepower, working within an exclusively NATO
command structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as that's understood, it doesn't matter what we call
the force,'' a senior alliance diplomat says, citing the example of
the SFOR contingent, U.N.-wrapped but NATO-filled, which has kept
the peace in Bosnia for four years.
</P>
<P>
   From Belgrade, however, there have been only hints of
acknowledgement that an armed international force is inevitable _
and not the slightest sign that a single NATO soldier should be
allowed in its number.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Ivanov, the Russian foreign minister, said on Thursday that
Yugoslavia must approve the composition of whatever force does move
in, an indication perhaps that Moscow's conversion to Western
arguments is less than complete. And that was before the Chinese
embassy strike.
</P>
<P>
   All hinges on the fudge word ``effective,'' apparently inserted
by Cook to ensure an agreed outcome. But when the drafters start
writing a U.N. resolution and its detailed annexes, the issue will
have to be confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Cook and Ivanov were to have met in Edinburgh this weekend, and
might have sorted it out, but the bombing in Belgrade has blown
their talks away. &QL;

   BRUSSELS _ Europe has put a price of up to $3.5 billion on
rebuilding Kosovo, and highlighted the need for immediate
preparations so that reconstruction can start as soon as there is a
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission has also estimated that the cost of
catering for the 700,000 refugees in the region will range from
$340 million to $780 million, depending on the length of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they expected Europe to provide 50-60 percent of
the funds, a figure in line with the aid given to Bosnia after the
1992-95 war.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's meeting of finance ministers several governments,
including that of Holland, argued that the money should come from
within existing spending plans _ the first indications of the
political sensitivities surrounding the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission's analysis points to one central difficulty in
channelling aid to Kosovo and to the republic of Montenegro, which
has taken in about 70,000 refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since neither is a sovereign country, neither is eligible for
membership of the International Monetary Fund and hence not for
membership of the World Bank,'' the report says.
</P>
<P>
   The document puts the estimated costs of reconstruction in
Kosovo at ``$2-3.5 billion over perhaps three years.''
</P>
<P>
   It warns: ``Since Kosovo is likely to enjoy a significant degree
of political and administrative autonomy, significant resources
will have to be directed to rehabilitate or create from scratch the
necessary institutions within the territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The report says economic assistance may need to extend to
countries, such as Romania and Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   It adds: ``Preparations should begin immediately so that, as
soon as there is cease-fire the EU and the rest of the
international community is able to put in place within a short
space of time a priority reconstruction programme with financing
assured for at least the first three months and committed for the
first year.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   In any war, the wrong targets are going to be hit and civilians
are going to be killed, but in this war the misjudgements and
mistakes just keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is one building in Belgrade we would like not to have
hit, it was the Chinese embassy,'' a Foreign Office official
admitted on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not simply a matter of faulty intelligence. The use of
cluster bombs _ which are designed to maximize casualties _ in a
residential area of Nis was a terrible mistake. The bombing of the
Serbian television station likewise, and that was a quite
deliberate target.
</P>
<P>
   This was the biggest blunder yet, however, because it threatens
the diplomatic house of cards so carefully constructed over the
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The wooing of the Russians last week had a twin purpose: to
sideline Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's only significant
external ally, and to remove the Russian veto on the U.N. Security
Council, thus allowing U.N. authorization for ground forces in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But that, in turn, depended on the Chinese veto staying out of
the fray. The assumption was that China would not block NATO if
Russia did not, but that was always a doubtful assessment.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership has its own particular reasons for
regarding as sacrosanct the principle of non-interference in the
internal affairs of sovereign states. It is especially keen to keep
the sensitive issue of Tibet out of the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is no hope at all of Chinese acquiescence at the U.N.
in the short term, as the government in Beijing tries to ride the
anger of its own people _ not that there is anything especially
oriental or inscrutable about it.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the British (or American) response if China had
accidentally killed three people in one of our embassies.
</P>
<P>
   All of Tony Blair's kowtowing to Zhu Rongji, the Chinese premier
whom our prime minister described as a fellow modernizer, is
unlikely to weigh much in the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Britain helped to block a resolution
attacking China's human rights record at a United Nations
conference in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   And last week Downing Street made it clear that when Blair met
the Dalai Lama, they would be talking about reincarnation and
Christian-Buddhist relations, and definitely not the ``doctrine of
international community,'' as outlined by the prime minister in an
important speech in Chicago last month.
</P>
<P>
   Funny that, because the parallels between the situation in
Kosovo and that in Tibet are inescapable. Indeed, the case for
intervening in Tibet is rather stronger.
</P>
<P>
   It was, unlike Kosovo, a sovereign nation, annexed in 1951. It
does not contain religious sites of national significance to the
Chinese. And its national leader has pursued a model campaign of
nonviolence in pursuit of independence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it must be said that the Western failure to press the
cause of Tibet in no way undermines the moral foundations of the
attempt to halt ``ethnic cleansing'' in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most important sub-clauses of the Blair doctrine is
the recognition that the failure to do good in one part of the
world does not excuse inaction in another.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wanted to right every wrong that we see in the modern
world then we would do little else than intervene in the affairs of
other countries,'' as Blair put it in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That is absolutely right, and the complaint from the likes of
playwright Harold Pinter that the West should not act to defend the
Kosovar Albanians because it did nothing for the Kurds or the
Rwandan Tutsis should be robustly rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But the sub-clause cannot be extended to the point where the
West is selling out the rights of the Tibetans in order to keep
China on board for U.N. action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Blair should have taken a more robust line on Tibet. He could
have argued that a policy of pragmatic appeasement was more likely
to produce results.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. The bombing of the Chinese embassy of Belgrade has
not simply set back the cause in Kosovo: it threatens the cause of
human rights in China and Tibet as well. &QL;

<P>
   British Foreign Minister Robin Cook said Saturday that it was
one of the tragic accidents of war, but the NATO bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade was more than that.
</P>
<P>
   It was an act of monumental incompetence in a war that has been
characterized from the start by military bungling and political
cowardice _ or, in the case of Tony Blair, political recklessness.
</P>
<P>
   This war began in folly, it has proceeded in folly, and now,
following the G8 meeting on Thursday, looks as though it may end
not in outright victory for NATO but in a peace settlement with
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   However humiliating, a peace deal is better than a war that has
aggravated the very evil it sought to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of the embassy, while shocking, should not have
surprised us unduly, however. Most of NATO's bombs have found their
targets, but too many have not.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence sources must have known that the Chinese embassy
was dangerously close to its Friday night targets, and that the
embassy staff were living as well as working there.
</P>
<P>
   There could have been few more sensitive sites. China is a
permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, whose support
Western leaders decided last week they needed if they were to make
their new seven-point peace plan acceptable to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   As a permanent member, China has veto rights on any U.N.
decision. Until now the assumption was that Peking would not
exercise it.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Chinese government has been especially
hostile to the NATO action in Yugoslavia; with its own troops
occupying Tibet, it does not relish the precedent of the West
intervening inside other people's national boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese public opinion is behind its government; the Chinese
press depicts President Bill Clinton with a Hitler moustache and
points out that the words Nato and Nazi are similar in spelling.
</P>
<P>
   But China usually exercises its veto only when its national
interests are directly threatened. It was assumed that the Russians
could persuade the Chinese to, at least, stay silent in the
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's bombs may have shattered more than an embassy
building. And the longer the bombing continues, the more
complicated things will become.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs have resolved nothing. As we predicted at the
beginning of this war, they have failed utterly in their original
intention of preventing a humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has little credibility left. There can be no justification
for the use of cluster bombs, and none for hitting TV stations,
electricity plants and other targets that will deprive the ordinary
people of Serbia food, fuel and heat.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO has had to resort to nonviolent measures, like the oil
embargo and the diplomatic moves to bring Russia on side, which
ought to have been tried before the bombers were scrambled.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has not come well out of all this. His government last
week passed the second anniversary of its arrival in office. Such a
milestone ought to have been the occasion for a measured review of
his not inconsiderable achievements.
</P>
<P>
   His party, though it lost seats in the local elections, retained
a percentage of the vote which was enviable for this point in the
lifetime of a parliament.
</P>
<P>
   His policy in Northern Ireland, though a settlement has proved
elusive, maintains the peace, which is no small accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   His handling of Europe has, with a few exceptions, proved
sure-footed. He has followed through on devolution, though we have
yet to see how willing he will prove to cede control behind the
scenes. His approach to welfare reform seems generally sound.
</P>
<P>
   But any review of the comparative successes of his first two
years must now be overshadowed by the way he has propelled the
country into what may prove its greatest foreign policy blunder
since Suez.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has been a hawk among the Western leaders. U.S. President
Bill Clinton has constantly cast one eye back to a reluctant
Congress, and an American public among which what little support
there ever was for ground troops has fallen away.
</P>
<P>
   The German Chancellor has hesitated too, as public opinion
becomes increasingly hostile to the bombing. Only Blair's
hawkishness seems to have increased as the conflict has progressed.
</P>
<P>
   The day before the embassy bombs fell his vocabulary got even
stronger; he made repeated comparisons to ``Hitler's evil regime''
and talked of Victory in Europe Day and the challenge our parents'
generation faced.
</P>
<P>
   He could not, he later said, see a future for Serbia under
Milosevic _ against whom he said there was ``serious evidence'' of
war crimes. ``I'm not sitting down and dealing with Milosevic,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   All this is an unwarranted gamble. Important differences of
detail remained unresolved in the G8's document of ``seven agreed
principles.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible of course that Milosevic might back down; if so
it will probably be Russian diplomacy which is accorded the
success.
</P>
<P>
   A second option is that Milosevic might remain defiant, deciding
like Saddam Hussein that a military defeat could bring him domestic
political victory; for the hawks of NATO that might secure the
reverse _ military victory but political defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely now is some kind of fudge. That's where we are after
seven weeks of bombing, God knows how many deaths and the creation
of almost a million refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The war should never have been launched, as we have argued from
the start. Serbia, of course, cannot win in all this, but it is not
inconceivable that the hawks of NATO, Blair foremost among them,
might yet lose. &QL;

MARTIN SWIVELS TO TOP WITH NEW CD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could there be a person in a better position for world
domination (besides George Lucas) than Latin heartthrob Ricky
Martin?
</P>
<P>
   Martin was already an international superstar before his
hip-swiveling, career-boosting performance of ``The Cup of Life``
at February's Grammy Awards, where he also took home the best Latin
pop performance trophy for his 6 million-selling ''Vuelve'' album.
After that electrifying night, Martin's publicity machine cranked
into high gear. Madonna _ and the rest of the English-speaking
world _ soon came calling.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the former Menudo member is poised to sprint ahead of pop's
current crop of teen idols _ 'N Sync, Britney Spears, Backstreet
Boys _ with ``Ricky Martin'' (C2 Records/Columbia), his confident
and energetic English-language debut album. Besides high-profile
appearances on MTV and ``Saturday Night Live'', Martin's first
English-language single, ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' has already hit
No. 1 on the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive crop of producers was assembled for ``Ricky
Martin,'' including crossover guru Emilio Estefan Jr., Robi Rosa,
Desmond Child (best known for his work with Bon Jovi and
Aerosmith), Walter Afanasieff and William Orbit, the moody
mastermind behind Madonna's ``Ray of Light.''
</P>
<P>
   The album reflects that diversity, showcasing hot Latin
percussion, blaring guitars and horns and emotive power ballads.
Everything, however, seems geared for maximum radio play. The album
even includes Spanglish remixes of ``The Cup of Life'' (featured in
a better, pulsing version on ``Vuelve''), and ``Maria,'' a 1995
dance hit.
</P>
<P>
   That attention to success occasionally lapses into Jon
Secada-like sappiness, particularly on the droopy love songs ``You
Stay With Me'' and``She's All I Ever Had'' (also featured in a
superior Spanish version). The latter was co-written by Secada and
also features the faded singer on background vocals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; For the most part, though, ``Ricky Martin'' is ablaze with his
trademark sexiness. The current single, ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' is
a perfect introduction to Martin's sound _ wailing, enthusiastic
vocals and a non-stop barrage of sounds, including '60s-tinged
guitar licks and spy-movie riffs.
</P>
<P>
   That swaggering confidence carries over to a few of the album's
other high-energy numbers, including the breezy and tropical
``Spanish Eyes,'' an ode to a mysterious dream girl; and ``Shake
Your Bon-Bon,'' which generates considerable heat despite its
cutesy title, thanks to Martin's confident delivery and the
irresistibly catchy lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   On his Spanish-language discs, Martin often played the part of
hopeless romantic. He continues the trend here, teaming up with
Swedish labelmate Meja (``It's All About The Money``) on ''Private
Emotion,`` a sparkling, hopeful ballad that seems destined to pop
up on a summer movie soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   More adventurous is the soaring ``I Am Made of You,'' which
Martin says reflects his much-publicized search for spirituality,
but the album's best cut _ unsurprisingly _ is the lush and
atmospheric ``Be Careful'' (Cuidado Con Mi Corazon), Martin's duet
with Madonna. Producers Madonna and Orbit wrap the song in silky
electronica grooves accented by flamenco guitars as the singers
gently coo bilingual lyrics. The sense of romance achieved here
shines a sensual light on Martin that the rest of this brightly
colored collection only hints at.

Belgrade confirms the first law of those who adhere to the screw-up
theory in life: the more sophisticated the means at hand (in this
case the intelligence-gathering capability of the CIA), the more
elementary is likely to be the inevitable mistake (in this case, it
would appear, relying on an out-of-date map).

   On Thursday afternoon, the West achieved its biggest diplomatic
success since the Kosovo conflict began, drawing Russia into the
outline of a deal which ideally would force Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic to his knees.

   Late on Friday night, an errant NATO missile scored its most
devastating target imaginable _ a direct hit on the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade.

IN REFUGEE CAMPS, SLEUTHING LOST RELATIVES IS A MUST

<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ She was allowed one call, one minute, and she
knew by heart the number to dial. Deep in a line of refugees
grasping slips of paper and old address books, Xhemile Goqaj hoped
that her mother and father had the same number with them, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Goqaj found out she was the first, so far the only, one of
her family to telephone a brother who works in Switzerland. In
those precious 60 seconds, she learned that a cousin had been
killed in Kosovo, but not whether her parents and another brother
were alive. She hung up, not knowing when or how she might be able
to call again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called to say I am alive and I am here and I don't know
where anyone else is,'' said Goqaj, who, together with her husband
and mother-in-law, had fled their home on a moment's notice.
``Maybe they killed them. I don't know. Maybe they are looking for
me. I need to find them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sent running from their Kosovo villages in opposite directions,
separated at international borders, divided in Macedonian refugee
camps, tens of thousands of refugees are now searching for each
other as well as hoping to be found.
</P>
<P>
   Their tools can be as old-fashioned as word of mouth and as
sophisticated as the satellite phones provided by the International
Red Cross and a Washington-based company called Iridium. Some are
relying on luck, others on determination. But with more than
400,000 refugees in Albania alone, and who knows how many on the
move inside Kosovo, the tearful reunions tend to require a bit of
both. Relief workers also say the odds worsen each time a sibling
or uncle relocates by choice or by force.
</P>
<P>
   Forced overnight to become amateur sleuths, some have set out by
foot and by bus, going camp to camp, tent to tent, mattress to
mattress. Like Xhevdet Kajtazi, who had expected to spend the
spring preparing for his high school graduation, they ask the same
question again and again: Have you seen my family? Until the sixth
town he reached, no one could tell the 17-year-old what he wanted
to hear. Then an aquaintance from home pointed to a tent in Kukes,
just inside Albania near the Kosovo border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not believe they were there. I had hoped, but _'' said
Kajtazi, who only the other day got word in Tirana that one missing
brother had been killed, but that another was in hiding in Kosovo
safe and _ so far. ``In the beginning, I thought for sure they were
all dead from grenades. So I asked and asked for them everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Many more Kosovars, however, appear to be staying put. The ones
who know where to register have had their names and locations
broadcast on local and international radio programs and printed in
Albanian newspapers. With so many Albanians working in Switzerland
and Germany, most everyone also wants a chance to try one of the
fancy international phones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Red Cross has helped place more than 6,500
one-minute calls. An Iridium executive temporarily staying in
Tirana said the company's 50 phones are being used day and night
for three-minute calls. Other ethnic Albanians are buying calling
cards and lining up at pay phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been stripped of their identity, but
everyone comes out with a little piece of paper with a phone number
on it,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Daloni Carlisle. ``Or they've
written it on an arm or on their belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlisle sees the 65 parents who had registered with the Red
Cross as having lost their children, and the 51 children officially
looking for their parents, as ``the very small tip of a very large
iceberg.'' More than 3,500 have had their names broadcast on radio,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But anecdotal happy endings aside, those are brief, one-shot
attempts. If no one picks up the phone on the other end, if no one
hears the broadcast, many refugees fear they will never find their
way back to each other, now that their homes have been destroyed.
Entire villages have vanished, making it all but impossible to
return quickly even if peace is achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Huddled in the bleachers of a Tirana sports arena, converted
into a human warehouse filled with wall-to-wall mattresses and the
odor of desperation, Bademe Thaqi kept close the young daughter she
still has. Her older daughter, 17 and seven months pregnant, is
somewhere else, and Thaqi has no idea where that might be. All she
can do, she said, is hope that her daughter thinks to call
Switzerland, where Thaqi's husband works and where she has already
checked in by pay phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope maybe she and her husband will find out to come to
Albania,'' said Thaqi, 36, who managed to stay together with her
parents, sister and 13-year-old son all the way from Postasel,
Kosovo, to Tirana. ``But there is no phone in the village, maybe no
village anymore, so how will she find out?''
</P>
<P>
   Rimi, a 16-year-old from the Kosovo capital of Pristina, has
given up on the idea of ever finding anyone related to him. The
sports arena has been home since April 1, and he has registered
everywhere he can. His name and location have been aired on radio.
He thinks they were in the newspaper. With the faraway look of the
lonely, he noted that some of the aid workers at the nearby Red
Cross office now know him by his first name.
</P>
<P>
   Rimi, who did not want his full name used, had expected to end
up with his parents. He was in one car in a 70-car convoy leaving
Pristina, they were in another. But Serbian soldiers in black masks
stopped the caravan and began issuing arbitrary commands: this car
to Macedonia, that to Montenegro, those to Albania. Rimi has not
seen his family since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just started crying right there and one Serb police says to
me, `If you don't stop crying I will kill you,' '' Rimi said. ``I
am too scared of spending the rest of my life alone. Before this I
have great hopes, but now I am hopeless. I have tried everything
and it's still just me.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mullet, a tent city on the outskirts of Tirana with about
1,300 refugees, a line of people in tattered clothes snaked its way
around a Red Cross vehicle. On their faces they wore hope. The
relief agency had brought a satellite phone to the camp for the
first time _ the first time most of the ethnic Albanians had a
chance to call out, since the camp phone is for incoming calls
only.
</P>
<P>
   Within two hours, perhaps 10 refugees had connected with
relatives, said aid worker Ellen Verluyt. Many more got busy
signals, or no answers, or the wrong answers. The number to Germany
that one man had carried so many miles belonged to a woman who said
she did not know any Albanians of any kind. In the second it took
Verluyt to explain, the hope on his face vanished and was replaced
by panic. Later Carlisle said the Red Cross will try to track down
correct numbers on the spot if there is time and no crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's not so easy,'' Verluyt said. ``But if you've
got family abroad, you've got at least a chance at your connection.
. . I don't think you can just go looking for someone, but I think
they're doing whatever they can.''

easy one. But the roller coaster ride of the last 20 years, jolted
recently by allegations of espionage and recriminations over trade
and human rights, has done what few observers imagined possible:
taken a nosedive.
</P>
<P>
   After years of improvements in relations despite fits and
starts, the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
threatens to drag relations to one of the lowest points since
diplomatic ties were established 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other scandals and allegations, of illegal campaign donations
and leaked satellite technology, have dogged leaders on both sides
and have become political footballs, but were largely ignored by
the public. Even the Chinese missile crisis of 1996, when the
United States sent aircraft carriers to protect Taiwan, was viewed
in Beijing mainly as a standoff with Taiwan, not as a conflict with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But the NATO bombing that killed three and wounded a score of
Chinese citizens has sparked universal outrage in China, with
massive protests and near-riots against US targets continuing for
the third day Monday. For that reason alone, it will be far harder
for Washington to repair the damage done to an already rocky
relationship _ or for Beijing to accept an apology and still save
face with its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that this is the worst point
since the normalization of Sino-US relations 20 years ago,'' said
Richard Baum, a political scientist at the University of California
at Los Angeles. ``Things will get worse before they get better. If
they get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the US-led NATO bombing may become for China what
the 1989 massacre of student protesters around Tiananmen Square
became for the United States: a transgression serious enough to
freeze relations, and a stick to beat the other side with for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, from the White House, President Clinton offered a fresh
apology for the bombing. ``I apologize. I regret this. I think it
is very important to draw a clear distinction between a tragic
mistake and ethnic cleansing'' carried out by Serbians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the unrivaled reputation of the US military for
technological wizardry has made it hard not only for ordinary
Chinese, but also for America watchers and policymakers in China,
to believe the bombing was accidental. Without a significant effort
by Washington and NATO to make amends, an apparently accidental
strike could undermine years of hard work in what may be the most
important bilateral relationship of the coming decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some backward country could make such a mistake, but the
US is so efficient,'' said Xiong Zhiyong, dean of international
studies at Foreign Affairs College in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Xiong suggested the United States should offer reparations for
the victims and to rebuild the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   China, of course, would hardly be averse to playing the bombing
for diplomatic advantage. Frequent reminders of NATO's tragic error
could force the United States to ease its criticism of China on
human rights and arms proliferation, and grant concessions for
China's admission to the World Trade Organization. The incident has
already diverted attention away from China's alleged theft of
technology and supposed scheme to influence US elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese love to have some weapon to beat you over the head
with in later negotiations, and this is a pretty good one,'' said
Don Klein, an Asian specialist and retired professor of politics at
Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western analysts predicted the two nations will ride out
the storm, mainly because commercial ties have become too lucrative
to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   China is one of the largest trading partners of the United
States, raking in a $57 billion trade surplus with the United
States last year, meaning a downturn in relations would not help
either side. The vitriolic protests have prompted some American
businesses to send employees out of China. Monday, Boeing, Chubb
and Rockwell International kept Beijing offices closed, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese scholars said Westerners should not be surprised by
the violent protests; it is hard to overstate the visceral reaction
among Chinese to an attack by Western powers who have a history of
subjugating or isolating China. A history of imperialism and
colonization has left Chinese sensitive to perceived bullying or
attacks on China's sovereignty. Some analysts fear relations could
degenerate to a renewed Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for China what Tiananmen was for the US,'' a
relationship deal-breaker, Xiong said.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, China announced Monday it would suspend talks with
the United States on human rights, arms control and international
security. It was a largely symbolic gesture, because talks on those
issues are mostly stalled anyway. The bombing could be a convenient
excuse for China to halt discussion on uncomfortable issues, but
Western analysts said the action was the minimum Beijing had to
take, considering the Chinese public's demands for retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the bodies of the victims of the NATO strike are
expected to return to Beijing, and a memorial service will probably
stoke public emotions.
</P>
<P>
   The protests take place less than a month before the 10th
anniversary of the June 4, 1989, massacre of student protesters in
Tiananmen Square. May 4 was the 80th anniversary of the student
movement for democracy and science and against imperialism.
Analysts said the timing could not be worse for the government,
which risks backlash if it blocks demonstrations, but fears
unabated protests could turn against the leadership.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is bad news for leaders on both sides who had been
working to improve relations. Anti-US sentiment may serve to
marginalize reformers in the Chinese leadership such as Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji, who is seen as soft on Washington for granting
concessions during WTO negotiations. Zhu's visit to the United
States last month was a much-hailed, albeit minor advance in
relations, but any gains from that went up in smoke with the
bombing. Some protest banners have demanded that Zhu resign.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis is the latest in the years that Washington and
Beijing have attempted to repair decades of antagonism. In the
1950s, the United States and China fought in Korea. In the 1960's
China assisted North Vietnam in its fight against the United
States. The 1970s brought ping-pong diplomacy and a Sino-US united
front against the Soviet Union. With the 1980s came the opening of
China's economy. That all changed with the massacre of 1989, which
halted military ties and loans, and catapulted human rights to the
top of the agenda, said David Zweig, a China specialist at Hong
Kong University of Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
   In the post-Cold War era, the United States no longer needs
China as a counterbalance to a Soviet threat, but neither does
China need the United States as anti-Soviet wedge, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more complicated relationship now,'' Zweig said.
``The Chinese feel the US wants to rule the world. It's a period of
growing power and nationalism in China _ and increasing fear in the
US of rising Chinse power.''

PHOTO EXHIBIT CAPTURES AMERICA'S CENTURY, WITH A TWIST 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  _
 By DAVID BERNARD  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica didn't make the cut. Neither did the sailor
kissing the nurse in Times Square. Or the South Vietnamese general
executing a Viet Cong operative during Tet. Or the astronaut
standing on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Picturing the Century: One Hundred Years of
Photography from the National Archives,'' which opened here in
March, includes surprisingly few of the pictures that a visitor
with a head full of best-of-the-century lists would expect to see.
</P>
<P>
   What it does include is 200 images of America during its first
fully angle than you're used to. Which is exactly what curator
Bruce Bustard had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain images become icons beyond just capturing a moment,''
said Bustard, a federal archivist. ``They're part of our collective
memory.'' The problem with these greatest hits is, they're so
familiar that we no longer really see them.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Bustard avoided the century's most famous
fractions-of-seconds as he selected photos from the eight
million-plus in the National Archives and Records Administration's
collection.
</P>
<P>
   As he began preparing the exhibition in 1997, he had already
decided on many of the images that would represent events and
photographers. While he admitted his list was limited, he also said
it was the only option.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way you can go through eight million pictures,''
Bustard said. ``You wouldn't want to'' _ especially since many of
the archives' photos are purely informational, depicting machinery,
land surveys, agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing only from this federal library also afforded him
different perspectives. Unlike the news media's more publicized
images, the archives' photos were taken by government photographers
to document the work of agencies, social programs, the military,
and official ceremonies, depicting America in its everyday moments.
</P>
<P>
   Arranged chronologically along the archives' Circular Gallery _
which curves behind the hall where the Declaration of Independence,
Constitution and Bill of Rights are displayed _ the photographs are
mostly sharp black-and-white until the exhibition's last quarter,
when the standardization of color film processing in the mid-1960s
becomes apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The photos range from turn-of-the-century panoramas of bustling
street scenes and sprawling farm landscapes, to President George
Bush among American troops in Saudi Arabia during Thanksgiving
1990, to President Bill Clinton playing a saxophone, to a beaming
President Boris Yeltsin of Russia at a 1994 summit.
</P>
<P>
   Often the scene is familiar history from a unique angle, since
the government photographer was not among the rest of the press.
American soldiers wade into the surf and German gunfire at Normandy
beach, as seen from the Coast Guard landing boat they have just
left. President Richard Nixon bids the White House farewell, as
seen from inside the helicopter he is boarding.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's an unfamiliar photo that connects the familiar
ones. A 1913 assembly line. A 1965 portrait of a young Marine
standing by during a troop arrival at Da Nang shows his uncertainty
weighing as heavily as the duffel he carries.
</P>
<P>
   Other times a renowned photographer puts a signature style to
work for Uncle Sam. Dorothea Lange's pictures of Depression
breadlines and children peeking out of shanties extend an influence
felt by anyone who's ever seen a ``Save the Children'' television
commercial, and Ansel Adams's landscapes of the American West are
echoed in the best nature and travel magazines.
</P>
<P>
   In photography, government work often means undistinguished
``grip-and-grin'' handshakes. ``For a government photographer, it's
harder to have a point of view,'' Bustard said. These photographs
contain a surprising range of emotion, though. There's fairy-tale
wonder in the shot of a mother and daughter in a sparkling white
1950s kitchen, an image that ran in a propaganda magazine sent to
the Soviet Union. There's the vaguely sinister inner-city teen-ager
leaning against an alley wall, from a study on urban renewal. Or
the sublime view of the Statue of Liberty's back, seen through a
clutch of telephone poles on the flats of Hoboken, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition does include, of course, some images you may have
seen before: Lyndon B. Johnson taking the presidential oath of
office next to a shock-scarred Jacqueline Kennedy, or President
Richard Nixon's 1970 meeting with Elvis Presley. ``I wanted some
markers, to remind people of the time period,'' Bustard said. In
this fresh context, however, they are hardly cliche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure my collection could be absolutely
comprehensive,'' he said, ``but I hope this covers some of the
major events of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Picturing the Century'' is a small, simply presented
exhibition. It possesses the energy of an anthem or a march,
though, a tune that reminds a nation who it is, and what's defined
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picturing the Century: One Hundred Years of Photography from
the National Archives'' continues to July 4, 2001 at the National
Archives Building, Constitution Avenue at 7th Street NW,
Washington, D.C. Open every day except December 25. Hours: April 1
to Labor Day, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sept. to March 31, 10 a.m. to 5:30
p.m.

GAYS STRUGGLE FOR PLACE IN ORTHODOX COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By SARAH DOUGHERTY  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michelle, a 30-year-old office worker, has been
disowned by her parents. When she saw them a year ago, at her
grandparents' anniversary, it was the first time she had seen her
parents in seven years, even though they live in the same city. She
is forbidden from speaking to her youngest sibling, now 12. Her
older sister is one of her only connections to her family.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle is a lesbian. She is also a Hasidic Jew. Hasidism is
one of the most traditional branches of Orthodox Judaism _ and in
the eyes of Michelle's family and community, there is no room for
being both Hasidic and homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle, who asked that her full name not be used, has had few
people to turn to. She tried joining a more liberal synagogue, but
did not feel at home. And she felt rabbis were not properly
educated to deal with her problems.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has found some solace with a support group for Orthodox
women who are lesbian, bisexual or transgender. About 20 women
ranging from 19 to 50 years old meet monthly, and with the help of
a facilitator discuss family difficulties, coming out, and finding
a partner who shares their traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups have been around for over a decade, in some cases,
in cities from Los Angeles to London to Tel Aviv, helping their
members _ both men and women _ reduce their sense of isolation and
reconcile their religious beliefs with their sexual orientation.
But now the message of such groups is beginning to find its way
into public dialogue. Some members of the Orthodox community have
come out in recent years, and struggles of Orthodox gays and
lesbians will be highlighted in the film ``Trembling Before G-d,''
by filmmaker Sandi DuBowski, due to be released next year.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemmas faced by those struggling with their sexual
orientation are compounded by the fact that the Orthodox life can
be all encompassing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religion really circumscribes your whole day from the time
you open your eyes in the morning to when you go to sleep,'' said
Shlomo Ashkinazy, facilitator for a men's group in New York City.
``There are prayer services, rituals to observe, certain foods you
can eat and dress you can wear.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Greenberg, an Orthodox rabbi who recently came out,
agrees. ``The Orthodox life is both oppressive, if you don't fit
well, and very sweet for those for whom its rhythms are natural,''
Greenberg said. ``The calendar, relationships, and expectations are
set out in advance and there's a dependability and meaningfulness
of life that is never questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, Greenberg was a rabbi at a synagogue, but would
not have been able to remain there if he had revealed his
homosexuality. He is now an educator and community developer at the
National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family's reaction has been, 'It's hard, but we love you,'''
Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg has given interviews to newspapers in the United
States and Israel and strongly believes that change will happen
only when sufficient numbers of people come out to family and
rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they see that these people are their children, their
friends, their students and nephews and nieces leading decent
lives, things may change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions differ on whether Orthodox Judaism will ever be
completely accepting of homosexuality. Although there is a range of
communities within Orthodoxy itself, with some being more
traditional than others, other movements, like Reform and
Reconstructionist Judaism, are much more accepting.
</P>
<P>
   The Reconstructionist movement, for example, voted in 1984 to
accept openly gay and lesbian students to its seminary and to
ordain them. It urges rabbis and congregations to be as inclusive
as possible, but leaves decisions on performing same-sex marriage
ceremonies up to individual rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Richard Hirsch, executive director of the
Reconstructionist Rabbinical Association in Philadelphia, believes
that there will be liberalization in the Orthodox movement in the
future. ``There are lots of prohibitions Orthodoxy has gotten
around in the past,'' he said. He cited the prohibition on burying
suicide victims in Jewish cemeteries with a Jewish ceremony as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, the prohibition on male homosexual acts may have been
based on the assumption that homosexuality was a choice,'' Hirsch
said. ``That is a receding assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   But some Orthodox rabbis do not believe that fundamental change
will occur _ in particular for the prohibition on male
homosexuality, which appears in the Torah. (The rule against
lesbianism appears in rabbinical writings.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Torah is God's revealed word to man,'' said Rabbi Steven
Dworken, executive vice president of the Rabbinical Council of
America, which represents about 11,000 mainstream Orthodox rabbis.
``So any new scientific knowledge about the nature of sexuality
will not change the prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we demonize the act and not the person,'' Dworken said.
``I don't know of any congregations that are not open to admitting
homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many gays and lesbians don't feel comfortable going to
their rabbis for support. Myriam K., the facilitator for the
support group that Michelle attends, said, ``The reaction of rabbis
varies. Often their public position and private responses varies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashkinazy agreed. ``Rabbis will often say, this is between us,''
he said. ``Not many want to go on the record'' _ which effectively
forces gays and lesbians to stay in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   But most Orthodox homosexuals look for approval closer to home.
``We always talk about the family issue in the group,'' Myriam
said. ``It's the issue that brings the most distress to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle is still trying to replace the family and community she
has lost. She focuses a lot of energy on developing a talent she
was never able to pursue in her family's home _ singing. It was
considered immodest for women to sing in front of men. She now
sings with two choral societies in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although Michelle claims that the pain of being cut off does not
hurt as much now, the look in her huge blue eyes seem to suggest
otherwise. ``Jews of all people should know what it's like to be
oppressed,'' she said.

THE QUEST FOR FAME: THE PATH FROM THE DOGHOUSE TO THE PENTHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ERIK LINDEN  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was their first trip to Manhattan. Like so many
young and aspiring actors, Reba and Sondra King were innocent and
starry-eyed, filled with dreams of hitting the big time. Their
acting careers might start with a dog food commercial or two, then
maybe Broadway or a debut on the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the behemoth skyscrapers and the yellow cabs
crawling like ants down 34th Street, the suburban damsels wrestled
their leashes and panted anxiously.
</P>
<P>
   Two rotweillers from Staten Island can feel a bit out of place
in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this wasn't the best idea,'' Heather King, 23, the proud
mother, said to her husband. ``This was your idea. They're not used
to this.''
</P>
<P>
   King and her husband, Kevin, and their two dogs ventured into
the city to attend a seminar called ``How to Make Your Pet a
Star.'' Taught by seasoned animal trainer Barbara Weir, the
one-time class shows people the tricks of the trade for launching
their pets into careers in advertisements, on stage and screen.
</P>
<P>
   While many pet owners think their animals are cut out for
stardom, getting a pet into the acting business is no walk through
the park. Becoming Eddie from the TV sitcom ``Frasier'' or Morris
from the Nine Lives cat-food commercials is a rare feat. More
often, pets from New York City land relatively anonymous jobs in
print advertisements, photographs on greeting cards, or in theater
and opera.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny room on 34th Street where the $40 seminar was held,
Reba and Sondra were the first to arrive; eventually, 16 other
owners and their pets trickled in. Two Jack Russell terriers, a
handful of poodles and a Bichon Frise arrived. Then a woman from
Queens named Maureen Kelley came in and unzipped a black duffel bag
with breathing vents. Out crawled Piper _ a 13-pound Turkish Angora
cat with style.
</P>
<P>
   Named after the pricey Champagne, Piper Heidsieck, the lone
feline sat patiently on Kelley's lap, while the drooling dogs faced
her down.
</P>
<P>
   Class began with the bad news. Weir, a tall, thin 66-year-old
who lives in New Jersey on a horse farm, told participants: ``Your
pets will not make you famous, nor will they make you rich.'' She
went on to say that, first and foremost, when considering the
acting business what every pet should be able to do is, well,
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   If a pet can't sit or stay in one place for five minutes, Weir
says, forget about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals are basically props,'' said Weir, who has been in the
animal training and agent business for 10 years. ``That means no
sniffing or socializing, and complete calm.'' Directors of
commercials, theater and film look for placid animals who obey
orders, she said. ``One growl and a director will throw you out and
get another dog.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir's animals have impressive resumes. Her two greyhounds
performed in ``Don Giovanni'' at the Metropolitan Opera, and her
mutt named Fancy appeared regularly on ``The Cosby Show'' in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Weir brought along a veteran performer and her master to the
seminar: Carolyn ``Cookie'' Baker and her Yorkshire terrier named
Tiger Lily. The miniature, sandy-colored terrier appeared recently
in the Lillian Vernon catalog, and on a Valentine's Day greeting
card in which she held a long-stemmed rose in her tiny jaws.
</P>
<P>
   Showing off her stuff, Tiger Lily rolled over on command, as
other participants looked with admiration. Baker then placed a pink
rubber bone in Tiger Lily's mouth and stepped back to the rear of
the room. The redheaded Baker then instructed the dog to ``drop
it,'' and obediently, she did.
</P>
<P>
   Baker says that she enjoys doing different acting jobs with
Tiger Lily, and more for the novelty than for the money. ``I've
been doing this for a while,'' Baker said. ``And I'm not rich
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Income from commercials or theater, Weir told her audience, is
usually around $150 per hour. But they can earn more if their
particular breed is in demand, or if a project lasts for several
days.
</P>
<P>
   Most pets that land parts in movies live in Hollywood. Their
owners usually have several dogs of the same breed who look
identical. ``Some of them have eight of the same dog,'' Weir said.
``It's their living, and it's their business.'' In the movie
``Beethoven,'' she said, directors used eight different Saint
Bernards on the set.
</P>
<P>
   The first step for getting into the business, Weir told
participants, is to have a pet obedience-trained. Then, shoot some
simple 5-x-7 photographs of the animal against a flat background.
And finally, send the photos to a talent agency such as All-Tame
Animals or Dawn Animal Agency, both based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   After Tiger Lily did her pink bone routine, Piper, the calm cat,
went to the head of the class and _ despite facing 16 dogs _
remained mellow. Piper sat on a tattered black chair and withstood
several growls and swipes from Reba and Sondra, the two
rotweillers.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Maureen Kelley said Piper has always been a looker. That's
why she brought him today. ``Everybody keeps telling me how cute he
is,'' Kelley said. ``I think he'll be happy if he can get some
work.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Reba and Sondra, the rotweillers won't be getting work
anytime soon. The two dogs left early with their owners after
Sondra lunged at Piper. ``I'm not sure it's for her,'' King said,
smiling. ``I don't think she really cares about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Piper, on the other hand, might have what it takes. Kelley said
she plans to shoot some glossy photos of Piper, send them to an
agency, and hope for the best. As Kelley zipped Piper back into the
breathable duffel, the two headed toward the Empire State Building
and into the New York night.

<P>
   Minot State University, a tiny school in the northwestern North
Dakota farm belt, has always looked north to fill its classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the school relied on students from Saskatchewan and
Manitoba to increase its enrollment. Canadians often made up 15
percent of the student body and gave a significant lift to the
school's bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But now the university of 3,150 is facing a population crisis.
Already facing a gradual decline in enrollment of American
students, Minot this past fall found only 281 Canadians, just 9
percent of its student body, enrolled at the school _ down from
602, or more than 15 percent, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   That drop in students, and the decline in revenue they bring to
the school, has forced Minot to cut faculty positions and some
courses, said Nancy Hall, Minot's registrar and dean of
institutional planning. For example, the school has essentially
shuttered its political science department, declining to replace
its sole instructor after he left the school, Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the bottom line is we brought in fewer tuition
dollars, so we had to reduce the budget,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   The culprit is the same one that has thinned Canadian enrollment
at colleges across the country: the Canadian dollar. At an average
of 65 cents to the U.S. dollar, the currency this year has been at
its weakest ever. As its value has fallen, paying U.S. tuition fees
and living expenses has grown more expensive for Canadians.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty and administrators around the country complain that the
decline in Canadian enrollment hits more than the bottom line. They
say it also affects the level of diversity in classes, and it
strips away some of the students many U.S. educators consider among
their best.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools are being forced to adapt. Some offer incentives,
such as lowered tuition rates to Canadians; others have stepped up
financial aid and recruiting. But for many colleges, locked into
tuition levels set by state boards, and unable to increase
scholarships, the options are few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless that exchange rate turns around,'' Hall said, ``we
could send four more recruiters up to Canada, and I don't think
we'd get more students.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada's presence in U.S. colleges is still strong. Only five
other countries, all in Asia, send more students to the United
States. Canada sent 22,051 students across the border to study this
fall, according to the Institute of International Education, a
non-profit research and advocacy organization for international
education exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that number is 4 percent lower than in the fall of 1997. And
the dip could be steeper than the figures show, said Peggy
Blumenthal, the institute's vice president of student services. The
institute records only the total number of Canadians enrolled in
education programs, not the number of new students. The drop in new
enrollments, she said, is likely higher than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the colleges noted by the institute for their sizable
Canadian populations now report falling numbers. The University of
North Dakota in Grand Forks has 100 fewer Canadians than it had
four years ago, bringing its current total to just over 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not as good a deal as we used to be,'' said Barry
Stinson, the university's director of international programs.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers at Calvin College, a Christian school in Grand
Rapids, Mich., mirror those at North Dakota: In 1992, the college's
292 Canadians formed 8 percent of the student body. Today, there
are just 212 Canadians, constituting over 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   This despite Calvin's long history of admitting Canadians, its
strong French department and its political science and history
courses tailored for Canadians. Tuition and board there total
nearly $18,000 per year, or nearly $28,000 Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   An education at the most expensive Canadian university,
including tuition and living expenses, costs Canadians about
$12,000 in Canadian dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Like many colleges, Calvin has also put in place some hefty
carrots to keep Canadians coming.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it has beefed up Canadian exchange grants _ worth
$2,000 a student _ to lessen the effect of the currency exchange,
and officials there say the grants will likely increase in value
next year. Calvin also supports more than two-thirds of its
Canadian students with financial aid; the average amount is $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne State University, near Detroit, has always relied on
Canadian students who come to the school, just a few minutes south
of Windsor, Ontario. Last June, the university lowered tuition fees
for Ontario residents to the same rate Michigan residents pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Windsor is so close that we should be providing
the same opportunity to them,'' said Tom Sees, Wayne State's
associate vice president of student affairs. More than 500
Canadians enrolled there this fall, up nearly 150 from the
preceding year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many colleges and universities do not depend so
strongly on Canadian enrollments as Minot State, and many more,
such as Wayne State, have managed to hold onto and even increase
their Canadian population in spite of the feeble Canadian dollar.
And some schools, such as hard-to-find chiropractic programs and
the Ivy League, are in such demand that affordability won't stop
students from coming.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Minot, the school's directors are in the midst of
considering whether to continue recruiting Canadians, or whether
their recruiting dollars would be better rewarded in the United
States. They say they might focus more on nearby states, such as
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, if that exchange rate turns around,'' said Nancy
Hall, the registrar, ``we would change our recruiting plan in a
minute.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jason Edmonds, a flower seller, begins his day at
3:30 each morning. Mother's Day is coming on May 9, and he wants to
be ready.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds, 29, works in a small room where the aroma of roses,
carnations and chrysanthemums guides buyers to one of the several
cut-flower wholesalers in midtown Manhattan, a group whose members
face cutthroat market conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds tells his Mexican employees how to handle the flowers
newly arrived from Europe and South America. The five hours leading
up to 8:30 a.m. are crucial, as floral designers and retailers will
have come and gone by then, their purchase orders _ if any _
filled.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, wholesalers on the block of 28th Street
between Fifth and Seventh Avenues, where Edmonds operates, not only
compete with ``delis,'' or small groceries, but also with growers,
retailers, and other flower-related businesses. Time, location and
transportation are also factors that determine economic success or
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesalers are being bypassed by chain supermarkets and small
Korean groceries, which buy as a group, directly from growers. The
market is ``decreasing in Manhattan because there's a non-literal
Korean mafia,'' said Edmonds, sales director of the New Concept
floral shop, referring to what he says is price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all agreed to have the same prices,'' Edmonds said. ``If
you look at the volume that they sell, that was all business that
we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Society of American
Florists say they have not heard of such a claim. But ``we don't
monitor the industry that closely,'' said Doyle Johnson, an
agricultural economist at the USDA.
</P>
<P>
   The competition in New York City is fierce, Edmonds said,
because ``there are fewer delis in other cities.'' In New York, he
said, ``you can find two delis in one block open 24 hours a day.
How can you compete with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Koukladas, a Greek retail florist who owns Flowers by Valli
on the Upper West Side said he faced the same competition from
delis, even though ``here we have a refrigerator while they have
them out in the heat. Now even newspaper stands sell flowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets are also competing with wholesalers buying the
stock in bulk directly from importers. ``Supermarkets are buying
bouquets straight from Miami,'' Edmonds said.
</P>
<P>
   Miami is the biggest entry point for flowers from Latin America,
receiving 95 percent of all the flowers brought from Colombia and
Ecuador, according to the Colombian Flower Council. Colombia is the
biggest cut-flower exporter, providing 64 percent of all the
flowers bought in the United States, and receiving $500 million a
year in revenue, the Colombian Flower Council said.
</P>
<P>
   With the development of telecommunications, such as the
Internet, large supermarket chains and retailers are finding it
easier, faster and sometimes cheaper to buy cut flowers directly
from growers. That eliminates the middle man, which ``is called
'Disintermediation,' '' said Philip Nowers, managing director of
the Colombian Flower Council in Miami. With Web sites and
advertising, growers ``feel they need fewer people'' to sell their
flowers to consumers. Nowers said wholesalers also avoid importers,
approaching the growers directly.
</P>
<P>
   But for other wholesalers near the New Concept shop, the biggest
problem affecting sales is the lack of space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stores are very small,'' said Rob Hountenbos, one of the
three owners of another wholesaler, Dutch Flower Line, also on 28th
Street. Retailers, customers and designers cannot easily come into
Manhattan to buy and carry away flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working in early-century buildings,'' Hountenbos said,
referring to the early 1900s. ``If you create a building where
people can go in and choose their flowers _ and with parking _ we
could grow far more.'' There is one parking lot between Fifth and
Seventh Avenues with a capacity for 45 cars, but there are about 40
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation also affects the market. Once Edmonds had to
deliver a flower shipment for a reception for President Bill
Clinton at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, but the flowers never arrived
from Holland because inspectors found bacteria in them. ``See,
Clinton has been affected by the flower business too,'' Edmonds
said.
</P>
<P>
   Refrigerated trucks carrying flowers at 34 degrees Fahrenheit,
to keep them from blooming prematurely, arrive in Manhattan at
sunrise. Edmonds says he buys about 400 boxes of flowers a week,
which is about 80,000 to 100,000 bunches. But, as many as 100 boxes
might be thrown away if the trade hits a low ``like right now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year has not been good for anyone who sells flowers because
of the timing of some holidays. The most important days for the
cut-flower market are Valentine's Day and Mother's Day. But if
Valentine's Day ``falls on a Sunday it is a tragedy,'' Edmonds
said. ``It's good for restaurants, bad for the flower industry.''
People prefer to dine on the weekends; if the holidays fall during
the week, then the fastest and easiest thing is to buy a bouquet of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's Day fell on a Sunday this year, and the New Concept
shop received its shipments of flowers late. Anticipating good
sales, they imported 150,000 ``stems'' of flowers from Ecuador and
Colombia. But the flowers did not begin selling until the end of
the week because ``Ecuadorean pilots went on strike, so everything
came late,'' Edmonds said.
</P>
<P>
   Mother's Day always falls on a Sunday, but Edmonds plans to buy
``probably a million stems'' for the occasion. ``It's now or
never,'' he said, to make up for the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be crazy,'' Edmonds said comparing the week with
that of Valentine's. ``Not everybody has a girlfriend but everybody
has a mother.''

CALL IT NETIQUETTE: E-MAIL INTRODUCES A NEW ERA OF ETIQUETTE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By HANNAH MITCHELL  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just another e-mail message. ``Hi, sweetie,
how are you?'' Audrey Le wrote the message to her kid sister and
sent it on its way. No problem.
</P>
<P>
   Except that she entered the wrong address. The e-mail went to
the male teacher's assistant in her economics class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you have the right address?'' he asked her gingerly the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said 'Oh, my God,' '' recalled the 20-year-old Columbia
University student, laughing and adding, ``It wasn't funny at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Electronic messaging makes communication easier than ever
before, but with its speed, affordability and accessibility come
downsides, sometimes major ones. Send the wrong message and a
friend can be permanently deleted from your address book. Send to
the wrong mailbox, and you could lose your job.
</P>
<P>
   Given these new hazards, someone has to outline the dos and
don'ts.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the etiquette experts, who have recently turned their
discriminating eyes to e-mail. These arbiters of good taste and
manners are warning of the dangers of sending the wrong message.
Even the queen of etiquette herself, Emily Post, posthumously
includes an e-mail section in her latest edition, written by her
daughter, Peggy Post. And entire Web sites are devoted to what's
commonly known as ``netiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Barbara Pachter, president of a New Jersey-based
business etiquette and communications company, added e-mail
etiquette to her traditional staples such as business dining and
letter writing. Companies pay for most of the seminars, though
Pachter has also advised civic clubs and taught for Rutgers
University's M.B.A. program.
</P>
<P>
   Pachter says the biggest mistake most people make is to treat
electronic messages like casual phone calls between old friends.
E-mail should be used with care, she says. ``It's a word document
and it will come back to haunt you'' is the recurring theme of
Pachter's e-mail sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, people laughed when I said that,'' she said. ``But
there are consequences to the quality of the writing. People print
them out and people circulate them. E-mail is not private. Your
company has access to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two executives at Salomon Smith Barney lost their jobs in 1998
for transmitting pornography electronically. At Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, two former employees who are black sued the company after
receiving racist jokes by e-mail. The case was dismissed in 1997.
The e-mail was sent from outside the office and circulated among a
few employees, who the employer disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   While e-mail is speedy, it can have long-term consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Sternberg has written her doctoral dissertation on
Internet misbehavior, from electronic crime like e-mail viruses, to
gaffes like Li's. People send electronic messages to the wrong
addresses all the time, said Sternberg, who recalled one example
that left someone in a shaky spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to put together a panel and was inviting
participants,'' said Sternberg, a doctoral degree candidate in
media ecology at New York University. ``Someone on the list, who
was more famous, wanted money to be on the panel.'' The panel
organizer obliged, but did not compensate the other panelists. He
received a thank-you e-mail from the celebrity, who mistakenly sent
it to the unpaid participants.
</P>
<P>
   Pachter advises that when sending an e-mail message to a
prospective employer or client, you should make sure your spelling
and grammar are perfect. E-mail is technically in memorandum form,
but senders should still include a salutation and ``sign'' their
name. If you don't know whether to call or e-mail, follow the other
person's lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they call you, chances are you should call them,'' Pachter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Common sense may still be the best guide. ``E-mail erupted so
quickly that the guidelines and how to handle it are still
evolving,'' Pachter said.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg agreed: ``We've only had e-mail for about 15 years,
for most people less than 10 years. It will take time, in the same
way it took us time to develop codes of conduct for the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the rules of the game are being disseminated through the
e-mail grapevine. Bruno Pelletier, a San Francisco jazz musician,
uses e-mail to send his clients invoices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks better than a hand-written note,'' said Pelletier,
39. ``It means you're established.'' But he is careful with his
newfound business device. ``I had friends that kind of showed me.
Apparently, you're not supposed to use all caps, because it looks
like you're shouting.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule on capital letters happens to be one of Pachter's eight
``ways to mind your electronic manners.'' The others are: don't
contribute to e-mail overload; keep messages short, one screen or
25 lines maximum; use short paragraphs, they are easier to read;
fill in subject lines to help the reader focus; limit each message
to one subject; proofread messages, and remember e-mail isn't
always private.
</P>
<P>
   Pachter also advises e-mailers never to send a message when they
are angry. ``It's too quick, too easy to push the button and it's
gone,'' she said. ``If you're writing a letter, at least you've got
to print it out, address the envelope and send it. And usually by
then you've come to your senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Bennett, a 28-year-old computer graphics artist, likes
communicating with pen pals by e-mail, but acknowledges it has its
shortcomings. She recalls one regrettable message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said something, not realizing this person doesn't know me,
and they took it the wrong way,'' said Bennett, smoking Marlboros
and sending e-mails at Internet Cafe in Greenwich Village. ``That's
kind of hard, too, going in and saying, 'I'm sorry.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Had she had the benefit of italicizing or underlining some of
her words, Bennett said, her dry humor might have been understood.
``It's hard to express actual emotion'' by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   The Emily Post etiquette guidebook addresses that lesson. ``The
fact that the recipient cannot see you and you cannot see him or
her imposes certain limitations,'' it reads. ``The recipient can't
hear the tone of your voice, so it is especially important not to
offend people.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Riffe, 34, manager of the Internet Cafe, says he has
never knowingly committed an e-mail etiquette blunder, but he has a
friend who has done so. ``They thought he had an attitude,'' he
said. ``Somebody can read anything into anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be that people are out of practice. Back
in the 1800s, for instance, Riffe said, people wrote many letters.
But these days, virtually everyone has given up the pen.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg said : ``There's probably a whole generation of people
who simply never did much letter writing. E-mail is bringing them
back to the written word. But I don't think people can assume that
e-mail is like written letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Pachter added, ``E-mail doesn't replace face-to-face
communication.''

   NEW YORK _ It's shortly after 10 p.m. on a clear April evening
as A.J. Calloway struts through Justin's, a popular lower Manhattan
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   His shoulder-length dreadlocks pulled back to show off his
chiseled features, Calloway stops to chat with a group of young
men, giving handshakes as he moves on to another group. With a
drink in hand, he looks as if he's unwinding from a long day's
work. Actually, his workday has just begun.
</P>
<P>
   His place of operation is in clubs such as this one, filled with
young, good-looking people, dancing and drinking the night away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody parties,'' said Calloway, a member of Black Diamonds
Entertainment, one of New York's most active event promotion teams.
``It's all about making sure everybody is having a great time. It's
not all fun and games, trying to throw parties in New York, but
somebody's got to do it, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, more and more young entrepreneurs think so. Black
Diamonds Entertainment and other events groups, like ProLinks Inc.,
Net2 and Partners in Soul, hold parties several nights throughout
the week at New York clubs like NV, the Metronome, Vivid, Cream and
Nell's, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway said he believed people spend a lot of energy figuring
out what to do after work or over the weekend. Wayne Shields,
one-fifth of ProLinks, agreed. Like Black Diamonds Entertainment,
ProLinks has been on the party scene since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York is a large town, but there's not many places to party
and network for professionals,'' said Shields, a senior investment
specialist at T.I.A. Kraft by day. ``I wanted to set the type of
ambiance and environment where you could meet your peers,
especially if you're a professional or corporate type.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Shields and Calloway said they went after a ``professional,
25 and older'' crowd. While making sure their clients have a good
time, the promoters say they are also concerned with matters such
as contracts with club owners, security and disc jockeys.
</P>
<P>
   But, for Calloway, there's one major downside to the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep deprivation,'' he laughed. ``You're up at events during
the day, booking venues, going after sponsors. Then, at night,
you're at the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shields, Calloway, a 1997 graduate of Howard University,
does not have a day job. Still, he and his partners are doing well
financially, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he wouldn't get specific about revenues. ``Let's just say
that we're making more than the average young doctor coming out of
school,'' he said. ``The money depends on the venue you choose and
the agreement you have with the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Some expenses Black Diamonds incurs come from providing
security, which Calloway said, can cost up to $700 a night. But
sponsors, such as FUBU Clothing, Johnnie Walker or Philip Morris
can offset this.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Black Diamonds, ProLinks is steering clear of the typical
club scene, opting to hold events at private lofts in the Flatiron
District that normally are used for magazine photo shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get tired of that club atmosphere or environment,''
said Shields, adding that his group pays up to $6,000 for eight
hours at a venue like Nancy's Loft at 20th Street and Fifth Avenue.
The only club ProLinks deals with is Vivid Bar and Lounge at
Madison Avenue and 31st Street. There, the group holds its ``First
Fridays After-Work Mixer'', which is an ``invitation-only'' event,
Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said the Internet has been a big help to the business.
Gone are the days where promoters are handing out fliers on street
corners. Sending e-mails messages, Shields said, is the best way to
assure a safe, fun party environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got 10,000 people on our e-mail list,'' Shields said.
``By sending out these e-mails, it maintains a certain quality of
people. Instead of putting up posters and having street teams,
you're able to be a little discerning as to who comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway agreed, adding that Black Diamonds' motto, ``We reserve
the right to be selective,'' is placed at the end of every
promotion that appears on Web sites like Socialstep.com, a popular
Internet destination where parties and other entertainment events
are listed.
</P>
<P>
   Calloway says holding a party at Justin's, which is owned by
rapper and record producer Sean ``Puffy'' Combs, is a great way to
draw people in.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know Puffy and other celebrities often frequent
Justin's, so they may come out with the hope that they might run
into someone,'' he said. ``We never guarantee it, but it almost
always happens that someone big comes through.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields doesn't see the logic in such advertisements because,
``Puffy and Jay-Z aren't going to announce what parties they go
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Anika Warren, a 27-year-old student at Columbia University's
Teachers College, said she chooses parties based on the promoter's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my girls and I are looking for a hot party and there are a
lot of things going on, we'll decide by what type of crowd we think
the promoters will attract,'' said Warren, who frequents Black
Diamond parties at Aubette and NV.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said this has been the trend for most of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The social scene has changed a lot. There was a time,
particularly in the Studio 54 days, when clubs were in,'' Shields
said, referring to a popular nightspot in the days of disco.
``Then, violence happened and clubs fell out of favor. That's when
promoters came into the picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Shields said promoters became as popular as the clubs
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, it was all about the venue, but as the '90s started,
it was who was throwing the party,'' Shields said. ``Clubs didn't
need promoters, but now, people follow the promoter.''

BEYOND ROLLERDOME: DANCING ON SKATES BRINGS PEOPLE TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ROSS FINLEY  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A short, balding man in a beige shirt and black
trousers skates with a troupe of twenty-somethings, all of them
swaying to a dance beat in synchronized steps. A young woman in
spandex shorts glides around the dreadlocked DJ, hop-stepping, then
twisting around to skate backwards, and twisting around again.
</P>
<P>
   The sun is shining in Central Park, and the regular dance
skating crowd _ all smoothness and cool energy _ is out doing its
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an oasis in a concrete jungle,'' said Aristides Ruiz, a
regular who keeps his inline skates moving while taking a breather.
``To me, this is one of the best social scenes in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene is the ``Dead Road'' between 66th and 72nd streets in
the park, where dance skaters show up each weekend sporting jogbras
and tight shorts or tie-dyed shirts or preppy pants. And as they
skate, they groove to the musical gamut: techno, hip-hop, funk and
salsa. Motion and music are mixed in a polyglot of cultures. Young
and old, dark and light-skinned _ all mingle to the beat-and-glide
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Looking good takes a lot of practice, though. ``It's tough _ I
always feel like I'm embarrassing myself,'' said Charlie Koven, 22,
on his second time in the dance-skate zone.
</P>
<P>
   While Koven attempted to boogie off by himself to the throbbing,
techno beat, others skated partners or bobbed and whirled in
synchronized groups. The eye-catching tableau, as usual, attracted
more than 100 appreciative onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is great is that all kinds of people are here,'' said
Delphine Bedson, a visitor from Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   She and her friend ogled Jose Arzola, 48, a Puerto Rico native
who has been roller skating here for 22 years. Arzola says he also
appreciates how skating seems to attract people of all ages and
ethnicities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody leaves their baggage outside the park,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only place I've noticed where black and white, Jew
and Muslim, gay and straight, all kinds of backgrounds, you know,
just get together,'' said Steve Kay, a professional dance skating
instructor. ``Wheels and the music are a common denominator to
which these people can bond.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Williams, president of the Central Park Dance Skaters
Association, said the dance skating scene appeals not only to
teen-agers but to doctors, accountants, Wall Street brokers _ even
a few police officers. But the best thing about it is, Williams
said, ``It allows people with no cash to boogie.''
</P>
<P>
   The association was formed after a tumultuous period in the
early 1990s when rowdy DJs battled with police and park officials
over how loud they could play their music.
</P>
<P>
   Lezly Ziering, one of the founders of the skating association,
met his wife, Robbin, on skates in the park. They were married in
1997 at the Roxy rollerskating rink _ on skates, of course. ``The
whole park was there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay also said that skating in Central Park changed his life. A
onetime Manhattan lawyer, Kay was practicing his moves one weekend
when an advertising crew spotted him and asked him to do a
commercial for Guess clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, Kay had become a full-time inline dance skating
teacher, and professional performer who has skated on Broadway and
in a soap opera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did this for pure enjoyment, not thinking that this would be
any kind of career move,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   Another skater who has turned his expertise into a career is
Roger Green, who is well-known in Central Park for his odd choice
in skates. He wears an inline skate on one foot and a traditional
roller skate on the other. He toured with Michael Jackson in 1987
and once opened a show for Stevie Wonder. Green said skating has
become a kind of religion for him. ``It's not just about skating
for me. It's another level now.''

SCHVITZING AT THE BATH HOUSE: A TRADITION CONTINUES 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By KEVIN ROTHSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The burly old Russian strapped himself with a bundle
of oak leaves and grunted in the eucalyptus-scented heat. Lesser
men can't take the pain for more than a few minutes, but this
Russian, who has more hair on his body than this head, motioned for
another ladle of the leaf-infused water to be thrown on the sauna
rocks. In seconds, brutally hot air covered him.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Bania, a Russian-style bath house in Brooklyn, where
$15 buys all the heat and steam you can stand. The oak-leaf
whipping costs extra, unless you do it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is one of the best gifts you can give to your
body,'' said Dimitri Lamdon, a native of the former Soviet republic
of Moldova, as he watched Russian music videos in the bath house
lounge. A few yards away, the burly Russian continued to bake,
silent save for a snort or two and an occasional heavy sigh.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian bath, or bania, is a centuries-old tradition
designed to warm the bones and relax the body. It cleans the pores
and, some say, sweats toxins out of the body. The tradition is
alive and well in New York City, thanks in part to a new wave of
immigrants from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Around the turn of the century, large numbers of Russians and
East Europeans immigrated to New York and brought the bania
tradition with them. The newcomers, many of them Jewish, called it
schvitzing, Yiddish for sweating.
</P>
<P>
   Besides offering a place to talk and argue, the baths served a
practical purpose. As in the old country, many couldn't afford an
apartment with a bath.
</P>
<P>
   The bath house in Brooklyn began, co-owner Craig Brasky said,
when Russian native Alona Kruglak approached him with the idea of
opening a bath for the newest wave of immigrants, who had come to
New York during the early 1990s. Brasky, who previously ran a
school bus company, agreed. The two opened Bania in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Russians are not the only people who like to schvitz. Alexia
Brue, 26, a Vermont native, visits a bath house on Manhattan's
Lower East Side about once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Brue, a marketing manager who lives in Manhattan, even tried a
platzka treatment, paying a professional to beat her body with the
leaf broom. Brue doesn't like the traditional drubbing of oak or
birch leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like you're a human being in a car wash,'' Brue said.
``It's definitely not as pleasant as getting a massage.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian bath sometimes starts with a dip in a heated pool. The
idea is to warm the body in preparation for what's to come.
</P>
<P>
   The two saunas and one steam room in Bania have three tiers of
benches. Each puts the bather in a different heat zone. The higher
the seat, the hotter the temperature. The so-called Russian Room in
one of the saunas heats to a sizzling 200 degrees. The wood-lined
sauna rooms each seat about 30 people. But, the heat can be more
intense than newcomers are used to. Water on the body dries so fast
it can give a chilling sensation, much the way rubbing alcohol
cools the skin as it evaporates. After the chill, the sweating
starts. Men and women share the facility in Brooklyn and wear
bathing suits. Brue prefers to visit the sauna on the Lower East
Side on ``women-only'' days.
</P>
<P>
   A platzka treatment, as the oak- or birch-leaf scrubbing is
known, is considered a way to further open the pores. At Bania, a
10-minute scrubbing costs $20. Customers can also select a broom
from a barrel of soapy water and give themselves or a friend a
platzka.
</P>
<P>
   After a good bit of schvitzing, a dip in the 58-degree cold pool
brings relief. The quick move from hot to cold makes the skin
tingle and brings the blood to the surface, sometimes producing a
sunburned look.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, patrons can relax at one of the poolside tables with
a glass of juice or vodka. If all the sweating has induced hunger,
Bania's restaurant offers a full Russian menu.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bernstein was a bath house aficionado when he moved to
Manhattan from Michigan in 1977. He's been going to the baths ever
since, frequenting an East Village bath house until about two years
ago, when he switched to Bania.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein used to schvitz daily, if only for 15 minutes. He
remembers seeing John Belushi, the former ``Saturday Night Live''
comedian infamous for his hard living, at the East Village bath,
sweating out the weekend's excesses. Now Bernstein goes about once
a week.
</P>
<P>
   The long hours in the heat have given him a deep appreciation
for the bath's relaxing qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the deepest sense of the word, tension is an impurity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein figures that a good schvitz also exposes him to
ancient air trapped inside the sauna rocks, which is released as
they crack in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a primal level, you're reconnecting with something that was
there millions and billions of years ago,'' he said. ``All you have
to do is sit there.''

ALL-NIGHT GYMS WORK OUT FOR MANY 
</HEADLINE>

 By LULADEY B. TADESSE  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Physical conditioning is for daytime. Night is for
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless one is a sanitation worker, theater manager, cop
or cab driver. For folks whose work may not fit a 9-to-5 pattern,
getting buffed can mean late hours and someone like Gil Flores.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who studies film in his off time, works in one of a
handful of gyms in the city open 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
The 30-year-old is the night manager at one, Crunch Fitness, an
international chain. Most of the city's more than 250 gyms operate
somewhere between the hours of 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., the peak times
for gyms-goers. But they miss potential customers seeking the
flexibility of an around-the-clock fitness facility.
</P>
<P>
   Flores says Crunch's night and day clients differ. ``The people
that come at night are more lively than the ones that come in the
morning,'' he said. ``In the morning, they don't want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to work out when the rest of the city sleeps can be
job-related. ``Twenty-four hours is a very important factor because
we have the airport, Rikers Island, police precincts and Yellow Cab
people,'' said Peter Sarkissian, managing owner of BQE gym in
Woodside, Queens, one of the largest and oldest 24-hour gyms in the
city. ``Our parking lot looks like a TLC lot after midnight,''
Sarkissian said, referring to the Taxi and Limousine Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Velasquez and his fiancee, Vivian Bargas, both 30,
joined BQE two weeks ago. ``I live down in Corona,'' Velasquez
said. ``She lives in Brooklyn. We got very different schedules at
work,'' but they want to exercise together. Both work at the
airport and their schedules can vary from month to month.
</P>
<P>
   But clientele is not always limited to those who have irregular
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Igor, who would not to give his last name, a manager at Hardcore
Muscle &AMP; Fitness in downtown Manhattan, says some of his clients
like the quietness of the gym at night. About 75 percent of his
clients are men, mostly ``serious body builders,'' who prefer a
less crowded environment that allows them to concentrate.
</P>
<P>
   Crunch's Flores said: ``The people that come at night, they put
more in their workout, they have more enthusiasm. They are a lot
faster, more energetic on the machines than the morning ones.'' He
said he could not explain it, but guessed that they were coming
from work and were more focused on getting a good workout before
going home to crash.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason more gyms are not open all the time is
financial. ``The 24-hour upkeep becomes a big problem because there
is no down time for this equipment,'' said Sarkissian, who also
owns two other gyms, in Harlem and the Bronx, neither of which is
open 24 hours. ``You don't want to have yellow ribbons on your
equipment, he said, referring to indicators that the machinery is
out of order. BQE's biggest expense is payroll for its 40 to 50
employees. Utilities, which ``go up to $2 million a year,'' and
insurance are its next highest expenditures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay competitive you have to diversify,'' he said. ``We
have to offer more than any gym is offering. Our biggest thing is
our price. You have two years for $149 a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Convenience is at the heart of most people's choice of a gym.
With that in mind, BQE has a free parking lot, a juice bar, a
restaurant, a pro shop, separate kids' and ladies' gyms, daycare
and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of gyms better than this but this is open 24
hours,'' said Ali Bazzi, 24, a three-year member of BQE. Bazzi, who
is about 6 feet tall with crisply defined muscles, said he works
out every day. A salesman in Connecticut who commutes from his home
in Inwood, Queens, Bazzi goes to the gym whenever his unpredictable
schedule permits.
</P>
<P>
   The main competition to BQE are smaller ``localized,''
neighborhood gyms in Queens that are also open 24 hours, Sarkissian
said. Cynthia, who would not give her last name, is the manager of
Platinum, a small 24-hour gym in Rego Park. Platinum, which looks
much like the neighborhood stores lining Queens Boulevard, offers
many of the same perks as BQE, including a juice bar, parking lot,
babysitting facilities and exercise classes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Igor, who now is daytime manager at Hardcore, having a gym
that was open at night was good for his health in more ways than
one. ``I was on dialysis,'' he said. ``I needed to go to the
hospital practically every second day.'' He said he no longer needs
dialysis and can now work when he pleases.
</P>
<P>
   Although Crunch's all-night policy allows Flores to spend his
days studying film, working the graveyard shift can take a personal
toll. ``I don't have any relationships at all. Period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His weekends are devoted to making short films. ``Even on the
two days I have, I don't go out,'' Flores said. ``It has to be that
way.''

 &HT;    Expect education board with more edge
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes has been taking his sweet time making
a slew of major board appointments he's had on the table since the
end of the legislative session, submitting his applicants to
thorough background checks and trying the patience of various
interest groups, as he laps the state signing all the laws he got
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Given the general anticipation this has created, it was a little
curious that when Barnes announced his appointments for eight of
the 11 state Board of Education seats, he did so by fax and not
with a photo-op press conference.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, though: With the governor moving education to the top
of his priority list for the next year, the board members should
have plenty of time under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   The new board is likely to have more edge than its predecessor,
which was chaired by newly elected U.S. Rep. Johnny Isakson and
tailor-made to get along with the state's Republican school
superintendent, Linda Schrenko.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be interpreted as a shot across anybody's bow if a
governor in another state nominated a PTA official from his home
county to the school board, but after Schrenko's differences with
the group, the appointment of state PTA president Cathy Henson sent
a message that this board will have its own voice. No one who saw
another appointee, Gloria Bromell-Tinubu, debate winner Bill
Campbell and Marvin Arrington in the last mayoral race will expect
her to be a shrinking violet, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's a more Democratic board, but the strongest characteristic
seems to be a strong identification with public schools. Atlanta
lawyer Harry Bruce Jackson, for instance, spoke of his father, who
was on the Coweta School Board, and his daughter, a first-grader in
DeKalb County. ``I'm a product of public schools, and so is my
wife,'' he said, echoing a sentiment expressed by several new
members.
</P>
<P>
   And they are ambitious: ``We really need to beginning planning
for 50 or 100 years hence,'' Bromell-Tinubu said.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the edge may simply come from the urgency of the
education issues facing the state, more than the personalities of
the board members.
</P>
<P>
   Marietta, Ga. publisher Otis Brumby, suggested by Barnes to
chair the board, spoke of his concern over the growing number of
parents in his area taking their children out of the public school
system. One of the major reasons, he noted, was classroom
discipline, an issue Barnes has highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for choice, but public schools do need to be aware
they are going to have competition,'' Brumby said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what the board deals with in the next few years will
depend on the education reform commission, to be made up of five
members each from the House and Senate and anyone else Barnes
chooses to name, which will meet for a year to study new public
school policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the key to the future of education in Georgia is going
to be in the results of the commission,'' said Rep. Jeannette
Jamieson, chair of the House Education Committee. ``If we just
rubber-stamp recommendations, we'll get nowhere. But I do not
expect this to be a rubber-stamp governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes hasn't announced his appointments to that commission,
either, but he'll have to hurry. By law, it holds its first meeting
June 7.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: A school where we were loved
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Mae Hardman
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   One by one each morning the neighborhood kids joined the brigade
traipsing off to our Porterdale School in that Georgia mill town.
</P>
<P>
   Doris usually hid her sweater behind a tree and retrieved it on
her way home.
</P>
<P>
   Emily usually came home without hers, having left it wherever
she took it off.
</P>
<P>
   I hated galoshes and vowed I'd never wear them again. I haven't!
</P>
<P>
   At morning recess, some paid 3 cents a day for a half pint of
rich, whole milk and a sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   Because our mother made us eat a good breakfast, my brother
James and I never had that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   However, there were days when our peanut butter or egg salad
sandwiches got mighty soggy stuffed in our desks until lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Our teaches loved us and believed in us. We respected and loved
them also.
</P>
<P>
   I can remember something important from first through 11th
grades.
</P>
<P>
   Begonias, geraniums and-or sultanas always beautified the window
shelves of our classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   I can still smell the oil of cloves in Miss Jordan's gallon of
homemade paste.
</P>
<P>
   I learned scores of Bible verses in Miss Stanley's fifth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Our eighth-grade teacher, Miss Kite, chose a starlit night on a
ball field to teach the constellations to our biology class.
</P>
<P>
   I never ceased to hate maypole dances and physical education.
</P>
<P>
   I liked spelling and good grades.
</P>
<P>
   We grew. Our class graduated in 1942. Most of the boys went to
protect our heritage in the South Pacific, North Africa, Europe and
India during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I kept in touch with almost every classmate.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, we were grown before we realized that people thought
``cotton mill village children'' were different. Actually, we had
more opportunities _ in clubs, sports, churches, school band, plays
and the library.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when the time arrived for me to sell the family home
we had occupied for 70 years, I sorted out treasures for the three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing I did was kneel to thank God for all the
memories, and then walked out the door, locked it and gave the keys
to the new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Bone-weary, I went immediately to spend the night at a friend's
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   When I turned back the gold chenille spread, there were purple
sheets _ my school colors.
</P>
<P>
   That had to be God's way of telling me I had begun a new phase
of my life.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Because he's there
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Leigh Mallory was in fairly good shape, considering, when
they found him a few days ago sealed in ice to the face of Mount
Everest since 1924. Mallory left behind two of the century's
enduring mysteries: whether he and his young companion, Andrew
Irvine, had reached the top and why people do things like that in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mallory had a flip answer. Because, he said, it is there. Had he
survived, Mallory might have regretted coining the cliche, the way
Maurice Ravel came to regret writing the Bolero. Mallory was still
pluckily clinging to the rock face, dispatches from Everest
indicate, trying to arrest his fall. Irvine has not yet been found.
</P>
<P>
   One mystery has been solved. Mallory and Irvine were apparently
descending when they fell. Whether they reached the summit is not
known. Mallory and Irvine were last seen headed for the top, when
they were lost in a cloud.
</P>
<P>
   There is still no answer to the question of why humans do such
things, no answer even as to why they look for bodies at 27,000
feet. I once knew, but I forgot.

 &HT;    Walk tall and carry a loud tune
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Each spring I seriously consider moving. Not
that I don't love my old home _ I do, but budding tulips and
unfolding maple leaves mean just one thing to me _ it's time to go
into the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Once a year I screw up my courage to go through the door inside
my office closet _ the one that leads to the attic stairs _ but
before I ever open it, the psyching up begins. First, I picture
myself brave, tall, virtually fearless, and then, just in case that
doesn't work, I begin singing a loud song like, ``CALEDONIA! What
makes your big head so hard?'' That way, whatever unknown,
unrecognizable, and yet unnamed presence might be up there waiting
to pounce, will hear me coming and get out while the getting's
good.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hard-line attic hater. Attics are
really good things to have _ and the bigger the better because
everybody needs a place to shove stuff that's just too ugly to live
downstairs with the family but impossible to throw out because your
mother-in-law gave it to you and you'll need it for her next visit.
Without an attic, where would we keep the seascape Aunt Sookie
painted from memory right after Uncle Bert ran off with the lady
from the Western Union office? And where else could we store our
40-year collections of National Geographics and unfinished pieces
of needlework?
</P>
<P>
   Attics also come in handy during hard rains when the roof starts
leaking and we need a place to put buckets so the drips don't come
through the bedroom ceilings. Attics can be a veritable treasure
trove, holding everything from two empty 40-gallon tanks left there
by college-age sons who changed apartments so often their tropical
fish were in an ongoing state of shock, to hand-painted cribs
carefully covered and stored in anticipation of the first
grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with my attic is that I don't go up there
enough. I put it off for a variety of totally logical reasons (too
hot, too cold, too dark, too Tuesday) and so by the time I drag the
old Mighty Mite up for a spring vacuum, there's no telling what
might be there waiting for me.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a kid, the attic in our old house filled me with
mixed emotions. In the daylight it was a place to search for musty
treasures, but after dark it became an imagined chamber of horrors
to be avoided at all costs.
</P>
<P>
   On rainy afternoons, or when my best playmates and I were out of
sorts with one another, I'd slip into the attic to explore. One day
I found my mother's wedding dress in the bottom of an old cedar
chest _ a discovery that led to many enchanted hours of
make-believe.
</P>
<P>
   When the weather was right, and nothing was shaking outside, I'd
head for the attic to play ``wedding.'' Gingerly, I'd slip the
age-spotted satin gown over my playclothes and carefully situate
the ring of orange blossoms that held the veil atop my straggly
hair. Humming the ``Bridal Chorus'' from Lohengrin, I'd begin a
slow march the length of the attic to a dusty mirror propped near a
front window. The dress sagged and the veil soon turned tacky from
one too many snags on the rough floorboards of my ``bridal aisle,''
but enthusiasm for the game never dimmed. Until it began to get
dark.
</P>
<P>
   Come nightfall, I gave the attic door in the upstairs hall wide
berth, and after Tootie told me there was an escaped prisoner of
war hiding out in old Mrs. Collister's attic across the street, I
began carefully locking ours and taking the key to bed with me _
just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I'm all grown up, none of this kid stuff bothers me
anymore. I'm just waiting for a sunny day when the temperature's
right, to head up those stairs and clean that attic. Here I come,
attic. Ready or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``CALEDONIA! CALEDONIA! WHAT MAKES YOUR BIG HEAD SO HARD?''

 &HT;    Life in the aftermath of Florida wildfires
 &HT;    By Teresa Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Les Rarrieck no longer sprinkles raw
peanuts in his staghorn fern to summon hungry squirrels and owls,
and June Holcomb will not soon enjoy her grandson's aerial
acrobatics on the backyard trampoline.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Newland has stopped tending the 70 varieties of
tropical fruits and vegetables from his South American homeland,
and Martha Brann's flowering shrubs have lost their fragrant
blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four weeks after a most unwelcome visitor arrived, a dead
calm remains settled over Franklin Street.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial wildfires that thrust Port St. Lucie into national
headlines last month pounded Franklin Street, reducing five homes
to molten rubble and damaging two others before forestry crews cut
a 20-foot swath in the woods and ended the inferno's easterly
rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Acres of pine- and palmetto-studded forests turned to kindling
as the blaze, whipped by 30-mph winds, blackened more than 700
acres between Florida's Turnpike and Interstate 95 and caused some
$4.5 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Although at least 42 homes were destroyed citywide, few streets
were hit as hard as Franklin _ a once-bustling verdant corridor now
flecked with barren cement slabs, denuded forests and Dumpsters
filled with broken bits of lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen Kosovo, but I can imagine what the place looks
like after this,'' said David Keirs, whose large home on Franklin
was one of nine spared. ``We built here because of the lush trees
and the wildlife. Now I hate to open the blinds in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   The superheated flames turned Keirs' surroundings into a winter
landscape, tall ashen stubs surrounded by blackened clusters of saw
palmetto whose curling fingers resemble Medusa's writhing hair.
</P>
<P>
   Green leaves on oaks and maples turned to a crackly brown, and
from a distance Franklin Street looks like a Virginia neighborhood
in the height of autumn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs of green rebirth among the slash pines and
palmettoes, the firestorm changed Franklin Street's landscape
forever. Two of the five homes destroyed will not be rebuilt, and
owners of two others say it's unlikely they'll return.
</P>
<P>
   The daily pain of remembering April 15 would be too sharp,
Rarrieck says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't usually cry, but I've been crying a lot lately,'' says
Rarrieck, 50, an American Legion baseball coach and owner of a
sprinkler business. ``I saw a lot of Napalm dropped in Vietnam _
they called our unit the walking dead _ and that's what my
neighborhood looks like now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I could go back there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 7 a.m. on tax day, and Rarrieck savored his morning
coffee and newspaper a little longer than usual. Within an hour,
workers would arrive to install cream-colored carpeting and vinyl
tile throughout the house, and a year's preparation for Rarrieck's
new bride would be complete.
</P>
<P>
   Four houses away, Brann was making a list of building materials
she'd need to have a carport built for her lawn tractor. For no
particular reason, the 59-year-old Brann baked a 10-pound turkey
that had been in her freezer for months, and she later drove to
Home Depot for shingles and plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the quarter-mile street in southwest Port St.
Lucie, residents were having breakfast or checking e-mail or
heading to work.
</P>
<P>
   It would be eight hours until the monster made its house calls.
</P>
<P>
   Rarrieck left work early that day, eager to get home and see his
new floors. He'd spent a year replacing appliances and remodeling
the wood-frame home he bought on S.W. Franklin 18 years ago, and
Rarrieck wondered how his bride-to-be would like the changes.
</P>
<P>
   She never got a chance to decide.
</P>
<P>
   It was 4:30 p.m. when he got past the roadblocks, and Rarrieck's
neighbors were outside their homes in the wrenching heat, stuffing
valuables into the trunks of cars and praying for a wind change as
an 80-foot wall of flames careened in their direction.
</P>
<P>
   Retiree Keirs and nurse Newland, who worked the midnight shift
at Lawnwood Regional Medical Center Thursday night, were still
asleep when the madness erupted. Others, like Rarrieck and Brann,
arrived home in time to see the approaching firestorm but do little
else.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after arriving with her lumber and shingles, Brann spied
flames snaking up her to shed and ran inside the house to grab some
important papers, jewelry and a substantial amount of cash she had
locked in a fireproof safe in her bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   She emptied the safe and made it to her pickup with one armload
of papers before being ordered to evacuate. Her jewelry and cash
lay on the bed, outside the protective walls of the fireproof safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had left it inside I'd still have it today,'' Brann said
dismally, sitting inside the Holiday Inn suite that has been her
home since the fire. When she combed the ashes later looking for
any shard of memories, Brann found the safe; undamaged on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   A Red Cross worker found Brann's diamond-studded cross, a gift
from her son, now sooty and gray. All else was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rarrieck installed sprinkler systems for a living, he
was helpless in the face of the fires. Fearing firefighters could
be injured by falling electric lines, Florida Power &AMP; Light shut
off electricity to much of southwest Port St. Lucie. Private wells
_ powered by electric pumps _ were useless.
</P>
<P>
   He remembered his gas-powered generator in the shed beside his
pool. Maybe he still could stave off the fiery beast.
</P>
<P>
   When the generator would not crank, he discovered the awful
truth. He had no gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   With flames engulfing the house across the street and policemen
ordering him to leave, Rarrieck ran to his front door to retrieve
E.T., his cat of 13 years. When he threw open the door, he spied
his new carpet and tile for the first _ and last _ time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked beautiful,'' he recalls tearfully. ``We had just
repainted inside and out and bought all new appliances. It was like
a whole new house inside.'' Within 30 minutes, everything was
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   John Flaksa, who had rented his home on S.W. Franklin for five
years, was repairing a microwave in Jensen Beach when he got the
call over his Nextel radio: your neighborhood's in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Flaksa was thwarted by roadblocks at two intersections but
finally found an unguarded street. He drove past three burning
houses on Franklin before he reached his own smoldering ruins.
</P>
<P>
   Turned down for renter's insurance shortly after Hurricane
Andrew, Flaksa had no coverage. His sister reached his house in
time to grab some items, but couldn't remember where Flaksa hid his
house key. She saved nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last picture of my house I have is flames coming out of
the Whirlpool refrigerator,'' said Flaksa, who repairs Whirlpools
and other appliances. ``The only things I could save were a few
cast iron fry pans. They need to be re-seasoned now,'' he said with
a grim smile.
</P>
<P>
   When Flaksa arrived home about 7 p.m., firefighters were
spraying water on Edwin Scott's home across the street at.
Ironically, Scott was hoping his house would burn so he could use
the proceeds from a $75,000 insurance policy to move his family to
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it would have went, it would have been a blessing,'' said
Scott, who has been without water since the fire because the flames
baked his water pump. ``We'd have had plenty of gas money, and I
don't need pictures to remember what my kids looked like when they
were little.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Port St. Lucie's population of 82,005, the city's
beginnings are ill-rooted in a developer's greed. The now-bankrupt
General Development Corp. carved Port St. Lucie out of 80 square
miles of pine forest in 1961 but failed to provide municipal water
and sewer lines or fire hydrants to 80 percent of the lots.
</P>
<P>
   Although recent city councils have taken steps to extend
utilities citywide, the process has been slow given the city's size
and opposition from some property owners reluctant to pay per-lot
assessment fees of roughly $2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The 749 acres that burned April 15 holds 1,600 homes but nary a
fire hydrant. Homeowners who tried to use their own well water and
hoses were left high and dry because private well pumps operate on
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The direction of the wind, coupled with some houses' proximity
to woody lots heavy with pine needles, palmetto bushes and 50-foot
pines trees, combined to carve the fire's checkerboard path of
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Street residents witnessed three separate fires on
April 15, but the final one that blazed a northeasterly trail from
Gatlin and Rosser boulevards proved the most destructive.
</P>
<P>
   As dazed homeowners watched the orange flames creep closer to
their withered lawns, police and firefighters went door to door
giving residents two minutes to evacuate. Newland, whose house at
the corner of Franklin and California Boulevard was one of the last
to catch fire, was threatened with arrest when he tried to dart
inside his bedroom to grab photographs from his childhood in
Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour earlier, Newland had helped a neighbor save
his pool home from destruction when a smaller fire whipped through
another part of the parched landscape. The two men carried 5-gallon
of buckets of pool water to hot spots on the ground and roof but
Newland, a former firefighter in Guyana, had no pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire was just running as if someone was driving it,'' said
Newland, 49. ``When the fire was 20 feet from my house, a guy with
a tanker truck of water and hose were across the street and I said,
'Man, my house is going to catch fire,' so he came over to help,''
said Newland.
</P>
<P>
   The tanker truck ran out of water after five minutes but was
winning the battle and went across the street to refill with pool
water.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came back with a full tank, but then he got a call on his
radio and he was out of here,'' Newland said. ``He just vanished. I
never saw him again.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his three-bedroom home, Newland's family lost a
car, truck and 1 1/2 acres of South American fruit trees, vines and
vegetable plants he had cultivated for nine years using primitive
tools.
</P>
<P>
   Newland has vowed to rebuild. And this time, he'll make sure his
home is protected against the forces of nature that swept away a
lifetime of memories April 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going for wood this time,'' said Newland, noting that
four of the five Franklin homes destroyed were built of wood. ``I
watched my house burn for 45 minutes before I was forced to leave,
and I learned a lot of things. Nice cured wood burns like mad.''
</P>
<P>
   June Holcomb's house was the only concrete block house
destroyed, and its concrete and stucco walls remained intact, along
with some kitchen plates and a ceramic fish on the front porch
patio table.
</P>
<P>
   Items like those ``disintegrated'' next door in the house Flaksa
rented. Like most residents of Franklin Street, Flaksa worried
about hurricanes but never imagined a raging wildfire would consume
the treasures he's collected for 52 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of silver coins that my father started collecting
in 1921, and they just vaporized,'' said Flaksa, who found traces
of nickel and copper coins but no signs of the silver mint. ``All
the things you have turn into fuel for the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent divorcee, Brann had read newspaper accounts of the
county's desert-like drought and hired men to clear underbrush from
wooded lots surrounding her home.
</P>
<P>
   No amount of clearing could have saved Brann's house, she now
says soberly. The flames were too high, the wind too strong, the
trees too dry.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in her hotel suite, Brann admits she feels scared and
alone without the possessions that have served her since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the sentimental one in the family,'' says Brann, a
mother of three who displayed her family's heirlooms and
photographs prominently throughout her modest three-bedroom home.
``I had three of my mother's afghans that she crocheted and
whenever I looked at them they reminded me of Mama.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Port St. Lucie neighborhoods, Franklin Street folks
are friendly but not overly sociable, preferring to chat at the
mailbox or front doorstep before retreating into their own homes
and lives.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fire, neighbors have gone out of their way to comfort
one another. John Flaksa and Kelly Flinn lived three doors away
from one another for more than a year but never met until April 16,
when Flinn offered Flaksa whatever help he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Two children who often passed Newland laboring over his fields
of guava, passion fruits and gooseberry trees sat outside a Publix
supermarket one day and collected $200 for his family.
</P>
<P>
   A child who rode her bicycle past Brann's house walked up and
hugged the disabled custodian from Jensen Beach Elementary School
and asked if she was rebuilding the sky blue house that had been a
landmark on the corner of Franklin and John MacCormack Terrace for
13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't decided,'' came the answer, trembling. ``I don't
know where I'm going from here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here,'' as all of Port St. Lucie's fire victims will tell you,
is limbo, a sort of ethereal waiting room in between the dizzying
world of insurance claims, condolences and a final resting place to
call home.
</P>
<P>
   The community has reached out. A church collected $2,810 for
fire victims, and everybody from car dealers to Little League clubs
have collected money.
</P>
<P>
   And although fire victims have been offered everything from
rent-free homes to free furniture and food, most will tell you
they're simply eager to get their insurance check and rebuild or
move on.
</P>
<P>
   Most people with claims were given $5,000 for living expenses
within hours of the devastation, and a few were presented with
checks for the replacement value of their homes within a day or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Although nine homes on Franklin suffered little or no damages,
occupants of those did not escape unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was crying as we drove back into the neighborhood, past all
those burned houses, because I was sure we didn't have a home any
more,'' said Rose Bamonte, 79. ``When I saw our home still standing
I made the sign of the cross and said, 'Thank God.' Our
neighborhood looked like a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Keirs had the opposite experience. He was told by police
dispatchers that his home was engulfed in flames when he called to
check on it that night.
</P>
<P>
   When he, his wife and daughter drove down the scorched street a
day later, they passed a pile of debris and were astounded find
their spacious home on Franklin untouched.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pulled in the driveway and dropped to our knees,'' Keirs
said. ``It didn't have a mark on it.''
</P>
<P>
   For those less fortunate, Mother Nature's healing has just
begun.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drove down the road and saw someone sifting through the
ashes I had to turn away because it broke my heart,'' said Bamonte,
who evacuated her home along with her husband, 36-year-old daughter
and two cats. ``It seems so strange that the cute little house with
the front porch is not there any more. Everything is ashes.''

 &HT;    Report doesn't bode well for children born into poverty
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Amanda was destined to be a school statistic.
Another example of how child poverty shoves students to the back of
the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Her mom is poor, unemployed and has moved the 4-year-old to
different low-income apartments around Dayton, Ohio three times in
the last eight months. Only the efforts of Dayton City Schools Head
Start program kept the girl from falling completely out of the
system.
</P>
<P>
   But Amanda is one of the lucky children, according to a report
issued Monday by the Children's Defense Fund in Ohio. The report,
Helping Children Learn, says 40 percent of Ohio newborns start life
likely to live in poverty and perform in the lower half of their
class at school. The report shows a strong connection between
reducing child poverty and improving school performance for
students or future students.
</P>
<P>
   Like Amanda.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept finding her and bringing her back,'' Gail Rowe,
director of Dayton's Head Start program, said of Amanda. ``She
would have fallen through the cracks like so many young children
who live in high-poverty areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the new 4th grade proficiency test standards for reading,
the study showed that students in high-poverty districts failed
more often to meet reading standards. The report found that fewer
than half _ 47 percent _ of Ohio fourth graders tested last year
would have passed 1999's tougher reading standards.
</P>
<P>
   And in Dayton the scores would have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Only one in five Dayton students would have passed the 4th grade
reading test under the tougher standards. That ranked Dayton last
in the report among Ohio's ``big eight'' urban school districts,
which include Akron, Canton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus,
Toledo and Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons cited for lower tests scores in high-poverty
districts included poor children who:
</P>
<P>
   _ Move frequently
</P>
<P>
   _ Lacking regular nutritious food
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't have proper health care
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny's just not going to read as well if he attends two or
three different classrooms during one school year,'' said Mark
Real, director of the Children's Defense Fund. ``That's why helping
parents out of poverty can provide something as simple as the same
address _ and the same teacher _ for the school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With four in 10 newborns at risk, we must make sure that every
child is healthy and ready to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain risk factors at birth increase the odds of childhood
poverty and difficulties in school, according to the report. Those
risks include having:
</P>
<P>
   _ A mother who didn't finish high school.
</P>
<P>
   _ A mother who was a teen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Unmarried parents.
</P>
<P>
   About 17 percent of Ohio newborns start life with at least two
of these three risks, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   These problems plague kids all through their school years and
can set up a pattern for repetition, said Kathy Channell, a
sixth-grade teacher at Berry Middle School in Lebanon, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible for kids to break the pattern and not follow in
the footsteps of their parents,'' Channell said. ``If a child has a
good mentor, a parent, a grandparent who takes a strong interest in
them, they can overcome the risk factors.''
</P>
<P>
   Education experts say the report's findings are not new, but
expose the holes in the state's vastly different curriculums and
programs from district to district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohio has a totally non-aligned curriculum and everyone does
their own thing,'' said Tom Lasley, dean of the University of
Dayton's School of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mobility is a terrible problem in our schools,'' he said. ``A
kid who moves from one district to another doesn't get from a
teacher what they are missing at home and that's a major problem in
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the report's overall findings, some Ohio districts are
achieving better-than-expected school performance in high-poverty
areas.
</P>
<P>
   In East Ohio's Jefferson County, despite ranking 12th in state
for child poverty, nearly 60 percent of fourth-graders would have
passed the fourth-grade reading test under the tougher standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our community and schools have embraced the fact that we are a
very diverse district and have met the challenges of being a small
urban district,'' said Charles Joyce, superintendent of the
Steubenville City Schools in Jefferson County. ``Sixty percent
still isn't good enough, but you can longer use being a (poor)
district as an excuse to fail.''

 &HT;    Grandpappy Polluter: In 2001, he gets his 30-year pin for
dodging air laws
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Behold the bronze pillars of equality in the Texas
Legislature. The James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Act, which would add
penal severity for illegal acts aimed at classes of people, is
getting held up because critics say it would create a ``two-tiered,
unequal system of justice'' _ some crimes treated differently than
others. Can you feel the outrage?
</P>
<P>
   Texas lawmakers would never dispense preferential treatment to
anyone _ that is, anyone who is without a smokestack to his name.
If you have one, and if you planted it on the prairie before 1971,
we have a dirty deal: You'll be treated preferentially. Call it
compassionate conservatism for the elderly _ smokestacks, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Outrage, please. Or, maybe you think some pollution is more
equal than others.
</P>
<P>
   A tireless environmental band in Austin has placed facts before
the public that not even wholly owned subsidiaries of industry
(we're talking lawmakers) can deny. The loophole that allows
grandfathered plants to still evade the 1971 Texas Clean Air Act
must be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear that Texas is nosing up toward doing that with
all the fortitude of a house cat that can't stand getting its paws
wet.
</P>
<P>
   A bill before the Texas House this week is touted, too
generously, as a means of getting grandfathered polluters to clean
up their act. These are plants _ most notably utilities, refineries
and carbon-black plants _ that are operating outside of state law,
which requires newly permitted plants to have ``best available
control technology'' (BACT) to curb pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, grandfathered plants do have pollution-control devices
pursuant to less lenient federal requirements. Some have made major
improvements voluntarily. But as a group they're releasing roughly
50 percent more pollution than they should.
</P>
<P>
   Senate-passed S.B. 766, authorized by Sen. J.E. ``Buster'' Brown
(R-Lake City, Texas) and supported by Gov. Bush, would implement a
voluntary program under which grandfathered plants could install
cleaner-air technology.
</P>
<P>
   Implied in the legislation is that plants that didn't do so
might face requirements in 2001. ``Might'' is the key word there,
might as in maybe.
</P>
<P>
   What would happen if the plants didn't sign on to clean up? No
one knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest beef is that it doesn't say anything about (what
would happen) two years from now,'' said Ken Kramer of the Sierra
Club of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the bill is that plants signing on would
not need to meet current-day BACT requirements, like new plants do,
but those of standards roughly 10 years old. That would be a big
step, reducing pollution by up to 30 percent. But current standards
would cut their pollution by half.
</P>
<P>
   Polluters would be hedging their bets under this program. Do
they believe Texas legislators actually would come back in two
years and force their hands? Or don't they?
</P>
<P>
   Considering that grandfathered plants have won that wager for
almost 30 years now, why change their hand?
</P>
<P>
   Kramer remembers hearings back in the early 1980s during sunset
hearings for the Texas Air Control Board and the discussion over
what to do about grandfathered plants.
</P>
<P>
   The message then was, ``Don't do anything about these older
plants because they're nearing the end of their useful lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Now we're about to run out of '90s, and most of those
grandfathered plants are still chugging along.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown bill could be a big breakthrough if it really had
teeth in it, actually set a deadline. Then again, if it did it
wouldn't be voluntary, and it still would allow Texas to continue
to treat some polluters preferentially.
</P>
<P>
   That's unjust _ unless you own an old smokestack, or someone
with a smokestack owns you.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: What is hepatitis C?
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hepatitis C. Is this the disease that
should scare the middle-age bejesus out of Baby Boomers for their
dumb indiscretions 25 years ago? Or is it a medical panic attack
that will pass like a swine-flu scare?
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention kicked
off Hepatitis Awareness Month. Watch out, the CDC said: The
chronic, potentially deadly, liver disease infects 4 million of us,
and half don't even know they have it. The CDC is targeting two
audiences: People who had blood transfusions before 1992, and a
trickier group _ healthy, tax-paying, PTA-involved, soccer moms and
dads entrenched in the suburbs. Twenty or 30 years ago, they
flirted with peace and love and pass the needle while trying
cocaine, heroin or speed. And they may have gotten hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C can kill liver cells and cause scarring, called
cirrhosis. It is the leading reason for liver transplants. Last
year there were 4,100 transplants _ with twice that many people
waiting for a new liver.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as the nation's ever-cautious school nurse, the CDC has
labeled hepatitis C ``an emerging chronic disease of great public
health concern.''
</P>
<P>
   This month's Redbook magazine calls it ``the next deadly
epidemic.'' Last month's New York magazine wondered if it was ``the
new AIDS.'' TV's ER and L.A. Doctors have climbed aboard with
hepatitis C storylines.
</P>
<P>
   But how worried should Baby Boomers really be?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say hepatitis C is less an epidemic than ``an epidemic
of discovery,'' says Dr. Leonard B. Seeff of the National Health
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   People infected 20 or 30 years ago are now discovering they may
have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Disposable needles and blood screening for transfusions have cut
new cases of the C virus from 240,000 a year through the '80s to
less than 30,000 a year today _ but past undiscovered cases have
prompted the CDC's current push.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you say `epidemic,' the concern among the public is,
`Good Lord, around the corner there's a virus lurking, and I'm
going to get it.' That's not the case,'' says Seeff, the NIH's
senior scientist for hepatitis C research.
</P>
<P>
   But the disease is, he says, ``a major problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Visit Dr. Eugene Schiff, one of the nation's top liver doctors,
in his office at the University of Miami Medical School, and he
lays out the facts:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you the typical case of hepatitis C right now,''
says Schiff, director of UM's Center for Liver Diseases. ``Between
40 and 50, often mainstream America, very successful people. But go
back in time, back when they were 16 or 17, and that person shared
a needle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't get sick at the time, they didn't even think about
it. As they got older, they went on to college, many were blood
donors, wanted to help out the community. Good people. They were
carrying the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not until 1990 _ after some of these people had been giving
blood for many, many years _ did they go into the blood bank and
get a screening test. They were told, `You've got hepatitis C.'
They didn't realize it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how it turns out when you really talk to these people,
establish confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some CEO of a company isn't going to tell you he ever played
around with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In one painful way, the hepatitis C scare resembles the early
years of AIDs research _ so much hysteria, so few facts.
</P>
<P>
   What if you got a tattoo with a dirty needle? What if you got
your ears pierced 25 years ago? What if you had sex with a drug
user? Could these things cause hepatitis C?
</P>
<P>
   The answer to all those questions: Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a mystical virus,'' Seeff explains. ``This virus
is not breathed in, you don't swallow it. It has to get in through
a skin barrier or through some open cut. It's a question of being
exposed to infectious material.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is mystical is trying to define the actual, specific
methods of transfer. It has to be blood from A into blood from B.
The question is: How does that occur?''
</P>
<P>
   No one, so far, is 100 percent sure, but the major risks remain
needles and transfusions (before 1992) with tainted blood. There is
no data to show that piercings, tattoos or sex cause risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't recommend anyone who had a tattoo be tested,'' says
Dr. Joanna Buffington, CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it would be very, very, very unlikely that someone who got
their ears pierced by a gun in a mall got hepatitis from that,''
says Buffington.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC advises safe sex if one partner is infected until more
facts arrive. Only now is the CDC paying for a three-year study of
1,000 sex partners _ one infected, one not _ to see if sexual
transmission is a risk.
</P>
<P>
   And what about people who have the virus? Will they die from it?
Again, probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 4 million Americans estimated to have been infected, it's
estimated that 30,000 will die by 2010 because of liver disease
caused by chronic hepatitis C virus.
</P>
<P>
   That's 30,000 people out of a nation of 250 million.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 to 20 percent of people infected with hepatitis C, the
virus simply goes away. The other 80 to 85 percent develop chronic
hepatitis C, and it takes 20 years or more for 20 percent of them
to develop cirrhosis _ and then the big problems can begin. But
less than 5 percent of people who develop cirrhosis eventually need
a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the big picture, it isn't a huge number,'' says Buffington
at the CDC. ``Many, many more people are dying of lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   People with chronic hepatitis C have two choices if and when
their livers begin to act up: treatment or no treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Grasso, a 40-year-old Port St. Lucie, Fla. construction
worker, chose treatment _ even though it makes him feel sicker than
his hepatitis C ever did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always rundown and tired, like I always had a
hangover,'' says Grasso. ``I drank enough alcohol to ruin my liver.
I was used to hangovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Grasso, who quit drinking four years ago, had a liver biopsy.
His hepatitis C had not yet caused long-term liver damage, but his
liver was inflamed. He felt it was just a matter of time before he
got liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of whether you want to live or die,'' he says.
``I'm only 40, I have two children. I want to be around a little
longer. There is no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   His best option: A combination of two powerful drugs _
interferon and ribavirin _ taken for six months to a year. His best
odds: A 40-percent chance to rid his body of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, Grasso injects interferon under his skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost guaranteed the day after an injection I have
flu-like symptoms, a fever. It's all you can do to get through
work. It's bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Each day, he takes six pills, ribavirin. ``I get headaches,
insomnia. I can go three days without sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   To offset the side-effects, he takes: a pain pill twice daily, a
blood pressure pill and sleeping pill. He also takes a handful of
vitamins and herbal medicines that won't hurt him but might help.
</P>
<P>
   For the interferon and ribavirin, Grasso's HMO paid $1,831 for a
six-week supply. Depending on results, he'll need the drugs for
three months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the week, I'm pretty much out of it,'' says
Grasso. ``I don't want to get out of bed.''
</P>
<P>
   For a 40 percent shot at getting rid of the virus, Grasso must
endure months of suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Van Tuyl made a different choice.
</P>
<P>
   The 54-year-old Fort Lauderdale woman was infected with chronic
hepatitis C from a blood transfusion _ either after her serious car
accident in 1966 or several hip operations before 1990.
</P>
<P>
   She, like Grasso, burned up the Internet for hepatitis
information. She read about one of several new treatments being
tested, PEG-Intron A, that may work faster with fewer side-effects
than the two-drug combination that Grasso is taking. Eventually _
in 10 to 15 years _ there may be a vaccine, experts predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I nuts? Or do I wait a year for PEG or something better to
hit the market?'' she says. ``This is a slow-moving disease, so
maybe waiting a year is the thing to do. Plus, I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like the odds of success _ 10 to 40 percent _ with
interferon and ribavirin. And her neighbor, who unsuccessfully
tried interferon, has told her about the gruesome side-effects.
</P>
<P>
   Van Tuyl will wait.
</P>
<P>
   With the hepatitis C hysteria comes another similarity to the
dark days of AIDs _ shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with a tremendous stigma,'' says Thelma King
Thiel, CEO of the Hepatitis Foundation International, based in
Cedar Grove, N.J. ``People are losing their jobs, they're being
ostracized. With hepatitis C, there's such ignorance out there. We
have such a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   It's common for doctors to advise patients not to tell anyone
they're infected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to peel people off the ceiling all the time because of
all the negative stuff that's out there,'' says Thiel.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the controversy late last year was a drug maker's
Web site calling hepatitis C an epidemic. The Schering-Plough Corp.
featured pictures of ghastly jaundiced people with the message:
``To put it bluntly, every living, breathing human being can get
hepatitis C _ even you.''
</P>
<P>
   Schering-Plough is the maker of Intron A (interferon) and
Rebetol (ribavirin), the drugs used together _ at a cost of about
$300 a week _ to rid the body of the chronic C virus in some
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the American Liver Foundation came under fire for a
hepatitis warning billboard in Sacramento featuring a coffin with
the message: This space reserved for victims of hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   Overly dramatic _ and untrue, says Seeff of the NIH.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even without a vaccine and without good treatment,'' he says,
``most of the people infected are going to die from the diseases
most of us will die from _ heart disease, lung disease, alcohol,
trauma, gun shots and God-knows-what. Some of them will die of
liver disease _ but the figure is hard to define.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute of Health has just awarded a contract for
a wide-ranging, eight-year study of the hepatitis C virus and
answers to many questions will be forthcoming as the research moves
along.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there will be various opinions on what causes
hepatitis C _ and uncertainty may fuel more hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Says Seeff: ``In medicine, different opinions mean we just don't
know.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A on hepatitis C and other strains of the hepatitis virus
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHAT IS HEPATITIS C?
</P>
<P>
   It is a virus that causes inflammation of the liver. It is
transmitted through exposure to infected blood. Unlike hepatitis A
or B, there is no vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   WHY IS HEPATITIS C DANGEROUS?
</P>
<P>
   Many people infected with the virus may never know they have it.
The virus can take decades to show symptoms while killing liver
cells and causing scarring called cirrhosis in 20 percent of people
with chronic C virus. Cirrhosis can lead to liver cancer. Alcohol
speeds the damaging process. Hepatitis C is the most common reason
for liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   WHY IS HEPATITIS C SO HARD TO TREAT?
</P>
<P>
   There are six strains of the C virus. Genotype 1 is the most
common and toughest to treat. Each strain responds differently to
medicines _ meaning that the success rate for clearing the virus
from the body is 40 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER HEPATITIS VIRUSES
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis A
</P>
<P>
   Estimated 180,000 new infections annually. Vaccine exists.
</P>
<P>
   Transmission: Through feces-contaminated food or water or raw
shellfish harvested from waters containing raw sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms: Children usually show no symptoms and commonly pass it
to adults. Adults have dark urine and light-colored stool, fever,
yellow skin and eyes (jaundice), fatigue, nausea, vomiting,
abdominal pain. Symptoms disappear over a six- to 12-month period
and you become immune.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis B
</P>
<P>
   Estimated 200,000 new infections annually. Vaccine exists.
</P>
<P>
   Transmission: Through sex or shared drug needles. It is 100
times more infectious than AIDS. Can also be transmitted (though
much less common) by contaminated sharp instruments carrying
infected blood that are used for body piercing or tattooing, shared
razors, nail files, toothbrushes.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms: Loss of appetite, nausea, fatigue, muscle or joint
aches, mild fever. About a quarter of people may see dark
urine/light-colored stool, yellowing of skin and eyes. Some have no
symptoms. Less than 5 percent of cases are chronic.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 30,000 new infections annually. No vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   Transmission: Through shared drug needles/straws or other
exposure to sharp objects with contaminated blood. Also, blood
transfusions before 1992. Rarely transmitted sexually.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms: Same as hepatitis B. Symptoms can be dormant 20-years
plus and are frequently misdiagnosed as the flu or chronic fatigue
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Treatment: Estimated 80 percent of cases are chronic. Combining
two drugs _ interferon and ribavirin _ for six months to a year is
the most successful treatment available with a virus-killing
success rate of 40 percent or less. This combination of medicines
is expensive _ $300 a week _ and produces serious side effects
including flu-like symptoms, headaches, depression, irritability
and lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis D
</P>
<P>
   A co-virus with hepatitis B. Only people with B get D. Vaccine
for B prevents D. Symptoms and transmission same as B.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis E
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about this third-world virus.
</P>
<P>
   Transmission: Thought to be similar to A: fecal/oral route.
Associated with contaminated water.

<P>
   HEPATITIS B AND C FACTS
</P>
<P>
   A drop of HIV-infected blood can survive nine minutes outside
the body. Hepatitis B-infected blood, seven days. Hepatitis
C-infected blood, nine days.
</P>
<P>
   _ Each year, 9,000 to 10,000 doctors, nurses and other
health-care workers are infected with the B virus through contact
with contaminated blood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Of the estimated 4 million people infected with hepatitis C,
about 100,000 are being treated.
</P>
<P>
   _There are 4,100 liver transplants annually. Twice as many
people need a transplant, a number expected to triple in 20 years.
More than one-half of transplants are due to damage from long-term
C-virus infection. An estimated 300,000 people were infected with C
virus in the U.S. through blood transfusions before 1992.
</P>
<P>
   _Even a transplant won't rid you of C virus: It recurs in 100
percent of liver transplant recipients. Virus is present in the
body and attacks new liver. A transplant just buys time.
</P>
<P>
   _Increasingly popular herbal cures are not viewed by most
doctors as harmful but also not proven to help against the B or C
virus.
</P>
<P>
   _Scientists don't know why people infected with C virus before
age 40 move slower to cirrhosis than people infected after age 40
or why men move faster to cirrhosis than women. Due to homosexual
sex and homemade tattooing, B- and C-virus infection is estimated
at 50 percent in prisons. Home testing: The first at-home test for
hepatitis C was recently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration. Home Access Health Inc.'s Hepatitis C Check costs
under $70. For more information: www.homeaccess.com or call
1-888-888-4372.

Liver Foundation
</P>
<P>
   The liver is the largest glandular organ in the body, weighing
about 3 pounds and roughly the size of a football. It's called your
garbage disposal and guardian angel because trillions of liver
cells filter toxins and poisons that you eat, breathe or absorb
through your skin. Among the 5,000 jobs the liver does: Removes
bacteria from blood, stores energy, creates bile for food
digestion, creates muscle and is crucial to clotting.
</P>
<P>
   The liver doesn't warn of trouble until damage is advanced. When
active liver cells are killed and replaced by scar tissue, it's
called cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
   One liver can be cut in half for two transplants and within
three weeks it will regenerate and grow to full size in each
recipient.

 &HT;    Maternity fashions: Staying cool and looking cool
 &HT;    By Christi Mays
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Comfort. Comfort. Comfort.
</P>
<P>
   That one small word means the world to mothers-to-be when it
comes to surviving the warm-weather months of their pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comfort is first and foremost,'' said June Holloway, manager
of Maternity Works in Hillsboro, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Any natural fibers in fabrics, like cottons and linens, are
comfy. Synthetic materials like rayon and anything with stretchy
spandex keep the body cool in warmer months.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly woven sleeveless tops and shorts lead the way in this
year's casual lines, as well as anything denim, including the
popular overall shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Loose-hanging dresses made with spandex are great for an
expanding tummy, as are summery sundresses with drawstrings and
ties.
</P>
<P>
   Attractive, yet keeping with the comfort theme, sheer dresses
and flowing, rayon pantsuits are ideal for women who attend lots of
spring and summer functions or who want something a little dressy
for church or work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregnant women still want to feel in style and feminine,
because you feel like a circus tent is the only thing that would
really feel comfortable,'' said Linda Dizmon, sales manager for
women's apparel at Sears and mother of five. ``You feel so awful
when you waddle past the mirror. Pretty clothes help you feel
better about yourself when you're wondering, `What is happening to
my body?' Pregnant women who dress nicely feel better. It's
psychological.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only has the availability and variety of maternity clothes
increased over the last decade, they now follow the trends more
closely than in year's past.
</P>
<P>
   Women say feeling in style is important when it comes to picking
out maternity clothes. ``They don't want to stick out like sore
thumbs,'' said Lori Yearwood, senior merchandising assistant at JC
Penney's. ``They stick out already.''
</P>
<P>
   Black and white are colors of choice for many expecting moms,
since those are slimming colors. Navy blue is a hot color this
season, as are pink and anything with flowers on it _ from shirts
to sundresses. Shift dresses, shirt dresses and sleeveless dresses
coupled with crochet or spandex jackets are fashionable finds for
the mother-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   Rayon pantsuits and skirts with mix-and-match tops and bottoms
not only are comfy finds for the office, but also easier on the
pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of jumper-type things you can put a different top under
and then use the same top with shorts or pants,'' Dizmon said.
</P>
<P>
   With a little strategic planning, said Linda Thompson,
merchandising assistant in women's casual at JC Penney,
mothers-to-be can get by with a handful of essential pieces this
summer _ a pair of jeans, a pair of dressy pants, three or four
dressy blouses, several pairs of knit or denim shorts and maybe a
dress or two.
</P>
<P>
   Holloway urges women to splurge a little on at least one item as
a pick-me-up outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feeling good about yourself when you're pregnant makes all the
difference in the world,'' she said. ``They should always feel
beautiful about themselves.''

 &HT;    MONEYTALK: Calculator compares mutual fund expenses
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's give a cheer for the Securities and Exchange Commission:
It has put together a gadget that will help individual investors
estimate, fairly closely, how much it actually costs to invest in a
particular mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   That's no small thing. Most investors don't know that their
money pays the ongoing expenses of their mutual funds every year,
according to SEC research. It's a sure bet that most of us couldn't
say what percentage we pay each year, much less how many dollars
that comes to.
</P>
<P>
   Now we can find out, using an online calculator that makes it
possible to comparison shop in a very confusing area.
</P>
<P>
   To make it work, you type in the sales fees and annual expenses
of a particular mutual fund, the amount you have to invest, how
long you intend to leave it there and what return you expect to
make.
</P>
<P>
   The machine crunches those numbers and spits out a report of how
much it will cost and how much of your money will be left for you
at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost calculator takes some of the mystery out of mutual
funds,'' said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. ``And it lets investors
see how costs add up in dollars and cents over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The calculator is tucked into the SEC's Internet site at
www.sec.gov/mfcc/mfcc-int.htm. Many local libraries provide
Internet access for those who don't have it on a home or workplace
computer.
</P>
<P>
   You can't expect the calculator to make decisions for you.
Investors must consider many factors besides cost when they pick a
mutual fund. There are the basics of how much risk you can stand
and how long you can leave the money to grow. There are also
specifics, such as how long the fund manager has been around, what
kind of securities he buys, how well they have done and how well
the fund's goals match your own.
</P>
<P>
   But cost always matters. You can get fees and expenses from a
fund's prospectus, which is available to anyone who asks. The
prospectus also gives a standardized example of total costs, but it
is a low-ball figure based on a $1,000 investment and a 5 percent
annual return. With the SEC calculator, you can put in your own
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways to compare costs among mutual funds. The
chart illustrates a standardized comparison _ assuming that each
fund gives you the same total return each year. It shows, of
course, that high expenses will bludgeon your total return over a
period of years.
</P>
<P>
   An equally interesting comparison can be made by using actual
past returns of the funds you are studying. The Vanguard Index 500
fund has returned 18.8 percent over the last 10 years. If that
continues for the next 10 years and costs remain the same, your
$10,000 investment would grow to $54,977, after expenses of $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the Janus Twenty fund recorded an average annual return of
27.2 percent. At that rate _ if you're willing to assume it will
continue _ you would have $101,197. You would come out ahead, even
though your costs are nearly $9,700, or nearly 10 times higher than
the bite at Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   Which is better? That's an individual decision. The calculator
gives you valuable information, but it won't take you to a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   It has been drawing praise. The Investment Company Institute,
which is the largest trade association for mutual funds, calls it
``a useful tool'' for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Don Phillips, president of fund tracker Morningstar Inc., said
the calculator has the advantage of providing specific numbers for
individual situations. ``If you want to make fees hit home, they've
got to be personal,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Mark J. DiGiovanni, a certified financial planner in Snellville,
Ga., noted that the calculator totes up not just the direct costs
but the impact of diverting some of your dollars from investment to
expenses. ``It's not just the front-end fee; it's the money you
would have made if you had invested that fee,'' DiGiovanni said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people argue that the SEC could do a lot more to protect
investors. Maybe so. But the calculator itself is a step in the
right direction.

 &HT;    My night in ``Spin City''
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I'm cold. I-can't-feel-my-toes cold. It's 5:30 p.m. _
90 minutes before ``Spin City'' begins taping at Manhattan's
Chelsea Piers. I'm standing outside the studio doors with the rest
of tonight's gung-ho audience.
</P>
<P>
   One woman is slurping coffee. Another fur coat-clad lady sways
back and forth, as if that slight motion might warm her bones.
``Spin City's'' set is on the Hudson River. That means tundra-like
winds sting you in the face like invisible needles.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't care. I'm about to check out what's ultimately going
to be a raucous, Friday night taping of one of my favorite shows.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode, deputy mayor Mike (Michael J. Fox) offers to
help bumbling speech writer James (Alexander Chaplin) manage his
money. But Mike's stock market scheme backfires in hilarious ``Spin
City'' fashion. And since this episode will air during the
all-important May sweeps, there has to be a special guest star.
Enter talk show host Jon Stewart, who plays a smarmy stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, I look around. It's a mostly young crowd. I see a
lot of . . . pimples. Many of those young faces, I learn later, are
foreign exchange students from my alma mater, New York University.
There are students from Japan. Singapore. Russia.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be here for a while. ``Spin City'' is only a 30-minute
sitcom, but it'll take nearly five hours to tape. Translation: A
lot of long breaks and waiting around sandwiched between all the
yuks. Here are the more memorable moments:
</P>
<P>
   5:50 p.m.: The studio doors are finally opened. There's not much
relief inside, though. Those cursed air conditioners make it mighty
tough to thaw out.
</P>
<P>
   6:13 p.m.: I finally start to get sensation back in my hands and
toes. I'm relieved: New York City emergency rooms get pretty
crowded on Friday nights. Don't ask how I know this.
</P>
<P>
   6:20 p.m.: Patrick Preblick, ``Spin City's'' perky publicist,
stops over and gives me the 25-cent tour. I see real-life pictures
of Barry Bostwick, who plays dim-bulb Mayor Randall Winston, with
Gerald Ford. Mike's office is decorated with pictures of Napoleon,
former President Jimmy Carter and a New York Mets cap _ with an
upside down NY insignia! Since I'm the biggest Mets fans around, I
have to ask about (ital)that(end ital). ``That's funny,'' says
Preblick, chuckling. ``I'll have to ask someone about that.'' I bet
she never did.
</P>
<P>
   6:57 p.m.: For the people who have no idea what ``Spin City'''s
about, ABC shows a clip reel and brief interviews with the show's
stars.
</P>
<P>
   7:05 p.m.: Mike Royce, the show's warm-up comic, makes his
entrance. I like him immediately. He asks each foreign student to
stand up and tell the audience where they're from. A guy from
Denmark is one of the first to stand. He's big and has a deep
voice. Says Royce: ``You sound like the Danish Terminator and I'm
afraid of you.''
</P>
<P>
   7:25 p.m.: The cast is introduced. All of them run out like
college football players before a big bowl game. I must say, I'm
looking for the curvy Jennifer Esposito, who plays the curvy Stacy.
Afterward, Royce tells us what's going to happen next. ``The lights
are going to go down and we will all touch each other
inappropriately.'' I laugh hard _ and so does everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   7:32 p.m.: Mike, James, Carter (Michael Boatman) and Stu (Alan
Ruck) are playing poker at James' house. Boatman is the first to
flub a line. ``You suck,'' Fox yells to a smiling Boatman. ``He's
got guests in the audience. His mom is here, so there's no real
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   8:32 p.m.: ABC passes out raisins and water. What a gyp! We all
growl. ``Hey,'' shouts Royce, ``there's no finer raisin than the
Shop-Rite raisin. Eat them slow.''
</P>
<P>
   8:38 p.m.: In one of the show's funnier scenes, Stu checks out
the new Randall Winston action figure, a rather well-endowed doll.
Mayor Winston to girlfriend Janelle (Victoria Dillard): ``Are we
still on for tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   Janelle, after checking out the well-endowed doll: ``You better
believe it!''
</P>
<P>
   8:50 p.m.: The crowd is getting restless. Too many breaks
between scenes. Some audience members are getting creative with
those raisin boxes. ``Don't turn those raisin boxes into make-shift
harmonicas,'' Royce warns.
</P>
<P>
   9:01 p.m.: Tom Hertz, a ``Spin City'' writer, takes his turn
entertaining the crowd with jokes about marriage, breast implants
and sex. ``You know that smacking sound you hear during sex? I
pretend I'm getting applause.''
</P>
<P>
   9:12 p.m.: Royce has too much time on his hands, so he starts
bad-mouthing talk show host Maury Povich, his former employer.
``He's the crankiest host in the business,'' Royce sniffs. ``I
don't want to say anything bad about the networks, though, because
I want to work for one. If someone's out there from PAX TV, I'll
change religions.'' I'd call Bud Paxson, but I don't have a cell
phone.
</P>
<P>
   9:43 p.m.: It's getting late. Royce senses this, so he asks
people to come down to do impressions and goofy acts. This is New
York, so people are more than happy to oblige. One high school kid
does a creepy Mister Rogers bit. We keep an eye on him the rest of
the night.
</P>
<P>
   9:57 p.m.: Stewart makes his entrance and gets a loud ovation.
Two minutes later, Fox forgets Stewart's character's name.
</P>
<P>
   10:07 p.m.: More down time. The Gong Show-like acts continue.
One man does a ventriloquist bit. Another performs a mean Donald
Duck impression. ``I'm both frightened and enlightened,'' cracks
Royce.
</P>
<P>
   10:13 p.m.: It's attack New York time. Someone wants to know if
New York has ATMs in the subways. ``Yeah, we have cash machines in
New York subways,'' Royce says. ``They're called tourists.''
</P>
<P>
   10:30 p.m.: Everyone's messing up their lines now. ``You're
horrible, Richard,'' yells Richard Kind, who plays the mayor's
press secretary, at himself after a goof. ``I suck,'' screams
Dillard after her flub.
</P>
<P>
   10:37 p.m.: Fox joins the audience _ it's the night's high
point. ``Save me a box of those raisins!'' The weary crowd is
thrilled. They ask Fox about Back to the Future, Teen Wolf and
supermodel Heidi Klum. ``Yeah, Heidi's doing a two-part episode,''
he says. ``My wife cut her vacation short.''
</P>
<P>
   10:42 p.m.: Fox continues to work the room like a skilled
politician. The Canada native remembers his first U.S. job. It was
Midnight Madness, a film with David Naughton. ``He was the Dr.
Pepper guy. It was like the Beatles, man.'' Fox then tells the
crowd about the great job he's got. ``I mean, there are guys in

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ Dispatches from Dreamsville: One by one each

our Porterdale School in that Georgia mill town. Our teachers loved
us and believed in us. We respected and loved them also. (Hardman,

<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ George Leigh Mallory was in fairly good
shape, considering, when they found him a few days ago sealed in
ice to the face of Mount Everest since 1924. There is still no
answer to the question of why humans do such things, no answer even
as to why they look for bodies at 27,000 feet. I once knew, but I
forgot. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ When I was a kid, the attic
in our old house filled me with mixed emotions. In the daylight it
was a place to search for musty treasures, but after dark it became
an imagined chamber of horrors to be avoided at all costs. Don't
get me wrong, I'm not a hard-line attic hater. Attics are really
good things to have _ and the bigger the better because everybody
needs a place to shove stuff that's just too ugly to live
downstairs with the family but impossible to throw out because your
mother-in-law gave it to you and you'll need it for her next visit.
(Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ Texas lawmakers would never
dispense preferential treatment to anyone _ that is, anyone who is
without a smokestack to his name. If you have one, and if you
planted it on the prairie before 1971, you'll be treated
preferentially. Outrage, please. Or, maybe you think some pollution
is more equal than others. (Young, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   HEALTH-HEPATITIS-C _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Acting as the
nation's ever-cautious school nurse, the CDC has labeled hepatitis
C ``an emerging chronic disease of great public health concern.''
This month's Redbook magazine calls it ``the next deadly
epidemic.'' Last month's New York magazine wondered if it was ``the
new AIDS.'' TV's ER and L.A. Doctors have climbed aboard with
hepatitis C storylines. But how worried should Baby Boomers really
be? Experts say hepatitis C is less an epidemic than ``an epidemic
of discovery,'' says Dr. Leonard B. Seeff of the National Health
Institute. People infected 20 or 30 years ago are now discovering
they may have a problem. And, With the hepatitis C hysteria comes
another similarity to the dark days of AIDS _ shame. (Lomartire,

   MONEYTALK _ Let's give a cheer for the Securities and Exchange
Commission: It has put together a gadget that will help individual
investors estimate, fairly closely, how much it actually costs to
invest in a particular mutual fund. That's no small thing. Most
investors don't know that their money pays the ongoing expenses of
their mutual funds every year, according to SEC research. It's a
sure bet that most of us couldn't say what percentage we pay each
year, much less how many dollars that comes to. Now we can find
out, using an online calculator that makes it possible to
comparison shop in a very confusing area. (Ezell, Atlanta

   FUEL: More bad news for regional transportation planners who
pinned their hopes for improving Kansas City's air quality on
reformulated gasoline (RFG). First, it was revealed that RFG, when
it leaks, is a worse groundwater polluter than standard gasoline.

MRS. SHEPARD URGES CONGRESS TO PROTECT GAYS IN HATE CRIME LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Judy Shepard, urging Congress to expand the federal
hate crimes law to protect homosexuals from violence, speculated
Tuesday that her son Matthew may not have been killed outside
Laramie, Wyo., last year if there had been such a law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I would not have to be here today, talking about how my
son was savagely beaten, tied to a fence and left to die in
freezing temperatures,'' Shepard said. ``Matt is no longer with us
today because the men who killed him learned to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   She told the Senate Judiciary Committee how her son Matthew, who
was a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, was beaten
last October simply because he was gay. She urged the panel to
approve legislation that would broaden the federal hate crimes law
to protect gays.
</P>
<P>
   The current hate crimes law, which was passed in 1969, allows
the federal government to prosecute crimes against people based on
race, color, religion or national origin. The law also requires
that any victim must have been participating in at least one of six
``federally protected activities'' such as attending a public
school, serving as a juror or being present in a public space such
as a park.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators, including Sens. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., recently introduced legislation
that would expand the federal hate crimes law to include gender,
disability and sexual orientation. It would also eliminate the
federal protected activities language from the current law.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard said she realizes that a new law may not have prevented
Matthew's death, but ``perhaps these murders would have gotten the
message that this country does not tolerate hate-motivated
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   She told lawmakers that enactment of the law would be worth it
``if even one family can avoid getting that phone call in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Most hate crimes are prosecuted at the state and local level but
U.S. Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal hate
crimes statue allows the federal government to give state and local
officials assistance. Such assistance includes using the Federal

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-GLACIER &LR;  -- Our great-great-grandmothers waited
a lifetime for the social glacier to creak forward an inch. But
today a woman can wake up one morning and find that yesterday's
social reality has vanished overnight. 2,300 words. By Gail

   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-BABIES &LR;  -- Every day technology offers more

 &UR; MAPPING the MILLENNIUM: ``Interior Territory'' &LR;  &QC;

<P>
   Ranging from the 13th to the late 20th centuries, these images
of the interior of the female body display a century's advance in
technology. Yet in terms of truth, the recent digital cross-section
is as cold and inhuman and soulless as the medieval pre-dissection
diagram.

   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-TIMELINE &LR;  -- Written mostly by men, traditional
histories of the last 1,000 years all tend to sell women short.

Zemon Davis, a former history professor at Princeton University and
the author of ``The Return of Martin Guerre,'' and Jill Ker Conway,
a former Smith College president.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-FUTURE &LR;  -- Today's twenty- and thirtysomethings
were born after the ``bad old days.'' But without a historical
awareness, they are vulnerable to sliding back into that dreamy,
dependent state of Women's Time, when relying on cleavage and
astrology was a means to personal definition. 1,600 words. By Naomi
Wolf, author of ``The Beauty Myth'' and ``Promiscuities.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-SAINTS &LR;  -- To gain special favor and appeal in
the public eye, or to be regarded as a holy creature, why must a
woman be able to endure public humiliation, self-abuse, pain and
suffering? This is one thing that hasn't changed in a century.

 &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-LUST &LR;  -- From St. Thomas Aquinas' 13th-century
pronouncement, ``Woman is defective and misbegotten,'' to Shere
Hite's 1976 eye-opener, ``Men make their own orgasms during sex;
women should be able to as well,'' views on female sexuality, from
the heinous to the weird, have reflected each era's own morality,
science and religious thought. 1,300 words. Quotations selected by
Camille Sweeney, a project editor for The New York Times Magazine's
millennium issues.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-CHINA &LR;  -- In the old China, women had their
feet bound; they often had no first names and they killed
themselves when their husbands died. It was only in the last
century that the women's revolution came to China. 2,400 words. By
Sheryl WuDunn, a Tokyo-based correspondent for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-PROFILES &LR;  -- Sometimes a woman has to say
``no'' to make her mark. Here is a gallery of such troublemakers,
zealots and doers. They include Lady Godiva, Hildegard of Bingen,
Ida Tarbell, Margaret Thatcher and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. 13
profiles of about 200 words each. By authors including James Atlas,
Margo Jefferson, Phillip Lopate and Linda Nochlin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-ETIQUETTE &LR;  -- Betty Crocker, Fannie Farmer,
Martha Stewart: All our kindly, bossy advice-givers, real and
invented, trace their lineage to Mrs. Isabella Beeton, whose
``Beeton's Book of Household Management'' very properly instructed
ladies on when to pay the servants, what color lace to wear and how
to pick a breed of pig. 900 words. By novelist Margaret Atwood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-ART &LR;  -- Funny how men's pictures of women
differ from women's pictures of women. After centuries of
conforming to men's views and stereotypes, female artists are
taking control of their own images. 1,200 words. By Holland Cotter,
an art critic for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-LANGUAGE &LR;  -- Ought one utter the pithy
phrase,``but the era of every man for himself must never begin,''
and risk insulting all the women in the audience? Or ought one
change it to the murkier ``but we cannot go back to the time when
our citizens were left to fend for themselves,'' and hold the ears
of both genders? 1,000 words. By veteran New York Times columnist
William Safire.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-ECONOMICS &LR;  -- A panel of experts looks at

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-CYBERSPACE &LR;  -- It may take cyberspace, where a
string of words can arrive free of the sender's face or name or
gender, to create a climate in which men will listen when women
speak up. 1,100 words. By the Information Age guru, Esther Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-KIDS &LR;  -- Today's kids voice their views on
subjects such as women in charge; women acting like men; the
possibilties of a woman president and of men having babies. 2,700
words. Conversations gathered and edited by New York free-lance
writer Kim France.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BC-MILLENNIUM-WOMEN-LISTEN &LR;  -- In ``Beowulf,'' the 8th-century
Anglo-Saxon saga, the hero recounts his manly feats to win the love
of Wealhtheow, queen of Hrothgar, who is serving beer to a
gathering of men. Sound familiar? Walk through any restaurant today
and hear the chatter of boastful men striving to impress the
(silent) woman of the hour. 1,500 words. By linguistics professor
Deborah Tannen.

 By JAMES BANDLER  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    In New England, home to Smith &AMP; Wesson and Colt, firearms are
big business. But legal assaults and internal squabbles are
inflicting deep wounds on the industry.
 &HT;    The four-star Wigwam Resort outside Phoenix looks out over lush
golf courses and citrus groves to the Arizona desert and the purple
silhouettes of the White Tank Mountains beyond. But the firearms
industry executives who assembled there in February spent precious
little time admiring the scenery.
 &HT;    For the better part of two days, they sequestered themselves
inside a windowless conference room, emerging only to stretch their
legs and grab coffee and sandwiches. They had come on a survival
mission.
 &HT;    Just two weeks before, a New York jury had found that 15 handgun
makers had negligently marketed and distributed their weapons. The
suit was brought on behalf of shooting victims of urban violence.
 &HT;    The verdict sent a ripple of anxiety through the gun industry,
which, collectively, had never before been held legally responsible
for the negligent misuse of its products. And it emboldened
big-city mayors from around the country who were mounting their own
tobacco-style legal assault against firearms makers.
 &HT;    Now, the gun manufacturers were facing the specter of protracted
and expensive court battles that could bleed them dry. And the
stress was showing.
 &HT;    Robert Delfay, head of the Connecticut-based National Shooting
Sports Foundation and the host of the meeting, had been up since
2:30 a.m., preparing. ``I sleep like a baby,'' he recalled saying.
``I wake up every three hours crying.''
 &HT;    The group included some 30 top executives from around the
country, among them 10 from New England's influential ``Gun
Valley,'' the Connecticut River corridor of gun makers stretching
from New Hampshire to Long Island Sound. There were representatives
from O. F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons of North Haven, Conn.; Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co. Inc. of Southport, Conn.; Colt's Manufacturing Co. of Hartford;
and H &AMP; R 1871 Inc. of Gardner, Mass.
 &HT;    From Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp. of Springfield, Mass., the biggest
handgun manufacturer in the world, came Ed Shultz, a short and
plain-spoken pragmatist in an industry known for its ideologues.
 &HT;    Dismayed by the fractiousness that has plagued his industry for
years, Shultz studied his colleagues in the conference room,
wondering if they could mend their ways. From Shultz's perspective,
the last few months had not gone well. A legal-strategy meeting in
Tampa in November 1998 had ended with bruised egos and
door-slamming. The industry was riven by personality clashes, turf
battles, and the omnipresent conflicts between moderates and
hard-liners.
 &HT;    As the Phoenix meeting unfolded, the executives did their utmost
to present a unified front. The feuding trade groups were brought
together under the banner of a new organization, the Hunting and
Shooting Sports Heritage Foundation. To be funded by a voluntary
tax of 1 percent of member companies' annual sales, the new group
would coordinate the gun makers' legal and public-relations
counterattack.
 &HT;    One participant, James Garrison, CEO of H &AMP; R 1871 Inc., went so
far as to liken the gathering to the historic first session of the
United Nations in 1947. ``This is a revolutionary thing that
occurred,'' Garrison later recalled saying. ``For the first time, a
fractious industry has been unified. You have the whole industry
coming together.''
 &HT;    But some companies were already complaining that the new
Heritage Foundation board simply preserved the hegemony of old-line
manufacturers such as Colt, Remington, and Sturm, Ruger. Absent
from the board were the California makers of the so-called Saturday
night specials, inexpensive handguns associated with street crime.
Distributors and dealers also felt underrepresented.
 &HT;    And the new policy group had failed to quell disagreements over
strategy, including whether to support instant criminal background
checks of those purchasing firearms at gun shows, favored by
President Clinton.
 &HT;    After eight hours of attempted peace-making, weary gun
executives retired poolside for dinner, where a magician tried to
distract them with rope, coin and card tricks. In an interview
afterward, Delfay, the newly appointed head of the Heritage group,
fantasized about what the future might bring: ``I wish we could
make our problems go away like that magician made that ace of
spades disappear.''
 &HT;    But the gun makers' troubles, it seems, won't vanish by mere
sleight of hand; they require a more potent brand of alchemy.
 &HT;    High-profile gun incidents _ from the attempted assassinations
of President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II to school
shootings such as those in Jonesboro, Ark., and Littleton, Colo. _
provide fuel for the political debate.
 &HT;    For decades, major battles in the gun wars were waged in
legislative arenas. But late last year, frustrated by their lack of
progress and by 35,000 gun-related deaths per year, gun-control
proponents and mayors from around the country opened a potent new
front: the courts.
 &HT;    The first suits were filed in November by New Orleans and
Chicago. Both suits are testing some exotic legal theories, seeking
to hold the entire gun industry responsible for the costs to
society incurred by criminal or accidental misuse of guns.
 &HT;    The New Orleans suit, claiming that gun makers have violated a
Louisiana product-liability law by selling goods that are
``unreasonably dangerous,'' charges that 15 gun makers negligently
withheld safety features from their weapons.
 &HT;    The suit, bankrolled by New Orleans attorney Wendell Gauthier
and other lawyers from the legal war against Big Tobacco, employs
the tactics of lawsuits filed by states seeking compensation for
the public cost of smoking-related illnesses.
 &HT;    The Chicago suit alleges that gun makers, distributors and
suburban dealers oversupply the market with handguns, knowing that
they will be used in urban crimes. The suit cites a recent
undercover operation in which police, posing as motorcycle hoods,
street-gang members and mercenaries, bought 171 guns from suburban
dealers in the Chicago area and boasted that they would use them to
commit crimes in Chicago.
 &HT;    One example cites an undercover officer who bragged that the gun
would be used for a street shooting; the salesman allegedly
recommended a specific bullet for the job _ a bullet that wouldn't
go through the target ``and hit a little girl on the next block.''
 &HT;    So far, six cities _ Bridgeport, Connecticut, Miami-Dade County,
Atlanta and Cleveland, in addition to New Orleans and Chicago _
have filed suit. A number of others, including Newark and Boston,
have announced their intentions to board the legal bandwagon.
 &HT;    On Feb. 11 he legal picture got even bleaker for the gun
industry. That was the day a federal jury in Brooklyn returned a
$560,000 verdict in favor of Steven Fox, a 19-year-old man who had
survived an accidental shooting on a New York City street corner.
He had been joined by relatives of six homicide victims in a
class-action suit filed against 25 gun manufacturers and
distributors.
 &HT;    The Brooklyn case, filed in the mid-1990s, marked the first time
that a jury had found gun makers legally responsible for the misuse
of their products. It was also the first time that a whistle-blower
_ former Smith &AMP; Wesson senior vice president Robert Hass _ had
testified against an employer.
 &HT;    In a strategy the Chicago suit mirrors, the plaintiffs argued
that gun makers pumped weapons into states with permissive gun
laws, knowing the guns would find their way into the hands of urban
criminals.
 &HT;    Firearms executives smelled trouble when the case was assigned,
at the request of the plaintiffs' lawyer, to a liberal activist
judge. But they were even more stunned by the jury's verdict.
 &HT;    Fifteen of the 25 companies, including Colt and Beretta, were
found liable. The popular press characterized the decision as a
crushing defeat for the gun industry. But it was not a total loss:
Ten of the companies, including Smith &AMP; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co., were cleared, and only three of the companies had monetary
damages levied against them.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, damage had been done. The gun industry no longer
seemed quite so invincible.
 &HT;    The litigation could not have come at a worse moment. With $2
billion in annual sales, the gun industry has nothing like the deep
pockets of the tobacco industry, and some insiders predict a wave
of bankruptcies if the legal battles are prolonged.
 &HT;    The titans of the trade, Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. and Smith &AMP; Wesson,
each sell about $140 million worth of firearms each year. That's
less than two days' cigarette sales by Philip Morris Co. And
production of guns had dropped to 3.4 million in 1997, down from a
peak of 5.2 million in 1993, though it rebounded in 1998.
 &HT;    Whether or not the gun manufacturers begin to lose big in court,
the executives in Gun Valley are outraged by the incipient legal
tidal wave. They defiantly reject the notion that they could, or
should, do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or make
their products safer.
 &HT;    ``Do you really think I wake up in the morning and say, `Oh,
good, let's make guns so that kids can go out on the street and
shoot people'?'' demands Robin Sharpless, a vice president of H &AMP; R
1871 Inc., one of the nation's largest manufacturers of shotguns
and a defendant in the Chicago suit.
 &HT;    The Gardner, Mass.-based company, which employs 233 people, was
the first gun maker in the United States to allow electronic access
to its records. But the company is also known for its donation of
shotguns to hunter-education programs, a move that has been
criticized by gun-control groups as nothing more than a marketing
ploy to get kids hooked on guns. Sharpless counters that a ``wanton
process of demonization is underway.''
 &HT;    In North Haven, Conn., at the factory of shotgun manufacturer
O.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the frustration is equally palpable. ``We
want people to use our products safely,'' says Georgia Nichols,
Mossberg's vice president and general counsel, smacking her desk to
emphasize the point. ``We want to end crime and violence. We're
just like the business next door.''
 &HT;    Nichols is the president of the industry trade association the
American Shooting Sports Council, and her company was the second
firearms manufacturer in the United States to ship locking devices
with its guns. Her office is adorned with shotguns and rifles,
plaques from gun clubs, bumper stickers and signs: ``Save the
Male'' and ``I love animals. They're delicious!''
 &HT;    Nichols knows that the battles ahead will be fought not only in
the court of law but also in the court of public opinion. Where in
the popular press, she asks, are news stories about people who have
used their guns successfully for self-defense?
 &HT;    ``There are some wonderful stories about guns,'' says Nichols,
pausing midsentence to swallow. Anxious not to be misunderstood,
she adds: ``Wonderful in that lives have been saved.''
 &HT;    ``It's a pity,'' she says, ``those stories are never told.''
 &HT;    Seven months after President Clinton's 1997 State of the Union
address, in which he embraced the idea of legislation that would
mandate the sale of firearms with child safety locks, Shultz
announced that Smith &AMP; Wesson would voluntarily provide trigger
locks with all its guns. Shultz decided to move before Congress
beat him to the punch.
 &HT;    Every year, an estimated 200 children between the ages of 1 and
14 are accidentally killed by guns. Approximately the same number
of children each year die in bicycle accidents.
 &HT;    But the recent Colorado school shooting has the potential to
cause a major shift in the American gun debate. With both the NRA
and the firearms industry again on the defensive, gun-control
proponents are re-energized like never before.
 &HT;    At Smith &AMP; Wesson, Shultz is bracing for a protracted war.
``It's going to be a long, tough deal,'' he says of the looming
lawsuits.

 By JAMES BANDLER  
 FROM: The Boston Globe Magazine  
 &HT;    In New England, home to Smith &AMP; Wesson and Colt, firearms are
big business. But legal assaults and internal squabbles are
inflicting deep wounds on the industry.
 &HT;    The four-star Wigwam Resort outside Phoenix looks out over lush
golf courses and citrus groves to the Arizona desert and the purple
silhouettes of the White Tank Mountains beyond. But the firearms
industry executives who assembled there in February spent precious
little time admiring the scenery.
 &HT;    For the better part of two days, they sequestered themselves
inside a windowless conference room, emerging only to stretch their
legs and grab coffee and sandwiches. They had come on a survival
mission.
 &HT;    Just two weeks before, a New York jury had found that 15 handgun
makers had negligently marketed and distributed their weapons. The
suit was brought on behalf of shooting victims of urban violence.
 &HT;    The verdict sent a ripple of anxiety through the gun industry,
which, collectively, had never before been held legally responsible
for the negligent misuse of its products. And it emboldened
big-city mayors from around the country who were mounting their own
tobacco-style legal assault against firearms makers.
 &HT;    Now, the gun manufacturers were facing the specter of protracted
and expensive court battles that could bleed them dry. And the
stress was showing.
 &HT;    Robert Delfay, head of the Connecticut-based National Shooting
Sports Foundation and the host of the meeting, had been up since
2:30 a.m., preparing. ``I sleep like a baby,'' he recalled saying.
``I wake up every three hours crying.''
 &HT;    The group included some 30 top executives from around the
country, among them 10 from New England's influential ``Gun
Valley,'' the Connecticut River corridor of gun makers stretching
from New Hampshire to Long Island Sound. There were representatives
from O. F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons of North Haven, Conn.; Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co. Inc. of Southport, Conn.; Colt's Manufacturing Co. of Hartford;
and H &AMP; R 1871 Inc. of Gardner, Mass.
 &HT;    From Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp. of Springfield, Mass., the biggest
handgun manufacturer in the world, came Ed Shultz, a short and
plain-spoken pragmatist in an industry known for its ideologues.
 &HT;    Dismayed by the fractiousness that has plagued his industry for
years, Shultz studied his colleagues in the conference room,
wondering if they could mend their ways. From Shultz's perspective,
the last few months had not gone well. A legal-strategy meeting in
Tampa in November 1998 had ended with bruised egos and
door-slamming. The industry was riven by personality clashes, turf
battles, and the omnipresent conflicts between moderates and
hard-liners.
 &HT;    As the Phoenix meeting unfolded, the executives did their utmost
to present a unified front. The feuding trade groups were brought
together under the banner of a new organization, the Hunting and
Shooting Sports Heritage Foundation. To be funded by a voluntary
tax of 1 percent of member companies' annual sales, the new group
would coordinate the gun makers' legal and public-relations
counterattack.
 &HT;    One participant, James Garrison, CEO of H &AMP; R 1871 Inc., went so
far as to liken the gathering to the historic first session of the
United Nations in 1947. ``This is a revolutionary thing that
occurred,'' Garrison later recalled saying. ``For the first time, a
fractious industry has been unified. You have the whole industry
coming together.''
 &HT;    But some companies were already complaining that the new
Heritage Foundation board simply preserved the hegemony of old-line
manufacturers such as Colt, Remington, and Sturm, Ruger. Absent
from the board were the California makers of the so-called Saturday
night specials, inexpensive handguns associated with street crime.
Distributors and dealers also felt underrepresented.
 &HT;    And the new policy group had failed to quell disagreements over
strategy, including whether to support instant criminal background
checks of those purchasing firearms at gun shows, favored by
President Clinton.
 &HT;    After eight hours of attempted peace-making, weary gun
executives retired poolside for dinner, where a magician tried to
distract them with rope, coin and card tricks. In an interview
afterward, Delfay, the newly appointed head of the Heritage group,
fantasized about what the future might bring: ``I wish we could
make our problems go away like that magician made that ace of
spades disappear.''
 &HT;    But the gun makers' troubles, it seems, won't vanish by mere
sleight of hand; they require a more potent brand of alchemy.
 &HT;    High-profile gun incidents _ from the attempted assassinations
of President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II to school
shootings such as those in Jonesboro, Ark., and Littleton, Colo. _
provide fuel for the political debate.
 &HT;    For decades, major battles in the gun wars were waged in
legislative arenas. But late last year, frustrated by their lack of
progress and by 35,000 gun-related deaths per year, gun-control
proponents and mayors from around the country opened a potent new
front: the courts.
 &HT;    The first suits were filed in November by New Orleans and
Chicago. Both suits are testing some exotic legal theories, seeking
to hold the entire gun industry responsible for the costs to
society incurred by criminal or accidental misuse of guns.
 &HT;    The New Orleans suit, claiming that gun makers have violated a
Louisiana product-liability law by selling goods that are
``unreasonably dangerous,'' charges that 15 gun makers negligently
withheld safety features from their weapons.
 &HT;    The suit, bankrolled by New Orleans attorney Wendell Gauthier
and other lawyers from the legal war against Big Tobacco, employs
the tactics of lawsuits filed by states seeking compensation for
the public cost of smoking-related illnesses.
 &HT;    The Chicago suit alleges that gun makers, distributors and
suburban dealers oversupply the market with handguns, knowing that
they will be used in urban crimes. The suit cites a recent
undercover operation in which police, posing as motorcycle hoods,
street-gang members and mercenaries, bought 171 guns from suburban
dealers in the Chicago area and boasted that they would use them to
commit crimes in Chicago.
 &HT;    One example cites an undercover officer who bragged that the gun
would be used for a street shooting; the salesman allegedly
recommended a specific bullet for the job _ a bullet that wouldn't
go through the target ``and hit a little girl on the next block.''
 &HT;    So far, six cities _ Bridgeport, Connecticut, Miami-Dade County,
Atlanta and Cleveland, in addition to New Orleans and Chicago _
have filed suit. A number of others, including Newark and Boston,
have announced their intentions to board the legal bandwagon.
 &HT;    On Feb. 11 the legal picture got even bleaker for the gun
industry. That was the day a federal jury in Brooklyn returned a
$560,000 verdict in favor of Steven Fox, a 19-year-old man who had
survived an accidental shooting on a New York City street corner.
He had been joined by relatives of six homicide victims in a
class-action suit filed against 25 gun manufacturers and
distributors.
 &HT;    The Brooklyn case, filed in the mid-1990s, marked the first time
that a jury had found gun makers legally responsible for the misuse
of their products. It was also the first time that a whistle-blower
_ former Smith &AMP; Wesson senior vice president Robert Hass _ had
testified against an employer.
 &HT;    In a strategy the Chicago suit mirrors, the plaintiffs argued
that gun makers pumped weapons into states with permissive gun
laws, knowing the guns would find their way into the hands of urban
criminals.
 &HT;    Firearms executives smelled trouble when the case was assigned,
at the request of the plaintiffs' lawyer, to a liberal activist
judge. But they were even more stunned by the jury's verdict.
 &HT;    Fifteen of the 25 companies, including Colt and Beretta, were
found liable. The popular press characterized the decision as a
crushing defeat for the gun industry. But it was not a total loss:
Ten of the companies, including Smith &AMP; Wesson and Sturm, Ruger &AMP;
Co., were cleared, and only three of the companies had monetary
damages levied against them.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, damage had been done. The gun industry no longer
seemed quite so invincible.
 &HT;    The litigation could not have come at a worse moment. With $2
billion in annual sales, the gun industry has nothing like the deep
pockets of the tobacco industry, and some insiders predict a wave
of bankruptcies if the legal battles are prolonged.
 &HT;    The titans of the trade, Sturm, Ruger &AMP; Co. and Smith &AMP; Wesson,
each sell about $140 million worth of firearms each year. That's
less than two days' cigarette sales by Philip Morris Co. And
production of guns had dropped to 3.4 million in 1997, down from a
peak of 5.2 million in 1993, though it rebounded in 1998.
 &HT;    Whether or not the gun manufacturers begin to lose big in court,
the executives in Gun Valley are outraged by the incipient legal
tidal wave. They defiantly reject the notion that they could, or
should, do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals or make
their products safer.
 &HT;    ``Do you really think I wake up in the morning and say, `Oh,

 By JILL ABRAMSON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The vice president stood before 40 wealthy Democrats in the
Fifth Avenue palazzo of the Lazard Freres executive Steven Rattner,
a stunning place with marble columns and a view over the
Metropolitan Museum.
 &HT;    The guests, bathed in candlelight, nibbled at apple crisp and
whipped cream. To be here, each had promised to raise at least
$35,000 for Al Gore's presidential quest.
 &HT;    Gore began by recognizing some of the more luminous luminaries
in the room _ Eugene Ludwig, the former comptroller of the
Currency; Richard Gardner, former ambassador to Spain and Italy;
and a raft of Wall Street heavyweights.
 &HT;    Then it was time for a joke: the one Gore tells at every
fund-raiser, about an 8-year-old boy in Minnesota who wrote Gore a
sort of fan letter that called him ``the greatest vice president of
my time.'' There was a polite titter.
 &HT;    As Gore moved on to his studiously rehearsed vision for the 21st
century, the overwhelming impression was of a marble candidate in a
marble setting.
 &HT;    So far in this young campaign, the issues that Gore loves _ from
his ``practical idealism'' to his ``electronic-privacy bill of
rights'' _ have lacked a certain electricity.
 &HT;    But that is not to say that the Gore 2000 effort is a listless
one. To the contrary, the candidate may still seem like the robot
caricature of a thousand late-night monologues, but his campaign's
fund-raising calls to mind a dizzyingly effective machine.
 &HT;    In the first three months of 1999 alone, Gore fund-raisers piled
up $8.9 million in contributions - easily a record, and a sum that
has scared off all challengers for the Democratic nomination except
Bill Bradley.
 &HT;    Between now and the Democratic convention in Los Angeles in
August 2000, Gore intends to raise a staggering $55 million. The
soul of this fund-raising machine is the candidate himself, with
his vast and assiduously built network of supporters stretching
from his native Tennessee to Wall Street and west to Silicon Valley
and Hollywood, his reputation as an outstanding bottom-line
salesman and his plain old tirelessness.
 &HT;    Gore will spend countless hours on the
free-range-chicken-and-Chardonnay circuit in the months ahead,
rolling out a green carpet leading (he hopes) straight to the
Democratic nomination.
 &HT;    A massive early war chest is more important in this election
than ever before because New York and California, both key,
expensive states, now have early primaries. Gore's facility with
total-immersion fund-raising, then, may be his greatest strength.
 &HT;    Yet it may also prove to be his greatest vulnerability. There is
the danger that Gore will ultimately focus too much on
fund-raising, because he's simply so good at it, instead of solving
his campaign's weaknesses _ such as finding the issues and the
message that broad swaths of voters can really get excited about.
 &HT;    If he does not do this, and thus move the story of his campaign
away from fund-raising, the defining impression left in the minds
of the electorate could simply be his ability to charm the
deep-pockets crowd. That could be disastrous at a moment when his
standing in the polls is anemic and campaign-finance reform is
popular.
 &HT;    Gore's opponents are no doubt aware of this potential weakness.
Before it's all over, there will almost certainly be attack ads
from foes recalling his role in the 1996 election as the Democratic
Party's ``solicitor in chief,'' cold-calling donors for cash, not
to mention his star turn with a chorus line of Buddhist nuns in
saffron robes.
 &HT;    ``Political money is the wrong game to monopolize in the year
2000,'' says Fred Wertheimer, a campaign-finance-reform advocate.
``That's particularly true for Gore,'' Wertheimer adds, because of
the 1996 scandals. ``By raising so much money, Gore has become
emblematic of the Washington money culture that the American people
find repugnant,'' Wertheimer continues. ``It's a high-risk
strategy.''
 &HT;    Even so, for Gore or any other candidate these days,
fund-raising remains a necessity, not an option. Gore declined to
speak with me on the record about fund-raising, but did allow me,
as his campaign kicked into high gear, to tag along and get a
firsthand look at events that are generally off-limits to the
press.
 &HT;    The day that ended at chez Rattner was a typical jumble of
official appearances sandwiched between unofficial schmooze
sessions with fat cats. It began in the Bronx at the Helen Keller
Elementary School in the heart of the Co-op City housing
development, where Gore read aloud to a second-grader dressed in a
neat uniform, who confided that she wants his job someday.
 &HT;    Then the motorcade rushed him to a private dining room at the
Four Seasons, where he joined rich Manhattan executives for a feast
of black bass with squid-ink risotto. In the afternoon, there were
private chats with other prominent New York Democrats.
 &HT;    For cocktails, Gore met with a group of African-American
business leaders who have each pledged to raise $5,000 for the
campaign, at an apartment on upper Park Avenue. Dinner, with a
$10,000-a-head bounty, was with a group of executives from the
communications industry at the trendy East Side restaurant Daniel.
And finally, dessert at Rattner's.
 &HT;    The day's take: an impressive $1.5 million.
 &HT;    What is Gore's appeal? David Geffen, sitting in his $47.5
million, nine-acre Beverly Hills estate, tells me that he finds
fund-raising ``time-consuming and irritating.'' But he intends to
spend a lot of time doing it for Gore.
 &HT;    ``I view this as an important election,'' says the Hollywood
mogul, clad in a white polo shirt, jeans and white sneakers.
``We're going to work very hard to elect Gore and replace the most
radical House and Senate in history.''
 &HT;    Seated next to Geffen is Andy Spahn, formerly Gary Hart's
national finance director and now a fund-raising and political
adviser to Geffen and his Dreamworks partners, Steven Spielberg and
Jeffrey Katzenberg. Geffen and Spahn say they will very likely hold
a dinner for Gore later in the campaign, much like the intimate
1996 meals Bill Clinton shared with Geffen and 15 or so Hollywood
execs, where $2 million was raised.
 &HT;    ``My biggest worry about the vice president between now and the
election is that he become the best communicator he can be,''
Geffen says. He worries that Gore does not have the sparkle that
his boss transmits so effortlessly. Some of Gore's other Hollywood
supporters voice the same concern. Famous directors such as
Spielberg and Rob Reiner are eager to race to Washington to give
their man some emergency speech coaching.
 &HT;    ``He's really funny, but he has a hard time letting his natural
personality emerge,'' frets Reiner, whose film ``An American
President,'' about a picture-perfect commander in chief, was made
with research help from Gore's staff.
 &HT;    The key to fund-raising is one-to-one networking, and Gore has
proven extremely effective at tapping connections from every phase
of his life. In Hollywood, for example, his longtime ambassador is
John Cooke, a Disney executive, who expects Gore's California
effort to raise millions. While Bradley has longstanding
friendships in Hollywood and is close to the Disney chairman,
Michael Eisner, as well as to Barry Diller, Gore has sewn up the
team from Dreamworks.
 &HT;    Farther up the coast are the executives in the high-tech
industry who have dubbed themselves the Gore Techs. During the
second Clinton-Gore inauguration, the vice president set aside two
hours to meet with a dozen executives from Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The group, which included the high-tech venture capitalist John
Doerr, the Intuit chairman Scott Cook and the Marimba software
founder Kim Polese, were wowed by Gore's fluency with the New
Economy.
 &HT;    ``He really gets it,'' says Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite,
who has attended several Gore Tech meetings and has kicked in
$1,000 to Gore.
 &HT;    At a Gore fund-raiser last month at the Woodside, Calif.,
mansion of Janina Pawlowski, co-founder of E-Loan, his Silicon
Valley supporters raised $400,000 for their candidate.
 &HT;    Besides the nice turnout and breathtaking view, Gore had a rare
loose public moment. He and Tipper bopped with a band that included
two former members of the Grateful Dead; Tipper even played the
bongos. Then they repaired to dinner at Doerr's house with 30
Democratic donors, who raised $10,000 apiece.
 &HT;    John Tyson, an international business investor, is even raising
money from Gore's class at Harvard, where he was one of the future
vice president's roommates. He recalls long discussions with Gore
about Vietnam and civil rights as they lay in their bunk beds.
 &HT;    ``I always knew he'd be president,'' Tyson says. ``He does well
in an environment where there is a lot of pressure.'' At a recent
gala in Washington, Tyson solicited $20,000 from the class of '69,
and is now expanding his efforts to other classes.
 &HT;    Gore's prowess at the money game is one of the things that
attracted Bill Clinton in 1992. As magnetic as Clinton was on the
fund-raising circuit, he always hated actually asking for money.
Gore, in contrast, is known as the best ``closer'' in the business,
someone who can get contributors to commit to a specific amount and
write their checks on the spot.
 &HT;    When he was a senator, his family kept an apartment on Capitol
Hill that he used as a fund-raising safe house, where he could make
calls between votes. And he did not disappoint Clinton, helping
raise millions after he joined the ticket in 1992 and a staggering
$40 million for the party in 1996.
 &HT;    Add to the Gore network, then, some of Clinton's cash
constituencies. One is Wall Street, although there is some
lingering doubt over the vice president's environmentalism, which
some deem as antibusiness. Gore has strategically set his sights on
some of the party's younger financial powers _ such as his recent
host, Rattner.
 &HT;    During the 1996 campaign, he orchestrated a seat next to Rattner
at a fund-raising reception and subsequently called him to seek his
counsel on economic issues. When it came time to gear up the 2000
fund-raising effort, Rattner signed on to play his part in a
process that even he concedes ``could not possibly be what
Jefferson had in mind.''
 &HT;    While politicians pay lip service to the need for Congress to
pass campaign-finance reform, the bottom line is that in the
absence of such reforms, they will play by the rules of the game as
they exist, and play with a vengeance. Skyrocketing campaign costs
have sparked the fund-raising equivalent of a nuclear arms race,
and the 2000 election will be the most money-infused in history.
 &HT;    George W. Bush raised $7.6 million in the first three months of
1999, while Bradley managed to pull in a respectable $4.3 million.
 &HT;    Post-Watergate election-law reforms aside, the campaign-finance
system has become shot through with loopholes. Laws limiting
individuals to giving $1,000 during the primaries simply mean an
emphasis on rounding up donors who have lots of friends who can
also write $1,000 checks.
 &HT;    Candidates who accept federal matching funds must limit their
spending to $33.5 million in the primaries, but there are legal
ways to skirt the rules. Money spent on fund-raising and on legal
and accounting costs does not count toward the limit, and
candidates are allowed to establish separate funds for complying
with the arcane and complex federal election laws.
 &HT;    In the general election, there is a much bigger loophole to
exploit. Although the nominees don't raise any more private money
and receive $70 million in public funds for the general election,
parties can raise ``soft money'' _ unrestricted donations from
unions, wealthy individuals and corporations _ to help elect their
candidates. The two parties combined raised more than $250 million
in such contributions in 1996 _ and it was in the soft-money arena
that most of the campaign fund-raising abuses occurred.
 &HT;    The ghosts of past scandals loom over Gore's current efforts
more than anyone else's. ``There will be heightened scrutiny after
1996,'' says Lyn Utrecht, outside counsel to the Gore campaign. So
the vice president's finance and legal advisers have created an
unusually onerous set of fund-raising rules.
 &HT;    First and foremost, Gore will not personally solicit donors with
telephone calls, a practice he stopped in 1997. He has also vowed
not to use his official residence for ticketed fund-raising events.
 &HT;    Campaign lawyers have held more than 300 briefings on election
law for volunteer solicitors, and the campaign is scrutinizing the
backgrounds of all solicitors and any checks drawn on foreign bank
accounts. Campaign workers are told to follow even the smallest
rules, right down to making sure all solicitation letters go out on
campaign stationery.
 &HT;    Still, concedes Gore's campaign manager, Craig Smith, ``No
system is going to be perfect.'' In fact, there have already been a
few glitches. Some suspicious donations that came in money orders
may be returned. And the 850,000 pieces of direct mail sent out by
the campaign in February went to some donors whose checks the
campaign would not want.
 &HT;    Among the recipients: Johnny Chung, the California donor who
recently told federal investigators that some of the $400,000 he
had contributed to Democrats (since returned) came from the Chinese
military.
 &HT;    Some of Gore's longtime fund-raisers are clearly irritated with
the ``by the book'' mentality. A Miami solicitor complained that he
had to get the text of his thank-you notes to donors approved by
Washington. A solicitor in Los Angeles griped about being inactive
while a background check was run: ``I could have raised $100,000 in
those two weeks.''
 &HT;    But perhaps most critically, Gore, to maintain his front-runner
status, may concentrate too much on the money. That's what Gary
Koops thinks is happening, and his opinion is worth a listen. Now a
Washington public-relations consultant, Koops was an adviser to
Sen. Phil Gramm in 1996 _ when Gramm raised $8 million in the first
three months of 1995, setting a record that Gore has just beaten.
 &HT;    Gramm too was a powerful fund-raiser, and he didn't even make it
to the primaries. As Koops puts it: ``'We've got the money' isn't a
good campaign message.''

 By JILL ABRAMSON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The vice president stood before 40 wealthy Democrats in the
Fifth Avenue palazzo of the Lazard Freres executive Steven Rattner,
a stunning place with marble columns and a view over the
Metropolitan Museum.
 &HT;    The guests, bathed in candlelight, nibbled at apple crisp and
whipped cream. To be here, each had promised to raise at least
$35,000 for Al Gore's presidential quest.
 &HT;    Gore began by recognizing some of the more luminous luminaries
in the room _ Eugene Ludwig, the former comptroller of the
Currency; Richard Gardner, former ambassador to Spain and Italy;
and a raft of Wall Street heavyweights.
 &HT;    Then it was time for a joke: the one Gore tells at every
fund-raiser, about an 8-year-old boy in Minnesota who wrote Gore a
sort of fan letter that called him ``the greatest vice president of
my time.'' There was a polite titter.
 &HT;    As Gore moved on to his studiously rehearsed vision for the 21st
century, the overwhelming impression was of a marble candidate in a
marble setting.
 &HT;    So far in this young campaign, the issues that Gore loves _ from
his ``practical idealism'' to his ``electronic-privacy bill of
rights'' _ have lacked a certain electricity.
 &HT;    But that is not to say that the Gore 2000 effort is a listless
one. To the contrary, the candidate may still seem like the robot
caricature of a thousand late-night monologues, but his campaign's
fund-raising calls to mind a dizzyingly effective machine.
 &HT;    In the first three months of 1999 alone, Gore fund-raisers piled
up $8.9 million in contributions - easily a record, and a sum that
has scared off all challengers for the Democratic nomination except
Bill Bradley.
 &HT;    Between now and the Democratic convention in Los Angeles in
August 2000, Gore intends to raise a staggering $55 million. The
soul of this fund-raising machine is the candidate himself, with
his vast and assiduously built network of supporters stretching
from his native Tennessee to Wall Street and west to Silicon Valley
and Hollywood, his reputation as an outstanding bottom-line
salesman and his plain old tirelessness.
 &HT;    Gore will spend countless hours on the
free-range-chicken-and-Chardonnay circuit in the months ahead,
rolling out a green carpet leading (he hopes) straight to the
Democratic nomination.
 &HT;    A massive early war chest is more important in this election
than ever before because New York and California, both key,
expensive states, now have early primaries. Gore's facility with
total-immersion fund-raising, then, may be his greatest strength.
 &HT;    Yet it may also prove to be his greatest vulnerability. There is
the danger that Gore will ultimately focus too much on
fund-raising, because he's simply so good at it, instead of solving
his campaign's weaknesses _ such as finding the issues and the
message that broad swaths of voters can really get excited about.
 &HT;    If he does not do this, and thus move the story of his campaign
away from fund-raising, the defining impression left in the minds
of the electorate could simply be his ability to charm the
deep-pockets crowd. That could be disastrous at a moment when his
standing in the polls is anemic and campaign-finance reform is
popular.
 &HT;    Gore's opponents are no doubt aware of this potential weakness.
Before it's all over, there will almost certainly be attack ads
from foes recalling his role in the 1996 election as the Democratic
Party's ``solicitor in chief,'' cold-calling donors for cash, not
to mention his star turn with a chorus line of Buddhist nuns in
saffron robes.
 &HT;    ``Political money is the wrong game to monopolize in the year
2000,'' says Fred Wertheimer, a campaign-finance-reform advocate.
``That's particularly true for Gore,'' Wertheimer adds, because of
the 1996 scandals. ``By raising so much money, Gore has become
emblematic of the Washington money culture that the American people
find repugnant,'' Wertheimer continues. ``It's a high-risk
strategy.''
 &HT;    Even so, for Gore or any other candidate these days,
fund-raising remains a necessity, not an option. Gore declined to
speak with me on the record about fund-raising, but did allow me,
as his campaign kicked into high gear, to tag along and get a
firsthand look at events that are generally off-limits to the
press.
 &HT;    The day that ended at chez Rattner was a typical jumble of
official appearances sandwiched between unofficial schmooze
sessions with fat cats. It began in the Bronx at the Helen Keller
Elementary School in the heart of the Co-op City housing
development, where Gore read aloud to a second-grader dressed in a
neat uniform, who confided that she wants his job someday.
 &HT;    Then the motorcade rushed him to a private dining room at the
Four Seasons, where he joined rich Manhattan executives for a feast
of black bass with squid-ink risotto. In the afternoon, there were
private chats with other prominent New York Democrats.
 &HT;    For cocktails, Gore met with a group of African-American
business leaders who have each pledged to raise $5,000 for the
campaign, at an apartment on upper Park Avenue. Dinner, with a
$10,000-a-head bounty, was with a group of executives from the
communications industry at the trendy East Side restaurant Daniel.
And finally, dessert at Rattner's.
 &HT;    The day's take: an impressive $1.5 million.
 &HT;    What is Gore's appeal? David Geffen, sitting in his $47.5
million, nine-acre Beverly Hills estate, tells me that he finds
fund-raising ``time-consuming and irritating.'' But he intends to
spend a lot of time doing it for Gore.
 &HT;    ``I view this as an important election,'' says the Hollywood
mogul, clad in a white polo shirt, jeans and white sneakers.
``We're going to work very hard to elect Gore and replace the most
radical House and Senate in history.''
 &HT;    Seated next to Geffen is Andy Spahn, formerly Gary Hart's
national finance director and now a fund-raising and political
adviser to Geffen and his Dreamworks partners, Steven Spielberg and
Jeffrey Katzenberg. Geffen and Spahn say they will very likely hold
a dinner for Gore later in the campaign, much like the intimate
1996 meals Bill Clinton shared with Geffen and 15 or so Hollywood
execs, where $2 million was raised.
 &HT;    ``My biggest worry about the vice president between now and the
election is that he become the best communicator he can be,''
Geffen says. He worries that Gore does not have the sparkle that
his boss transmits so effortlessly. Some of Gore's other Hollywood
supporters voice the same concern. Famous directors such as
Spielberg and Rob Reiner are eager to race to Washington to give
their man some emergency speech coaching.
 &HT;    ``He's really funny, but he has a hard time letting his natural
personality emerge,'' frets Reiner, whose film ``An American
President,'' about a picture-perfect commander in chief, was made
with research help from Gore's staff.
 &HT;    The key to fund-raising is one-to-one networking, and Gore has
proven extremely effective at tapping connections from every phase
of his life. In Hollywood, for example, his longtime ambassador is
John Cooke, a Disney executive, who expects Gore's California
effort to raise millions. While Bradley has longstanding
friendships in Hollywood and is close to the Disney chairman,
Michael Eisner, as well as to Barry Diller, Gore has sewn up the
team from Dreamworks.
 &HT;    Farther up the coast are the executives in the high-tech
industry who have dubbed themselves the Gore Techs. During the
second Clinton-Gore inauguration, the vice president set aside two
hours to meet with a dozen executives from Silicon Valley.
 &HT;    The group, which included the high-tech venture capitalist John
Doerr, the Intuit chairman Scott Cook and the Marimba software
founder Kim Polese, were wowed by Gore's fluency with the New
Economy.
 &HT;    ``He really gets it,'' says Joe Kraus, the co-founder of Excite,
who has attended several Gore Tech meetings and has kicked in
$1,000 to Gore.
 &HT;    At a Gore fund-raiser last month at the Woodside, Calif.,
mansion of Janina Pawlowski, co-founder of E-Loan, his Silicon
Valley supporters raised $400,000 for their candidate.
 &HT;    Besides the nice turnout and breathtaking view, Gore had a rare
loose public moment. He and Tipper bopped with a band that included
two former members of the Grateful Dead; Tipper even played the
bongos. Then they repaired to dinner at Doerr's house with 30
Democratic donors, who raised $10,000 apiece.
 &HT;    John Tyson, an international business investor, is even raising
money from Gore's class at Harvard, where he was one of the future
vice president's roommates. He recalls long discussions with Gore
about Vietnam and civil rights as they lay in their bunk beds.
 &HT;    ``I always knew he'd be president,'' Tyson says. ``He does well
in an environment where there is a lot of pressure.'' At a recent
gala in Washington, Tyson solicited $20,000 from the class of '69,
and is now expanding his efforts to other classes.
 &HT;    Gore's prowess at the money game is one of the things that
attracted Bill Clinton in 1992. As magnetic as Clinton was on the
fund-raising circuit, he always hated actually asking for money.
Gore, in contrast, is known as the best ``closer'' in the business,
someone who can get contributors to commit to a specific amount and
write their checks on the spot.
 &HT;    When he was a senator, his family kept an apartment on Capitol
Hill that he used as a fund-raising safe house, where he could make
calls between votes. And he did not disappoint Clinton, helping
raise millions after he joined the ticket in 1992 and a staggering
$40 million for the party in 1996.
 &HT;    Add to the Gore network, then, some of Clinton's cash
constituencies. One is Wall Street, although there is some
lingering doubt over the vice president's environmentalism, which
some deem as antibusiness. Gore has strategically set his sights on
some of the party's younger financial powers _ such as his recent
host, Rattner.
 &HT;    During the 1996 campaign, he orchestrated a seat next to Rattner
at a fund-raising reception and subsequently called him to seek his
counsel on economic issues. When it came time to gear up the 2000
fund-raising effort, Rattner signed on to play his part in a
process that even he concedes ``could not possibly be what
Jefferson had in mind.''
 &HT;    While politicians pay lip service to the need for Congress to
pass campaign-finance reform, the bottom line is that in the
absence of such reforms, they will play by the rules of the game as
they exist, and play with a vengeance. Skyrocketing campaign costs
have sparked the fund-raising equivalent of a nuclear arms race,
and the 2000 election will be the most money-infused in history.
 &HT;    George W. Bush raised $7.6 million in the first three months of
1999, while Bradley managed to pull in a respectable $4.3 million.
 &HT;    Post-Watergate election-law reforms aside, the campaign-finance
system has become shot through with loopholes. Laws limiting
individuals to giving $1,000 during the primaries simply mean an
emphasis on rounding up donors who have lots of friends who can
also write $1,000 checks.
 &HT;    Candidates who accept federal matching funds must limit their
spending to $33.5 million in the primaries, but there are legal
ways to skirt the rules. Money spent on fund-raising and on legal
and accounting costs does not count toward the limit, and
candidates are allowed to establish separate funds for complying
with the arcane and complex federal election laws.
 &HT;    In the general election, there is a much bigger loophole to
exploit. Although the nominees don't raise any more private money
and receive $70 million in public funds for the general election,
parties can raise ``soft money'' _ unrestricted donations from
unions, wealthy individuals and corporations _ to help elect their
candidates. The two parties combined raised more than $250 million

 &HT;    The ghosts of past scandals loom over Gore's current efforts

the vice president's finance and legal advisers have created an

 &HT;    First and foremost, Gore will not personally solicit donors with

 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Dieu-Donni Bima Bima is a nice young man with a gentle manner.
With becoming modesty, he describes how the chopped-up bodies of
three gorillas have come to be smoking over a fire outside his hut.
 &HT;    ``I shot the big male as it charged me. The baby was on the
mother's back, and when she turned around to look at me the baby
did, too.'' He does an imitation of a tiny scrunched face peering
at him.
 &HT;    ``I shot her in the face, and the bullet went through it too _
bouf! One bullet, two gorillas!'' he concludes triumphantly.
 &HT;    As a horrified listener clutches his chest, he laughs. ``Why do
you want to protect gorillas? They're just animals.''
 &HT;    Deep in Central Africa, the great humanlike apes _ gorillas and
chimpanzees _ are rapidly being wiped out by hunters. Bima Bima
will make about $60 for each adult gorilla, and would get nearly as
much for a full-grown chimpanzee. Chimps with their heads and hands
removed are sold as gorilla meat.
 &HT;    Much as that distresses conservationists, the need to stop the
hunting has suddenly taken on more urgency in the West. In January,
scientists announced that HIV-1, the most common AIDS virus, came
from the subspecies of chimpanzee found here, Pan troglodytes
troglodytes.
 &HT;    They believe it passed into humans when hunters nicked
themselves butchering their kill or ate raw meat. Since the chimps
don't seem to get sick from it, they may be the key to a cure. It's
crucial that they be kept alive and are studied _ but that's not
the fate they're headed for now.
 &HT;    Until recently, the great rain forest stretching from Nigeria to
Rwanda belonged largely to Pygmies hunting with poisoned arrows.
Nibbling at the forest's edges, they posed no more threat to the
species within than the plains Indians did to the vast American
bison herds. But logging roads, shotguns and trucks are doing what
the horse, Winchester and railroad did to the buffalo.
 &HT;    As loggers extend a spider web of roads into the rain forest,
hunters are moving down them, snaring or shooting anything that
moves. There may be fewer than 120,000 troglodytes chimpanzees
left, and thousands are killed each year. They reproduce more
slowly than humans, one baby every four years.
 &HT;    Dr. Beatrice H. Hahn led a team from the University of Alabama
at Birmingham that proved the link between AIDS and chimps.
Research has established that the pandemic form of HIV-1 probably
began to spread in humans in the early 1940s. Hahn showed that it
came from the simian immunode-ficiency virus in troglodytes chimps.
 &HT;    What researchers most want to know is why the simian virus
doesn't kill the host apes. To that end, they need to know how
widespread infection is in the wild, which they might be able to
determine from stool samples gathered from the forest floor. And
they need blood samples drawn from wild animals.
 &HT;    ``These chimps are information we need,'' says Hahn, who has
become an antihunting campaigner. ``Killing them for the pot is
like burning a library full of books you haven't read yet.''
 &HT;    Environmentalists once thought most apes were killed in attempts
to steal their babies for the illegal pet trade. But that's wrong _
surviving babies are just extra cash for hunters supplying the
growing fad for ``bush meat'' on the tables of the elite in
Cameroon, Gabon, the Congo, the Central African Republic and other
countries.
 &HT;    Hunting endangered species is illegal, of course, but the law is
rarely enforced here. The bush-meat market in Yaounde, Cameroon's
capital, is no secret. It's a 500-foot stretch of sidewalk only a
few blocks from the presidential offices and the $200-a-night
Hilton Hotel.
 &HT;    Vendors desultorily wave whisks over tables piled high with
smoked and fresh monkeys, duikers (tiny antelopes), bush pigs and
skinned snakes. Just behind them, watched over by rough-looking
men, are piles from which long arm bones protrude, obviously those
of chimpanzees and gorillas. At the fetish stalls, you can buy
chimpanzee hands, gorilla skulls, round slices of elephant trunk or
the bright red tails of endangered gray parrots.
 &HT;    ``If your child is weak and you want to make him big and strong,
you feed him gorilla meat,'' says Elie Bayoi, a vendor. ``Or you
can scrape the shoulder bone into water and bathe him in that. If
you have a broken bone, you heat a chimpanzee skull and press it
against the break.''
 &HT;    Chimpanzee hands cure stomach pains, he adds. Elephant skin
repels garden pests. The market isn't hidden, but the vendors are
touchy. Even the chatty Bayoi refuses to let his stall be
photographed; other vendors have mobbed photographers.
 &HT;    Karl Ammann is a Swiss hotelier who fell in love with the apes
he photographed while running luxury camps in Africa. He has since
become the chief nemesis of the bush-meat trade, and persona non
grata to governments whose indifference he exposes. He has spent
years photographing the trade, sometimes with concealed cameras.
 &HT;    ``The big conservation groups say only poor Pygmies eat bush
meat, but look at these customers,'' he says on a walk through the
market. ``Look how they're dressed _ they're middle class. People
don't want beef or chicken anymore _ they call it 'white man's
meat.' I know a woman who has to take chimpanzee meat to her family
whenever she goes home. You can order a gorilla for Christmas the
same way I'd order a turkey.''
 &HT;    To prove the point to a German television crew, he recently
bought two heads: a chimp's and a pig's. The chimp was $8, the
bigger, meatier pig only $5. Two gorilla arms cost $10, an equal
weight of beef less than $4. Ammann has a teen-age chimp at his
Kenya home, and even on a visit to the tiny Yaounde zoo, it's clear
that he is drawn to apes. He makes ooh-ooh noises and puts his head
in the hands they stretch through the bars to groom him.
 &HT;    ``They have feelings and emotions,'' he says afterward, turning
angry. ``A wounded chimp will beg for its life. They're like
retarded children, and we don't eat THEM. Where do we draw the
line?''
 &HT;    The DNA of chimpanzees is 98.5 percent the same as that of
humans, and Ammann calls eating them ``98.5 percent cannibalism.''
 &HT;    More mainstream conservationists have asked him to temper his
language, saying it smacks of ``cultural imperialism.'' One is
Steve Gartlan, head of the World Wide Fund for Nature's Cameroon
office. Vivid photographs of dead apes and reminders of their human
qualities are ``emotionally understandable but biologically
unsound'' since whole ecosystems need protection, he argued in a
long critique of one of Ammann's articles. He also expressed
sympathy for the hunters, saying, ``We share an even larger
percentage of our genes _ 100 percent _ with the rural poor.''
 &HT;    At the urging of the fund, Cameroon has designated three new
parks, though Ammann dismisses them as mere ``lines on paper.''
According to a report provided on condition of anonymity by a
scientist working in the 3,300-square-mile Dja Reserve in southwest
Cameroon, about 100 hunters are camped inside. ``Despite the
European conservation money poured into the region,'' it says,
``unique species are being wiped out at an alarming rate.''
 &HT;    The explosion in bush-meat hunting is being propelled by two
converging forces: logging and corruption. As prices for coffee,
cocoa and oil have fallen, timber exports have soared. The roads
bulldozed to reach the 800-year-old hardwoods are wider and
smoother than the dirt national highways.
 &HT;    Rather than pay to ship beef or pork to the jungle dormitory
towns where their workers live, the logging companies encourage
hunting. The hundreds of log trucks headed for the coast become a
bush-meat caravan. Bleeding bags of meat can be spotted behind the
cabs; the drivers get a cut.
 &HT;    The political will to stop the hunting simply does not exist.
Hunters rent their guns from army and police officers; there are
roadblocks everywhere where police could seize the meat, but they
let anyone through for a $2 bribe; government officials serve bush
meat at banquets.
 &HT;    Transparency International, a not-for-profit corruption-fighting
group, recently rated Cameroon the most corrupt country of the 85
it surveyed. Next-door, Nigeria, famous for corruption, was only
No. 81.
 &HT;    Cameroonians say the problem is just getting worse. ``When I
came here in 1988, it was forbidden to kill animals,'' says Ndzana
Ndzana, an environmental official whose territory includes the
Gabon camp. ``But we had guns then. We had vehicles. We had
bullets. Now, with the economic crisis, the central government
gives us nothing. We can't do our jobs.'' Bima Bima, the hunter,
has agreed to join a project that Ammann wants to start. They hope
to find a group of gorillas they can protect and habituate to
humans, so they can prove that ``gorilla tourism,'' like that which
existed in Uganda until recently, is profitable.
 &HT;    Joseph Melloh, the first hunter Ammann converted to his cause,
will be in charge. For him, it's business. ``A gorilla is still
meat _ it has no soul,'' he says. ``But now I know that if you kill
a gorilla, you use it once. But if you keep it for 30 years, and
bring people to see it, you get more money. And you don't have to
carry the firewood to smoke it.''
 &HT;    Changing Africans' feelings about eating apes will be hard, Hahn
says. ``But it can be done,'' she says confidently. ``The Japanese
like to eat whales, but whales were being exterminated, so their
behavior is changing. And conserving chimpanzees might turn out to
be even more important than conserving whales or elephants or
rhinos.''
 &HT;    There's no guarantee that simian studies will reveal a cure or
vaccine for AIDS. But the extinction of vital chimpanzee species
surely guarantees that they won't.

 &HT;    For me, the final straw was Huairou. Not everyone will remember
Huairou, but some of us will never forget it.
 &HT;    Huairou was the Chinese village which in 1995 was transformed
for a few days into a sea of tents, huts, makeshift wooden walkways
and mud, when more than 20,000 women from around the world met
there for the United Nations' fourth world conference on women.
 &HT;    For sheer color, the occasion was not to be missed. Saudi women
covered in black jostled with American feminists wearing ``Why have
sex when you can have gender?'' T-shirts. Workshops on
``stereotyping and sexism in advertising'' (sponsored by the
Montreal Council of Women) were held a few feet away from tents
where Cambodian peasant women in national dress were sewing a quilt
in honor of the conference. Tanzanian women sold brightly-colored
scarves; Singaporean women distributed fresh flowers, ``flown here
courtesy of Singapore Airlines''; the American Association for the
Advancement of Science was answering questions about teaching
science to girls.
 &HT;    Just occasionally, the different worlds were forced into awkward
confrontation.
 &HT;    At a workshop entitled ``Politics of difference: single women,''
a few Third World women turned up expecting to talk about
prostitutes, and the pressures on women in traditional societies to
marry the men of their families' choice. An articulate Indian woman
stood up and gave a moving speech about shelters which she had
organized for women who run away from their violent husbands, and
are subsequently shunned by communities which simply do not
recognize the right of women to live alone.
 &HT;    A few Americans turned up at the meeting too to talk about the
difficulty of living alone in Philadelphia (``People, like, think
you're lesbian''). Throughout the workshop, the two sides listened
to one another in incomprehending silence.
 &HT;    Most of the time they didn't bother to listen to each other at
all. The Africans were talking about clean water and basic
education for girls. Women from Islamic countries were arguing
about whether to wear veils. The Americans were talking about
``breaking the glass ceiling,'' and the French about the literary
significance of ``the Other.''
 &HT;    I left Huairou filled with admiration for a handful of brave and
energetic women from developing countries; and filled with cynicism
about most of the women who had trekked to China from the west. The
former had many real causes to fight for; most of the latter were
indulging in the false belief that a cause called ``feminism''
still exists.
 &HT;    Like most women of my age and background, I grew up in the 1970s
taking feminism for granted. It was just a good cause like other
good causes, to be supported without much criticism. But I also
grew up without really understanding the nature of the revolution
which had already been carried out by previous generations of
women. I always assumed, for example, that I would grow up and get
a job. Everyone around me _ my parents and teachers _ assumed that
I would grow up and get a job too. This wasn't a matter of ``having
a career'' as an entertaining accompaniment to having a family. I
would have a job for the same kinds of reasons that the boys I knew
would have jobs: for financial security, professional satisfaction
and so on.
 &HT;    This was an assumption, not necessarily spoken aloud. But it was
supported by a series of legal changes _ some quite recent, some
dating back nearly a century: changes in property law, electoral
law, divorce law, education law and employment law. In my
generation, women had the same choices and faced the same
constraints as men. A good marriage was no longer the only form of
advancement.
 &HT;    This did not mean that women were the same as men. This meant
that women in the United States and parts of western Europe were
treated similarly to men by the legal system, as employers or
employees, voters, property-owners, drivers of cars, users of birth
control or purchasers of mortgages and health insurance. Not
everybody might be able to take advantage of this equality: Women
are limited by economics and by social constraints, just like men.
Nor did reality always match the letter of the law. Women were not
always able to achieve in practice what they could in theory, just
like men. But equality existed on the statute books, ready to serve
as the basis for legal challenges and complaints.
 &HT;    The most important battle had been won _ and the war itself was
over. It may have been fashionable, when I was growing up, to call
oneself a feminist. But it was pointless: Beyond legal equality,
there was little _ and there still is little _ that women's
politics can achieve.
 &HT;    Of course not everyone realized that this was the end. In the
1980s, the death of feminism had already become an established
excuse for public hand-wringing. There was talk of ``backlash'' and
the rise of an ``anti-woman'' right. Much of the argument in the
United States focused on the right to abortion, which had never, in
the past, been central to the women's movement.
 &HT;    Yet for all the appearance of falling interest and a reversal of
values, there was no more a need to mourn the ``death'' of feminism
than there was a need to mourn the passing of iron washing boards.
Feminism was finished because it was no longer necessary. By the
time I started working, most people seemed to understand this _
except for the small group of women who continued to call
themselves feminists.
 &HT;    I realize that it is unfair to categorize them. Modern feminists
differ, and not everyone who calls herself a feminist is even
political in the strictest sense. ``Feminists'' now include
environmentalists, activist Christians, networking businesswomen,
academics with a special interest in women writers and _ as we know
from a thousand parodies _ lesbian separatists. Many of these,
however, are women acting together in small groups in order to
pursue, perfectly reasonably, the special interests which they
happen to have in common.
 &HT;    Yet in addition to these various special interest groups, there
also exists a community of women who go on identifying themselves
as mainstream feminists, and continue to argue about what that
implies. Some of the more prominent are journalists; others teach
at universities; and still others are ordinary women who continue
to follow the debate and strive to apply feminist principles to
their own lives.
 &HT;    In general, they are easy to recognize because they continue to
operate more or less within the same paradigm that advocates of
women's rights operated within 40 years ago, a paradigm
suffragettes would have recognized too. Most perceive women as
economically and politically weaker than men; most assume that all
women are affected by this imbalance in more or less the same way;
most argue that this imbalance can be rectified, using the legal
system _ and that all change in this direction is necessarily
progressive.
 &HT;    Most, in other words, continue to behave as if the two great
legal revolutions of the early 20th century and the 1970s had not
taken place. They continue to portray women as if they were all
alike, and all victims: metaphoric victims of the fashion industry
or the market economy; literal victims of predatory bosses or
husbands; victims who are unable to fight back, who have no
self-esteem, who are unable to make use of existing laws to defend
themselves and thus need ``quotas'' and other privileges.
 &HT;    What seems particularly sad, however, is that modern feminists
seem, most of the time, uninterested in providing realistic answers
to the genuine dilemmas that women now face as the result of their
revolutionary change in status.
 &HT;    Legal equality and the mass movement of women into the workforce
have created a host of family crises. High rates of divorce, with
obvious consequences for children and the elderly, reflect the
stresses caused by this massive change, as well as the changing
balance of power between men and women. At the same time, legal
equality has not yet brought with it changes in male (and female)
attitudes which make it easy for women to work with men on equal
terms.
 &HT;    Many men still do not want to work for women, or even to hire
women _ and when they do, they retain fixed ideas of what women can
and cannot be promoted to do, or of how much they should be paid. A
deep dislike of working women often lurks beneath the surface of
even the most apparently enlightened of men.
 &HT;    I remember a conversation with a retired newspaper editor who
told me that his single biggest problem was the inconvenience
caused by women who took maternity leave. If that was a problem, I
replied, then he shouldn't really have hired any women at all. ``I
know,'' he sighed wistfully, ``but you're not allowed to say
that.''
 &HT;    No wonder many women are still tormented by insecurities about
their jobs, or are plagued by the feeling that they are unable to
balance the demands of children and careers. Yet for most of the
past 40 years, mainstream feminism has had little to say about
working women and families. Most of the time feminists have been
profoundly uninterested in the problems of motherhood _ and
husbands _ in general.
 &HT;    From Betty Friedan, whose main concern was to get housewives out
of the house, to Naomi Wolf, who advises women to network their way
into positions of power, most feminists (American feminists in
particular) have been more interested in what women can achieve on
their own, rather than with men.
 &HT;    Worse, the assumptions of mainstream feminism tend to obscure
the actual problems faced by actual women. Working women with
children, for example, are generally not victims, but rather people
struggling to find some way to balance a lot of different concerns.
Nevertheless, mainstream feminism persists in seeing them as
equally downtrodden and equally oppressed, even when the evidence
is otherwise. Certainly they are not victims of their husbands, who
are often worse-off.
 &HT;    One of the conclusions of a 1997 Demos survey of women, for
example, was that mothers and fathers now have far more in common _
in terms of attitudes, anxieties, politics _ than mothers and
single women. Likewise, working men and working women have more in
common than women who work and women who don't work. Women with the
money to hire nannies have different problems from women on
welfare. The study concluded that feminism was still necessary. I
conclude the opposite.
 &HT;    I also conclude that those who are interested in the economic
and social issues of these various groups would do much better to
detach themselves from feminism before trying to think about
solving them. The difficulties faced by female part-time workers
should be discussed in the context of part-time work, not of
feminism. The ways in which the tax system discriminates against
those who hire domestic help should be discussed in the context of
tax law, not of feminism. Even childcare issues are really linked
to other employment and benefit issues.
 &HT;    As for the persistence of various forms of male prejudice,
female insecurity and imbalances in relations between employees and
employers _ I can see no solution except the passage of time.
Government simply cannot force people to change their behavior,
however offensive. Short of importing squads of Political
Correctness thought police, there is no way to change attitudes
using the legal system. Yet this does not mean that nothing will
ever change _ things are changing, very quickly.
 &HT;    It is odd, in fact, how much feminists underestimate the impact
on attitudes which working women can have, simply by their presence
in the workplace. By doing their jobs well, women encourage men to
hire other women. By becoming managers, editors, chairmen and
foremen, women put themselves in a position to hire other women.
Through demonstrating competence and reliability, women already
find it easier than men to get certain kinds of factory and
clerical jobs.
 &HT;    Already, there are professions in which the presence of women is
actually required. In fact, there is no newspaper editor, anywhere,
who can afford not to have women writers.
 &HT;    In the meantime, women are not the only ones to be hired or
fired according to their looks or their background; it is not only
women who feel frustrated because they cannot achieve what they
want. It is not only women who are given an education too narrow to
help them in the real world; it is not only women who lack role
models or mentors. On the contrary _ 40 years ago, it was possible
to argue that women started their working lives in a worse position
than men. Now it is possible, in many parts of the world, to argue
the opposite.
 &HT;    I repeat: I know that there are different kinds of feminists.
But why is it that, when I close my eyes and think about the
western feminists whom I encountered en masse in Huairou, I want to
tell them to wake up, to look at what has already happened in the
world; to stop talking about me and the women I know as victims,
stop describing the men I know as oppressors, stop pretending that
nothing has happened over the past century?
 &HT;    The era of organized women's politics is over. Legal equality
has been achieved. Now we must revive some of the older values that
were lost in the process.
 &HT;    Feminism is dead, a victim of female success _ can we please now
stop mourning its demise.

world; to stop talking about me and the women I know as victims,
stop describing the men I know as oppressors, stop pretending that
nothing has happened over the past century?
 &HT;    The era of organized women's politics is over. Legal equality
has been achieved. Now we must revive some of the older values that
were lost in the process.
 &HT;    Feminism is dead, a victim of female success _ can we please now
stop mourning its demise.

 By MIKE WISE  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    As he stepped from a black stretch limousine in front of a
modest Milwaukee house in January, Dave Checketts, the president of
Madison Square Garden, knew a lot was riding on the interview he
was about to conduct.
 &HT;    Just how much, it would later turn out, he couldn't fully
understand.
 &HT;    Joined by Ernie Grunfeld, then the Knicks' president, their
coach, Jeff Van Gundy, and another team executive, Checketts was
there to gauge the character of Latrell Sprewell.
 &HT;    A three-time All-Star guard, Sprewell had been on furlough ever
since attacking his coach with the Golden State Warriors, P.J.
Carlesimo, the year before, choking him, threatening to kill him
and, 20 minutes later, returning to the gym to punch him.
 &HT;    Both Grunfeld and Van Gundy wanted Sprewell badly, but if
Checketts was going to gamble on the National Basketball
Association's most prominent pariah, he needed to know more, and
not just about Sprewell's celebrated assault but also about a
strange 1994 incident in which one of Sprewell's pit bulls bit off
the ear of his 4-year-old daughter.
 &HT;    Sprewell had refused to put the dog to sleep until the 10th and
final day of its quarantine and, when questioned by reporters, had
airily dismissed the episode, saying, ``Stuff happens.''
 &HT;    Checketts questioned Sprewell closely about the incident. ``I
have six kids, and I know how I feel about them,'' Checketts said
that day. ``And I don't expect everyone to feel for their kids the
way I feel for mine. But I have to get something off my chest and
ask, 'Why would you say that?'''
 &HT;    Sprewell answered the question in two parts, first picking up a
framed picture of his daughter and handing it to Checketts.
 &HT;    ``I love my daughter dearly,'' he said. ``I took care of her
plastic surgery, it didn't affect her hearing and I've never had
anything hurt me more in my life.''
 &HT;    He also had an explanation for the ``stuff happens'' remark. ``I
was tired of the press crawling all over me. I didn't want them to
go to the hospital.''
 &HT;    ``He was not indignant,'' Checketts said. ``He was not
defensive. I believed what he was telling me.''
 &HT;    Four months after that Jan. 17 visit, Checketts scans his memory
for something else that stood out, something else that persuaded
him to give Sprewell an opportunity to resume his career after a
13-month layoff, how a meeting barely lasting 90 minutes could
alter his perception.
 &HT;    ``I'd have to say, 'Footprints in the Sand,''' Checketts says,
recalling a familiar poem etched in a mirror inside the doorway of
Sprewell's home. It's about a deceased man looking back on his life
and remembering that there were always two sets of footprints in
the sand.
 &HT;    ``The man confronts the Lord about only remembering one set of
footprints in his deepest, darkest moments,'' Checketts says. ``'My
son,' the Lord replies, 'it was during those times I carried you.'
It was deeply personal for me at different points in my life.''
 &HT;    Staying behind for a few minutes as the rest of the Knick brain
trust shuffled back to the limousine, Checketts asked Sprewell,
``That's an appropriate verse for you, don't you think?''
 &HT;    Sprewell nodded.
 &HT;    ``Do you ever think about it?''
 &HT;    ``Oh, many, many times.''
 &HT;    ``Does it mean anything to you?''
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' Sprewell replied. ``I know I've been carried.''
 &HT;    Returning to his home in New Canaan, Conn., that night,
Checketts asked his family for advice. ``You know what kind of
stuff I would take at school if we got him, Dad?'' asked one of his
sons. ``Are we really going after him?''
 &HT;    Checketts also questioned his own values, wondering what
credibility he would have if he acquired Sprewell. (Checketts, a
Mormon who came to New York via Bountiful, Utah, had once said he
would never have Dennis Rodman on his team.)
 &HT;    His two youngest sons thought Sprewell deserved a second chance,
which got the other one thinking again. ``You think he could help
us win?'' His father nodded.
 &HT;    ``Look, I did not lead the family in prayer to ask God whether
we should take Latrell Sprewell,'' Checketts says. ``And it wasn't
like a light turned on in my head. But I felt I understood the man
a lot better. The visit we had with him convinced me it would
work.''
 -0- 
 &HT;    In basketball, before a big game, it is not uncommon to
experience ``butterflies.'' Your stomach churns and you hope your
surging adrenaline carries you those first few minutes until you
calm down and find symmetry and purpose in the way you play.
 &HT;    But as Knicks' fans, players and management have come to
understand, there is neither purpose nor symmetry in Sprewell's
game. It's more of an avant-garde jazz riff, played at high speed
and with little discernible logic. And for the Knicks' management
and coaches, the anxiety never goes away.
 &HT;    They tried to tap into Sprewell's psyche that January day but
forgot to ask whether he could cope with coming off the bench,
rather than playing with the starting team. They went in search of
personal character and walked right past team chemistry. Their goal
was a noble one _ to transform a good player on a bad team into a
great player on a championship team. They never imagined that that
player could take a good team and play a major role in turning it
into a very bad one.
 &HT;    But somewhere over the last few months, Sprewell managed that
feat, pulling the Knicks into his world _ an enigmatic one, in
which he gets his points, his team loses and everyone wonders why a
once-proud franchise is on the brink of missing the playoffs for
the first time in 12 years.
 &HT;    He stands in the middle of the chaos and uncertainty,
irredeemable after all _ but not for the reasons that Checketts and
the Knicks feared.
 &HT;    Sprewell, the player who has never seen a shot he didn't like,
who glowers at teammates when they don't pass him the ball, who
forgets defensive assignments at crucial moments, is actually more
harmful to a team than Sprewell the supposed human hand grenade in
high-tops.
 &HT;    ``Obviously, it hasn't worked out like everybody had hoped,'' he
says, sitting inside his locker cubicle after a recent loss to the
Toronto Raptors. ``Maybe I'll be here next season, but you never
know. Things change quickly in this league.''
 &HT;    Indeed. On April 21, the day Sprewell's agent complained
publicly that a rift between Grunfeld and Van Gundy was hurting the
team, Checketts dismissed Grunfeld and took over the team himself.
(One of his first acts was to fine Sprewell $25,000 for allowing
his agent to speak out.) And those are just the casualties off the
floor.
 &HT;    On the court, it is surreal to watch him go one-on-nine, using
his teammates and opponents as pylons. Surreal and sad. For
whatever redemptive qualities Sprewell has, they have yet to emerge
on the floor.
 &HT;    His talent can be mesmerizing. At Golden State, where Sprewell
established himself in some people's eyes as the second best
shooting guard in the league, behind Michael Jordan, his
explosiveness and production masked his liabilities.
 &HT;    He played defense with passion and fire. On offense, at a sinewy
6 feet 5 inches, he could dart through defenses, either getting to
the basket for a layup or stopping abruptly to nail a long jumper.
 &HT;    In a league enamored of great one-on-one players, he looked like
the real deal, the guy who could break down a defense
single-handedly. For the Knicks, who have a long history of looking
for (and never finding) that one great player to put alongside
Patrick Ewing and produce a championship, Sprewell seemed like the
answer.
 &HT;    Yet, had they looked closer, Knick officials might have noticed
disturbing signs. After one playoff season, in 1994, the Warriors
began to implode. Trades and losses mounted, and so did Sprewell's
frustration. He feuded and fought with teammates. A self-described
loner, he lost his senses on Dec. 1, 1997, an incident that
catapulted him into the role of America's Thug.
 &HT;    ``He fits the perpetrator to a 'T,''' says Spike Lee, sitting in
his courtside seat at the Garden, his No. 8 Sprewell jersey peaking
out from beneath his jacket. ``The corn rows. The scowl.
Everything. People would think he's another thug the NYPD has to
protect us from. What's interesting, though, is he's very
articulate.''
 &HT;    When you speak to Sprewell, you see no rage, no contempt for
authority. He is intelligent and engaging. But his comments and
actions, on the court and off, tend to confirm your worst thoughts
about him.
 &HT;    The laughing after losses. The failure to pass the ball to an
open man. And, particularly, those out-of-touch remarks.
 &HT;    In late March, for example, Van Gundy began to wonder seriously
whether Sprewell cared about winning.
 &HT;    On March 27, during a practice, the coach coolly called Sprewell
aside to talk about something he had said in a column I wrote the
night before. Van Gundy specifically mentioned a passage in which I
had asked Sprewell whether it bothered him that the Warriors and
Knicks were a combined 7-22 with him in the lineup over the last
two seasons.
 &HT;    Sprewell's response was: ``That's just one of those stats. That
doesn't bother me.''
 &HT;    Van Gundy questioned Sprewell on a vacant, dark stairwell as the
Knicks shot baskets and reporters anxiously hovered about 20 yards
away. If the concerned coach wanted a better answer, the nonchalant
player wanted to know why Van Gundy had made a power play in front
of the press.
 &HT;    ``I think if he had do it over again, I think he'd give a
different answer,'' Van Gundy said soon after. ``It's not a valid
stat? Every player has to be concerned first and foremost with
winning. That is going to be their legacy in this league. He would
probably like to have a do over on that.''
 &HT;    A few days later, I asked Sprewell if he would like to clarify
or add to that statement.
 &HT;    ``No, I said what I said and I meant it,'' he said. ``I didn't
think what I said was that big a deal. I don't know why Jeff had to
say anything to me about it. Basketball is supposed to be fun,
right?''
 &HT;    You get the sense that sometimes he just does not get it, that
the reason Sprewell is such a polarizing force has nothing to do
with a nasty disposition or a conscious desire for confrontation _
and everything to do with Spree-ality.
 &HT;    Conventional reality: You sacrifice to win.
 &HT;    Spree-ality: You balk at coming off the bench, rather than
starting, and make sure your agent informs the news media about the
grave injustice taking place.
 &HT;    Conventional reality: You put the choking incident behind you.
 &HT;    Spree-ality: Since, down deep, you feel you committed no crime,
you pursue a racially based lawsuit against the team and the league
_ a suit that a federal judge has twice rejected.
 &HT;    Conventional reality: You complete an anger-management course,
if for no other reason than to send the right message.
 &HT;    Spree-ality: You blow off the sessions, calling it all a joke
and insisting you don't have a problem.
 &HT;    One odd quirk about Sprewell is his penchant for gravitating to
the youngest players on the team. At Golden State, Sprewell, now
29, hung out with an impressionable rookie, Joe Smith, and the
young equipment manager, Shane Salazar. In New York, Marcus Camby,
25, and Rick Brunson, 26, became his frequent dinner companions.
 &HT;    From the beginning, Sprewell had trouble adjusting on the floor.
Yet never did he seem more out of place than the night of April 7
in Charlotte, N.C. Speaking before the game, he said: ``People have
written stuff, but I'm not bringing anybody down. I'm not making
other people play poorly. I don't know what I'm doing that's so
bad.
 &HT;    ``I mean, you know, at this point, they're not accustomed to
having seasons like this. Everybody has to come up with a reason
why we're playing badly. So, obviously, it's Latrell's fault.''
 &HT;    Hours later, after a 24-point drubbing by the moribund Charlotte
Hornets _ the Knicks' fifth loss in seven nights _ Ewing said he
could not recall a more depressing night in his 15-year Knick
career. Rumors of Van Gundy's demise crackled through the press
room.
 &HT;    Sprewell? He looked around and wondered why all the sad faces.
``Being in sixth place with 15 games left, that's a lot of time,''
he said, unaware that the Knicks were actually in 10th place. ``We
don't have a lot of time, but we have enough time to make a run
here. So I'm not throwing in the towel yet. I know we're down, but
we got to get over it. You can't stay down. That's the attitude I
have.''
 &HT;    When someone intoned, ``You seem kind of unfazed by all that's
taken place,'' Sprewell shrugged his shoulders.
 &HT;    ``I've played on losing teams before,'' he said. ``I know what
it takes. A lot of these guys haven't experienced times like this,
and I have. We can't think championship right now. I think we have
to take it game by game and think: 'Hey, let's get in. And let's
build on that.' I've said it before. I don't see the elite teams in
the East being that much better than us, especially when we're
playing well.''
 &HT;    Whatever his intention _ and no one seriously doubts his concern
for the team's fortunes _ Sprewell sounded like some wise old sage,
saying something to the effect of: ``I can lead you. We're on my
turf. We're losing. The unpromised land is near. Let me take you
there.''
 -0 
 &HT;    During a recent visit to Oakland, a player on last season's team
will show you where the incident took place, five floors above the
Oakland Convention Center, on the Warriors' practice floor. How
they traded words and, in a moment of fury, Sprewell grabbed
Carlesimo around the throat, changing his career forever.
 &HT;    And yet, after all the discussion about the altercation, you
forget it began with someone telling Sprewell what to do on a
basketball court. Unlike his previous coaches, who let Sprewell
freelance without conscience, Carlesimo wanted more team play.
Specifically, he wanted Sprewell to make better passes during a
drill.
 &HT;    He doesn't like living up to obligations imposed on him by
others. He has thrived whenever people let him do what he wanted to
do. It's as if, approaching 30, he is still in his Terrible Twos.
Sprewell lives and plays in his own universe, undermining structure
and reason.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The campus of the University of California at Berkeley in
springtime is about as close to Shangri-La as most mortals are
likely to get.
 &HT;    When I paid a visit in April, the dogwoods and the cherry trees
were in splendid bloom and the broad, sunny plaza in front of the
Mario Savio Steps at Sproul Hall was jammed with students.
 &HT;    I had arrived during campaign season, and kids were milling
around the plaza holding placards and bedsheets promising better,
wiser, bolder student government. Berkeley must be one of the few
universities with standing political parties, and several of the
parties had set up booths. One of the loneliest of them, never
staffed by more than a student or two, belonged to the Defend
Affirmative Action Party.
 &HT;    A year earlier, when the ban on the use of affirmative action
enacted by the Board of Regents and confirmed by voters in
Proposition 209 went into effect, freshman minority enrollment at
Berkeley had been cut by half. Conservatives had got their wish,
but it had led to precisely the disaster predicted by affirmative
action's backers. It wouldn't have been surprising, then, if
preferences were a roaring issue on campus.
 &HT;    I asked a student if the Defend Affirmative Action Party had a
chance of winning a seat in this spring's elections in the student
government. He consulted a friend. ``Not really,'' he said. A poll
taken at the time of Proposition 209 showed that in fact most
students opposed affirmative action.
 &HT;    Across the plaza one of the most popular parties, Calserve, was
handing out fliers urging students to vote yes on Proposition 3,
which, by contrast, was considered a shoo-in. It called for a $3
hike in student fees to support outreach efforts to increase the
flow of minority students from local high schools.
 &HT;    Berkeley students, in turns out, are like most Americans. They
want diversity without the zero-sum calculus that inevitably
accompanies affirmative action.
 &HT;    Ending affirmative action on campus has had fewer nightmarish
effects in California than you might have thought from the initial
returns.
 &HT;    Many, though scarcely all, of the minority students who didn't
get in to Berkeley or UCLA the first year after Proposition 209 was
passed enrolled instead at one of the less selective UC campuses,
including Irvine, Santa Cruz and Riverside _ a phenomenon known in
the affirmative-action world as ``cascading.''
 &HT;    What's more, thanks to some deft fiddling with admissions
criteria, Berkeley found that the zero-sum calculus was not quite
as inexorable as it seemed. In early April, the admissions office
announced that Berkeley had admitted 30 percent more minority
students than it had the year before. Apparently it takes a year to
get the fiddling right, since Boalt Hall, Berkeley's law school,
experienced a comparable jump in its second post-preference
entering class as well.
 &HT;    Finally, ending affirmative action has had one unpublicized and
profoundly desirable consequence. It has forced the university to
try to expand the pool of eligible minority students. Outreach
programs such as the one underwritten by Proposition 3 have
proliferated. The State Legislature authorized $38.5 million for
outreach efforts last year and has required the public schools to
spend an additional $31 million on similar initiatives.
 &HT;    UC campuses are now reaching down into the high schools, the
junior highs and even the elementary schools to help minority
students achieve the kind of academic record that will make them
eligible for admission, thus raising the possibility that diversity
without preferences will someday prove to be more than a fond hope.
 &HT;    Academics and administrators throughout the system admit that
the university would never have shouldered this burden had it not
been for the elimination of affirmative action. Many say that the
price is worth paying. As Saul Geiser, head of student academic
services for the UC system, says: ``California has brought this
whole new thing to the country with Proposition 209. Maybe we can
be the ones who begin to show what's on the other side.''
 &HT;    What's on the other side is not so much a coherent alternative
as it is a series of impromptu adaptations _ which may frustrate
ideologues on both sides of the debate. Liberals think that
cascading represents a terrible denial of opportunity, and
conservatives think that fiddling undermines the principle of
merit. The question is whether the new dispensation is preferable
to the old one. The answer is yes.
 &HT;    Indeed, the essential function of affirmative action in
California has been to redistribute minority students from the
bottom to the top of the UC ladder. As increasing numbers of
high-school graduates have trained their sights on Berkeley and
UCLA, the UC system has developed a meritocratic ladder. The
campuses at the bottom, including Santa Cruz and Riverside, accept
all UC-eligible students, but only the top 4 percent of the state's
students makes it into Berkeley or UCLA. Not many Latinos, and a
minuscule number of blacks, are among them.
 &HT;    Until recently, Berkeley's gain has been Riverside's loss. Now
it's working the other way around. One way to think about the
consequences of ending affirmative action is to ask: How bad is it
to go to Riverside?
 &HT;    I asked Kenya Coleman, a black student who was majoring in
business, whether she felt that students denied admission to
Berkeley would be losing out. She bristled slightly and said, ``If
they end up here it would be a blessing in disguise.''
 &HT;    Coleman had in fact been accepted at UCLA, but had elected to
come to Riverside. Another student, Ricardo Vargas, was just as
loyal to the campus and even less inclined to give lip service to
affirmative action.
 &HT;    Vargas said that his parents had been farmers in Mexico. ``I
grew up in a poor family,'' he said. ``My parents instilled in me
the fact that education is the only way to succeed. If I can burn
the midnight oil and work hard, I don't see why everyone else
can't.''
 &HT;    At Riverside virtually every student I talked to remarked on
what a welcoming place it was. Black students, who report feeling
uncomfortable or beleaguered on many campuses, brought this up
again and again.
 &HT;    ``I think I am more prepared in terms of graduate school than I
would have been if I had gone to UCLA,'' said Bert Wright Jr., a
senior. ``Some of the professors there are not necessarily as
humble as they are here.''
 &HT;    The accepted wisdom on campus was that UCLA was so big and
overcrowded and the professors so unapproachable that students
rarely had a chance to speak to their instructors and often had to
wait a semester or two to take the courses they wanted.
 &HT;    A surprising number of students, like Wright or Coleman, had
gotten into fancier schools but chose to enroll at Riverside, and
none of them had come to regret it. A black student named Mark
Thomas told me that he had been accepted at UCLA, Berkeley, Yale
and Princeton, but that he had chosen Riverside because it was much
cheaper than the Ivy Leagues and had offered scholarship money
unavailable at the other UC schools.
 &HT;    I spoke to only a few freshmen who felt bitter about ending up
at Riverside after failing to gain admission to UCLA or Berkeley.
Many of the minority students I met were involved in the school's
innumerable outreach programs. Indeed, one reason scarcely anyone
could get agitated about affirmative action was that Riverside has
an active sense of social mission that made the whole issue of
preferences seem almost irrelevant.
 &HT;    The pipeline-expanding idea that is novel elsewhere in the
system has been close to the core of Riverside's identity
throughout this decade. When a physicist named Raymond Orbach was
appointed chancellor in 1992, he realized that the key to growth
was to recruit more of the Asian, Chicano and black students from
the surrounding region.
 &HT;    Riverside and the neighboring San Bernardino counties are among
the poorest regions in California served by a UC campus; in 1990,
only 6 percent of graduates in the area were UC-eligible. Orbach
made it a universitywide mission to increase the supply of eligible
students through recruitment as well as academic coaching.
 &HT;    Between 1990 and 1996, the fraction of UC-eligible students
declined in almost every region of California; in Riverside and San
Bernardino counties, the figure rose from 6 percent to 8.1 percent.
 &HT;    What is striking is the extent to which Riverside, a relatively
humble and pragmatic institution, has begun to reshape itself
around the mission of expanding the pool of eligible minority
students. A signal is being sent that outreach is an academic _ not
merely a public-relations _ function of the university.
 &HT;    Despite Orbach's extraordinary success in expanding minority
enrollment, it is he who wrote the position paper in which all the
chancellors in the UC system laid out their objections to the
regents' anti-affirmative action policies.
 &HT;    Orbach made a point of telling me, ``I don't want this to be
perceived as somehow a replacement for affirmative action.'' He is
not convinced that what has worked for Riverside will work at the
much higher level of selectivity required to bring minority
students to Berkeley.
 &HT;    Indeed, in California and in Texas, where a 1996 court decision,
Hopwood vs. Texas, prohibited the use of affirmative action in
higher education, the end of racial preferences is widely seen as
the harbinger of a tremendous catastrophe for minority students.
Jerome Karabel, a Berkeley scholar and a leading authority on
affirmative action, calls the rollback ``the biggest negative
redistribution of educational opportunity in the history of the
country.''
 &HT;    Technically, that may be true. But the sky-is-falling position
assumes both that elite institutions will not have significant
minority representation without preferences and that students who
descend a tier in educational prestige will suffer a devastating
loss. And both those assumptions seem hyperbolic.
 &HT;    There's no question that what began in Texas and California is
now moving on to other states. An organization called the Center
for Individual Rights, working through local plaintiffs, has filed
two lawsuits, which are expected to be heard in the late summer or
fall, against the University of Michigan and its law school, as
well as another against the University of Washington Law School.
 &HT;    Any public institution practicing affirmative action is
potentially subject to 14th Amendment due-process claims, and
because most law schools and medical schools, and about the upper
fifth of undergraduate institutions, practice affirmative action to
a significant degree, similar lawsuits can be filed in many other
states and almost certainly will be if the plaintiffs win in any of
the current cases.
 &HT;    Yet, even if the plaintiffs in these cases prevail,
``redistribution'' will probably not become widespread. Terence
Pell, the senior counsel at the Center for Individual Rights,
points out that only 6 of the 74 colleges, universities and
graduate programs in California and Texas suffered from a loss of
minority students in the first year. Even at those six, minority
enrollment increased in the second year.
 &HT;    At the University of Texas, it dropped only slightly after
Hopwood went into effect. ``I don't think we can conclude that it's
impossible for even the flagship schools to get the numbers where
they were before the use of preferences,'' Pell says. In fact, the
Texas experience will probably be the norm for most public
universities, since few are as selective as Berkeley.
 &HT;    At the graduate-school level, however, even the cheery Pell
concedes that ``it's going to take a few years'' before the
fraction of minority students at the most desirable graduate
schools _ including Boalt and the University of Texas Law School _
return to affirmative-action levels.
 &HT;    And as Karabel observes, more than half the applicants in any
given year are not accepted into any medical school. And so,
without affirmative action, many minority students may not be able
to attend medical school at all.
 &HT;    What about those who do cascade downward _ what kind of harms
will they suffer? None, say many conservatives. Stephan and Abigail
Thernstrom, authors of ``America in Black and White,'' write that
historically black colleges produce more black engineers and
doctors than all of the Ivies and the other great universities.
 &HT;    According to another scholar, Martin Trow, an emeritus professor
at Berkeley and a prominent critic of affirmative action, ``The
notion that you have to go to one of the most selective
universities to fulfill your potential, or to become a leader in
America, betrays an elitist conception of American life.'' He wrote
this in a critique of ``The Shape of the River,'' a
pro-affirmative-action classic by the former presidents of Harvard
and Princeton, Derek Bok and William Bowen.
 &HT;    Conservatives have consistently argued that affirmative action
does not benefit its beneficiaries. The Thernstroms write that
black students are likelier to succeed academically, and to
graduate, at institutions for which they are qualified than at
those to which they have been granted special access.
 &HT;    Yet this view is overdrawn, as a comparison of Berkeley and
Riverside makes clear. Indeed, the Thernstroms make great use of
Berkeley, where until recently the black graduation rate was only
60 percent. By 1998, however, the graduation rate was up to 71
percent for black students and 78 percent for Latinos.
 &HT;    At Riverside, the graduation rate for the entire class was only
68 percent. For blacks it was just 60 percent. You'd think that
rigorous schools would have higher dropout rates, but in fact the
opposite is true.
 &HT;    As Bok and Bowen observe, in the sample of 28 elite schools they
studied, ``even those black students in the lowest SAT band (those
with combined scores under 1,000) graduated at higher rates, the
more selective the school they attended.'' The elites, in short,
protect their own.
 &HT;    Many of the minority students I met at Berkeley had been stunned
by how hard the work was and had thrashed around unhappily for a
while.
 &HT;    ``It took me about three semesters to learn everything,'' said
Susana Morales, admitting that at first she had been overwhelmed at
Berkeley. ``I had to learn how to read critically. I had to learn
how to think critically. I had to learn how to study critically.
It's still very hard for me to compete.''
 &HT;    But you could also argue that students such as Morales profit
more from the challenge than do their more blase classmates.
Morales, who is hoping to pursue a Ph.D. in cultural psychology,
said that Berkeley ``was everything I expected.'' She had been
thrilled to discover that her professors were part of larger
intellectual currents she had never recognized before.
 &HT;    ``In my class on drugs and the brain,'' she said, ``every day I
would go home and read an article that was parallel to what the
professor was saying.''
 &HT;    And if Morales had gone to Riverside? In all likelihood, she
would have been quite happy, as most of the minority students I met
there were, and she would have gone on to a productive, successful
life _ but at a somewhat lower trajectory. A large fraction of the
female students I spoke to at Riverside, minority as well as
nonminority, planned on a career as teachers _ a very modest
ambition compared with pursuing a Ph.D. in cultural psychology.
 &HT;    What, then, is at stake in affirmative action? It is certainly
not true, as you sometimes hear, that the black or Hispanic middle
class depends on affirmative action for its survival and growth.
Only about 20 percent of the nation's colleges _ the prestigious
ones that everyone has heard of _ even use preferences to a
significant degree.
 &HT;    The vast majority of four-year institutions admit all or almost
all of the students who apply. Most important, the number of blacks
enrolling in college has continued to rise. They now constitute 11
percent of the college-going population, up from 8.8 percent in
1985.
 &HT;    What's at stake is not a place in the middle class, but a place
in the elite _ in the famous universities and graduate schools and
in the law firms and banks and foundations and so on that lie at
the apogee of the culture and that offer the big rewards.
 &HT;    Another way of putting it is that affirmative action permits
minority students to compress their climb up the ladder of social
mobility by a generation or so and thus speeds their assimilation
into the larger culture.
 &HT;    This is hardly a good to be dismissed. On the other hand, it is
a good that one would very much prefer to see accomplished without
recourse to racial preferences.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The campus of the University of California at Berkeley in
springtime is about as close to Shangri-La as most mortals are
likely to get.
 &HT;    When I paid a visit in April, the dogwoods and the cherry trees
were in splendid bloom and the broad, sunny plaza in front of the
Mario Savio Steps at Sproul Hall was jammed with students.
 &HT;    I had arrived during campaign season, and kids were milling
around the plaza holding placards and bedsheets promising better,
wiser, bolder student government. Berkeley must be one of the few
universities with standing political parties, and several of the
parties had set up booths. One of the loneliest of them, never
staffed by more than a student or two, belonged to the Defend
Affirmative Action Party.
 &HT;    A year earlier, when the ban on the use of affirmative action
enacted by the Board of Regents and confirmed by voters in
Proposition 209 went into effect, freshman minority enrollment at
Berkeley had been cut by half. Conservatives had got their wish,
but it had led to precisely the disaster predicted by affirmative
action's backers. It wouldn't have been surprising, then, if
preferences were a roaring issue on campus.
 &HT;    I asked a student if the Defend Affirmative Action Party had a
chance of winning a seat in this spring's elections in the student
government. He consulted a friend. ``Not really,'' he said. A poll
taken at the time of Proposition 209 showed that in fact most
students opposed affirmative action.
 &HT;    Across the plaza one of the most popular parties, Calserve, was
handing out fliers urging students to vote yes on Proposition 3,
which, by contrast, was considered a shoo-in. It called for a $3
hike in student fees to support outreach efforts to increase the
flow of minority students from local high schools.
 &HT;    Berkeley students, in turns out, are like most Americans. They
want diversity without the zero-sum calculus that inevitably
accompanies affirmative action.
 &HT;    Ending affirmative action on campus has had fewer nightmarish
effects in California than you might have thought from the initial
returns.
 &HT;    Many, though scarcely all, of the minority students who didn't
get in to Berkeley or UCLA the first year after Proposition 209 was
passed enrolled instead at one of the less selective UC campuses,
including Irvine, Santa Cruz and Riverside _ a phenomenon known in
the affirmative-action world as ``cascading.''
 &HT;    What's more, thanks to some deft fiddling with admissions
criteria, Berkeley found that the zero-sum calculus was not quite
as inexorable as it seemed. In early April, the admissions office
announced that Berkeley had admitted 30 percent more minority
students than it had the year before. Apparently it takes a year to
get the fiddling right, since Boalt Hall, Berkeley's law school,
experienced a comparable jump in its second post-preference
entering class as well.
 &HT;    Finally, ending affirmative action has had one unpublicized and
profoundly desirable consequence. It has forced the university to
try to expand the pool of eligible minority students. Outreach
programs such as the one underwritten by Proposition 3 have
proliferated. The State Legislature authorized $38.5 million for
outreach efforts last year and has required the public schools to
spend an additional $31 million on similar initiatives.
 &HT;    UC campuses are now reaching down into the high schools, the
junior highs and even the elementary schools to help minority
students achieve the kind of academic record that will make them
eligible for admission, thus raising the possibility that diversity
without preferences will someday prove to be more than a fond hope.
 &HT;    Academics and administrators throughout the system admit that
the university would never have shouldered this burden had it not
been for the elimination of affirmative action. Many say that the
price is worth paying. As Saul Geiser, head of student academic
services for the UC system, says: ``California has brought this
whole new thing to the country with Proposition 209. Maybe we can
be the ones who begin to show what's on the other side.''
 &HT;    What's on the other side is not so much a coherent alternative
as it is a series of impromptu adaptations _ which may frustrate
ideologues on both sides of the debate. Liberals think that
cascading represents a terrible denial of opportunity, and
conservatives think that fiddling undermines the principle of
merit. The question is whether the new dispensation is preferable
to the old one. The answer is yes.
 &HT;    Indeed, the essential function of affirmative action in
California has been to redistribute minority students from the
bottom to the top of the UC ladder. As increasing numbers of
high-school graduates have trained their sights on Berkeley and
UCLA, the UC system has developed a meritocratic ladder. The
campuses at the bottom, including Santa Cruz and Riverside, accept
all UC-eligible students, but only the top 4 percent of the state's
students makes it into Berkeley or UCLA. Not many Latinos, and a
minuscule number of blacks, are among them.
 &HT;    Until recently, Berkeley's gain has been Riverside's loss. Now
it's working the other way around. One way to think about the
consequences of ending affirmative action is to ask: How bad is it
to go to Riverside?
 &HT;    I asked Kenya Coleman, a black student who was majoring in
business, whether she felt that students denied admission to
Berkeley would be losing out. She bristled slightly and said, ``If
they end up here it would be a blessing in disguise.''
 &HT;    Coleman had in fact been accepted at UCLA, but had elected to
come to Riverside. Another student, Ricardo Vargas, was just as
loyal to the campus and even less inclined to give lip service to
affirmative action.
 &HT;    Vargas said that his parents had been farmers in Mexico. ``I
grew up in a poor family,'' he said. ``My parents instilled in me
the fact that education is the only way to succeed. If I can burn
the midnight oil and work hard, I don't see why everyone else
can't.''
 &HT;    At Riverside virtually every student I talked to remarked on
what a welcoming place it was. Black students, who report feeling
uncomfortable or beleaguered on many campuses, brought this up
again and again.
 &HT;    ``I think I am more prepared in terms of graduate school than I
would have been if I had gone to UCLA,'' said Bert Wright Jr., a
senior. ``Some of the professors there are not necessarily as
humble as they are here.''
 &HT;    The accepted wisdom on campus was that UCLA was so big and
overcrowded and the professors so unapproachable that students
rarely had a chance to speak to their instructors and often had to
wait a semester or two to take the courses they wanted.
 &HT;    A surprising number of students, like Wright or Coleman, had
gotten into fancier schools but chose to enroll at Riverside, and
none of them had come to regret it. A black student named Mark
Thomas told me that he had been accepted at UCLA, Berkeley, Yale
and Princeton, but that he had chosen Riverside because it was much
cheaper than the Ivy Leagues and had offered scholarship money
unavailable at the other UC schools.
 &HT;    I spoke to only a few freshmen who felt bitter about ending up
at Riverside after failing to gain admission to UCLA or Berkeley.
Many of the minority students I met were involved in the school's
innumerable outreach programs. Indeed, one reason scarcely anyone
could get agitated about affirmative action was that Riverside has
an active sense of social mission that made the whole issue of
preferences seem almost irrelevant.
 &HT;    The pipeline-expanding idea that is novel elsewhere in the
system has been close to the core of Riverside's identity
throughout this decade. When a physicist named Raymond Orbach was
appointed chancellor in 1992, he realized that the key to growth
was to recruit more of the Asian, Chicano and black students from
the surrounding region.
 &HT;    Riverside and the neighboring San Bernardino counties are among
the poorest regions in California served by a UC campus; in 1990,
only 6 percent of graduates in the area were UC-eligible. Orbach
made it a universitywide mission to increase the supply of eligible
students through recruitment as well as academic coaching.
 &HT;    Between 1990 and 1996, the fraction of UC-eligible students
declined in almost every region of California; in Riverside and San
Bernardino counties, the figure rose from 6 percent to 8.1 percent.
 &HT;    What is striking is the extent to which Riverside, a relatively
humble and pragmatic institution, has begun to reshape itself
around the mission of expanding the pool of eligible minority
students. A signal is being sent that outreach is an academic _ not
merely a public-relations _ function of the university.
 &HT;    Despite Orbach's extraordinary success in expanding minority
enrollment, it is he who wrote the position paper in which all the
chancellors in the UC system laid out their objections to the
regents' anti-affirmative action policies.
 &HT;    Orbach made a point of telling me, ``I don't want this to be
perceived as somehow a replacement for affirmative action.'' He is
not convinced that what has worked for Riverside will work at the
much higher level of selectivity required to bring minority
students to Berkeley.
 &HT;    Indeed, in California and in Texas, where a 1996 court decision,
Hopwood vs. Texas, prohibited the use of affirmative action in
higher education, the end of racial preferences is widely seen as
the harbinger of a tremendous catastrophe for minority students.
Jerome Karabel, a Berkeley scholar and a leading authority on
affirmative action, calls the rollback ``the biggest negative
redistribution of educational opportunity in the history of the
country.''
 &HT;    Technically, that may be true. But the sky-is-falling position
assumes both that elite institutions will not have significant
minority representation without preferences and that students who
descend a tier in educational prestige will suffer a devastating
loss. And both those assumptions seem hyperbolic.
 &HT;    There's no question that what began in Texas and California is
now moving on to other states. An organization called the Center
for Individual Rights, working through local plaintiffs, has filed
two lawsuits, which are expected to be heard in the late summer or
fall, against the University of Michigan and its law school, as
well as another against the University of Washington Law School.
 &HT;    Any public institution practicing affirmative action is
potentially subject to 14th Amendment due-process claims, and
because most law schools and medical schools, and about the upper
fifth of undergraduate institutions, practice affirmative action to
a significant degree, similar lawsuits can be filed in many other
states and almost certainly will be if the plaintiffs win in any of
the current cases.
 &HT;    Yet, even if the plaintiffs in these cases prevail,
``redistribution'' will probably not become widespread. Terence
Pell, the senior counsel at the Center for Individual Rights,
points out that only 6 of the 74 colleges, universities and
graduate programs in California and Texas suffered from a loss of
minority students in the first year. Even at those six, minority
enrollment increased in the second year.
 &HT;    At the University of Texas, it dropped only slightly after
Hopwood went into effect. ``I don't think we can conclude that it's
impossible for even the flagship schools to get the numbers where
they were before the use of preferences,'' Pell says. In fact, the
Texas experience will probably be the norm for most public
universities, since few are as selective as Berkeley.
 &HT;    At the graduate-school level, however, even the cheery Pell
concedes that ``it's going to take a few years'' before the
fraction of minority students at the most desirable graduate
schools _ including Boalt and the University of Texas Law School _
return to affirmative-action levels.
 &HT;    And as Karabel observes, more than half the applicants in any
given year are not accepted into any medical school. And so,
without affirmative action, many minority students may not be able
to attend medical school at all.
 &HT;    What about those who do cascade downward _ what kind of harms
will they suffer? None, say many conservatives. Stephan and Abigail
Thernstrom, authors of ``America in Black and White,'' write that
historically black colleges produce more black engineers and
doctors than all of the Ivies and the other great universities.
 &HT;    According to another scholar, Martin Trow, an emeritus professor

America, betrays an elitist conception of American life.'' He wrote

   There are men who are similar to cities; like Baudelaire and
Marcel Proust to Paris, or Charles Dickens to London; there are
cities that really do exist, but which are, above all, literary
cities such as the Dublin that James Joyce narrated in ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are countries that can be reflected in cities which at
first sight have nothing to do with them. You place the city in
front of a mirror and suddenly the country just appears. That's
what happens with Austin, the capital of Texas. In a secret,
subliminal sort of way, that city is Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity probably began in September 1961, when Jorge Luis
Borges was invited by the University of Texas to give a poetry
seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buenos Aires in 1899, Borges found Austin in the
pre-high-tech industry days. The city had a pleasant atmosphere and
its most prominent architectural structure was probably the (now
restored) provincial Capitol Building dome. Borges was surprised by
the vast prairies that smelled of siestas and grilled meat, the
puddles, the stray dogs, all of which he thought inappropriate for
what he had imagined to be the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he thought it strange that butchers and trench diggers
knew how to speak English. ``I always,'' he tells us in his
autobiography, ``thought that English was a language denied to that
class of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, students would see him walking on Guadalupe
Street, arm in arm with a haughty woman, thought to be his wife:
``Mrs. Borges.'' Actually she was his widowed mother, Leonor
Acevedo, who at age 85 looked 60. As Borges became progressively
blind in his later years, she was frequently his travel companion
and read to him aloud.
</P>
<P>
   One employee at the Benson Library, amid the rare books, says
she still remembers them immersed in reading Alfonso Reyes' and
Atilio Chiappori's manuscripts. ``She,'' the librarian states,
``would help him with the reading, whispering at his ear in a very
hushed tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges' mom surpassed him in agility, energy and passion for
life. One morning they stopped at the library windows and observed
some original editions of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the fiery
17th-century Mexican poet, along with her handwritten documents.
The mother stubbornly insisted on taking a closer look. Sor Juana,
revered as a feminist, had chosen for 30 years to be a nun, the
only station in which a woman then was allowed to read and write.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript, partially blurred and discolored, was a page
torn out of a book of confessions of the Convent of San Jeronimo,
in which Sor Juana asks forgiveness for her sins and signs in
blood: ``I, the worst in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that the blood strokes had almost vanished with the
passage of time, while the rest of the writing remained intact,
Borges' mother later observed: ``This definitely proves what
`Georgie' always said. Blood is thinner than ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Austin, Borges had managed to scandalize a group
of American admirers with an array of politically incorrect
opinions _ on blacks, Texas music (a mix of ``country'' and
``mariachi'') and the usurpation of Mexican lands by Texas and
California, which he considered a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't there for the arrival of the bats. Austin is traversed
by the lazy Colorado River, which flows southward into the Gulf of
Mexico. The swampy surrounding lands were perfect breeding grounds
for mosquitoes. About 100,000 bats had migrated from Mexico and
settled under the Congress Avenue Bridge, whose concrete rafters
formed recesses like the niches of a honeycomb. When the cold
season came, the bats left, but they returned the following May,
reaching more than 200,000-strong, and because the females were
impregnated, the population soon doubled.
</P>
<P>
   By now the bats have become Austin's symbol; each day they
devour tons of mosquitoes and keep the air clean. At night, when
one nears the bridge, the harsh smell of the bat colonies clustered
there and their incessant shrieks are enough to drill through your
senses and your brain.
</P>
<P>
   A local group, Friends of the Bats, recently tried with no luck
to acquire manuscripts in which Borges wrote about Austin to
anthologize for this year's celebration of the Borges' centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I attended one of the university's anniversary
celebrations. I was escorted to the modest student residence where
Borges first roamed as well as to the proud Victorian hotel where
he lodged later. My guide was another survivor of those times,
Professor Carter Wheelock, whose Spanish was so clear and
unadulterated that nobody would guess he had learned it.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelock also has a Borgean memory: He can recite 3,183 verses
from Beowolf, the famous Anglo-Saxon poem, with the same courteous,
unassuming intonation that he picked up from Borges decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   The professor told me that Borges and his mother arrived in
Austin on Sept. 7, 1961, on a plane from Miami. Six or seven
colleagues had gone to meet him, but Borges was not there. Five
days later, when they were just about to file a police missing
person's report, Borges and his mother arrived at the university,
elated. They had decided to take a bus trip through the Deep South:
Tallahassee, Biloxi, New Orleans, Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Borges,'' Wheelock continued, ``wanted to smell what he
couldn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the prairies of Austin, where almost nothing ever occurs,
everything seemed to happen to Borges. In July 1966, a bit before
one of his trips, a mentally disturbed college junior named Charles
Whitman, 24, had killed his wife and mother and then secured
himself, with a cache of rifles and shotguns, in the 27-story
university clocktower. For an hour, he shot at passers-by.
</P>
<P>
   A precise, telescopic police sniper eventually took Whitman out,
but not before he had hit 46 people and killed 16. When Borges
returned the following spring, on his way from Harvard, he asked
Wheelock to take him to the tower and show him where Whitman had
died. They climbed 27 floors and came to the small wooden balcony,
where the shadow of blood still remained.
</P>
<P>
   Borges bent over, just like his character in ``The Aleph,'' and
remained silent for several long minutes, his imagination fixed on
some spot in the universe _ ``a point which only he could see,'' as
Wheelock puts it _ and then asked to be helped down.
</P>
<P>
   On the descent, which was slower than the climb up, Borges said
nothing. He didn't speak for the entire afternoon, night or the
next day _ Borges, whose fiction was so well able to encapsulate
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   A country is not only its geography and history, or its everyday
tragedies and celebrations; a country is not only its politicians.
It is also (and sometimes above all), its memory. Santiago de Chile
was the Argentina of 1845, when Sarmiento was there and wrote
``Facundo''; and Paris was the Argentina of 1962, when Cortazar
wrote ``Facundo''; and Paris was the Argentina of 1962, when
Cortazar wrote ``Rayuela'' on the same sheets of paper that are now
in the Benson Library.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is also Argentina, yesterday and today; you can still see
Borges on Guadelupe Street, taking a stroll with his blind-man's
walking stick and reciting Beowulf, while the newly arrived
immigrants dig ditches, except that now they no longer speak
English. The language they speak is a Spanish that Borges may not
even understand.

<P>
   There are men who are similar to cities; like Baudelaire and
Marcel Proust to Paris, or Charles Dickens to London; there are
cities that really do exist, but which are, above all, literary
cities such as the Dublin that James Joyce narrated in ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are countries that can be reflected in cities which at
first sight have nothing to do with them. You place the city in
front of a mirror and suddenly the country just appears. That's
what happens with Austin, the capital of Texas. In a secret,
subliminal sort of way, that city is Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The similarity probably began in September 1961, when Jorge Luis
Borges was invited by the University of Texas to give a poetry
seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Buenos Aires in 1899, Borges found Austin in the
pre-high-tech industry days. The city had a pleasant atmosphere and
its most prominent architectural structure was probably the (now
restored) provincial Capitol Building dome. Borges was surprised by
the vast prairies that smelled of siestas and grilled meat, the
puddles, the stray dogs, all of which he thought inappropriate for
what he had imagined to be the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he thought it strange that butchers and trench diggers
knew how to speak English. ``I always,'' he tells us in his
autobiography, ``thought that English was a language denied to that
class of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, students would see him walking on Guadalupe
Street, arm in arm with a haughty woman, thought to be his wife:
``Mrs. Borges.'' Actually she was his widowed mother, Leonor
Acevedo, who at age 85 looked 60. As Borges became progressively
blind in his later years, she was frequently his travel companion
and read to him aloud.
</P>
<P>
   One employee at the Benson Library, amid the rare books, says
she still remembers them immersed in reading Alfonso Reyes' and
Atilio Chiappori's manuscripts. ``She,'' the librarian states,
``would help him with the reading, whispering at his ear in a very
hushed tone.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges' mom surpassed him in agility, energy and passion for
life. One morning they stopped at the library windows and observed
some original editions of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, the fiery
17th-century Mexican poet, along with her handwritten documents.
The mother stubbornly insisted on taking a closer look. Sor Juana,
revered as a feminist, had chosen for 30 years to be a nun, the
only station in which a woman then was allowed to read and write.
</P>
<P>
   The manuscript, partially blurred and discolored, was a page
torn out of a book of confessions of the Convent of San Jeronimo,
in which Sor Juana asks forgiveness for her sins and signs in
blood: ``I, the worst in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that the blood strokes had almost vanished with the
passage of time, while the rest of the writing remained intact,
Borges' mother later observed: ``This definitely proves what
`Georgie' always said. Blood is thinner than ink.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Austin, Borges had managed to scandalize a group
of American admirers with an array of politically incorrect
opinions _ on blacks, Texas music (a mix of ``country'' and
``mariachi'') and the usurpation of Mexican lands by Texas and
California, which he considered a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't there for the arrival of the bats. Austin is traversed
by the lazy Colorado River, which flows southward into the Gulf of
Mexico. The swampy surrounding lands were perfect breeding grounds
for mosquitoes. About 100,000 bats had migrated from Mexico and
settled under the Congress Avenue Bridge, whose concrete rafters
formed recesses like the niches of a honeycomb. When the cold
season came, the bats left, but they returned the following May,
reaching more than 200,000-strong, and because the females were
impregnated, the population soon doubled.
</P>
<P>
   By now the bats have become Austin's symbol; each day they
devour tons of mosquitoes and keep the air clean. At night, when
one nears the bridge, the harsh smell of the bat colonies clustered
there and their incessant shrieks are enough to drill through your
senses and your brain.
</P>
<P>
   A local group, Friends of the Bats, recently tried with no luck
to acquire manuscripts in which Borges wrote about Austin to
anthologize for this year's celebration of the Borges' centennial.
</P>
<P>
   Recently I attended one of the university's anniversary
celebrations. I was escorted to the modest student residence where
Borges first roamed as well as to the proud Victorian hotel where
he lodged later. My guide was another survivor of those times,
Professor Carter Wheelock, whose Spanish was so clear and
unadulterated that nobody would guess he had learned it.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelock also has a Borgean memory: He can recite 3,183 verses
from Beowolf, the famous Anglo-Saxon poem, with the same courteous,
unassuming intonation that he picked up from Borges decades ago.
</P>

HISTORIANS DIG FOR ARTIFACTS OF TEXAS INDIAN WARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the mid-1870s, long after Texas claimed its independence from
Mexico and the United States settled the Civil War, North Texans
were still brawling with the Plains Indians over exactly who owned
the land.
</P>
<P>
   The battles, probably more than 20 in all, were called the Red
River War, and they ranged from the summer of 1874 into early 1875.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because of more than $100,000 in new grants, the Texas
Historical Commission is setting out to detail that war by locating
the battle sites, generating site records and maps, nominating
sites to the National Register of Historic Places, and working with
area museums to exhibit findings.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any Alamos discovered or monuments built. This
war was carried on out of sight of most Texans, and it took place
in wide open spaces where cattle still graze.
</P>
<P>
   That presents a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those old battle sites are on private land, ranches
where the owners aren't always fond of strangers digging around in
their pastures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we're doing now is trying to provide the land
owners with assurances that their property rights are in no way
imperiled,'' said Pat Mercado-Allinger of the commission's
archaeology division.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling them we are simply interested in looking at
what is remaining from these battles. We want the land owners to
play a part in preserving this important history.''
</P>
<P>
   The battlegrounds range across the Texas Panhandle, including
Hutchinson, Armstrong, Briscoe, Gray and Hemphill counties. One
important goal of the study will be to increase tourism is those
areas. The commission is already receiving support from the
Panhandle Tourism and Marketing Council, a group including everyone
from the Panhandle Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, to several
area dude ranches.
</P>
<P>
   The plan includes splitting up any artifacts discovered among
many of the local museums, so each has something different to
offer. But there are a couple of hitches.
</P>
<P>
   The first is finding any artifacts; and the second is getting
the landowners' permission to remove them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The materials do belong to them,'' Mercado-Allinger said of
the property owners. ``We would assume custody on a temporary basis
_ for study _ but the artifacts do belong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the commission is deeply interested in getting the
American Indian take on the battles. That will require cooperation
from several tribes. The Red River War was waged against the
Comanche, Kiowa, Southern Cheyenne and Southern Arapaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be starting that shortly,'' she said of
collecting the American Indian perspective. ``I'll be going to
Oklahoma to meet with the various tribes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercado-Allinger said she would also be looking for information
from the Tonkawa and Delawares, who served as scouts for the
federal troops. So did the Seminole and Lipan Apache.
</P>
<P>
   Military columns converged on the tribes from several locations.
They came from Fort Sill, Okla.; Fort Union, N.M.; Fort Dodge,
Kan., as well as Fort Concho and Fort Richardson in Texas.

PATRIOTS EXPECTING BONUS POINTS IN NEW STADIUM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The color of money is the same in Foxborough
as it is in Hartford. It's just that in Hartford, there was almost
an unlimited amount of it. But in Foxborough, where a $250 million
stadium is scheduled to open by 2002 _ unless politics interferes _
there will be enough of it so that Patriots owner Robert Kraft
won't be dipping into his personal fortune to pay signing bonuses
to top players. That money will come from a revenue stream
generated by luxury boxes and premium seating.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the hope of Patriots officials.
</P>
<P>
   Team vice president Andy Wasynczuk said that parts of recent
signing bonuses given to Ted Johnson, Willie McGinest, Bruce
Armstrong, and Chris Slade came directly out of Kraft's pockets.
</P>
<P>
   A stadium deal in Hartford would have allowed Kraft to pay the
bonuses out of an incredible revenue stream without the blink of an
eye. Of course, even in Hartford, Kraft and the Patriots would have
had an NFL salary cap to abide by. For cap purposes, signing
bonuses are spread out over the length of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is, you want to have a competitive facility which
allows you to come up with the cash needed to pay out the signing
bonuses,'' said Wasynczuk. ``We believe right now a new Foxboro
(stadium) will do that. Of course, that all depends on the support
from the business community.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk was referring to businesses' willingness to commit to
long-term leases on luxury boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new stadium allows us to sustain a competitive advantage in
the marketplace,'' he said. ``As other teams have been building new
facilities, they have gone ahead of us, and as teams build new
stadiums across the country, we will now be able to be on par with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk claims the poor facility in Foxborough has hindered
the Patriots' ability to sign top free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, guys weren't spelling out their reasons for not
signing with the Patriots,'' said Wasynczuk, ``but what we'd hear
from our employees who would be giving those players a ride back to
the airport is along the lines of, `My high school facility was
better than this.' This was definitely an important component of
trying to sign players.''
</P>
<P>
   Patriots safety Willie Clay concurs. He said the two most
important factors in whether a player signs in a certain spot are
money and winning. But if those factors are equal, then the setting
is the next biggest factor.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots currently have a terrible practice situation;
players have to hop into their cars and drive a few miles to the
Wrentham State School.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk was part of the group that negotiated the Hartford
deal, along with Patriots vice president and owner representative
Jonathan Kraft. The younger Kraft negotiated what many believed was
the best deal in sports history, one that included the out clauses
that the Patriots were able to use when Connecticut wasn't able to
deliver on a 2002 move-in date.
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk is now helping finalize the architectural plans for
the new Foxborough facility, which will be similar to the ones
drawn up 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is we're not starting from ground zero,'' said
Wasynczuk. ``Those plans have been rekindled, but we're also
re-looking at them to see what other needs we'd have right now.
There's also the challenge of trying to build a stadium while we're
playing football in the old one and all of the problems that come
along with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasynczuk said the plans currently call for a 68,000-seat
open-air venue with 100-125 luxury boxes and 6,000 club seats.

LIME DISEASE VACCINE MAY NOT BE FOR EVERYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ You're not a hunter or a fisherman but you mow
the lawn, hike occasionally and play in the back yard with the kids
and dog.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean you should get the new vaccine against Lyme
disease, a potentially serious tick-borne illness that's spreading
throughout the Northeast, especially in New York and Connecticut?
</P>
<P>
   ``There really are no set guidelines,'' said Dr. Kris Saririan,
an allergist and immunologist in Latham, N.Y. ``You really should
individualize each case.''
</P>
<P>
   Health experts aren't dodging when they say they can't give a
one-size-fits all answer about LYMErix, the vaccine that went on
the market earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only pharmaceutical defense to date against Lyme
disease infection, and there's a lot of confusion about who should
get LYMErix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very personal, individual decision people should
make,'' said Dr. Barbara Wallace, director of the Bureau of
Communicable Disease Control for the New York Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's somebody's activities, where they do those activities and
the type of precautions they'll be taking,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, if you're living in or planning to spend significant
time in a tick hot-spot, like Long Island or the lower Hudson
Valley, the decision is easier. Those areas accounted for most of
New York's 4,409 cases of Lyme disease last year.
</P>
<P>
   Some other factors are important, too. If you've already had
Lyme disease, experts say the vaccine might be appropriate because
you've already proven you're at risk and there's always the chance
of being reinfected.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have any chronic arthritic conditions, including
rheumatoid arthritis, then the vaccine isn't for you. LYMErix,
which is manufactured by SmithKline Beecham, may aggravate such
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Early symptoms of the disease may include a circular rash around
the tick bite, fever, headaches and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   When diagnosed early, the disease is easily treated with
antibiotics. Untreated, however, the disease can cause arthritis,
numbness, facial paralysis, an irregular heartbeat and death.
</P>
<P>
   As with any vaccine, there are potential side effects, including
swelling at the injection site and flu-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Age also is a consideration. LYMErix is currently approved only
for adults and children over 15. Studies are under way to determine
if it's safe for younger children.
</P>
<P>
   Even with those caveats, people are still wondering what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gray zone,'' said Dr. Joel Kremer, a professor of
medicine and head of the division of rheumatology at the Albany
Medical Center. ``I don't think we need everyone to rush out and
get this vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who choose to get the vaccine, now is the ideal time:
``Lyme is really most prevalent in spring,'' Kremer said.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine doesn't offer a 100 percent guarantee against the
disease. And it's not a one-shot deal, either.
</P>
<P>
   LYMErix must be given in three doses over the course of a year,
with the first two shots spaced about a month apart and the last
one given 11 months later. Even at that point, the vaccine offers
only 75 to 80 percent protection against Lyme infection and doesn't
protect against other tick-borne illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some question as to whether vaccine recipients
will need an annual booster to retain the protection. Finally,
there's the issue of cost. While many health plans are covering the
vaccine, out-of-pocket costs for LYMErix can range from $150 to
$250.
</P>
<P>
   That's why many specialists say the most important factor to
weigh when considering the vaccine is your level of personal
vigilance against ticks. Protective measures include wearing
light-colored clothing so you can spot a tick more easily; using
insect repellent that contains DEET; keeping your property clear of
leaf litter and brush, which provide good hiding places for ticks;
and checking your body daily for ticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to tell people I've broken two full-length mirrors over
the past two years examining myself every night,'' said David Weld,
president of the American Lyme Disease Foundation in Somers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Besides avoiding contact with infected ticks, Lyme disease can
be avoided by removing ticks from the body within 36 hours.

CANADA'S CLOSE ENCOUNTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People travel for four main reasons _ new destinations, new
experiences, foreign flavor, and good value. Canada, an old
destination, has it all.
</P>
<P>
   The question, though, might be, with Canada so close, why go
elsewhere? Because Canada is so close, so friendly, and so
welcoming, it tends to get overlooked by all those who think they
have to cross the Atlantic to have new experiences, especially with
a foreign flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now that the American dollar is worth up to $1.50
Canadian, (on May 5 it was worth $1.44 Canadian), more vacationers
might get the idea to go north this year savoring the foreign
flavor along with some great values.
</P>
<P>
   Canada, however, is more than a money-saving destination, it's
packed with great cities, cultural experiences, outdoor adventures,
great scenery, and, yes, foreign flavor.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a lot happening throughout Canada, Nova Scotia
has a lot to interest New Englanders. From July 23 through July 25,
the Fortress of Louisbourg will celebrate the 250th anniversary of
its return to France. The fort, the largest historical
reconstruction in North America, will be the scene of battlefield
re-enactments, music, and other events. Halifax is marking its
250th anniversary with a series of events beginning June 26. On
July 1, Halifax will open Pier 21, Canada's Ellis Island. Between
1928 and 1971, more than 1.6 million immigrants arrived in Halifax,
many continuing on to America.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Canadians speak English _ mostly _ and, yes, they are not
only a lot like us but they also like us. So, why fly 3,000 miles
when you can experience a whole new world just a few hours drive
away _ even less by air?
</P>
<P>
   Canada is easy to reach. From Boston there is nonstop air
service to Toronto, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, Vancouver, and
the Atlantic provinces. By ship one can travel overnight aboard the
Scotia Prince that offers daily service between Portland, Maine,
and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia. From Bar Harbor, Maine, a high-speed
ferry offers three-hour cruises to Yarmouth _ in July and August
the service is twice daily. By rail, Amtrak offers connections with
Via Rail in Canada. There is also a new rail pass that covers trips
in both countries.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the border is also easy. While a passport is the best
identification, American citizens need neither a passport or visa
to cross into Canada. Travelers will need proof of citizenship such
as a birth certificate and an ID card _ driver's licence _ with
photo.
</P>
<P>
   US drivers' licenses are valid in Canada. Drivers should carry
proof of ownership of their vehicle, as well as proof of insurance.
Traffic laws and road signs are similar to the United States. One
exception, in Quebec right turns on red are prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Canada is on the metric system and mileage and miles per hour
are listed in kilometers: 25 km equals 15 miles; 50 km is 30 miles;
60 km is 36 miles; 80 km is 50 miles; and 100 km is 60 miles. Fuel
is also sold in liters. One US gallon is the equal of 3.78 liters.
</P>
<P>
   While Canada has a GST or Goods and Services Tax (7 percent) on
most goods and accommodations, and many provinces have a HST or
Harmonized Sales Tax (15 percent), Americans can receive a refund
on most purchases taken out of the country. Keep a receipt for a
refund. A brochure, ``Tax Refund Application for Visitors'' can be
found in many stores, some hotels, border crossings, and other
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Even Canada's currency is similar to ours, except of course for
``loonies'' and ``toonies.'' Canada uses coins instead of paper for
one- and two-dollars. The ``loonie'' is one dollar, the ``toonie''
is two dollars.

CAPILLARY ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new bit of sarcasm has been circling the cultural airport,
looking for permission to land, and last week _ after two flybys on
the same morning _ it finally buzzed into my consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   The putdown popped up first in Scott Shuger's daily newspaper
digest in Slate, the on-line magazine. Shuger noted that the New
York Times had buried an important detail about the Littleton,
Colo., shootings in paragraph 42 of a story, thus demonstrating ``a
real instinct for the capillaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Capillaries? It took a few seconds to decode the insult: An
instinct for the tiniest blood vessels, not the major ones? Aha _
he meant that the Times showed the opposite of ``an instinct for
the jugular.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours later, on WBUR's ``The Connection,'' in Boston, host
Christopher Lydon quoted a description of Henry James as ``a man
with a great instinct for the capillaries.'' He explained to his
baffled guest, the writer Cynthia Ozick, that it meant ``as opposed
to the arteries'' _ that James was a writer of fine detail, not
great slashing strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going for the jugular'' has been around for a while, but it's
not clear when it made its debut. The HarperCollins slang
dictionary gives jugular, solo _ derived from go for the jugular _
as a '60s synonym for ``cutthroat, savage,'' or ``vital, life and
death.''
</P>
<P>
   But the killer strike to the throat doesn't have to involve the
jugular veins. Jugular, related to yoke, refers to the neck area,
not just the blood vessels. There's an old verb, jugulate, meaning
to kill by slashing the neck, but English translators also used
throttle _ another word for strangle _ as a translation for the
Latin jugulare. Whatever the actual damage, going for the jugular
means your victim is getting it in the neck.
</P>
<P>
   The capillaries joke, though more recent, has been around longer
than you might think. The oldest citation in the Lexis/Nexis
database comes from a 1983 Fortune magazine piece: `` `By getting
Tymshare, (McDonnell Douglas) is adding 4 percent to the revenue
stream. That's like going for the capillaries instead of the
jugular,' quips aerospace expert Wolfgang Demisch.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sprinkling of citations since then, the would-be
catchphrase doesn't seem to be catching on. Along the way,
Democrats (in the Clarence Thomas confirmation battle), Republicans
(in the Clinton impeachment trial), Congress as a whole, and a few
attorneys and pols are accused of lacking that killer instinct. But
nobody gives a clue to the expression's pedigree till 1993, when
Murray Kempton writes, ``One of the older lawyerly adages is that,
when the jugular is beyond your reach, you can only go for the
capillaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe lawyers do understand the phrase in its short form _ and
can tell us when it began to circulate _ but journalists usually
add instead of the jugular, acknowledging that most everyday
readers aren't going to get going for the capillaries as a
free-standing witticism.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if David E. Kelley starts making his TV lawyers say
it every week, going for the capillaries has a chance; ``Ally
McBeal'' surely beats Slate as a way to spread the word. But it
remains a fairly complicated joke, and English speakers seem
content, for now, to leave it in its holding pattern and see how
long its fuel lasts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
No speed limits
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone recently used the phrase driving below 30 mph,''
writes Liza Cassarino of Foxborough. ``That doesn't sound right. It
should be driving under 30 mph _ but why?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great pleasure to report, for once, that nobody seems
eager to have this argument. It's true that among usagists and copy
editors, debates have raged about when to use over and more than
and above. And since most of the ``rules'' are based on the whims
and crotchets of 19th-century arbiters, it's no surprise that the
rationalizations are elaborate and the edicts widely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   But the below/under question has somehow escaped the legislative
fervor. The inimitable H.W. Fowler did devote an entry to below vs.
under in Modern English Usage (1926), noting that people were
starting to say ``under his breath'' when they ought to say below.
He lost that battle, and apparently nobody has taken up his
cudgels.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases like this, the preferred idiom comes naturally _
40 below zero, students under 18 _ and I suspect most people choose
to drive under 80 (and over 40). But I haven't yet found a language
cop who would ticket you for below 80 or above 40. Until you hear
the sirens, the word you choose is between you and your
speedometer.

STUDENT RUNNING FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kids today. They're OK. Some kids are more than
OK.
</P>
<P>
   Rashad L. Williams, a 15-year-old freshman at San Francisco's
Archbishop Riordan High School, is running the Bay to Breakers race
on Sunday to raise money for Lance Kirklin, one of the students who
was severely wounded in the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   According to Williams' mother, Sheila Burton-Harrison, her son
said, ``You know what, mom, that could have been me. I'm going to
run the Bay to Breakers for him. He may be in a wheelchair the rest
of his life. All I have to give him are my two legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams runs track and cross-country for Riordan, and on Monday
we met on the school's athletic fields. He's a handsome, serious
young man who runs the 400 and 800 meters and has a liquid,
purposeful stride.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him why a teen-ager would want to raise money to help a
badly wounded teen-ager he'd never met, but only heard of on the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw that travesty that happened out there, I had to do
something,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him if he could imagine losing the use of his legs. ``I
just think of the hurt,`` he said. ``Mental and physical.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of kid Rashad Williams is. He came in fifth in
the 800 in the West Catholic Association League. I said that was
pretty good for a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was what my coach said,'' Williams said. ``I said,
`Naah.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get many kids like this,'' said Frank Oross, who has
been a track coach and teacher at Riordan for 25 years. ``Not only
is he a good student and athlete, his heart's in the right place.
That's what we teach here.''
</P>
<P>
   Candy McDonald, secretary to the Rev. Timothy Kenney, principal
of Riordan, said, ``People always complain about teen-agers today.
But they're not all like that. Here they're taught to be a family.
When one hurts, they all hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers hurt for others far away, too. The day of the
Colorado shootings, you could imagine a national family of
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prayed in the morning and in the afternoon for the kids in
Littleton,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Williams decided to run the 7 1/2-mile Bay to Breakers
race for one of the Littleton kids, accepting pledges for each
mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday morning, I'll be there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll finish, too. Maybe even somewhere near the top.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nice little story, but when you get into it, you learn
some painful things.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ireland, 17, who suffered severe head injuries at
Columbine High School, is famous as ``the boy in the window,'' but
the rest of the injured kids aren't well-known beyond Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Denver Post listed three students as still
hospitalized at the Swedish Medical Center in Denver. (Ireland and
Sean Graves, 15, have been moved to Craig Hospital for
rehabilitation.)
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Hochalter, 17, is in serious condition in the
critical care unit with a gunshot wound to the chest. Richard
Castaldo, 17, is in fair condition with five gunshot wounds to the
chest, back and arm.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Kirklin, 16, for whom Williams will be raising money, is
in serious but stable condition with multiple gunshot wounds to the
chest, legs and face. Kirklin already has had numerous surgeries
from 30 surgeons, and reconstructive surgery on his jaw may take
two years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   These kids have received care in a ``multiple trauma unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes that seems to be what our country is.
</P>
<P>
   But then you meet Rashad Williams, his mom, Sheila
Burton-Harrison, and her 1-year-old boy, R.J. Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago they moved from San Francisco to Antioch. ``It's
quiet there,'' Burton-Harrison said. The family enrolled Rashad in
Riordan and his 8-year-old sister Remi Burton in San Francisco's
Fellowship Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of these private church schools is cheap. But
Burton-Harrison, an inspector for San Francisco public transit
system, and her husband, Anthony Harrison, who works for a bottled
water company, manage to pay the tuition and all the baby sitters,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Rashad, who hopes to become a veterinarian, gets up at 5:30
every morning to catch a train or a carpool to Riordan. He loves
it. ``I like the diversity here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rough out there,'' his mother said. ``I'm trying to arm
him with the best tools.''
</P>
<P>
   He has some pretty good ones already.
</P>

THE FINE ART OF GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Although I tried very hard to dislike the Bellagio
Gallery of Fine Art _ I mean, really, van Gogh and Picasso under
the same roof with SLOT MACHINES? _ I failed.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere among the 20 paintings, perhaps in front of Jackson
Pollack's frieze, I had to put down my snobby attitude and admit
that I was having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellagio Gallery, a $300 million element of the $1.6 billion
Bellagio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, certainly does not house
the biggest collection of master works.
</P>
<P>
   Two different but compelling van Goghs. Two Picassos. Three
Renoirs. A Cezanne, a Monet, a Manet, a Matisse and a Modigliani. A
Pissarro, a Degas, a Gauguin, the Pollack, a de Kooning, a Miro and
a painting each by Rembrandt (1633) and Rubens (1609).
</P>
<P>
   As much as the art itself, which snobbier folk than I have
conceded is top rate, the intimacy of the Bellagio Gallery is
irresistible. Until a proposed expansion is completed in September,
the two viewing rooms are Lilliputian by conventional art museum
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Their overall effect is to make you feel as if you've come to
call upon some ridiculously wealthy John Fowles character and been
asked by a butler to please wait in the master's private gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if you want to stand 3 feet in front of van Gogh's
``Peasant Woman Against a Background of Wheat'' until your knees
lock and your eyes cross (as mine did), you may do so. Although the
Bellagio Gallery is open every day from 9 a.m. to midnight, tickets
must be reserved. The staff keeps fairly tight control on the
number of folks who come in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the occasional visitor elects to plop her butt down on
the marble floor as though she were at a rave _ a young woman did
this on the afternoon I toured _ the tiny gallery seems to absorb
it.
</P>
<P>
   This is Vegas, after all, fine art or no. And, come to think of
it, Pablo, Vincent and Edouard probably would have approved, if not
jumped to paint the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Once I surrendered to the Bellagio Gallery experience, I didn't
even mind Steve Wynn's ``informative audio tour'' that comes via a
slim hand-held listening device as part of the $12 admission.
</P>
<P>
   The truly awesome hotel-casino complex was his vision; he
ignored everybody's derisive laughter and made it a whoppingly
successful reality. If Wynn wants to ``personally'' guide people
around his sumptuous little collection, what the hell?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he sounds a lot like the late Rod Serling of ``Twilight
Zone'' fame, which only adds to the surreal environment of the
gallery-in-a-casino.
</P>
<P>
   In an essay in the March 1 edition of the Nation magazine, art
editor Arthur C. Danto tipped his learned hat to the casino
entrepreneur, noting: ``... Wynn has gambled that a significant
population would be as attracted by van Gogh, Monet, Cezanne and
Picasso as by the magicians, stand-up comics, feminine
extravaganzas and impersonators that form the city's standard
repertoire of distractions and entertainments.''
</P>
<P>
   In a town that has become famous for offering elaborate replicas
_ New York, Paris, Mandalay Bay, Egyptian pyramids, Lake Como and
now Venice _ Danto said Wynn has chosen a radical path.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have installed a collection of real masters'' instead of
perfect reproductions of the world's greatest art, wrote Danto,
``is already to have taken a step toward the transformation of Las
Vegas from a theme park ...''
</P>
<P>
   Danto and Wynn would like to believe the transformation will
lead Vegas to become a magnet for ``people with higher
sensibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   People, say, who will spend money on one-armed bandits and then
on one-eared artists.

<TEXT>
<P>
   He was a dreamer once, Dana Rosenblatt was. But no more.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years as a prizefighter have changed wispy dreams into
harsh realities for the Malden middleweight. Broken hands.
Dehydration. Battles with weight. One brief duel with
unconsciousness. Broken promises. It adds up.
</P>
<P>
   These things all have been part of his athletic life, but none
of them are what transforms a boxer's dream into a professional's
skepticism. Such things follow with the choice you make the first
time you walk up the three short steps that separate civilians from
fistfighters and accept money for hand-to-hand combat. Soon enough
every fighter learns that.
</P>
<P>
   So, no, it was not those things that broke the dream. It was
other things, things you never knew about when you were 20 and full
of hope. Conniving promoters. World ratings not worth the paper
they're printed on. A career too long put on hold by people who
never have known how your lungs can burn after 12 rounds of
fighting for your life.
</P>
<P>
   That is what kills a dream. Or at least that's what can wound
it.
</P>
<P>
   So now, a week and a half before he journeys to his second home
at Foxwoods Casino to fight a kid from Baltimore named Lloyd Bryan
that he's never met in an ESPN2 main event, Dana Rosenblatt dreams
no more. He fights instead. Fights the reality and the dream.
Fights just to keep on fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to drop the idealism from your motivation to keep
getting out on the road in the morning and sparring at night,''
said Rosenblatt (34-1, 23 KOs). ``Seven years in boxing and my
ideals are about gone out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports is not a level deal once you're off the playground. The
only place a fight is level is in the schoolyard. It's not that way
in the professional ranks anyway, so I have no ideals any more when
I look at boxing. I don't look at the sports arena and think
justice is served any more, no matter who wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the cynical side at 20 but now my wife laughs that
all I say is `no, can't, won't, never will be.' There's no way this
life doesn't carry over into how you look at other things. It's
different to be in something where the goal is to win a world title
and never get a chance to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For most prizefighters, that is their fate. The fighters fight
but not for the prize they dreamed of. Not for the title. They
fight to survive instead.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosenblatt's case, he was close four years ago, when he was
rated in the top 10 by the World Boxing Council and World Boxing
Association and reached No. 1 in the World Boxing Union only to be
knocked cold by an old warrior who had known many triumphs and just
as many tragedies. The night Vinny Pazienza overcame what was
becoming a savage beating with one crushing right to Rosenblatt's
temple, the dreamer began to become a professional himself.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the lesson he learned was not just a harsh one.
It was costly, and he has been paying for it ever since as his
career slowed to a crawl once a broken hand followed in his
comeback fight and a second one came right behind it the first week
he tried to spar again.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Rosenblatt has been fighting for a living but not
for a shot at the middleweight title. That is still his dream, and
dreams _ like professional fighters _ die hard. But Rosenblatt
dreams less these days about title belts because he cannot see them
on the horizon any more.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he fights for money. He is a professional now, a
professional still hoping his break will come but expecting little
more than a hard night's work to earn his living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 10th or 11th in the WBA and 16th in the WBC and they've
both got a lot of obscure names in front of me but that's my lot
for now,'' Rosenblatt said, sounding like the philosophy student
he's become at UMass-Boston, where he is 15 classes short of a
bachelor's degree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reduced to going after titles that carry a lot less
recognition like the IBA for now, knowing that beating a Terry
Norris means more than winning one of those belts.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the night Rosenblatt beat Norris despite fading late with a
dehydration problem, he didn't get what he expected. Norris was a
world champion several times over and though well past his prime
still knew how to fight, still had to be contended with, still had
to be beaten down. Rosenblatt did all that. Yet he did not get the
credit from most corners because people said Norris was no longer
Norris and so Rosenblatt was diminished in victory simply because
he couldn't destroy him.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ludicrous position to take, as ludicrous as some of his
supporters trying to diminish what Pazienza had done to Rosenblatt
in his only loss just because he was losing badly until the moment
he knocked Rosenblatt out.
</P>
<P>
   A fighter deserves what he earns, at least in the ring, and that
night against Norris, Rosenblatt earned respect. Of course, he
didn't quite get it so now he fights on, this time against Bryan
(18-2, 8 KOs), knowing all he can hope for is to keep winning and
be ready if his phone rings unexpectedly one day because an injury
or boxing's politics have conspired against someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially I've been on the right side of things in boxing,''
said Rosenblatt, who made more than $100,000 last year and figures
to do at least as well in 1999 after pulling in $50,000 May 21.
``I've been luckier than most fighters, so it's worked out for me
on that end and I'm thankful for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wasn't white and didn't have Foxwoods to fight at, I know
things would be different. That's the other side of this sport. If
my name was Jose Rio or something, I wouldn't be on the right end
of either end.
</P>
<P>
   ``My promoter (Bob Arum) didn't disappear after I lost. He got
me right back in and I earned $30,000 to fight Glenwood Brown but I
busted my hand and was out a long time. Last year they got me
Norris for $70,000 so it's hard to say I've been forgotten. It's
just the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The politics of the middleweight division are that promoter Don
King controls two-thirds of the title, with Keith Holmes and
William Joppy as WBC and WBA champions, while International Boxing
Federation champion Bernard Hopkins fights for America Presents,
with whom Arum has done business in the past. Unfortunately, that
organization doesn't have Rosenblatt rated, for reasons no one can
quite fathom, and so he cannot fight for its title.
</P>
<P>
   So he fights in limbo, like so many other boxers, a 27-year-old
who still carries a champion's dream but keeps it buried now. Well
buried under seven years of learning how harsh boxing can be to
those who love it most _ the prizefighters who bleed for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make 154 for a while because Top Rank could get me
a title shot there but I couldn't make the weight,'' Rosenblatt
said. ``So I just keep moving along.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get an opportunity to fight, I look at it for what it
is. I'm happy for what I have and I don't brood about what I don't
have. I get paid what I'm entitled to because of what I can
generate when I fight. I'm a hell of a lot busier than most
fighters and I probably make more than some of the champions. For
now, that's what I got.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only disadvantage is that if you win these kind of fights,
you don't get much credit, but if you don't look good, you get
crucified and if you lose, you're screwed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I know what I need. I need some spectacular knockouts
because that's the sick sensationalism the whole country is gripped
by today. Nobody looks to see if there's any substance to what's
behind it. They just want to see something spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been on both sides of that. I got no credit for beating a
legitimate guy like Norris but I knocked out Chad Parker in 30
seconds four years ago and people are still talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt's point is well taken. Norris had been world champion
several times and world ranked for years even though he was
admittedly past his prime. Parker had the phoniest 31-0 record ever
made and never fought again after Rosenblatt destroyed him. But
that's boxing . . . as he now understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't really know how to value achievements properly
but that's the way the boxing business goes,'' Rosenblatt said.
``So you take what you can get. If I hadn't lost to Vinny, I'd
probably be in a different position today. I know that. My career
suffered a mortal blow that night but I made a lot of money
($350,000) and I know I'm on the cusp of making that kind of money
again if I can just get a couple of breaks with the right kind of
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not dreaming. The title is dreaming. Making money is
reality. It's being in the right place at the right moment and
being ready when you get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing isn't a dream any more. It's a job. It's not like I'm a
mercenary. I still want to fight for the title, but the system
sucks the idealism out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, after it does, you are a professional. You are a
prizefighter then, as Dana Rosenblatt now understands, and the
prizefighter fights for whatever prize they offer until the real
prize _ the dream long buried _ shows up.
</P>
<P>
   If it ever does.

HOSTETTER'S WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of years ago, not long after US West bought Boston's
Continental Cablevision, top executives of the Denver-based Baby
Bell telephone company stopped by The Boston Globe to tout the
deal, accompanied by the man who had sold them the company.
</P>
<P>
   US West had renamed the company MediaOne and put Chuck Lillis in
charge. Lillis had sold everything from Fuller brushes to Wharton
Econometric forecasting services. He was seated among a phalanx of
other US West executives that day. He took over and held forth.
</P>
<P>
   He touted the joys of ``broadband,'' meaning the superefficient
transmission of telephone, television and Internet through a single
``pipe'' that Continental Cablevision had pioneered.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing to indicate that the man sitting quietly to
his right, Amos B. Hostetter, was widely regarded as dean of the
cable television industry. Nor that he was one of the dozen most
widely admired businessmen in Boston, second only to Fidelity's
Edward Johnson as a company-builder.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was there anything to suggest that the deal had made
Hostetter truly wealthy, one of a small circle of Boston
billionaires, including Johnson, Richard Smith of Harcourt General,
Sumner Redstone of Viacom, and private equity specialist Thomas H.
Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter sat easily off to the side. If he was restless at
having been eclipsed, he didn't show it _ at least not much. He sat
sideways in his seat, closest to the door. When it was time to go,
he didn't linger.
</P>
<P>
   So when US West later that year announced it would move
Continental's operations to Denver from its headquarters on Lewis
Wharf, it did not come entirely as a surprise that Hostetter quit
the MediaOne board in anger.
</P>
<P>
   Lillis had broken his word, Hostetter told friends. The move was
not only unnecessary, it was also counterproductive. All but 15 or
so of Hostetter's staff of 160 quit with their chief rather than
move.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Hostetter told the Globe's Steve Bailey, ``I was
cross-eyed I was so angry. I was totally duped, used.'' Revenge
wasn't high on his list, Hostetter said. But then he added, ``I
really believe in business, you get back a fair measure of what you
give. I think the way current management is doing business will
ultimately bring its own demise without any help from me.''
</P>
<P>
   He was half right.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, AT&AMP;T Corp. topped what had seemed a generous
offer by Comcast Corp. with a $58-billion bid. If Lillis isn't out
on the street already, he will be soon. The Denver management is in
deep demise.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetter, however, himself turned out to be a key sherpa for
the deal makers. When family-owned Comcast failed to offer
Hostetter voting shares for his 9.5 percent stake in MediaOne, he
called up AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive C. Michael Armstrong has made clear that his
company already was thinking about making a pass at MediaOne _ Why
not? A month earlier it had bought a still bigger cable firm _ but
that Hostetter had increased its enthusiasm for the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was able to give us a confirmation of the insights about
the value we could extract from the investment,'' said Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   So Hostetter will rejoin the industry from which he was briefly
sidelined as adviser (executive chairman) to Leo Hindery, chief of
AT&AMP;T's broadband and internet services unit. He will sit on AT&AMP;T's
board of directors as well, joining John C. Malone, who became
AT&AMP;T's single biggest shareholder in March when he sold his TCI
Corp. to the phone company for stock.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sale of Continental Cablevision two years ago,
Hostetter has put on a pretty good impression of retirement. He
serves as board chairman at Amherst College. He established, with
his wife, Barbara, a $500 million foundation dedicated to education
reform. He spends plenty of time on Nantucket.
</P>
<P>
   But the electronic convergence of telephone, television,
computer hardware, software, entertainment and Internet services is
just beginning in the United States, not ending. Hostetter has
regained his seat at the table.

   How do you become a big winner in electronic retailing?
</P>
<P>
   Pick a category with huge sales, establish a presence before
anyone else does, spend heavily to promote your brand name, and

service that he couldn't get in a normal store.

   The Worcester company has been around only since last June, but
it already has followed most of the steps on the Amazon path to
success. It has raised $13 million from some of the best names in
venture capital, including CMGI Inc., the Andover firm that backed
such winners as Lycos and GeoCities. It has a simple name that all
but guarantees it will attract Internet traffic. It has tied up
some of the best real estate on search engines like Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is over; this company already owns the category,'' a
breathless analyst from Needham &AMP; Co. wrote after listening to a
presentation from Furniture.com at an investment conference last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Spend some time with Andrew Brooks, the company's chief
executive, and you too may come away with the impression that you
are in on the ground floor of something exciting. Brooks and his
staff of about 100 work out of an old brick building in Worcester,
Mass. that looks more 19th century than 21st century. Yet the
vision they have of furniture retailing is definitely futuristic.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that you are sitting at home staring at a computer,
which has a picture of your house and and its current furnishings
on the screen. Want to see what a new couch might look like in your
living room? Just press some buttons and the couch drops into the
picture. Want to turn it green, move it across the room? All
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be something the retail experience can't mimic,''
Brooks says. The key word here is ``will.'' The type of wizardry
Brooks is promising is at least two years away when greater
bandwidth is available to the average household.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Furniture.com is offering a Web site with
50,000 selections from more than 100 different manufacturers. The
Web site has been redesigned several times in the last few months
to make it more user-friendly. The company has 15 design
consultants who can provide help either on the phone or on line.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is such a good salesman you can almost forget to ask the
most obvious question. Is anyone really going to buy furniture over
the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was initially skeptical,'' says Donald Bellomy, an analyst
with the Aberdeen Group in Boston. Unlike books, pieces of
furniture are expensive. And as Bellomy puts it, if you buy on
line, ``You can't bounce on the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to analysts, however, roughly 2 percent of furniture
sales already are made through catalogs or over the phone. As time
goes by, the betting is that more people will be willing to make
purchases without kicking the tires in a showroom.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Vroom, an analyst with Thomas Weisel Partners in San
Francisco, predicts that the Internet can capture 20 percent of the
sales in the $60 billion furniture industry over a period of years.
If home furnishings like rugs and lamps are added to the mix, the
potential annual sales could be much larger, says Vroom. On-line
furniture sales today are probably too small to measure.
Furniture.com, which is privately held, does not disclose sales
figures.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the furniture industry is ripe for change. They
say the business is fragmented, management is weak, and service is
too often disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Furniture retailers are our friends,'' says Brooks, ``because
they have made the shopping experience so miserable.'' Brooks says
the average customer visits five stores before making a furniture
purchase. Once a purchase is made, delivery can take another two to
four months because almost all furniture is made to order.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks hopes to do better. He predicts that by gathering
national data on consumer preferences he can reshape the furniture
industry into something the customer will like better. He also
hopes to shrink delivery time dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Separating the hype from reality is difficult in the Internet
world. While some already have declared Furniture.com a winner,
Donald Bellomy is probably closer to the mark when he describes the
company as a ``work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Will consumers flock to the Internet to buy furniture? If they
do, will they choose Furniture.com? Stay tuned.

BLAZING WORKOUT BY SILVERBULLETDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Silverbulletday is ready.
</P>
<P>
   The champion filly, winner of the Eclipse Award as a 2-year-old,
blazed 5 furlongs in :59, out 6 furlongs in 1:11 3/5, at Churchill
Downs Monday, as she prepares to take on males in the Preakness at
Pimlico Saturday. Trainer Bob Baffert held Silverbulletday, who is
slight of build, out of the Kentucky Derby May 1, and she easily
won the Kentucky Oaks the previous day. Since the Derby resembled
the Charge of the Light Brigade, and Silverbulletday almost
certainly would have been smacked arund, it appears Baffert made
the right decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the smartest move I made all week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday, who has won 10 of 11 career starts, really
smoked Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, after she worked, they'd have to put water on the
track to cool it down,'' said Baffert. ``It was the kind of work I
was looking to get out of her. She put in a nice stiff work,
galloped out strong, and came back great. That's what you want to
see coming into a race like the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert also intends to run his other outstanding filly, the
bigger-framed Excellent Meeting, who will work Tuesday at
Churchill, in the Preakness. Excellent Meeting, the only one to
defeat Silverbulletday, finished fifth in the Derby, with a strong
late run, after being as far back as 18th. Monday, Baffert
cross-entered both fillies in Friday's Black-Eyed Susan, but the
Black-Eyed Susan is worth $200,000, while the Preakness, which will
be drawn Wednesday, has a purse of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the luck of the draw now,'' he said. ``Fate will decide
whether we run in the Preakness or not. Everything looks good now,
and we'll wait to see what happens in the draw. These are two great
fillies and I'm not going to waste a start. I want to run to win.''
</P>
<P>
   As of now, Baffert intends to enter his best 3-year-old colt,
Prime Timber, in the Sir Barton, a $100,000 stake on the Preakness
undercard. Prime Timber was buffeted about while finishing fourth
in the Derby, and Baffert wants to get a race into him, while
pointing toward the Belmont Stakes June 5, without putting him
through the rigors of the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a rough trip in the Derby,'' said Baffert. ``If I'm
going to go to the Belmont with him, I just can't sit on him, then
ask him to go 1 1/2 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sorting out the field
</P>
<P>
   First American, who was 16th in the Derby, was withdrawn from
Preakness consideration Monday, after it was discovered he had a
chip in his ankle. With K One King, eighth in the Derby, having
been withdrawn Saturday because of ankle and leg problems, and
assuming Baffert is serious about entering Prime Timber on the
undercard, there are 15 horses currently in training for 14 spots
in the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Since entrance into the Preakness is based on overall earnings,
the Valhol situation may once again play a part in who starts.
Valhol won the Arkansas Derby April 10, earning $300,000, but his
jockey, Bill Patin, was accused of carrying an electrical device
during the race. The Oaklawn stewards held up Valhol's purse, but
the horse's owner, James Jackson, won a ruling from an Arkansas
district court that released the money. That allowed Valhol, who
would have been excluded because of lack of graded earnings, to
start in the Derby, in which he finished 15th.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Derby, the Oaklawn stewards have held a hearing and
officially disqualified Valhol, taking away his purse. Pimlico is
honoring the stewards' decision, meaning Valhol, with only $44,100
in earnings, would be the one excluded from the Preakness. However,
Jackson's lawyers have a hearing set for Wednesday with the
Arkansas Racing Commission, which oversees the Oaklawn stewards, at
which they hope to have the decision overturned. If not, they will
probably return to court to get an injunction.
</P>
<P>
   If Valhol gets in, Torrid Sand would be knocked out. Torrid
Sand, who was third under the wire in the Arkansas Derby, got
$50,000 for third, but was awarded $100,000 for second upon the
disqualification of Valhol. If Jackson wins his appeal, Torrid Sand
would be re-placed third, and would have $91,400 in earnings, the
least of the Preakness aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 assured of a spot in the Preakness, should their
connections so choose, are, in order of earnings: Silverbulletday;
Derby winner Charismatic; Excellent Meeting; Cat Thief, third in
the Derby; Vicar, 18th; Menifee, second; Kimberlite Pipe, sixth;
Stephen Got Even, 14th; Adonis, 17th; Worldly Manner, seventh;
Badge, fourth in the Wood Memorial; Patience Game, first in the
Kentucky Derby Trial; and Lead Em Home, fifth in the Derby Trial.
</P>
<P>
   One more scratch before would render this moot. Since the Daily
Racing Form lists Valhol at 50-1 for the Preakness, and Torrid Sand
at 99-1, it really doesn't make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fast worker
</P>
<P>
   Menifee, who made a big charge to gain the place in the Derby,
zipped a half-mile in :47 at Churchill Monday, galloping out 5
furlongs in :59 3/5, under the watchful eye of trainer Elliott
Walden. ``Good horses work fast,'' said Walden. ``He's feeling good
and we're ready to go. He worked super, and did it on his own. He
might not be as far back early as he was in the Derby.'' . . .
Vicar, who was ridden by Shane Sellers in the Derby, does not yet
have a rider for the Preakness. Sellers accepted the mount on
Kimberlite Pipe when Vicar's trainer, Carl Nafzger, was slow to
commit to the Preakness.

POETIC TOUCHES LIFT JOURNAL OF RENEWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
UNDER THE DEVIL'S THUMB 
By David Gessner 
University of Arizona Press, 213 pp., $16.95 (paperback) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as journalism is the first draft of history, journals are
the first draft of personal history. They make an excellent tool
for capturing moments, sorting emotions, and gaining new
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the rare writer who can start with his journal and end
up with literature. ``Under the Devil's Thumb,'' the new collection
of essays by David Gessner, opens the question of whether he is one
of those writers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the foremost obstacle is that journals would be
pointless without the first person, and unless done deftly, all
that navel-gazing can quickly become tiresome, even annoying.
Gessner has clearly considered the problem:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always a bold gamble to think anyone might actually be
interested in you,'' he writes. ``But, if I cut myself some slack,
I can see my song as a modest entry in a great, old tradition. `I
should not talk about myself so much if there were any body else
whom I knew as well,' wrote Thoreau. . . . It has been said before
but bears repeating: we are all the first person.''
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of Gessner's craft _ what writing should be, how
it changes him, how it connects him to his brother and the earth _
course endlessly through ``Under the Devil's Thumb,'' just as
creeks course through the Western landscape that provides the
grounding for many of Gessner's stories.
</P>
<P>
   Gessner grew up in Worcester and spent summers at the Cape, but
five years ago, at a bit more than 30 years old, he contracted
cancer. He survived, but one of the cancer's casualties was his
past. He decided to go west and start anew, while he still could.
He went looking for ``renewal and regeneration.'' That hope did not
extend to his right testicle, which is where the cancer resided and
which was removed. Upon arrival in Colorado, he found his new
writing task: ``I tried to excavate the past. I worked like
Sisyphus rolling a giant testicle up a mountainside.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between the ``dull, gray sinkhole'' of Worcester
and Rocky Mountain freshness is the first of many opportunities to
reflect on how ``where'' affects ``who.'' Who Gessner becomes in
his new hometown of Eldorado Springs, Colo., is a convert, and a
zealous convert at that. He celebrates his re-creation of the
westward pioneer's spirit, and rues bitterly the despoiling of the
West begun with atom bomb tests in the '40s and continuing today at
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons site, just 10 miles down the road.
</P>
<P>
   He dives into learning about the native birds and flora. He
attacks mountain trails on his bicycle, grooving on the pain as a
way to be present in the moment. He is passionate about his wife,
his wife's cats, about wild cats. He cannot help but to analogize.
``I challenge anyone, no matter how scientific and unromantic, to
walk through this country without breaking into paroxysms of simile
and metaphor-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Gessner's gung-ho gusto is leavened by a wealth of
fresh observations that may well spring from the same source. He
revels in the land, for example, but is ``worn down by the
relentless pessimism of knowing we are destroying what we worship.
. . . We are settlers . . . with all of that word's connotations of
accepting less than what once was.'' Part of that destruction is at
the hands of those who would own their piece of paradise, where
they can build their dream houses. Larger-scale destruction
emanates from Madison Avenue, as it covers every butte with some
four-wheeling beauty.
</P>
<P>
   For all his looking inward, Gessner is adept when looking
outward, too, and can describe what he sees gracefully, such as
when ``a thousand white hares dart in front of the truck'' while
he's driving through a snowstorm, and perceptively, as when a
cutting mountain wind ``at once numbed and woke us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the success of ``Under the Devil's Thumb'' is
decided more by these poetic touches than by Gessner's ``bold
gamble,'' which is really not too different from what all journal
writers do. We experience, we write and record, and sometimes we
share what we've felt and seen. And then we start anew.

<P>
   The International Jazz Festival of Montreal celebrates its 20th
anniversary July 1 through 11 with some new features including the
sounds and tastes of Louisiana. The festival will be held noon to
midnight daily and featuring 400 events (300 free concerts) within
a four-block downtown area. Adding to the festival will be a daily
parade inspired by the popular marching bands of New Orleans.
Another innovation will be cruises aboard the riverboat
Nouvelle-Orleans June 30 through July 10. Two cruises will be
offered, the first includes a Louisiana-style feast and music, the
second is at midnight and features Cajun and zydeco music. Among
performers this year will be Miles Davis, Cassandra Wilson, and the
Dave Brubeck Quartet. Programming for the festival will be
announced May 11, and the free outdoor concerts will be announced
on June 17. Tickets for the festival are now on sale. For tickets
or information on the festival, call 888-515-0515. Complete tourist
packages are available. Information is also available at

<P>
   Each May, 3 million tulips blossom for the Canadian Tulip
Festival in Canada's scenic National Capital Region. The festival
celebrates friendship, and this year the May 14 through 24 festival
will mark the unique friendship between the United States and
Canada. The festival, now the world's largest tulip event, began in
1945 with the gift of 100,000 tulips from Princess Juliana of the
Netherlands as a token of gratitude for sheltering the Dutch royal
family during World War II. Among the spectacular floral sculptures
planned are one based on Van Gogh's ``Iris,'' and another
representing a floral map of the two countries with bouquets that
highlight the official flowers of the 63 states, provinces, and
territories.

Two country rail pass
</P>
<P>
   A rail pass that allows travelers to create a custom itinerary
throughout Canada and the United States for one fare is now being
discounted 10 percent for seniors, children, and students. The
Amtrak/VIA North American Rail Pass allows a trip of up to 30
consecutive days over 28,000 miles of railways and 900
destinations. One segment of the trip must be in both countries.
The discount applies to both peak and off-peak fares. Peak fare is
$645 June 1 through Oct. 15; off-peak fare is $450 Oct. 16 through
Dec. 31.

   Heritage Plantation in Sandwich on Cape Cod opens for its 30th
season this week. The museum is an Americana theme park on 76
landscaped acres with magnificent rhododendrons and daylily
gardens. Opening day offers free admission for mothers, who also
receive a free ice cream cone at the Carousel Cafe. On display this
year will be ``Edge to Edge: Selections from Studio Art Quilt
Associates'' focusing on the diversity of creativity in textiles
made in the last decade. The Military Museum will feature ``A
Splendid Little War, The Spanish American War, 1898.'' In the J. K.
Lilly III Antique Automobile Museum's gallery will be an exhibit,
``The Lynn Beach Painters: Art Along the North Shore of
Massachusetts, 1880-1920.'' The museum is open daily 10 a.m. to 5
p.m. through Oct. 17. For recorded information, call 508-888-1212.

   Do you know anyone who looks like Queen Victoria? New
Brunswick's newest luxury inn, Windsor House of St. Andrews, is
looking for a Queen Victoria lookalike for its grand opening on May
24. Since she reigned from 1837 to 1901, co-owner Jay Remer said
their Queen Victoria could reflect any of the years of her

SWINGS GLIDE BACK INTO POPULARITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ We just never seem to outgrow some things. One of
them is swings _ the porch swing in particular.
</P>
<P>
   These are making a big comeback, now that porches are back in
style.
</P>
<P>
   This gentle piece of furniture was where some of us planned our
futures, got engaged, settled in with a good book and glass of
lemonade, napped, listened to the peepers in the hot night air,
told ghost stories, sang songs, lolled babies to sleep, chatted
with family and neighbors or just tried to catch a cool breeze and
while away the hours.
</P>
<P>
   Swings as furniture fell from favor as people were lured inside
by television and air conditioning and houses sans porches.
</P>
<P>
   As we reflect on the last century, old wrought-iron, steel or
aluminum gliders from the 1930s through the 1950s can still be
found at yard sales and flea markets. They can look like new with a
coat of paint and cushions. Or buy a new one. Manufacturers are
making reproduction glider swings and modern-looking ones to fit
contemporary tastes.
</P>
<P>
   If you prefer a swing, you'll need strong porch beams to fasten
it to, or try a free-standing version, which comes with its own
stand of either metal or matching wood.
</P>
<P>
   When buying a metal swing, make sure it features a
rust-resistant coating. A good wood swing should be
insect-resistant and weatherproofed so it will hold up to the
elements. Cedar is self-preserved and hardwoods can be stained or
painted.
</P>
<P>
   Swings can be found at antiques shops, flea markets, garden
centers and where swimming pools and fencing are sold.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ensslin, owner of Classic Sheds and Gazebos in Albany, N.Y.,
advised measuring your porch or patio before shopping for a swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want a swing too close to a window,'' Ensslin said.
``If you don't have the space on a porch for one, get a
free-standing swing for the patio or lawn that has a canopy to keep
you dry or protect you from the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Free-standing swings and gliders cost from $198 to $640 and up,
depending on the material and size. Swings cost $99 to $200 and up.
You can save on costs by making it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing any swing, always use care when small children are
around, especially with gliders.

AN ANOMALY IN KEY BISCAYNE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. _ Tricky Dick and Bebe _ was that a sitcom
with the laugh on us? _ are gone. But that doesn't mean the island
has lost its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that depends on what appeals to you. Federal
government employee Richard Nixon, the trickster, and his pal Bebe
Rebozo had Key Biscayne homes, and were the darlings of many. They
often communed in the presidential bunker for such vital affairs of
state as cheering the televised feats of Nixon's beloved Washington
Redskins _ whom he coached in his fantasy life _ or adding names to
his storied Enemies List. Most of those listed (such as the Globe's
storied writer, George Frazier) rejoiced in their guilt by
disassociation with the trickster's style.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's home, once an attraction to be pointed out to gawkers,
has been razed, replaced by a more lavish dwelling. The place that
appeals to me, though, the Silver Sands Motel, was also destroyed,
in 1992 by a blowhard named Andrew. Namely the malevolent Hurricane
Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't much left. Rubble and sand,'' says Orlando
Garcia, the manager. ``You can see the concrete slab over there,
the floor, all that remains of our restaurant and bar. We hope to
rebuild that someday as we did the motel rooms. We look the same
now as we always did.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one appealing, comforting feature for long-time customers
and a rookie roomer like me. Amid the highly-risen Miami
Beachification of condos and hotels, and the opulent houses of Key
Biscayne's rich, sits the Sands, overwhelmed and nearly hidden, a
one-story sqatter on the beach. An anomaly, it seems an
anachronistic stranger in town, out of its time and level. But it's
the other architecture, come-lately stuff that doesn't fit the
feeling upheld by the Sands: the old, barefoot Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six rooms with kitchenettes plus a couple of cottages open
onto a lush tropical garden and swimming pool at center. Not that
you need a pool. The Atlantic Ocean, soothingly murmuring, mumbling
_ though sometimes rambunctiously growling _ is so close you may
fall in getting out of bed. Probably too close. But the place was
built before ground-ruling codes, thus was grandfatherly permitted
to return to the original foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Actually the Sands isn't that old, except that 1956 is pretty
ancient on this island that is connected to Miami, three miles
distant, by a couple of bridges. An agreeable local taxi driver out
of Boston University, Michael Coppola, loves the plain-and-friendly
cinder block joint, especially the bygone barroom _ ``when I was
drinking.'' He says scenes from the marvelous Bogart movie, ``Key
Largo'' (with Lauren Bacall, Claire Trevor, Edward G. Robinson,
Lionel Barrymore), were shot in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   However, Pepe Bara, a desk clerk for years, smiles, and spoils a
good story with the facts. ``Michael's a romantic. That movie was
made before 1956.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' laughs Garcia. ``But a considerably less distinguished
film, `Porky's' did some scenes here. Sorry, no Bogart. But one of
the stars, Dan Monahan, who played Peewee, was a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the restaurant is gone, two of the Key's favored
nosheries are within walking distance. You might bump into Gabriela
Sabatini, the Divine Argentine, breakfasting at personable Ben
Zambrano's Donut Gallery. But you won't find gladhanding Stefano at
the place he founded, Stefano's. Reportedly he is far from any
beach at a goverment installation. Something about taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Not a taxing tramp is the beach walk southward, becoming a
greater pleasure as soon as you move beyond man-made structures and
enter a preserve of dunes and mangrove mercifully and thoughtfully
given over to Bill Baggs Park, a natural defense against
developers. One structure does appear, though, majestic in its
towering loneliness at the southern tip: the 174-year-old Cape
Florida Lighthouse of whitewashed brick.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, depending on tides, aisles of sand will appear at
water level inviting you to walk well out to sea, appearing to
those back on shore like a divine doing an ocean stroll.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the water is lazy and clear it will reveal all sorts of
creatures sidling up to your sandbar path. Rays flapping. Eels
slithering. Crabs that look like cops aching to make a pinch.
Crowds of finned schoolmates, perhaps taking swimming lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saw some barracuda. Beauties,'' said Alese Pechter whom we
encountered one morning. She and husband Mort, Florida natives from
Delray Beach, are astute professional photographers of life above
and below sea level.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we swim in this water?'' My friend, Aurelio, was maybe
having second and third thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always have,'' Mort said. ``The creatures don't resent our
having a piece of their action. The ocean is big enough for all of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Silver Sands isn't. I'd been advised to book a year in
advance to assure a room for the 14-year-old tennis tournament, The
Lipton. Probably the best of US tennis tournaments, it occurs each
spring at Crandon Park only a mile up the street, and has been
renamed for a new sponsor in 2000 as The Ericsson, an angel bearing
cell phone. A French journalist friend, getting the same tip,
delayed, and was shut out this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, that place may be nice in a modest way, but it doesn't
have a monopoly on Old Florida,'' a friend, Harry Kirsch, wanted me
to know. His wife, Chris, said, ``There's also Old Florida hotel
elegance, albeit pricier, that preceded all of us: The Biltmore in
Coral Gables, not far from the Key.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed _ and the Kirsch's showed us the way.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Miami Beachification and Ft. Lauderdaleizing crowded
Florida's East Coast with stacks of concrete, the Biltmore stood
proudly aloof and lofty, back in the Twenties, overseeing the
Gables while bathed in an F. Scott Fitzgeraldian aura. Not all the
monied guests were pedigreed. Al Capone, who may have done business
with Jay Gatsby, tenanted the exalted tower suite, and golfed on
the hotel course. Did his clubs share a golf bag with a tommy gun?
</P>
<P>
   Bankrupted by the Florida Crash of '26 (a precursor of the
national financial flop in 1929), the hotel went through a variety
of traumas and ownerships, served in World War II as a military
hospital, lost plenty of money but not its singular dignity,
stretching up to the 15 story tower.
</P>
<P>
   Soaring in a soft shade of sienna,the centerpiece of its
Mediterranean neighborhood as it makes yet another comeback, the
Biltmore is an experience in Continental flair, vaulted lobby, and
high Italiante ceilings. Drinks beside the vast, handsome pool,
guarded by reflected statuary, as dusk arrives was followed by
dinner beside a fountain in the tiled courtyard. A changing of the
guard as the sentinels were moon and stars.
</P>
<P>
   It was, well, elegant.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now back to your little motel?'' Chris and Harry bade us
goodnight.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I like to fall out of bed into the Atlantic. Besides, it's
historic. A president walked that beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon,'' said Aurelio, backing me up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did,'' said Chris, ``I'll bet he never took off his
wingtips and socks.''

CLASS GIVES FUTURE TEACHERS LESSONS IN DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ On that unforgettable morning, the professors sat
in the Camelot Room of the College of Saint Rose, plotting a new
course to show teachers how to handle death in the age of video
games.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as an omen, the news came of the massacre at Columbine
High School: 15 people killed, including the two gunmen, whose
underground fascination with computer ultraviolence and Nazism was
a living testament to the denial of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was the exclamation point at the end of the
sentence,'' said Donna Burns. ``No sooner had we gotten the course
down on paper than we had this catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Has it all come down this? Death Studies?
</P>
<P>
   Burns and colleague Donna Reittinger would say it has. They are
combining their expertise in education and psychology to teach the
teachers of tomorrow about death and loss, and how to cope with
both in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The professors found Columbine a perfect lesson. They saw in the
mass murder a society where death is alternately romanticized or
hushed up, but seldom understood.
</P>
<P>
   Just as sex education rocked the schools in the 1970s, the
professors see the turn of the millennium as a time to break down
taboos surrounding mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're beginning to discover that death happens,''
Reittinger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the great equalizer,'' added Burns.
</P>
<P>
   The new course, scheduled to begin in the fall, is called
``Coping with Loss in Childhood and Adolescence'' and is designed
as part of the teacher-education curriculum at the College of Saint
Rose, an independent school of 4,000 students in Albany. It's a
more focused and timely look at a topic both professors have dealt
with for more than two decades: Developmental Thanatology. That
mouthful stems from Thanatos, the Greek god of death, and was
popularized with the 1969 publication of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross'
best-seller ``On Death and Dying.''
</P>
<P>
   While science has seen enormous advances in the knowledge of the
mind and body, Reittinger and Burns say the understanding of death
has actually moved backward.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, when children grew up in large extended
families, it was not uncommon to have open-casket wakes in the
house. But as those communities broke down, death became sterilized
and increasingly removed from the day-to-day lives of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``For kids, it's Disney World, sugar and spice and everything
nice, Barbie,'' Reittinger said. ``Unfortunately, children live in
the world with adults and process everything. When adults try to
protect them, children often wind up developmentally arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   The denial of death can be as innocuous as using the euphemism
``passed away'' or as serious as a Web site irreverently urging
browsers to ``Kill 'em all!'' That's what one of the Colorado
gunmen posted about his favorite video game.
</P>
<P>
   Loss can be a death in the family or any of the ``little
deaths'' that come from upheavals like moving to another city,
divorce or the breakup of a romantic relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that if we were to construct the psychological
autopsies of the two boys who did the shooting in Colorado, we
would find major unresolved losses,'' Reittinger said. ``Their
extreme rage was a reaction to those losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns recalled a recent trip to an Albany school to speak to
sixth-graders about a girl with cancer who had missed many days of
class. Like so many others, the teacher was unable to handle
nagging questions about the empty desk the girl left behind. Burns
found that when she posed the subject directly, students peppered
her with questions and faced the topic without fear.
</P>
<P>
   The professors like to talk about such ``teachable moments,''
which can be as simple as a goldfish dying in the class aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a funeral, talk about pets that died and start
talking about what death is,'' Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of doing what most teachers do,'' Reittinger added,
``which is to scoop the fish up, flush it down the toilet and go to
Wal-Mart and buy a new one. They will then try, unsuccessfully, to
convince the class that this is the same old fish.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those who took Reittinger's Thanatology course this spring _
many of them student-teachers _ said the class already has helped
them calm student fears following the violence at Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   Senior education major Ray Parker said he learned to be
reassuring but direct, and never to avoid the topic of death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this class, I definitely wouldn't have known what to
say,'' he said. ``I might have blown everything off.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when teachers are asked to know self-defense and
medications, and are ridiculed for not educating properly,
Reittinger and Burns acknowledge that the job of teaching is not as
easy as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   But they also believe teachers can make a difference. They point
to studies showing that children who have endured horrible losses
can survive if they have one adult who understands them. More often
than not, that person is a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a teacher around who can't tell that story,''
Reittinger said. ``I know we ask teachers to do an impossible job.
But we have to try.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was in Kenya addressing an international conference of
surgeons who treat highway accident victims, Rochelle Sobel
remembers, when her eyes unexpectedly filled with tears. ``I
realized that if Aron hadn't been killed,'' she says, ``he would
probably have been one of those doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Aron Sobel, died in a 1995 bus accident in Turkey that
also took the lives of 22 other people. He was 25.
</P>
<P>
   An honors graduate of the University of Maryland, Aron had just
finished his medical studies and was to begin a residency in
internal medicine at the Boston University Medical Center after his
Turkish vacation. ``He had everything going for him,'' says his
mother, ``except luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck, she says, is something you need a lot of when driving and
riding the highways of many countries. ``The leading cause of death
among healthy Americans traveling abroad is traffic and road
accidents,'' says Sobel, who has made publicizing that grim fact _
and trying to do something about it _ her life's work.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that her son's bus plunged over a cliff because
the driver was operating at a high speed at night on a twisting
mountain road where other fatal accidents had occurred, Sobel
researched Turkish highway accident statistics. She was appalled to
learn that Turkey has one of the highest road death rates in the
world _ almost 20 times that of the United States _ something that
Aron, like most travelers to Turkey, did not know.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of her husband, Dr. Solomon Sobel, she launched
a campaign to alert young Americans to the dangers of road travel
in Turkey. ``But we soon realized that the problem was much broader
and wasn't confined just to young people or to one country,'' she
says, ``and we wanted to try to save lives, not conduct a
vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   She founded the Association for Safe International Road Travel
as a memorial to her son. The nonprofit group lobbies for highway
safety around the world and collects safety data on places where
the hazards are most serious.
</P>
<P>
   The association's publication ``Road Travel Reports'' includes
information on road conditions, driver behavior, seasonal hazards,
traffic safety statistics, and the most dangerous roads and regions
in 60 countries. The group's Web site, htpp://www.asirt.org,
contains travel tips and warnings, along with a sample road travel
report.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny woman _ less than 5 feet _ the 57-year-old Sobel exudes a
powerful sense of mission and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of
time and energy. ``I don't sleep much,'' she admits, ``not since
Aron died.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobel has waged an effective, essentially one-woman battle to
focus public and governmental attention on how the number of
traffic fatalities has reached epidemic proportions in many
developing countries. ``The president of Kenya supports my work,''
she says, ``because he has had two sons killed in road accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not telling people not to travel,'' Sobel says, ``but you
should know before you go.'' As in every year, millions of
Americans will vacation overseas this summer, she notes, and most
will prepare for their trips by researching hotels, planning
itineraries, and checking to see whether they need shots or should
take other medical precautions. ``But they should also find out
what are the safe countries in which to drive _ or travel by public
transportation,'' Sobel adds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Third World countries usually have the worst highway
safety records, says Sobel, road travel can be dangerous in
developed regions, too. ``You expect Europe to be safe, and most of
it is,'' she says, ``but Portugal has the highest highway fatality
rate in Western Europe, much higher than in the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of Sobel's persistence, the US State Department
now includes information about driving conditions and hazards in
its advisories. The data is available on the department's travel
advisory line, at 202-647-5225, or downloaded from its Bureau of
Consular Affairs Web site: htpp://travel.state.gov.
</P>
<P>
   It's often difficult to determine just how dangerous it is to be
on the road when overseas, Sobel says, because many countries,
among them India, Pakistan, and Mexico, keep poor statistics and
furnish little information about accident rates to
statistics-gathering organizations such as the International Road
Federation. ``Aron's death certificate said that he died of
multiple injuries,'' notes Sobel. ``There was nothing about his
being in a bus accident, but that's what really killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   After a recent meeting with Sobel, the State Department
announced that, in order to get a better picture of the problem, US
consulates will begin compiling detailed statistics on the number
of Americans killed or injured in traffic accidents in their
jurisdictions. ``They told me it would cost money to do this, but
what could be more valuable than saving a life?'' she asks. ``I
slept better that night than I had in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Aron's camera was undamaged in the accident and was returned to
his parents with his effects. Among the photos on the roll of film
in it was the last one taken of him.
</P>
<P>
   He's smiling in the photo, a relaxed young man enjoying a
well-earned break. In his hand is the guidebook he used to plan his
trip: ``Let's Go: Greece and Turkey,'' one of the popular budget
travel guides published by the Harvard Student Agencies. The
``Let's Go'' guides, like virtually all others at the time,
contained no warnings about the danger of road travel.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Sobel's calls and letters to their writers and
publishers, most major guidebook series _ ``Let's Go'' among them _
added road safety information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed by the fact that she had suffered a terrible
tragedy and turned it into a cause to make her son's death means
something,'' says Tom Brosnahan of Concord, Mass., author of the
``Lonely Planet'' guide to Turkey, ``and she alerted me to a really
dire situation.'' His guide now warns: ``In the last decade, around
80,000 people have lost their lives and a million have been injured
in traffic accidents. Drive defensively. When traveling by bus give
preference to the better companies with newer equipment,
better-trained drivers and stricter policies about vehicular
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobel runs her group from her home in Potomac, Md. The
association has a few corporate sponsors _ international companies
concerned with the safety of employees traveling overseas _ but
depends for support primarily on individual contributions and the
work of volunteers. Sobel estimates that she has spent about
$40,000 to further the cause, much of it to cover the cost of
attending international road safety conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really get over the death of a child,'' Sobel says,
``and I'll go anywhere and do anything to keep some other mother
from going through the hell I've been through.''

THE OPTIONS FOR MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Imagine the poor boot-licker in the Serbian
government whose lot it is to tell Slobodan Milosevic that the
horrific error that sent US bombs into the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade may complicate diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the
butchery in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the guy saying that one result might be that the
Russians will pull back from their tentative brokering activity; or
that another might be Russian and/or Chinese decisions to use their
vetoes in the UN Security Council or simply to threaten to throw
sand in the peacemaking machinery's gears.
</P>
<P>
   Then imagine Milosevic going nuts with frustration at those
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   From the all-important perspective of the person on whom all the
responsibility for what has happened in the Balkans for the past
decade rests, negotiations, shuttle diplomacy, and political
maneuvering are everything right now.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way Milosevic can avoid the proper
consequences for his criminal actions _ his overthrow or his
incarceration for life _ and that is by arranging a deal that at
least enables him to claim to his complicit populace that Kosovo is
still Serbia's, if not that there is some remaining manifestation
of that control, preferably one that fudges the security guarantees
for returning Kosovar refugees just enough to keep many of them
from returning.
</P>
<P>
   For that to be possible, the dictator needs the Russians, the
Chinese, and the UN to help arrange such a deal as quickly as
possible, not pouting over a bombing mistake that took lives he
could give a hoot about.
</P>
<P>
   Without that diplomacy, all Milosevic has to look forward to is
a continuous, relentless assault from the air on his forces in
Kosovo and his strategic foundation in Serbia proper that has
already hurt him badly and can only hurt him far worse if it
continues to intensify.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it does not appear that Milosevic has much to fear from
the Russians. Another high-level US mission to Moscow to help them
in their work is still on for this week. Around here, Russians are
quietly passing the word that their business will go on.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese situation will remain clouded, however, at least
until the semi-hysteria directed at Americans there plays itself
out for better or worse. Some US officials suspect the Beijing
regime is trying to outflank its genuinely anti-US internal rivals;
others worry that the situation could get out of control. The State
Department's warning to Americans not to travel to China for the
moment was at least an ominous signal of how much is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis in Kosovo does not appear to be involved. The
Chinese already have suffered a diplomatic black eye by
irresponsibly vetoing last January the UN resolution re-authorizing
its protective presence in continually threatened Macedonia. The
reason was Macedonia's recognition of Taiwan _ a classic example of
how relentlessly self-interested Chinese diplomacy can be; however,
Americans should be aware that had the mission retained its UN
character and not been taken over by NATO, those three American
soldiers would never have been kidnapped and beaten by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Chinese diplomats have avoided any talk about
their UN responsibility in the venting that has followed the loss
of Chinese lives in Belgrade. Cautiously, US officials expect that
stance to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic sure hopes so, and there's the irony. Negotiations are
his way out, and the danger is that they could lead to something
less than peace, and a lot less than justice.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the true hawks on this issue _ Democratic Senator Joe
Biden of Delaware, joined recently by Republican presidential
candidate John McCain _ disdain deals. They'd go to Belgrade, with
ground troops, to cut this cancer out of Europe once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point.
</P>
<P>
   The only justifiable counter is that the slaughter and mayhem
could end a lot sooner if the Russians behave responsibly and in
their own interest, and if they and the Chinese cooperate in the
establishment of an equally responsible UN role.
</P>
<P>
   The details, however, require negotiation, and that produces
Milosevic's last hope, and thus his fervent wish that the diplomacy
not be sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   NATO obviously needs a good, up-to-date map of Belgrade. But it
also needs to stick to its basic aims, as well as to continue and
intensify the only pressure Milosevic understands.

MEDICAL RESEARCHER QUIT AMID SEXUAL HARASSMENT INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When world-renowned epidemiologist Dr. Charles H.
Hennekens resigned his appointments at Harvard Medical School and
Brigham and Women's Hospital in March, he cited ``personal and
family illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennekens, who led the study that determined that an aspirin a
day cuts the risk of some types of heart attacks, planned to move
to Florida to be with his ailing mother, his lawyer told reporters.
In a terse statement issued in response to press inquiries, the
Brigham and Harvard declined to comment about the departure because
of ``issues of employee confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   What neither Hennekens nor the institutions disclosed was that
the doctor's resignation followed allegations that he sexually
harassed more than a dozen women who worked under his supervision,
according to three sources familiar with the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said the complaints were investigated by lawyers
from both the hospital and Harvard. All three sources worked with
Hennekens at the hospital's Division of Preventive Medicine, and
one of them says she was victimized by him.
</P>
<P>
   Hennekens left his position at the hospital six weeks after the
women told their stories to the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Contacted last week, both Harvard and the Brigham said they
would have nothing further to say about the resignation.
Hennekens's lawyer, Joel Kozol, would not answer questions, but
issued this statement from his client:
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's world, allegations of sexual harassment are easily
made and difficult to disprove. When they are made by people who
are unwilling to be identified, they are not worthy of response,
much less publication. Since the Globe has chosen to publish
anonymous allegations, I will state only that I have never in my
life sexually harassed anyone in the Division or anywhere else.
Those who know me know this to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   However, women who worked with Hennekens said that over a period
of several years, he subjected them to unwanted advances and other
inappropriate behavior, including questions about their personal
lives and in one instance, allegedly asking his secretary to order
specialized underwear for him.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said many of the women who worked with Hennekens
feared him and remained silent about the alleged sexual harassment
because they were concerned the doctor might hurt their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrified of Charlie,'' said a female researcher who
asserted that her career was harmed after she spurned advances by
Hennekens. ``He is a very powerful man with a broad-based ability
to harm people. He is connected to all of the power brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   The sources agreed to discuss the allegations against Hennekens
only if their identities were protected. They said they were
convinced Hennekens would retaliate against them, even though he
has left Harvard and the Brigham. They said they wanted to discuss
what happened out of concern that Hennekens was considering
appointments at other universities and might behave in a similar
way there.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, officials at two medical schools, Oxford University in
England and the University of Miami in Florida, told the Globe they
were engaged in preliminary employment discussions with the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The twice-divorced, 56-year-old Hennekens is widely considered a
superstar in the medical research field, and his cachet was such
that he was able to attract millions of dollars in grants for his
work.
</P>
<P>
   Findings from the three long-term studies he oversaw until March
resulted in international news coverage and changed the way some
diseases are treated and prevented. Along with the study that found
that the risk of men suffering a first heart attack was reduced by
taking an aspirin a day, Hennekens's team also found that birth
control pills don't raise the risk of heart attacks, coffee is not
a health hazard, and low-fat diets don't prevent breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as editor or co-editor at many of the leading
medical research journals, including the American Journal of
Preventive Medicine and the Annals of Epidemiology. At Harvard, he
was the Eugene Braunwald Professor of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, several of the 120 employees of the Division of
Preventive Medicine, began discussing Hennekens's especially harsh
treatment of a female researcher, the sources said. As the
discussion unfolded, some current and former employees began to
share stories of harassment and untoward sexual advances by
Hennekens, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the ongoing treatment of the female staffer and the
realization that the alleged harassment was widespread, a group of
lab employees decided to inform hospital officials at the beginning
of this year of the allegations against Hennekens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a particularly egregious situation,'' said one of the
sources. ``It was very familiar to those of us who had been
involved with him and not surprising. That stimulated people to go
forward, partly in support of this other person, and also there
being a need for some justice.''
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard and Brigham lawyers interviewed many of the lab
employees, Hennekens was confronted with their allegations, the
sources said. At this point, he was only allowed to return to the
lab with an escort from the hospital administration, the sources
said. He returned once and was not seen at the lab again. Six weeks
after he was confronted, the news of Hennekens's resignation was
made public.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said some women alleged Hennekens retaliated against
them if they rejected his advances, and they suffered unfair and
unwarranted attacks on their work. In some cases, the sources said,
women complained they were subjected to criticisms of their
personal lives. Some women said their roles in major research
activities were minimized.
</P>
<P>
   Other women complained only of inappropriate sexual advances by
Hennekens, and said they did not suffer professionally. Some of the
complaints were made by former staffers who said the behavior dated
back several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would make a sexual advance to someone or in some cases,
like my situation, it was an explicit sexual proposition in which
the sexual nature of his request was completely clear,'' said the
woman who alleges she was victimized by Hennekens. She declined to
discuss specifics of his actions, concerned he would be able to
identify her. ``I was extremely fearful of the consequences of
rejecting him. From that point forward my work suffered. He blocked
whatever I tried to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Hennekens was so powerful _ and could literally make or
break a young researcher's career _ the sources said the women who
worked for him were reluctant to complain about his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   However, a secretary who worked for Hennekens obtained a
temporary restraining order against him and last year filed a
lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court alleging he engaged in
inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was dismissed by a judge after a trial in which the
secretary represented herself. Hennekens, in an affidavit filed in
the case, denied all of the charges and his lawyer said the lawsuit
was baseless. His lawyer also said a judge refused to issue a
permanent restraining order in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary, Wren M. Fournier, alleged Hennekens harassed her,
even driving by her home after work hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe Charles Hennekens to be dangerous and request
protection in every manner against him,'' she wrote in court
papers. In a separate document, she said, ``I am still afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   She said other women in the office also feared Hennekens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I observed inappropriate behavior . . . primarily leering at
other female staff members and their subsequent avoidance'' of
Hennekens, she wrote in her affidavit seeking the restraining
order.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, Fournier said she received an ``alarming
report'' that a female employee was being sexually harassed by
Hennekens. ``Hennekens will not take no for an answer,'' Fournier
said the other woman told her.
</P>
<P>
   Fournier also alleged Hennekens attempted to confide details of
his personal life to her, including information about his second
divorce. She also said he had personal items mailed to his office,
items she had to open as part of her duties. In one instance, she
was required to open a box that included specialized girdle-type
underwear he ordered. Later, he allegedly required her to fill out
an order form for Manshape brand underpants. ``I was humiliated,''
she said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Fournier declined to comment on her lawsuit or experience at the
lab.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving his positions in Boston, Hennekens has talked to
at least two other institutions about jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lawrence Gardner, chairman of the Department of Medicine at
the University of Miami Medical School, said he had had
``preliminary discussions'' with Hennekens, but added it was
``premature'' to say if he would accept a position at the school.
``He is obviously a giant in the field,'' Gardner said of
Hennekens. ``I would be thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Peto, an Oxford professor and noted epidemiologist,
confirmed there has been discussion of Hennekens taking a position
at Oxford. He was unsure of the status of those talks. When asked
why he thought Hennekens resigned his positions in Boston, Peto
said, ``I still don't know what this whole thing is about.''

HE'S THE CANADIAN ELVIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When you look at Martin Fontaine, with his short hair and
youthful appearance, the last person you might think of is Elvis
Presley. But that's before his two-hour makeup session that adds a
wig, sideburns, and a shading process that cleverly creates a
curling lip. Then when he steps on the stage at Le Capitole de
Quebec and starts to sing and shake, the crowd explodes because,
well, they're seeing Elvis.
</P>
<P>
   Fontaine has appeared on stage at the Quebec City hotel for four
summers now, attracting a total of 300,000 spectators with a
hip-swinging performance that includes 40 Elvis songs interspersed
with actual film footage and news clips and is accompanied by a
10-member chorus and band. The result is a re-creation of the
King's musical career, from the giddy beginning to the devastating
ending. This year, the show will run June 3 to Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Don't call Fontaine an Elvis impersonator, though. ``Not a
chance,'' he says. ``I interpret, rather than imitate, his music,
which enables me to capture the feeling and, well, the frenzy that
he created.''
</P>
<P>
   The performer continues: ``After the show each night, though, I
go back to being Martin Fontaine.'' A good thing, too. A couple of
high-energy hours involving four changes of wigs and 16 switches of
costumes should be enough Elvis for any one man.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
They couldn't agree more: Nova Scotia and Massachusetts have the
same state/provincial flower: the mayflower, or trailing arbutus. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fun, fun, fun: There is a theme park of sorts in Hokkaido, Japan,
called Canadian World. Its principal attraction revolves around the
fictional Anne of Green Gables of Prince Edward Island. &QL;

speedily dub 60-90 movies into French and sometimes English. Most
of the movies are from Hollywood. &QL;

Spacious: The field at Toronto's Skydome is big enough to hold 516
African elephants. Or 751 Indian elephants. Or eight Boeing 747s.
Or the Roman Colosseum. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Skinny: A Vancouver structure claims the title of world's thinnest
office building. It's a mere 6 feet wide. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Glub: All of New Brunswick was once under the sea. But that was 370
million years ago. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Freebie: Oh to be on Prince Edward Island on a sunny summer (or
fall, or spring) day. For a vacation planning kit that includes a
detailed visitors' guide and more than $275 in coupons, call

THE OPTIONS FOR MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Imagine the poor boot-licker in the Serbian
government whose lot it is to tell Slobodan Milosevic that the
horrific error that sent US bombs into the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade may complicate diplomatic efforts to bring an end to the
butchery in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the guy saying that one result might be that the
Russians will pull back from their tentative brokering activity; or
that another might be Russian and/or Chinese decisions to use their
vetoes in the UN Security Council or simply to threaten to throw
sand in the peacemaking machinery's gears.
</P>
<P>
   Then imagine Milosevic going nuts with frustration at those
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   From the all-important perspective of the person on whom all the
responsibility for what has happened in the Balkans for the past
decade rests, negotiations, shuttle diplomacy, and political
maneuvering are everything right now.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way Milosevic can avoid the proper
consequences for his criminal actions _ his overthrow or his
incarceration for life _ and that is by arranging a deal that at
least enables him to claim to his complicit populace that Kosovo is
still Serbia's, if not that there is some remaining manifestation
of that control, preferably one that fudges the security guarantees
for returning Kosovar refugees just enough to keep many of them
from returning.
</P>
<P>
   For that to be possible, the dictator needs the Russians, the
Chinese, and the UN to help arrange such a deal as quickly as
possible, not pouting over a bombing mistake that took lives he
could give a hoot about.
</P>
<P>
   Without that diplomacy, all Milosevic has to look forward to is
a continuous, relentless assault from the air on his forces in
Kosovo and his strategic foundation in Serbia proper that has
already hurt him badly and can only hurt him far worse if it
continues to intensify.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it does not appear that Milosevic has much to fear from
the Russians. Another high-level US mission to Moscow to help them
in their work is still on for this week. Around here, Russians are
quietly passing the word that their business will go on.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese situation will remain clouded, however, at least
until the semi-hysteria directed at Americans there plays itself
out for better or worse. Some US officials suspect the Beijing
regime is trying to outflank its genuinely anti-US internal rivals;
others worry that the situation could get out of control. The State
Department's warning to Americans not to travel to China for the
moment was at least an ominous signal of how much is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   But the crisis in Kosovo does not appear to be involved. The
Chinese already have suffered a diplomatic black eye by
irresponsibly vetoing last January the UN resolution re-authorizing
its protective presence in continually threatened Macedonia. The
reason was Macedonia's recognition of Taiwan _ a classic example of
how relentlessly self-interested Chinese diplomacy can be; however,
Americans should be aware that had the mission retained its UN
character and not been taken over by NATO, those three American
soldiers would never have been kidnapped and beaten by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, Chinese diplomats have avoided any talk about
their UN responsibility in the venting that has followed the loss
of Chinese lives in Belgrade. Cautiously, US officials expect that
stance to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic sure hopes so, and there's the irony. Negotiations are
his way out, and the danger is that they could lead to something
less than peace, and a lot less than justice.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the true hawks on this issue _ Democratic Senator Joe
Biden of Delaware, joined recently by Republican presidential
candidate John McCain _ disdain deals. They'd go to Belgrade, with
ground troops, to cut this cancer out of Europe once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point.
</P>
<P>
   The only justifiable counter is that the slaughter and mayhem
could end a lot sooner if the Russians behave responsibly and in
their own interest, and if they and the Chinese cooperate in the
establishment of an equally responsible UN role.
</P>
<P>
   The details, however, require negotiation, and that produces
Milosevic's last hope, and thus his fervent wish that the diplomacy
not be sidetracked.
</P>
<P>
   NATO obviously needs a good, up-to-date map of Belgrade. But it
also needs to stick to its basic aims, as well as to continue and
intensify the only pressure Milosevic understands.
</P>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was in Kenya addressing an international conference of
surgeons who treat highway accident victims, Rochelle Sobel
remembers, when her eyes unexpectedly filled with tears. ``I
realized that if Aron hadn't been killed,'' she says, ``he would
probably have been one of those doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Her son, Aron Sobel, died in a 1995 bus accident in Turkey that
also took the lives of 22 other people. He was 25.
</P>
<P>
   An honors graduate of the University of Maryland, Aron had just
finished his medical studies and was to begin a residency in
internal medicine at the Boston University Medical Center after his
Turkish vacation. ``He had everything going for him,'' says his
mother, ``except luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck, she says, is something you need a lot of when driving and
riding the highways of many countries. ``The leading cause of death
among healthy Americans traveling abroad is traffic and road
accidents,'' says Sobel, who has made publicizing that grim fact _
and trying to do something about it _ her life's work.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that her son's bus plunged over a cliff because
the driver was operating at a high speed at night on a twisting
mountain road where other fatal accidents had occurred, Sobel
researched Turkish highway accident statistics. She was appalled to
learn that Turkey has one of the highest road death rates in the
world _ almost 20 times that of the United States _ something that
Aron, like most travelers to Turkey, did not know.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of her husband, Dr. Solomon Sobel, she launched
a campaign to alert young Americans to the dangers of road travel
in Turkey. ``But we soon realized that the problem was much broader
and wasn't confined just to young people or to one country,'' she
says, ``and we wanted to try to save lives, not conduct a
vendetta.''
</P>
<P>
   She founded the Association for Safe International Road Travel
as a memorial to her son. The nonprofit group lobbies for highway
safety around the world and collects safety data on places where
the hazards are most serious.
</P>
<P>
   The association's publication ``Road Travel Reports'' includes
information on road conditions, driver behavior, seasonal hazards,
traffic safety statistics, and the most dangerous roads and regions
in 60 countries. The group's Web site, htpp://www.asirt.org,
contains travel tips and warnings, along with a sample road travel
report.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny woman _ less than 5 feet _ the 57-year-old Sobel exudes a
powerful sense of mission and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of
time and energy. ``I don't sleep much,'' she admits, ``not since
Aron died.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobel has waged an effective, essentially one-woman battle to
focus public and governmental attention on how the number of
traffic fatalities has reached epidemic proportions in many
developing countries. ``The president of Kenya supports my work,''
she says, ``because he has had two sons killed in road accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not telling people not to travel,'' Sobel says, ``but you
should know before you go.'' As in every year, millions of
Americans will vacation overseas this summer, she notes, and most
will prepare for their trips by researching hotels, planning
itineraries, and checking to see whether they need shots or should
take other medical precautions. ``But they should also find out
what are the safe countries in which to drive _ or travel by public
transportation,'' Sobel adds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Third World countries usually have the worst highway
safety records, says Sobel, road travel can be dangerous in
developed regions, too. ``You expect Europe to be safe, and most of
it is,'' she says, ``but Portugal has the highest highway fatality
rate in Western Europe, much higher than in the US.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of Sobel's persistence, the US State Department
now includes information about driving conditions and hazards in
its advisories. The data is available on the department's travel
advisory line, at 202-647-5225, or downloaded from its Bureau of
Consular Affairs Web site: htpp://travel.state.gov.
</P>
<P>
   It's often difficult to determine just how dangerous it is to be
on the road when overseas, Sobel says, because many countries,
among them India, Pakistan, and Mexico, keep poor statistics and
furnish little information about accident rates to
statistics-gathering organizations such as the International Road
Federation. ``Aron's death certificate said that he died of
multiple injuries,'' notes Sobel. ``There was nothing about his
being in a bus accident, but that's what really killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   After a recent meeting with Sobel, the State Department
announced that, in order to get a better picture of the problem, US
consulates will begin compiling detailed statistics on the number
of Americans killed or injured in traffic accidents in their
jurisdictions. ``They told me it would cost money to do this, but
what could be more valuable than saving a life?'' she asks. ``I
slept better that night than I had in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Aron's camera was undamaged in the accident and was returned to
his parents with his effects. Among the photos on the roll of film
in it was the last one taken of him.
</P>
<P>
   He's smiling in the photo, a relaxed young man enjoying a
well-earned break. In his hand is the guidebook he used to plan his
trip: ``Let's Go: Greece and Turkey,'' one of the popular budget
travel guides published by the Harvard Student Agencies. The
``Let's Go'' guides, like virtually all others at the time,
contained no warnings about the danger of road travel.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Sobel's calls and letters to their writers and
publishers, most major guidebook series _ ``Let's Go'' among them _
added road safety information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed by the fact that she had suffered a terrible
tragedy and turned it into a cause to make her son's death means
something,'' says Tom Brosnahan of Concord, Mass., author of the
``Lonely Planet'' guide to Turkey, ``and she alerted me to a really
dire situation.'' His guide now warns: ``In the last decade, around
80,000 people have lost their lives and a million have been injured
in traffic accidents. Drive defensively. When traveling by bus give
preference to the better companies with newer equipment,
better-trained drivers and stricter policies about vehicular
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobel runs her group from her home in Potomac, Md. The
association has a few corporate sponsors _ international companies
concerned with the safety of employees traveling overseas _ but
depends for support primarily on individual contributions and the
work of volunteers. Sobel estimates that she has spent about
$40,000 to further the cause, much of it to cover the cost of
attending international road safety conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never really get over the death of a child,'' Sobel says,
``and I'll go anywhere and do anything to keep some other mother
from going through the hell I've been through.''
</P>

   ROSEMARY-BUSH (Undated) _ I get a bad case of rosemary
chauvinism in the spring. My motivation couldn't be culinary; I
pinch little sprigs my own rosemary bush all year round and,
traditionally, rosemary is teamed with fall and wintery dishes.
Still, when I cart new basil and chervil, oregano, parsley and
thyme onto the terrace every spring, I fuss with them briefly and
then dote on my rosemary. Next to the fragile baby annuals, the
perennial rosemary is so valiant, thriving in the perpetual fumes
of trucks and cars and forgiving my erratic attentions. By Molly
O'Neill.

   URBAN-HERBS (New York) _ Every spring, when the urge to grow
erupts, New Yorkers carry home pots of fresh herbs, imagining a
garden on the windowsill where fresh basil and dill can be plucked
with abandon. And every summer both hopes and herbs wither and die.
The natural inclination is always to blame a black thumb. But herbs

SMALL-TOWN AIDS PATIENT FINDS MIXTURE OF FEAR AND KINDNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photos available on the Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROGER CROTEAU  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ Robert Konkel has seen both sides of life
as an AIDS patient in a small town.
</P>
<P>
   He's felt the cold sting of discrimination and fear, like the
time a pharmacy worker brushed the pen he used into the trash
without touching it. He has endured hour-long ambulance rides to
another city because of the lack of specialized medical care and
other services in his home town.
</P>
<P>
   He's also seen the good side of small town life, with strangers
volunteering to drive him the 25 miles to San Antonio for medical
appointments and a church he'd never attended raising $6,000 to
help pay for his medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I expected to accept it turned their back on me,
and people I never would have expected to embrace me have
wholeheartedly supported me,'' Konkel said.
</P>
<P>
   The stigma of AIDS as a disease to be ashamed of and hide lives
on in many small towns across Texas, as does the close knit
community life that can offer heartwarming support to people who
fall on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dichotomy that torments many HIV-positive people in
rural areas, driving some away from their homes, keeping others
desperate to hide their condition, while allowing others to live
openly and use their experience to educate others about AIDS
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Konkel, 40, has chosen to work tirelessly to try to slow the
spread of the disease in New Braunfels and other towns, a deathbed
promise to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   A gay man who said he was once a drug user, Konkel has given
speeches on rural AIDS intervention at national AIDS conventions in
San Francisco, handed out literature and condoms at parks and truck
stops, and spoken to any group that will listen. Now he has been
nominated to the Ryan White Council, which makes decisions about
what anti-AIDS programs get funded.
</P>
<P>
   Konkel said he would bring the needs of rural AIDS patients to
the attention of national experts if his nomination is successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rural intervention is basically being ignored,'' said Konkel,
a long-time resident of this South Texas town of 33,000 people.
``That is my intent on trying to get on the council.''
</P>
<P>
   Comal County, of which New Braunfels is the seat, has had 4
reported AIDS cases and 23 AIDS-related deaths, with six new cases
in 1998, according to the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Texas ranks fourth _ behind California, New York and Florida _
in the number of AIDS cases reported. As the end of March, the
state had 49,636 known cases and 27,480 deaths resulting from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS is an affliction in which the human immunodeficiency virus
weakens the immune system, subjecting the body to serious
infection. AIDS is most often spread through sexual contact,
sharing contaminated needles and infected blood products.
</P>
<P>
   Health professionals who work with HIV-positive people agree
that patients living in rural areas or small cities face special
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of the illness being exposed is often more acute than
that of AIDS patients in large cities. Small town gossip and the
stigma associated with AIDS makes the idea of living openly with
the disease unthinkable to many.
</P>
<P>
   Konkel said he has never regretted the night in 1995 he told the
City Council he had AIDS and begged the mayor to set up a Council
on AIDS, a step never taken.
</P>
<P>
   But he understands why others jealously guard their secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in rural areas with AIDS do anything to hide it,'' he
said. ``It never gets listed as a cause of death in obituaries.
People die of a disease that has no name. But the problem is out
here, that's why I make myself so visible.''
</P>
<P>
   Konkel said the support he has encountered, from the
fund-raisers to the network of friends and supporters who have
driven him to his frequent doctor's visits in San Antonio, can
largely be attributed to who he is. From a well-known local family,
Konkel had been active for years in several charities. He had a
deep well of goodwill built up.

</P>
<P>
   Others are not so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went public in 1990 and as soon as that happened my son
became a target in the school system,'' said Laurie Lee, an AIDS
activist from the Corpus Christi area who asked that her last name
not be used. ``He was beaten. It ripped my heart out every time it
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   At age 7, Laurie Lee's son was taunted by classmates who changed
the words to the theme song from the Addams Family television show
to ``The AIDS Family.'' They called his mother a whore, and he
often came home bloody after the ensuing fights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so traumatic it made me run,'' said Laurie Lee, who
acquired the AIDS virus from her ex-husband. ``It made me teach my
children to lie and hide things.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she ran from Corpus Christi, a city of 275,000 people,
to New Braunfels to be near her family, but left after just a
couple of months. Although she said her children were beaten and
taunted in Corpus Christi, she still felt she could be more open
about her condition there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the World AIDS Day service (in New Braunfels) and
everyone talked about the fear, not being able to talk about it. It
was the weirdest feeling. I felt so out of place because there was
so much fear and I had not felt it for so long,'' she said. ``The
whole atmosphere was different.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality is so important in rural areas, AIDS patients'
identities are even kept from other AIDS patients, said Renee
Cantu. Cantu, an AIDS educator, used to work for a Rural AIDS
Services Program in the rural counties surrounding Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Cantu's job was taking AIDS patients to medical
appointments in Austin. Often she would pick up a patient and drive
right past another patient's house, only to return to later in the
day to drive the second patient to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might think it would make sense to drive them together,''
she said. ``But you can't do that. They don't want someone from a
neighboring town to know they have AIDS, even another AIDS
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Cantu said her rural patients were all-too-familiar with ``those
small town scandals that everyone talks about.''
</P>
<P>
   The desire for anonymity makes it more difficult to find clients
for the Rural Aids Service Program, said Assistant HIV Director
Stephanie Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are kind of in a Catch-22,'' Taylor said. ``We want to find
the people who need our services, but we don't want to be too
visible in these areas, because we don't want discrimination to
occur. We keep a low profile.''

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ Forging a powerful union, Russia
and China called Tuesday for an immediate halt to NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia, in a move that threatened to scuttle U.S.
efforts to win United Nations support for sending military
peacekeepers to the embattled province of Kosovo. NATO dismissed
the pleas of Beijing and Moscow and forged ahead with an
intensifying and escalating air campaign that winds up its seventh
inconclusive week on Wednesday. (Deans, Cox News Service). 30.

   KOSOVO-REFUGEES _ KUKES, Albania _ As the tide of refugees
continues to flow into here from neighboring Kosovo province,
frustrated humanitarian aid officials struggled Tuesday to increase
its ebb by asking for volunteers to move to southern Albania.
Meanwhile, their counterparts in Macedonia appeared to meet with
some success as Kosovo refugees from crowded camps in Macedonia
began to move to a new camp near the southern Albanian town of

   MEDICARE _ The chairman of the failed Medicare reform commission
Tuesday lashed out at his fellow Democrats, charging that many of
them want a campaign issue more than real reform. ``There are
clearly those who don't want to do anything on this and use this as
a political issue,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who chaired the
recent Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. (Lipman,

   WASTE-HUD _ If the third time wasn't a charm, perhaps the fourth

its longest-running housing disasters. Clifton Towers, just a short
drive from the U.S. Capitol and a symbol of subsidized housing gone
awry, is being offered to private developers for $1 plus a federal
promise of $8.2 million for renovations . Over the last 30 years,
three landlords allowed it to deteriorate into a crime and rat
infested neighborhood hazard. (Malone, Cox News Service).

Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. against CBS over King's ``I Have A

University in Atlanta, whose parents died in the 1996 ValuJet
crash, has returned to the Everglades to chronicle the slow rise of

A dedication and memorial ceremony coinciding with the third

   OHIO-POORKIDS _ COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Amanda was destined to be a
school statistic. Another example of how child poverty shoves
students to the back of the classroom. Her mom is poor, unemployed
and has moved the 4-year-old to different low-income apartments
around Dayton, Ohio three times in the last eight months. Only the
efforts of Dayton City Schools Head Start program kept the girl
from falling completely out of the system. But Amanda is one of the
lucky children, according to a report issued Monday by the
Children's Defense Fund in Ohio. The report, Helping Children
Learn, says 40 percent of Ohio newborns start life likely to live
in poverty and perform in the lower half of their class at school.

   FLA-WILDFIRES _ PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Nearly four weeks after a
most unwelcome visitor arrived, a dead calm remains settled over
Franklin Street. Acres of pine- and palmetto-studded forests turned
to kindling as the blaze, whipped by 30-mph winds, blackened more
than 700 acres between Florida's Turnpike and Interstate 95 and
caused some $4.5 million in damages. Although at least 42 homes
were destroyed citywide, few streets were hit as hard as Franklin _
a once-bustling verdant corridor now flecked with barren cement
slabs, denuded forests and Dumpsters filled with broken bits of
lives. ``I've never seen Kosovo, but I can imagine what the place
looks like after this,'' said David Keirs, whose large home on
Franklin was one of nine spared. ``We built here because of the
lush trees and the wildlife. Now I hate to open the blinds in the
morning.'' (Lane, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   BAXTER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes has been
taking his sweet time making a slew of major board appointments
he's had on the table since the end of the legislative session,
submitting his applicants to thorough background checks and trying
the patience of various interest groups, as he laps the state
signing all the laws he got passed. Given the general anticipation
this has created, it was a little curious that when Barnes
announced his appointments for eight of the 11 state Board of
Education seats, he did so by fax and not with a photo-op press
conference. No matter, though: With the governor moving education
to the top of his priority list for the next year, the board
members should have plenty of time under the lights. (Baxter,

   ISRAEL-SECURITY _ JERUSALEM _ Try as he might, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been able to get any momentum
this election season behind his hardline stand on security and
confrontation against the Arabs. In a biting setback Tuesday, the
Israeli supreme court(CQ) squashed an order by Netanyahu to close
offices of the PLO in Jerusalem. Netanyahu's aides say the issue
had nothing to do with the elections or Netanyahu's slide in the
polls. But, he has allowed the office to function during his three
years in office until this week, when opponents said he was looking
to score points on his defense of Jerusalem. In 1996, a series of
suicide bombings were key in turning voters to the hard-line
Netanyahu. This year, there have been no major attacks. The prime
minister has resorted to showing video of the old bus bombings in
his campaign commercials. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 20.

   ROSEMARY-BUSH (Undated) _ I get a bad case of rosemary
chauvinism in the spring. My motivation couldn't be culinary; I

Still, when I cart new basil and chervil, oregano, parsley and
thyme onto the terrace every spring, I fuss with them briefly and
then dote on my rosemary. Next to the fragile baby annuals, the
perennial rosemary is so valiant, thriving in the perpetual fumes

DOWNTOWN HOUSTON GETS A MAKEOVER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICK LYMAN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, or even two, taking visitors for a night on the
town would have been to court absurdity, unless your goal was to
get them home early. Downtown Houston was a place where
well-dressed people worked in their tunnel--connected,
air-conditioned cocoons until about 5:30 p.m. and then beat feet
back to the suburbs, leaving behind a dark, empty grid of glass
canyons. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But downtown Houston _ at least the north end of it, spreading
out from the Bayou Place development and its adjacent Theater
District toward the renovated Rice Hotel and easing onward toward
the baseball stadium that will replace the Astrodome next season _
is a very different place now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's practically, almost ... well why not say it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's cool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who haven't been downtown for a year almost
don't recognize it,'' said Rasheed Rafaey, owner of Tasca, one of
the popular new restaurants in the northern end of downtown, which
is known, inevitably, as NoDo. ``You had zero street traffic a year
and a half ago after 6 p.m.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The amazingly rapid resurgence of downtown is only one of the
major changes that have overtaken the nation's fourth-largest city
and perhaps its unlikeliest tourist destination. Kemah Boardwalk, a
new waterfront development on Galveston Bay about a half-hour's
drive southeast of downtown, has provided another fresh
destination, especially for families.
</P>
<P>
   And the city's justly celebrated cultural scene continues to
grow, with recent additions to the Menil Collection and several
other Houston museums, as well as a major wing about to be finished
at the Museum of Fine Arts. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Menil, one of the most beguiling private collections in the
United States, has opened a new exhibition space called Richmond
Hall, two blocks south of the original galleries, where a permanent
exhibition by Dan Flavin of blue, green, pink and yellow
fluorescent tubes runs along 125 feet of wall space in a former
grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the Byzantine Fresco Chapel, completed in 1997, is home
to 13th-century frescoes from Cyprus; the chapel, a modern
structure of gray limestone and concrete, won an award for
outstanding architecture this year from the American Institute of
Architects. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Fine Arts' Audrey Jones Beck Building is set to
open in March, 2000, during the museum's centennial year,
stretching across two city blocks with 85,400 square feet of
additional gallery space. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the biggest beneficiary of the city's downtown
revival was the Theater District, the half-dozen blocks around
Jones Plaza at the corner of Texas and Louisiana Avenues. The urban
square is itself scheduled to be renovated and relandscaped soon.
The plaza is surrounded on three sides by the city's premier
performing arts centers: Jesse Jones Hall for the Performing Arts,
home of the Houston Symphony, the concrete castle of the Alley
Theater Company, the city's most prominent theatrical group, and
the towering, red brick Wortham Center, home to the Houston Opera,
the Houston Ballet and other companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before downtown's renaissance, it was not uncommon for people to
come here for performances, then get out immediately. But after
Bayou Place, a combination of movie theaters, restaurants and
sidewalk cafes, was opened in the former convention center on Jones
Plaza a couple of years ago, more and more theatergoers began to
arrive early for a drink or dinner, or stay after the show, and the
whole plaza area shifted into a nighttime bustle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Angelika Film Center and Cafe anchors the southeast corner
of Bayou Place, with an eight-screen movie complex offering art
films and high-end commercial fare (an offshoot of the Angelika in
lower Manhattan, in New York) and a popular lobby cafe offering
pastas, sandwiches, a particularly delicious curried chicken salad
and numerous wines by the glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Bayou Place's northeast corner is the Sake Lounge, an almost
instant hit when it opened a couple of years ago, with its
combination of high-tech decor, sidewalk cafe tables and whimsical
Japanese fare (the spider roll is a sushi-style hand roll made with
soft-shell crabs). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there are others. Mingalone's Italian Bar and Grill is on
Bayou Place's northern side, Slick Willie's pool parlor is
upstairs, and it was announced recently that the Hard Rock Cafe was
thinking of moving from southwest Houston to Bayou Place.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for something more casual can try another popular
downtown spot, the Cabo Mix Mex Grill, just a couple of blocks east
of Jones Plaza, which offers a lot of the usual grilled meats and
Tex Mex fare to a sometimes overly convivial crowd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The appearance in the last year or so of dozens of new housing
units, many of them New York-style lofts in previously empty
vintage buildings, as well as luxury condominium projects like the
renovation of the former Rice Hotel on Texas Avenue three blocks
east of Jones Plaza, added something that downtown Houston has been
missing for generations _ a stable residential base to help support
the restaurants and shops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More are on the way. Six new downtown condo and loft projects
with nearly 400 units are expected to open in the next year or so.
Within a few blocks of the Theater District, where once was
darkness, are about a dozen restaurants and bars, including the
Hogg Grill, a stately cafe serving traditional steak-and-chops
fare, and Sambucca, a Mediterranean restaurant and jazz club in the
former Rice Hotel. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Downtown Management District counts 29 restaurants
and nightclubs that have opened in the last couple of years in
downtown Houston and 16 more set to open in the next few months.
Only a handful of these offer fast-food fare, and an astonishing
number are stylish, high-end restaurants, like Tasca. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rafaey, who is also chairman of the Retail and Club Subcommittee
of the downtown historical district, remembers how difficult it was
for him to find investors in his planned downtown restaurant in
early 1997. Bayou Place was in the works, along with the renovation
of the Rice Hotel, but the announcement had not yet been made that
the Houston Astros would move to a new downtown stadium for the
2000 season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard sell for the first six to eight months,'' he
said. ``People thought I was crazy..'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tasca, offering a combination of tapas and New American cooking,
opened in June of 1998. By that fall, he said, downtown had really
begun to take off. With its high ceilings, brick walls and large
pieces of contemporary art, Tasca resembles a Manhattan cafe more
than a Houston restaurant. On one recent evening, a throng of
smartly dressed young people clustered around the long bar while
vivacious waiters served and entertained those seated in the room's
booths and tables. Live jazz played in the background. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The late-night side of downtown's resurgence has been the
seemingly overnight influx of the city's cutting-edge nightclub
scene from the Montrose District, about a mile to the southwest,
and the so-called Richmond Avenue Strip, several miles further to
the west. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Typical, at least for one of the upscale places, is the Spy
Club, two levels of DJ-driven disco music and lavishly decorated
bars and dance floors that draws an overflowing crowd of
20-somethings most weekend nights. One recent evening the throng
included well-dressed young businessmen chattering into cell phones
(in the few quiet corners where the thumping music made that
possible) and young women in abbreviated dresses or astonishingly
ornate costumes (one group wore skin-hugging black body suits and
bright red wigs).
</P>
<P>
   There's even a tobacco-funky upstairs cigar room. Spy is also
almost alone in that it betrays nary a whiff of
country-and-western, still the mainstay of many Houston night
spots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other popular downtown dance clubs include Club Some, Oz, and
the 804 Underground Lounge and Disco, all with multiple levels of
dancing and head-throbbing music. Rich's Night Club offers a
similar multi-level experience with an emphasis on Houston's
sizable gay population, except for regular ``hedonism nights''
aimed at a hetero crowd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kemah _ from a Karankawa Indian word meaning ``wind in the
face'' _ sits on the southwest shore of Galveston Bay, a
thumb-shaped body of water fed by the Trinity and San Jacinto
Rivers that connects the Gulf of Mexico to the heavily
industrialized, man-made Houston Ship Channel.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center, home of NASA, is not far
away, and the area is a combination of aerospace, middle-class
suburban sprawl and weekend getaways for Houston's boating crowd. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The uninspiring, 20-mile drive from downtown Houston is
something to be endured rather than enjoyed, but the eventual
approach into the small village of Kemah provides some refreshing
gusts of gulf air and a sense of welcome remove from Houston
congestion and strip-mall hegemony. The boardwalk development
itself, approached under one of two archways, is a pleasingly
atmospheric jumble of ship masts, carnival rides and ersatz seafood
shacks.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-acre complex opened in February 1998, was badly battered
by a tropical storm the following summer and quickly put back in
order, with no storm scars in evidence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Landry's Seafood Restaurants developed the project, home to the
largest Landry's in the chain, a casual seafood place with a bent
toward Cajun spicing, as well as to outposts of the company's other
restaurants, including Joe's Crab Shack, the Crab House and
Cadillac Bar, a Tequila-shooting Tex Mex sort of place. There is
also a 52-room Boardwalk Inn overlooking a splash fountain for
children, a train ride that winds entertainingly in, through and
around the development, a carousel, a 65-foot Ferris wheel and
several other kiddie rides.
</P>
<P>
   But the undisputed centerpiece of the development since its
opening early this year has been the Aquarium Restaurant, a
three-story affair on the boardwalk's western edge that draws in
almost as many tourist-gawkers as it does diners. Described by
developers as an ``underwater dining adventure,'' the Aquarium is
built along theme-park lines, offering a sensory as well as a
culinary experience that begins with an entrance that resembles an
underwater cavern out of ``The Little Mermaid'' and a staircase
that wraps around a dazzling tube of water at least six-feet
across, glowing bright blue and filled with fish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The third floor is reserved for special buffets and private
functions, but the second floor is the complex's show-stopper, a
bar and restaurant with stunning views of the water and a
wrap-around assortment of aquarium tanks, including a 55,000-gallon
one that feeds views of dozens of sea creatures into the cavelike
dining area and the outdoor patio. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The place is run a bit like a military operation; waits can be
long and, while there was no sign of hurry in the pace, tables are
turned over with amazing rapidity. But for a place with such an
emphasis on decor and sensory experience, the kitchen is terrific,
with a flair for all manner of gulf seafood, especially shrimp, and
a tendency to smother fresh flounder and haddock in mountains of
delicious crab meat, scallops and other fruits of the sea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, most night-life expansion in Houston continues to be
downtown _ which is something of a godsend to residents playing
host to out-of-town visitors. The pleasures of life in Houston _
and they are many _ tend to revolve more around its neighborhoods
and rich restaurant and night-life scene.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has no Liberty Bell, no Statue of Liberty, not even an
Alamo, so it used to be a bit of a chore to figure out what to do
with visitors. The monolithic and crenelated glass towers have
always been a strong lure, but until recently they offered only an
empty promise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No longer. Now, a morning in the lush gardens at Bayou Bend or a
visit to the Space Center can be followed by a lunch of barbecue or
Tex Mex, an afternoon at the Menil and an evening downtown _ drinks
at a sidewalk cafe overlooking Jones Plaza, a play or a concert,
and a wonderful dinner at any one of a dozen nearby restaurants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking New Orleans here. It's not even San Antonio,
with its beautiful River Walk, or even the funkier night life
stretches on Sixth Street and the Warehouse District in Austin. But
it's a start: people on the streets, music filtering from smoky
rooms, neon and bustle, the crackle of cosmopolitan life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With downtown resurgent, Houston has begun to feel _ both for
residents and for visitors _ more like a city in the round. &QL;

AT THE FIELD MUSEUM, A WORM'S-EYE VIEW 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Field Museum in Chicago has just completed a
15,000-square-foot permanent exhibition that will, through the
illusory magic of a curator's wand, shrink visitors to
one-hundredth of their normal size and set them loose in a
subterranean wonderland. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guests begin their visit to Underground Adventure at the
Scientist's Base Camp, where they are briefed on the remarkable
``technology'' that is going to shrink them to half an inch,
enabling them to see eye to eye some of the Earth's least well
known and most prolific organisms. Visitors then file into the
Shrink Chamber, which optically downsizes them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000-square-foot total immersion portion of the exhibition
teems with soil-packed jungles of gargantuan dangling roots,
burrowing worms and ravenous wolf spiders. Visitors can crawl
through vacant worm holes and discarded exoskeletons and observe a
moving four-foot centipede or 11-foot crayfish. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After visitors have toured the Micro Soil Lab and its 3,000
organism replicas and 6 animatronic, or moving, displays, they will
pass through the Reverse Shrink Chamber and be restored to
``original'' size.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other areas in the exhibition include the Mud Room, where
visitors can examine real soil and organisms. There are also
interactive computer stations where agrarian enthusiasts can try
their hands at solving modern soil challenges and manage a
1,000-acre virtual farm.
</P>
<P>
   The Field Museum, which is open daily, is on the Museum Campus
on Lake Shore Drive and Roosevelt Road. Admission is $7; $4 for
children ages 3 to 17. Admission is free on Wednesdays. Underground
Adventure costs an additional $4; $2 for children. Information:
(312) 922-9410. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CELEBRATING 75 YEARS OF VERMONT'S PARKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vermont will mark the 75th anniversary of its state park system
this summer with programs on crafts, wildlife and history. Aside
from campsites, swimming areas and hiking trails, many of Vermont's
50-plus state parks contain remains of logging camps, iron
smelters, early settlements, mills, railroad beds, mines and
quarries.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Little River State Park in Waterbury, for example, is
crisscrossed with old roads and stone walls dating from the early
1800s. The foundations of houses and barns, the remains of farming
equipment, a sawmill and sugarhouse are all visible in the hills
above the campground. Along the river are reminders of the massive
Civilian Conservation Corps project that built the 835-acre
Waterbury Reservoir in the 1930s. A printed guide is available for
a ``history hike'' through the area. During the summer season, the
park offers evening pontoon-boat cruises on the reservoir.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 14 and 15 have been designated History Weekend at the state
parks, with such events as ``Walk Back in Time'' at Quechee State
Park, Indian programs at Grand Isle and North Hero parks and a
history cruise of Lake Champlain from the Burton Island State Park
The folk singer Margaret Mac-Arthur will perform at Emerald Lake
State Park in Dorset on Aug. 14 at 7:30 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other events include fishing clinics on June 12 (at Bomoseen
State Park in Fair Haven, Brighton State Park in Island Pond and
Lake Carmi State Park in Enosburg Falls); a Wood Carvers Week July
25 to 30 at Grand Isle State Park; a Crafts Weekend June 26 and 27,
and an Understanding Nature Weekend, July 31 and Aug. 1.
Information: (800) 837-6668 (select 2 on the voice-mail options),
or www.vtstateparks-.com. &QL;

   &QL; 
IN ALASKA, ECO-TOURS START WITH A COPTER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of heli-skiing. Why not heli-hiking? Outdoor
enthusiasts will be able to drop into southeast Alaska this summer
on Alpine Excursions Heli-hiking Tours, offered by Cape Fox Tours
of Ketchikan, Alaska. Cape Fox's tours focus on history, native
heritage and wilderness ecosystems. The heli-hiking expeditions,
which will run through Sept. 30, will allow visitors to experience
and learn about the diverse Alaskan ecosystem that thrives above
the timberline, at 3,200 feet. Participants are flown 20 minutes by
helicopter from George Inlet, 13 miles from Ketchikan, then led on
a 90-minute hike through the alpine environment where wolves, black
bears and three species of ptarmigans reside. Back at George Inlet,
visitors tour an old cannery and take a short walk through the rain
forest there. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tours are geared to cruise passengers, groups and the general
public; about $230 a person. Information: (907) 225-4846, extension
317 or 310. In summer, you can book in person at the Ketchikan
Visitors Bureau, (907) 247-6605. &QL; 
 &QL; 
REPASTS OF THE PAST AT HISTORIC HOUSES IN BRITAIN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several National Trust sites in Britain will offer visitors a
chance to sample a taste of history this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Paston-Williams, an expert on historic recipes, has trained
National Trust chefs to recreate a range of dishes appropriate to
the age and location of each property. Wherever possible,
ingredients are grown on site or are locally produced. Chefs are
encouraged to research family records and diaries to find recipes
used by the residents of each house or characteristic of the area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Properties in Devon, Cornwall and Wessex (Bristol-Bath, Dorset,
Somerset and Wiltshire), Uppark in West Sussex, Ham House in
Richmond, Knole in Kent, and Hidcote Manor Garden and Snowshill
Manor in Gloucestershire are among the places that will be serving
historic food. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For example, at Petworth House in Sussex, the food will be from
the medieval period and will include baked salmon with wine sauce
($9.90) or potted butter beans and fresh herbs ($5.80); at Cliveden
in Buckinghamshire, Victorian-Edwardian dishes will include George
Bernard Shaw's nut roast ($8.65) or spinach and Stilton flan with a
nutmeg crust ($8.65), and for dessert gooseberry and elderflower
fool ($4.40); at Ham House in Richmond, Stuart and Restoration
dishes include local pork, lemon and ginger sausages in an
applesauce casserole ($9.90), or spiced onion tart ($9.60). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meals will be served at the properties' on-site restaurants. In
most cases it is not possible to make reservations, so visitors are
advised to call in advance and arrive early. Most properties are
open through October, and some reopen during Christmas to serve
traditional seasonal fare.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Trust Handbook and the Historic Dishes at National
Trust Properties pamphlet are available from the National Trust
Membership Department, Post Office Box 39, Bromley, Kent BR1 3BR;
telephone (44-181) 315 1111. The handbook is also available from
bookshops in England; $7.50. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CORRECTIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An entry in the International Datebook listing on May 2 for Maya
folklore festivals in Guatemala misstated the dates. They are July
22 to July 25, not June 28 to July 4.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Practical Traveler column on May 2, about code sharing _ the
sale of tickets by one airline on another line's flight, but under
its own flight number _ cited one example erroneously. Delta is not
seeking government approval to put its code on Finnair flights to
Moscow and St. Petersburg, Russia.

EGYPT: THE CONVOY ROUTE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By NANCY R. NEWHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While I wasn't obsessed with security on my first visit to Egypt
in late February and early March, I certainly had it in mind. And I
wondered to what degree tourism had recovered from its
near-collapse after the tragic massacre of 58 tourists by Islamic
militants at the temple of Hatshepsut near Luxor in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is that a huge security operation is in place
at tourist sites in Egypt, and tourism is definitely back, if not
to 1997 levels. According to the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism,
visits dropped from a record high of almost 4 million in 1997 to
under 3.5 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stop in Cairo, my husband and I flew to Luxor
ahead of our Nile cruise departure and took a day trip to the
temples of Abydos and Dendera, about three hours north of Luxor by
car. Our guide set an early departure time of 7:30 the next
morning, and we soon understood why. For trips out into the
countryside, tourists must now go in convoy, with a truckload of
soldiers armed with submachine guns front and back. The convoys
left Luxor daily at 8 a.m., 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   When we arrived at the departure point, there was a cheerful
hubbub as vans, enormous buses, taxis and cars congregated and
soft-drink vendors worked the crowd; not too long after the
appointed hour, we steamed off in single file. Passing through
villages was something of an event, given the long convoy, with
friendly Egyptian children waving and jumping up and down as we
passed. At every major crossroads, armed soldiers were highly
visible.
</P>
<P>
   After about half an hour on the road, the convoy split into
three, with the largest group by far going to Hurghada for a day's
outing on the Red Sea. Again, each of the three smaller convoys had
soldiers front and back. The escort stayed with our group of four
or five vehicles for the whole trip.
</P>
<P>
   Outside every temple and tomb in the Nile Valley that we visited
on our own and as part of the cruise, soldiers were posted at the
entrances and dotted around in strategic spots. In Abydos, behind
the temple, I gazed at two robed figures sitting on camels on a
bluff, romantically profiled against the sky. It took a few minutes
to see that they too were carrying submachine guns.
</P>
<P>
   Temple and tomb sites on the principal tourist artery of the
Nile between Luxor and Aswan were clean and orderly, unless you
count desert dust. But in Abydos, which is somewhat outside that
circuit, we were sorry to see the bleak square in front of the
temple, with an appallingly filthy restroom and a forlorn cafe
(closed at the time).
</P>
<P>
   It seemed particularly dreary in contrast to the richly green
farmland of the Nile Valley that we'd driven through, where farmers
cut sugar cane and impossibly small white donkeys ridden by large
men trotted alongside irrigation canals _ the harvest page from an
Egyptian Book of Hours.
</P>
<P>
   Given the setting at Abydos, I prepared myself for
disappointment, particularly because from the outside, the mortuary
temple of Seti I (1294-1279 B.C.), constructed by him and his son
Ramses II, looks somewhat unimpressive. But the interior of this
temple, with its glorious painted wall reliefs, is a marvel that
rivaled anything we saw in Egypt. In fact, when I later mentioned
Abydos to Yassin Yassin, our superbly well-informed guide on the
Abercrombie &AMP; Kent Sunboat IV, he remarked: ``Oh, but you saw the
best first! You should have seen it last.''
</P>
<P>
   Passing through the later and less fine First Hypostyle Hall
into the Second, you enter a shadowy forest of heavy columns, with
exquisitely decorated limestone walls. (We regretted not having a
small flashlight. for the darker areas.) In places the paint has
faded, so that many scenes, incised in elegant high relief, are
alabaster pale, which only accentuates their perfection.
</P>
<P>
   The color in others is still remarkably intact. A row of seven
small chapels opening off this hall is also beautifully adorned
with scenes of Seti and various deities. There were just a handful
of tourists at Abydos (unlike the crowds at Karnak and the temple
of Hatshepsut), signs of deterioration on some walls, and one lone
guardian for the whole temple _ the price, perhaps, of being off
the main Nile Valley tourist circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperous turn-of-the-century travelers went in style, a fact
confirmed by two famous grand hotels along the Nile, the Old Winter
Palace in Luxor (built in 1886 by Thomas Cook) and the Old Cataract
in Aswan (built in 1899), both recently spiffed up to their earlier
luster. We spent two nights in the Old Winter Palace, and rejoiced
in the high-ceilinged rooms, the wide hallways, and the general air
of slightly faded grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nile-view rooms are the most sought after, we took the
somewhat less expensive garden view on the theory that we would see
plenty of the Nile on the cruise. Then we congratulated ourselves,
because our balcony overlooked the oasislike palm garden, a riot of
greenery and birds. (The original old section of the hotel is kept
separate from the unattractive large new wing, although both share
the garden and enormous pool.)
</P>
<P>
   For a splurge, we reserved a day ahead for dinner in the 1886
Restaurant, a small luxury restaurant that is separate from the
main dining room; the food and service were good, and we had a nice
bottle of Chablis for $35 _ memorable because imported wine was
prohibitively expensive elsewhere in Egypt, including on the cruise
ship, and Egyptian wine is only for the determined.
</P>
<P>
   Although we didn't stay at the Old Cataract Hotel in Aswan,
where our cruise ended, we skipped a shipboard event to take the
ferry across the river to see it. Grandly situated above the Nile
in a spacious garden, the hotel lives up to its Agatha
Christie-enhanced reputation and then some, the fabulous Moroccan-
and Middle East-eclectic decor an exotic melange of dark red walls,
filigreed wooden screens, wondrous light fixtures and arabesque
arches.
</P>
<P>
   The dining room alone, a cavernous domed space with an
atmosphere of Arabian Nights gloom, was worth the visit.
Gratifyingly, some of the guests looked either like older English
country gentlemen or cast members from ``The English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   When we returned to traffic-crazed Cairo, among many small
random pleasures we encountered was the marvelous puffy bread,
baladi, baked to order in beehive ovens by two costumed women just
outside Kebabgy, a pleasant kebab restaurant situated right on the
Nile in the El Gezirah Sheraton.
</P>
<P>
   Another hotel with marvelous views of the river, in this case
elevated well above it, is the Meridien-Le Caire. It is on the
north end of the island of Roda. Nonguests can have tea or drinks
on the breezy terrace if they meet a hefty minimum; the hotel's
24-hour restaurant and coffee shop, La Brasserie (there is also a
more upscale restaurant), with a jaunty yellow and blue decor,
offers the same view, glassed in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An easy walk from the Meridien brings you to the Manial Palace,
built in 1903 by King Farouk's cousin. Although in his excellent
guide, ``Egypt,'' for Cadogan, Michael Haag describes Manial as
``bizarre kitsch,'' lovers of period decor will enjoy the sumptuous
turn-of-the-century tile work and the palace's atmosphere of kooky
luxe (bypassing two other buildings, the hideous, mostly
faux-French ``throne room'' and the depressing little hunting
museum).
</P>
<P>
   And in the lovely palm-shaded garden is a small, dusty museum
displaying, along with various oddities, a fine collection of
Islamic calligraphy and Oriental rugs.
</P>
<P>
   We were intrigued to see women, some in Muslim-style head
scarves, smoking water pipes both at Kebabgy and at the Abou Aly
cafe in the Nile Hilton, a popular spot with Cairenes. We assumed
water-pipe-smoking was strictly a male affair. It seems that some
free-spirited Egyptian women have taken it up in the last few
years. One of our male guides grumbled wryly that this recent trend
boded ill for Egyptian men.
</P>
<P>
   There is a distinct pattern to an exploration of Cairo's
medieval quarter (confusingly called Islamic Cairo), from bustle to
tranquillity and back again. Making your way through the narrow,
dusty streets teeming with hawkers and hurried pedestrians and men
balancing trays of bread on their heads, past small shops and down
crooked passageways, you arrive at one of the many ancient mosques,
some of which are not easy to find.
</P>
<P>
   Yet stepping inside, you are suddenly in a place of utmost quiet
and repose, generally with just a few other visitors or a guardian
who will request a small baksheesh. Since Cairo's mosques are built
on an open plan _ the four interior sides open onto a courtyard _
they feel airy and accessible.
</P>
<P>
   A few trees or even an interior garden sometimes add to the
sense of calm. I was amazed at the cool air that seemed to waft
naturally through the arcades in these mosques, a sign of the early
architects' skills.
</P>
<P>
   In the vast interior of Ibn Tulun, built in the 9th century and
restored in the 13th, birds flit through the deeply shadowed
arcades, and it is hard to imagine the mosque's enormous courtyard
filled with the thousands of worshippers it was built to
accommodate. Because we were saving our energy for a many-mosque
day, we didn't climb the minaret, but later wished we had for the
view. Unlike any other minaret in Cairo, it has a spiral walkway
winding around the exterior, giving it a surprising, Oz-like
quirkiness in the otherwise austere structure.
</P>
<P>
   On a completely different, intimate scale, yet again a place of
complete peace, is the lovely mausoleum of Qaytbey. It is in a
decrepit section of the Islamic quarter not far from the City of
the Dead, an area our driver disapproved of and that we might have
spent a good while finding without our guide. (We hired a guide and
car one day to tour the old quarter; a second day we walked on our
own, once we had the lay of the land.)
</P>
<P>
   This 15th-century Mameluke mausoleum is as warm and colorful as
an Oriental carpet, with its original jewellike stained glass
windows set in typical deep stucco frames, its elaborate floor
paving and dome of dizzying carved complexity. There were only two
other visitors in the echoing interior, a far cry from what must
have been its brilliant heyday. &QL;

HOW THE WILD WEST LOOKS TO A REFUGEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's the first time you've been on a commercial
airplane, or maybe any airplane, and you've been inside it for so
long that day and night have overlapped, leaving you trapped in a
haze of dawn _ or dusk _ where the sun never quite rises or sets.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't what you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't want to leave your home in Kosovo, which is all
you've ever known, all you ever wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't want to leave the refugee camp, where at least the
landscape and some of the faces were familiar.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't want to get on this airplane and fly across the ocean
and then across the North American continent to this place called
Arizona, which you couldn't find on a map if your life depended on
it.
</P>
<P>
   And now your life depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of these people,'' says Maureen Webster, director
of the Phoenix area Catholic Social Service, ``I think of courage.
We act sometimes as if it would be so easy to come to the United
States, that everybody wants to come here. But imagine what that
would be like if you were one of these refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Land of palms and pools &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plane descends and you look down at the land, which isn't
green and hilly like the place you were born, but brown and flat,
like a plank sticking out from the edge of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The words on the signs in the airplane mean nothing. The crew's
English is noise in your ears, like crickets on a summer night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first meet the refugees we're assisting at the airport,''
Webster says. ``We'll have someone there who speaks their language,
to translate for the social worker. We'll pick up whatever baggage
they have _ often very little _ then we'll drive them to the
apartment we've rented for them. Usually, it's a place not too far
from our offices (at 19th and Northern avenues), so we can keep in
close contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the airport is in a hurry. Outside it is too warm
for May, and even on the ground you can see to the ends of the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The road you drive on is unbelievably wide and filled with too
many cars. In spots it lifts up over other roads with even more
cars. To the west of the airport are the towers of downtown, set
like chess pieces on an enormous playing board.
</P>
<P>
   The radio music you don't like, and the radio voices you can't
understand. Everywhere are squares of houses bordered by palm trees
_ (begin ital) palm (end ital) trees _ and tiny pools in the yards,
which you saw from the airplane and asked about and couldn't
believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But it's true.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
New home, new life &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a large Albanian population here,'' Webster says,
``so I don't know how many refugees from this conflict we'll get.
But we'll get some. We've had many wonderful people offering to
help. And the refugees will need it. They all do, whether they come
from Eastern Europe or Asia or Africa. We get them every year,
about 1,700, from all those places, and it's tough on them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment you arrive at is small and clean, but where is it?
You couldn't find it again if you wandered off. You couldn't ask
directions. The social worker says if there's trouble you can dial
911. But what trouble? It was trouble that put you here.
</P>
<P>
   You are told you must get a Social Security number, whatever
that is, which you'll need to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   You may be a doctor or a lawyer or a college professor. It
doesn't matter in this strange place, where every few feet there
seems to be a restaurant from which the smell of cooking hamburger
drifts onto the road like fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have no idea what a transition like this is like,
or how scary it is for these people,'' Webster says.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe you do.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your first trip to Arizona was like a trip to the moon.
Maybe you couldn't relate to the landscape and thought the people
here dressed funny and acted funny and talked funny. Maybe you
believed at first there was no way you could live and work here.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, like me, you'd only flown in from Pennsylvania. &QL;

STEPHEN HUNTER RETURNS WITH A TERRIFIC THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBIE HESS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fans of Stephen Hunter's series featuring sniper Bob Lee Swagger
will not be disappointed by ``Time to Hunt'' (Island Books, $7.95,
paperback, 592 pages).
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1971 as Vietnam War protesters overrun
Washington, Cpl. Donny Feen, 22, is stationed at the Marine
Barracks in the capital. With only 13 months left to serve, Donny
is a short-timer and unlikely to be sent back to the Land of Bad
Things, as the Marines call Nam. But things go south when two
officers in the Naval Investigative Service ask him to spy on Pfc.
Edgar Crowe, who is believed to be leaking information to the peace
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Donny reluctantly agrees to do so and meets one of the big
leaders of the movement, Trig Carter. At one of Trig's parties,
Donny runs into his fiancee Julie, a nursing student in from
Arizona for the big peace march. When the naval investigators
arrest Crowe, Donny refuses to testify and is shipped off to
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Donny becomes Swagger's spotter and the two take on a battalion
of Viet Cong to save a Marine outpost from being overrun. Donny
gets a leave, goes to Hawaii and marries Julie.
</P>
<P>
   When he gets back, Swagger has gotten Donny assigned to a desk
job for the remainder of his tour. But Donny refuses the job, and
returns to spot for Swagger. Word gets out that a Russian sniper is
in the area and Swagger sets out to trap him.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Swagger is still haunted by his memories of
Vietnam. He now lives on a ranch in the Sawtooth Mountains of
Idaho, with his wife and their 8-year- old daughter, Nikki. On a
morning ride, a sniper kills a neighbor and wounds Swagger's wife.
Now Swagger must dig deep into the past to discover why someone is
trying to kill him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to Kill'' starts out slowly and I began to think the
first half should have been edited down drastically. But as Hunter
develops his engrossing tale, I realized how well he laid the
groundwork for Swagger's hunt for the sniper. ``Time to Kill''
really exposes some of the demons of Swagger's past.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't read Hunter, start with ``Black Light,'' ``Dirty
White Boys'' and ``Point of Impact.'' If you are already a Hunter
fan, rush out and get a copy of ``Time to Hunt.'' It's terrific.
</P>
<P>
   (``The Sands of Sakkara.'' By Glenn Meade. St. Martin's Press.
</P>
<P>
   $29.95. 400 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   One of my fondest travel memories is of a brisk November morning
outside Cairo. As I was pulling into the parking lot at the Step
Pyramid of Sakkara, a tour bus was pulling out. For one hour, I was
the only tourist exploring this wondrous structure.
</P>
<P>
   When Glenn Meade's World War II spy thriller came across my desk
it went to the top of the pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sands of Sakkara'' begins when the body of an elderly
white man washes up on the banks of the Nile in Cairo. New York
Times reporter Frank Carney believes it is the remains of Johann
Halder, whose German father's priceless Egyptian artifact
collection disappeared during the war. The elder Halder was killed
during the bombing of Hamburg in 1943 and the son was believed
killed during a secret mission the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Carney goes to the dead man's apartment. There he runs into Col.
Harry Weaver, who for more than 40 years was an adviser on American
presidential security. And Weaver gives Carney a great story, with
a stipulation: He can't print it until after Weaver's death.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Halder was the son of an American mother and a wealthy
German industrialist. Harry Weaver's father worked on the Halders'
New York estate and the two boys became the best of friends. In the
summer of 1939, the two join an archaeological dig at Sakkara.
There they meet Rachel Stern, the daughter of the dig's German
leader. Both fall in love with the beautiful Jewish woman.
</P>
<P>
   When war is declared, Halder heads for Germany to enlist.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Weaver returns to the States and enlists. Rachel and
her family were believed killed when their ship bound for Istanbul
exploded.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, Weaver is assigned to the Cairo Embassy as an
intelligence officer. When embassy security is breached prior to
the secret summit meeting of Winston Churchill and Franklin D.
Roosevelt at Mena House near the pyramids, Weaver and British
intelligence officer Alfred Samson are assigned to hunt down German
operatives in Egypt. In Berlin, Halder is ordered to lead a mission
to Egypt to kill FDR. One of his operatives will be Rachel Stern,
who has been interned at Ravensbruck concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Meade weaves well-developed characters into a complex plot that
moves with a brisk pace. His vivid descriptions of the sights and
sounds of Egypt made me feel like I was back at Sakkara.
</P>
<P>
   (``The Alternate.'' By John Martel. Dutton. $24.95. 417 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   John Martel puts an unusual spin on the legal thriller _ and it
works.
</P>
<P>
   Lara Ashford, a former beauty queen married to former Rep.
Elliot Ashford, had been unfaithful. When she is brutally murdered
in their Pacific Heights mansion in San Francisco, Elliot is the
only suspect the District Attorney's Office is willing to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Ashford hires a big-name attorney from Los Angeles to defend
him. But he needs someone local and well-respected to help at the
bail hearing, so Barrett Dickson is brought in. Once the best
litigator in San Francisco, Dickson is now on the skids. But the
search for justice helps him dry out as he sees a rush to judgment
against his client _ for everyone involved has a hidden agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The client has a real alibi he can't reveal because he was
meeting with a Illinois gangster on parole. If the judge finds out
the gangster left the state, he'll go back to prison for a long
time.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Earl Field wants to use the case as his
springboard to the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Grace Harris begins to have doubts
about how Field is handling the case when a crucial piece of DNA
evidence disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Alternate juror Amanda Keller, a former soap opera star now
working as head file clerk, will do anything to get Ashford
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Martel's legal thriller is a smart look at the politics and
legal maneuvering of a front-page murder case. His characters are
well-developed as the story moves along at a sturdy pace. I would
hope that a juror could never get away with Amanda Keller's
actions, but it sure makes for a fascinating twist.

CONFESSIONS OF A JEDI JUNKIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JASON LLOREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As far back as I can remember, I've always
wanted to be a Jedi.
</P>
<P>
   To me, being a Jedi was better than being Superman. Sure,
Superman could fly, bend steel, see through walls, and carry a
tanker on his back. His body bulged out of his blue jumpsuit and
his red cape waved around him like an American flag.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jedi were cooler. They wore samurai robes and tapped
into the Force to mind-trick opponents and move objects. They flew
fancy ships in space like they were doing laps at the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   And they carried the coolest weapon ever dreamed up: the light
saber, a glowing, humming blade of energy that could cut through
flesh and steel like butter.
</P>
<P>
   Face it, a Jedi could kick the Kryptonite out of Kal-El. Any kid
who saw ``Star Wars'' when it first burst onto the big screen in
1977 knew that.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 16 years after ``Return of the Jedi'' played in movie
houses, my friends and I are busily arranging our vacation time
around the May 19 opening of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because we still remember the tragedy that befell Jedi
master Obi-Wan Kenobi, the menace inspired by Darth Vader's
presence and the excitement of the dogfight-like Death Star battle.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the new movie is half of that experience, it'll be worth
the effort.
</P>
<P>
   I first saw ``Star Wars'' when I was 7, the perfect age for this
sci-fi space saga to make an impression. My dad drove me all the
way from our suburban Pittsburg home to San Francisco's Alexandria
Theater to see it.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't even see it opening day; we waited as it gained more
attention _ and drew longer lines of moviegoers. Back then it was
not the phenomenon it is today. At first, it was just some sci-fi
flick, just a curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see what the big deal was about this space film,''
my dad said recently, almost dismissively.
</P>
<P>
   The film opened up a whole new world to me. ``Star Wars'' was
more than a movie _ it was a journey I shared with my friends and
family, that spurred my imagination.
</P>
<P>
   It gave me a love of science fiction, of films and ultimately of
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The movie introduced us to Luke Skywalker, still just a kid, who
hung out with these cool droids, a giant rug called a Wookie, a
space cowboy named Han and a gorgeous chick named Leia (a princess,
at that). They hopped around in sleek spaceships and used blasters
to fight off the bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, even Darth Vader, frightening as he was, became part of
the fun. He was a cool villain.
</P>
<P>
   The Cantina scene introduced us to these weird creatures and
aliens. The Death Star represented this menacing globe. The final
X-Wing battle scene turned out to be a wild ride, and we were there
in the backseat like R2D2.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Kenobi and the mysterious Force he talked about
at length. I grew fascinated with this omnipresent ``energy field''
he spoke of, one that surrounds us, penetrates us and binds the
galaxy together. It was something more than magic but short of
being God. It was heady stuff for a kid to comprehend but that
didn't matter. What the Jedi had, I wanted: to learn the Force and
to wield my own light saber.
</P>
<P>
   My friends and I settled for the toys and our own imagination to
recreate the magic of the film. My dad used to buy me stacks of
``Star Wars'' collector cards, so many that the shoe box that I
stored them in bulged on the sides. Buying those packets of bubble
gum and cards became a ritual for us; we'd drop by the gas station,
he'd pick me up four or five packs at a time, like they were
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   For my circle of friends, ``Star Wars'' was a way of life aside
from family and school. We'd grab sticks and have make-believe
saber duels in our back yards. My friend Ben and I would gobble up
the action figures, space vehicles, whatever; as soon as they hit
the toy shelves we'd somehow convince our parents they were
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, we seemed to be competing. I bought a Leia and Luke,
Ben got the TIE Fighter. I got the rolling Landspeeder, he snagged
an X-Wing. I blew him away by getting the multilevel Death Star
playset with working elevator, exploding cannon, extending bridge
and garbage compactor with crushing wall.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it was a marketer's dream that fed the toy companies'
profits. But it also fed our imagination.
</P>
<P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My love of ``Star Wars'' went beyond the toys and the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Using my action figures, vehicles and my dad's black-and-white
video camera, I recreated scenes from the film. I'd stage light
saber fights between Vader and Kenobi using crude animation. It was
pretty pathetic, but I was consumed by the Force. There was no
Blockbuster Video then and ``Star Wars'' wasn't on VHS until the
mid-'80s, so I'd try anything to relive the movie in whichever way
I could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars'' became a part of our culture, a part of our
consciousness. And it keeps coming back. When ``The Empire Strikes
Back'' was released in 1980, it fed our hunger. It was another
journey into fantasy, another roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   The images left an indelible impression: Elephant-like AT-Ats
walked the snowy plains of planet Hoth. Luke first met Jedi master
Yoda on a gray swampy planet. A giant asteroid worm nearly
swallowed the Millennium Falcon. Han and Leia visited a city that
floated among the clouds. Luke and Vader engaged in a saber duel
filled with fury and suspense.
</P>
<P>
   Swamps, snow planets, asteroid fields? Again, George Lucas
painted a strange yet wondrous world _ and the movie was even
better than the first ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I can't even remember where and when I first saw
``Empire'' _ aside from the movie itself, all I recall are even
longer lines at the box office and more booty in my toy chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return of the Jedi'' brought the Force back three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I had outgrown the toys (temporarily), I was hyped
on the film. I remember the day after it opened, a bunch of kids in
school kept bragging about how good the film was. One kid had
boldly predicted, ``It's gonna beat `E.T.''' at the box office (it
didn't; ``E.T.'' made $704 million internationally versus
``Jedi's'' $471 million).
</P>
<P>
   From 1977 to 1983, ``Star Wars'' captured the imaginations of an
entire generation. There was always talk about Lucas making
``prequels'' (movies set before the events in ``Episode IV''), but
it always seemed like Hollywood rumor fodder. ``Star Wars'' slowly
receded into our collective subconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I still longed for the return of the Jedi, by the
mid-'80s I had given up. There would be no more, I told myself.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a rebirth. In 1997, Lucasfilm released the ``Star Wars
Trilogy: Special Edition.'' The classic was back, freshened with
new scenes and enhanced special effects. My friends and I waited
hours in line at the cinema for all three of the reissued films;
joining us were a whole new legion of fans just discovering the
trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   The new effects weren't what made the films so special. The
reason ``Star Wars'' never escaped my imagination was because it
generated such enthusiasm on a basic narrative level: It was modern
mythology for my generation. It was a galaxy-spanning tale of
bravery, faith and redemption. It was an incredible story when I
saw it in 1977; it remains one today.
</P>
<P>
   The gods of Greek, Norse or Roman mythology have remained with
us for a long time. For me, so has Luke Skywalker.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I find myself 7 again. I've been buying the toys. My
roommate and I _ both of us thirtyish _ were dueling with toy light
sabers in the living room the other day (we broke one) the way two
guys would toss a football.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years after ``Jedi,'' Lucas now brings us ``The Phantom
Menace.'' I honestly never thought I'd live to see the prequels.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the Force has been with us all along.

HOW THE WILD WEST LOOKS TO A REFUGEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's the first time you've been on a commercial
airplane, or maybe any airplane, and you've been inside it for so
long that day and night have overlapped, leaving you trapped in a
haze of dawn _ or dusk _ where the sun never quite rises or sets.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't what you wanted.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't want to leave your home in Kosovo, which is all
you've ever known, all you ever wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't want to leave the refugee camp, where at least the
landscape and some of the faces were familiar.
</P>
<P>
   You didn't want to get on this airplane and fly across the ocean
and then across the North American continent to this place called
Arizona, which you couldn't find on a map if your life depended on
it.
</P>
<P>
   And now your life depends on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of these people,'' says Maureen Webster, director
of the Phoenix area Catholic Social Service, ``I think of courage.
We act sometimes as if it would be so easy to come to the United
States, that everybody wants to come here. But imagine what that
would be like if you were one of these refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Land of palms and pools &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The plane descends and you look down at the land, which isn't
green and hilly like the place you were born, but brown and flat,
like a plank sticking out from the edge of the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The words on the signs in the airplane mean nothing. The crew's
English is noise in your ears, like crickets on a summer night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We first meet the refugees we're assisting at the airport,''
Webster says. ``We'll have someone there who speaks their language,
to translate for the social worker. We'll pick up whatever baggage
they have _ often very little _ then we'll drive them to the
apartment we've rented for them. Usually, it's a place not too far
from our offices (at 19th and Northern avenues), so we can keep in
close contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the airport is in a hurry. Outside it is too warm
for May, and even on the ground you can see to the ends of the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The road you drive on is unbelievably wide and filled with too
many cars. In spots it lifts up over other roads with even more
cars. To the west of the airport are the towers of downtown, set
like chess pieces on an enormous playing board.
</P>
<P>
   The radio music you don't like, and the radio voices you can't
understand. Everywhere are squares of houses bordered by palm trees
_ (begin ital) palm (end ital) trees _ and tiny pools in the yards,
which you saw from the airplane and asked about and couldn't
believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But it's true.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
New home, new life &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a large Albanian population here,'' Webster says,
``so I don't know how many refugees from this conflict we'll get.
But we'll get some. We've had many wonderful people offering to
help. And the refugees will need it. They all do, whether they come
from Eastern Europe or Asia or Africa. We get them every year,
about 1,700, from all those places, and it's tough on them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The apartment you arrive at is small and clean, but where is it?
You couldn't find it again if you wandered off. You couldn't ask
directions. The social worker says if there's trouble you can dial
911. But what trouble? It was trouble that put you here.
</P>
<P>
   You are told you must get a Social Security number, whatever
that is, which you'll need to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   You may be a doctor or a lawyer or a college professor. It
doesn't matter in this strange place, where every few feet there
seems to be a restaurant from which the smell of cooking hamburger
drifts onto the road like fog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have no idea what a transition like this is like,
or how scary it is for these people,'' Webster says.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe you do.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe your first trip to Arizona was like a trip to the moon.
Maybe you couldn't relate to the landscape and thought the people
here dressed funny and acted funny and talked funny. Maybe you
believed at first there was no way you could live and work here.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, like me, you'd only flown in from Pennsylvania. &QL;

   ISRAELI POLITICIANS WOO THE RUSSIAN VOTE
</P>
<P>
   TEL AVIV -- With a bit more than a week left before Israelis go
to the polls to elect a new prime minister, the two leading
candidates have turned the campaign into a race for the crucial
Russian immigrant vote.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has unveiled a package of
benefits for World War II veterans from the former Soviet Union,
and has strongly hinted that if he were reelected, the powerful
Interior Ministry portfolio would be given to a party representing
Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, the Labor party leader, Ehud Barak, suggested
making a national Israeli holiday of May 9 -- the date Russia
celebrates its victory in the war. And, he said, he would provide
special social benefits for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very aggressive campaign on the street for the
Russian vote,'' said Boris Yentin, an editor at the
Russian-language daily newspaper Vesti.
</P>
<P>
   Polls have found that Netanyahu is losing support among voters
from the former Soviet Union, who make up almost 15 percent of the
electorate and in 1996 were key to bringing the Likud leader to
power.
</P>
<P>
   Backing for Barak has risen to almost 40 percent among what is
called ``the Russian vote,'' a big jump from the 25 percent of a
few months ago, according to a poll yesterday in Vesti. Netanyahu's
support dropped to 55 percent from 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some disappointment in Netanyahu's policies and
Barak is making a good showing, representing himself as a man who
struggle for Israel and promising many things if he takes office,''
Yentin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Netanyahu may have scored some points yesterday when he
persuaded the strictly observant Orthodox Shas party, one of the
key members of his outgoing coalition, to apologize for derogatory
comments made about the Russian immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In its campaign advertisements, Shas has called Russians
``counterfeiters, con men and call girls.'' This has led to a
crisis because another main Netanyahu coalition partner is a
Russian immigrant party, Yisrael B'Aliyah. Barak and Netanyahu have
been trying to attract support of Yisrael B'Aliyah, which is headed
by the former Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sharansky was a minister under Netanyahu, he has
refused to give public support to Netanyahu's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Backing from Sharansky, whose party is a favorite among Russian
voters, would be a boost to either candidate, and both are playing
to him.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by Israeli newspapers how he felt about the
attention, the short, balding Sharansky said: ``They've finally
come to realize that I'm a handsome, tall man with thick curly hair
-- let me enjoy myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But the issues that Sharansky is promoting for his Russian
constituents go to the heart of many of Israel's internal
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   About 800,000 people from the former Soviet Union have emigrated
to Israel in the past decade, helping to increase Israel's
population to 6 million, and providing a wealth of talent in
science, medicine and high-technology fields.
</P>
<P>
   This immigration has also brought problems. Israel's economy has
been unable to absorb everyone, leaving some immigrants stuck doing
poorly paid jobs far below their skills. Overall, Israel's
unemployment rate is almost 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At least a third of the new immigrants are not considered
Jewish, according to religious law, under which the mother must be
Jewish. The issue is delicate, because marriage, burial and divorce
are controlled by the religious authorities, and those whose
Judaism is in question may face obstacles for all three. Because
the Interior Ministry registers citizenship, Russian immigrants
have many complaints about the Shas party, which under Netanyahu
has controlled the ministry. This has put Netanyahu in a difficult
position, because he is trying to woo both the strictly Orthodox
Jews and the Russians at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   In another arena dealing with the Russians, Netanyahu may have
received an unexpected present from Barak, although the origin of
the gift is clouded. Barak printed up Russian translations of his
published biography, which details his life as one of the country's
top military officers. And this week, it was found that the
Russian-language version had been doctored to make it sound as if
Barak was willing to divide Jerusalem and hand over part of it to
the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   This does not go over well with Russian voters, who generally
take a more hard-line position on negotiations with the
Palestinians and the return of occupied land.
</P>
<P>
   The writers of the biography said the original had made it clear
that Barak had never said anything about giving up part of
Jerusalem, while his Russian translator said her version was also
true to the Hebrew original.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has not waited for the mystery to be solved. His
political campaign ads have highlighted the disputed statements as
proof that Barak is ``soft'' on the Arabs.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KATZRIN, Golan Heights -- As far as Yoav Tsur is concerned,
living on the Golan Heights is the closest thing to heaven on earth
-- or maybe it is heaven itself.
</P>
<P>
   He owns a house in a quiet town where people leave their doors
unlocked, he drives to work on empty roads lined with flowers, and
he runs his own company on a hilltop with breathtaking views all
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here because I loved this area and I still do. Somehow,
I must be crazy to be willing to give this all up,'' said Tsur.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 years after Israel captured the Golan Heights from
Syria, the 44-year-old engineer stands on the front line of a new
battle for the strategic plateau.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, the fight is among Israelis: between those
who would keep the Golan forever and those who believe it should be
returned to Syria as part of a comprehensive peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   With national elections set for May 17, the two camps are
digging in on the heights, where some 17,000 Jews have set up home
since the 1967 war. Posters and bumper stickers are the weapons of
choice, as politicians and residents here push their platforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure my kids understand why I am willing to leave our
home,'' said Tsur, whose three children were born on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if giving up the Golan means peace with Syria, then how
can I stand against that, even if it means abandoning my house and
my life?'' asked Tsur, a founding member of ``Way to Peace,'' a
group of Golan residents who support trading land for peace with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   But another group, the Golan Residents Committee, argues that
the land must never be returned to Syria. Until Israel occupied the
plateau, Syria used it to attack Israeli towns in the Galilee
below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria has a terrible reputation. They may want the Golan but
they are not interested in peace,'' said spokeswoman Marla Van
Meter.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians think the latter position wins votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Third Way, a centrist party that is part of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud-led coalition government, has taken to
the campaign trail with a slogan that promises the Golan Heights
will always remain in Israel's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, meanwhile, has chastised the previous Labor
government for what he said was its willingness to hand over all of
the Golan Heights to Syria. At a recent Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu
accused Labor of planning to ``retreat to the banks'' of the Sea of
Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new study for the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies in Tel Aviv, more than 70 percent of Israelis polled either
do not want to return the Golan or would support only a partial
return.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the West Bank, which has religious significance for Jews,
ties to the Golan Heights are based on its strategic importance.
Rising nearly 1,300 feet above the Jordan Valley and comprising
about 485 square miles, the heights not only provide a direct line
of fire into Israel or Syria, but they also sit on top of important
water reserves. It is easy for Israel to maintain control on the
Golan, which was annexed in 1981, because most of the 100,000 Arabs
who lived there fled during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leader Ehud Barak, Netanyahu's main rival for prime
minister, has not specified what he would give up for peace with
Syria, but he has promised to bring any agreement to a referendum.
Negotiations with Syria have stalled since Netanyahu took office
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A Barak adviser said Israelis tend to be hesitant on giving up
land until faced with the real possibility of a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for the Israeli public to be willing to give back the
whole Golan Heights they need to see and touch and look at a
package and that's not there now,'' said Alon Pinkas, Barak's
foreign policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that might change people's minds is a growing sense
that Israeli soldiers should not have to die in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has 35,000 troops stationed in Lebanon and there are some
who say the road to peace in Lebanon runs through Damascus.
</P>
<P>
   And for engineer Yoav Tsur, the way to peace with Syria runs
through the Golan and he wants to make sure politicians hear this.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the Golan and want to keep the Golan, but I
believe in the end the majority of Israelis will go for peace even
if the price is giving back the Golan,'' he said.

ANGER AT KURD MILITANT EXTENDS TO HIS TURKISH LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL -- Ahmet Zeki Okcuoglu no longer frequents his favorite
restaurants and rarely walks down the street alone. Public
transportation is out, as is any activity that requires him to mix
with strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am simply afraid,'' said the bespectacled 51-year-old
Okcuoglu, one of the lead lawyers for Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan, whose trial begins later this month on charges of treason
and separatism.
</P>
<P>
   Ankara says nearly 10,000 soldiers and civilians have died in
his Kurdish rebel war for self-rule in southeast Turkey, making
public hatred of Ocalan so high that his lawyers are coming under
attack for defending a man dubbed ``baby killer'' by the press.
Some have received death threats.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, lawyers said they were beaten by police who were
escorting them away from the courthouse in an armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be lawyers, not heroes,'' Okcuoglu said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The capture in February of Ocalan is celebrated by Turks, who
say Ocalan and his Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) are terrorists out
to destabilize Turkey. Since Ocalan's arrest, Kurdish suicide
bombers have staged attacks, only increasing anger at Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan is specifically charged with ordering killings of
children, teachers and other civilians in his fight for Kurdish
self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be little question that Ocalan, who is the sole
inmate on an island prison, will be found guilty. There is no
disputing that he founded the PKK and that since 1984 the rebel
group has been waging a war in southeast Turkey that continues to
this day.
</P>
<P>
   Okcuoglu said he and his team of 20 lawyers will use the trial
to argue that Turkey represses its Kurdish minority and that
repression underlies the rebel war. ``I hope this court case will
be an opportunity for Kurds to explain the problems they face and
what rights they want to have,'' said Okcuoglu.
</P>
<P>
   Okcuoglu said he will argue that Kurds have long been denied
basic ethnic rights by the Turkish state and that those who have
chosen nonviolent methods of protest have been punished as much as
those who have taken up arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the start the state only gave Kurds the chance to fight
for their rights by resorting to guns and violence,'' said
Okcuoglu, himself jailed three times in the past 10 years for
speeches and articles in which he criticized Turkey's policies
toward Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both sides should be judged, Turks and Kurds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurdish complaints focus on laws that restrict expression of
Kurdish identity. The Kurdish language is not allowed to be taught
in schools nor used in TV broadcasts. Books on Kurdish culture are
often banned as ``propaganda'' while people have been jailed for
interviewing Ocalan or calling for changes in Turkey's policies
toward the Kurds.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey argues such restrictions are necessary to protect against
separatist movements. In the past Turkish politicians have said
that it was impossible to consider changing the laws while the
country was fighting what it calls terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Ocalan is seen by some Kurdish and Turkish
intellectuals as a chance for Ankara to reevaluate its treatment of
the Kurdish minority, which makes up an estimated 20 percent of
Turkey's 65 million people. ``This is definitely an important
opportunity for Turkey, now they can say they have the violence
under control and it's a chance for the state to make some changes
in its policies,'' said Akin Birdal, chairman of the independent
Human Rights Association.
</P>
<P>
   Birdal and others argue that restrictions on Kurdish identity
and abuses committed by soldiers fighting the rebels have helped
fuel the rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 Kurdish villages in the southeast have been emptied
in the course of the war, and human rights activists said many
villagers were forced out by Turkish soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A country that closes down democratic routes for dealing with
problems ends up strengthening violence,'' said Serafettin Elci, a
61-year-old Kurdish politician and well-known opponent of Ocalan
and the guerrilla war. His party was closed down by the high court
earlier this year because the platform advocated Kurdish ethnic
rights, which the court said constituted ``separatism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Turkey's position has hardened since the capture of Ocalan,
who for years had been based in Syria until Ankara pressured
Damascus to kick him out last year.
</P>
<P>
   Caretaker Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit has said there is no
Kurdish problem in Turkey, only an economic problem stemming from
lack of investment and job opportunities in the poverty-stricken
southeast.
</P>
<P>
   The second largest party in parliament, after Ecevit's party, is
the far-right Nationalist Action Party, which also denies existence
of a Kurdish problem. The expected coalition government is not
expected to make any concessions.

FORMER TEXAS PROSECUTOR TO DO PRISON TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ A federal judge sentenced a former state
prosecutor to five years in prison for selling leniency to drug
defendants in what the government described as ``pervasive
corruption'' in the Webb County district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is concerned about this type of conduct, and I
think the city of Laredo would want to purge itself of people that
bring it shame,'' U.S. District Judge John Rainey said Monday in
sentencing Ramon Villafranca, the former Webb County assistant
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Villafranca, 59, stood silently as he was ordered to prison for
63 months and fined $10,000. Villafranca, who was an elementary
school principal in Laredo before becoming a lawyer, was allowed to
remain free on bond pending an order to report to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Rainey said Villafranca's actions eroded public trust in the
Webb County district attorney's office, but the judge rejected a
bid by prosecutors for a sentence of up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned about the loss of public confidence in this
matter,'' Rainey told the defendant. ``I hope this does send a
message we cannot tolerate this in a civilized society.''
</P>
<P>
   Rainey predicted other public officials were watching Monday's
sentencing and would be influenced by its outcome. Villafranca's
two-week trial in January included witnesses Jesse Salas, a bounty
hunter who secretly worked for the FBI, and Ruben Garcia, a former
state district judge who testified the he had split bribes with
Villafranca.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Salinas, the lawyer representing the former prosecutor,
said the federal government brought shame to Laredo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have prosecuted him without making the circus that
this case has become,'' Salinas told the judge. Salinas criticized
the investigation and the May 1998 federal raid on the offices of
Joe Rubio, the Webb County district attorney, and other officials.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,000 criminal case files were seized, as well as
financial and other documents, during the federal investigation of
Villafranca.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Don DeGabrielle said the sentence
satisfied him. ``It sends a message that corruption will not be
tolerated,'' DeGabrielle said outside court.

SUMMER'S HOT SPOTS: 10 U.S. EVENTS THAT REALLY SIZZLE

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The living may be easy in the summertime, but selecting a place
to spend your vacation can be downright tough. There simply are too
many appealing destinations, attractions and events from which to
choose.
</P>
<P>
   Here are 10 U.S. events or attractions that may be the best of
the last summer of the 1900s:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ISLANDS OF ADVENTURE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dinosaurs and Dr. Seuss take center stage at Universal Studios'
Islands of Adventure, which will have its grand opening later this
month in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The 100-acre park is part of a $2.8 billion expansion that
Universal execs hope will level the playing field with Disney as a
destination resort. The new expansion includes CityWalk, an
entertainment and retail district, and Portofino Bay, a luxury
hotel. The additions and the existing movie-themed park are being
touted as Universal Studios Escape.
</P>
<P>
   With two major roller coasters, high-tech motion simulators,
splashy water rides and a painstakingly reproduced Jurassic Park,
Islands of Adventure provides central Florida its first real thrill
park. Universal adds family appeal with Seuss Landing, where the
Cat in the Hat comes alive and guests ride sofas into the whimsical
storybooks of Theodore Geisel.
</P>
<P>
   One-day tickets for Islands of Adventure are $42 ($34 for
children). Travel packages that include park admission, lodging and
car rental are available. Call 407-363-8000.

   &QL; 
PORTLAND ROSE FESTIVAL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stop and smell the roses _ hundreds of thousands of them _ at
the Portland Rose Festival in Oregon. The 25-day extravaganza kicks
off June 3 with the coronation of the Rose Queen and runs through
June 27.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its 91st year, the Rose Festival expects to draw more
than 500,000 guests with its more than 80 events. Highlights of the
schedule are the Grand Floral Parade (one of three festival
parades), a juried art show, a symphony concert with guest artist
Ray Charles, boat and car races, flower shows and a ferret fair.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of this year's Rose Festival is ``Set Sail for Fun.''
One of the spotlight events is Fleet Week, when dozens of ships
from all over the world dock on the Westside Seawall of the
Willamette River to welcome visitors. Festivalgoers can tour
vessels of the U.S. Navy, the Coast Guard and the Royal Canadian
Navy.

   &QL; 
TELLURIDE BLUEGRASS FESTIVAL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For four days each year, the town of Telluride, Colo., and its
symbiotic neighbor, Mountain Village, swells from a community of
1,500 to more than 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Telluride Bluegrass Festival is an EVENT as thousands pack
Town Park to hear music artists ranging from folk to traditional
bluegrass and blues. This year's festival, which will be June
17-20, will feature Willie Nelson, Leo Kottke, Bela Fleck &AMP; the
Flecktones, Earl Scruggs and Friends, Shawn Colvin, Steve Earle and
Mary Chapin Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Held in conjunction with the festival, the Telluride Bluegrass
Academy presents music workshops, songwriter competitions,
performances and family activities such as clown acts and a petting
zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The ``festivarians,'' most of whom camp just outside of town,
are as entertaining as the performers. The permit-required camps
become satellite cities filled with campfire jams and communal
kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Telluride limits vehicular traffic in town for the festival's
run. Only residents and guests staying in the in-town lodging are
permitted to park. The rest of the crowds are shuttled in by bus,
or they bike or hike into town.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you are not a bluegrass fan, festival time can be fun.
The people-watching is outstanding, and while the campgrounds may
be packed, you'll never need a reservation at the town's many fine
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   If you tire of crowds, just take a free gondola ride up to the
Mountain Village and blissfully empty hiking trails.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the Telluride Bluegrass Festival are sold out this
year, but it is never too early to start planning for next year's
festival. No date has been set for the 2000 event, but you can get
on a mailing list to receive ticket and lodging information. Call
Planet Bluegrass at 800-624-2422 or access www.bluegrass.com.

SMITHSONIAN FOLKLIFE FESTIVAL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 1 million visitors are expected to take part in the
Smithsonian Folklife Festival, which will stretch along the Mall in
Washington, D.C., June 23-27 and June 30-July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Co-sponsored by the National Park Service, the festival
celebrates America's cultural traditions in concerts,
demonstrations, workshops and panel discussions. This year's event
will spotlight New Hampshire, Romania and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Paying tribute to New Hampshire, craftsmen and artists will
demonstrate canning and preserving, boot making and boat building.
The event also will feature Yankee fiddling and the raising of a
post-and-beam barn.
</P>
<P>
   Music and dance groups from Moldova, Transylvania and Wallachia
will perform as part of the Romanian program, while a Swazi house
will be constructed on the Mall in a demonstration of South African
crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Festival hours are 11 a.m.-5:30 p.m. each day. In addition,
dance concerts will be 5:30-7 p.m. daily. Special evening events
are offered 7-9 p.m. except July 4. All events are free.

NEW ORLEANS &QL; 
WINE &AMP; FOOD EXPERIENCE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One lament commonly heard last week in New Orleans during a Jazz
&AMP; Heritage Show weekend: ``The locals don't go anymore. Too many
tourists. Too big. Too crowded.''
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad for the 30-year-old festival, which draws tens of
thousands of music lovers from around the world. One of the joys of
the Crescent City is its colorful characters and the gracious
hospitality of its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another festival where you can get a taste of the
city's rich cultural heritage and fine cuisine, and chances are
you'll be rubbing elbows primarily with New Orleans natives.
</P>
<P>
   It is the New Orleans Wine and Food Experience. Only 8 years
old, the June 23-27 event is quickly becoming one of the premiere
food and wine events in the country.
</P>
<P>
   That is no surprise when you have the great restaurants of New
Orleans from which to draw your culinary talent. Among the nearly
100 restaurants participating in the festival are Alex Patout's
Louisiana Restaurant, Arnaud's, Brennan's, Broussard's, G&AMP;E
Courtyard Grill, Galatoire's, Gumbo Shop, K-Paul's Louisiana
Kitchen, Kelsey's, Ralph &AMP; Kacoo's, Semolina and the Upperline.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 wines from 100 wineries worldwide will be
showcased during tastings, vintner dinners and seminars.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere event of the festival is the Royal Street
Experience on June 24. Dozens of galleries on Royal Street in the
historical French Quarter open their doors for an evening of wine,
food, antiques and live jazz. Armed with a souvenir glass, guests
are encouraged to visit each shop for a wine and food sample.
</P>
<P>
   Other Wine &AMP; Food Experience events include two grand tastings,
a Sunday champagne brunch and special prix fixe vintner dinners at
26 top restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   A complete package that includes the Royal Street Experience,
both grand tastings, Sunday brunch and five seminars is $375. The
vintner dinners are priced separately at $75 per person. Other
event tickets also are offered a la carte.

   &QL; 
HEMINGWAY DAYS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's quite a love story. Ernest Hemingway loved Florida's Key
West, and today the city still celebrates its fondness for the
Nobel Prize-winning author.
</P>
<P>
   The Hemingway Days Festival, which runs July 16-25, will mark
the 100th anniversary of the birth of Hemingway, who wrote his
classics ``For Whom the Bell Tolls'' and ``A Farewell to Arms''
while residing on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The Papa Hemingway Look-Alike Contest, a festival favorite, will
be held at one of the writer's old watering holes, Sloppy Joe's.
The look-alike event is expected to draw more than 100
white-bearded contestants who will be judged by past winners and
Hemingway family members.
</P>
<P>
   A festival highlight is the Hemingway Days Writers Workshop and
Conference, where seminars by authors, scholars and those who knew
the writer will be presented. Book signings and readings also are
planned. Other Hemingway Days events include a street fair, sailing
regatta and arm-wrestling competition.

   Cuisines of the Sun, hosted by the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel and

 &HT;    BREAUX CRITICIZES FELLOW DEMOCRATS ON MEDICARE REFORM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _The chairman of the failed Medicare reform
commission Tuesday lashed out at his fellow Democrats, charging
that many of them want a campaign issue more than real reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly those who don't want to do anything on this,
and use this as a political issue,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
who chaired the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission fell one vote short in March of the
super-majority required by law for it to make a recommendation to
Congress on reforms. Breaux and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., were the
only Democrats who voted for Breaux's proposal. It would have had
managed care plans compete for customers, with the federal
government subsidizing up to 88 percent of the cost of the average
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that setback, Breaux and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the
panel's vice-chairman, plan to introduce legislation later this
month along the lines advocated by a majority of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast Tuesday at the National Press Club, Breaux was
particularly harsh in his assessment of the motives of fellow
Democrats. He said more Democrats don't want reform than do want it
because they can then attack GOP efforts to tinker with the popular
program that covers 39 million elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux rejected the suggestion that this year would not be ripe
for Medicare reform because it is too close to the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be an election,'' he said, noting that House
members have to run for office every other year. ``If the politics
of it becomes the guiding principle, then we will never do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said he was hopeful President Clinton would keep his
promise to offer an administration proposal to reform Medicare,.
But the senator said the White House will need to go further than
it has in order to offer substantial reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has suggested using 15 percent of the projected federal
budget surplus -- about $700 billion over the next 15 years -- to
extend the financial viability of the Medicare Part A trust fund.
Without reform, that fund -- which pays hospital bills -- is
expected to run out of money in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said he was concerned that Clinton was receiving
conflicting advice: some urging an incremental approach that
tinkers with the current system; other pushing for more fundamental
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it (the White House reform proposal) is
comprehensive,'' Breaux said. ``If it is status quo, just with more
field testing or pilot projects, that's not real reform. I don't
mind putting more money into the program. I think it needs more
money, but it needs to be a different program.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said his bill would differ slightly from the plan
considered by the commission in that it would offer prescription
drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries as an additional
option. The price of that option has not been determined.

 &HT;    BREAUX CRITICIZES FELLOW DEMOCRATS ON MEDICARE REFORM
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _The chairman of the failed Medicare reform
commission Tuesday lashed out at his fellow Democrats, charging
that many of them want a campaign issue more than real reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly those who don't want to do anything on this,
and use this as a political issue,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
who chaired the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission fell one vote short in March of the
super-majority required by law for it to make a recommendation to
Congress on reforms. Breaux and Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., were the
only Democrats who voted for Breaux's proposal. It would have had
managed care plans compete for customers, with the federal
government subsidizing up to 88 percent of the cost of the average
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that setback, Breaux and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., the
panel's vice-chairman, plan to introduce legislation later this
month along the lines advocated by a majority of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast Tuesday at the National Press Club, Breaux was
particularly harsh in his assessment of the motives of fellow
Democrats. He said more Democrats don't want reform than do want it
because they can then attack GOP efforts to tinker with the popular
program that covers 39 million elderly and disabled Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux rejected the suggestion that this year would not be ripe
for Medicare reform because it is too close to the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be an election,'' he said, noting that House
members have to run for office every other year. ``If the politics
of it becomes the guiding principle, then we will never do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said he was hopeful President Clinton would keep his
promise to offer an administration proposal to reform Medicare,.
But the senator said the White House will need to go further than
it has in order to offer substantial reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has suggested using 15 percent of the projected federal
budget surplus -- about $700 billion over the next 15 years -- to
extend the financial viability of the Medicare Part A trust fund.
Without reform, that fund -- which pays hospital bills -- is
expected to run out of money in 2015.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said he was concerned that Clinton was receiving
conflicting advice: some urging an incremental approach that
tinkers with the current system; other pushing for more fundamental
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it (the White House reform proposal) is
comprehensive,'' Breaux said. ``If it is status quo, just with more
field testing or pilot projects, that's not real reform. I don't
mind putting more money into the program. I think it needs more
money, but it needs to be a different program.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said his bill would differ slightly from the plan
considered by the commission in that it would offer prescription
drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries as an additional
option. The price of that option has not been determined.

PROPOSED BILLS IN TEXAS LEGISLATURE WOULD RESTRICT RIGHTS OF TEENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN BROOKS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It seems that a teen-ager's life is one big
government-created paradox.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-year-old is old enough to get a job, yet too young to vote
for the people who set the minimum wage. Old enough to drive a
vehicle, but too young to be out alone at night. Old enough to be
punished like an adult, but too young to be treated like one.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Texas Legislature this session doesn't add a few more
caveats to a teen-ager's rights _ such that they are _ it's not for
lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 bills filed this session would limit teen-agers in
some way, from raising the driving age and limiting body piercing,
to lengthening the list of offenses that require automatic
detention and criminalizing sex between teens.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the proposals appear to be going nowhere in the
waning weeks of the session, it does say a lot about the opinion of
the lawmakers when it comes to the younger generation in this day
and age, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happen to be at a time in our history where I think
teen-agers are the object of a lot of antipathy, and are feared
much more than they have been in the past,'' said Laurence
Steinberg, professor of psychology at Temple University. ``And the
people now who are trying to restrict all these freedoms that kids
have were baby boomers in the 1960s, out there marching for those
very same freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the major pieces of legislation that are showing
potential for becoming laws this session include requiring minors
to tell their parents before they have an abortion; to have
parents' consent for body piercing; and to have adult supervision
during the first year of driving, with graduated driver licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Others that are pending in committees offer an example of the
mind-set of lawmakers in terms of governing teen-agers:
</P>
<P>
   One bill would mandate automatic criminal detention for fighting
on a school bus. Another, filed in reaction to a spate of heroin
overdoses among young people in suburban communities of North
Texas, would make it a crime for a minor to ask someone for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Another would raise the age that a teen can check themselves out
of a treatment center from 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message from adults on these laws is two-fold,''
said Steinberg, who wrote the acclaimed parenting book, You and
Your Adolescent. ``On the one hand, we're trying to protect you
from something dangerous. On the other hand, we're trying to
protect ourselves from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers take a more moderate stance on that, saying the laws
are in place to empower parents in raising their children right _
along with protecting the youths.
</P>
<P>
   There are more restrictions on teens now than ever before, they
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Already, teen-agers can lose their driver's license if they are
caught with a pack of cigarettes. They can be thrown out of school
for making a menacing remark.
</P>
<P>
   Congregate at some malls without an adult, and they get busted
by juvenile authorities. In some communities, it is illegal for a
child to be out on the street during school hours.
</P>
<P>
   As teen-agers watch the laws and restrictions piling up with
each legislative session, they point out that most of them obey the
law and their parents. And, they say, enough already.
</P>
<P>
   ``More teen-agers might start to rebel'' if more restrictions
are imposed, Jared Silpa, 16, of Bedford. ``I'm not rebellious, but
I might rebel if I lost certain freedoms.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because times are changing, and the laws have to keep up,
said Rep. Toby Goodman, R-Arlington, who sponsored the massive
rewrite of the juvenile justice code last session. He also
acknowledged that ``99 percent of the kids out there are good
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I was growing up, you weren't reading in the
newspaper about 15-year-olds wearing gang colors going around in a
car shooting up houses, killing people ... (and) committing
suicide,'' Goodman said. ``When I was growing up, society was a
whole lot different than society is today. And if my children tell
me one thing, it's, `Dad, you know, you grew up in a different
time. It's a different world.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a different world, but one that deserves fewer
restrictions, not more, said 28-year-old New York resident Dave
Doctor, director of Libertarian Rock, a Web-based activist group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People under 18 are more mature than they used to be,'' said
Doctor, who has organized protests against a curfew in San
Francisco. ``And politically, they're becoming more aware of the
impact on politics in their lives. It used to be the laws never
really affected them much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, now, the 14-year-olds' mothers are on Valium, their
little brothers are on Ritalin, and they can't even have a smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   There is yet another class of anti-curfew, anti-graduated
driver's license advocates who say the battle over restricting
teen-agers is not a question of kids' rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's a question of parents' rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that we do not give government the
responsibility of raising our children,'' said Sen. Jane Nelson,
R-Flower Mound, who wrote one of more than 10 parental notification
or consent bills this session. ``Government isn't the solution to
all of our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   A popular opinion is that teen-agers don't have any rights,
outside the rights to basic education and protection from abuse and
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   While schools or government can't restrict free speech or
freedom of religion, parents can, said Daniel Koller, a parental
rights attorney in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no such thing as freedom as a child. That's an absurd
thought to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson agreed to a lesser extent, saying that if a teen-ager has
a bill of rights, it is one that is written by his or her parents.
</P>
<P>
   But teen-agers say the government and their parents can only
offer guidance: Part of growing up is testing the limits,
experimenting, experiencing and making mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever law gets passed, they will find a way around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to stop teen-agers from doing something if they want
to,'' said Josh Gearn, 18, of Watauga. ``Your parents can only
watch you at certain times.''

TENDER SPINACH WITH CRISP SHALLOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My guess is that many people eat greens because they think they
should more than because they actually like them. This is a
circular problem: if you expect to dislike greens and put little or
no effort into their preparation, the results are inevitably dull.
</P>
<P>
   But there are a number of ways to make simple dishes of greens
more tantalizing. First and foremost is not overcooking them,
although I have friends from the South who disagree. The best
technique is not to steam greens but to simmer them in plenty of
water. They cook more evenly, it's easier to keep an eye on them,
and you will never burn the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Spinach takes about a minute, and collard leaves take a good 10
minutes (thick stems should be cooked a little longer). When
they're done, they can be drained and seasoned to serve
immediately, or refrigerated to reheat later. A quick toss in hot
olive oil scented with garlic, followed by a squeeze of lemon, is
enough to make any dish of greens appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The next level is still a minimalist preparation: make a topping
of crisp-fried shallots for the greens. By themselves, these
crunchy slices are irresistible; combined with tender greens, they
create an alluring contrast in flavor and texture. Even better, the
oil in which the shallots have been fried is a great addition to
the greens and, in the days following, many other dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The shallots must be thinly sliced. Use a mandoline if you have
one. Otherwise, lay the shallots on their flat sides, and then
slice as thin as you can using a sharp knife. Like the greens
themselves, the shallots can be cooked well in advance. When you're
ready to eat, just reheat the greens and sprinkle them with the
shallots.
</P>
<P>
   This preparation also serves as a good introduction to
deep-frying, because you can readily and infallibly detect when the
shallots are ready: they turn brown. At that moment, they must be
removed from the heat immediately, or else they will burn. The
flavored oil not added to the greens should be strained and stored
in the refrigerator; it can be used in vinaigrettes or for
sauteeing.
</P>
<P>
   TENDER SPINACH WITH CRISP SHALLOTS &QL; 
Time: 30 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup or more neutral oil, like grape-seed, canola or corn
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 large shallots (about 6 ounces), peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spinach, washed and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place oil to depth of at least an inch in a small to medium
saucepan or narrow, deep skillet. Turn heat to high, and wait a few
minutes, until the oil reaches 350 degrees. (If you do not have a
frying thermometer, put a couple slices of shallot in the oil; when
the oil bubbles vigorously around them, it's ready.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Add shallots, and cook, adjusting heat so that the bubbling
is vigorous but not explosive. Cook, stirring, until shallots begin
to darken, 8 to 12 minutes. As soon as they turn golden brown,
remove them with a slotted spoon; be careful, because overcooking
will burn them. Drain the shallots on paper towels, and sprinkle
with salt and pepper; they will keep for a couple hours this way.
Reserve oil. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt the
water, and add spinach. Cook it until spinach wilts, about 1
minute. Remove spinach with a strainer or slotted spoon, and plunge
it into a large bowl that has been filled with ice water to stop
the cooking. When spinach is cool, drain and chop it. (You can
store the spinach, covered and refrigerated, for as long as two
days, if you like.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Place 1 tablespoon of the shallot oil in a skillet, and turn
heat to medium-high. Add spinach, and cook, stirring frequently and
breaking up any clumps, until it is hot, about 5 minutes. Season
with salt and pepper, and add lemon juice. Serve topped with crisp
shallots. &QL; 
Yield: 4 servings.

SPIN DOCTORS FOR YOUR SALAD GREENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Next to having fresh greens, the most important thing when
making a salad is that the greens are crisp yet dry. If you wash
lettuce and let it dry at room temperature, it will turn limp. If
you wash lettuce and pat it dry in dish towels, you will never get
all the water out of the crevices in the leaves, and the extra
water will ruin the vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is the salad spinner, a hand-operated device that
works like the spin cycle in a washing machine. The wet lettuce is
whirled in a cylindrical basket and centrifugal force pulls the
water off of the lettuce leaves.
</P>
<P>
   In the dark ages of salad spinners, the base was simply a
plastic basket in a solid plastic bowl and a mechanism in the lid _
a crank or a pull string _ propelled the basket. Now, there are
more mechanisms and more features _ there are even salad spinners
that claim to do the full cycle, from wash to spin dry. But all
rely on the same simple principle: the faster the spin, the dryer
the lettuce.
</P>
<P>
   The classic crank design has a handle on top. The basket spins
at the speed at which you turn the crank. Many crank models are
poorly designed. They often do not connect with the basket well, so
when spinning, the mechanism skips or the basket gets off balance,
causing the lettuce to move to one side and slow the spinning. Of
three crank spinners, the best was made by Copco, $8.98 at Zabar's,
2245 Broadway, New York, N.Y., (212) 787-2000. It held a great deal
of lettuce, and both the base and turning mechanism were sturdy,
making it easy to turn the crank quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Copco also makes a crank that is operated as a lever on the top
that you move back and forth. I didn't have much hope for it, but
was impressed with its performance. The crank was smooth and held
on to the basket without getting off track. It's $18.95 at Broadway
Panhandler, 477 Broome St., New York, N.Y., (212) 966-3434.
</P>
<P>
   The Moulinex crank model has a spinner made to collapse like a
camping cup. It's a good idea _ salad spinners do take up a lot of
room _ but it is poorly executed. The basket holds very little and
once expanded, the spinner is as unstable as a top. It's $24.99 at
Gracious Home, 1220 Third Ave., New York, N.Y. (212) 517-6300.
</P>
<P>
   A new mechanism among salad spinners is the pump by Oxo. Rather
than a crank, it has a large button on the top of the spinner that
you press to turn the basket. The spinner is well constructed, and
the pump does work, but it fails to build up great momentum. Which
is too bad, because it has a great little feature _ a button break
for slowing down the basket, so you don't have to wait for it to
stop before opening. It's $24.95 at a Cook's Companion, 152
Atlantic Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y. (718) 852-6901.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite salad spinners turned out to be those operated with
a pull string. As with a yo-yo, you pull the cord, which is then
drawn back in. This lets you develop a rhythm, so that the basket
spins without any jarring. One drawback is that over time, the cord
often wears out and breaks or becomes hopelessly tangled.
</P>
<P>
   The Jet salad spinner definitely does the job, and it has an
opening on top for letting water from a faucet pour in as you spin.
You can wash the lettuce as you spin, then turn off the faucet and
continue spinning to dry it. Unfortunately, this feature doesn't
really work. Some lettuces can be very dirty and need to be swished
around in a sink full of water. The Jet is $19.99 at Gracious Home.
</P>
<P>
   The Zyliss was far superior to all of the spinners I tested. Its
cord pulled smoothly. The container was large and did not move out
of place, even during a fast spin. The lettuce leaves were bone dry
and crisp when they emerged _ ready for a touch of vinaigrette, a
toss and a fork to skewer them. The Zyliss spinner is $24.95 at
Zabar's.

IF IT AIN'T BROKE . . .  
 RETALIATION SHOULD BE LEFT IN THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At what point exactly did baseball decide to put restraints on
its players and no longer allow them to play the game the way it
has been played for decades?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's incident between the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis
Cardinals demonstrates how baseball's umpires, possibly at the
urging of the commissioner's office, are taking a step backward
rather than forward.
</P>
<P>
   This is a touchy subject to most casual baseball fans because
they believe any form of violence is wrong. So when Braves starter
 &UR; Greg
 &UR; Maddux drilled St. Louis'  &UR; Ray Lankford two pitches after Mark
McGwire hit a grand slam, the Cardinals rightly took exception.
</P>
<P>
   But when home plate umpire  &UR; Larry Poncino warned Cardinals
pitcher
 &UR; Kent Mercker before the start of the next inning not to throw at
any Braves players, he basically took away the one way St. Louis
could retaliate, which is to have its pitcher plunk a Braves player
and square things.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound barbaric, but it's the way the game has been played
since the start of the century _ you hit one of our guys on
purpose, we're going to do the same to one of yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not one of the problems baseball has,'' said Cincinnati
Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon, who has been involved in major league ball as
a player, coach, manager or general manager for 50 years. ``To me,
that's the way you play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing now is that hitters don't think a pitcher can
come inside at all. They get an inside pitch, and they're ready to
charge the mound. I'd love to see one of these guys charge someone
like  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Gibson,  &UR; Sal Maglie or  &UR; Don Drysdale. Those pitchers would kill
these hitters. But today, there's a different breed of player.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just the way the game is played. The one time players
should take exception to being hit is when a ball comes in toward
the head, where serious damage can occur. But pitchers such as
Drysdale would drill a hitter in the ribs _ a spot that would hurt
for weeks, causing that hitter to curse Drysdale for weeks.
Drysdale hit 154 batters during his career.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation should never be taken away in the game of baseball.
But now it has gotten to the point where the first club to strike
gets away with it because they simply plead innocence. In fact,
rarely are such instances innocent.
</P>
<P>
   They'll never admit it, but every single major league manager
has ordered one of his pitchers to hit an opposing batter at some
point in his career. It's truly an inside part of the game of
baseball. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who holds the club record for home runs by an Atlanta Braves
player? &QL; 
Rocket fuel &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toronto assistant general manager  &UR; Dave Stewart, one of the
fiercest competitors of the last quarter-century and one of the
most stand-up men in the game, is still quarreling with former Blue
Jays pitcher  &UR; Roger Clemens, who basically demanded to be traded
away from Toronto because he didn't deem the Blue Jays capable of
competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our club as a whole feels we're a better club without Roger,''
Stewart said. ``I don't believe Roger is conducive to winning. He's
more of a guy that's good at accomplishing individual goals, but I
don't believe he's capable of bringing a team to a championship.
The proof is in the pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not done it in Boston. He came to Toronto, and he didn't
do it there. The situation in New York _ it's not that he would
bring a championship there, but he'd be riding the coattails of a
club that can do it without him.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Clemens signed with Toronto two winters
ago after the Blue Jays made the highest offer for his services
and, at the time, he said he was there to help bring back glory to
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be noted that in 10 career meetings between
Clemens and Stewart (which includes the playoffs), Clemens never
once beat Stewart, who was 7-0 in those match-ups against Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Blue Jays do not appear to be the dregs of the
league, which is how some interpreted Clemens' painting of the
club. &QL; 
Credit where it's due &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just how good are the Cleveland Indians, owners of the best
record in baseball entering this weekend's series? Consider who
they have let go as a barometer of where they are at.
</P>
<P>
   Since the middle of the 1996 season, the Indians have seen
several top players leave either via trade or free agency, yet they
remain perched near the top of the 30 clubs in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of former Indians and where they are:  &UR; Albert
Belle, Baltimore's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Matt Williams, Arizona's

 &UR; Jeromy Burnitz, Milwaukee's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Jeff Kent, San
Francisco's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Brian Giles, Pittsburgh's No. 3
hitter;  &UR; Sean Casey, Cincinnati's No. 3 hitter; and  &UR; Marquis
Grissom, Milwaukee's No. 7 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to pitching, the list is also somewhat impressive.
It includes  &UR; Gregg Olson, Arizona's closer;  &UR; Jose Mesa, Seattle's
closer;
 &UR; Danny Graves, Cincinnati's closer; and  &UR; Chad Ogea, Philadelphia's
No. 3 starter.
</P>
<P>
   What did the Indians receive in exchange? Three players on their
current roster: third baseman  &UR; Travis Fryman and pitchers  &UR; Dave
Burba and  &UR; Steve Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever  &UR; Ricky Rincon (he no longer wishes to be called
Ricardo) was also acquired in a trade, but he remains on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   All of these moves are courtesy of General Manager  &UR; John Hart.
Say whatever you want about him or his ego, but Hart remains one of
the very best at his craft. &QL;

   Chicago Cubs management is promising a strict crackdown after
fans in the most famous bleachers in baseball inundated Wrigley
Field with half-filled beer cups, glass flasks of booze and full
cans of soda. The protests came about after a bad umpire's call
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing all of our options, including more security,
stationing personnel in different places, alcohol limits and other
opportunities available to us,'' said  &UR; Mark McGuire, the team's
executive vice president. ``I would suspect we will do some things
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cubs officials are caught in a tough spot because
they do not want to ruin the Wrigley Field bleachers for what they
are _ a great place to watch a ballgame. Yet, they realize they
must maintain some form of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's arguably the highest-demand seat in baseball,'' McGuire
said. ``We're caught trying to figure out the right way to do it.
Unfortunately, some of (the littering) is becoming part of the
tradition or culture of Wrigley Field, and it's one we would like
to lose quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs reliever  &UR; Rod Beck, known for indulging from time to time,
offered this opinion:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for having a good time myself and having a few pops,
but not for wasting beer by throwing it onto the field. I'd rather
drink it than throw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) they were throwing bottles and full pop cans and
baseballs. You're talking a guy's livelihood. What happens if
someone gets an eye put out?'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before you jump to the presumably obvious, think about how the
questions was phrased. It asked the Atlanta Braves player with the
most home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is  &UR; Dale Murphy, who had 371 career home runs in an
Atlanta uniform.  &UR; Hank Aaron hit 335 for Atlanta but is the
all-time Braves franchise leader with 733 home runs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Canning his emotions: Detroit's  &UR; Bobby Higginson was so frustrated
after a game last weekend that he took his bat and whacked the
toilet repeatededly. The next day, he hit two doubles and a single
in his first three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The newest member of the Jack Lord Fan Club: Pittsburgh catcher
 &UR; Jason Kendall became only the seventh player since 1970 (as far
back as they can check) to have a box score line of 5-0-5-0. He had
five hits in five at-bats and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Mackey Sasser.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And now, your Montreal EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEExpos!: Teammates, and
brothers,  &UR; Vladimir and  &UR; Wilton Guerrero have combined for 16
errors this season, nine by right fielder Vladimir.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Milestone week for managers: Three managers reached significant
victories in the past week. Los Angeles'  &UR; Davey Johnson got victory
No. 1,000, Cincinnati's  &UR; Jack McKeon notched No. 600 and Anaheim's
 &UR; Terry Collins got No. 400. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Giants second baseman  &UR; Jeff Kent became just the second player ever
to hit for the cycle (single, double, triple and home run in the
same game) at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium last week. The
other was  &UR; Joe Torre, who accomplished the feat in 1973 as a member
of the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rafael Palmeiro of the Texas Rangers is at opposite ends of the
spectrum when it comes to batting against left-handers and
right-handers, entering the weekend series. His .441 (30 for 68)
average against right-handers is the best in the American League.
Conversely, his .083 (2 for 24) average against left-handers is the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty early for such projections, but Atlanta's  &UR; Bret
Boone, who has five home runs and 18 RBIs, is on pace to become the
first Braves second baseman ever to have 30 home runs and 100 RBIs
in a season.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment in Pittsburgh is over, and catcher
 &UR; Jason Kendall has returned to the middle of the lineup. After
becoming one of the few catchers ever to lead off, Kendall was
dropped to fifth in the order. While in the top spot, though,
Kendall distinguished himself, batting .274 with seven stolen bases
in eight attempts. His .366 on-base percentage wasn't bad, either.
 &UR; Al Martin is the new leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The two pitchers tied for the most complete games in the
National League with two come from the Diamondbacks and Phillies.
As expected,  &UR; Randy Johnson is the name from Arizona. The one from
Philadelphia, however, might be surprising since it is  &UR; Carlton
Loewer, not  &UR; Curt Shilling, who mopped up in the category last
season with 15.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's  &UR; John Smoltz, who is 5-0 with a 1.69 ERA, won the
second Pitcher of the Month award of his career. Coincidentally,
the other time he won was also in April. The year was 1996, when he
won the league's Cy Young Award. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Minnesota closer  &UR; Rick Aguilera continues to be closely monitored
by Atlanta scouts. Word is that Aguilera will waive his no-trade
clause if a deal is stuck with Atlanta. Giving more credence to
this is the fact that a Twins scout spent all of last weekend
checking out Braves games.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland teammates appear to be growing a bit weary of  &UR; David
Justice's minor injuries. Justice has gone into Manager  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Hargrove's office moments before games and asked out of the lineup.
Justice, who is signed through 2002, has three home runs and eight
RBIs. He has played left field in 27 of the 188 games since the
start of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Former World Series hero and rumored Diamondbacks expansion pick
draftee  &UR; Craig Counsell is being shopped by the Florida Marlins. He
has been completely buried by the Marlins, who are committed to
starting  &UR; Luis Castillo at second base.
</P>
<P>
   In what is probably a precursor to a move in 2000, San Francisco
called up  &UR; Dave Righetti to assume the role of pitching coach when
 &UR; Ron Perranoski was forced to leave the club to attend to his
ailing mother. Several people within the organization are very high
on Righetti.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Gold Glove shortstop,  &UR; Omar Vizquel, is nursing a
pulled quadriceps that he hurt on April 10. The club refuses to
place him on the disabled list, even though his uncharacteristic
six errors (one more than all of last year) have been directly
related to the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Chicago Cubs Manager  &UR; Jim Riggleman to be a part of
 &UR; Bruce Bochy's All-Star Game coaching staff. Bochy, a member of
Riggleman's staff when he managed in San Diego, wound up replacing
Riggleman. The two remain close friends. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Cleveland &QL; 28-5 in games delayed by rain since
the start of 1996. &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. NY Yankees &QL; The record is not an indication of several problems
on this club. &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. Atlanta &QL; Does not appear to missing  &UR; Andres Galarraga's bat at
all. &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. NY Mets &QL; Have the best bullpen in the game, which tends to lead
to contending. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Houston &QL; Astros are talking about moving  &UR; Scott Elarton into the
rotation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
6. Los Angeles &QL; Dodgers are only 3-3 in games  &UR; Kevin Brown starts. &QL; 
 &QL; 
7. St. Louis &QL;  &UR; Fernando Tatis is looking mahvelous. Simply
mahvelous. &QL; 
 &QL; 
8. San Francisco &QL; Barely clinging to first place as the weekend
series started. &QL; 
 &QL; 
9. Texas &QL; May miss President  &UR; Tom Schieffer more than they want to
lead on. &QL; 
 &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. Florida &QL; Had two smallest home crowds ever last
week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
29. Montreal &QL; Does anyone really follow this club? Even in
Quebec? &QL; 
 &QL; 
28. Minnesota &QL; Wake us when all this stadium garbage finally gets
resolved. &QL; 
 &QL; 
27. Baltimore &QL; A little winning streak is a start, but problems
persist here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
26. Kansas City &QL; Royals are hoping pitcher  &UR; Jose Rosado only misses
one start. &QL; 
 &QL; 
25. San Diego &QL; Will the Padres go from first to worst to first to
worst? &QL; 
 &QL; 
24. Cincinnati &QL; Has won two in a row three times, but never three
in a row. &QL; 
 &QL; 
23. Boston &QL; That 6-1 start seems like it took place years ago. &QL; 
 &QL; 
22. Anaheim &QL;  &UR; Tim Belcher has not survived the fifth inning in five
of six starts. &QL; 
ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Oakland Athletics: Manager  &UR; Art Howe has these young A's playing
like they're ready to make a nuisance of themselves in the AL West,
a division where they were supposed to clearly be the underbelly.
But a little more than a month into the season, Oakland is looking
the part of a club with some interesting parts. Offensively, this
club can stack up with the best of them in the AL. The middle of
the lineup, which features  &UR; Jason Giambi,  &UR; Matt Stairs and
surprising  &UR; Olmedo Saenz, is more than respectable. Shortstop
 &UR; Miguel Tejada is showing the ability that led many in the
organization to compare him to a young
 &UR; Barry Larkin, and it may not be long until minor league pitching
sensation  &UR; Mark Mulder arrives in the Bay area. This is one of the
hottest clubs in baseball. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays: The Blue Jays lost at home last Tuesday, their
first loss at SkyDome in 10 games. They then lost again Wednesday
and Thursday, being swept by Oakland. All the good feelings that
were with this club in the middle of April seem to be disappearing.
Injured starter  &UR; Joey Hamilton is not expected to return before May
20, and the offense, which produced big scores during the past two
weeks, is getting little help from a pitching staff that is having
trouble keeping opponents under 10 runs. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Cincinnati, ahem, outfielder  &UR; Dmitri Young crashed into the
outfield wall at Turner Field last weekend while chasing a deep fly
hit by Atlanta's  &UR; John Smoltz. Young missed the next four games
because of soreness in his left side. Young said after that
particular game: ``I fought the wall and the wall won. Tomorrow,
I'm going to the &UR; Andruw Jones School of Wall-Climbing.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Texas Rangers reliever  &UR; Jeff Zimmerman can put to rest any tags
about being a castoff from the independent Northern League, the
same place that produced Atlanta's  &UR; Kerry Ligtenberg. Zimmerman
entered the weekend series at Toronto with a 0.93 ERA in 19
innings. In 10 games he has walked two and struck out 14. Texas
Manager  &UR; Johnny Oates is calling on Zimmerman in the toughest of
situations. Opponents are batting only .109 against the
hard-throwing right-hander, a figure that drops to .091 when
runners are on base. Not bad for a kid who was trying to latch on
to whatever Northern League club would take a look at him two years
ago. &QL;

TARTE TATIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Some people crave a small bite of something sweet to end a meal;
others like to savor a rich, salty morsel of cheese, especially if
they haven't finished all of their wine with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Since I'm always looking for new themes to base my desserts on,
I decided to create one incorporating the elements of a cheese
course: fresh and dried fruit and the cheese, itself. Its
centerpiece is a tarte Tatin _ a caramel-glazed, upside-down apple
tart anchored in a crisp puff-pastry crust. While baking, the
apples release their juice, and it mingles with the caramel to form
an intense, buttery sauce.
</P>
<P>
   It was more difficult to come up with a way to fit in the
cheese. I wanted something simple to complement the tart, rather
than compete with it. At the same time, it needed to be more
elegant than, say, the traditional plain wedge of cheddar served on
a slab of apple pie. I opted for a deliciously mild, creamy goat
cheese from Coach Farm, because it can be beaten to cloudlike
lightness with cream to add a fluffy contrast to the tart. On the
plate, it looks like an innocently mild dollop of whipped cream.
But there is no mistaking its tangy flavor, a cool piquancy against
the caramel-coated apples.
</P>
<P>
   For the third element, the dried fruit, I turned to golden
raisins, which I plump in a hot bath of apple juice and verjus. If
you've never used verjus, you're in for a pleasant surprise. It's
grape juice made from unripe grapes, which makes it much more
complex and less sweet than regular grape juice. Verjus brings out
the inherent grape flavor of the raisins without making them
cloying. (It's also a terrific poaching liquid for other kinds of
fruit, if you have any left over.)
</P>
<P>
   For all this dish's success as a hybrid of cheese and dessert
courses, I wouldn't necessarily recommend pairing it with leftover
wine from dinner. But it is beautifully enhanced by dessert wine
like Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise.
</P>
<P>
   One last note: Since apple season is coming to a close, feel
free to substitute peeled peaches in the tart and omit the raisins
in verjus. With vanilla ice cream substituting for the goat cheese
cream, it's perfect for those warm summer nights, which are only a
few weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   TARTE TATIN WITH GOAT CHEESE CREAM
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus 1 hour to cool
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar
</P>

skillet from heat, and whisk in butter until melted and smooth.
Arrange apple halves, cut sides up, over caramel.
</P>
<P>
   2. Roll puff pastry to an 11-inch circle, trimming if necessary.
Drape it directly over apples, tucking edges.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place skillet in oven, and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes,
or until pastry is puffed and golden brown. Allow tart to rest
until cooled, at least 1 hour.
</P>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 17 springs ago, I was given a spindly little rosemary
tree. Observed at a distance, it looked like bonsai; up close, it
resembled the sort of brown stick topped with green cloud that a
child might draw and call a tree. But unlike the naivete of a
child's artwork, my rosemary tree never became more refined or
precise. It grew taller and thicker and wild.
</P>
<P>
   And for reasons that may be more sentimental than culinary, I
get a bad case of rosemary chauvinism in the spring. My motivation
could not be culinary; I pinch little sprigs from the bush all year
round and, traditionally, rosemary is teamed with fall and wintery
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when I cart new basil and chervil, oregano, parsley and
thyme onto the terrace every spring, I fuss with them briefly and
then dote on my rosemary. Next to the fragile baby annuals, the
perennial rosemary is so valiant, thriving in the perpetual fumes
of trucks and cars and forgiving my erratic attentions.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, I did not maintain the plant as a botanical
sculpture. I trimmed it erratically when I wanted branches for
grilling or making kebabs, pinched back its needlelike leaves when
I needed a fresh herb. It grew from plant to shrub on the terrace.
</P>
<P>
   The little pot eventually became a bushel basket, a two-person
moving operation, a counter space glutton, and sometimes, a
disturbing mirror.
</P>
<P>
   When the bush is parched, so am I, in ways that the frenzy of
modern life would rather I ignore. It reminds me to slow down, and
tend to the little things.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I've resented my rosemary. It's big and it won't go away.
But I've never considered a serious pruning or a separation. The
herb is too central to my cooking, its aroma too closely tied to
the smell of coming home, its folk cures too automatic in our
household to deem dispensable.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've rejected the traditional role of rosemary _
the dominatrix of grilled food and heavy winter dishes. There's a
delicacy and a need to merge with other aromatics in the herb, a
perfume that's never fully realized when rosemary is allowed to
rampage alone in a dish.
</P>
<P>
   Used judiciously, rosemary performs a subtle magic to cooking.
The herb brings a hint forest and briny sea air, camphorlike and
breezy, to anything from wild game to delicate seafood, from pasta
and potatoes to custards and sorbet.
</P>
<P>
   But when the fresh herb is deployed with abandon, or when the
dried herb is used at all, rosemary is bad news: like a dark urge,
unrestrained. For this reason, the late Elizabeth David hated
rosemary.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen,'' she
wrote that ``rosemary figures in my kitchen as a decoration only,''
complaining of the lavish manner in which rosemary is used by some
Italians in marinades or stews: ``The meat is drowned in the acrid
taste of the herb, and the spiky little leaves get stuck between
your teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Mrs. David swooned for fresh fish basted with a branch
of green rosemary dipped in olive oil as it grilled. And therein
lies the difference between the dried herb and the fresh one: used
carefully, the fresh herb is neither acrid nor a dental nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned to restrain my rosemary impulse, dish by dish. But
the more I've learned about rosemary, the more dishes I seem to
crave with its piney, turpentine scent.
</P>
<P>
   Rosmarinus officinalis figured prominently in literature,
folklore and sacred texts long before 1390, when it was first
mentioned in ``The Forme of Cury,'' the earliest surviving culinary
text, as an essential element to salad.
</P>
<P>
   The herb's name was derived of two Latin words _ ros and marinus
_ meaning, respectively, dew and sea, perhaps because the plant
thrives under the harsh sun and in the sandy soil of the
Mediterranean. The climate in California and even along the Eastern
Seaboard also suits the herb, which seems to prefer its water
misted all over its leaves rather than drenched in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, my rosemary bush is happiest near the stove in
the winter, when soups and pasta water provide moist hot heat.
</P>
<P>
   Along with bay, thyme, savory, sage, marjoram, oregano and
lavender, rosemary is a among the plants some cooks call turpentine
herbs. Some botanists say that the herbs shared soil and climate
with seaside pines for so many millennia that they acquired a faint
piney flavor.
</P>
<P>
   If this speculation is true, the genetic imprint is very strong
indeed. On my terrace, my bush may be treated to nascent breezes
from the Hudson, but it is mainly exposed to exhaust fumes. Still,
its leaves continue to impart a sense of sea-meeting-woodland, a
whiff of Provence, of Italy and of the first time I ate in Chez
Panisse more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The aroma of rosemary is so potent that ancient texts referred
to it as incense, though perhaps this association has to do with
religious myths.
</P>
<P>
   In one, it is said that the Blessed Virgin laid the family's
laundry on rosemary shrubs to dry, lending a sacred aura to the
herb. Early Christian cults of the Virgin changed its name to Rose
(of) Mary. The church-and-herb connection may have fostered
rosemary's prominence in the herbal pharmacology practiced by
clerical healers.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, herbalists claim that rosemary promotes blood
circulation _ and when used in shampoos or, as in Curacao and
Spain, in a paste applied to a bald spot, encourages hair to grow.
Romans used rosemary pastes for nervous headaches and scholars wore
wreathes of fresh rosemary on their heads to improve memory.
</P>
<P>
   Memory, in fact, is the herb's attribute most celebrated in
poetry and old wive's tales. In medieval Europe, brides carried
rosemary branches in their wedding bouquets to remind their
husbands to be faithful. It is the herb most associated with
friendship and loyalty and, along with primrose and violets, was
used in bouquets carried by courting gentlemen, as well as in the
nosegays that women exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that scattering rosemary's tiny blue flowers in a bed
protects sleepers from bad dreams. And, in Cuba, a poultice of
rosemary and ginger is applied to the forehead to cure insomnia. In
some ancient food-cure systems, rosemary liniment is used to treat
rheumatism and gout.
</P>
<P>
   My family sips rosemary tea when we feel low, adds rosemary oil
to our bath water, uses rosemary soap and rosemary shampoo.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently we are not alone. The shelves of health food
stores and luxury bath shops seem to sprout more and more
rosemary-scented products every day.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, unbridled use of the herb is just as distasteful
in cosmetics as it is in cuisine. Rosemary needs to be melded, to
become a base note in an aromatic melange _ and kept on a very
tight leash.
</P>
<P>
   The herb provides an illusive bite, for instance, when used with
other aromatics to make soda (it is rumored to be an ingredient in
cola), snacks like chips with barbecue or ranch flavors, some
Belgian pilsners and even Chartreuse, the green liquor that
Carthusian monks have made since 1607.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the cook should use half as much rosemary as any
other spice or herb in a dish. Minced with thyme, and even
lavender, rosemary does wonderful things for lamb, veal, sausage
meat, game or beef. Using the herbs is like bringing the perfume of
grazing land back to the meat.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most commonly, rosemary is found, along with garlic and onion or
lemon, tucked into the cavity of chicken, with additional leaves
pushed between the bird's flesh and skin. It is delicious. And so
are roasted potatoes tossed with rosemary, olive oil, salt and
pepper; the same combination can be worked into dough for pizza,
focaccia or pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary seems to make tomato sauces sunnier and gives a lemony,
piney nuance to soups and stews.
</P>
<P>
   After years of living with rosemary, I finally began using it in
custards and sorbets and the result defied my general distrust of
using savory things in sweets. Used sparingly in milky desserts,
rosemary can function like pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon or allspice to
provide a sharp contrast to the sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Even more recently, I was surprised to detect rosemary among the
Asian aromatics in a vinaigrette served with a lobster and daikon
roll at the Vong restaurant in Manhattan. Soy and ginger seems to
coax a sweet hint of helioptrope from the herb.
</P>
<P>
   Modern cooks would not automatically think of consigning
rosemary to a bit part in a dish; parsimony in rosemary defies the
current more-is-better mindset in American cuisine. But living with
rosemary, I've found that the less you notice the bush, the more
powerful it is.
</P>
<P>
   My rosemary was, last fall, given an acid-bath by the
construction crew that was re-pointing our building. She had a
tough winter, and eventually I gave her to a friend for
safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Upon entering her temporary digs the other day, I was buffeted
with a sense of endurance and well-being and an urge to cook, to
bathe, to arrange flowers. If I knew how to sew, I would probably
have considered making cachets.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary, you see, abides like memories. And like the unnamed
sources of joy and sadness in any person's life, rosemary is best
as an unnoticed thread in the intricate and complicated fabric of a
life.
</P>
<P>
   SLOW-BRAISED TUNA IN ROSEMARY OIL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, 10 minutes, plus 4 to 24 hours' resting time
</P>
<P>
   1 quart olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 2-pound center cut piece of fresh tuna.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place olive oil in a saucepan over low heat. Wash rosemary
and pluck leaves from the stems (reserve the stems for grilling or
making kebabs). Dry the leaves in paper towels; you should have one
to one and a half cups.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place rosemary in the warming oil and continue to cook over
lowest possible heat until warm to the touch, about 15 minutes.
Remove from heat and allow to cool. Ladle half the oil into a very
clean glass container, leaving the rosemary behind.
</P>
<P>
   3. Place the second half of the oil in a blender with the
rosemary leaves and blend very well. Add this mixture to the glass
container and shake to combine. Place in the refrigerator for at
least 4 hours and up to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   4. Bring the oil to room temperature. Place the tuna in a small
but deep pan and pour the oil over to cover completely. Place over
low heat and cook 90 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to sit for
30 minutes. Drain tuna, discard the oil and cut the fish into six
steaks. Serve warm with boiled, parsley potatoes or use in nicoise
or tuna salad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

   ROSEMARY-SCENTED ASIAN LOBSTER SALAD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Vong &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   For the vinaigrette:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 half-inch piece ginger, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1 mild fresh chili, seeded, deveined and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups grape seed or other light, mild-tasting vegetable oil &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the salad:
</P>
<P>
   4 lobsters, cooked and shucked
</P>
<P>
   \ cup pickled ginger slices, patted dry and julienned
</P>
<P>
   8 radishes, sliced wafer thin
</P>
<P>
   1 cup daikon sprouts
</P>
<P>
   4 cups watercress, arugula or other bitter greens, rinsed, dried
and &QL;
</P>
<P>
   coarsely chopped.
</P>
<P>
   1. To make the vinaigrette, place all the ingredients but the
oil in a blender or food processor and puree. While still
processing, slowly drizzle a steady stream of oil into the mixture
to make a thick vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut the lobster meat into one-inch chunks. In a large bowl,
toss the lobster with the ginger, radish and sprouts and enough
vinaigrette to barely moisten the mixture (half to three-quarters
of a cup). Divide the bitter greens among four plates, place the
lobster mixture on top and top with the sprouts. Drizzle a little
additional vinaigrette over the greens and around them on the plate
and serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Note: Leftover vinaigrette makes a marvelous marinade for
chicken or pork.

 &HT;    AID OFFICIALS WANT REFUGEES ON THE MOVE FROM BORDER AREA
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-STRIKES-0512.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ After losing everything he owns, evading Serb
patrols for a month, seeing his eight-year-old cousin wounded by
shrapnel, and finally escaping Kosovo on Monday, excuse Mursel
Murseli if he does not wish to move yet again.
</P>
<P>
   But Murseli and more than 100,000 other refugees in this
northern region are being asked to travel deeper into Albania and
away from the potentially dangerous border with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations refugee organization, UNHCR and private aid
agencies began a tent-to-tent campaign Tuesday to persuade the
refugees to leave an area they fear could be targeted by Serb
artillery several miles away. They hope to send the first convoys
of refugees south on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It is a logistical nightmare for international relief workers,
who acknowledge that their efforts at persuasion are likely to
fail. They face widespread resistance from the ethnic Albanians,
who wish to remain close to the border and to their homes they
eventually hope to return to inside Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given us good reasons to stay. It is a hard sell, but
we must try because we fear they are targets here,'' said Ray
Wilkinson, spokesman for UNHCR in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, relief officials have sought to
transport newly arriving refugees to the south with the help of
trucks supplied by NATO, not allowing them to get settled in the
makeshift camps along the border region. On average, some 4,000 to
5,000 refugees a day have been using NATO transportation on???
their own vehicles to leave Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   But resettling the 100,000 refugees living in camps or with host
families is another matter. Problems coordinating transportation to
new camps still under construction in the south mean that aid
officials cannot now specifically tell the refugees where they
would go and how they would get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what to do. Where will they send us? I don't know
if it is safe,'' said Murseli, 32, a medical technician from the
Kosovo city of Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR and humanitarian relief agencies cannot force the refugees
to leave -- only the Albanian government has that authority -- and
they lack an adequate number of vehicles and supplies to move the
refugees 130 miles south to the capital, Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place simply is not sustainable for 100,000 refugees. As
the weather gets hotter, water is going to get scarce. Everyone
agrees that they must go. It's just a matter of how and when,''
said Pete Robinson of CARE International.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar refugees also are being moved from neighboring Macedonia
to Albania. The first busloads of refugees arrived at Korce in
Albania from overcrowded camps in Macedonia. The new camp can
accommodate up to 6,000, but refugees in Macedonia also have been
reluctant to leave.
</P>
<P>
   More than 750,000 ethnic Albanians have fled Kosovo in the past
seven weeks. Struggling to cope with Europe's largest refugee
crisis since World War II, UNHCR head Sadako Ogata appealed Tuesday
for donor countries to provide more money to the effort. UNHCR is
seeking $143 million to sustain its operations through the end of
June, but has only $71 million.
</P>
<P>
   In Kukes, at a camp of 7,000 refugees operated by Doctors
Without Borders -- one of eight camps in the area - officials used
loudspeakers Tuesday morning to broadcast the suggestion in
Albanian that the refugees move, warning them that it could be
unsafe if they remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just begged people, 'Please go.' It's not going to work.
You can't ask people to go, you must tell people to go,'' said
Shpendi Reda, an Albanian doctor who helps to manage the camp.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials suggest that the Kosovo Liberation Army, the KLA,
is pressuring the refugees to remain near the border as a source of
recruits for the guerrilla army and as cover for their training and
supply operations inside Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the danger looming just across the border in
Yugoslavia, NATO warplanes attacked Serb positions on Monday and
Tuesday within sight of the Morina border crossing.
</P>
<P>
   NATO jets high overhead pounded Serb military positions three
miles inside Kosovo just before noon, sending thick plumes of black
smoke rising above the green hills. Refugees fleeing Kosovo said
they believed a Yugoslav army base was hit.

 &HT;    INS ANNOUNCES REGULATIONS FOR HAITIAN REFUGEES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Some 50,000 Haitian refugees eligible to become
permanent residents of the United States can apply to change their
status beginning next month, under regulations being published
today by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible refugees -- primarily those who filed for asylum prior
to December 31, 1995 -- have until March 31, 2000, to apply for
permanent residency status. About 70 percent of those refugees live
in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The INS announced the regulations Tuesday at simultaneous news
conferences in Washington and Miami. The regulations are based on
the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act passed by Congress
last year and signed by President Clinton. Chief sponsors of the
act were Florida Sens. Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Connie Mack, a
Republican, and Rep. Carrie Meek, a Democrat from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Haitian refugees who applied for asylum or were
``paroled'' into the United States for emergency or safety reasons
prior to Dec. 31, 1995, the act applies to any Haitian who was a
child -- unmarried and under 21 -- prior to that date and arrived,
and remained, without parents after arrival or became orphaned
after arrival. It also would apply to any Haitian child abandoned
by parents or guardians prior to April 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   To be considered eligible, refugees must not have been outside
the United States for more than 180 days since Dec. 31, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians who had previously applied for asylum and had their
applications denied, and whose deportation orders have been issued,
will be granted a stay for 120 days after today to allow them to
apply for the permanent residency status.
</P>
<P>
   Meek estimated another 50,000 refugees who do not meet the
eligibility requirements also live in South Florida. INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner said they would be treated the same as
all other people who do not have legal status to remain in the
United States and are subject to deportation.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials plan later this week to begin training workers
from community organizations that deal with Haitians to enable them
to assist refugees in applying for the change in status.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of those eligible for a change in status already
have a temporary work permit, which expires in December.
</P>
<P>
   Applications may be obtained at INS offices around the country,
but must be mailed back to the agency's service center in Lincoln,
Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner said it could take a year to process applications.
Refugees would be allowed to continue working until their cases are
resolved.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Draggin' and braggin'
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Here's a story I heard in men's Sunday school
last week. It was told by the teacher to illustrate a passage from
the Book of Psalms that warns against boastfulness.
</P>
<P>
   This happened back in the 1950s. He was a young man in from
college.
</P>
<P>
   He had borrowed his family car and made a run down the main
drag, Timberland Drive, and then stopped off at a drive-in root
beer stand, a route so predictable that the car likely could have
driven itself.
</P>
<P>
   He stood around awhile with his buddies, and then they piled
into one of the other cars for a spin downtown to see if anything
was going on there.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen or 20 minutes later _ it doesn't take long to make the
rounds in a square town _ he was back at the root beer stand to
pick up his dad's car.
</P>
<P>
   Only thing was, the police had beat him to it.
</P>
<P>
   There they were, with the car hooked up to a wrecker and about
to tow it off when he intervened, asking what was the trouble,
Officer.
</P>
<P>
   Only to be told, you know doggone well what the trouble was,
that the car was going to be impounded and he was going to jail.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make the mistake of asking what the charge was. He'd
already been told he already knew.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he asked if he could use a phone to call his dad.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the cop said, you can use the phone _ you can use the
phone in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Almost before he knew it, he was in jail, still wondering what
he did and what was going to happen next.
</P>
<P>
   One of his buddies from the root beer stand showed up a short
time later, asking to see him.
</P>
<P>
   The cops said no, but the buddy yelled his name back down the
hall toward the cells, asking him if he wanted him to call his dad.
</P>
<P>
   He said, yeah, you better, not knowing what else to do.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the buddy had found out what he was charged with _
dragging on Timberland Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, he and another car had taken off from a red light,
tires squealing, right under the nose of a patrol car, which took
off after them.
</P>
<P>
   One fugitive went one way, and the other went the other way,
both managing to lose the cop, who doubled back around checking the
usual hangouts for the usual suspects, and that's when he spotted
the car he was sure was one of the draggers.
</P>
<P>
   So it was the buddy phoned the father.
</P>
<P>
   ``What'd they arrest him for?'' his daddy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dragging,'' the buddy said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the daddy to show up at the jail. He
managed to get the car and his boy, too, out on bail. He was angry,
and the boy was scared.
</P>
<P>
   Surprising enough _ since this was a law-and-order, no-nonsense
kind of father who well knew his son's many failings _ in this case
the father was angry with the police and not with the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Doggonedest thing he'd ever heard of, he sputtered. Arresting a
boy for bragging.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake was understandable.
</P>
<P>
   1. His dad couldn't hear well on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   2. His dad had never heard of dragging.
</P>
<P>
   The moral is: Even when it's something else, boastfulness can
get you in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   P.S. He still says he wasn't dragging.

NO. 2 WINE OF GREAT BORDEAUX CHATEAUX MADE WITH ALL THE CARE OF THE
FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can't afford Chateau Margaux any more? Or Chateau Latour, or
Chateau Any-Other-Famous-Bordeaux? Have you thought of trying your
favorite chateau's second wine?
</P>
<P>
   The principal wine of any Bordeaux chateau is the one that bears
its name. But every vineyard produces some grapes that are better
than others. Some chateaus mix all their grapes together and
ferment them into a single wine. But that practice is dying out.
</P>
<P>
   The result is the growing class of second wines, which may not
be made from the best of grapes, but do come from the finest
houses. They are worth knowing about because for a relatively low
price _ $50 compared with $240 in one example _ you are buying the
expertise of the great winemakers of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Second labels are mostly a Bordeaux phenomenon, closely
associated with the chateau system, although winemakers around the
world have resorted to separate names for lesser wines from their
principal vineyards. The difference is that outside Bordeaux, the
second label doesn't have a consistent meaning.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in most places _ Italy, Spain, Latin America and
California _ the second wine can be the better wine. For example,
the very best cabernet sauvignon from Robert Mondavi Winery is
designated a ``reserve'' wine to set it apart from the regular
bottlings.
</P>
<P>
   But to confuse matters, many more California wineries use terms
like reserve, proprietor's reserve or winemaker's reserve as
meaningless designations on inexpensive, commercial wines they buy
in bulk. Mostly, they are just dressing up the label.
</P>
<P>
   But in Bordeaux, the meaning of a second label is very specific.
Few Bordeaux vineyards are a single entity surrounding the chateau
whose name they bear. Many family-owned vineyards have been cut up
over the years to satisfy the demands of France's draconian
inheritance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Some chateaus have as many as 40 separate parcels of vines
spread around the commune in which they are located. A map of most
chateaus' vineyard holdings will look like a patchwork quilt.
</P>
<P>
   Because these parcels often have different soil, different
irrigation, even different microclimates, they are harvested and
vinified separately. What's more, within each parcel of vines, the
different grape varieties also will be picked and vinified
separately.
</P>
<P>
   The result is many different vats of wine. The best go into the
principal wine, called the grand vin; the rest go into the second
wine, also known as the second label. Thirty years ago, when Edmund
Penning-Rowsell wrote ``The Wines of Bordeaux,'' the first
important book on the subject in English, he barely mentioned
second wines. The sixth edition of his book (Penguin, 1989), lists
dozens of them.
</P>
<P>
   Some second wines are well known. Les Forts de Latour, the
second wine of Chateau Latour, is better known than the first wines
of many other chateaus. So is Bahans-Haut-Brion of Chateau
Haut-Brion, Pavillon Rouge of Chateau Margaux, Amiral de
Beychevelle of Chateau Beychevelle and Carruades de Lafite of
Chateau Lafite-Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   In Bordeaux, second wines are usually, but not always, the
product of young vines. A good grapevine maintains its vigor for 35
to 40 years before it is replaced. Almost every Bordeaux chateau
has sections of new or young vines whose fruit is no match for that
produced by mature vines.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, different portions of a vineyard produce different
quality fruit. Some parts could have been damaged by hail, for
example, while others remained untouched. Then, too, the grapes
mature at different times: merlot is usually first, followed by
cabernet sauvignon and, even later, cabernet franc and petit
verdot. Each variety is picked separately and fermented
individually.
</P>
<P>
   Even a moderate size modern chateau may have as many as 30
fermentation vats to accommodate the different batches of grapes.
The blending process, called the assemblage, determines how much
wine will go into the first wine and how much into the second.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, economics steps in. At a great property, owned by
a Parisian banker or an insurance company, prestige will always
outweigh profit. If half the year's production is deemed even
slightly inferior, it will go into the second wine or will be sold
off in bulk. There have been years when some chateaus deemed none
of their wine good enough for the grand vin.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser property, whose owner makes his living from his wine,
may not be able to afford the luxury of such severe selection.
Consequently, his wine is not as good as it might be were he able
to reject some of his lesser vats.
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Lichine, the late wine writer and owner of Chateau
Prieure'-Lichine in Margaux, once observed: ``Rigorous selection is
what really permits the large properties in Bordeaux to be very
discriminating, thus enabling them to make the top wines. Selling
part of your production at half-price is a discipline demanding a
sacrifice that not many chateaus are willing, or can afford, to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Bordeaux-loving consumer, buying a second label is a
question of perceived value. The 1995 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild
currently sells in New York for about $240 a bottle. The chateau's
second wine, Carruades de Lafite, sells for about $50 _ not a bad
price for a wine from Lafite-Rothschild in today's overheated
market.
</P>
<P>
   But is the Carruades better than, say, Chateau Pichon-Baron, a
grand vin also from the commune of Pauillac, and also about $50?
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the price spread between a chateau's first and second
wine is not so great. While a 1994 Chateau Haut-Brion will cost
around $135 and the Bahans-Haut-Brion of the same vintage about
$33, the Chateau Lagrange 1995, from St. Julien, sells for about
$40 and the second wine, Les Fiefs de Lagrange, from the same year,
is priced at about $25.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the second wine of a famous chateau will have been
made with all the care and skill of the first wine. Some second
wines develop a passionate following of their own. But most live in
the reflected glory of their famous siblings; good wines, yes, but
not necessarily better than lesser-known chateaus whose first wines
sell for the same prices.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my own favorites among the seconds would include the
Fiefs de Lagrange, mentioned above; two St. Estephes _ Frank
Phelan, the second of Chateau Phelan Segur, and Les Pagodes de Cos,
the second of Chateau Cos d'Estournel _ and Clos de Marquis, the
second of Chateau Leoville Las Cases.
</P>
<P>
   The second wine of Chateau Mouton-Rothschild can be delicious,
too, but it is made in tiny quantities and is rarely seen. It's
called Le Petit Mouton, but there is nothing petit about it.

RICH CHILEAN

<TEXT>
<P>
   Errazuriz Chardonnay Reserva 1996, Casablanca Valley, Chile.
About $15.
</P>
<P>
   The Casablanca Valley is only a few miles from the Pacific
Ocean, which has the same moderating effect on the vines that it
does on California vineyards. But the climate and the soil, sandy
loam, produce a different style chardonnay from that of California
vines.
</P>
<P>
   The wine is intense and rich but displays less of the buttery,
over-oaked quality of California chardonnays.
</P>
<P>
   The weather in these Chilean vineyards was cooler than normal in
1996 and produced wines with higher acidity, a decided asset. It
is, as it should be, a wine for food and not an aperitif.
</P>
<P>
   The style is restrained, and while it retains its own character,
it should appeal to devotees of white Burgundy.

SAN FRANCISCO CONSIDERS LONGER WALK TIMES FOR PEDESTRIAN SIGNALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Citing the record number of pedestrian
fatalities in San Francisco last year, a city official wants to
give people more time to cross the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rash of pedestrian fatalities and serious injuries over
the past year is of grave concern to me,'' Supervisor Mabel Teng
said Monday. ``Extending pedestrian walking times citywide will
save lives. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   She has introduced legislation urging the Department of Parking
and Traffic to reset the timing of traffic signals to give
pedestrians a walking speed of 2.5 feet per second, rather than the
standard 4 feet per second suggested by federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical 50-foot-wide San Francisco street, a pedestrian
under Teng's plan would get nearly 21 seconds to cross, rather than
12.5 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998, a record 41 pedestrians
were hit and killed by vehicles on the streets of San Francisco,
compared with 23 pedestrian deaths during the previous 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the fatalities were the fault of drivers, according
to police records. In 18 of the fatalities, pedestrians were found
at fault because they jaywalked or disregarded red lights.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Sunshine, chief of the Department of Parking and Traffic,
said Teng wouldn't have to do much urging to get longer crossing
times for pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine's agency already has been working on the effort to
increase crossing times at intersections. He said some signals
already had been altered near senior residential complexes in parts
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Implementing the program citywide, Sunshine said, ``is doable.''
</P>
<P>
   But with every upside, there's a downside. In this case,
motorists would have longer waits and that could mean more traffic
congestion, Sunshine said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Teng's legislation, some signals would be exempted if the
longer cross times would cause more vehicular congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for senior citizens and disabled people have lobbied
for years to get more time to cross the street at intersections
with signals.

 &HT;    `Nanny' pre-empted by `Raymond' reruns
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What could be more pleasantly soothing than Fran Drescher's
normal speaking voice?
</P>
<P>
   Why, Fran Drescher screaming in labor pains, of course. Either
that, or rubbing a cheese grater on a bad sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   The final episode of ``The Nanny'' gives us only the first, even
though it frequently feels like the second.
</P>
<P>
   Has there ever been a more unlikely star than Drescher, with her
nasal bray, her annoying laugh, her whining-as-humor, her penchant
for wearing lacy peekaboo dresses in public and then complaining
about the paparazzi? She's like the Zsa Zsa of the '90s _ famous,
but why?
</P>
<P>
   Several seasons ago in its six-year run, ``The Nanny'' served
CBS well enough, gathering a fairly loyal fan base. But that base
had deserted it of late, and CBS slapped the show by pre-empting
the last five episodes for reruns of ``Everybody Loves Raymond.''
Now, with what seems to be a sigh of relief, comes a one-hour
finale, and then it's finally over.
</P>
<P>
   So Fran Fine, as Drescher is called on the show, is pregnant
with twins. Naturally, this is cause for whining, about her size,
her hunger, waiting for the birth. ``Just try to get a Jewish kid
to leave his mother,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In time-honored sitcom tradition, she goes into labor on a stuck
elevator. The twins are born, one girl, one boy, and then it's time
to cue the final montage of clips from six seasons of ``The
Nanny,'' set to ``The Way We Were.'' Some approaches can be simply
breathtaking in their obviousness.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, some people are fans of Drescher. In today's vast pop
culture hyper-mart, anything or anybody can pick up some kind of
fan base, the way black pants pick up lint: Howard Stern, Adam
Sandler movies, the Spice Girls, Pauly Shore.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also a place waiting for the Zsa Zsas of the '90s:
Old Navy commercials. Here's hoping that when Drescher gets cast,
she's in one of those where the celebs barely speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nanny.''

 &HT;    HOUSING DEPARTMENT TO SELL PROJECT AGAIN
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington category
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If the third time wasn't a charm, then perhaps the
fourth will be. That's what the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development promised in announcing plans to unload Clifton
Terrace, one of its oldest white elephants.
</P>
<P>
   The decaying apartment complex, an example of low-income housing
policy gone awry, is being sold for $1 plus a government promise to
give the new owners $8.2 million for renovations. Housing Secretary
Andrew Cuomo predicted in late April that the transfer would be ``a
new beginning for the families of Clifton Terrace and the
surrounding neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a short drive from the U.S. Capitol, the project typifies
problems in the federal housing law's ``Section 8'' program, which
provides subsidized rents for the poor in privately owned
properties. With lax oversight from housing authorities, landlords
have had little incentive to maintain buildings. Federal auditors
surveying the 8,600 such properties nationwide have found $10
billion in needed repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Terrace has been among the worst cases. Since 1968, the
federal government has financed three different purchasers, only to
retake the property because the landlords took millions of dollars
in federal rent subsidies and allowed the apartments to
deteriorate. The most recent owner collected $31 million in rent
subsidies over 13 years before declaring the property to be
bankrupt, leaving undone nearly $4 million in maintenance work.
</P>
<P>
   Housing department officials in late April chose Michaels
Development Co. of Malton, N.J., and the non-profit Community
Preservation and Development Corp. of Bethesda, Md., to overhaul
the project.
</P>
<P>
   The designated new co-owners have agreed to make $16 million
worth of improvements, reduce the density from 289 units to 232
units for low- and moderate-income housing and develop 76
condominium units. They are scrambling to complete the deal within
the next two months. The government will not guarantee the
financing.
</P>
<P>
   The developers would need about 24 months to renovate Clifton
Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   By the mid 1990s, the three-tower project was a rat-invested
magnet for crime and a nightly echo chamber for gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the neighborhood is undergoing a renaissance, but the
three-acre project continues to be a detriment and a drain on
public funds that for more than a year have been used to operate
nearly vacant buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a negative, negative history,'' said Lessie Powell
Evans, vice president for Community Preservation. ``Some people
just say tear it down.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she insists that the three high rises, once fashionable
residences that have extraordinary vistas of the city, are worth
saving.
</P>
<P>
   Community Preservation has promised to provide services that
include child care, computer literacy programs and job training.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every spring, when the urge to grow sets in, New
Yorkers carry home pots of herbs, imagining a garden on the
windowsill where fresh basil and dill can be plucked with abandon.
And every summer both hopes and herbs wither and die. The
inclination is always to blame a black thumb. But herbs are like
people: Not all thrive in an urban environment.
</P>
<P>
   It is undeniably worth the effort to grow herbs on your
windowsill. A Tiny Tim tomato plant or a pot of lettuce in a sunny
kitchen window is easy enough to nurture, but one small salad and
the season's over. Herbs, on the other hand, with their
concentrated flavor and minimal measurements, offer a harvest of
some duration, and they can add fragrance to a room as well.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh herbs on your windowsill, the whole approach to
cooking changes. If chives are growing right there in front of you,
it's so easy to snip a few right into an omelet. If cilantro is
growing out where you can see it, it can't be wilting and turning
slimy in the bottom of the vegetable crisper.
</P>
<P>
   Not all herbs will grow well indoors, and not all indoors are
suitable for growing herbs. The two primary limitations are light
and heat _ not enough of the former and far too much of the latter.
Most herbs are of a temperate nature, and New York's dry,
superheated apartments easily overwhelm them. Herbs like it cool.
At the very least they need to cool off at night, preferring
temperatures in the low 70s or below.
</P>
<P>
   Light is a less crucial factor, because you can always
supplement with special grow lights. This no longer means klutzy
fluorescent fixtures dangling over your pots. These days you can
get special broad-spectrum grow bulbs for track lights (only you
and your decorator will know). Any good hardware store will also
carry normal-looking clip-on or hanging lamps that can be fitted
with plant bulbs, either reflectors that can be angled directly
onto herbs or the glow type that shed light over a wide area.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plants themselves, forget about basil, no matter how
tempting the new varieties like lemon and Thai might be, unless you
can offer a full day of sunlight or are willing to leave the lights
on 12 hours a day. Even then, basil grown indoors is prone to
spider mites unless you mist it as frequently as you brush your
teeth. On the other hand, if you happen to be one of those New
Yorkers in the highly unusual position of having a sunny bathroom,
this would be absolutely the best indoor environment you could
offer this herb, because of the high humidity usually found there.
</P>
<P>
   Lovage and chervil do well in rather poor light but are not the
most versatile herbs for cooking. Lovage is prized primarily for
its strong celerylike flavor, and chervil, which has a very subtle
flavor, is one of the fines herbes in classic French omelets. The
windowsill offers limited acreage, so herbs with more demand from
the resident chef probably make better use of the territory.
</P>
<P>
   The easy six for a windowsill herb garden are rosemary, bay,
mint, parsley, thyme and chives. The first three need only moderate
light, say two hours of direct sunlight a day; the second three are
a little more demanding, needing at least three to four hours of
direct sunlight. Cilantro can be grown like parsley, but dill and
sage need more light than a windowsill can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Most herbs can be started from seed, but you will have better
luck with chives already prestarted in a pot. Buying herbs in pots
is always easiest, especially now that even supermarkets carry
them. For pot size, obviously you can't grow a 3-foot thyme plant
in a 3-inch pot. You need about an inch in diameter for each three
inches of plant. Herbs should be fertilized regularly with a dilute
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary is particularly attractive as a windowsill herb because
it can be trained into a miniature orb. I once bought rosemary
spears at the supermarket with kebabs in mind and stuck them in a
glass of water to keep them fresh. A week later, Kebab Saturday
having been rained out, the unused stems had rooted. Our son,
Revell, planted them in a pot, bent the stems over into arches and
tied the tips together with green florist's wire. Rosemary's new
growth proceeds vertically, but I trim these tips off to season
chicken or lamb or fish, and Revell's topiary ball just gets fuller
and richer with every season.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet bay, like rosemary, is a perennial, so once you have an
established pot plant it becomes part of your eternal spice shelf.
A fresh bay leaf can be used in soups and stews and more. This is a
hardy plant, resistant to most pests, except scale, which can
readily be removed with soapy water. Bay will outgrow the
windowsill, though: It can become a small tree, up to 4 feet tall
indoors. Harvest the leaves from the top if you want to keep the
herb down to bush size, or from the sides if you want the more
treelike configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Mint is nice to have around just for the pleasure of pinching
off a leaf every now and then and inhaling, though, of course, it's
great for mint juleps and as a garnish for lamb or strawberries.
For best results, use a very loose soil mixture. A seed-starting
mix is excellent, because it holds moisture well, and mints do not
take well to dry soil. There's a reason they tend to grow near
water meters and dripping faucets.
</P>
<P>
   Parsley, unlike the other five of the easy six, is a biennial,
and so you should either start new seeds every year or buy a new
plant. The trick to growing parsley as a pot plant is always to
pinch the outermost stems from around the crown. This will force
continuous fresh growth from the center.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon thyme makes for a special flavor not readily bought at a
store, although the common thyme, Thymus vulgaris, is more readily
available as a plant and easier to grow to boot. Your window will
really smell like an herb garden when the sun shines on thyme, no
matter which variety you grow. The soil for thyme should be
slightly alkaline (crush some eggshells into your potting mixture)
and allowed to become rather dry, though not bone-dry, between
waterings.
</P>
<P>
   Chives like a rich, constantly moist soil. Given these
conditions and a reasonable amount of light, they will reward you
with an abundant harvest. But you must keep trimming back the
plants, or the young spears will become tough as they mature. If
the plant gets away from you and matures, it will send out pretty
little balls of purple flowers. The flowers look striking, and
these living Koosh balls are great in salads.

MRS. SHEPARD URGES CONGRESS TO PROTECT GAYS IN HATE CRIME LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: New material throughout.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Judy Shepard, urging Congress to expand the federal
hate crimes law to protect homosexuals from violence, speculated
Tuesday that her son Matthew may not have been killed outside
Laramie, Wyo., last year if there had been such a law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I would not have to be here today, talking about how my
son was savagely beaten, tied to a fence and left to die in
freezing temperatures,'' Mrs. Shepard said. ``Matt is no longer
with us today because the men who killed him learned to hate.''
</P>
<P>
   She told the Senate Judiciary Committee how her son Matthew, who
was a 21-year-old student at the University of Wyoming, was beaten
last October simply because he was gay. She urged the panel to
approve legislation that would broaden the federal hate crimes law
to protect gays.
</P>
<P>
   The current hate crimes law, which was passed in 1969, allows
the federal government to prosecute crimes against people based on
race, color, religion or national origin. The law also requires
that any victim must have been participating in at least one of six
``federally protected activities'' such as attending a public
school, serving as a juror or being present in a public space such
as a park.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of senators, including Sens. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass., and Arlen Specter, R-Pa., recently introduced legislation
that would expand the federal hate crimes law to include gender,
disability and sexual orientation. It would also eliminate the
federal protected activities language from the current law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly Congress needs to do more to address the issue of hate
crimes,'' Kennedy said. ``Few crimes tear more deeply at the fabric
of our society than hate crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shepard said she realizes that a new law may not have
prevented Matthew's death, but ``perhaps these murders would have
gotten the message that this country does not tolerate
hate-motivated violence.''
</P>
<P>
   She told lawmakers that enactment of the law would be worth it
``if even one family can avoid getting that phone call in the
middle of the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Most hate crimes are prosecuted at the state and local level but
U.S. Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder said the federal hate
crimes statue allows the federal government to give state and local
officials assistance. Such assistance includes using the Federal
Bureau of Investigation to investigate such crimes and provide
technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Holder said that only about six hate crimes per year are
prosecuted at the federal level. He also said local law enforcement
agencies reported 8,049 hate crimes in 1997, or about one per hour.
</P>
<P>
   In the Shepard case, Wyoming authorities charged Russell
Henderson and Aaron McKinney, both 21, with murder and kidnapping
under state law. Henderson pleaded guilty to murder last month and
is currently serving two life sentences in prison. McKinney is
awaiting trial, which is set to begin Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson and McKinney met Shepard in a bar on Oct. 7 and lured
him outside, kidnapped and pistol-whipped him. They left Shepard
tied to a fence outside of town in freezing temperatures. Shepard
was found the next day and hospitalized but died five days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Matt's room at the hospital what we found was a motionless,
unaware young man with his head swathed in bandages, his face
covered with stitches, and tubes everywhere,'' Mrs. Shepard said.
``One of his eyes was partially open, but the twinkle of life
wasn't there anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, said he was concerned that the legislation was too
broadly written and could allow rape cases to be prosecuted at the
federal level under the proposed gender provisions of hate crimes
bill.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``I am very concerned that we are not doing
everything we should do'' and promised to craft a more
narrowly-targeted bill.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy countered that states would still continue to take the
lead role in prosecuting hate crimes, but ``the full power of the
federal government should also be available to investigate,
prosecute and punish these crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shepard said, at a minimum, the legislation would ``make a
powerful statement and help create a climate of a more tolerant
America.''

THAT ELUSIVE FLAVOR? SUGAR

<P>
   This may seem a little odd for a sugar lover to say, but I don't
like my sugar to be too sweet. Sugar connoisseurs, who appreciate
the many qualities a great sugar can bring to a dish, know exactly
what I mean.
</P>
<P>
   Too much sweetness can destroy all that is good in sugar,
overpowering the subtleties of its many flavors and perfumes.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there is much more to reap from a sugar than sweetness,
like richness of texture, a molasses bouquet and an old-fashioned
aroma. These are qualities only brown sugar can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Brown sugar links me to my baking ancestors. I remember the
creamy brown sugar frosting my great-grandmother Daisy Pearce
smoothed onto her devil's-food cake, and the moist brown sugar
hermits and chess pies of other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   While older cookbooks, like the original ``Joy of Cooking,''
have numerous recipes for brown sugar dishes, there is a dearth of
recipes featuring this homey ingredient in recent cookbooks. But
that does not mean the passion and inventiveness of brown sugar's
partisans have waned.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Desaulniers, the author of ``Death by Chocolate,'' uses
brown sugar in a number of the recipes, including the Chocolate
Phantasmagoria, a rich dessert. Shirley Corriher, a food writer,
sprinkles it on cooked carrots to give them a sweet-potato flavor.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly is the object of such affection? Brown sugar is
simply white sugar from sugar beets or sugar cane that has been
refined and coated with molasses. At least, that is the type that
is commonly found on supermarket shelves. But there are also
sugars, new to most Americans, that are so good they just might
revive interest in cooking with brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   These sugars _ muscovado, Demerara and golden baker's _ come
primarily from the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. Made
from cane sugar grown in volcanic ash, they are not refined down to
white sugar, so they retain much of their natural molasses. These
sugars have a depth and complexity of flavor the supermarket brands
can't touch.
</P>
<P>
   Muscovado comes in light and dark, and has a consistency similar
to store-bought brown sugar. The light version has a velvety,
lingering molasses flavor and is so versatile it can be used as a
replacement for both light and dark commercial brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The dark muscovado is a pungent treat that tastes of rum. It is
a trickier sugar to use _ its intensity might take some getting
used to _ but it can add a nicely decadent touch to barbecue sauces
and cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   Demerara is a brown crystallized sugar that is both light in its
texture and deep in its hints of molasses. It is especially good as
a topping _ sprinkled on a creme brulee, for example _ and can add
a bit of crunch to pie or tart dough.
</P>
<P>
   Golden baker's sugar has a lush granulated texture and a soft
and subtle, almost floral, flavor that makes it ideal as an
all-purpose sugar. Of the three, it is the most easily used as a
replacement for white sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a length of flavor in these sugars,'' said Nancy
Pollard, the owner of La Cuisine, a cooks' supply store in
Alexandria, Va. She uses muscovado when she makes chocolate ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Levy Beranbaum, the author of ``The Cake Bible,'' now uses
golden baker's sugar in dessert recipes, except for things like
meringue, where it would darken the color. When she discovered it
in Britain years ago, she said, she was struck by its ``purity of
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   I make the simplest of cookies using muscovado or golden
baker's. I do not add spices or even vanilla, preferring to let the
flavor of these sugars stand on their own and give the cookies an
elusive, deep, lingering flavor.
</P>
<P>
   These sugars are increasingly available in specialty shops, for
about $5 for a one-pound bag. In New York, Dean &AMP; DeLuca, the
Vinegar Factory and Eli's Manhattan carry Mauritius sugars imported
by the India Tree Co., a Seattle wholesaler (800-369-4848).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Simpson &AMP; Vail, a tea company in Connecticut, sells its own
brand of these sugars by mail order (800-282-8327), and also
supplies it to stores, including Zabar's and Balducci's. La Cuisine
sells India Tree sugars by mail order (800-521-1176). Demerara in
cube form, made by Gilway, is available in some markets.
</P>
<P>
   Golden baker's and Demerara sugar can be kept in the same way
that refined sugars can, but the muscovado can clump and grow hard
just as commercial brown sugar does. There are various techniques
for keeping sugar moist, but you can simply keep the sugar in an
airtight container and when ready to use, pour it into a bowl and
place a damp towel over it.
</P>
<P>
   Once you have tasted what brown sugar can be, it may be
difficult to go back to the commercial brands. These Mauritius
sugars could be the new stars of the kitchen. Pastry chefs, are you
ready?

RESENDING FOR GREEN BAY NEWS CHRONICLE 
 IF IT AIN'T BROKE . . .  
 RETALIATION SHOULD BE LEFT IN THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   At what point exactly did baseball decide to put restraints on
its players and no longer allow them to play the game the way it
has been played for decades?
</P>
<P>
   Last week's incident between the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis
Cardinals demonstrates how baseball's umpires, possibly at the
urging of the commissioner's office, are taking a step backward
rather than forward.
</P>
<P>
   This is a touchy subject to most casual baseball fans because
they believe any form of violence is wrong. So when Braves starter
 &UR; Greg
 &UR; Maddux drilled St. Louis'  &UR; Ray Lankford two pitches after Mark
McGwire hit a grand slam, the Cardinals rightly took exception.
</P>
<P>
   But when home plate umpire  &UR; Larry Poncino warned Cardinals
pitcher
 &UR; Kent Mercker before the start of the next inning not to throw at
any Braves players, he basically took away the one way St. Louis
could retaliate, which is to have its pitcher plunk a Braves player
and square things.
</P>
<P>
   It may sound barbaric, but it's the way the game has been played
since the start of the century _ you hit one of our guys on
purpose, we're going to do the same to one of yours.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not one of the problems baseball has,'' said Cincinnati
Manager  &UR; Jack McKeon, who has been involved in major league ball as
a player, coach, manager or general manager for 50 years. ``To me,
that's the way you play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing now is that hitters don't think a pitcher can
come inside at all. They get an inside pitch, and they're ready to
charge the mound. I'd love to see one of these guys charge someone
like  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Gibson,  &UR; Sal Maglie or  &UR; Don Drysdale. Those pitchers would kill
these hitters. But today, there's a different breed of player.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just the way the game is played. The one time players
should take exception to being hit is when a ball comes in toward
the head, where serious damage can occur. But pitchers such as
Drysdale would drill a hitter in the ribs _ a spot that would hurt
for weeks, causing that hitter to curse Drysdale for weeks.
Drysdale hit 154 batters during his career.
</P>
<P>
   Retaliation should never be taken away in the game of baseball.
But now it has gotten to the point where the first club to strike
gets away with it because they simply plead innocence. In fact,
rarely are such instances innocent.
</P>
<P>
   They'll never admit it, but every single major league manager
has ordered one of his pitchers to hit an opposing batter at some
point in his career. It's truly an inside part of the game of
baseball. &QL; 
Trivial question &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Who holds the club record for home runs by an Atlanta Braves
player? &QL; 
Rocket fuel &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Toronto assistant general manager  &UR; Dave Stewart, one of the
fiercest competitors of the last quarter-century and one of the
most stand-up men in the game, is still quarreling with former Blue
Jays pitcher  &UR; Roger Clemens, who basically demanded to be traded
away from Toronto because he didn't deem the Blue Jays capable of
competing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our club as a whole feels we're a better club without Roger,''
Stewart said. ``I don't believe Roger is conducive to winning. He's
more of a guy that's good at accomplishing individual goals, but I
don't believe he's capable of bringing a team to a championship.
The proof is in the pudding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not done it in Boston. He came to Toronto, and he didn't
do it there. The situation in New York _ it's not that he would
bring a championship there, but he'd be riding the coattails of a
club that can do it without him.''
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted that Clemens signed with Toronto two winters
ago after the Blue Jays made the highest offer for his services
and, at the time, he said he was there to help bring back glory to
the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It should also be noted that in 10 career meetings between
Clemens and Stewart (which includes the playoffs), Clemens never
once beat Stewart, who was 7-0 in those match-ups against Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Blue Jays do not appear to be the dregs of the
league, which is how some interpreted Clemens' painting of the
club. &QL; 
Credit where it's due &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just how good are the Cleveland Indians, owners of the best
record in baseball entering this weekend's series? Consider who
they have let go as a barometer of where they are at.
</P>
<P>
   Since the middle of the 1996 season, the Indians have seen
several top players leave either via trade or free agency, yet they
remain perched near the top of the 30 clubs in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list of former Indians and where they are:  &UR; Albert
Belle, Baltimore's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Matt Williams, Arizona's
cleanup hitter;
 &UR; Jeromy Burnitz, Milwaukee's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Jeff Kent, San
Francisco's cleanup hitter;  &UR; Brian Giles, Pittsburgh's No. 3
hitter;  &UR; Sean Casey, Cincinnati's No. 3 hitter; and  &UR; Marquis
Grissom, Milwaukee's No. 7 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to pitching, the list is also somewhat impressive.
It includes  &UR; Gregg Olson, Arizona's closer;  &UR; Jose Mesa, Seattle's
closer;
 &UR; Danny Graves, Cincinnati's closer; and  &UR; Chad Ogea, Philadelphia's
No. 3 starter.
</P>
<P>
   What did the Indians receive in exchange? Three players on their
current roster: third baseman  &UR; Travis Fryman and pitchers  &UR; Dave
Burba and  &UR; Steve Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever  &UR; Ricky Rincon (he no longer wishes to be called
Ricardo) was also acquired in a trade, but he remains on the
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   All of these moves are courtesy of General Manager  &UR; John Hart.
Say whatever you want about him or his ego, but Hart remains one of
the very best at his craft. &QL; 
Bleacher creatures &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs management is promising a strict crackdown after
fans in the most famous bleachers in baseball inundated Wrigley
Field with half-filled beer cups, glass flasks of booze and full
cans of soda. The protests came about after a bad umpire's call
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing all of our options, including more security,
stationing personnel in different places, alcohol limits and other
opportunities available to us,'' said  &UR; Mark McGuire, the team's
executive vice president. ``I would suspect we will do some things
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cubs officials are caught in a tough spot because
they do not want to ruin the Wrigley Field bleachers for what they
are _ a great place to watch a ballgame. Yet, they realize they
must maintain some form of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's arguably the highest-demand seat in baseball,'' McGuire
said. ``We're caught trying to figure out the right way to do it.
Unfortunately, some of (the littering) is becoming part of the
tradition or culture of Wrigley Field, and it's one we would like
to lose quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Cubs reliever  &UR; Rod Beck, known for indulging from time to time,
offered this opinion:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for having a good time myself and having a few pops,
but not for wasting beer by throwing it onto the field. I'd rather
drink it than throw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) they were throwing bottles and full pop cans and
baseballs. You're talking a guy's livelihood. What happens if
someone gets an eye put out?'' &QL; 
Trivial answer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before you jump to the presumably obvious, think about how the
questions was phrased. It asked the Atlanta Braves player with the
most home runs.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is  &UR; Dale Murphy, who had 371 career home runs in an
Atlanta uniform.  &UR; Hank Aaron hit 335 for Atlanta but is the
all-time Braves franchise leader with 733 home runs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Canning his emotions: Detroit's  &UR; Bobby Higginson was so frustrated
after a game last weekend that he took his bat and whacked the
toilet repeatededly. The next day, he hit two doubles and a single
in his first three at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The newest member of the Jack Lord Fan Club: Pittsburgh catcher
 &UR; Jason Kendall became only the seventh player since 1970 (as far
back as they can check) to have a box score line of 5-0-5-0. He had
five hits in five at-bats and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Mackey Sasser.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And now, your Montreal EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEExpos!: Teammates, and
brothers,  &UR; Vladimir and  &UR; Wilton Guerrero have combined for 16
errors this season, nine by right fielder Vladimir.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Milestone week for managers: Three managers reached significant
victories in the past week. Los Angeles'  &UR; Davey Johnson got victory
No. 1,000, Cincinnati's  &UR; Jack McKeon notched No. 600 and Anaheim's
 &UR; Terry Collins got No. 400. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
Giants second baseman  &UR; Jeff Kent became just the second player ever
to hit for the cycle (single, double, triple and home run in the
same game) at Pittsburgh's Three Rivers Stadium last week. The
other was  &UR; Joe Torre, who accomplished the feat in 1973 as a member
of the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rafael Palmeiro of the Texas Rangers is at opposite ends of the
spectrum when it comes to batting against left-handers and
right-handers, entering the weekend series. His .441 (30 for 68)
average against right-handers is the best in the American League.
Conversely, his .083 (2 for 24) average against left-handers is the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty early for such projections, but Atlanta's  &UR; Bret
Boone, who has five home runs and 18 RBIs, is on pace to become the
first Braves second baseman ever to have 30 home runs and 100 RBIs
in a season.
</P>
<P>
   The experiment in Pittsburgh is over, and catcher
 &UR; Jason Kendall has returned to the middle of the lineup. After
becoming one of the few catchers ever to lead off, Kendall was
dropped to fifth in the order. While in the top spot, though,
Kendall distinguished himself, batting .274 with seven stolen bases
in eight attempts. His .366 on-base percentage wasn't bad, either.
 &UR; Al Martin is the new leadoff hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The two pitchers tied for the most complete games in the
National League with two come from the Diamondbacks and Phillies.
As expected,  &UR; Randy Johnson is the name from Arizona. The one from
Philadelphia, however, might be surprising since it is  &UR; Carlton
Loewer, not  &UR; Curt Shilling, who mopped up in the category last
season with 15.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's  &UR; John Smoltz, who is 5-0 with a 1.69 ERA, won the
second Pitcher of the Month award of his career. Coincidentally,
the other time he won was also in April. The year was 1996, when he
won the league's Cy Young Award. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
Minnesota closer  &UR; Rick Aguilera continues to be closely monitored
by Atlanta scouts. Word is that Aguilera will waive his no-trade
clause if a deal is stuck with Atlanta. Giving more credence to
this is the fact that a Twins scout spent all of last weekend
checking out Braves games.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland teammates appear to be growing a bit weary of  &UR; David
Justice's minor injuries. Justice has gone into Manager  &UR; Mike
 &UR; Hargrove's office moments before games and asked out of the lineup.
Justice, who is signed through 2002, has three home runs and eight
RBIs. He has played left field in 27 of the 188 games since the
start of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Former World Series hero and rumored Diamondbacks expansion pick
draftee  &UR; Craig Counsell is being shopped by the Florida Marlins. He
has been completely buried by the Marlins, who are committed to
starting  &UR; Luis Castillo at second base.
</P>
<P>
   In what is probably a precursor to a move in 2000, San Francisco
called up  &UR; Dave Righetti to assume the role of pitching coach when
 &UR; Ron Perranoski was forced to leave the club to attend to his
ailing mother. Several people within the organization are very high
on Righetti.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's Gold Glove shortstop,  &UR; Omar Vizquel, is nursing a
pulled quadriceps that he hurt on April 10. The club refuses to
place him on the disabled list, even though his uncharacteristic
six errors (one more than all of last year) have been directly
related to the injury.
</P>
<P>
   Expect Chicago Cubs Manager  &UR; Jim Riggleman to be a part of
 &UR; Bruce Bochy's All-Star Game coaching staff. Bochy, a member of
Riggleman's staff when he managed in San Diego, wound up replacing
Riggleman. The two remain close friends. &QL; 
THE RANKINGS &QL; 
 &UR; TOP OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
1. Cleveland &QL; 28-5 in games delayed by rain since
the start of 1996. &QL; 
 &QL; 
2. NY Yankees &QL; The record is not an indication of several problems
on this club. &QL; 
 &QL; 
3. Atlanta &QL; Does not appear to missing  &UR; Andres Galarraga's bat at
all. &QL; 
 &QL; 
4. NY Mets &QL; Have the best bullpen in the game, which tends to lead
to contending. &QL; 
 &QL; 
5. Houston &QL; Astros are talking about moving  &UR; Scott Elarton into the
rotation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
6. Los Angeles &QL; Dodgers are only 3-3 in games  &UR; Kevin Brown starts. &QL; 
 &QL; 
7. St. Louis &QL;  &UR; Fernando Tatis is looking mahvelous. Simply
mahvelous. &QL; 
 &QL; 
8. San Francisco &QL; Barely clinging to first place as the weekend
series started. &QL; 
 &QL; 
9. Texas &QL; May miss President  &UR; Tom Schieffer more than they want to
lead on. &QL; 
 &UR; BOTTOM OF THE ORDER &QL; 
 &QL; 
30. Florida &QL; Had two smallest home crowds ever last
week. &QL; 
 &QL; 
29. Montreal &QL; Does anyone really follow this club? Even in
Quebec? &QL; 
 &QL; 
28. Minnesota &QL; Wake us when all this stadium garbage finally gets
resolved. &QL; 
 &QL; 
27. Baltimore &QL; A little winning streak is a start, but problems
persist here. &QL; 
 &QL; 
26. Kansas City &QL; Royals are hoping pitcher  &UR; Jose Rosado only misses
one start. &QL; 
 &QL; 
25. San Diego &QL; Will the Padres go from first to worst to first to
worst? &QL; 
 &QL; 
24. Cincinnati &QL; Has won two in a row three times, but never three
in a row. &QL; 
 &QL; 
23. Boston &QL; That 6-1 start seems like it took place years ago. &QL; 
 &QL; 
22. Anaheim &QL;  &UR; Tim Belcher has not survived the fifth inning in five
of six starts. &QL; 
ON THE RISE &QL; 
 &UR; Oakland Athletics: Manager  &UR; Art Howe has these young A's playing
like they're ready to make a nuisance of themselves in the AL West,
a division where they were supposed to clearly be the underbelly.
But a little more than a month into the season, Oakland is looking
the part of a club with some interesting parts. Offensively, this
club can stack up with the best of them in the AL. The middle of
the lineup, which features  &UR; Jason Giambi,  &UR; Matt Stairs and
surprising  &UR; Olmedo Saenz, is more than respectable. Shortstop
 &UR; Miguel Tejada is showing the ability that led many in the
organization to compare him to a young
 &UR; Barry Larkin, and it may not be long until minor league pitching
sensation  &UR; Mark Mulder arrives in the Bay area. This is one of the
hottest clubs in baseball. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL; 
 &UR; Toronto Blue Jays: The Blue Jays lost at home last Tuesday, their
first loss at SkyDome in 10 games. They then lost again Wednesday
and Thursday, being swept by Oakland. All the good feelings that
were with this club in the middle of April seem to be disappearing.
Injured starter  &UR; Joey Hamilton is not expected to return before May
20, and the offense, which produced big scores during the past two
weeks, is getting little help from a pitching staff that is having
trouble keeping opponents under 10 runs. &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
Cincinnati, ahem, outfielder  &UR; Dmitri Young crashed into the
outfield wall at Turner Field last weekend while chasing a deep fly
hit by Atlanta's  &UR; John Smoltz. Young missed the next four games
because of soreness in his left side. Young said after that
particular game: ``I fought the wall and the wall won. Tomorrow,
I'm going to the &UR; Andruw Jones School of Wall-Climbing.'' &QL; 
OUT OF LEFT FIELD &QL; 
Texas Rangers reliever  &UR; Jeff Zimmerman can put to rest any tags
about being a castoff from the independent Northern League, the
same place that produced Atlanta's  &UR; Kerry Ligtenberg. Zimmerman
entered the weekend series at Toronto with a 0.93 ERA in 19
innings. In 10 games he has walked two and struck out 14. Texas
Manager  &UR; Johnny Oates is calling on Zimmerman in the toughest of
situations. Opponents are batting only .109 against the
hard-throwing right-hander, a figure that drops to .091 when
runners are on base. Not bad for a kid who was trying to latch on
to whatever Northern League club would take a look at him two years
ago. &QL;

ZAGAT INVITES WEB SURFERS IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHELLEY BELZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Zagat Survey went online Tuesday at www.zagat.com with every
morsel of information that appears in the restaurant guide series,
and more, all of it free for now. Users can electronically rate
restaurants anywhere, whether Zagat has a guide to that locale or
not. The site is also looking for input on a Diners' Bill of
Rights, which will cover subjects like service and tipping, to give
restaurateurs something to chew on.
</P>
<P>
   In design, the site resembles the Zagat CD-ROM. Restaurants in
cities across the country, plus Toronto, Paris and London, can be
found by category (like cuisine, neighborhood, view), with their
ratings from the Zagat guide for food, decor, service and cost.
Clicking on the top of any column will reorder the list. Click on
``F'' (for food), and the restaurants will appear from most to
least delectable in the opinion of diners. All this works quickly
and easily.
</P>
<P>
   An oddity of the site, however, is that you might find the area
a restaurant is in (like Greenwich Village or Soho for New York),
but not one iota more of information. For the address or anything
more, you have to click on the restaurant name, which brings up a
log-in screen to register, an increasingly common practice on the
Net, unfortunately.
</P>
<P>
   The registration, Tim and Nina Zagat explained by telephone last
week, is for a future club or membership. The site states that
membership is free until Sept. 1 (and may be continued beyond
then), that there is no commitment, and no credit card information
is required.
</P>
<P>
   Registering does require giving name, address, phone number,
e-mail address and a little too-personal information, like place of
birth or mother's maiden name that no impostor would know and that
you might not feel comfortable divulging, considering how it can be
used. (Occupation and income are optional.) Registering makes sense
if you are going to shop by credit card on the site (members get a
25 percent discount on Zagat guides and products like sweatshirts),
or if you are going to vote for a restaurant (to eliminate the risk
of ballot-box stuffing).
</P>
<P>
   But you must register to get what you would from a printed Zagat
guide, like the address of that clicked-on restaurant and a review
of it, as well as a little more: a map and driving directions to
it. The maps are only for U.S. cities. In cases like New York,
driving directions might not be what the prospective diner needs
most.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic Produce
</P>
<P>
   Fanciers of exotic fruits, vegetables and seasonings will be
glad to know that Frieda's, the country's leading specialty produce
distributor, based in Los Alamitos, Calif., is on line, at
www.friedas.com. The company was founded in 1962 by Frieda Caplan,
who first made her mark on America's food tastes by persuading
stores to sell fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones. Another coup
was renaming the Chinese gooseberry to create a world kiwi
industry.
</P>
<P>
   For retail customers, Frieda's has a collection of baskets
(click on Frieda's by Mail). An exotic fruit basket includes the
signature kiwis, Asian pears, horned melons, tamarillos and
cherimoyas (five pounds, $72; eight pounds, $87). A basket of
seasonings popular with cooks includes elephant garlic, dried hot
chilies, dried exotic mushrooms and shallots (eight pounds, $57).
The site also has photos and explanations of exotic fruits and
vegetables, along with dozens of recipes detailing what to do with
a tamarillo or a cherimoya.
</P>
<P>
   Orders by e-mail or by calling (800) 241-1771.
</P>
<P>
   Gourmet Books at Discount  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers for cookbooks on the Internet might want to add Gourmet
Guides (www.gourmetguides.com), a mom and daughter business in
Seattle, to their list. Jean Bullock began the business in the
early 1970s, but these days Sarah Bullock does most of the work.
All the books are new, including out-of-print remainders, and are
usually sold, Sarah Bullock writes by e-mail, at a discount of 50
percent or more. Through the Net, they have customers in Japan,
Israel, Turkey and Peru.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to stock unusual titles that the big chains aren't
interested in but many foodies and cookbook lovers are,'' she adds.
These include ``The Khwan Niamut,'' a facsimile of a 1939 cookbook
with recipes for royal Persian feasts at home ($11), and the
``Prairie Avenue Cookbook'' by Carol Callahan, recipes and
recollections from 19th-century Chicago families ($11).

PROM QUEENS, EVIDENTLY, GO FOR THE SCHOLARLY TYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wrapped like candy in a sure-fire come-on of bouncing bosoms and
firm young female bodies, ``Trippin''' is a sermon aimed primarily
at teen-age black male high school students.
</P>
<P>
   The message: Get real. Get a diploma. Try to go to college.
</P>
<P>
   And the payoff for this effort?
</P>
<P>
   Why, you get to have all the sex you want with the prom queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trippin''' is a juvenile comedy with its heart in the right
place and its airy head incapable of applying logic to its script.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by David Raynr and written by Gary Hardwick,
``Trippin''' tells the story of Greg Reed (Deon Richmond), a high
school senior who gives the film its title by spending most of his
time daydreaming, particularly about sex.
</P>
<P>
   For those who focus unwaveringly on this latter-day clone of
Walter Mitty, the point of ``Trippin''' is clear. Education is
essential to success. But ``Trippin','' pandering to audience and
auditors, lacks the courage to pursue its logic to the bleak
underside of its sermon. So Greg's two worthless best friends, who
never crack a book, are rewarded, too.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the film, Greg's family, which includes his
hard-working father, mother, younger brother and grandfather, are
concerned that he shows little inclination to buckle down to his
studies and face life.
</P>
<P>
   But Greg, who loafs his way through an after-school job in a
local rib joint, is more concerned with the impending senior prom
and the seemingly unattainable Cinny Hawkins (Maia Campbell), who
just happens to be the most intelligent, most beautiful girl in the
school _ and, what's more, already has a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   One of Greg's best friends is June (Donald Adeosun Faison), who
spends part of his time inviting girls to the prom so he can bed
them first. He spends the other part so successfully in petty crime
that he is being scouted for the big-time by Kenyatta (Stoney
Jackson), a limo-riding alumnus of the high school and prison.
</P>
<P>
   The other pal is Fish (Guy Torry), who seems interested in
nothing besides his VCR and setting speed records for talk.
</P>
<P>
   It is only when Greg decides that the route to Cinny's body runs
through textbooks that he begins to apply himself to his studies
and the possibility of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is generally sunny, even when June's flirtation
with Kenyatta turns violent. The cast, including Michael Warren as
Shapic, a teacher who tries to talk sense to his students, is
appealing. But the message is mixed.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES
</P>

or adult guardian.) It involves coarse language, sexual fantasies
and foreplay and various types of violence.

ORGANIZERS PLAN A MADD-LIKE ASSAULT ON GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICKI HADDOCK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A nascent national organization is aiming to do
for gun control what Mothers Against Drunk Driving did for alcohol
policy: turn anguished victims into catalysts for change.
</P>
<P>
   The Bell Campaign is being created by some of the same people
who turned MADD into a national force, with hundreds of local
chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by a $4.3 million grant from the Goldman Fund, the
nonprofit group has been quietly organizing under the auspices of
the Trauma Foundation at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers plan to launch the Bell Campaign on May 25 with an
appeal for stricter gun control. The organization plans offices in
Atlanta, Honolulu, Laguna Hills, Calif., New York, San Francisco
and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   While the mass killings at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., have prompted the government to take a new look at the
availability of weapons, particularly to minors, organizations like
the National Rifle Association remain an omnipotent force rooted in
the constitutional right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The void has been that the only big grass-roots movement on
guns in this country is the NRA,'' said Andrew McGuire, executive
director of the Trauma Foundation and the creative force behind the
Bell Campaign. ``That is about to change _ and it's going to shake
up the whole debate about guns in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   McGuire has a lifetime of picking fights with formidable
Goliaths. Burned in an Oakland fire as a child, he campaigned for
fire-retardant children's pajamas, then emerged as a key advocate
for a motorcycle helmet law and an array of gun-control laws and
ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   He also was an acting executive director of MADD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, we will prevail,'' McGuire said, ``because in the
words of one victim, we love our children more than they love their
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Helsley, California liaison for the NRA, said gun-control
measures in California ``haven't done a thing to protect children.
They're certainly not any safer than the children of Vermont, which
has virtually no gun laws at all.
</P>
<P>
   Helsley predicted the Bell Campaign would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Campaign organizers recall the early days of MADD, when
drinking and driving was routinely excused and critics dismissed
MADD as a simplistic fly-by-night group of overwrought moms.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with nearly 4 million supporters in hundreds of chapters,
MADD has been instrumental in pushing for enacting tougher
penalties for drunken drivers, lowering the blood-alcohol limit,
raising the drinking age and transforming public attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people first underestimated about MADD, and now about the
Bell Campaign, is that we are driven,'' said Beckie Brown of New
Port Richey, Fla. ``An organization like this is made up of people
like me _ parents and loved ones who couldn't stop fighting to stop
senseless tragedy. We do it as a memorial to our slain loved
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of her son, Marc, to a drunken driver in 1979 led to
Brown's involvement in MADD, and she went on to become the
organization's national president. Another son, Michael, died of a
self-inflicted gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a board member of the Bell Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that she didn't know what if any changes in
public policy could have saved Michael. ``But that's the discussion
America needs to have. What will make the difference, what would
have saved my son's life, what would have saved those wonderful
kids in Littleton that my heart is so broken for?''

`AFTER LIFE': IN DEATH, A FOND REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)

<P>
   When we say we ``remember'' something, what exactly is it we
recall? A feeling? A smell? Words? Facial expressions? Invited to
relive an especially happy memory, how many of us would be able to
go beyond recalling how we felt, and describe the setting and
circumstances of that moment in precise detail? And even when we
conjure vivid mental pictures of past events, how accurate are they
really?
</P>
<P>
   These and other profound questions are the substance of Hirokazu
Kore-eda's brilliant, humorous, transcendently compassionate film,
``After Life,'' which opens Wednesday in New York City. The
Japanese director achieved international recognition four years ago
with ``Maborosi,'' an exquisitely photographed story of a young
woman coming to terms with her husband's unexplained suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Where that film found the very essence of sadness in the color,
light and shadow of Japanese landscapes and in images of a world
viewed from a distance through a screen of muted grief, ``After
Life'' is a movie of ideas whose visual surface is deliberately
mundane.
</P>
<P>
   Set in a large, drab office building, ``After Life'' follows a
week in the lives of a group of caseworkers, who at first appear to
be harried cogs in a social service agency, and their weekly load
of 22 new clients.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it is revealed that this particular agency is no ordinary
processing center but an agency that serves a special, extremely
serious purpose. It is nothing less than a metaphysical way station
whose clients are people of varying age and background who have
just died.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, they are assigned to caseworkers and told that they
have three days to choose a particular memory to take with them
into the next world. Once they have chosen, the staff will do its
best to make individual home movies of those memories for the
clients to take with them into eternity.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate question that ``After Life'' stimulates is
obvious: what memory would you choose? Would it be an erotic,
gustatory, artistic or drug-enhanced moment of rapture? Or
something more mundane like the memory of your head in mother's
lap? Or the exhilaration of a cool, clear summer morning?
</P>
<P>
   As the clients sort through their memories, ``After Life''
becomes a quiet, extraordinarily moving and sometimes funny
meditation on the meaning and value of life. It intimates that
whatever happiness we may find in life comes from within and is
self-created.
</P>
<P>
   There is a gentle, decrepit old woman whose fondest memory is
cherry blossoms. There is an aviator whose happiest moments were
spent flying through the clouds. The filming of his aeronautical
impressions involves the kind of ingenious low-budget fakery that
goes into the production of a grade school play.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a little girl whose happiest memory is a ride at
Disneyland. Told that 30 other children have chosen Disneyland
rides, she is gently coaxed into coming up with something more
original. And there is a defiant young man who refuses to make a
choice.
</P>
<P>
   The most complicated case involves Ichiro Watanabe (Taketoshi
Naito), 70, a man who glumly remembers his dull, conventional life
in an arranged marriage as unfulfilling. To jog his memory, his
caseworker, Takashi Mochizuki (Arata), plays back excerpts from a
file of year-by-year videotapes recording his life.
</P>
<P>
   It emerges that Ichiro's wife was also Takashi's fiancee, and
that the two men are the same age. Takashi died at age 20 in the
Philippines and has been working at the processing center since
then. He, like the other clerks, was unwilling to choose a memory
and must remain in limbo until he decides on one.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Life'' is as much a movie about filmmaking as it is
about memory. For what are movies, after all, but larger-than-life
dream images projected on celluloid? In its modest attitude about
the ability of movies to replicate dreams, ``After Life'' is the
opposite of bombastic Hollywood kitsch like ``What Dreams May
Come.''
</P>
<P>
   In capturing the essence of experience, it suggests, film is as
imperfect and quixotic as memory. When we sort through our
recollections to dredge bits and pieces of the past, the best we
can hope to come up with are the mental equivalents of crude old
videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   But if the movies can't fully capture the magical power of
dreams, making them is still a valuable, cathartic activity. And
when the time comes for the caseworkers and clients to make their
movies, ``After Life'' buzzes with the pleasurable excitement of an
artistic workshop.
</P>
<P>
   A striking aspect of ``After Life'' is its utter lack of
grandiosity. Visually the film doesn't try to ``poeticize'' any of
the memories with glossy travel brochure images or romantic music:
life and death may be serious matters, but they are also business
as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``After Life'' has its own austere beauty in beautifully
composed shots of silhouetted figures in bright doorways and other
images that subtly portray the office as a metaphysical portal.
</P>
<P>
   There are no heroes or villains, just caseworkers and quirky
clients working together to assemble clues to the past and in doing
so discovering meaning and value. What ends up mattering has little
to do with material success and accomplishment and everything do
with a having a sense of living in the moment, of belonging to the
world and feeling truly and fully alive.
</P>

IN THE BUSY, BUSY MONTH OF MAY...

<P>
   It's good that Mother's Day comes in May.
</P>
<P>
   In our house, it's a day for long-distance phone calls,
breakfast in bed and heartwarming cards. It's a day to catch your
breath before the May marathon.
</P>
<P>
   My mother-in-law, a retired teacher, warned me years ago about
May madness. She told me this time of year was busier than
December.
</P>
<P>
   But back then, I didn't appreciate the wisdom of her words. I
didn't know how many baseball games, field trips or work
assignments you could fit into one month.
</P>
<P>
   Now that I have children, I know better. Now, when I call my
mother-in-law on Mother's Day, our conversation always begins with
me explaining that her gift will be late because I haven't had time
to move it from the front seat of my car to the post office scale.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now that more is being offered to children and more
is being asked of parents, more women are in the work force. Today,
63 percent of mothers of small children and 78 percent of mothers
of school-age children work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, I left my elementary school with a Popsicle in
one hand and a report card in the other. My parents weren't asked
to attend any graduations until I walked several years later across
my high school dais.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, my daughter will spend her last week of sixth grade
showered with attention. There will be an awards ceremony, a DARE
graduation and a sixth-grade breakfast, all events I'm expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are optional events parents can go to, such as
field trips, spring concerts and, of course, ball games.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the time when the work load piles up at the office
because everyone's beginning to realize those projects still in the
to-do file need to get done before summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   It's also busier than usual because so many of us are arriving a
bit late or leaving a bit early to attend one of our many
family-related activities.
</P>
<P>
   This flurry of activity always makes me feel guilty and
grateful. Guilty because even if I doubled myself I couldn't
possibly attend all these activities, but also grateful for the
opportunities our schools provide.
</P>
<P>
   We need to recognize that at times like this it doesn't matter
if the house is messier than usual or the meals at McDonald's are
more frequent.
</P>
<P>
   We need to support our children and their schools as much as
possible. But we must put aside the guilt and recognize that while
the thanks we receive on Mother's Day comes only once a year, the
work we do as parents occurs over a lifetime.

BOEING TECHNICIANS HELP KEEP APACHE CHOPPERS FLYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Wearing U.S. Army fatigues and bunking down with
the troops, two Boeing Co. technicians are in northern Albania to
help maintain the 22 Apache attack helicopters poised for battle in
Kosovo, a company spokesman said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jensen, of Boeing's helicopter division in Mesa, Ariz., said
the two technicians are assisting Army mechanics at the Tirana,
Albania, who maintain the helicopters preparing for tank-killing
missions against Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army does all the actual work, and the technical reps are
there to give special advice, counsel or guidance _ whatever they
are needed to do,'' Jensen said, adding that the two technicians
live with the troops and don Army uniforms minus the Army insignia.
</P>
<P>
   If the Army dispatches additional Apaches to the region, more
Boeing personnel might be called in, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, rain and mud could pose problems for the
helicopters' mechanical systems, but Jensen said the company
technicians have not reported any serious maintenance woes thus
far.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing civilians in the war theater are an example of the
increasingly prominent role played by defense contractors in
advising the U.S. military on technical matters affecting complex
weapons systems.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1997 military exercise conducted at Fort Irwin Calif.,
designed to test new digital weaponry, 1,200 defense contractor
workers _ one for every five soldiers involved in the experiment _
were present to make sure everything worked as advertised.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1991 Gulf War, civilian workers for McDonnell Douglas
Corp. and Grumman Corp. were stationed aboard Navy carriers to help
maintain aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Also during the war, nine advisers from McDonnell Douglas _
which has since been purchased by Seattle-based Boeing _ helped
keep 274 Apaches flying missions. The company officials were called
on to advise the Army on how to remedy serious maintenance problems
caused by desert sand that clogged aircraft parts and weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The Apache is considered the most technically advanced
tank-killing helicopter in the world. The two-member crew can fire
16 tank-killing Hellfire missiles, 70mm rockets and a 30mm cannon
that can shoot 625 rounds per minute. The aircraft can hover just a
few feet off the ground, pop up and pounce on an enemy tank and fly
away at speeds approaching 200 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But the gunships have gotten off to an inauspicious start in the
Kosovo conflict. Two of the helicopters crashed and two crew
members have been killed since 24 of the choppers arrived at a base
in Albania near the Kosovo border. None of the sleek craft has been
sent into action and both crashes involved training missions.
</P>
<P>
   NATO commanders had to wait more than three weeks for the
Apaches _ designed to fight in bad weather and at night _ to arrive
from bases in Germany. The delay was partially attributed to the
Army's insistence that it have a force of 5,000 support troops to
protect and maintain the helicopters in Albania.

AWARDS FOR THE UNSUNG JOURNALIST
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Wednesday, May 12)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Journalism awards ceremonies tend to be rather dull affairs
because they recognize only good journalism, which represents only
a small part of what we do.
</P>
<P>
   I occasionally do a column on wacky headlines, headlines like
``Red Tape Holds Up Bridge'' or ``Crack in Toilet Leads to Arrest''
or ``Prostitutes Appeal to Pope.'' The sad truth is that I could do
a column of that sort three times a week for the rest of my life
and never run out of material, given the fevered,
near-hallucinatory imaginations of headline writers on deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Headlines like these can be quite clever, in their own
Alice-in-Wonderland way, yet you never hear of their writers
receiving any awards for their efforts. This is too bad, because I
feel certain that the general public would be much more interested
in following this competition than one in which a 12-part series on
sorghum subsidies goes up against a 25-part series on browser wars.
</P>
<P>
   Another journalism category that isn't considered for awards,
but should be, is the category of creative corrections, otherwise
known as the Oops! Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Time/CNN was a strong contender last year when it corrected
itself by saying the United States didn't really use nerve gas
against its own troops in Laos, though it's possible that somebody,
somewhere may have thought about it. Time/CNN could go up against
the Cincinnati Enquirer, which had to retract its 18-page special
supplement accusing Chiquita Banana of playing truth-or-dare with
Satan, or something like that. (Like most people, I didn't read the
original story; just the groveling retraction.)
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers do a lot of hand-wringing, yet there is no trophy or
plaque given to the paper that does it best. When the Starr Report
came out last year, editors somberly apologized to readers as if
they had mistakenly sprayed the pages with botulism toxin, then
proceeded to run the report in its 3-million-word entirety,
complete with explanatory editorials, columns and, if they could
get away with it, anatomically correct diagrams. Some readers,
unfortunately, didn't find the Starr Report to be all that big a
deal, causing some papers to run it twice.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings in Colorado, a certain paper with which I
have a passing familiarity asked readers if it was giving too much
coverage to ``copy-cat'' false alarms at local schools right
underneath a front-page story about ``copy-cat'' false alarms at
local schools. The strategy seemed to work: The majority of readers
said they had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the major omitted categories; there should also be
prizes for the things that constitute the day-to-day grind of
newspaper journalism. For example, an award might be given to the
writer of the Story That Made the Least Sense Because It Was
Chopped in Half to Make Space for a Promotional Advertisement.
There would be lots of nominees for this award, and it might need
to be shared by several people.
</P>
<P>
   Another award could be given to the writer of the Story That
Jumps to Nowhere, also known as The Parallel Universe Award. This
happens when a story is supposed to be continued on an inside page,
but for one reason or another, possibly solar flares or residual
shock waves from the Big Bang, isn't. Readers should be invited to
select the first-place winner based on how many minutes or hours
they flipped through the paper, looking for the continuation or
``jump'' of the story. (We in the newspaper business call it the
``jump'' because of the way readers jump out of their chairs and
hurl their paper to the floor when they can't find the promised
continuation.)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there should be an award for the writer of the Most
Misleading Headline, a category in which the competition would be
fierce if not positively lethal. I'm thinking in terms of a
headline like ``Woman Gives Birth to Septuplets'' above a story
having to do with the dangers of air bags or maybe a restaurant
review. Again, readers may want to judge this category,
particularly if they spent the greater part of a morning searching
for a story that had anything remotely to do with a woman, birth or
septuplets.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the awards ceremony from running on too long, there
will, unfortunately, be no categories for misspellings or
grammatical errors, unless they are committed by someone other than
me. Or possibly I.

CALIFORNIA QUIETLY APPROVES BENEFITS FOR UNMARRIED PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The California Legislature has quietly
granted health benefits to the unmarried partners of employees who
work in the Capitol and district offices across the state,
prompting Republican lawmakers to demand a hearing on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy allows Blue Shield health coverage, dental and
vision care to unmarried couples who live at the same address and
who are ``in a close and exclusive relationship in which each is
responsible for their common welfare,'' according to a memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   The City of San Francisco and many major California companies
already offer benefits to employees who have unmarried partners.
</P>
<P>
   And the Legislature is considering three bills that would allow
domestic partnership benefits at most private businesses, and among
tens of thousands of state, city and county employees. San
Francisco goes further than any of the bills by requiring companies
that contract with the city to provide domestic partner benefits to
their employees, although that ordinance is being challenged in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows how many of the Legislature's 2,000 employees would
want the new expanded benefits, but it would apply to any
homosexual or heterosexual couple. The Legislature would pay $170
to $340 to sign up the covered partner and any dependents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that puts us on a fair and competitive basis
with the private sector, and it's the right thing to do,'' said
Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, chairman of the Assembly
Rules Committee, whose members recently approved the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Rules Committee acts as a sort of board of directors and
personnel department for Capitol employees. At the direction of top
Democratic leaders, a memo was sent to all 12 members of the Senate
and Assembly rules committees asking them to vote on the matter by
checking ``aye'' or ``nay'' on the memo.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy was approved on a party-line vote and went into
effect immediately. There was little public notice of the policy
and no formal public hearing to discuss the matter, which miffed
Republicans on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-Uplands, demanded the Joint
Assembly-Senate Rules Committee hold a public hearing on the
matter, even though it appears to be a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central objection is a morality issue,'' Leonard said.
``This is discouraging family units by marriage and encouraging
other relationships ... Clearly it's a bad message that it sends,
an anti-family, anti-marriage message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a benefit that is not of a traditional nature,'' said
state Sen. John Lewis, R-Orange, a Senate Rules Committee member.
``It's one I don't think we should be asking taxpayers to
subsidize.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Legislature has been run by Democrats for several
decades, this was the first major effort to offer domestic
partnership benefits to Capitol employees. Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles, and Senate President pro tem John
Burton, D-San Francisco, support domestic partnership benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And Gov. Gray Davis had fought for domestic partnership benefits
while he was a University of California regent. Davis said he would
not sign a bill legalizing gay marriage, but would sign measures
expanding domestic partnership benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even for progressives, the issue of homosexuality still raises
concerns about what the reaction from the rest of the legislators
or the public will be,'' said Rand Martin, chief of staff to Sen.
John Vasconcellos, D-San Jose. ``Until recently, there haven't been
enough people like the Burtons of the world who say, `Reaction be
damned, it's the right thing to do.' The leadership had just not
been there.''

`CLOSE RANGE: WYOMING STORIES': LECHERY AND LONELINESS OUT WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, please note explicit language)  
(Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is any blood left in our romance with the West, Annie
Proulx (``Postcards,'' ``The Shipping News,'' ``Accordion Crimes'')
wrings it dry in her powerful new collection, ``Close Range:
Wyoming Stories.'' The people in these 11 fictions lead hard lives,
working livestock, raising sheep, riding the rodeo circuit, selling
trinkets to tourists, trying to wrest a living from the gritty
hardpan of their failing farms. No one is successful here except
the bar owners, the dude ranchers and the cattle traders, and they
are always just offstage, counting their money.
</P>
<P>
   Few here are ennobled by love; what drives Ms. Proulx's people
mainly is lust and lechery, itch and obsession. Ottaline Touhey,
the eldest daughter of the ranch family in ``The Bunchgrass Edge of
the World,'' is ``distinguished by a physique approaching the size
of a hundred-gallon propane tank.'' In conversation, ``a listener
would look back and forth between the pillowy, dimpled mouth and
crystal-crack blue eyes and think it a pity she was so big.''
Ottaline is so lonely that she hears her father's wreck of a John
Deere 4030 tractor talking to her _ ``Sweetheart, lady-girl'' _
begging her to restore it.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen Tinsley, in ``People in Hell Just Want a Drink of
Water,'' comes home to his family after five years of silent
absence. Left monstrously disfigured and speechless by an auto
accident, he takes to riding around neighboring farms and exposing
himself, until one outraged rancher fixes him with a dirty knife.
</P>
<P>
   What awaits most of the characters in these stories is the
hazards counted by Mrs. Freeze in ``Pair a Spurs,'' when she traces
a four-mile distance in her mind: ``Rattlesnake, gopher hole,
spooked horse, heatstroke, heart attack, lightning bolt.'' Or the
fate of Mero, the old ex-cowboy in ``The Half-Skinned Steer,'' who
drives across the country to his brother's funeral, only to get
lost and stuck in the snow and to look into a red eye of ``pure
teetotal hate'' pronouncing him ``done for.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should you read these stories, then, if their characters'
lives are so mean and their fates so inevitable? You read them for
their absolute authenticity, the sense they convey that you are
beyond fact or fiction in a world that could not be any other way.
And you read them for their language, not lyrical but a wry poetry
of loneliness and pain. After the castration of Ras Tinsley: ``The
morning light flooded the rim of the world, poured through the
window glass, colored the wall and floor, laid its yellow blanket
on the reeking bed, the kitchen table and the cups of cold coffee.
There was no cloud in the sky. Grasshoppers hit against the east
wall in their black and yellow thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the names of the characters evoke the stinted world of
these stories: Tick Corn, Como Bewd, Hondo Gunsch, Pake Bitts, Dirt
Sheets, Wauneta Hipsag, Dig Yant, Car Scrope, John Wrench, Hulse
Birch and, a sly joke, Dunny Scotus from Whipup, Texas, suggesting
Duns Scotus, the 13th-century Scottish theologian who disputed
Aquinas' harmony of faith and reason and whose name eventually gave
rise to the word dunce.

   Besides, you have little choice about reading the stories once
you've begun them. At the opening of ``The Mud Below,'' Diamond
Felts is mounted on a bull called Kisses, ``rank and salty, big as
a boxcar of coal.'' Will his long rodeo slump finally end? Will he
feel once again ``the dark lightning in his gut, a feeling of
blazing real existence''?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Governors of Wyoming,'' Wade Walls shows up at Shy
Hamp's ranch on a mission to fight ``these subsidized ranchers and
their gas-bag cows destroying public range, riparian habitat,
wiping out rare plants, trampling stream banks, creating
ozone-destroying methane gas, ruining the National Forests that
belong to the people, to all of us, stinking, polluting, stupid,
world-destroying cows ...'' When he spoke, ``his stiff face jerked
as though moved with hooks and wires.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start of ``Brokeback Mountain,'' the volume's strongest
story, Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist, two ``high school dropout
country boys with no prospects,'' find themselves passionately
attracted to each other sexually one summer while looking after
sheep on Brokeback Mountain. But they know that in Wyoming ``them
guys you see around sometimes'' have had their heads beaten in with
tire irons. So they try marrying women and living normal lives, and
seeing each other only on annual so-called fishing trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years on years they worked their way through the high meadows
and mountain drainages, horse-packing into the Big Horns, Medicine
Bows, south end of the Gallatins, Absarokas, Granites, Owl Creeks,
the Bridger-Teton Range, the Freezeouts and the Shirleys, Ferrises
and the Rattlesnakes, Salt River Range, into the Wind Rivers over
and over again, the Sierra Madres, Gros Ventres, the Washakies,
Laramies, but never returning to Brokeback.'' Two cowboys making
love.
</P>
<P>
   As the narrator of ``A Lonely Coast'' says, ``Wyos are touchers,
hotblooded and quick, and physically yearning.''
</P>
<P>
   A lonely coast. If you've ever been there, ``you've seen how the
shore rock drops off into the black water and how the light on the
point is final. Beyond are the old rollers coming in for millions
of years. It is like that'' in Wyoming ``at night but instead of
the rollers it's wind. But the water was here once. You think about
the sea that covered this place hundreds of millions of years ago,
the slow evaporation, mud turned to stone. There's nothing calm in
those thoughts. It isn't finished, it can still tear apart. Nothing
is finished. You take your chances.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Proulx's bleak but expressive stories, the stone turns
back to mud again. People take their chances and lose.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ She may or may not become a great artist,
but Ji Hyun-eun has the makings of a great photocopier.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Ji spends four hours a day, six days a week, in
after-school art classes, as do most Korean high school students
who aspire to become artists. And the centerpiece of those classes
is copying: the laborious sketching of the same classical
sculptures, over and over, until she can sketch them in her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth year that Miss Ji has been doing this in her
after-school hours, and she seems only slightly frustrated that she
has spent her time copying other people's works rather than
producing her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like creativity, but to be creative I have to do this
first,'' she said as she sketched a classical bust, surrounded by
other art students doing exactly the same thing. ``If I can sketch
this well, then I can do well in my entrance exams and then I can
get into art school and become an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has an ancient and dazzling artistic tradition, and
it would be difficult to find a society that treats art more
respectfully, but these days there is a growing sense in South
Korea that the system of nurturing young artists is
catastrophically flawed. The problem is that many art departments
admit students largely based on their ability to copy classical
busts, so that is what artistically inclined children spend years
learning to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrible,'' Kim Heung-sou, one of Korea's greatest modern
artists, said of the education system for training artists. ``It's
copying. It's not art.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to be a good artist, you must draw what you
like,'' said Kim, whose work hangs in museums around the world
under his pen name, Kimsou. ``You need creative work.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, 80, says the education system is stunting not just art but
the economy as well. When South Korea was hit in the fall of 1997
by the Asian economic crisis, he and many other Asians decided that
an underlying reason was that society was too regimented and not
creative enough. Kim reasons that as long as countries like South
Korea are simply expert at manufacturing other people's products,
they will always risk losing production to countries with lower
wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I decided we needed more creativity in society, and we
needed to bring it in with the children,'' Kim said as he relaxed
on a couch in an apartment overflowing with books and magnificent
canvases. Kim started his own program to train artists, choosing 80
elementary school pupils from 3,000 who applied. He meets with them
weekly for three hours and has them draw what they want so long as
it has some meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' he said, clutching a childlike sketch. ``This
is by a 6-year-old girl! This part is her dream of getting married
some day, so she is in a wedding dress, and this is her groom.
Isn't it wonderful!''
</P>
<P>
   The search for ways to inject creativity into education is
evident elsewhere in East Asia, from Japan to Taiwan to China, and
the issue is particularly relevant in the arts, which are supposed
to be society's creative frontier. Young artists in the region have
traditionally learned their trade by meticulously copying the work
of their teachers for years or decades. Respect for the teacher was
so great that it might have been seen as disrespectful to draw
things differently.
</P>
<P>
   The seriousness with which art is taken in South Korea is
evident on Picasso Street, as the street with the art schools is
nicknamed. It has scores of art institutes and art supply stores.
In Korea there are eight applicants for every place in a university
art program, and an applicant has almost no chance of being
admitted without a few years of study every evening in a private
art institute.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that South Korea is one of the few countries where
ordinary artists drive sports cars and dine in the flashiest French
restaurants. The artists get rich not selling their work but
tutoring high school students who want to get into university art
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Picasso Street may have plenty of art, but it somehow lacks the
creative impulse that inspired Picasso. ``I often tell my students
that if Picasso, Dali or van Gogh took lessons here, using this old
method of sketching busts, they would not make it into art
university,'' said Chung Chung-sik, the 42-year-old owner of the
Dae Sang Art Institute on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the critics acknowledge that the system has some
advantages. Korean artists have outstanding technical skills, and
all that copying of classical statues gives students a foundation
of facial expressions and shading that serves them throughout their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Some Korean artists acknowledge that their own system
shortchanges creativity but argue that the American system has
precisely the opposite problem. American artists, some suggest, are
full of wild ideas but lack rigorous artistic skills, so they
produce works that are sometimes more creative than artistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about American art schools,'' Kim fretted. ``They
don't teach the foundation; they just do the ideas. So you get
post-modern art that is just like graffiti.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case Korean art schools are beginning to change the
admission process, and the ability to copy classical busts is
steadily becoming less important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the universities seem to feel great pressure to change,''
said Joung Ki-jun, owner of the Hwal Joo Ro Art Institute.
``Because, to be frank, the contradictions in the system are such
that art students here are not able to realize their full artistic
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Some artists are optimistic that the changes will breathe new
life into Korean art, grafting new creative outlets onto a system
that has brilliant technical training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korean art used to be very stuffy,'' said Chung, the institute
owner. ``But now all that is changing, and because of those changes
I think Korean art has a very bright future.''

   The New York Times News Service commends to your attention a
feature package with photos and graphics from  &UR; The Seattle
Post-Intelligencer &LR; . The stories will be filed on Wednesday for
immediate release or for weekend use.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LIFE AND DEATH IN IRAQ: A nation sagging under the weight of
sanctions &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Larry Johnson, foreign editor of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer,
accompanied by photographer Larry Johnson, recently spent two weeks
in Iraq to report on the effect U.N. sanctions have had on Iraq's
people, most notably its children.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and DeLong traveled with a delegation called Washington
Physicians for Social Responsibility. They returned with a
compelling story of how the fabric of family life has been torn as
children are forced to drop out of school and find work and how
thousands of malnourished children are dying every month because of
a lack of medicine and food.
</P>
<P>
   Also contributing to the package was Michael Paulson, the
Post-Intelligencer's Washington correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ (Baghdad) _ At Al Mansour Pediatric Hospital, malnourished
children lay on stained mattresses. The hospital is dark;
electrical power is cut periodically each day to conserve
resources. Moving from bed to bed, Dr. Tarig Al-Shujairi lists the
illnesses: typhoid fever, pneumonia, leukemia, tuberculosis,
cholera. A nurse runs by carrying a small bottle of oxygen. Nemya,
a blond 2-year-old with meningitis is unable to breathe through the
fluid clogging her bronchial tubes. Her father and mother stand at
the side of her bed while the nurse covers Nemya's face with the
small oxygen mask. It is too late. Nemya's chest heaves, her body
shakes, and she dies. Her mother pulls her scarf close about her
face and cries silently. Her father looks at a visitor and touches
his chest over his heart. A fifty-cent tube could have saved her
life, but the hospital has none. Impossible to obtain under the
sanctions, Al-Shujairi says. Such is life _ and death _ in Iraq
under the sanctions imposed by the United Nations in the wake of
the 1991 Gulf War. By Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-VIGNETTES (Undated) _ Star-dash anecdotes on daily life in
Baghdad: a visit to an orphanage, at a wedding, an evening at the
tea house on the banks of the Tigris River (smoking flavored
tobacco from a water pipe), visiting a mosque during prayers, and a
military preparedness and training session for members of the
ruling Baath Party, including women. By Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-FIXES (Washington) _ In Congress, the critics of sanctions
are pushing several pieces of legislation that would exempt food
and medicine from sanctions, or that would require congressional
approval and impose sunsets. From politicians to grass roots
activists, there are more and more calls to get rid of a program
that critics say does more harm to innocent people than achieves
its stated goals. With 1 picture. By Michael Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-SANCTIONS (Washington) _ Since the end of the Cold War, the
U.S. and the U.N. have increasingly resorted to embargoes and trade
restrictions as a way of attempting to force change in countries
whose policies they don't like. The breadth of sanctions is
staggering: 42 percent of the world's population now lives in
sanctioned countries. Now, sanctions are coming under assault by
the business community and from those who argue sanctions hurt
civilians, not political leaders. By Michael Paulson.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-DOCTORS (Undated) _ Capsules on the 22-member delegation to
Baghdad, which included doctors, a veteran, a peace activist, a
writer, an artist and a medical student.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-TRIP (Undated) _ An short explainer outlining the
circumstances of the trip, how it came about.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-TIMELINE (Undated) _ A timeline of key events in Iraq since
it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-FACTS (Undated) _ Quick facts on its people, geography,
government.

EATING WELL: DO-IT-YOURSELF AIRLINE MEALS

   (editors: recipes at end of article)

 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not so long ago, when I passed through the gate to board a Delta
dinner flight from New York to Atlanta, I spied a stack of filled
brown paper bags and assumed they contained leftover bagels from a
breakfast flight.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until it was too late that I learned those bags were
not discards but dinner. Because no sign or person had advised me
to pick one up, I flew the whole way on an empty stomach. Not that
I missed much, but at 30,000 feet you have no other options for
feeding yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called act of dining aboard an airplane, at least on
domestic flights, has sunk to such depths that airports are doing a
land-office business in carry-on food, and things should only get
busier with the summer flying season setting in.
</P>
<P>
   There are flights that promise to serve a meal but deliver only
pretzels or, at best, mystery meat laminated to a squishy roll;
there are lunchtime flights with nothing at all, as airlines
tighten their belts to save money on food service. (Why don't they
put that extra money into the space between the seats?)
</P>
<P>
   One friend jokes that the only way to get lunch while traveling
cross-country is to board between 11:05 and 11:07 and be over a
certain state at a certain time.
</P>
<P>
   Choices at the airport are generally better than those on the
plane _ particularly in the wake of the recall reported in February
of 78,000 burritos made for American Airlines by Culinary Foods of
Chicago, a subsidiary of Tyson Foods. They were found to be
contaminated with listeria.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even airport fare is not necessarily what you might
choose to eat if you were looking for something that tasted good
and was good for you.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, make something at home, preferably the night before
travel. Cooking the day of a flight is not what most people want to
fit into a harried day of departure.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few rules for what you take on board. The food
should be easily portable and easy to cut or in bite-size bits,
because of the shortage of elbow room. It should not be too
aromatic: that's not fair to fellow passengers (especially if
they're hungry).
</P>
<P>
   You don't need fancy cutlery; plastic disposables will do. Do
take plenty of napkins. And while flying is dehydrating, the
airlines are still generous with liquids.
</P>
<P>
   But stay away from the very salty foods like peanuts, pretzels
and pizza: the salt just adds to the dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   One way to make cooking for a trip relatively painless is to
make twice as much for dinner of a dish that would also make an
appropriate cold meal on the flight the next day. And it takes very
little additional time to cook extra.
</P>
<P>
   The leftover food will also have time to chill in the
refrigerator. Food can be kept at room temperature for as long as
two hours; if you wait longer than that to eat your on-board meal,
it should be packed with a re-usable chill pack in an insulated
soft-side bag.
</P>
<P>
   Use old plastic containers for carrying the food, preferably
some that you can toss out rather than pack for the return flight.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes suggested here were chosen because they taste as
good the second day as the first and can be prepared quickly. The
pork and potato-arugula salad is ready in 20 minutes; the tuna
salad sandwich in 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, certain leftover cooked vegetables are delicious
chilled: steamed asparagus, broccoli florets, green beans, boiled
potatoes. They are especially good with a dipping sauce like salsa.
Cherry tomatoes on the stem are also perfect finger food.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit is a good choice because it is a hydrating low-calorie
snack that requires no cutlery; any apple you bring from home will
taste better than what the flight attendant hands out. Pick
whatever is in season and will not squash easily like berries.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the selection, keep it light. But if all else fails, a
2-ounce tin of caviar, a hard-cooked egg and some toast rounds
would hold most people, at least during meal service.
</P>
<P>
   BARBECUED PORK
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons coarsely grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons reduced-sodium soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 pound pork tenderloin, washed and trimmed
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil pan spray.
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine ginger, vinegar and soy sauce. Cut pork into 3
pieces, making the thin end longer than the middle and the other
end. Coat with ginger mixture and allow to marinate for 15 minutes
or overnight if you like (refrigerated).
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat a broiler or stovetop grill. Cover the broiler pan
with a double thickness of aluminum foil and spray with pan spray.
</P>
<P>
   3. Broil or grill the meat, turning once, until slightly pink at
the center. Allow about 10 minutes for the thin tail end and about
15 minutes for the rest. Watch carefully: it goes from pink to
overdone in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   4. Thinly slice and serve half the pork for dinner and
refrigerate the remaining portion in a a couple of layers of
aluminum foil. Place in a small insulated bag for the flight. Serve
with potato arugula salad.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   POTATO AND ARUGULA SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds tiny new potatoes
</P>
<P>
   1\ bunches arugula
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1. Scrub potatoes but do not peel. Cook in water to cover in
covered pot for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on size. Drain and cut
in halves or quarters, depending on size.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thoroughly wash arugula under running water and cut off tough
stems. Drain and dry; break into bite-size pieces.
</P>
<P>
   3. Whisk together oil, vinegar and mustard in a bowl large
enough to hold all the ingredients in the recipe. Add potatoes and
arugula, toss and season with pepper. Serve half for dinner and
place the remaining half in a small plastic container with a
tight-fitting cover. Refrigerate. Place in small insulated bag for
the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Note: You can also make a main dish of this by adding cooked
chicken strips or chunks. If cooking for one, halve the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   TUNA SALAD SANDWICH
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 6- or 7-ounce can water-packed tuna, drained and rinsed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon reduced-fat mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon bottled salsa
</P>
<P>
   { roasted red pepper, minced
</P>
<P>
   Cherry tomatoes, washed and dried
</P>
<P>
   4 thick slices whole wheat or multi-grain bread.
</P>
<P>
   1. Place tuna, mayonnaise and salsa in a food processor and
process almost to a paste.
</P>
<P>
   2. Stir in the red pepper and spread half the mixture on each of
two slices of bread. Top with remaining bread and cut in halves or
quarters. Wrap tightly in aluminum foil and refrigerate. Carry to
plane in an insulated bag with cherry tomatoes or other raw
vegetables like baby carrots.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings.

   A record 2.4 inches of snow fell at Williston, N.D., on Monday
as a cold upper-level low pressure system drifted overhead.
Wednesday, the cold, lofty low will stall over Saskatchewan,
Canada. In turn, an associated front at the surface will stall over
the upper Middle West, setting the stage for broken areas of rain,
some accented by thunder. Moderately heavy rain is possible over
portions of the upper Mississippi Valley and western Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will develop from the Gulf
states to the middle Mississippi Valley as moist air streaming
inland from the Gulf of Mexico is lifted by an upper-level trough
of low pressure arriving from the Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated, potent thunderstorms will erupt across parts of west
Texas as humid winds from the southeast gliding up the westward
sloping terrain are further lifted by a jet stream disturbance. A
few storms could become severe. In the Southeast, showers and
thunderstorms will sprout across eastern sections of the Carolinas
and Georgia as an upper-level low pressure system stalled off the
coast destabilizes the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hit-or-miss thunderstorms will bubble up over inland
areas of the Southeast. In Florida, isolated thunderstorms will
form in conjunction with sea-breeze fronts moving inland from the
Gulf and Atlantic coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Widely separated, gusty thunderstorms will flare Wednesday
afternoon near the Mason-Dixon Line as a cool front arrives from
the north at a time of maximum afternoon heating and greatest
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Changing Sites
</P>
<P>
   The place with the longest continuous weather records in
California, which date back to 1849, has been moved to a new
location, in the Sacramento area. The sensors have been moved
several times during the last 150 years, but this is the first
change since 1933. The new location for the thermometer and
rainfall data was chosen with great care, since sites with reliable
long-term weather records are very important in studies of climate
change. In particular, the Sacramento data will be used to study
the effects of urbanization on climate since the city has grown
substantially since 1933. &QL;

<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ An enormous and smelly flower has begun to
bloom here at Marie Selby Botanical Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is a Titan arum, which officials at Selby Gardens
describe as a ``bizarre behemoth of the plant world.'' A second
Titan Arum at Selby is also expected to bloom this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Horticulturalists say there is no way to predict when this rare
event might occur again. Selby has gone so far as to set up a
telephone hotline at (941) 366-2815 to give daily updates as the
blooms unfurl.
</P>
<P>
   So rare is this massive flowering that it has occurred only
seven times this century in the United States. Blooms can reach
heights of 7 feet or more. The crimson flower emits an odor of epic
proportions, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smells really bad _ like dead meat,'' said George Weich,
Selby's director of horticulture, ``but only when it's in full
flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the plant blooms so infrequently, the titan's intense
smell is needed to ``carry some distance'' to attract pollinator
beetles, Weich said.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is found in the rain forests of Indonesia. Selby
acquired seeds seven years ago from a horticulturalist who visited
Sumatra. Each year, the titan, or Amorphophallus titanum, sends up
a single leaf or a flower. Until now, the two plants have sent up
only leaves.
</P>
<P>
   This year is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until today, you couldn't tell what was going on,'' Weich
said Monday about the larger bloom. ``It just looked like a bullet
coming out of the ground. Now it's unfurling a little bit. It's
beginning to look like a flower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From here on,'' he added, ``it almost explodes.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the larger bloom was 36 1/2 inches tall and the
smaller was 24 inches. The blooms will grow at a rate of three to
four inches a day before reaching a peak of approximately 6 1/2
feet high by 3 feet wide. The full flowering lasts about 48 hours
before collapsing from its own weight.
</P>
<P>
   Selby plans to cross-pollinate the plants. If successful it
would be a botanical first, since a titan has never yielded seeds
in cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no particular season for it,'' Weich said of the
blooming. ``You just never know. It has its own timetable, but we
don't know what that is.''

HOMER MEETS DR. HAWKING  
 CALLING DR. GEIGER 
ARNETT'S NEW JOB
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Homer Simpson, the dunderheaded father on ``The Simpsons,'' is
renowned for his stupidity. Stephen Hawking, the Cambridge
University physicist, is renowned for his brains. On Sunday night
they met, fictionally speaking, when Hawking was a guest character
on the popular animated sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, who is nearly paralyzed and voiceless from the effects
of the degenerative muscular disorder known as Lou Gehrig's
disease, not only agreed to being written into the episode but
recorded his own lines as other voice-over guest stars do. His
``voice'' is expressed by a computerized synthesizer after he types
what he wants to say.
</P>
<P>
   In the episode, Lisa, the Simpsons' brainy daughter, joins the
Mensa Society, a club for geniuses; they overthrow the town
government and try to impose various improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``But of course they go too far,'' said Matt Selman, one of the
show's writers. ``We needed someone smarter than them, someone they
could respect who could shame them into seeing the error of their
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Another writer on the show, Larry Doyle, knew a relative of
Hawking and had been told that the famed physicist was a
``Simpsons'' fan.
</P>
<P>
   This is true. ``I think it's one of the cleverest shows on
television, and it always has a moral,'' Hawking said in a
statement he gave to Fox. He recorded his part last November while
on a visit to California.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scully, the show's executive producer, said, ``What I loved
was that it was a chance to have the world's smartest man and the
world's stupidest man get together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Hawking was a terrific sport,'' he said, ``even with jokes
that poked fun at himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Homer, being Homer, mistakes Hawking for another famous man in a
wheelchair. After Hawking scolds Lisa's gang, Homer says, ``Larry
Flynt is right, you guys stink!''
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Hawking tells the Mensa maniacs: ``I don't
know which is a bigger disappointment _ my failure to formulate a
workable unified field theory, or you.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the school principal tries to explain what Hawking is
``trying to say,'' Hawking interrupts him and says: ``Silence! I
don't need anyone to talk for me _ except this voice box.''
</P>
<P>
   The robotic sound of the voice box could come from any such
machine, and Selman said that he had read Internet chat among
``Simpsons'' fans suggesting the show's producers had faked it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was his computer you were hearing,'' Selman said. ``A
lot of the writers on the show are nerdy science guys anyway, and
we were in awe of him. He was unbelievably cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawking, according to the publicity statement, objected only to
his caricature. ``I'm not very flattered by my picture,'' he wrote,
``but it is fun.''
</P>

<P>
   Calling Dr. Geiger
</P>
<P>
   The wildly inventive mind of David E. Kelley was working
overtime as the television season drew to a close, not only because
he had to wrap up the seasons of ``The Practice'' on ABC and ``Ally
McBeal'' on Fox, but also because he stepped in at the last minute
to save his oldest surviving series, ``Chicago Hope'' on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley had ceased active participation in the production of that
medical drama several seasons ago, but when the series faced
imminent cancellation this spring, he went to CBS and offered his
services to try to regenerate interest in the show.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a series finale, to be shown in two weeks, in
which Kelley effectively returns the show to its roots. He brings
back Mandy Patinkin as Dr. Jeffrey Geiger, puts him in charge of
the hospital and has him fire almost every cast member who has been
added since Kelley left the show.
</P>
<P>
   Patinkin, who won an Emmy for his work on ``Chicago Hope''
before a desire to spend more time with his family in New York led
him to quit the series, is close to a deal that will bring him back
for seven of the 13 episodes CBS is expected to order.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley has agreed to write the opening episode of the season
next fall as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is in addition to his continuing work on both ``Ally'' and
``The Practice.'' Still another show, a new detective series for
ABC called ``Snoops,'' will also be under his production company,
though Kelley will not have day-to-day control over that one. He
did manage to write the pilot, and ABC executives are said to be
extremely enthusiastic about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice,'' meanwhile, ended the season with a stunner of
an episode that had several ABC executives calling it the best hour
of television they had seen all year. Kelley tied up several loose
ends from various cases, highlighted by a seasonlong decapitation
murder case for which he came up with an especially provocative
twist.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Kramer, the co-executive producer of both ``Ally' and
``The Practice'' said, ``I really feel like the fans were taken
care of in that episode.''
</P>
<P>
   As for whether Kelley had planned all season long to pull things
together in that way, Kramer said: ``I don't think David's mind
works that way, that far in advance. But who knows what goes on in
there?''

   Arnett's New Job
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks after his official departure from CNN, Peter
Arnett has found a new home for his international reporting, though
it's not on television.
</P>
<P>
   It is on the Internet. Arnett, who gained fame as CNN's reporter
on the spot during the air raids on Baghdad during the gulf war,
signed an agreement Tuesday with a newly launched Web site called
ForeignTV.com, which calls itself an Internet broadcaster
specializing in foreign news.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett has signed on to conduct a series of interviews with
world leaders for the service as well as to serve as an adviser to
the service in creating news bureaus in various locations.
</P>
<P>
   CNN settled Arnett's contract after effectively removing him
from the air in the wake of the scandal that became know as
Tailwind, after a report alleging that nerve gas was used by U.S.
military forces in Vietnam. The report by CNN was carried on its
news magazine program ``Newsstand.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnett was the correspondent for the report, which CNN
eventually retracted and apologized for showing.
</P>
<P>
   Arnett's agent, Richard Liebner, said that he was still seeking
a traditional broadcast news position for Arnett but that this
seemed an ideal way for him to re-establish some of his foreign
reporting credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seemed to me like something that will allow Peter to
travel,'' Liebner said, ``to keep up his contacts, and get him
cooking again.''

A MUSLIM SCARF SPARKS A DEBATE ON DEMOCRACY IN TURKEY

 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Sitting demurely behind her desk dressed in
immaculate white, Merve Kavakci does not look like someone who
could send a nation of 65 million into turmoil. But because of what
she wears, she has done exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Ms. Kavakci's chic white suit with gold buttons that
caused the problem. It is the white scarf that covers her head,
coupled with ideas of freedom she developed while living in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavakci was elected to Parliament last month, but when she
entered the parliamentary chamber in Ankara to take her oath of
office, pandemonium broke out. More than 100 legislators stood and
jeered, failing to break her composure but setting off a political
earthquake that is still shaking Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   In the end Ms. Kavakci, 30, left the chamber without taking her
oath. It was decided that the parliamentary chamber, considered the
cathedral of the secular republic, is no place for a woman with a
Muslim scarf.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, perhaps fearing that she would set off a near riot if
she ventured into a restaurant or cafe, Ms. Kavakci invited a guest
to her office at the headquarters of her religious-oriented
political party, Virtue, in an outlying section of Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting a reaction, but a democratic reaction,'' she
said of her memorable day in Parliament. ``I believe I had a right
to be there. I had been elected like the other 549 members. I am a
person like each of them. I campaigned like them, I eat like them,
I sleep like them. Because of my personal choice, I don't dress
like them. What they said was, `You are not like me so you can't
exist.'
</P>
<P>
   ``These were the same politicians who campaigned for more
democracy, who said they wanted democracy for everyone in this
country, freedom of speech, freedom of religion and blah blah blah.
If they really wanted democracy they would have supported me in
Parliament even if they didn't like the way I dress. But they have
a very elastic definition of democracy: democracy for me, but not
for you because you're different.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days since Ms. Kavakci burst onto the front pages,
secular politicians and commentators have been denouncing her as a
radical fundamentalist, a subversive bent on destroying Turkish
democracy, and an agent of Iran and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel called her an ``agent provocateur''
and said he had documents proving her ties to foreign powers. An
association that promotes women in Turkish politics condemned her
as ``a pawn in the hands of fanatical politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior prosecutor has announced that he is preparing a case
against Ms. Kavakci for ``fomenting hatred.'' Another prosecutor
said he would seek to ban her party on the grounds that it is ``a
vampire sucking the blood of the secular state.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Ms. Kavakci has received piles of
congratulatory messages from traditional Turks, many of them women,
who consider her an exciting new symbol of piety and political
defiance. There are more than a few cities in Turkey where she
could probably be elected mayor if elections were held now.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Ms. Kavakci and her party assert that their long-term
goal is to impose a radical form of religious rule that will
ultimately destroy freedom in Turkey. They consider her embrace of
the language of democracy deeply cynical and mendacious.
</P>
<P>
   Cigdem Kagitcibasi, a professor of social psychology at Koc
University in Istanbul, said the wearing of head scarves created
social pressure on women who did not wear them, and warned that
this pressure could ultimately lead to the imposition of
``religious terror'' in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every point in the development of society,'' Ms.
Kagitcibasi asserted, ``religion has been used as a cover to block
and roll back progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in front of a Turkish flag in her office, however, Ms.
Kavakci asserted that her goal was not to subvert democracy, but to
implant it in a country that does not yet fully enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   If there is still a stereotype that women who wear Muslim head
scarves are meek and submissive, Ms. Kavakci destroys it as soon as
she begins to speak. She is intensely focused and highly
articulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey has to sit down and decide whether we want to be a
democracy or not,'' she said, speaking in rapid-fire English. ``If
we want to be Communist or fascist, then I have no place here. But
in a democracy, my scarf would not be such a huge issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The roots of her militancy, Ms. Kavakci said, lie partly in
Turkey but also in the United States. After her mother quit her
post as a professor of German literature because of a conflict over
her head scarf, her father, a professor of Islamic law, decided to
start a new life. He became director of the Islamic Association of
North Texas, and moved to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kavakci stayed behind, but she too had trouble at school
because of the head scarf she began wearing when she was 17. After
visiting her family for a vacation, she shocked them by announcing
that she was going to stay. She entered the University of Texas at
Dallas, graduating in 1994 with a degree in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States I was accepted, not discriminated
against,'' she said. ``People in America smile at everything and
tolerate everything. They accept you even if you have a different
background or culture or religion. They take it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are different here. In our Parliament, if you think, if
you're smart, that's trouble. I am what I am, and they don't like
that.''

 &HT;    Charles Gibson tapes a segment on Texas barbecue
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The ``big hair'' mystery guest never showed up,
but about a hundred loud protesters did during the ``Good Morning
America'' telecast from the University of Texas campus on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview by Charles Gibson with Austin computer mogul
Michael Dell, a group protesting the delay in appointing an Asian
American studies program chairman revved up to fever pitch, nearly
drowning out the two men. The rowdy students continued to chant
during another interview with actors Brian Benben and Madeleine
Stowe, who live on a ranch near Fredericksburg.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began gathering on the South Mall at 3 a.m., and
despite weathering a wild thunderstorm, they were mostly cheerful.
A few happy onlookers carried signs welcoming the ABC morning show
and a couple of men carried signs asking Diane Sawyer to marry
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Morning America'' came to Austin for the first stop on
the program's ``Great American Gulf States Bus Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, executive producer Shelley Ross said
the Austin telecast would feature a ``mystery guest with big
hair,'' but that never materialized. An ABC publicist said a
shorter segment on Texas beauty shops that specialize in big hair
did air during a local news break, but nobody here saw it. No
mystery guest.
</P>
<P>
   Austinites who may have worried that the ABC program would make
us look like bumpkins breathed easily after the first few minutes,
when Gibson glowingly referred to the economic, political and
cultural influences of our fair area. We came off as smart and
sophisticated, not goofy.
</P>
<P>
   There were the expected features on barbecue (during which
Gibson donned a battered old cowboy hat and drooled over samples),
UT cheerleaders, an appearance by Bevo and his trusty Silver Spurs
and a performance by Shawn Colvin. There was one glaring error,
when Gibson referred to Walter Cronkite as one of UT's famous
grads. Uncle Walter attended but never graduated from UT.
</P>
<P>
   After greeting viewers, Sawyer sped off to the Governor's
Mansion, where she interviewed Gov. George W. Bush and his wife
Laura. Bush, who still claims he's not an official candidate for
president, was charming if evasive. Regarding renewed interest in
gun control in the wake of the Columbine High School massacre, Bush
said we should ``renew our efforts to be good moms and dads.''
</P>
<P>
   The highlight of the show was a tape of Sawyer's impromptu visit
to the Bowie High School prom, which took place Saturday night at
the Marriott, where the ``Good Morning America'' crew was staying.
Remember Elaine's awkward dancing on ``Seinfeld''? That pretty much
sums up Sawyer, and she must have known it. There were lots of
laughs as she made her way around the dance floor.

<P>
   KOSOVO-STRIKES _ WASHINGTON _ Forging a powerful union, Russia
and China called Tuesday for an immediate halt to NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia, in a move that threatened to scuttle U.S.
efforts to win United Nations support for sending military
peacekeepers to the embattled province of Kosovo. NATO dismissed
the pleas of Beijing and Moscow and forged ahead with an
intensifying and escalating air campaign that winds up its seventh
inconclusive week on Wednesday. (Deans, Cox News Service). 30.

Meanwhile, their counterparts in Macedonia appeared to meet with
some success as Kosovo refugees from crowded camps in Macedonia
began to move to a new camp near the southern Albanian town of
Korca. Developing. (Holmes, Cox News Service). 20. WITH PHOTO.

   MEDICARE _ The chairman of the failed Medicare reform commission
Tuesday lashed out at his fellow Democrats, charging that many of
them want a campaign issue more than real reform. ``There are
clearly those who don't want to do anything on this and use this as
a political issue,'' said Sen. John Breaux, D-La., who chaired the
recent Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. (Lipman,

awry, is being offered to private developers for $1 plus a federal
promise of $8.2 million for renovations . Over the last 30 years,
three landlords allowed it to deteriorate into a crime and rat

students to the back of the classroom. Her mom is poor, unemployed

around Dayton, Ohio three times in the last eight months. Only the
efforts of Dayton City Schools Head Start program kept the girl
from falling completely out of the system. But Amanda is one of the
lucky children, according to a report issued Monday by the
Children's Defense Fund in Ohio. The report, Helping Children
Learn, says 40 percent of Ohio newborns start life likely to live
in poverty and perform in the lower half of their class at school.

   FLA-WILDFIRES _ PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ Nearly four weeks after a

Franklin Street. Acres of pine- and palmetto-studded forests turned
to kindling as the blaze, whipped by 30-mph winds, blackened more
than 700 acres between Florida's Turnpike and Interstate 95 and
caused some $4.5 million in damages. Although at least 42 homes
were destroyed citywide, few streets were hit as hard as Franklin _
a once-bustling verdant corridor now flecked with barren cement
slabs, denuded forests and Dumpsters filled with broken bits of
lives. ``I've never seen Kosovo, but I can imagine what the place
looks like after this,'' said David Keirs, whose large home on
Franklin was one of nine spared. ``We built here because of the
lush trees and the wildlife. Now I hate to open the blinds in the

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes has been
taking his sweet time making a slew of major board appointments
he's had on the table since the end of the legislative session,
submitting his applicants to thorough background checks and trying
the patience of various interest groups, as he laps the state
signing all the laws he got passed. Given the general anticipation
this has created, it was a little curious that when Barnes
announced his appointments for eight of the 11 state Board of
Education seats, he did so by fax and not with a photo-op press
conference. No matter, though: With the governor moving education
to the top of his priority list for the next year, the board
members should have plenty of time under the lights. (Baxter,

   ISRAEL-SECURITY _ JERUSALEM _ Try as he might, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not been able to get any momentum
this election season behind his hardline stand on security and
confrontation against the Arabs. In a biting setback Tuesday, the
Israeli supreme court(CQ) squashed an order by Netanyahu to close
offices of the PLO in Jerusalem. Netanyahu's aides say the issue
had nothing to do with the elections or Netanyahu's slide in the
polls. But, he has allowed the office to function during his three
years in office until this week, when opponents said he was looking
to score points on his defense of Jerusalem. In 1996, a series of
suicide bombings were key in turning voters to the hard-line
Netanyahu. This year, there have been no major attacks. The prime
minister has resorted to showing video of the old bus bombings in
his campaign commercials. (Kaplow, Cox News Service). 20.

(Editors Note: In this package, the Chronicle profiles six rising
stars among Bay Area chefs. The package will move in three parts.
Profiles of three of the stars are included below. Each profile is
followed by a recipe from the chef. Also look for  STAR CHEFS2, 
profiles of the three other stars, and  STARS SIDE , which tells
where to find this year's stars and what became of previous stars.) &HT;     &HT;     HERE COME THE STARS: Young Bay Area Chefs on the Rise  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Who are the people who will make a splash in the
Bay Area in 2000 and beyond? The Food staff dusted off its crystal
ball and came up with half a dozen likely candidates.
 &HT;    Truth be told, we didn't really need any supernatural tools. We
were guided by our taste buds. The chefs highlighted here have
wowed us with their savory courses or their miraculous desserts and
pastries.
 &HT;    All of our chefs have one thing in common _ they take a classic
approach to food. You won't find wild cross-cultural cooking in any
of their repertoire. Five are grounded in classic French and one in
rustic Italian.
 &HT;    The future never tasted so good.

 PROFILES: HEATHER HO, SARAH LAMBERT, CRAIG STOLL  
   
   
 PROFILE: HEATHER HO  
 
 By Karola Saekel   
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
Majoring in hotel and food management at Boston University, Heather
Ho and her family expected that she would become a manager, an
executive. So when she so loved the program's food/cooking
component that she decided to become ``just a cook,'' the family
was nonplussed.
<P>
   They've gotten over the shock. After graduating from the
prestigious Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, N.Y., and
an internship at San Francisco's then-brand-new Aqua, where her
nascent love affair with pastry came into full bloom, the
Honolulu-born chef secured jobs at such prestigious Manhattan
restaurants as JoJo, Gramercy Tavern, Screening Room and
Clementine.
</P>
<P>
   When she was offered the position of pastry chef at Boulevard
last fall, she didn't think long before accepting. For one thing,
she says, ``I always wanted to come to San Francisco'' (where her
mother now lives). For another, her style and philosophy are in
perfect sync with Boulevard chef/owner Nancy Oakes. ``I've never
worked in a more congenial place,'' Ho says.
</P>
<P>
   She also finds Boulevard's clientele receptive to her style of
dessert-making. ``I like American classics,'' she says _ with a bit
of tweaking.
</P>
<P>
   That tweaking often takes the form of deconstructing a
traditional recipe, then reassembling it in a fresh way. Example:
that old standby, fruit crisp. Ho starts with a shortbread crust,
tops it with stewed fruit, then caps it with a separately baked
crumb topping. With this treatment, the bottom retains its
integrity, the fruit is cooked just to the right degree and the
topping is crisp and crunchy rather than soggy _ a drawback to most
standard crisps.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ho says, it's still a comfortingly familiar dessert.
</P>
<P>
   She has found that diners may be adventurous when choosing an
entree or appetizer, but they tread more traditional ground when it
comes to desserts. Strawberries will outrank mango or pineapple any
day of the week, she says. Anything with raspberries sells, and if
a pastry chef wants to play it really safe, nothing beats creme
brulee.
</P>
<P>
   The trick in creating successful restaurant desserts, Ho says,
is to come up with something that's familiar yet sports an element
of surprise. To make this work, Ho plays with intriguing shapes,
adds an herb or pairs fruit and/or pastry with an unusual ice cream
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant desserts should be neat and tidy and not too big _
``no doggie bags for dessert,'' she quips.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing her East and West Coast experiences, Ho says New
Yorkers have a penchant for chocolate and expect dressier desserts.
San Franciscans appreciate a more straightforward approach _ and
they know and love fruit: ``You don't have to explain what a quince
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho believes that a chef _ pastry or otherwise _ should balance
personal creativity and customer expectations. No matter how
imaginative a dish might be, if it scares diners it's a failure.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't found San Francisco diners overly conservative, but,
thankfully, they also aren't likely to make the kind of wacky
requests that sometimes confound New York chefs. ``No chocolate
sauce on tarte Tatin,'' she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE WITH CARAMELIZED BANANAS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Heather Ho &LR; , pastry chef at Boulevard, &LR;  offsets the intense
chocolate flavor of this cake with whipped cream, or vanilla or
caramel ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Cake &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cocoa
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup boiling water
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   11/3 cups light brown sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 egg + 1 egg white, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup pecans, toasted
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup + 2 tablespoons cake flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon baking powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon baking soda
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Caramel Pecan Topping &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon corn syrup
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons cream
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups pecans, toasted and finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Banana Topping &LR;
</P>
<P>
   4 or 5 firm-ripe bananas
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly grease and flour a 10-inch
springform pan.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the cake:  &LR; Whisk together the cocoa and boiling water
until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and let cool to room
temperature. Whisk in half of the buttermilk, mixing until smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the mayonnaise, brown sugar, egg, egg white and vanilla.
Beat with an electric mixer until very light and nearly doubled in
volume, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the pecans, the 2 flours, baking powder, baking soda and
the salt in a food processor and pulse until the mixture achieves a
powdery consistency. Add to the beaten egg mixture in thirds,
alternating with the remaining buttermilk. Fold in the chocolate
mixture until just combined.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake in the lower
third of the oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until a cake tester
inserted in the center comes out clean. Place on a rack and let
cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The cake may be made up to 8 hours in advance to this point.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the topping:  &LR; Combine the sugar, corn syrup and water
in a small, heavy-bottom saucepan. Place over medium heat and cook
until the mixture turns amber, washing down any sugar crystals
clinging to the sides of the pan using a pastry brush dipped in
water. Remove from heat and slowly add the cream. If lumps form,
return to heat briefly, stirring constantly, until smooth. Whisk in
the butter and fold in the pecans.
</P>
<P>
   The filling may be made up to 1 week in advance. Cover tightly
and keep refrigerated. Reheat in a double boiler or microwave until
quite warm (but not hot) and softened. Mixture will remain stiff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble:  &LR; Dot the top of the cake with the caramel, then
spread over the cake. This will be textured; do not expect a smooth
topping.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, preheat the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the bananas diagonally into thin slices, discarding ends.
Pat slices to flatten, then arrange on the cake in concentric
circles, starting from the perimeter. Try to cover the top as
completely as possible. Sprinkle with sugar and broil 3 to 5 inches
from the heat source, until the sugar melts and turns golden. Watch
carefully so it doesn't burn.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the rim of the springform; transfer the cake to a plate
and serve immediately, topped with whipped cream or ice cream if
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

 &UR; PROFILE: SARAH LAMBERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Kim Severson &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
Pastry chef Sarah Lambert walks into her Mill Valley patisserie by
3:30 a.m. six days a week. She heads home at 7 p.m., often so tired
she barely has energy to talk to her boyfriend or walk her two
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   She often spends hours searching for the right ingredients, like
organic rose petals, candy or perfect golden raspberries to top a
tart. And she gets personal with her customers _ during the wedding
season, she'll sit with three or four couples a week, patiently
helping them select their cakes.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, the bright young chef from New Jersey who owns the sleek
Patisserie Lambert finds herself with a heavy workload. Despite the
pressure, she's an incredibly nice person. At least, that's what
her staff of 10 will tell you. Lambert certainly won't. She's more
interested in discussing the finer points of patissiere, a culinary
territory she approaches with the intensity of a chemist and the
eye of an artist.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16 months Patisserie Lambert has been open, it has gained
the affections of Marin residents, picky French ex-patriots and San
Franciscans who appreciate her authentically French baked goods.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert's shop is functionally designed with contemporary black
snake lights, a processed cement floor with a copperlike patina and
stainless steel cases that contain some savory items, like
caramelized onion, bacon and Gorgonzola quiche. But her focus is
sweet French pastry.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, Lambert spent her spare time in the kitchen. She
prepped food in an Italian restaurant and learned the basics at
home from her grandfather and mother. She left the East Coast and
took up studies at the California Culinary Academy because
California seemed like the best place to learn about food. Although
she trained in every aspect of cooking, she kept drifting back to
the pastry kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert calls on her training in cooking and her delight in
dining out to inspire her pastry work. For example, a
saffron-perfumed chicken dish she ate out led to a honey-saffron
Bavarian mousse with sliced peaches.
</P>
<P>
   She brainstorms with head pastry chef Shawn Brennan, a former
chef at Charles Nob Hill in San Francisco who also uses flavors
found in entrees to enhance pastry, like a gingered white-pepper
shortbread.
</P>
<P>
   But twists on tradition aren't Lambert's trademark. Tradition
itself is. An apprenticeship under a German chef at the San
Francisco Hilton cemented her appreciation for the formal
constructs of European baking. Further training at Le Cordon Bleu
in Paris and work under master French pastry chefs at Le Cirque in
New York and La Folie in San Francisco sharpened her skills.
</P>
<P>
   Authenticity matters to Lambert. She often offers pate a choux
filled with hazelnut praline cream flavored with rum and vanilla.
The traditional but obscure French pastry is shaped like a bicycle
tire and called a ``Paris Brest,'' named after a bike race from
Paris to Brest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get a lot of French customers who ... say, `This is just
like home.'''
</P>
<P>
   American-born customers are fond of her perfect petit four
glace, almond tarts and Vahlrona truffles, which show up by the
dozen at parties in Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   Lambert strives to find the balance between pleasing customers
and producing pastries true to their origins. For example, she has
had to pull customers around to her way of thinking about cakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are surprised by the lack of sweetness. But my cakes
aren't as sweet. I don't want everything to taste of sugar.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambert's challenge remains running her shop, although at the
urging of some of her New Jersey investors, she is considering
expanding to the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, finding some time to relax is high on her list.

 &UR; PROFILE: CRAIG STOLL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Robin Davis &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of the menu at Delfina is a statement that reads,
``Don't be afraid of your food.'' Chef/owner Craig Stoll is so
passionate about the subject, he hates hearing people say a certain
food is good for you or bad for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop with the food allergy du jour,'' he says. ``People should
enjoy food, enjoy life. That's what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoll is nothing if not opinionated, especially when it comes to
cooking. The 34-year-old worked his way through a number of Bay
area restaurants before opening his wildly popular Mission district
restaurant last &UR;  &LR; November.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in San Francisco after earning degrees from the
Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and Florida
International University, he landed at Campton Place in San
Francisco. A self-described punk (``I would have fired me,'' he
says), Stoll says working with people like former Campton Place
chefs Bradley Ogden and Jan Birnbaum made him realize how little he
knew.
</P>
<P>
   He also gained experience in restaurants such as Hawthorne Lane
and Splendido but attributes much of his cooking style to a
six-month internship in Italy. He spent half the time in cooking
classes in Piedmont and the other working at a restaurant called Da
Delfina outside Florence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned what ingredients, what food could really taste
like,'' Stoll remembers. ``I learned about simplicity, purity and
directness of flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, his food at Delfina emphasizes seasonality.
``I try to focus on the flavors that are there instead of trying to
combine a lot of flavors,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The simple approach works. His spaghetti sauce is nothing more
than canned tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and basil, but the finished
dish is a revelation. Equally as good are his fluffy salt cod
brandade, roast chicken and flatiron steak next to a pile of crispy
fries.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, his restaurant is not Italian but is his take on
California cuisine or, as he says, ``what California cuisine should
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Stoll graciously credits his partner, Anne Spencer, with much of
Delfina's success. ``Annie is incredible with people,'' he
explains. ``When I met her, I met the front-of-the-house partner
I've always wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the restaurant include doubling the space by taking
over an antique shop next door and adding a wood-fired oven and an
outdoor patio. In terms of food, Stoll would like to continue to
expand his repertoire throughout each season.
</P>
<P>
   But despite some national attention, Stoll still considers
Delfina a neighborhood restaurant and says the people who come in
are the best customers he's ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love the menu and they're not afraid of the food,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes this rising star very happy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; DELFINA'S SPAGHETTI &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The secret to this simple and delicious recipe is partially
cooking the pasta in water then finishing the cooking in the pasta
sauce. This recipe yields enough sauce for 8 servings (it's easier
to make in a larger quantity). You will need only half of it for
this recipe. Ladle the remaining sauce into an airtight container
and freeze for another day. It freezes well for up to 2 months.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   2 (28-ounce) cans peeled whole tomatoes (such as Di Napoli)
</P>
<P>
   3 cups water
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Hot red pepper flakes to taste
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch fresh basil (leaves only), torn into small pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Heat the oil in a large heavy saucepan over medium-low heat.
Smash the garlic with the side of a chef's knife; sprinkle with
salt. Add to the oil. Cover and cook slowly until tender but not
browned, about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, remove the seeds from the tomatoes, breaking up
tomatoes slightly with your hands. Add the tomatoes and their
juices, along with the water to the saucepan. Increase heat to
medium-high. Season lightly with salt, pepper and chile flakes.
Bring to a boil. Skim the foam that rises to the top, being careful
not to skim the oil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for about
2 hours, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is reduced by about
two thirds and the oil is emulsified in the sauce. Remove from
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Pass two thirds of the sauce through a food mill fitted with the
medium blade. Stir this puree into the remaining sauce, then stir
in the basil.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water for 6
minutes. Drain, reserving 11/2 cups of the cooking water.
</P>
<P>
   Choose 2 large, heavy skillets. Place a generous 1/2 cup of the
sauce in each. Place over medium-high heat. Add 1/4 cup of the
reserved cooking water to each skillet. Divide the pasta between
the skillets. Cook, stirring frequently, until the pasta is cooked
through and sauce clings to the pasta, adding more cooking water if
necessary. Adjust seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Divide pasta among serving plates. Sprinkle with Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4, with leftover sauce.

EDITORS NOTE: This column profiles Northern California growers,
anglers and artisans who make the region such a culinary
wonderland. Over the next few months, we'll take you from field to
forest to factory to look at the wealth of ingredients stocking our
larders. As a bonus, Georgeanne Brennan will offer tips for using

 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 CALISTOGA, Calif. _  You would think that when it comes to salad
greens, one size fits all.
 &HT;    You would be wrong.
 &HT;    At Forni Brown Vegetables, a Calistoga grower of organic salad
greens, herbs, tomatoes and baby vegetables, such celebrated Napa
Valley chefs as Thomas Keller of French Laundry and Hiro Sone of
Terra get greens grown to the size they prefer. Keller reportedly
likes 1/4-inch leaves; Sone opts for a somewhat larger size.
 &HT;    As well as meeting size preferences, Forni Brown plants
requested crops, sometimes from seeds the chefs bring to them from
Europe or Asia. ``Hiro,'' says gardener Lynn Brown, ``has to have
his shiso.'' Other chefs may want a particular European green, a
certain kind of mint or such delicacies as blanched frisee _
created by placing an upside-down flower pot over the plant.
 &HT;    The week of May 2 saw the first '99 harvest of this tender salad
green. This, says Brown, is the time when the year's first
plantings reach perfection. At his nursery, a five-minute walk from
Calistoga's main drag, Brown and partners plant every week, 10
months a year, supplying virtually all the major local restaurants
and a few beyond the valley.
 &HT;    Forni Brown concentrates on its chef customers, occasionally
selling to the public at a few seasonal farmers markets and
supplying the Palisades Market, a small, upscale deli in Calistoga.
But Brown says the methods his company has developed over the past
18 years are equally applicable to home gardens.
 &HT;    Most greens, he says, grow well in Northern California. To fill
your salad bowl fresh from the garden most of the year, he suggests
putting out seed every 10 days to two weeks, planting only as much
as your household will consume in two weeks.
 &HT;    Forni Brown's 41/2 acres in Calistoga keep as many as 30
restaurants in greens. But just recently the partners _ Brown,
Peter Forni and Barney Welsh _ acquired 170 acres administered by
the Sonoma Land Trust in nearby Knights Valley. Some of the land is
forested, but the partners are formulating plans for growing a lot
of organic vegetables on the historic farm site (complete with a
120-year-old barn).
 &HT;    Gardener Brown is passionate about his crops. His voice
practically shudders when he talks of some mass-marketed so-called
mesclun salad mixes that contain cut-up large romaine and spinach
leaves, with ornamental kale thrown in for color (see Food in the
News elsewhere in this section). ``That stuff (the kale) is
virtually inedible,'' he says, adding that the only ingredient that
should be torn is radicchio.
 &HT;    He admits that the definition of mesclun is a little vague. Some
purists insist that it should be based on dandelion greens, but he
likes to define it as ``small _ fork-size _ greens at their best.''
 &HT;    Almost as important as growing and harvesting correctly is the
way greens are handled after they have been picked. Brown says to
mix the greens for mesclun _ he uses up to 14 varieties, including
some Asian greens _ in a large bowl of water. If you mix them dry,
you are going to bend some leaves, he cautions, ``and in a couple
hours, you'll have brown streaks.''
 &HT;    After washing and mixing, the greens need to be dried. At home,
salad spinners are fine, but if you are fixing salad for a crowd,
you might do what Forni Brown does: Place the greens in mesh bags
(the kind used for machine washing lingerie) and put them in the
washing machine's spin cycle _ no water, no heat. Just make sure
there are no residues of detergent or bleach in the machine.
 &HT;    Many chefs, of course, buy different greens separately, but the
convenience of the precleaned mix has a lot of adherents. Industry
estimates predict that in a few years these mixes will account for
25 percent of salad greens sold in the United States, Brown says.
 &HT;    Brown has favorites among the 30 or so greens his company grows:
tatsoi, also known as Chinese spinach, is equally good picked small
or large and, although related to bok choy, has no cabbage flavor.
His favorite mustard green is Chinese red mustard, with a flavor
like Dijon mustard.
 &HT;    But his all-time pick is Little Gem, also known by its French
name, sucrine. It's a semi-romaine developed in France about 150
years ago, ``long before Luther Burbank.'' It's the preferred
lettuce in England, he says, and for good reason: Its
romaine-shaped heads carry smooth, flat leaves that are succulent
and possess none of the leathery quality often found in true
romaine.
 &HT;    Brown thinks Little Gem is a good green for proselytizing:
``Even people who say they don't like salad, including kids, love
this stuff.''
 &HT;     
 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) 
 
 SOME GREENS NEED NO DRESSING  
 
When you make a salad with assertive greens, such as tatsoi,
frisee, radicchio, arugula, mache, chicory, lolla rossa or Chinese
red mustard, you don't need to pile on a lot of extra flavors with
dressings. &HT;    In fact, says Lynn Brown, one of the three partners in Forni
Brown Vegetables of Calistoga, you shouldn't. Brown cites Chinese
red mustard _ one of his favorites _ as an example. This mustard
green, he says, has a flavor that evokes Dijon mustard, so the
simplest of dressings is the best: salt and pepper, olive oil and a
dash of balsamic vinegar.
 &HT;    If the mustard leaves are more than 5 or 6 inches tall, they're
best used for wraps.
 &HT;    Tatsoi can substitute for spinach in a salad. In fact, Brown
points out, it is sometimes called Chinese spinach. He says in
addition to making a fine salad, these greens are sturdy enough to
go into a stir-fry.
 &HT;    The preferred salad green in the Brown family kitchen is
sucrine, also known as Little Gem, dressed with salt, pepper, olive
oil, vinegar and a generous grating of fresh Parmesan.
 &HT;    Arugula, says Brown, takes well to a slightly more elaborate
treatment _ salt, pepper, oil, vinegar, Gorgonzola and toasted
walnuts.
 &HT;    Although salad ingredients account for nearly 90 percent of
Forni Brown's business, the company also grows tomatoes, eggplant,
edible flowers and herbs, including perennial favorite rosemary.
 &HT;    Brown has a suggestion for cooks who think they don't like the
flavor of rosemary: Chances are you are using the wrong kind of
rosemary. If the plant produces dark purple blossoms, it's the
ornamental kind. The paler the blossom, the better the taste, Brown
says. ``Dark-flowering rosemary may look pretty, but it tastes
soapy.``

EDITORS NOTE: Food, nutrition and health studies bombard us, but
the seemingly endless information is often as confusing as it is

aims to change that. This regular round-up column will make
practical sense of the latest nutrition-related studies _ as well
as offering offbeat but tantalizing snippets of other food news to

 &HT;     By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; So how safe is that bag of pre-packaged salad in
the 'fridge?
<P>
   If you're relatively healthy, it's fine. But some government
researchers want to make ready-to-eat salad safer for the elderly,
some pregnant women and people with compromised immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposed &UR;  &LR; tool is irradiation, a process that shoots low
levels of ionized radiation through food to kill microbes and
retard spoilage. The controversial food treatment is being examined
largely as a way to reduce salmonella and other disease-causing
bacteria in beef and poultry, but some fruits and vegetables are
getting the rays.
</P>
<P>
   Although rare, irradiated strawberries, oranges, tomatoes and
mushrooms have appeared in some of the nation's produce bins.
Federal regulations require food treated with radiation be clearly
marked as such.
</P>
<P>
   Bags of ready-to-eat salad might one day be part of that mix.
Recent experiments at a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory
in Florida have shown that zapping packaged iceberg lettuce reduced
yeast and microbe populations significantly and only slightly
affected crispness. But how safe is too safe? That's the question
some food-science researchers and people in the $1.2 billion
bagged-salad industry are asking.
</P>
<P>
   Before it goes into oxygen-controlled bags, ready-to-eat lettuce
is washed in a chlorine solution and then in clean water. The
result is a product that has never been associated with a
food-borne illness, USDA officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That should be proof enough that a zap of radiation isn't
needed, says Larry Bell, vice president for science and technology
at Fresh Express, the pioneer in bagged salads, in Salinas, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Further, irradiating lettuce could actually make it less safe,
says Trevor Suslow, a post-harvest specialist at the University of
California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Irradiating food kills bad bacteria along with friendly
organisms that help keep it fresh, Suslow and Bell explain. The
process also extends shelf life, but by doing that disarms nature's
alarm: the spoilage process. Food that is rotted looks so
unappetizing that consumers don't buy _ or eat _ it, thus avoiding
potentially dangerous bacteria. But if the spoilage process is
interrupted, potentially unsafe pathogens can continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time food has produced a toxin or that toxin has grown
to a high-enough level to make you sick, the produce is already
rotted. Irradiation might change that,'' Suslow says.
</P>
<P>
   Makers of prepacked salads, along with organic farmers, are
looking at ways other than radiation to supplement the chlorine
wash process, which can be hard on workers and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Pumping rinse water full of ozone, an environmentally safe
process which kills organic material and then becomes oxygen, is
one option. And the Environmental Protection Agency recently
approved some new disinfectants based on safer, alternative forms
of chlorine and other compounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Suslow says, don't worry about your salad's
safety. ``I wouldn't do any extra washing. It's a very clean
product already.''

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Top Frozen Potsticker Comes From Trader Joe's   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  With all the convenience products in the freezer
case, making hors d'oeuvres for a party or an after-school snack
can be a breeze. Of course, it's no surprise that there are many
Asian offerings in this category like egg rolls and, more recently,
potstickers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted four different frozen potstickers, all with
vegetable fillings. Overall, the panel was disappointed with what's
in the market, saying that much better potstickers can be picked up
from most neighborhood Chinese restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Prices varied dramatically, but some were only slightly less
expensive than what you can buy at restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Potstickers were cooked according to package directions.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to  &UR; Trader Joe's &LR;  (16 ounces, $1.99). Two
panelists thought the filling was mushy, while two others found it
too sweet. But one panelist described this potsticker as ``thin and
delicate.'' Two would buy it, one might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ling Ling &LR;  (15 ounces, $3.89 at many supermarkets) came in
second. One panelist thought this brand looked the most like
restaurant versions. One liked the noodles in the filling, but
another did not. Another liked the vegetable filling but found the
seasoning peppery. One would buy it, three might buy it, and one
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores dropped dramatically to third place, which went to
 &UR; Health is Wealth Vegetable  &LR; (6.4 ounces, $3.19 at Whole Foods).
Four panelists did not like the appearance _ a little like
traditional potstickers _ but one liked the crispy exterior. One
panelist described the filling as fishy tasting; another thought it
was bland. None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring just six points below was  &UR; Health is Wealth Meatless &LR; 
(6.4 ounces, $4.39 at Whole Foods), which the package describes as
pork-free but with a ``delicious pork taste.'' Panelists didn't
agree, characterizing the tofu faux pork filling as unpleasant.
None would buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Patricia
Hart, dietitian and consultant; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For
All Seasons, San Francisco; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati,
San Francisco. All products are tasted blind.  &QL;  &QL;

 Like Butter  
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _  Those who claim that all Indian food
tastes alike _ and in many restaurants that's a legitimate
complaint _ need only to taste the Butter Chicken at Amber India in
Mountain View.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's little wonder it's the best-selling dish at the
restaurant. The sauce is an amazing amalgamation of tastes and
textures. Lemon, garlic, ginger, coriander and cumin mixed with
sweet spices adds to the flavor, while tomatoes balanced with
butter, cream and brown sugar smooth it all out.
</P>
<P>
   Before cooking, the chicken is marinated in yogurt and spices to
tenderize and add flavor. The chicken is then roasted on the bone.
Once the roasted chicken has cooled, the meat is removed from the
bone and added to the sauce simmering on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   The finished dish is best when accompanied by steamed rice.
</P>
<P>
   This is only one of the specialties at Amber India, owned by
Vijay Bist, who graduated from a culinary institute in New Delhi
before going into hotel management in India, Switzerland and
France. When he came to San Francisco, he completed a master's in
business administration at San Francisco State University.
</P>
<P>
   Bist's passion for Indian cooking led him to opening the
restaurant in 1995, featuring recipes mainly from the north.
</P>
<P>
   Located in a strip shopping center, the restaurant looks plain
from the outside. But once inside you're surrounded by the flavors
and look of India _ from the seductive smells floating from the
kitchen to the artwork on the walls to the impressive pots and
utensils used to present the food.
</P>
<P>
   While many dishes are spicy and aromatic, the key to the success
is lightness and balance, as in the Butter Chicken. Nothing is
fiery hot, but few dishes are subtle or bland, either, as you'll
find in other specialties, such as the Lamb with Peppercorn Curry
or the Chicken Korma made with a cashew nut base.

<P>
   2 tablespoons heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons ground fenugreek
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Make 3 parallel cuts on top of each piece of chicken. Place the
chicken in a resealable heavy-duty plastic bag. Combine the lemon
juice, red pepper flakes and salt; pour over the chicken. Seal the
bag and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the yogurt and cream in a bowl; blend well. Mix together
the garlic paste, ginger paste, coriander, cumin, garam masala and
salt. Add to the yogurt mixture, blending thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   When the chicken has marinated for 30 minutes, remove it from
the refrigerator, open the bag and pour in the yogurt mixture.
Reseal the bag and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Combine the ginger, ground chile, garam
masala, mace, nutmeg, white pepper and brown sugar in a small bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add
the tomatoes, tomato paste, the spice/ sugar blend and water.
Simmer, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes. Add more water if the
mixture gets too dry.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the chicken from the marinade; discard the marinade.
Arrange the chicken pieces in a baking pan large enough to hold
them in a single layer. Bake for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Let the chicken cool until you can handle it, then remove the
meat from the bones in bite-size pieces; discard bones. Add the
chicken meat, the cream and fenugreek to the sauce. Simmer for 10
minutes, stirring frequently to prevent burning. Taste, and add
salt if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Ginger paste and garlic paste are available in jars.
Look for them in Asian markets, and supermarkets that have large
ethnic-food sections.

 HERE COME THE STARS: Young Bay Area Chefs on the Rise   &HT;     By Miriam Morgan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Siegel seems like an unlikely candidate for a
French-inspired chef. The child of vagabonds, he and his family
moved so many times that he wound up living in the same Palo Alto
house twice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sometime during those itinerant growing-up years, the
talented 32-year-old chef of Charles Nob Hill, the jewellike
40-seat restaurant at Jones and Clay streets in San Francisco,
found that cooking gave him the satisfaction no other career did.
</P>
<P>
   It began in a butcher shop. When he was 16, Siegel took a job
with John's Town and Country Market in Palo Alto and learned how to
cut up chicken, meat and fish. ``I liked working with my hands and
was into it. I liked the atmosphere. Plus it was a lot of money at
the time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several years, Siegel worked in everything from
construction to maintenance. ``But I kept coming back to
restaurants,'' he says. ``I like how kitchens are organized in a
certain way and how your workday is broken up doing different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was when he moved to San Francisco, enrolled in the
California Culinary Academy and landed a job at Aqua that he really
saw what the restaurant world was like. He found his first mentor
in George Morrone, Aqua's opening chef, who in turn landed him a
job at the four-star Daniel in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a European-style kitchen where they spoke French and
there were about 30 cooks. I wasn't sure I made the right
decision,'' he says. But it was there he met renowned chef Thomas
Keller, and when Keller moved to Napa to open French Laundry, he
brought Siegel with him as sous chef.
</P>
<P>
   With just a half-dozen chefs in the Laundry's kitchen, ``you had
to set everything up yourself,'' Siegel says. But the French style
was similar to Restaurant Daniel _ and that's what he likes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at Charles Nob Hill, again working for Aqua owner Charles
Condy, Siegel fuses his skills and his passion for French-inspired
food, creating his own a la carte and prix fixe menus and serving
them on lovely china in an elegant setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like making things look beautiful but simple,'' says the
one-time construction worker. ``I don't have things flying off the
plate or things like fried herbs. I take the classical French
technique and update the impression of what the dish should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ``impressions'' include serving snails with spring garlic
right now and spring onions sliced paper thin and sweated in butter
to go under a perfect morsel of lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Lobster, it would seem, would be one of his favorite ingredients
(he claims it isn't), having been the basis for his highly
publicized Iron Chef television show last January. In the popular
Japanese show, seen here on some cable stations, he became the
first American chef to best the reigning Japanese ``champion'' in a
one-hour cook-off. His dishes of lobster ravioli and lobster with
seared foie gras, braised artichokes and wild mushrooms won an
unprecedented unanimous decision from the judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business at the restaurant doubled after that, but that's not
really me _ `bringing home the gold.' You have to ask yourself,
`Are you a chef or a celebrity?' I'm a chef. I just like to cook.
You'll never see me in Las Vegas, I'll guarantee you that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAN-SEARED SQUAB BREASTS WITH ENGLISH PEA RAVIOLI, MORELS &AMP; PEA &LR; 
 &UR; TENDRILS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 squabs (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup + 1 tablespoon olive oil, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   4 tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 pound morel mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   2 shallots, minced
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Ravioli &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds English peas, shelled
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup mascarpone cheese
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   16 round wonton wrappers (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Garnish &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1 cup pea shoots, optional (available at Whole Foods or Asian
markets)
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For the squab jus (stock) and morels: &LR;  Take the reserved bird
bodies (including legs) and remove and discard any skin and fat.
Using a large knife or cleaver, cut the bodies through the bone
into small pieces. Heat a heavy-bottom stock pot; add 1/4 cup of
the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the cut-up bones and brown
for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once the bones have
browned, discard the oil. Add 1/4 cup water to the pot, stirring to
incorporate all the browned bits. Boil down until the water
``crackles.'' Add 8 cups water, along with the tomatoes and thyme.
Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer for 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the stems from the morels. Place the trimmings into the
stock for additional flavor. Slice the mushrooms into rounds and
soak in warm water to clean for about 10 minutes. Dry mushrooms and
set aside.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the ravioli: &LR;  Bring 2 quarts water to a boil in a large
saucepan. Add 1/4 cup salt (it should taste like saltwater). Add
the peas and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, until tender. Drain and
drop peas into a bowl of ice water. When cool, drain and puree
them; strain through a fine-mesh sieve. Mix in the mascarpone _ it
should bind and flavor the puree. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To assemble the ravioli:  &LR; Brush 1 wonton wrapper very lightly
with beaten egg. Place a scant tablespoon of the pea puree in the
center of the wrapper, leaving a 1/2-inch border around the
perimeter. Place another wrapper on top, carefully aligning it with
the bottom wrapper. Press the edges together while pushing the
puree toward the center, and smooth down the seal. Make sure the
seal is clear of puree and that there are no air pockets in the
ravioli, or they will burst open while cooking. Cover the finished
ravioli loosely with plastic wrap or parchment paper to keep it
from drying out.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat this procedure, forming 7 more ravioli (you may have
leftover filling).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To finish the dish:  &LR; Clean the pea shoots by plucking the
leaves from the stems. Toss the shoots in a drizzle of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   After the squab stock has finished cooking, strain it through a
fine-mesh sieve into a saucepan. Boil over high heat until reduced
to 1/2 cup (this takes about 15 minutes). Whisk in 3 tablespoons of
the butter; set aside and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate pan, saute the shallots in the remaining 1
tablespoon butter for 5 minutes. Add the reserved morels and saute
for a few minutes until soft. Add to the squab stock; keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Season the squab breasts and liver with salt and pepper. Place a
skillet over medium-high heat, then add 1 tablespoon olive oil.
When the oil is hot, add the squab breasts and saute quickly, no
more than 2 or 3 minutes per side (the breasts should be on the
rare side). Remove the breasts from the pan and keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Add more oil to the pan if necessary, then saute the livers
quickly, for about 1 minute. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the ravioli
and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the pasta is al dente and the
filling heated through. You may have to cook the ravioli in batches
to prevent them from sticking to each other.
</P>
<P>
   For each serving, place a spoonful or two of squab jus (with
morels) on a warm plate, add 2 ravioli, top with 2 squab breasts,
then a portion of liver. Garnish with pea shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; When purchasing the squabs, ask the butcher to remove
the breasts (ask for skinless airline breasts) and to reserve the
body for you, including the livers.
</P>
<P>
   For the ravioli, Siegel uses fresh pasta cut into 4-inch rounds
instead of wonton wrappers, and serves 1 per plate.

 &LR; Lots of chefs want to cook, but few follow the trail as doggedly
as Richard Reddington.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with a business degree from Miami University in Ohio,
Reddington went to work selling Hallmark cards in Indiana. After
three years, he decided he wanted to make a career in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he had absolutely no training, he wasn't deterred.
He wrote Roland Passot of La Folie, and when he didn't hear back,
he simply showed up at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Passot agreed to let the then 25-year-old wannabe chef hang
around with him for the day. Reddington asked to stay on as a
non-paid kitchen helper, and Passot agreed. After several months of
working 12 hours a day six days a week, Reddington told Passot he
needed an income, so Passot put him on the payroll. Reddington
stayed about two years before spreading his wings at Fran Gage's
now-shuttered bakery and at Postrio as a line cook.

   He zigged to New York and cooked at Park Avenue Cafe, then
zagged back to San Francisco to work for Traci Des Jardins at
Rubicon. From there he took off for a seven-month training stint in
France, where he talked his way into several three-star
restaurants, including Arpege in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Chef/owner Alain Passart let him take over the meat station
after a one-day, sink-or-swim tryout. Not speaking much French
became an advantage because, Reddington explains, ``I didn't know
why he was yelling at me.''
</P>
<P>
   On his return to the United States, Reddington donned chefs'
whites at Daniel in New York for about seven months and then moved
to Southern California to open Spago Beverly Hills. Then back to
San Francisco, where he became chef de cuisine at Jardiniere under
Des Jardins.
</P>
<P>
   Reddington decided to take a break and was riding his bike past
Chapeau, on Geary Boulevard near 22nd Avenue, when he saw owner
Philippe Gardelle, who had worked with him at La Folie. Gardelle
needed a chef, and Reddington decided to help out. He's been there
five months.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the places he has worked have been more intense and
expensive than at Chapeau, where entree prices are around $15. But
Reddington sees this type of cooking as a way to learn more. It has
taken him five months to learn to make a cassoulet that meets his
own standards, and crafting bistro food has perfected his ability
to make terrines and sauces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt that I matured quickly, but still I have a lot
to learn,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His style, he says, is to coax the most flavor out of each
ingredient and to combine flavors so they support each other.
Achieving this marriage of flavors can be learned, he acknowledges,
but ``some cooks get it and some cooks don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He does. His combinations are fresh and vibrant, but the flavors
are never jarring. He makes a chestnut leek soup, for example,
that's perfectly balanced with the tart-sweet addition of apples.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Chapeau is not the last stop on his culinary journey.
``What I'll do is play off some of the things I've learned. I'll
take those skills with me, but I probably won't do a cassoulet.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he will stay at Chapeau long enough to train a chef to
carry on. His next goal is to open a restaurant where he can have
three or four other chefs to help him put out his style of
contemporary French cooking.
</P>
<P>
   His parents at first didn't understand his passion for cooking,
but they're learning by tasting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love going home and just cooking for my family,'' he says.
``This is what I am, this is what I'm doing.''

 &UR; CREAMY BRANDADE OF SALT COD &AMP; POTATOES WITH GARLIC CROUTONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 pound boned salt cod
</P>
<P>
   2 heads garlic
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 bunch thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 pound russet potatoes, peeled and cut into eighths
</P>
<P>
   About 1/2 gallon milk
</P>
<P>
   Salt, if needed and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil + oil for baguette slices
</P>
<P>
   1 baguette
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Soak the salt cod in water to cover for 48 hours, changing the
water several times.
</P>
<P>
   Break the heads of garlic into individual cloves, gently
smashing the cloves, then peel them. Save 1 clove for the croutons.
Cover the remaining cloves with olive oil and simmer gently for 20
minutes, or until the garlic turns golden brown. Remove from heat
and throw in the thyme.
</P>
<P>
   Place the potatoes in a saucepan and pour in water to cover.
Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until tender; drain.
Rice the potatoes and keep them warm.
</P>
<P>
   Drain the salt cod and place in a saucepan. Pour in enough milk
just to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer gently for 8
to 10 minutes. Drain. Add another 1 cup milk and bring to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the potatoes, the cod and 3/4 cup of the boiling milk,
and the garlic and its cooking oil (discard the thyme) in a food
processor. Process until smooth (don't overwork or it will become
gummy). Add remaining 1/4 cup milk if the brandade is too thick.
Season with salt, if necessary and pepper. Finish with the extra
virgin olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the baguette on the bias into croutons. Toss or brush with a
little olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toast until
golden in a 400 degree oven. Rub with the reserved garlic clove
(cut in half, if desired).
</P>
<P>
   Portion the brandade onto heated plates and surround with
croutons.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8 to 10.

 &UR; PROFILE: CHAD CALLAHAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Michael Bauer &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; For eight years, Chad Callahan worked in the shadow of Julian
Serrano at Masa's. When the respected four-star chef left last year
to open Picasso in the Bellagio Hotel and Resort in Las Vegas,
Callahan stepped into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   For most people in the food world, he was an unknown, just as
Serrano was when he took over the restaurant nearly a decade
earlier. Few people, save for the chef and the kitchen crew, know
the sous chef of the major restaurants, even though they do most of
the hands-on work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I walked in the door, I felt very natural and I
knew I wanted to rise up in the ranks,'' Callahan says.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old chef has had a passion for food as long as he
can remember. His father was one of the founders of the Chart House
steak-and-seafood restaurant, and his mother was French and loved
to cook. Callahan remembers first working in the restaurant when he
was 10 years old.
</P>
<P>
   He loved it so much that he wanted to start cooking right out of
high school, but his father convinced him go to college for at
least two years. Callahan went to California State University at
Chico on a football scholarship and after he did his time, he
enrolled at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He worked at several places before landing at Masa's, but the
bulk of his training has been there. Slowly Callahan is changing
the menu to include such dishes as the Black Striped Bass Gratinee
(see recipe).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my flavors will be a little bolder,'' he says.
''Julian was really into texture.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his favorite foods is a bowl of steamed clams, but when
he first took over he didn't see how he could put something that
simple on the menu. Now he's reconsidering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel as if the rules have really changed now about what
people are deeming four-star food. I think they want things that
are approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still he knows he can't stray radically from the Masa's
tradition, and he really doesn't want to. He has worked so long
under Serrano that he's just beginning to get a feel for his own
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm still working on that myself, to be completely
honest.''

SETTLEMENT MONEY TO BE WEIGHTED TOWARD INDIVIDUAL INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Individual investors will be given an edge over
institutional investors in the distribution of about $1 billion
that Nasdaq dealers paid to settle a landmark 1994 antitrust
class-action case accusing them of fixing prices on Nasdaq shares.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan that lawyers expect to mail to Nasdaq investors
next month, all investors will share in the settlement fund based
on how many Nasdaq trades they made during the seven-year period
covered by the settlement, which was the largest in antitrust
history.
</P>
<P>
   But under the plan, each trade by an individual investor will be
give 50 percent more weight in the calculations than a trade by an
institutional investor.
</P>
<P>
   The typical institutional investors will still collect far more
than an individual, of course, because the volume of an
institution's Nasdaq trades is so much larger than that of a
typical individual investor. But the arrangement means that
individual investors will get more of the settlement fund than they
otherwise would have, class-action lawyers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Grundfest, a Stanford University law professor and former
member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he believed
the distinction made between individuals and institutions ``may be
the first of its kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was first reported by James M. Newman, the
publisher and editor of Securities Class-Action Alert, a newsletter
that monitors securities litigation. Newman, too, called the
preferential treatment for individual investors surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not another example of it that I can think of,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lovell, a member of the legal team that pursued the
novel antitrust class-action case, said the unusual formula was
simply the result of the routine practice of trying to distribute a
settlement in ways that reflect the reality of the harm that was
done.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, institutional investors were able to trade Nasdaq
stocks on private trading networks, such as Instinet, where they
could routinely get better prices than those available to
individual investors. As a consequence, institutions suffered less
from the price-fixing activity charged in the antitrust litigation
than individual investors did, Lovell said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual distribution formula was part of an overall
distribution plan that received preliminary approval from federal
Judge Robert W. Sweet in Manhattan on March 9. Objections to the
plan will be heard by Sweet in October, and all investors' claims
must be filed by December.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell said the settlement administrators hope to distribute the
money to investors late next year, but Newman said he thought that
target was ``very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula favoring individual investors was devised with help
from a group of deputy attorneys general from various states. ``We
felt that they could be neutral because their constituents include
both citizens, as individual investors, and their own state pension
funds, as institutions,'' Lovell said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Perino, a law professor at St. John's University in New
York who studies class-action litigation, agreed that the formula
is unusual. But he said he doubted it would be copied in future
securities class-action cases because such cases typically hinged
on the decline in the stock's price, which affects all investors in
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution plan is the latest step in a journey that began
in May 1994, when a team of class-action lawyers accused 37 major
brokerage companies, including Merrill Lynch; Lehman Brothers;
Goldman, Sachs; Salomon Smith Barney _ now part of Citigroup _ and
Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, of artificially fixing prices on
Nasdaq stock they traded between May 1989 and mid-July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Nasdaq dealers were accused of conspiring to
inflate their own profits by artificially widening the gap between
the price at which investors could buy a Nasdaq stock and the price
at which they could sell it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which experts considered to be a long shot,
prompted the Justice Department and the SEC to undertake their own
investigations of the Nasdaq market. Those inquiries, in turn, led
to far-reaching changes aimed at making the market fairer for all
investors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, most of the defendants settled price-collusion charges
filed by the Justice Department. Earlier this year, the SEC
collected more than $26 million in fines from 28 Wall Street firms
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Sweet awarded the class-action lawyers a
record-setting fee of $144 million for their work on the case,
about 14 percent of the settlement award, plus $4.4 million in
expenses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Scot Ellis confesses he has a stubborn streak.
If you want to bring it out, just tell him he can't do something.
</P>
<P>
   The world's top-ranked jumper in the sport of water skiing, the
Lakeland resident was told after a spectacular crash in July 1995
that he would never walk again without a limp. Don't even think
about skiing, the doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admit that did motivate me a little bit,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   A year after the injury, he was named to the U.S. Water Ski
team.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the crash, he finished second in jumping on the
pro water skiing tour.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 27, he is ranked first in the world, based on 1998
performances in which he jumped more than 200 feet 50 times. No one
else has accomplished that in one year.
</P>
<P>
   His personal best is 220 feet, two feet under the world record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone 230 in practice,'' he said. ``But it doesn't count
unless you do it in a record-capability tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis was born on June 14, 1971, in Laurel, Miss., but grew up
in Lakeland. When he was 4 or 5, he saw a Lakeland Water Ski Club
show on Lake Hollingsworth. He liked what he saw. By age 8, he was
competing in tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came to us very young,'' said Chuck Dees of Lakeland, who
was Ellis' first coach. ``We taught him to jump and to jump
properly. You have to learn it properly or I won't let you jump.
Scot learned very easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listened and then was able to go out there and do what you
had told him,'' Dees said. ``He was a three-event skier for a long
time before he specialized in jumping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved skiing,'' Ellis said. ``I could go skiing every
weekend and get a trophy every time. By the time I was 10, I had a
room full.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis competed in national events as a junior skier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of in the middle of the pack until 1988 or '89,''
he said. ``Then I sort of took off.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-7 and 175 pounds, Ellis is smaller than most skiers
who compete at the top level, but he beat the big guys
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, he won the boys' world, national and Junior Olympics
championships. At age 17, he set two Men 1 (ages 17-24) national
jump records at 177 and 179 feet. He made the U.S. Water Ski team
at 20 and placed second in the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest success came in Australia at the Moomba Masters,
the water ski event that attracts the largest crowds in the world _
up to 200,000 spectators. Ellis placed second in 1993, first in
1994 with a site record of 203 feet, first in 1997 with a site
record of 216, first in 1998 and first in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he set the Men 2 (ages 25-34) jump record at 199 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the pro water ski circuit in 1990 and placed first on
the tour in his rookie season. Since then, except for the injury
year, he's ranked in the top four.
</P>
<P>
   He is constantly making minor adjustments in the style that
earned him the nickname ``Rocketman'' on the tour. He is one of the
most popular skiers on the tour, and the only one with his own
poster.
</P>
<P>
   His injury in 1995 occurred at an Indianapolis tournament when
an arm binder broke. Binders are designed to keep his position
aligned on the jump ramp where skiers reach speeds of more than 75
mph. He dislocated his hip and suffered nerve damage that made him
lose feeling in his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Two doctors gave gloomy predictions, so he went to a third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he figured out exactly what the problems were, we had a
place to start,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   A neurologist found the dislocation. A chiropractor started him
on a long and ongoing rehabilitation process.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling in his leg and foot are slowly returning, but he wears
braces and tapes his ankles when he jumps. After his accident, he
hung out at his parent's home on Lake Tennessee in Auburndale and
watched other skiers train. He coached some of them and listened to
their words of encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the rehabilitation process began, he went back
to Indianapolis for a tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was almost dead last, maybe 14th out of 15,'' he
said. ``But I was so happy, I didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 1996 season, he was jumping 200 feet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not skiing as well as I did when I was 18,'' he
said. ``But I'm improving.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis credits his parents, Roger and Janifer, and his sister,
Shelly, along with the unwavering support of his sponsors with
helping in his comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of my sponsors kept me,'' he said. ``I figured some of
them would drop me. I'll always be grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister, a student at the University of Central Florida,
understands the long healing process after an injury. When she was
6, she fell out of a boat and was cut severely; she now uses an
artificial leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scot was always there; he never let me give up no matter how
much I was hurting,'' she said. ``No one realizes just how close we
are.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was hurt, he told me he finally understood what I was
going through; I think it was a humbling experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Scot Ellis' goals are to win another pro jumping title and to
promote a new event called ``ski flying.''
</P>
<P>
   By lengthening the ski ramp, lengthening the tow rope and
increasing boat speeds, jumpers are making stunning distances.
</P>
<P>
   The ski flying was developed by five-time world champion Bruce
Neville, who is now 36. He and Ellis have pioneered a sport which
already has skiers going more than 270 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only a matter of time until we reach 300,'' said
Neville, a frequent visitor to the Ellis home.
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to see four or five of the top jumpers in the
world train together. They take turns driving boats, spotting each
other and giving technical advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scot is a technician, and that may have held him back in years
past, but he's started to be more aggressive,'' Neville said. ``He
still has that tremendous style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had some tough going, but he is definitely the best U.S.
skier.''

 &HT;    Congressman seeks marriage of technology, privacy
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Internet usage rising markedly among members
of Congress, elected officials are quickly learning about the power
and pitfalls of the on-line world.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) told a conference on lobbying and the
Internet Tuesday that the biggest challenge facing Congress in this
area is resisting legislation that threatens Americans' privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that the Internet and computers have taken from
us is privacy,'' Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he opposes administration efforts to expand the ability
of authorities to search and retrieve files on personal computers.
``If they can get a judge to issue a warrant, they'll have access
to snoop through your computer,'' Linder said. ``Just because they
have a warrant to search a closet doesn't give them the right to
look through your whole house.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder also applauded the decision of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation to withdraw its controversial ``know your
customer'' regulation. The proposal would have required banks to
monitor customers' daily usage of their accounts in order to
identify potential drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   American University's Center for Congressional Presidential
Studies sponsored the conference to take note of the Internet's
growing importance in the daily work of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   All but 41 of the 534 members of the House and Senate (there is
one vacancy) now have Web sites, said James Thurber, the center's
director. ``There is a demand from the public,'' Thurber said.
``And members also are going to do anything they can to communicate
with constituents as part of their desire to get re-elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder said he receives an increasing amount of correspondence
by e-mail, which he said is much better than a telephone call.
``It's usually well thought out and they don't tend to ramble,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that a lot of bad information also is
available on the Internet and that people sometimes cannot
distinguish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find I have more conspiracy theorists in my district than
before the Internet,'' he said.

HILLARY ON HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton joked at a recent White House
Correspondents' Association dinner that he and his wife Hillary
weren't scared of confronting the notoriously mean New York press;
it was the Manhattan co-op apartment boards they feared.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that if the first lady does indeed run for the
Senate seat being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, they will have trouble finding a place to live there.
(This blithely assumes that if she moves to New York, he will go
along. But, hey, never examine a joke too closely.)
</P>
<P>
   To laughter and applause, the president described an application
form unlikely to impress a finicky co-op board. Anticipated
employment? Unknown. Anticipated earnings? Unknown. Current
residence? Public housing. References? Nelson Mandela, the Dalai
Lama, Steven Spielberg. Outstanding debts? Williams &AMP; Connolly (his
defense lawyers).
</P>
<P>
   The first lady herself acknowledges to friends that she WANTS to
run, co-op boards or not. But she also insists she isn't fully
committed yet.
</P>
<P>
   She has recently made so many trips to New York and displayed so
much interest in arcane local issues, however, that she gives the
impression she is already campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker magazine wryly took note of her sudden
fascination with the state in a cartoon featuring a television
newscaster. The anchor announced, ``In a further effort to
ingratiate herself with New Yorkers, Hillary Clinton threw out the
first pitch at last night's Yankee game and went on to pitch three
scoreless innings.''
</P>
<P>
   In public at least, the president has been supportive. ``For 22
years now or more we've done what I wanted to do in terms of my
political career,'' he said in a television interview. ``So the
deal I made was she gets the next 22 years. ... I would be happy to
be the spouse of a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, the most likely Republican
Senate nominee, is taking Hillary Clinton seriously as a potential
competitor. In recent hypothetical contests, they emerge as
virtually evenly matched.
</P>
<P>
   He ridicules her carpetbagger status and complains on his Web
site that she has no connection to the state that would enable her
to properly represent it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think would happen if I got off a plane in
Arkansas and announced for the (U.S.) Senate?'' the mayor asks
appreciative Republican audiences. ``Where is Whitewater? Maybe I
could go to Whitewater ... '' He also accuses her of having no
sense of humor, although his own lack of that admirable quality has
often been noted.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, moving to New York while still technically occupying the
White House would be a tricky maneuver. She would not have to live
in the state while she campaigned. She is required only to have a
home address there by Election Day. But voters could come to resent
the fact that she is from out of state if she delays too long in
establishing residence there.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of what to do about Bill. Does he
move with her, or is this the perfect opportunity to set up
separate households? Her rocky marriage is bound to be a subtheme
in any campaign. Her current image as the long-suffering wronged
wife has reinforced her popularity. but it remains a delicate
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Recently she has begun to hint at the misery her husband's
roving eye has caused her but she continues to stand at his side
and praise his public policies.
</P>
<P>
   During a union-organized forum held at Buffalo State College
last week she gingerly ventured into that perilous personal
territory. The mostly female audience applauded her frankness.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question about family values, she smiled and
said gently, ``Marriages are hard. They are hard work. I'd be the
first to tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is clearly more comfortable talking about public
policy issues than she is revealing her private feelings. If this
policy wonk does run, she will not be caught unprepared on any
major issue. She does her homework, and it's not the kind that
involves pots and pans. She has the kind of discipline that might
actually lead her to pitch three scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the roles of a Senate candidate immersed in grassroots
politics and a global celebrity representing the nation on grand
issues of war and peace may not be as awkward as some Republicans
are suggesting. She is already blending the two.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for instance, she used a White House ceremony linked
to Mother's Day to call for congressional passage of new gun
control measures. The following day she was back in New York state
raising money for a Democratic congressman. Then at a U.S. airbase
in New Jersey she welcomed the first Kosovar Albanian refugees to
be given temporary shelter in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Monday she joined the president in a high-profile White House
conference on youth violence that proposed voluntary efforts to
identify and address possible causes. Then she flew to Ireland to
become the first woman to be granted the key to the city of Galway
and to receive an honorary degree from the university there.
</P>
<P>
   As a U.S. senator, she could have the best of both worlds. Why
does she want to run? Why not?

OWNERSHIP OF OAKLAND A'S NOW IN THE HANDS OF THE LEAGUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The jockeying over who will own the Oakland
A's now moves to Major League Baseball officials in New York, as
city and county officials strongly back a local group to take over
the baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland City Council and the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum
Authority voted Monday to support a group led by former A's
executive Andy Dolich, emphasizing that local ownership is the best
way to ensure the team stays in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Mayor Jerry Brown, City Council President Ignacio De La
Fuente and Councilman John Russo will go to New York in the next
few weeks to lobby Commissioner Bud Selig on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to make sure that Major League Baseball, the owners
and the commissioner know that we are 100 percent behind this
group,'' De La Fuente said.
</P>
<P>
   Dolich, a former executive vice president for the A's who heads
a group of mostly East Bay investors, said he'll fly to New York
within the next 10 days to make his pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is essentially additional conversations with the
decision-makers at Major League Baseball: team owners, members of
the ownership committee,'' Dolich said. ``I will continue what I've
done for basically the last 18 years of my life: I'll be speaking
to people about why Oakland A's baseball has an opportunity to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation of the City Council and the Coliseum
Authority was a victory for Dolich and his group, but they still
face several hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The would-be owners will still need the approval of 75 percent
of the American League club owners and a majority of National
League owners.
</P>
<P>
   And they must complete the sale within just a few months, or
else current team owners Steve Schott and Ken Hofmann can sell to a
rival group.
</P>
<P>
   Under the non-negotiable terms of the proposed sale, the buyer
must pay $122.4 million (including $2.4 million in commissions) to
Schott and Hofmann, and agree to keep the A's in Oakland at least
through 2004. The city and Coliseum Authority hired Game Plan LLC,
Boston investment bankers, to find and scrutinize potential local
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The group backed Monday is made up of Dolich, baseball Hall of
Famer Joe Morgan, Men's Wearhouse CEO George Zimmer, Modesto
supermarket mogul Robert Piccinini, the Alameda Newspaper
Group-owned Oakland Tribune and San Francisco advertising executive
Jeff Goodby.
</P>
<P>
   The rejected group is led by San Mateo lawyer and former bank
executive Michael Lazarus and includes Arizona banker Lyle
Campbell, former San Francisco Giants and Baltimore Orioles pitcher
Steve Stone, and Bob Watson, a former A's coach and New York
Yankees general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Lazarus group could still be involved as an alternate buyer.
If the Dolich team can't complete the sale by Sept. 20, the current
owners could entertain the competing bid.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, baseball's commissioner, said last week that he wanted
Oakland and Alameda County officials to send both bids for
consideration to baseball's owners. But the council rebuffed the
commissioner, saying it deserves to help pick the A's new owners
because city taxpayers had invested millions in city money in the
Coliseum and provided favorable leasing arrangements with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The council voted 8-0 for the Dolich group, citing the bidders'
longstanding ties to Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question you have to ask is which group has a critical
self-interest in working with the city and county to make baseball
work in the long term here in Oakland,'' said Russo. ``When you
look at the groups in that filter, it becomes a very easy
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who railed against city officials' deal to bring back
the Oakland Raiders football team, waded into the treacherous world
of professional sports in Oakland for the first time by supporting
the Dolich group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oakland is coming back,'' Brown said. ``It's in the midst of a
very powerful revitalization and this is another step in that
direction, with local people continuing to support their baseball
team.''

IMPEACH YELTSIN? DUMP PRIMAKOV? RUSSIA FACES ANOTHER CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The parliament is priming itself for a vote to impeach
the president, on charges that he brought Russia to ruin. The
president's men talk darkly of dumping the prime minister, accusing
him of leading the country back to its Communist past.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Russia's latest political crisis, where rumors are
rife, and political intriguers have already unsheathed their knives
for a showdown Saturday, when the impeachment of President Boris
Yeltsin is due to come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the fate of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's
eight-month-old government has also been thrown into the balance,
amid loud hints from the Kremlin that it has outlived its
usefulness as a guarantor of political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Russian crises, this one, too, may pass. But for the
moment, all those involved are doing their best to keep the
country's nerves on edge _ at a time when Russia is deeply involved
in delicate diplomacy to end the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's own record of bizarre and unpredictable behavior has
added to the uneasy mood in Moscow. In recent appearances, he has
seemed unsteady on his feet, even incoherent, blurting out
incomplete sentences before television cameras and screwing up his
face in an unsightly scowl as he dressed down top aides in public.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, Yeltsin and his dwindling team of Kremlin
advisers have seemed bent on cutting back Primakov's authority _ by
firing one of his top ministers, by purposefully sidelining him at
public events and by privately painting him as an agent of the
Communist opposition, which has given him its support in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   That support was the key to Primakov's nomination as a
compromise candidate to head the government last fall. It has been
the source of his own power, and independence from a resentful
Kremlin and his popularity as the man who saved Russia from the
brink of a full-blown crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But according to his critics, including those within the
presidential administration, it is also the reason for his
government's paralysis, particularly in the economic sphere.
</P>
<P>
   In a public rebuke Monday, Grigori Yavlinsky, the head of the
parliament's largest liberal party who first nominated Primakov
last fall, accused the government of do-nothing policies, which he
said were reminiscent of the ``era of stagnation'' under former
Soviet Communist party leader Leonid Brezhnev.
</P>
<P>
   As the impeachment vote nears, rumors of Primakov's pending
dismissal _ or forced resignation _ have again resurfaced, stirring
speculation that Yeltsin may be looking for an excuse to disband
the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Even in his current weakened position, Yeltsin still has the
power to make such threats come true, which may be enough to give
his opposition pause. When, and whether, he chooses to exercise
that power has become a popular Moscow guessing game here, and one
that the Kremlin's master intriguer seems intent on manipulating to
his own advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Russian parliament's lower house was due to
take up a five-count impeachment charge against Yeltsin, its
members voted to postpone. Many analysts expect them to do the same
this time, in part because they are unlikely to collect the 300
votes necessary to make the impeachment charges stick.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five impeachment charges, only one _ accusing Yeltsin of
waging an illegal war in Chechnya from 1994 to 1996 _ has the
support of both liberals and Communists in the 450-member lower
house. The other charges involve the breakup of the Soviet Union,
the shelling of the parliament in 1993, the collapse of the Russian
military, and the ``genocide'' of the Russian people.
</P>
<P>
   Any charges approved by the lower house would then have to first
clear the Russian constitutional court, then the Supreme Court and
finally the parliament's upper house before Yeltsin could be
removed from office. The chances of clearing these hurdles before
Yeltsin's second presidential term expires in the summer of 2000
are very slight.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin has repeatedly urged the lower house to go ahead with
the impeachment vote, and remove it from the agenda. But
postponement of the vote has proved useful to his Communist-led
opposition, which has made the ouster of Yeltsin its chief
political slogan in the run up to December's parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   With the impeachment debate due to begin Thursday, Primakov on
Tuesday again came out publicly against any attempt to dislodge
Yeltsin, telling parliamentary leaders that he is ``categorically''
against an impeachment drive that he said threatens the country's
political stability.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's aides Tuesday also denied reports that they have
readied plans for a dismissal of the government. But according to
one of the participants, Primakov told parliamentary leaders
Tuesday that he himself would step down if the Kremlin tried to
force the resignation of his two top remaining Communist ministers,
Yuri Maslyukov and Gennady Kulik.

ONLINE STOCK TRADING FIRMS FORM KEY ALLIANCES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The landscape of the stock-trading business continued to shift
Tuesday, as Instinet, the dominant private trading system, and its
scrappy rival, Island ECN Inc., announced potentially important
alliances with other players.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet, a unit of Reuters Group PLC, is paying $20 million for
an 11.4 percent stake in W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., the brainchild of
Silicon Valley financier William Hambrecht. Hambrecht operates the
OpenIP0 system, an online auction-based system for underwriting
initial public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Trading in initial public offerings has become a sore topic
among online investors. Almost weekly, small investors who cannot
have their orders filled watch in frustration as an initial
offering, initially priced in the teens for the few institutions
able to buy, soars.
</P>
<P>
   Instinet chief executive Douglas Atkin said the current
situation hurt both the companies and the individual investors. If
a stock is priced at $19 and the first trade is at $30, ``that is
money that's coming out of the company's coffers and being given to
a few big institutions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, Hambrecht's auction system is fairer to individual
investors and allows the company to keep more of the money
investors are willing to pay for its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Atkin said Instinet would soon develop links to allow its
institutional members to submit their orders to Hambrecht's
auctions directly over Instinet. In addition, the two companies are
negotiating a joint venture that would allow Instinet to export the
initial-public-offering auction service to Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   For Island, the news Tuesday was that Waterhouse Investor
Services Inc., a subsidiary of Toronto-Dominion Bank and a
substantial discount brokerage firm here and in Canada, would buy a
12.5 percent stake in Island for $25 million. An agreement in
principle has been reached, and final papers should be signed in
the next two months, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Island, a subsidiary of Datek Online Holdings
Corp., said the fresh capital would help Island build the
infrastructure it would need if it were granted stock-exchange
status by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   At present, Island runs a distant second to Instinet in the
proliferating field of electronic communications networks, or ECNs,
the computerized systems that match buy and sell orders that
brokers submit for their customers. &QL;

RESEARCHERS SAY GAS ADDITIVE DOESN'T CUT SMOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An ingredient added to gasoline to curb auto air
pollution, but blamed for increases in water pollution, does little
to reduce smog, according to a study released Tuesday by the
National Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the study credits tough air-quality regulations,
reformulated gasoline and vehicle improvements over the last few
decades for having ``substantially cut the emissions that help
create near-ground ozone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the study, designed to compare additives, the researchers
found that MTBE _ methyl tertiary butyl ether _ is more effective
than ethanol in reducing ozone, a major component of smog. But the
overall impact of either additive on reducing ozone is very small,
the study says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motor-vehicle emissions of chemicals that form ozone pollution
have decreased in recent years,'' said committee Chairman William
Chameides, regents' professor of air and atmospheric sciences at
the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's largely because of better emissions control
equipment and components of reformulated gasolines _ other than
oxygen additives _ that improve air quality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although additives reduce some pollutants from motor vehicles,
Chameides said, the oxygenates appear to have little impact on
lowering ozone levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, it's not possible to attribute a significant portion
of past reductions in smog to the use of these gasoline
additives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Robert Perciasepe, assistant administrator in the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Air and Radiation,
said the agency supports the technical findings of the independent
federal research council, an arm of the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Perciasepe didn't agree with Chameides' statement that the
oxygenated reformulated gasoline does little to reduce smog.
</P>
<P>
   He credits a 20 percent reduction in smog-forming emission from
reformulated gasoline containing the additives. The presence of
oxygen also curbs toxic emissions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is investigating the environmental effects of oxygen
fuel additives, Perciasepe said. He expects the results in July.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA, the lead enforcement agency under the federal Clean Air
Act, which requires the additives in areas that violate ozone
standards, is the last remaining holdout in support of the
oxygenates, particularly MTBE.
</P>
<P>
   Touted as a clean-air savior a decade ago, MTBE has leaked from
underground fuel tanks into 10,000 wells in California, including
drinking water supplies in South Lake Tahoe, Santa Monica and in
Napa, Mendocino and Orange counties. In March, the governor
announced that MTBE would be banned in California by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   State regulators, oil refiners and environmentalists welcomed
the study, saying they believe MTBE is doing more harm than good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The air board has felt for some time that you can make the
reformulated gasoline without using the oxygenates,'' said Allan
Hirsch, a state Air Resources Board spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report helps bolster the argument that there should not
be a federal requirement for oxygenated gasoline in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Denny Larson, Northern California director of Communities for a
Better Environment, called MTBE a menace. His group, which sued the
oil companies last year alleging that the industry has long known
of MTBE's potential to leak to groundwater, supports efforts by
refineries to make the gasoline burn cleaner without the use of
additives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't believe it was ever proven that oxygenates were
necessary to make cleaner gasoline, and the recent studies,
including an earlier University of California study, bear this
out,'' Larson said. ``The oxygenates have allowed the oil companies
to make a higher profit by putting in other chemicals to dilute
gasoline.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ It seems that a teen-ager's life is one big
government-created paradox. A 15-year-old is old enough to get a
job, yet too young to vote for the people who set the minimum wage.
Old enough to drive a vehicle, but too young to be out alone at
night. Old enough to be punished like an adult, but too young to be
treated like one. And if the Texas Legislature this session doesn't
add a few more caveats to a teen-ager's rights _ such that they are
_ it's not for lack of trying. By KAREN BROOKS. Story has moved in

<P>
   UNDATED _ In the mid-1870s, long after Texas claimed its
independence from Mexico and the United States settled the Civil
War, North Texans were still brawling with the Plains Indians over
exactly who owned the land. The battles, probably more than 20 in
all, were called the Red River War, and they ranged from the summer
of 1874 into early 1875. Now, because of more than $100,000 in new
grants, the Texas Historical Commission is setting out to detail
that war by locating the battle sites, generating site records and
maps, nominating sites to the National Register of Historic Places,
and working with area museums to exhibit findings. By ART CHAPMAN.

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Emiliana Vega has an emergency plan in case a
tornado touches down near her Irving apartment: Hide in the closet
and stay out of the path of flying glass.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old native of Guanajuato, Mexico, learned her simple
blueprint for safety from Spanish-language news broadcasts and her
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many times we see the images, but we don't know everything
they are saying,'' Vega said in Spanish, referring to the English
news stations.
</P>
<P>
   Vega is not alone. Across the Metroplex, there are tens of
thousands of non-English-speaking people who depend on
word-of-mouth and foreign language media to find out when severe
weather is looming.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, where the Hispanic population is projected to reach
more than 6.3 million by next year, National Weather Service
officials are talking about providing Spanish weather warnings on
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Weather Radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue that we are discussing at the highest level of
our agency. ... How can we get information to non-English-speaking
individuals?'' said Rick Dittman, NOAA Weather Radio and
dissemination meteorologist with the agency's Southern Region
Headquarters in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, Calif., the National Weather Service hopes to have
a Spanish NOAA system in place in two to three years, said Ed
Clark, warning coordination meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can hope that at least the states that border Mexico will
do that,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is the
federal agency that oversees the National Weather Service. NOAA's
nationwide network of radio stations broadcasts continual weather
information such as warnings, watches, forecasts and other hazards
24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the ``Voice of the National Weather Service,'' NOAA
Weather Radio is a public service found on radio frequencies,
television and weather scanners. The National Weather Service
provides Spanish forecasts and warnings via the Internet, and on
the NOAA Weather Radio in San Juan, Puerto Rico _ where English is
the second language.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the needs of changing demographics is important in
reaching as many people as possible, Dittman said.
</P>
<P>
   What has proved effective in capturing the Spanish-speaking
audience is the Emergency Alert System, a joint effort among the
National Weather Service, local media and emergency personnel that
sends out warnings of danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we issue a warning, if there's a Spanish station, they
receive the product and translate the warning for listeners,''
Dittman said. ``Your Spanish-speaking channel is no different than
Channel 8 or 5. It's just in Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Ramirez, a newscaster for radio station KESS/1270 AM this
week aired tornado tips such as keep calm, move away from windows
and don't attempt to outrun a twister in a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who don't speak English,'' Ramirez
said. ``What we do is important. We tell people how to protect
themselves in case there is a tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   Silvia Quijada, 32, of Irving, a native of El Salvador, learned
about the tornadoes that hit Oklahoma and Kansas last week through
the Spanish media. She said the tragedy made her wonder what to do
if a tornado hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about my children,'' she said. ``It is important to
take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Elvia Wallace-Martinez, host of a Spanish-language Christian
radio show in Irving, said the information gap is an issue with
first-generation Latino immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are at a higher level of assimilation they will know
English,'' Wallace-Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue isn't unique to Latinos. The Metroplex has a
potpourri of cultures and languages evidenced in the alternative
media and organizations aimed at helping immigrants start anew in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based Radio Korea Christian Station, an independent
station that is not on the AM/FM radio bands, translates weather
reports from local English newspapers for its audience.
</P>
<P>
   Asli Parker, president of the Somali Outreach Center in Euless,
has soothed the weather fears of Somali refugees who have never
experienced a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very scared,'' said Parker, who told them how to
prepare. ``They said, `We heard they have bad weather in Oklahoma.
Are we going to have the same weather?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sing Boulom, a public service officer with the Haltom City
Police Department, said the the non-English-speaking Southeast
Asian community is largely shut out, and word-of-mouth is key to
finding safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information is not available so they don't know about it _
unless they know English or the tornado hits their roof,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It would be comforting to think that the
horrifying combination of children, guns and violence in Littleton,
Colo., is an anomaly, but unfortunately, it is not.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Trenchcoat Mafia'' are not the only children using guns
and bombs. At least 300,000 children under the age of 18 _ some as
young as 8 _ serve in government armies or rebel groups in
Afghanistan, Angola, Colombia, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and other
conflicts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Children are forcibly recruited or sometimes volunteer,
pressured by a culture of violence, or they are driven to join
because they are poor or orphaned. Boys and girls serve as
messengers, spies and cooks. Girls are turned into ``wives'' or
concubines forced to serve groups of soldiers. Children are also
used in combat to make and deploy mines, to ambush enemy patrols or
even to fight on the front lines.
</P>
<P>
   There are no international standards to protect children in
armed conflict. The primary international treaty, the Convention on
the Rights of the Child, contains a glaring inconsistency: It
articulates 18 as the age of majority to protect the rights of
children in all areas, with the sole exception of the provisions on
recruitment and participation in armed conflict, which define an
adult as 15 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The international community has begun to take steps to address
the lack of protection for these children. In 1995, under the
auspices of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, negotiations began
to raise the age for military recruitment and service from 15 to
18.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the recruitment and use of children younger than 15 was
proposed as a war crime under the statute of the proposed
International Criminal Court. Many countries have indicated their
willingness to adopt or consider adopting the new standard,
including Australia, Canada and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, has refused to do so, and in fact
contributed to the collapse of negotiations on the new standard a
year ago. Worse, the U.S. Defense Department has since sought to
undermine international support on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon objects to raising the age to 18 because U.S.
military recruitment practices allow 17-year-olds to enlist with
parental permission. At a time when all branches of the U.S. armed
forces are facing a shortage of personnel, their fear of losing
some high school recruits is understandable, but misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, a very small number (less than one-half of 1
percent) of U.S. troops are below age 18. The shortages won't be
eliminated by recruiting more 17-year-olds; rather, they point to
the need for comprehensive reform in the financial benefits and
career opportunities offered to the men and women of our armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
   There is some support for the new standard in other parts of the
administration, but it is a far cry from the stand the United
States should be taking on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Appropriations Authorization Act, passed by Congress
and signed into law by the president in October 1998, includes a
provision encouraging the U.S. not to block the standard, which
would be implemented through an optional protocol to the Convention
on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is that the United States remains one of only
two countries _ along with Somalia _ that has failed to ratify the
Convention, now the most widely ratified international treaty in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does this erode our credibility on international human
rights issues, it makes the United States ineligible to join the
proposed optional protocol.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.N. Commission on Human Rights meets in Geneva this
month, there is a window of opportunity for the United States to
join the international community in supporting stricter standards
on child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who pledged in 1992 that protecting human
rights would be a pillar of our nation's foreign policy, should
take the lead in building support for ratification of the
Convention and the proposed optional protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Ending the practice of recruiting 17-year-olds into the military
is a small price to pay to help keep the world's children out of
war.

   &UR; OPENING REMARKS FROM THE ``LATE SHOW with DAVID LETTERMAN'' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night down in Baltimore, the Cuban national team defeated
the Baltimore Orioles 12-to-6, p laying baseball. Castro was so
thrilled about the victory that he gave the winning pitcher for the
Cuban team a brand new 1954 Oldsmobile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro was in such a good mood after the baseball team beat
the Orioles that he sent President Clinton a box of cigars -- and
also matches in case Clinton wanted to smoke them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Jackson's on the show. Jesse Jackson is a very busy man.
Earlier today, he was down in Washington and he successfully
negotiated the release of three interns from the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Jackson is on the program, and he's here tonight to make
an announcement -- that he had absolutely nothing to do with Amy
Fisher getting out of jail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton is in Germany, and earlier today he
delivered his Eich Bein Ein Philanderer' speech.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Clinton met with the three former POWs that Jesse
Jackson got out of Yugoslavia, and they told him what it was like
to be a prisoner of war, and Clinton told them what it was like to
be married to Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an historical biography now that says that President
Abraham Lincoln might have been gay. Apparently they make a pretty
good case. I think during his time in office he was always sending
roses to a very young Strom Thurmond.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This flight attendant for British Airways...They land the
airplane and the flight attendant takes off all her clothes and
puts on one of those yellow life vests and a pilot's cap, and this
flight attendant, this woman runs around the plane because she lost
a bet. And I'm thinking about it, no, wait a minute, this sounds
more like Air Force One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you watch the Country Music Awards show last night?...The
high point of the big broadcast for me, I guess, was when New York
City Police Commissioner Howard Safir showed up at the Country
Music Awards with his date, the Dixie Chicks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're banning the sale of beer in the bleachers at Yankee
Stadium. And I'm thinking well, great, what fun is it going to the
Yankee games now if you can't get drunk and urinate on the
outfielders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you saw Noah's Ark?' I watched it. I think it's
kind of dull. Were you like me, were you rooting for the flood?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they took some liberties with the story of Noah's Ark.

   As I watched my greengrocer in Greenwich Village carefully water
the plants he has for sale, I commented that he must love them. He
demurred. He really didn't like plants at all, he said. I asked him
why he gave them such good care and he replied matter-of-factly
that it was as Plato said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the philosopher-king,'' he said, and then gave me
his version of Plato's remarks. ``The man who should be king is the
one who least wants the job because he'll do it the best,'' he
said. ``It's like that with me and the plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, I was left amazed by the city's always unexpected
combinations, this time the philosopher and the greengrocer.

   A large family of tourists stood at the corner of Fifth Avenue
and 51st Street, transfixed at the sight of four uniformed police
officers on horseback. Judith Wolfe heard this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``See children, that is how they catch criminals in New York
City,'' the mother said. ``There is too much traffic to use police
cars.''
</P>
<P>
   A moment of silence and then one of the children piped up: ``Do
they use a lasso?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   An unknown gentleman was already in the elevator of the Upper
East Side apartment building when Lois Sherr Dubin, a resident, got
on. As the two descended she noticed the man's belt buckle and
having just written a book on North American Indian jewelry, she
asked if the buckle was made by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said and proceeded to remove it to have a
look. Within moments they reached the lobby and as the doors
opened, a young woman who was waiting to enter stared as the man
casually replaced his belt. Without missing a beat, the man turned
to Ms. Dubin and said, ``Thanks very much.'' She smiled and said,
``You're welcome.'' Neither one enlightened the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Dubin is still smiling. And the belt buckle? It was a
knockoff.
</P>
<P>
   The submission by Benjamin Bederson on April 12 about the eye
chart he memorized for his Army physical in 1942 reminded me of my
father, a doctor who examined recruits in the Bronx during World
War II. He used to say he could tell how the war was going by the
instructions he received from his commander. At one point in 1944,
he said, he knew the fighting was particularly rough when this
order arrived: ``Don't examine the recruits' eyes _ just count
them.''

   It was a sizzling summer day and when my husband, Allan, and I
first set foot in the cab, we were shocked _ pleasantly. The cab
was comfortably air-conditioned and the driver had his radio tuned
to relaxing classical music.
</P>
<P>
   As tourists, we were accustomed to stressful cab rides and New
Yorkers who seemed to care only about themselves. This cabby broke
the mold _ he apparently cared about others.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be sure, I checked him out. ``Do you put on classical
music for your passengers?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   He snapped his head around, his eyes pierced mine and he said:
``Lady, this is New York. I put on classical music for myself.''

   An elderly couple came up from the Canal Street subway station
and walked west toward the Hudson, looking for a restaurant at
Watts and Washington Streets. The man had a map in hand when a
young woman passing by asked if she could help.
</P>
<P>
   She knew the restaurant, Capsouto Freres, and led the couple two
blocks to the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The man thanked her profusely and the Samaritan responded,
``That's all right _ I'll be old myself someday.'' The couple
entered the restaurant laughing.

   A woman and her young daughter were crossing the street when a
cab turned into their path. They stopped. He slammed on the brakes.
They moved forward again. So did the cab. Finally the little girl
decided to take matters into her own hands. Yolanda Crous watched
as the child stood with her legs apart and hand thrust forward and
shouted with great authority, ``Stop in the name of the law.'' And
he did.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress at the diner on West 42d Street whisked by,
dropping her menus on the table. Robert Sarnoff ordered a tea, a
coffee and an apple pie a la mode, all of which arrived quickly.
Two men and a woman in the next booth, who said they were visitors
from Michigan, were astonished by the quick service. They had been
waiting a half-hour for their cheesecake and Sprites, they said,
and it was the second time they had received such poor service at
the diner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you come back?'' Mr. Sarnoff asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be a lot thinner when I return home,'' the woman said.

   William Borden and his wife, Nancy Lee, live in Bemidji, Minn.,
but whenever they are in New York, they make what they call a
pilgrimage to Zabar's, where they stock up on items that they carry
home in a cloth tote emblazoned with the store name.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when they returned to their resort town, population
11,000, they went shopping at a local supermarket. As they emerged,
Zabar's bag filled with local groceries, a summer visitor rushed up
and asked hopefully, ``Is there a Zabar's in Bemidji?'' Hope turned
to disappointment at their answer, but the Bordens are still hoping
for a branch in northern Minnesota. Their bag is ready.  &QL;

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ She's seen too much, Meli said. She wants
a rest. She wants it to be over. She wants to leave, like her
friends, and go to Macedonia. But she wants to stay, because her
mother wants to stay, and it's her home and why should she leave
it? And it seems to be getting better, she says, in Pristina,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Meli is an ethnic Albanian, 21 years old, and she has remained
here in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, throughout the nearly seven
weeks of warfare between NATO and the Serbs, and between the Serbs
and the Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   She is funny and brave, and she is frightened all the time.
</P>
<P>
   She has seen an Albanian shot down by the police in front of her
eyes. She has seen Serbian paramilitary fighters, with uniforms and
guns and masks over their heads, ordering Albanians to leave their
homes and threatening to shoot them if they did not go.
</P>
<P>
   She has had a NATO missile land near her apartment downtown,
while she was sleeping, breaking all the windows and scaring her
half-mad. She has watched her shop looted and nearly all of her
friends depart, pushed by the Serbs and pulled by panic, to become
refugees in another country.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke two times with a reporter, in English, with no Serb
present, and in the end, still unsure about her future, asked that
only her nickname be used, and the names of her family and friends
not be used at all.
</P>
<P>
   Despite everything, she says, she feels sorry for the Serbs.
``They don't know what's happening to them,'' she said. ``They
don't know what's really happening here, and they don't know why
they're getting bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's perfectly understandable that the Serbs will defend their
country and their hold over Kosovo. ``Of course they will defend
the country,'' she said. ``That's normal for every nation. But they
also have to know why they're being bombed.''
</P>
<P>
   And why does she think the Serbs are being bombed?
</P>
<P>
   She stopped, smiled once, and said very slowly, ``Because people
are being killed here.'' How many? ``I don't know,'' she said. ``I
don't think we'll ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   But she also feels sorry as well for the insurgent fighters of
the Kosovo Liberation Army. ``They're too weak to fight the Serbs
or to protect us,'' she said. ``They overestimated their strength
and got a lot of people into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   There is tragedy enough for everyone, she says. ``I feel sorry
for the Serbs who've been bombed and died and I feel sorry for my
own people. But maybe now there will be a conclusion, a settlement
for good. That would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Meli always feared what would happen if the West intervened with
force, saying it gave a license to the Serbs to take revenge on the
majority Albanians here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect this to happen; I didn't want NATO to bomb,
but it happened,'' she said. ``I knew if they started to bomb it
would be very bad for the people here, and I was really afraid of
the paramilitaries and the crazy Serbs, because they knew just what
they wanted to do and they did it. I think it was all written
down.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first month, she stayed in her downtown apartment,
rarely going out, listening for a knock on the door that didn't
come.
</P>
<P>
   Meli's mother, brother and grandmother live in the Suncani Breg
(Sunny Hill) area of Pristina, a development of Soviet-style
apartment houses, where she was first met waiting in a long line
for bread. Meli lives with them now, too, having abandoned her
apartment. In part, it was because of the missile attack, she said,
and in part because she heard from a neighbor that soldiers were
clearing the building to live there themselves, part of their
tactics of dispersal.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Dragodan, a much wealthier Albanian area of Pristina on
an opposite hill, Suncani Breg has been largely untouched by
arsonists and looters. The Serbs rampaged through Dragodan, where
Washington put an American cultural center, now completely trashed,
with plastic American flags littering the ground. The bigger and
gaudier the house, it seemed, the bigger the fire. The streets
there are blocked with broken masonry and burned cars, and no one
seems to live in Dragodan anymore, except for a few very elderly
Albanian men.
</P>
<P>
   While many Albanians were pushed or fled from Suncani Breg, it
was largely spared the rage of the Serbs, and many Albanians still
live here who have not gone or been ordered to go.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who fled, ``maybe half left from fear, and half got
knocks on the door,'' Meli said. ``It's hard to know. People panic,
and they panic everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Meli is a small entrepreneur, with two shops, a coffee shop and
a pharmacy. One day, she said, the police came and confiscated the
entire contents of the pharmacy. Asked if they had issued her a
receipt, as they are supposed to do, for post-war payment, she
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, there was no receipt. Are you kidding? They just said
thank you and left.''
</P>
<P>
   With most of her friends gone, Meli spends a lot of her time
with three girlfriends. They play a card game called Remi and drink
a lot of tea and smoke cigarettes when they can find some. They
talk incessantly about what's happening and what may happen.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about it every day, all the time, and yet we're sick
of it,'' she said. ``We're most afraid that we'll go crazy. We ask
each other, `Are we the same as before?' And of course we tell each
other, `Yes, exactly the same.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meli and her friends have decided that despite all the death, of
Serbs as well as Albanians, Western intervention will be good if it
ends well, with a lasting settlement that provides security and
dignity for ordinary Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say America loves the Albanians; it has its
interests,'' she said. ``But having 19 countries on your side makes
me feel better. You feel that you're not alone, that almost all the
world supports you. That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she favor an independent Kosovo? ``You know, I don't care
if it's this or that,'' Meli said. ``I just want all this to end,
and to feel good again, to feel good in my place and my house with
my friends and family.''
</P>
<P>
   She stopped, imagining that odd prospect. ``You know,'' she
said, ``I don't have a house in Mexico or America somewhere _ only
here.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   She wants a settlement that brings foreigners here ``with some
force behind them.'' She is indifferent about who the foreigners
are. ``But I'll feel much better if a guy with a gun is in front of
my house protecting me,'' she said. ``I'll feel safe and won't feel
I have to see another Albanian guy shot dead in front of my
house.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meli talks a lot about getting out _ just for a week or two, to
rest and relax. She dreams of that, she said. ``I'd like to leave,
to go to Macedonia. I wouldn't go far, just stay by the border, and
come back as soon as it's over. I need a rest,'' she said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But her mother still won't leave, and her grandmother, and Meli
and her friends fear it's too late to go now, with the Macedonians
closing down the border.
</P>
<P>
   And then she says, ``But it's good here, it's OK now. I feel
good. If it continues like this I'll be happy,'' she said. ``Maybe
because it's the capital, but it's better here.''
</P>
<P>
   Will it continue like this? ``I don't know, I don't know,'' she
said rapidly, darting her eyes about. ``I'm afraid if the Serbs are
going to lose, they'll go crazy again. I'm really afraid, afraid
all the time. Everybody's afraid. Nobody knows. But I really think
it's going to be OK now.''
</P>
<P>
   Does she dream? She laughs uproariously. ``Of course, and in
color, too!'' About what? ``I dream and I think a lot, about what
I'd most like to happen here. It has to be settled. We can't go on
like this for 30 years, like the Israelis, to have 30 years of war
_ that's a really long time. To sit and talk after 30 years of war
_ I mean, come on, that's ridiculous! If they want to fight this
war until the end, it will be horrible. I want to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   She's tired all the time, she says. She's sleeping less. ``I'm
more nervous. I can't stay in one place. I like to be together with
my friends _ I don't want to be waiting alone in one place.'' For
the knock on the door? ``Yes, yes, for the knock. I'm sick of
waiting, sick of the news, but that's all we talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When all this is over,'' she says, like a threnody, and later
again, ``When this is all finished.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is all over I'm going to school to study politics,''
she says once, and laughs. ``Maybe I'll be famous one day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When this is all finished,'' she says later, ``I'm going to
take a camera and go all over Kosovo and document what has
happened. I'll be a journalist for myself, and make an album.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all over,'' she said again, still later, ``I just
want to go off for a few weeks to a beach. Somewhere there is no
bombing and no Serbs. Just go out and have some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's over,'' she said later, laughing again, ``I'm really
worried that my friends will come back and the guys will look at
us, playing cards and drinking tea, and think, `What's wrong with
them? They're crazy!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's all over,'' she said, finally, looking down into her
coffee, drawing circles with her finger on the table, ``I just want
to stop feeling afraid.''

   UNEXPLORED LANDS: It's true that explorers have reached the
world's highest mountain (Everest, 29,029 feet) and the deepest
ocean (Mariana Trench, in the Pacific, 35,797 feet). And this might
suggest that the Earth is all explored. But at the dawn of a new
millennium, it's amazing to learn that some parts of the world
still haven't been charted. In fact, there's plenty of exploring
yet to be done _ parts of Antarctica, Canada's Northwest
Territories, the Himalayas and beyond. We interview folks at
National Geographic to learn where no human has gone before.
(Includes map of unexplored places.)

   UNEXPLORED LANDS: It's true that explorers have reached the
world's highest mountain (Everest, 29,029 feet) and the deepest
ocean (Mariana Trench, in the Pacific, 35,797 feet). And this might
suggest that the Earth is all explored. But at the dawn of a new
millennium, it's amazing to learn that some parts of the world
still haven't been charted. In fact, there's plenty of exploring
yet to be done _ parts of Antarctica, Canada's Northwest
Territories, the Himalayas and beyond. We interview folks at
National Geographic to learn where no human has gone before.

   PIANO-RECORDING-HISTORY (Undated) _ Is it possible to sum up the
vast recorded legacy of the piano? One answer has begun to arrive
in recent months. Philips has been releasing the first volumes of
Great Pianists of the 20th Century, which it says is the largest
recording project ever. It may well be: so far, 60 two-CD volumes
have been released, and when all 100 volumes become available by
the end of October, they will include 15,006 minutes of music. If
that number is a little difficult to comprehend, you might do the
math this way: figuring on a 35-hour-per-week listening schedule,
which allows time off for lunch and weekends, you would need nearly
two months to hear everything. By Michael Kimmelman.

   ANDRE-DINNER-FILM (New York) _ ``My Dinner With Andre,''
directed by Louis Malle, was a surprise success in 1981 and quickly
became a cult movie favorite: a virtuosic colloquy between two old
friends, Andre Gregory and Wallace Shawn, whose wide disparities
were philosophical as well as personal. Last fall, the movie was
shown as part of an archival series of classic films at the
Hamptons International Festival, and it has just been re-released,
beginning with an exclusive engagement at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas
in Manhattan. This seemed a propitious time to bring the two
together for another conversation _ about the film, questions of
art and reality, and what has happened to them since that first
``Dinner.'' By Mel Gussow.

<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PERFORMING-SPACE-THEATER (New York) _ Performing Space 122 in
Manhattan over the years has presented more that 5,000 artists and
commissioned hundreds of new plays and dance works. Increased
financial support, critical accolades from the mainstream press,
and an audience that grew more discerning as it increased all
combined to turn P.S. 122 into what its longtime executive
director, Mark Russell, calls ``the Carnegie Hall of performance
art.'' By Steven Drukman. Photo

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARSONS-DANCE (New York) _ The Parsons Dance Company has
attracted large audiences, in locations as diverse as Brazil,
Italy, Australia and St. Louis, Mo. And its two-week engagement at
the Joyce Theater, starting Tuesday, is nearly sold out. ``Almost
all the music will be live,'' said David Parsons, 39, the
dancer-choreographer. In the troupe's lineup is Parsons newest
work, ``Fill the Woods With Light,'' which had its world premiere
at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., last summer, to a
commissioned score by the jazz composer Phil Woods, who will play
it at the Joyce with his Little Big Band. To Woods' mix of funky
rock-and-roll, blues and bossa nova, Parsons created, according to
the composer, ``a warm dance, sort of down and dirty.'' By Valerie
Gladstone. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   WOZZECK-OPERA (Undated) _ Two operas are closely linked:
``Wozzeck,'' a devastating success; ``Moses und Aron,'' a failure
of epic stature. The pupil, Alban Berg, wrote the first; the
teacher, Arnold Schoenberg, the second. Perhaps no opera since
Mozart feels as complete as ``Wozzeck.'' ``Moses und Aron'' lies
unfinished, although its first two acts were written some 20 years
before the composer's death in 1951. The words for a third act
awaited only the music for them. Both works played at the
Metropolitan Opera this season, showing us two minds going in
opposite directions. By Bernard Holland. Photo.

</P>
<P>
   TOM-ZE-BRAZIL-MUSIC (Sao Paulo, Brazil) _ In Brazil, where
leading songwriters routinely cite concepts from anthropology and
pay homage to avant-garde poets, Tom Ze, 62, comes across as a man
who's passionate about ideas. A conversation wandered from his
childhood in Irara, a poor rural town in Bahia in northeastern
Brazil, to his education in contemporary classical composition at
the University of Bahia's school of music, to his tour with the
band Tortoise (which comes to Irving Plaza in Manhattan on
Wednesday) to the Council of Trent, in the mid-16th century. By Jon
Pareles. Photo.

   TIBETAN-ART (New York) _ The art exhibition ``Worlds of
Transformation: Tibetan Art of Wisdom and Compassion,'' is now
showing at Tibet House in Manhattan. Many of the art works suggest
ways to tame the violence in the human mind. By Kay Larson.
</P>
<P>
   ENCAUSTIC-ART (Undated) _ Leave it to modern artists to find
intriguing beauty _ and expressive power _ in the gooey textures of
waxy buildup. New materials and techniques have always attracted
the avant-garde, but paradoxically, during certain periods in the
20th century, an ancient method of image making seized the
imagination of many experimental artists. The results of some of
those experiments are on view from Sunday through Aug. 15 at the
Montclair Art Museum in Montclair, N.J., where ``Waxing Poetic:
Encaustic Art in America'' examines its theme in more than 70 works
by modern and contemporary artists, including Arthur Dove, Jasper
Johns, Lynda Benglis and Michelle Stuart. By Edward M. Gomez.

<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-DARIA (Undated) _ Daria the character made her debut on MTV's
less verbal animated series ``Beavis and Butt-head'' in 1994.
``Daria'' the show had its premiere in March 1997, when the title
character transferred to a new school. ``I like to think that I've
helped her come out of her shell,'' says Glenn Eichler, who created
the original character and is co-creator, with Susie Lewis Lynn, of
the series. The secret of Daria's popularity (everywhere but in her
own home and school) may be our collective alienation. By Anita
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   TV-CHEADLE (Los Angeles) _ Don Cheadle, who won a Golden Globe
Award for his betrayal of Sammy Davis Jr., in the HBO movie ``The
Rat Pack,'' will play Grant Wiggins in HBO's ``Lesson Before
Dying'' (Saturday at 8 p.m.), based on the 1993 novel by Ernest J.
Gaines. Here Cheadle is a proud and snobbish man eager to break out
of a dirt-poor black community in the South of the 1940s, where he
teaches shoeless children in overalls. By James Sterngold.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   INDIAN-BOOKS-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Frank T. Siebert's American
Indians book collection will be auctioned in two parts at Sotheby's
in Manhattan, in a sale estimated to total about $7 million. The
first 550 books, which focus on the tribes east of the Mississippi,
will go on view Sunday and be offered for sale on Friday; they are
expected to bring as much as $3.4 million. The rest of the books,
on those of the South and the West, will be auctioned in October.

VIETNAM PUTS ITS FILM RECORD OF THE WAR ON THE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ The black-and-white images are often blurry and rough,
like very old home movies.
</P>
<P>
   One sequence begins with the camera peering through jungle
foliage in South Vietnam. A U.S. soldier, unaware he is being
watched, briefly pops his head out of a foxhole. Another lays
sandbags nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The camera then cuts to a small band of Vietcong guerrillas as
they circle the camp and then attack. After a few chaotic moments
of running and shooting, they take the soldier out of the foxhole
with his hands high. Another American, under fire, tries to drag a
wounded buddy to safety but then runs for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Other scenes show guerrillas planting bombs beneath a bridge and
blowing up a U.S. truck convoy; Communist soldiers sifting through
U.S. warplane wrecks to find identification, family photos and even
Kodak cameras, and workers lugging ammunition along the Ho Chi Minh
trail.
</P>
<P>
   All of these are scenes from the other side of the world's first
``television war.'' They are part of the Vietnamese government's
huge archive of war film from 1960s and 1970s, much of it produced
by Vietcong photographers who lived for years in jungles not far
from Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for the first time, the films are going on the market.
In an unusual post-Cold War deal, the Vietnamese government has
teamed with a German company to market broadcasting and movie
rights to foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of hours of film are available, and Vietnam is eager
to strike deals with American and European documentary producers.
The Discovery Channel, the History Channel and WGBH, Boston's
public television station, have all taken a look at a short
selection of material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We produced many documentaries about the war, while were
fighting against the French and then later against the Americans,''
said Luu Trong Hong, general director of the Vietnam Cinema
Department in Hanoi. ``These films were seen in Vietnam or other
socialist countries, but they were in the other states only very
rarely.''
</P>
<P>
   The licensing effort grew out of a casual conversation in Hanoi
two years ago between a former Vietcong cameraman and an executive
at the company that used to produce East Germany's propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The cameraman was Nyuyen Van Nhiem, who filmed alongside
guerrillas in South Vietnam from 1970 to 1976 and who now serves as
an occasional translator for German visitors. The German was
Alexander van Duelman, an executive at Progress Film-Verleih GmbH
in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Based in a crumbling old building on the east side of Berlin,
Progress is the successor company to East Germany's
government-owned media monopoly, known as DEFA. Before the Berlin
Wall fell in 1989, DEFA produced virtually all of East Germany's
television programs and movies. Its output ranged from children's
cartoons to Wild West shoot-em-ups (``Native Americans as They
Really Were!'' according to one brochure) and outright propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Progress ekes out a small business by marketing DEFA's
old movies and programs, mostly as historical material, but partly
as entertainment. Last year its sales totaled about 1.4 million
marks, or $750,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a very strong link between East Germany and
Vietnam,'' said van Duelmen, 31, who is from the former West
Germany and is head of international sales for Progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that East German was one of their most important
allies during the war,'' he said. ``More than two million
Vietnamese worked and studied here, and about 57,000 still live
here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Duelmen was in Hanoi in 1997, trying to market a German
movie, when Nhiem urged him to look at some of his old film. A wiry
and ebullient man, now 43 years old, Nhiem filmed alongside Viet
Cong guerrillas in South Vietnam from 1970 to 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot imagine what it was like,'' Nhiem said on a visit
to Berlin. ``There wasn't one square meter that wasn't exposed to
bombing. You couldn't think about life or death in that situation,
just the pictures. If you had had fear, you would never have
survived.''
</P>
<P>
   During most of his years in the jungle, Nhiem used a 16-mm
Bell&AMP;Howell camera and American film that he bought from smugglers
in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   Van Duelman was immediately intrigued, and soon began
discussions with government officials about marketing the entire
archive. The two sides reached a deal in Hanoi in January, and
Progress has reviewed and sorted about one-fifth of the film so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Western companies can negotiate with Progress
for rights to sift through everything and then use it in their own
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Van Dulmen refused to suggest how much money he expects Western
companies to pay. He said his first goal is to sign deals with one
significant documentary producer in Europe and one in the United
States. After giving those producers a head-start of a year or two,
he plans to seek out other licensees.
</P>
<P>
   The European producer will probably be Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk,
Germany's new public television network, which produces programming
for eastern Germany. Several U.S. companies have looked at the
short selection of the film but none have made offers yet.
</P>
<P>
   WGBH, which produces the ``American Experience'' series on
public television, has expressed interest. So has Discovery
Communications, owner of the Discovery Channel, and the History
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, the images are likely to be engrossing _
particularly to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The short reel of selections was drawn from government
documentaries, so it includes patriotic music and the voices of
official newscasters. But the film is nonetheless authentic and
haunting.
</P>
<P>
   One segment shows women feverishly lugging stones to repair
bombed-out bridges along the Ho Chi Minh trail, then running for
cover as a U.S. warplane flies in for another bombing run. The film
shows several B-52s brought down by mortar fire, as well as the
charred corpse of a pilot and photos of his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   Another sequence shows people being bombed at night, with
phosphorus bombs lighting up the sky so pilots could spot their
targets.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to prove that they had indeed destroyed U.S. planes and
tanks, the combat photographers recorded much personal memorabilia.
They zoomed in close enough to read the names on ID cards or to
clearly see snapshot photos of children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The film also includes numerous images of Vietnamese, including
small children, whose bodies are covered with burns from napalm.
</P>
<P>
   For American producers, the most difficult question about the
film is whether the Vietnamese government will give foreigners
editorial freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Though government officials say they are willing to let foreign
producers pore over their entire archive, they also insist on
blocking ``anti-Vietnam'' films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't expect people to produce Vietnam propaganda, but we
don't want them to falsify Vietnam or the Vietnamese Communist
Party,'' said Hong, head of the government's film agency. ``We want
people to use these selections in the pursuit of truth.'' Hong left
no doubt that he expects to know and approve of the basic idea of a
documentary before handing over rights.
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, Hong said the government would be willing to
let people use images of the infamous traps that would send bamboo
spikes straight through a soldier's body. The traps have often been
depicted as the epitome of Viet Cong ruthlessness, and government
officials are sensitive about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying that if you show pictures of bamboo traps, then
you should explain why they were used,'' Hong said.

 &HT;    Pistons try to deal with Mutombo
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ Dikembe Mutombo stands as an almost
unwitting symbol of the Hawks' domination over the Detroit Pistons
past, present and for the long-range future.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 45 points and grabbing 32 rebounds in the first
two games of their best-of-five series, Mutombo is literally cause
and effect. Three years ago, as a free agent, he declined to play
in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with one more burst of energy tonight at the Palace, the
Hawks are in position to sweep the sagging Pistons out of the
playoffs after only three games.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hawks' prospects appear brighter for the next few
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the present, Mutombo sat calmly after practice
Tuesday and spoke of his commitment to finishing off the Pistons.
``The prison is full,'' he said. ``We can take no more prisoners,
so now we must shoot the prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   No question the Pistons are badly wounded. Because coach Alvin
Gentry considers Steve Smith the best shooting guard in the NBA, he
will not leave him open to double-team Mutombo. If the Pistons do
not double Mutombo, they pay the price that was exacted Monday
night. Thirteen of his 14 shots went in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they will do that again,'' Mutombo said. ``I
can't count on it, but whatever they want, it's OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   A rout in this series would further a trend that started in 1996
when Hawks general manager Pete Babcock made a chump out of his pal
Rick Sund, the Pistons GM who had been fired previously by Dallas
during that franchise's dark decline.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, the Pistons went after Mutombo and were told he
would not play for them. The Hawks were able to sign Mutombo to a
five-year, $55 million free agent's contract because the Pistons
agreed to help them by taking Grant Long and Stacey Augmon, along
with their contracts.
</P>
<P>
   That allowed the Hawks to clear salary-cap room for Mutombo. The
Hawks got two first-round picks in exchange _ one through
Sacramento, the other Detroit's.They are cashing in those picks in
next month's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mutombo led the Hawks to a 3-2 first-round series
victory over the Pistons, scoring 26 in one game. The Pistons went
out and signed Bison Dele as a counter-move.
</P>
<P>
   Worse for the Pistons, neither Augmon nor Long worked out. They
shipped Augmon to Portland for the Blazers' 1999 first-rounder.
After Doug Collins resigned as coach, Long went to Gentry, then the
interim coach, to talk about his diminished role on the team.
Gentry said Long did not figure in the team's plans. After Detroit
exercised a clause that allowed them to pay Long on the cheap for
the 1998-99 season, he exercised his right to become a free agent.
He has played a pivotal role as a Hawks emergency starter in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, the Pistons needed big men. They signed free
agent Loy Vaught after he recovered from back surgery. They also
wanted Christian Laettner and proposed a sign-and-trade deal with
the Hawks. In return, the Hawks got the only other first-round pick
Detroit had this season, the one they had gotten for Augmon, plus a
$4.4 million salary-cap trade exception.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Hawks hold the upper hand now. They can stumble twice in
this series and still knock out the Pistons in a fifth game at
home.
</P>
<P>
   And they have a chance to be even more dominant over the next
several years, while the Pistons try to figure a way to counter
with $65 million worth of commitments to Laettner, Vaught and Dele
_ all brought on board the last two years because they couldn't get
the big guy himself.

   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. _ There is some hopeful news on the Hawks'
injury front. Chris Crawford might be able to play tonight and
would be likely for a Game 4 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks trainer Chris Tucker said Tuesday that the second-year
starting forward has a first-degree shoulder separation, which he
likened to a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, who fell three minutes into Monday's game, underwent
two rehab sessions Tuesday and is scheduled for another session
this morning. If he has sufficient range of motion, he will take a
flight here for tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker ruled out strapping Crawford's shoulder with a device.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do that with some guys, but Chris' game is above the
rim,'' he said. ``He plays with his arms extended. If we strap him
up, he can't do that. We're better off allowing him to fully
heal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks also decided that Alan Henderson will make the trip,
but it was questionable whether his vision problems would ease.
Henderson watched Monday's game from the bench wearing an eyepatch
after struggling for four minutes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are down to 10 healthy players and their front court
is thin. With Grant Long and Ty Corbin in the lineup, backup center
Mark West and small forward Roshown McLeod are the only healthy big
men on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded house
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for a possible Game 5 Sunday at Georgia Tech go on sale
at noon today at Ticketmaster and the Georgia Dome box office. The
Dome is unavailable because it cannot be converted from a concert
set-up Saturday night in time for a Sunday afternoon tip-off to
accommodate NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Seats will be at a premium because capacity at Tech is 9,300.
The first two games at the Dome drew 20,884 and 16,377.
</P>
<P>
   Tired? Corbin says no
</P>
<P>
   Worried about fatigue at age 36?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not,'' Corbin said after going 41 minutes off the
bench Monday. Tuesday morning, Corbin said his legs are full of
life and he's ready for another long stint on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fresh coming into the series, and, as long as I got my
day off, I'm fine,'' Corbin said.
</P>
<P>
   As the man primarily responsible for containing Grant Hill, he
is under constant pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, we help a lot (on defense), so I don't have to
try and hold him all by myself,'' Corbin said. ``Grant Long takes
him sometimes; the guards come over and help out. It's the team's
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Corbin said the Hawks can work Hill until the Pistons guards
prove they can sink long open shots consistently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get it going, we'll have to make some adjustments.By
the numbers
</P>
<P>
   If there is a Game 4, it will be at 7 p.m. Friday on TBS. ...
The Hawks haven't swept a series since they knocked out Houston in
two games in 1979. The first round was best-of-three then. ... The
Pistons' total of 139 points is the second-worst two-game offensive
display in playoff history during the shot-clock era. Utah combined
for 136 points in Games 3 and 4 of the first round against Houston
last season.

 &HT;    NBA will lose 'ultimate professional' in Dumars
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN, HILLS, Mich. _ He was the good guy on the Bad Boys. None
of the talk of overly physical and borderline-dirty play about the
dominant Detroit Pistons in the late 1980s applied to Joe Dumars.
He was above it all, a beacon of decency and pride.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the Pistons one defeat away from extinction, one
of the league's most respected players readies for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The event won't be marked by an hourlong special on ESPN, as
happened for Michael Jordan, John Elway and Wayne Gretzky. But the
loss of Dumars, 36, is significant for the NBA, for the class and
character he exhibited over 14 years are often lacking in today's
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the ultimate professional, the ultimate performer,''
said Maurice Cheeks, former NBA point guard and current 76ers
assistant coach. ``There aren't enough words to describe him. To
me, he's in a class with Julius Erving. I would think Grant Hill
came into the league looking at Joe the way I looked at Doc when I
was playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill learned how to comport himself as a pro from Dumars. At
most every opportunity, the veteran shooting guard would lend the
young forward the knowledge he attained over a career marked by
championships in 1989 and 1990 and six All-Star Games. Dumars
understood from the start what many high-paid, high-profile
athletes never get: It takes more energy to be a jerk than to be a
nice guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one person who's influenced me the most since I
came to the NBA, it's been Joe,'' Hill said. ``He's just a great
person, a great player, a great pro. I was lucky to come to a team
with someone like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The path to the Hall of Fame is not a clear one for Dumars. His
career average of 16.1 points is not mind-blowing, but his
contributions as an all-around player and clutch performer over the
years cannot be ignored. In his prime, he was the best defensively
at his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was tough and smart and committed,'' said Isiah Thomas,
Dumars' former backcourt mate. ``When we stepped on the basketball
court, Joe Dumars was one player I did not have to worry about. He
came to play every night, no exceptions. You couldn't ask for a
better teammate.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit got the better of the Chicago Bulls back then because
Dumars was attached to Michael Jordan like Velcro. Their battles
were physical and classic. The impression Dumars left on Jordan was
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never talked to each other,'' Jordan said. ``We just both
played the game hard and with respect for the game and each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Dumars has taken an interest in Allen Iverson. He has
spoken to the 76ers young gun about the virtues of being
professional. Coincidence or not, Iverson has come off recently
less of a Generation X, selfish player.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people only see the negative,'' Iverson said, ``but
this was about a veteran player giving his advice on what to weed
out, what to take in. It means something coming from him. Why do
you think he's been so successful for so long? It's not just
because he's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Hawks complete the sweep tonight, Dumars will take off
his Pistons uniform for the last time. While he's ready to take on
a new life, he does not want to go out on a broom.
</P>
<P>
   The playoffs are ``very important to me, but it can't be just
important to me,'' he said. ``It has to be important to everybody
here. We have some guys for whom this is the first time in the
playoffs, and you have me on the other end of the spectrum. There
are guys here who have just as much motivation as I do, but for
different reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Dumars never played the role of self-absorbed player. During the
height of his career, he took courses in investment banking. He
established an annual charity tennis tournament for Detroit
children's hospital. He opened the Joe Dumars Recreational Center
for area kids. And he did normal things that most players would
never do, like attending a sportswriter's wedding, with gift in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt celebrity status automatically makes you a
role model,'' Dumars said. ``It's personal values, morals and
ethics. Not money and status. If it were that, then my parents
never would have been role models. For so many years, you try to
establish yourself as a player and a person, trying to be accepted
in the community. I'm at peace with myself as a player and a
person.''

 &HT;    ISC, Penske pact strengthens hold on racing world
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Speedway operators International Speedway Corp. and
Penske Motorsports have reached a $610 million merger agreement
that will bolster their already influential power in stock-car
racing.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement that should be completed later this year, the
new company, which will keep the ISC name, will control nine tracks
that host 14 of 34 events on this year's NASCAR Winston Cup
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ISC owns speedways in Daytona Beach, Fla.; Darlington, S.C.;
Phoenix; Talladega, Ala.; and Watkins Glen, N.Y. Under the merger,
ISC acquires Penske's tracks in Fontana, Calif.; Brooklyn, Mich.;
and Rockingham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The merging companies already co-owned a new speedway in
Homestead, Fla., and Penske also owned a track in Nazareth, Pa.,
which hosts Busch Grand National and other motorsports events.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR president Bill France Jr. will remain chairman and chief
executive officer of ISC, with Roger Penske serving as vice
chairman. ISC and Penske Motorsports had a combined $306 million in
revenues and $92 million in income in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, ISC could own more than half of the tracks hosting
Winston Cup races. The sport's other track-operating giant,
Charlotte-based Speedway Motorsports Inc., owns six speedways,
including those in Atlanta; Concord, N.C.; Las Vegas; and Fort
Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The merger was reached just a few months after NASCAR announced
it was taking television negotiating rights from speedway
operators. With the merger, which gives the new company a combined
800,000 seats and 400 luxury suites, ISC should have more leverage
in future scheduling. ISC also stands to take a large share of
television revenues when NASCAR agrees to a new network contract.
In addition to the 10 tracks already in place, the merged company
also is involved in planning or constructing new tracks near
Chicago, Denver, Kansas City and New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, ISC will acquire 88 percent, or 12.2
million outstanding common shares, of Penske Motorsports stock it
does not already own at $50 per share.

 &HT;    SENATE OPENS DEBATE ON VIOLENCE AND KIDS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (a) general news categories
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Senators from both parties scrambled Tuesday to
respond to the school shootings in Littleton, Colo., by offering a
flurry of anti-violence amendments to a bipartisan juvenile justice
bill.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican task force on violence and youth crime headed by
Sen. Wayne Allard, R-Colo., endorsed 15 amendments as the debate
began. Democratic leaders endorsed another eight.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP proposals included five to enhance the safety of
schools, four to discourage violent entertainment and four to
strengthen gun control laws. One would fund more enforcement of
existing gun control laws, and another would permit a monument with
religious prayer or symbols on public school grounds, if the
monument commemorates someone slain on that property.
</P>
<P>
   The eight Democratic amendments had a total of 11 provisions,
all of which would strengthen gun control laws.
</P>
<P>
   The debate on those amendments, and several others offered
without either party's endorsement, will extend through Thursday or
Friday, Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one proposal is sure to pass, because it was endorsed by
both parties. It would expand the existing ban on sales of handguns
to juveniles to include semi-automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As many as half of the other amendments may be approved, because
many senators want to show they share their constituents' concern
over the safety of schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., a former state attorney general,
commented, ``There are very good ideas on both the Republican and
Democratic sides to improve this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., an ex-policeman
and ex-teacher, sounded a more skeptical note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly (the amendments) are all little pieces of some bigger
picture,'' Campbell said. ``But I know some people are saying all
we have to do is make changes to control guns...and others are
saying it's all Hollywood's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The juvenile justice bill is co-sponsored by Judiciary Committee
Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and the panel's ranking Democrat,
Joseph Biden of Delaware. It would authorize $1 billion a year for
five years in federal aid for juvenile justice programs of states
and localities.
</P>
<P>
   The bill splits the money fairly evenly between prevention
programs and punishment programs, funds better exchanges of
juvenile felony records between states, and places a lifetime ban
on gun purchases by any juvenile convicted of a violent felony.
</P>
<P>
   Several senators asked for restraint during this week's debate,
which comes on the heels of a wave of rumors and false bomb threats
that have emptied classrooms temporarily in several states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that everybody engaged in this debate would be
mindful that we not do anything that creates more anxiety among our
youngsters,'' cautioned Senate Republican Conference chairman Paul
Coverdell of Georgia, as he unveiled the 15 GOP proposals at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, there are 50 million students in 118,000 schools,
and, traditionally, that environment is the safest for children
except their own homes,'' Coverdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., who is about as liberal as
Coverdell is conservative, issued a similar warning against
rhetorical grandstanding on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been very careful in talking about Littleton not to
make any correlation between it and any agenda item I am for,''
Wellstone said. ``Some events are so dark, so evil, that they
cannot be flippantly explained.''

 &HT;    Georgia representative shares best website honors
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) has the top-ranked House Web
site, according to an American University survey of congressional
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's Internet address provides brief summaries of issues of
importance to 7th District residents, explanations of legislation
he has sponsored and links to dozens of other sites, including
major media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will never be a substitute for face to face meetings and
town hall discussions, but the Internet can play a valuable role in
enhancing those efforts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr shared first place among House members with Democrat Earl
Blumenauer of Oregon and Republican Brian Bilbray of California.
Republican Sen. Spencer Abraham of Michigan has the best Senate
site, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Barr was the only Georgian in the top 10 in the House or Senate.
Every Georgian in Congress, except Rep. Johnny Isakson, has a Web
site. Isakson aides have said that the office that runs the House
Internet services has been slow in posting Isakson's home page.
</P>
<P>
   American University faculty and researchers who evaluated the
493 House and Senate member sites looked at content, constituent
service, visual appeal, user friendliness and use of technology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the overall leader, Barr topped the list in
the content rankings. Accused by Democrats of being inattentive to
his district, Barr placed third in the category of constituent
service provided on the Web.

 &HT;    President to business leaders: Share economic strength
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Bill Clinton appealed to the nation's
business leaders on Tuesday to invest in those rural and urban
communities that have been left behind by the recent economic boom.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, at a White House appearance before departing to
Atlanta, also called on Congress to enact his proposals for tax
credits and loans for companies that put up venture capital for
businesses in economically distressed communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should not be a partisan political issue,'' Clinton said.
``We want to provide the economic incentives necessary to create
jobs, keep growth going in America, keep inflation low, and go into
that new century with everyone _ everyone _ walking hand in hand,
together.''
</P>
<P>
   To bring more public focus to the problems of the nation's
distressed communities, Clinton said he planned to spend two or
three days in July visiting cities and towns in ``our most stubborn
pockets of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said 37 U.S. cities still have unemployment rates that
are twice the national average, despite the largest peace-time
expansion since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of smaller communities where children still
have to go past abandoned storefronts to get to a grocery store to
buy a carton of milk,'' Clinton said. ``We don't have to leave
anyone behind. And if we can't do this now, when in the wide world
will we ever get around to it?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined at the White House by more than two-dozen
corporate CEOs, including BellSouth's F. Duane Ackerman, Delta
Airlines' Leo Mullin and AFLAC's Daniel P. Amos.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the business leaders met to discuss the economic
problems facing rural and urban America for about 90 minutes before
flying to Atlanta aboard Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   Amos, whose Columbus-based company is involved in helping former
welfare recipients learn job skills for work, said the session
helped him focus attention on potential markets in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially at our company, we spend so much time thinking
internationally,'' Amos said. ``We all of the sudden focused within
our own country ... It brought all of us back to a point where we
were considering the things that made our country great.''

cannot be flippantly explained.''

VIDEO GAMES REACHING NEW LEVEL OF ENTERTAINMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Feeling a little playful this week? It might be
that spring weather. But it also might be the tens of thousands of
game-playing freaks _ OK, computer and videogame designers,
developers, publishers, retailers and others _ descending on our
fair burg for the first time in three years, for the Electronic
Entertainment Expo.
</P>
<P>
   E3, as the massive trade show is known, is devoted to the
computer and videogame industry and runs Thursday through Saturday
at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The show's participants are arriving in town to show off the
latest technology and coolest games, previewing much of what should
dominate this Christmas season, and to celebrate an industry
growing so fast it soon will outstrip the movie business's domestic
box office.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an estimated $6.3 billion in video and electronic
games were sold, just a few hundred million dollars behind what the
movies earned at theaters (though the rental business about doubles
Hollywood's movie take).
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, the differences between games and movies are
shrinking, as studios option games to make movies, and game
publishers license movies to create new titles, and technology
allows everyone to go digital and interactive and cinematic.
</P>
<P>
   Given the boom times, E3 promises to be a major spectacle as it
returns to Los Angeles after a two-year stint in Atlanta's
commodious but inconvenient convention center.
</P>
<P>
   With Los Angeles' meeting space whipped into shape, and a huge
proportion of the gaming business and the rest of the converging
entertainment industry headquartered somewhere along the West
Coast, it was time to come back to L.A., said Doug Lowenstein,
president of the Interactive Digital Software Association.
</P>
<P>
   The result is, to borrow from Ed Sullivan, a really big show.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that some portion of the convention center is
going unused by the 410 companies with E3 booths _ in some cases,
they might better be described as E3 estates _ but it's unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In all, more than 543,000 square feet of space will be used, and
perhaps 50,000 people will attend the show, which is closed to the
public, said Lowenstein. Sony alone will have a 40,000-square-foot
booth, with hundreds of employees, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And the stars of this really big show?
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the busty hostesses, fake-fur-clad mascots, gimmicky
giveaways and overwrought displays, it'll likely be Dreamcast, the
next-generation gaming console from Sega.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast _ released last winter in Japan and debuting here
in September _ is the first console to use 128-bit computer chips
to generate increasingly realistic graphics.
</P>
<P>
   That means at least double the power of the 64-bit Nintendo 64
and Sega Saturn, and far more than the 32-bit Sony PlayStation.
After the Saturn's failure to excite the market, Sega is betting
big on the Dreamcast to revive its gaming fortunes, spending an
estimated $500 million worldwide to market the machine this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dreamcast has a lot to offer. It will seem a lot more
like a computer than a game box, coming as it does with a built-in
modem, 3-D graphics accelerator, connections for printers or
keyboards and a Windows CE operating system courtesy of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference? Its specialized brain and high-powered
graphics chips allow it to run games at four times the rate of a
Pentium II computer. That's the virtue of being a box designed for
the peculiar, graphics-heavy demands of games, instead of a
generalist machine that needs to handle a variety of tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one just has that much more power, certainly more than
any current PC,'' said Gregory Fischbach, CEO and president of
Acclaim, one of the biggest console gamemakers, with two titles
being created now for Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   Given that power, demonstrations of the new console's first
titles have been quite alluring to jaded old gamers.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic Adventure, featuring Sega's blue hedgehog mascot, is so
fluid that it's almost !ital!too!off! fast.
</P>
<P>
   A football title, NFL 2000, shows facial expressions and the
breath steaming off players during late-season games in northern
cities.
</P>
<P>
   And Shenmue, a soon-to-be-released action adventure, looks
stunningly cinematic, with protagonists and backgrounds that veer
ever more unnervingly toward looking real.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought only the PC could do this, and it's not true,''
said Jennifer Pahlka, director of the Game Developers Conference,
where the Dreamcast and its competitors recently were shown off.
``There's going to be a whole bunch of platforms coming out to
challenge the PC.''
</P>
<P>
   Those other platforms include Nintendo, which is expected to
announce its own next-generation machine soon, with a rollout
probably in 2001, said Christian Svensson, editor in chief of MCV,
a trade publication specializing in gaming.
</P>
<P>
   For E3, however, expect Nintendo to show off its new ``Star
Wars'' title _ which allows a player to take part in the
``Ben-Hur''-like rocket pod races that provide a climactic scene in
the movie _ and other games that should keep the money flowing in.
</P>
<P>
   Another competitor is VM Labs, whose Nuon graphics chip gives
gaming capabilities to regular electronics devices such as DVD
players and cable set-top boxes, without adding more than a few
dollars to the cost. It's designed to create a new outlet for
electronics owners who want to occasionally play games, Svensson
said.
</P>
<P>
   But looming over everything is Sony, whose PlayStation is the
most successful gaming console ever made, with one in 19 million
American households, nearly a fifth of the U.S. population. That
massive market has led game developers to create nearly 600 titles
for the platform, far more than any competitor.
</P>
<P>
   But Sega isn't worried about Sony's current success, which it
would like to emulate. Its much bigger concern, despite the
Dreamcast's impressive-looking technology and the PlayStation's
aging innards, is another 128-bit machine that won't even be shown
publicly at E3, Sony's PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very impressed,'' said Pahlka, who saw an early version
of the PlayStation 2 at the Game Developers Conference. ``I think
the crowd was very impressed. There was a real sense in the room of
this being an impressive machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the PlayStation 2 buzz, however, Sony officials said
they'll spend this E3 on the machine they already have on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focused on the current PlayStation, and the wealth of
new software we'll be coming out with,'' said Kazuo Hirai,
president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the company will be showing off nearly three dozen
titles coming from it and corporate sibling 989 Studios, including
sequels to proven hits such as Spyro the Dragon, Crash Bandicoot
and Gran Turismo, and a possible new contender, Ape Escape, Hirai
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for this year, the PlayStation 2 won't be shown, they won't
be talking about it,'' Svensson said. ``To be honest, it'll
probably only be shown to developers they're trying to court. They
probably won't even show it to press or analysts. Their emphasis is
undercover this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirai said the PlayStation 2 will hit the Japanese market next
spring, and arrive in the United States the following fall, but
acknowledged that's an ``aggressive'' schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers said it's not just aggressive, but unlikely,
given the technical and manufacturing challenges involved in making
the machine's extraordinary new ``Emotion Engine'' brain and other
components, and getting games written that can take advantage of
those components.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's basically too many things that can go wrong for them
to even hit March'' for a public rollout, Svensson said. ``I don't
believe they'll even be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The new machine has mind-boggling technical specifications, far
outstripping the Dreamcast and even Pentium III computers in its
graphics power, while running DVDs instead of the modified CD
``gigaroms'' used by Dreamcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, it was doing some things well beyond what I've
seen any box do,'' Svensson said. ``It was just amazing. The
PlayStation 2 is going to change our industry from the business
side, the technology side, and possibly the cultural side.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Dreamcast has a serial port to connect with some
add-on components, the PlayStation 2 is supposed to use all the
latest computer connections: Firewire, PCMCIA and USB. Those will
tie the PlayStation 2 to everything from VCRs to digital cameras to
cable set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the Dreamcast, which makes a radical break from its
failed predecessor, the PlayStation 2 will run all the games
written for the first PlayStation, giving both game buyers and game
makers a huge reason to stay with Sony for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a huge bonus from a market perspective for it
being backward compatible,'' Pahlka said. ``There's always risks
because developers invest a lot to publish on a new platform, so if
you guess wrong, you can really be hurt. And (game buyers are) not
going to be inhibited from getting a great new game because you
know you can play it on the new PlayStation 2 when it comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent market survey by Fairfield Research projected that as
many as 21 million next-generation console machines will be sold by
the Big Three manufacturers, with the most interest in the
PlayStation 2.
</P>
<P>
   But Sega officials have said they aren't too worried. Two major
electronic gaming chains have 30,000 preorders for the machine, and
a $100 million U.S. advertising push has only just begun with a
clever, somewhat anonymous teaser ad on the back cover of a
videogaming magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sega also is betting on having as many as 100 games from its own
developers and others by the time a PlayStation 2 hits U.S. markets
for Christmas 2000, enough to give game players an alternative with
lots of options, especially if the PlayStation 2 is delayed getting
to store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Sony isn't the technology star in this year's E3,
count on the company's ascendance next year, and possibly for a
long time after, Pahlka and Svensson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that sees gaming as the dominant
entertainment form of the next century,'' said Pahlka. ``They see
games growing at a massive rate, while movies really aren't growing
except for raising ticket prices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting my money on Sony,'' said Svensson. ``It's going to
be a lot harder for them to slip than it will be for others to move
ahead.''

BUSH HAS DOUBTS ABOUT FATE OF HIS SCHOOL VOUCHER PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush expressed some doubt Tuesday
that lawmakers would approve a school voucher program this session,
but he was optimistic that other key parts of his legislative
agenda would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called for the passage of a school voucher pilot program at
the beginning of the legislative session, and the proposal is
strongly supported by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But with fewer than three weeks to go in the session, Senate
Democrats said they had the votes to keep the bill from being heard
on the floor. The House has not yet approved a voucher plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think there's still a chance that vouchers may have
some life in the Senate ... but I'm not nearly as hopeful about
that particular issue as I would have been at the beginning of the
session,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The program would provide vouchers to parents of children in
poorly performing public schools. The vouchers could be used to
help pay tuition in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the last day for the House to consider all bills on
third and final reading, but proponents say there may still be an
attempt to approve a limited voucher program. The legislative
session ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Although voucher proponents have lobbied hard for the proposal,
Bush said, opponents have been successful in presenting their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are afraid that vouchers will hurt public
schools. I disagree,'' he said. ``I think vouchers will help
parents whose children get locked into failed schools. But the
opponents to vouchers have done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting Children First, an organization that favors vouchers, is
still hopes for passage of some type of proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over until it's over,'' said Chuck McDonald, a
spokesman for the group. ``Obviously, it would take some doing to
pass voucher legislation at this point. ... but there's always a
chance. It's still possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush was more optimistic that lawmakers would deliver
a school property tax cut he could support, even though the Senate
version calls for half the $2 billion in tax relief he is seeking
and the House hasn't even approved a tax-reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're in good shape. I think we're going to have
both a teacher pay raise and tax cuts that will be substantial,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is considering a bid for the Republican presidential
nomination, and some political observers believe he wants to emerge
from the session with a sizable tax cut that he can tout on the
campaign trail. But the governor insisted he is only concerned
about Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what's important to Texas that matters to me. We'll worry
about all the (presidential) exploratory business later. Right now,
it's what's best for Texas,'' said Bush, who is expected to travel
to Iowa and New Hampshire next month after the legislative session
ends.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Six days before the Israeli elections, Chaim
Yisrael, an elderly Hasidic Jew, hurried to complete his shopping
near the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim. He was on his
way to tutor Torah, he said, but he could spare a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there's only one real leader for us,'' he said,
raising his bearded chin, peering heavenward over the brim of his
black hat, and pointing at the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Yisrael said, he is planning to go to the polls,
and to cast a half-hearted vote for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the personal side, he looks a little like Clinton
morally,'' Yisrael said. ``But ideologically, he's fine. What
choice do we have really? Politics is the land of relativity, and
he will be better to protect the land of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight miles away and a world apart, Moussa Ibrahim was equally
equivocal. Standing over a mountain of salty pumpkin seeds in his
gourmet shop in Abu Ghosh, an Israeli-Arab village, he expressed
deep cynicism about the possibility for change. But he said he will
vote for Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not because I am a big fan,'' he said. ``But because I want to
be able to go out in the street and say I have a prime minister who
is not a paranoid, a cheater, and a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   In an election campaign that is reputedly a personality
competition, devoid of real debate on the issues, few Israelis seem
inspired by the candidates themselves. From the craggy hills of the
West Bank to the sleepy desert town of Beersheba, from affluent Tel
Aviv to depressed Netivot, few Israelis offer rhapsodic
endorsements of their candidate. Many say they will effectively
cast their ballot while holding their nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``People vote by way of elimination here,'' said Vered
Alexandrovitz of north Tel Aviv, a bookstore owner.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis tend to be skeptical of predictions. They do not trust
the polls, which show Barak ahead of Netanyahu by about eight
percentage points in a five-way race. A tour of the southern half
of Israel, including conversations with scores of voters, instead
leaves the impression that Netanyahu and Barak are in a dead heat
in a race that will go down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the country does not seem gripped by the intensity of a
tight election battle. Balconies are only spottily strung with
political banners, and road junctions are not routinely staffed by
campaign workers. There have been no big political rallies, partly
for security reasons, and no political debates between Netanyahu,
whose nickname is Bibi, and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the country, many Israelis said they consider
Netanyahu and Barak to be cut from the same cloth: both
self-confident Ashkenazi Jews with master's degrees from the United
States, both former members of the military elite, and both leaning
toward the center _ Netanyahu from the right, Barak from the left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have the same profile,'' said Shmuel Lederer,
mayor of a small West Bank settlement. ``No matter who is elected,
we won't feel much change.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis feel that this is a critical election in which
they will select the leader who oversees sensitive negotiations
over a Palestinian state, an Israeli military withdrawal from
southern Lebanon, and the fate of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   But they are weary of the high-decibel level of Israeli
politics, disgusted by dirty deals and profoundly skeptical of the
maturation of the process in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Navon and Shoshana Armand, lifelong members of Netanyahu's Likud
Party, do not even know if they will bother to vote on May 17,
which is a holiday, a day off work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' said Armand, a bus driver in Beersheba. ``If we're
not on a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   EFRAT
</P>
<P>
   In this large Jewish settlement in the arid, rocky West Bank,
the grass is green, the flowers plentiful and the stores modern and
well-stocked. It looks like an Arizona suburb and, with 6,450
people, it is effectively a bedroom community for Jerusalem. But
while some residents chose it for its amenities, many elected to
live in Efrat for purely ideological reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the small shopping plaza, the town bakery, which sells
croissants and prayer shawls, is decorated, inside and out, with
Netanyahu's face. In 1996, Efrat voted overwhelmingly for the prime
minister, and most residents still back him.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Netter, 22, a cheery clerk at the unusually efficient post
office, said it did not require much thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the only one who supports us,'' said Netter, an
immigrant from France. ``Look how we have grown here and how many
new settlements have popped up during his time in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Eti Avrahami, however, is sharply critical of the prime
minister, speaking more like a small business owner than a settler.
Her family owns a grocery store in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to believe in Bibi,'' she said. ``But everything
seemed to come to a halt under him. The economy is down. The
society is stuck. There's no forward motion, no swoosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Avrahami echoed the themes of Barak's campaign against
Netanyahu. People like her, defectors from the committed core of
Netanyahu supporters, are very worrisome to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   BET HAGGAI
</P>
<P>
   If Efrat is suburban, this town near Hebron is a hard-core
settlement, a Zionist outpost among the Palestinian towns. It has a
frontier feeling, and the many shuttered houses on its edges
suggest that the living is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Bet Haggai, however, where 98.8 percent of voters
selected Netanyahu last time, the prime minister does not have the
electorate sewn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want to punish Netanyahu because he did not
stop Oslo,'' the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement signed in
1993, said Lederer, the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Yisrael Buskila, 24, is only a renter, a newlywed who moved in
because the price was right and the view was splendid. But he
believes from his core that Israel should hold onto as much of the
West Bank as possible. If Benny Begin, the right-wing candidate for
prime minister, had a chance, he would get Buskila's vote, he said.
But he doesn't, so Buskila said he will vote for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not believe in the prime minister, but that the
traits he finds unappealing _ his perceived arrogance and wiliness
_ are those that make him tough at the peace negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Netanyahu, you see him holding the Palestinians by the
throat,'' he said. For parliament, however, Buskila will vote for
the far-right National Unity coalition. ``Why?'' he asked.
``Because they will be holding Bibi by the throat while he holds
the Palestinians.''
</P>
<P>
   BEERSHEBA
</P>
<P>
   In this desert town, far from the political centers of the
country, a Barak banner and a Netanyahu banner hang together as if
they are one sign _ sharing the same string, between two palm
trees.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to sum up the sleepy status of the campaign
battle in Beersheba, where many voters said they were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of Beersheba, a mixed town with many Sephardic
Jews, Russian immigrants and Israeli Arabs, voted for Netanyahu in
1996. Since then, though, the Likud town elected a Labor mayor, and
politically it is in flux.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthie Sheetrit, a hairdresser, said she would vote for
Netanyahu, as she did in 1996. But her endorsement is not ringing.
``Barak in power is an unknown,'' she said. ``With Bibi, we already
know the bad. So what I'm saying is, I'll go with the known evil.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, political scientists say that voting is tribal.
People are born into political parties _ the Ashkenazi or European
power elite and Israeli Arabs are Labor while the Sephardic or
Middle Eastern and African working class and the ultra-Orthodox are
Likud. But everywhere it seemed that the tribes were shifting
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Chaim Crispin, 46, for instance, was among those who selected
Netanyahu last time. But Crispin, a lifelong Likudnik who owns a
small metal business in Beersheba, said Netanyahu had immediately
detached him from his party loyalty. He will vote for Yitzhak
Mordechai, the Center Party candidate. And, in a runoff election,
if it comes to that, he will vote for Barak _ ``if there's no other
choice, because no way I'll vote for Bibi.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NETIVOT
</P>
<P>
   This somewhat desolate southern town that is home to poor and
working class Sephardic Jews is an unlikely tourist destination.
But Netivot has the tomb of Baba Sali, the late Rabbi Yisrael
Abuhatzeira, a Moroccan-born sage who was revered as a healer and
miracle worker. And Jews of North African descent flock there in
tour buses,
</P>
<P>
   If there is anything that is unadulterated Netanyahu territory,
this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Yhye Dahan, who is 63 but looks much older, sells Baba Sali
portraits, holy oil and amulets in the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 42 years here in the grave,'' he said. ``I worked here
even before the rabbi was dead. I know they pray here for
everything, including candidates. And all the religious Sephardi
follow Bibi.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a raucous bar mitzvah was being celebrated with cous
cous and grilled meat. One man banged a drum, while another
strummed an oud. Shouting above the revelry, Felix Smadar, a port
worker, said, ``We're Bibi. Why? Because he's a strong man, and all
the Arabs are afraid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But within every group, there is a freethinker. Cheli Azulay,
who was celebrating her one-week wedding anniversary at the tomb,
said she will vote for Mordechai, defying her new husband, because
she dislikes Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes voters have very personal motivations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes his wife everywhere, this Bibi,'' Mrs. Azulay said.
Yitzhak ``Rabin _ God bless his soul _ did he drag his wife around
with him? What is this? I don't like it''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)

immigrants from the former Soviet Union and older immigrants from
North Africa, Ilana Tveritzim cuddled her small, blond daughter.
</P>
<P>
   A clerk at an employment agency, she left Russia nine years ago.
And she is one of the immigrant voters that the candidates are
furiously courting because they seem less wedded to parties than
native-born Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Tveritzim is abandoning Netanyahu. ``He tends to bump his
head against other heads,'' she said. ``That is not good in a
leader. Maybe Barak is more mature.'
</P>
<P>
   At her non-kosher delicatessen in Ashlelon, stocked with
sausages, Tanya Levin, of Minsk, said she is defecting from
Netanyahu, too, because the economy is depressed. And Renata
Koeppel, who immigrated to Israel four years ago from the Ukraine,
said that her friends are feeling the sting of rising unemployment.
She works at a new toy store, where she beat out 100 other
immigrants for the job, her boss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will vote Barak,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing about their fellow countrymen, Uri and Natalie Datchek
were disappointed. ``Maybe they are not thinking about Israel, but
themselves,'' Datchek said, endorsing Netanyahu because ``he is
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   RAMAT AVIV GIMMEL
</P>
<P>
   This community is so notorious as the affluent yuppie center of
Tel Aviv that it is the name of the Israeli television's version of
Beverly Hills 90210. In 1996, Ramat Aviv Gimmel came out strongly
for Shimon Peres, the Labor Party leader who lost to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the places where Israelis say they will sink into
a deep depression _ or go abroad for a while _ if Netanyahu is
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Sari Yisrael, who is a real estate broker, was meeting some
clients at a cafe in an upscale food court in the local mall. She
said she and her friends are panicked at the possibility of a
Netanyahu victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it will be Bibi, it will be tragedy _ disaster,'' she said.
``If he wins, I think I'm going to lock myself in the house for a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   ABU GHOSH
</P>
<P>
   In his immaculate shop in this relatively prosperous Arab
village in the Judean hills, Ibrahim stood between towering bottles
of olive oil and hookahs, which were on sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man like me, not a Jew _ on the one hand, they are telling
me this is not your state,'' said Ibrahim. ``On the other , they
are telling me you have the right to vote. So what is the value of
that right in a place they say I don't belong?''
</P>
<P>
   Election campaigns underscore the quandary of Israeli Arabs,
citizens who feel they are treated as second class. With more than
300,000 voters, they represent an important bloc. In the past,
their turnout, which is relatively low by Israeli standards, has
been somewhat assured by their desire to cast a ballot for the Arab
parties in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But in this election, where there is likely to be a runoff, will
they be motivated to vote a second time, to choose between Barak
and Netanyahu? In a close race, the answer is very important to
Barak, and his party is working hard to overcome the cynicism many
Israeli Arabs feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leftist parties scream, ``Give us your vote so that we can
get back in power and make things right for you,' `' Ibrahim said.
``Then regimes change, but nothing changes for us. They are right
to worry about the Israeli-Arab turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   MEA SHEARIM
</P>
<P>
   In the shopping district near here, the walls are plastered with
posters warning the typically right-wing residents against casting
a blank ballot for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``White slip, black future,'' the new posters say ominously.
</P>
<P>
   A community-wide campaign is urging strictly religious Jews in
Mea Shearim to be neutral in the prime minister's race. It is a
pragmatic response to the possibility that Barak could win as well
as an expression of the feeling that the religious community has
become too politicized.
</P>
<P>
   Standing near one wall of posters, Rickie Sofer, who immigrated
to Israel 30 years ago from Brooklyn, said she was considering
abstaining altogether, even from the vote for parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, between you and me, I think they're all
dishonest,'' she said. ``Last time, I voted for Netanyahu. He looks
like a gentleman. But I'm very disappointed by his conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sofer is unusually independent-minded. Most members of the
religious community vote according to their rabbis' recommendation,
although most rabbis have not yet made their endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for whom she would cast her ballot, Asya Konofnitsky, a
young mother who held her tiny daughter's hand at a bus stop,
looked stunned by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I know?'' she said. ``The Torah sages have been
silent. What they tell me. That's what I will vote.''

 &HT;    SLIPPING IN POLLS, NETANYAHU HAS TROUBLE KEEPING SECURITY ON
VOTERS MINDS
 &HT;    400&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMLA, Israel _ Trailing Labor Party challenger Ehud Barak in
opinion polls with just six days before the vote, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu preached to his followers Tuesday night
in the familiar language of his right-wing Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is going to face Arafat? Barak or Likud? Who is going to
face (Syria's) Asad? Barak or Likud? Who is going to defend
Jerusalem?'' he shouted to a rowdy Likud crowd packed in a wedding
hall in this blue-collar city.
</P>
<P>
   But, try as he might, Netanyahu has been unable to focus the
upcoming elections on the hard stance against the Arabs that was
once his political strength.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Netanyahu suffered a setback when an Israeli
court postponed his ordered partial closing of Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) offices in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling said that any closure of offices at the Orient
House, an old mansion used as the PLO's unofficial Jerusalem
headquarters, would have to wait until after the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's opponents noted that the building had been operating
throughout his three-year term and that the prime minister just
wanted to look tough against the Arabs or possibly stir up
Palestinian unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling may have diffused a major crisis in the peace
process. Palestinians had threatened violence if, as was implied,
Israeli police stormed their building.
</P>
<P>
   But, the decision dulled an arrow in Netanyahu's political
quiver and increased the chances that security issues will not
decide this Israeli election as they have most others.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has tried several times to move terrorism and peace
process issues to the forefront. Two weeks ago, he enraged some
Israelis when he featured 1996 video clips of bus bombings in his
political commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It was those bombings, in which more than 50 Israelis were
killed by Palestinian terrorists, that undermined the popularity of
then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres and may have handed the close
victory to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But, this election season has been free of terrorism --
something for which Netanyahu can, and often does, claim credit.
But, while security is clearly a major issue to most Israelis, many
of them have long decided their vote. The campaign has focused on
wooing Israel's small undecided vote, which seems to be concerned
with other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we know his success in fighting terror is
counter-productive electorally,'' said Israeli political scientist
Efraim Inbar. ``Now, people take it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Several other factors have made security and the peace process
less of an issue this year.
</P>
<P>
   First, other issues have taken the spotlight. A recent poll
showed that most Israelis believe that the bitter rift between
fundamentalist religious Jews and secular Jews is the country's
biggest problem -- larger than the split between hawks and doves on
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, Netanyahu's opponents have been successful in raising
questions about his integrity and competence.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the differences among the candidates on peace issues
appears to be narrow. Barak and the other major candidate, Yitzhak
Mordechai, are former generals with better military credentials
than Netanyahu. They also take hard lines on the peace process.
They might be a little more forthcoming than Netanyahu in dealing
with the Palestinians, but maybe not by much.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sting of the campaign, the Arabs, has been neutralized,''
said pollster Hanoch Smith. ``It's very hard to find any
differences among any one of the three main candidates as to what
they're saying about the main issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Israelis have reached a consensus on many important
peace process issues. Most, for example, seem grudgingly willing to
allow limited Palestinian statehood.

NETANYAHU STRUGGLES IN BID FOR POLITICAL SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ With five days before Israel's general election,
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's fight for political survival is
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night Netanyahu released a new prime-time television ad
in which he pleaded with supporters to stick by him, a message
whose tone of desperation seemed a far cry from the confident,
telegenic conservative who came from behind to win in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never claimed that I am free of errors,'' Netanyahu
said. ``You who are partners in our principles, in our path, I
beseech you to put aside every other consideration _ I beseech you
to come back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts, even those who support him, said the ads
amounted to an admission that Netanyahu's campaign for reelection
had imploded in recent weeks with intense infighting within his
fractured government coalition and its diverse constituency.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent polls show Netanyahu steadily declining against
the more liberal Labor Party challenger Ehud Barak. Netayanhu is
now trailing in polls by an average of 8 percent, and polls
expected to be released Wednesday will, according to Israeli
television, put him even further behind.
</P>
<P>
   Amnon Lord, a weekly columist for the popular daily newspaper
Yediot Ahronot who supports Netanyahu, said, ``The polls are
worrisome; there is no avoiding that. But it is very difficult to
gauge the Israeli electorate in polls. So I think he will survive
this first round, and then it's a whole new ball game in the second
round.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Ben-Simone, who is covering the campaign for the
leading daily newspaper Ha'aretz, said, ``These polls are very
real, and very clear. It is the end of Netanyahu's term.
</P>
<P>
   ``After driving miles and miles through Likud land, I can tell
you it looks like an earthquake. There is nothing left. The
offices, the activists are not there. At this time three years ago,
Jerusalem was in flames in terms of the Likud presence. But Bibi is
being abandoned by his party, especially the Russian community. It
is an expression of massive discontent.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, voters will cast ballots in a five-way race. But
Barak is not expected to win an absolute majority, so the two
leading contenders, almost certainly Barak and Netanyahu, will face
a run-off on June 1.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Netanyahu's fraying campaign appears to be the
failure of what the Israeli media have dubbed his ``doomsday''
approach of trying to stir Israeli voters' fears over security
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Netanyahu seized on the emotional issue of the
status of Jerusalem by threatening to close offices used by
Palestinian political leaders in historically Arab East Jerusalem.
On Monday, Netanyahu ordered the offices, known as Orient House,
closed, and violence was expected to erupt if Israeli forces
attempted to close the offices by force.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu heightened tensions by saying that Barak would allow
Jerusalem to be divided in ``final status'' peace talks with
Palestinians, which have been delayed by at least one year in the
deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis regard Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible
capital. But Palestinians call East Jerusalem, which was captured
by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War, as the capital of its future
state.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Israel's High Court ordered Netanyahu's government to
delay closing the offices at Orient House for at least a week,
defusing the issue until after the election.
</P>
<P>
   The move to shut down Orient House, widely seen as politically
motivated, was sharply criticized even by one of Netanyahu's
long-time supporters in the Likud Party, Jerusalem Mayor Ehud
Olmert.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has denied that he was using the issue as an election
ploy.

DUMA ANNOUNCES HEARINGS TO IMPEACH YELTSIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia edged toward a new political crisis Tuesday as
legislators set impeachment proceedings against President Boris N.
Yeltsin for this week amid growing speculation of a major
government shakeup.
</P>
<P>
   Ekho Moskvy radio, citing Kremlin sources, reported Tuesday that
Yeltsin was preparing to fire Prime Minister Yevgeny M. Primakov
and replace him with little-known Railways Minister Nikolai
Aksyonenko.
</P>
<P>
   It almost did not matter that the Kremlin later denied the
report: Rumors of a government shakeup have intensified as the
long-delayed impeachment proceedings against Yeltsin have moved
closer to conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, leaders of the State Duma, the opposition-dominated
lower house of parliament, announced that the chamber would hold
three days of impeachment debates starting Thursday and could vote
as early as Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a touch of drama to the process, the Duma's Communist
speaker, Gennady Seleznyov, Tuesday ordered security increased at
the parliament building in central Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists and their allies, the driving force behind the
impeachment effort, have been predicting that Yeltsin could try to
close down parliament by force. Yeltsin has already done that once,
in 1993, causing a standoff that ended in a military assault
against the Legislature by pro-Kremlin troops and tanks that left
at least 140 dead.
</P>
<P>
   Few others are predicting such a violent outcome this time. The
impeachment process, as outlined in the Constitution Yeltsin
adopted after winning his battle with parliament in 1993, makes it
extremely difficult to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin has indicated he may fire Primakov, who is popular
in the Duma, to retaliate if the house votes for impeachment. The
president has a history of abruptly firing his senior lieutenants _
he sacked two prime ministers last year _ and has little patience
for aides who overshadow him, as Primakov has done in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gennady Zyuganov, head of the Communist bloc that is
the Duma's largest, raised the stakes more by warning that Russians
would take to the streets if Yeltsin dismissed Primakov, who rates
as the country's most popular politician in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff, Oleg Sysuyev, denied
any changes were being planned. It was Sysuyev who only days
earlier fueled rumors of Primakov's ouster in an interview with
Vlast magazine, in which he criticized the government's economic
policies and remarked that ``no prime minister is irreplaceable,
including Yevgeny Maximovich'' Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov Tuesday defended his record, saying he had stabilized
the ruble and confounded pessimists who had predicted
hyperinflation for Russia. The 69-year-old premier, limping from a
back ailment, also appealed to the Duma to vote against
impeachment, saying it ``does absolutely nothing for the creation
of political stability in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Duma will consider five charges against Yeltsin: that he
broke the law when he brought about the collapse of the Soviet
Union in 1991, improperly used force to dissolve parliament in
1993, conducted policies that ruined the Russian army, waged
``genocide'' against the Russian people by pursuing economic
policies that impoverished the people, and illegally waged war from
1994 to 1996 against the rebel region of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of these counts, on the Chechen conflict, which killed
tens of thousands of Russian citizens, is believed to have a chance
of receiving the 300 votes necessary in the 450-seat Duma to pass.
</P>
<P>
   If any of the charges are approved by the Duma, they would be
reviewed by Russia's Supreme Court and Constitutional Court before
going to a final vote in the Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament, which has twice defied Yeltsin in major votes this
year. But many observers, noting that the two courts are appointed
by Yeltsin, give little chance of the vote actually making it to
the upper house anytime before the president's term is set to end
in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, opposition lawmakers seem intent on drawing attention
to their positions before this December's parliamentary elections.

LARGE STOCKPILE OF WEAPONS SEIZED BY SOUTH AFRICAN POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ The police announced Tuesday that
they had uncovered a vast cache of arms and ammunition in a bunker
in KwaZulu-Natal province, aggravating tensions as South Africa's
second post-apartheid elections approach on June 2.
</P>
<P>
   The stockpile, believed to be the biggest uncovered in South
Africa, were found in Nquthu, about 20 miles west of Ulundi, the
former headquarters of Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the head of the
Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   The find was announced on a day when officials from Inkatha and
President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress gathered in
Pietermaritzburg to talk about ways to ease tensions between the
two parties, which have been locked in a struggle for dominance in
the province for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials say the province is awash with
weapons, many of them left over from the most intense period of
fighting between the two groups, before the elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting continued even after the election, easing only in 1997
and 1998 after prolonged peace negotiations. But rights monitors
have warned of increasing violence as campaigning began this year.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials were led to the cache, which included more
than seven tons of arms, ammunition and explosives, by Phillip
Powell, a prominent member of Inkatha. In recent weeks there have
been numerous newspaper articles suggesting that the flamboyant
Powell, who is often seen heavily armed, was about to be arrested
for gun-running.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement to the South African Press Association, Powell
said the rumors of his impending arrest had led him to approach the
police with information about the bunker. He said he had negotiated
immunity for himself, though the director of public prosecutions,
Bulelani Ngcuka, later said no such deal had been struck.
</P>
<P>
   The arsenal _ which included several rocket launchers, 1,484
rifle grenades, 140 antipersonnel mines and more than 4,300
detonators _ was found buried in a bunker about 12 feet deep. The
police entered through a manhole.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Buthelezi said he welcomed any steps that would
foster peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been informed about any aspects of this matter, and
I am not yet in a position to comment about it,'' he said. ``I can
merely state that I am pleased that any arms caches are
recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell apparently told authorities that the weapons were
originally supplied to him by the former members of the police
force before the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the province was racked by violence among blacks,
and some members of the white government were secretly promoting
the conflict by arming Inkatha. More than 12,000 people died in
what has often been referred to as a low-grade civil war in Natal.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, the conflict between Inkatha and the
African National Congress has eased, and Inkatha has served in the
coalition government. When both Mandela and his deputy, Thabo
Mbeki, have been out of the country, Buthelezi has served as acting
president, a role he reportedly enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation that Buthelezi will be given a
prominent position in the next government as well, though the ANC,
which is expected to win the election easily, has no obligation to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   But recently the political language has turned harsher and
incidents of violence have been on the rise, though it is often
difficult to distinguish political violence from clan fighting and
disputes over control of certain business interests, such as taxi
routes.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen people have died in the last month in incidents linked
to political violence, far fewer than in the months before the 1994
elections.

PATCHED-UP KLA FIGHTERS AWAIT RETURN TO BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ The first shot did not stop him. Neither did
the second or the third. But by the twenty-third bullet Agron
Berisha was on the ground, awake and waiting to die.
</P>
<P>
   He lived.
</P>
<P>
   Now the 22-year-old soldier is recuperating in the six-room
alley apartment where the Kosovo Liberation Army sends its wounded
to heal. Open eight months, scores of foot soldiers and a few KLA
officers have been treated at what they call ``the hospital,''
where most of the medicine is dangerously outdated and the
intravenous stands are rusty with age.
</P>
<P>
   KLA doctors do visit daily, but surgery and other serious
medical procedures are performed at the Albanian military hospital
on the outskirts of Tirana. The one-bathroom apartment is for
afterward. Some soldiers stay for days, others for months. With two
dozen beds pushed against every available wall, they sometimes have
to double up.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers smoking on the long, narrow balcony or just staring
at the walls inside insist they do not mind. To them, the spare but
clean apartment is a place to ready themselves to fight again. Even
Berisha, injured nine months ago in an attack where the Serbs
outnumbered the KLA by two-to-one, hopes to return to the
battlefield one day. For now, though, he is limping on crutches and
using a colostomy bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I'll be OK, and when I am OK, I am going right
back to fight,'' said the softspoken Berisha, who joined the KLA
last spring. ``I'm really mad now. When I get better, I am going
right to Kosovo to get my revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's commander, whose chiseled cheekbones and crinkly eyes
could get him cast in that exact role in a Hollywood war movie,
ordered them not to discuss battle strategies, arms strength or
anything else that could help the Serbs beat them back into
Albania. But speaking through a Kosovar interpreter, the soldiers
appeared to have few secrets to give away.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on the beds that are the apartment's only furniture,
they spoke openly of being outnumbered but remaining optimistic, of
watching comrades die and greeting newcomers to war. From the
conversation, fatalities appeared to be high, injuries higher,
although no one could offer any numbers. Several did say that at
least 30 KLA fighters are being treated at the local military
hospital at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   As the soldiers explained, reports filtering back from Kosovo
indicate fighting in every corner of the country. No road, they
said, is safe for the civilian Kosovars still stuck there and the
fighters who chose to stay, some of them women. Many of the
soldiers have had no word of their own families' plight in the last
month and have been unable to get word to them that they are
injured but alive.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa Bajraktari, the most veteran soldier among the wounded
and also the oldest at 40, said two of the four soldiers traveling
with him were killed during a late January ambush by Serbian
police. Shot three times, he was treated in the field, went back to
fighting, and waited two months to come to Tirana to see what could
be done about his left arm. From shoulder to elbow, the bone is
shattered; connected only by muscle, it jiggles like jelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 32 soldiers in my group, and I want to get back to
them,'' said Bajraktari, who described his rank as something like a
sergeant. ``I have been fighting a long time, and I am very proud
of how many people want to fight with us now.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers said they would like the chance to fight alongside
US Army troops, and they urged President Clinton to send them. As
Osman Musliu, a 30-year-old who suffered a severe concussion and
other injuries when he fell during a skirmish, put it, ``We want
American ground troops to finish this war once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   From the second-floor apartment at least, the soldiers seemed an
unlikely, disorganized band.
</P>
<P>
   No two described a similar training regime, with one saying he
had four months' worth and another saying he taught himself to
shoot using his own gun. They did agree that the recruits now
coming from as far away as America to sign up are spending as
little as 15 days in the KLA training camps around Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This army is all volunteer; no one orders us there,'' said the
self-trained Shefqet Gashi, 28, who joined the KLA last May, was
injured in September when he fell during a firefight, and is
recovering from knee surgery. ``So we can fight because it comes
from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Gashi and the others wore cast-off uniforms that came
from one country or another or were sewn locally. In Tirana, they
wear donated clothes that this soldier may wear one day, that
soldier the next. They pass shoes around to find a good fit. A
soldier whose leg is in a cast must wash his foot in the bidet.
</P>
<P>
   In the medical supply room, where soldiers also sleep, several
huge boxes were filled to overflowing with bottles and packages of
drugs, almost all of them unusable. One sterile compress expired in
1992, a supply of amoxicillin in 1997. The X-ray machine was bound
together with heavy tape. The officer in charge of the facility
said he could think of no basic medical supplies _ from antibiotics
to bandages to crutches _ that the KLA had enough of, both at the
army's field hospitals and in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, who asked to be identified only as Jashar, said the
KLA also needs foreign hospitals to care for its injured, since
there are no specialists or equipment in Albania to rebuild the
knees, elbows, and other joints shattered by bullets or bombs. The
other day, several were sent to Turkey. England took three and
Germany, two, Jashar said. Visas to other countries have proven
almost impossible to obtain, he added, noting that the KLA lacks
the money to transport the wounded overseas anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Jashar came to the apartment six months ago to recuperate. Years
ago, he said, he was shot. Next he was hit by an anti-tank mine and
hospitalized for three months. His most recent injury was also the
most serious: blinded by a grenade, he spent six weeks wondering
whether he would ever see again. Still, he said he will gladly
fight again when he is healthy and not needed in the apartment.
</P>
<P>
   None of the soldiers knew how he would be returned to the
border, and some expected they would walk. That is how Naim Tatari,
19, reached Albania after a grenade blast broke one of his ribs in
Kosovo on April 30: 12 hours alone by foot. To keep his mind off
the pain, he told himself over and over how lucky he was to be
alive. ``The first thing I thought when it happened was that I am
all in pieces,'' Tatari said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, he has been eating at cheap restaurants around town
with the other soldiers and talking up the KLA to youngsters who
approach them. Many spoke of pats on the back from strangers who
identified themselves as Kosovar refugees. Tirana, like many
Albanian cities, is crowded with them now. Every so often, one of
them picks up the soldiers' meals. That is good enough for the
soldiers, who stressed that they do not expect every able Kosovar
to join their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every one of us is in a different kind of fight for
Kosovo,'' Berisha said as the others nodded. ``Even if they are not
in the KLA, we are all fighting in our own way.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In late April, lawyers for Island ECN, a computerized
stock-trading service that opened for business less than three
years ago, applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission to
become America's newest stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Island's owners acknowledge they are taking a leap of faith as
they set out to compete on an equal basis with the 207-year-old New
York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ market, born a quarter-century
ago. Like those exchanges, Island deals with brokerage firms, not
individual investors, but its software offers a difference:
automatically matching up orders from buyers and sellers without
going through a dealer or trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   Island is a novice, though, in the regulatory labyrinth. ``We
don't even know how much it will cost us to go through the SEC
process,'' said Edward Nicoll, chief operating officer of Datek
Online Holdings Corp., which owns Island. ``We've guessed $10
million'' _ a figure that Island's 28-year-old president, Matthew
Andresen, acknowledged making up out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   As Americans gallop into the stock market seeking instant riches
or retirement security, the basic trading machinery is also being
made up on the fly. Driven by technology, upstarts like Island are
luring trades away from NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange by
offering nanosecond service and microscopic fees. Those older
markets are fighting back, proposing longer trading hours, new
rules and changes in their ownership structure aimed at making them
more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a revolution; it is an earthquake,'' said Robert
Schwartz, a finance professor at Baruch College in New York.
</P>
<P>
   And the fault lines lead directly to the SEC, which is
responsible for maintaining investor confidence in a marketplace
that behind the scenes is changing almost beyond recognition. The
agency must make sure that rapid change does not create new
opportunities for fraud or conflicts of interest and that investors
are not shortchanged amid the confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time of evolution and change,'' said Annette
Nazareth, the SEC's new director of market regulation. ``When you
have those dynamics, you can't always predict what the next step
will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenarios range from a fragmented world of competing
exchanges like Island, each catering to a different trading
community, to a monolithic world where today's competitors have
merged into a single network that trades foreign and domestic
stocks around the clock.
</P>
<P>
   So far, regulators seem sure that whatever market model emerges
will be cheaper, faster and fairer for all investors. But the SEC's
ad hoc approach to a changing marketplace has made it a lightning
rod for Wall Street's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulators are having as tough a time as everybody else trying
to figure out what their new priorities should be,'' said John
Byrne, editor of The Trader, a Wall Street magazine. ``We all need
to tread a little more carefully _ there's too much at stake, from
the livelihood of market makers to the health of the nation's
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the same technology that has produced the market's
structural earthquake has produced an explosion of Internet stock
gossip and online investing, which themselves produce myriad
opportunities for fraud.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress urging more attention to online abuses, SEC
Chairman Arthur Levitt announced May 4 that he was asking for
enough new money to double his ``cyberforce,'' the 125-lawyer team
devoted to policing the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And the next day, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., introduced a
bill requiring disclosure of online brokers' service records,
raising the penalties for online fraud and increasing the five-year
budget authorization for the SEC's Internet efforts.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, little public attention has been paid to the SEC's
market regulation division _ though that ``is where the real
changes are happening,'' said John Coffee, a Columbia University
law professor.
</P>
<P>
   Island's application is just one of the novel issues pummeling
the SEC. Others include proposals to extend trading hours on NASDAQ
and the New York exchange and to convert the fractional stock
quotes to dollars and cents. NASDAQ dealers want to collect fees
for matching buyers and sellers, as Big Board floor specialists and
computerized traders like Island do, and the Big Board is planning
to acquire or build its own computerized system to compete with
NASDAQ.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the
parent of NASDAQ and the American Stock Exchange, is wrestling over
demands for trading halts in volatile Internet stocks. And the Big
Board is looking for ways to enable traders to buy foreign stocks
in Frankfurt in the morning and sell the same shares in New York in
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Some market participants trace the current tumult to two earlier
SEC initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1996, the commission imposed new rules for handling
customers' trading orders, after NASDAQ dealers were accused of
fixing prices for over-the-counter stocks. Dealers were directed to
display on NASDAQ's trading screens any superior prices they had
posted on private trading networks like Island.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the electronic communication networks' share of NASDAQ
trading boomed. Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton, a San
Francisco investment bank, calculated that these networks handled
nearly 29 percent of all NASDAQ trades the last three months of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in December, the SEC adopted a new set of rules to govern
electronic networks and other ``alternative trading systems.'' The
rules allow the networks to apply to become exchanges, the
marketplace equals of NASDAQ and the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Island's application is the first test, and the commission is
moving cautiously. After all, Ms. Nazareth said, approving a new
exchange hasn't been done in 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   And Island is a controversial applicant, in part because a
sister subsidiary, Datek Online, is an online broker catering to
day traders _ individuals who speculate on short-term stock
positions _ who have prompted so much regulatory concern. Nicoll
said Island would be well insulated from Datek's brokerage
business.

RICKY MARTIN'S GOT THE GOODS, BUT DOES HE HAVE STAYING POWER?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like most overnight successes, Puerto Rican singer Ricky
Martin's didn't really come overnight. But you can pinpoint the
date _ and if you tried hard, the time _ that Martin became more
than just a success, when he became huge: Feb. 24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Martin aroused a somnambulant Grammy Awards ceremony
with a flamboyant rendition of ``La Copa de la Vida (The Cup of
Life),'' a nearly year-old song most Grammy viewers probably had
never heard. Rising from beneath the stage, the handsome young
singer led a carnival-style production number, complete with
streamers, balloons, dancers on stilts, and percussionists charging
through the audience. His mesmerizing performance was rewarded with
the night's only spontaneous standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Anglo America, say ``hola'' to a new superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever did that was a genius,'' says Dave Morales, music
director for Top 40 radio station KHKS/106.1 FM (KISS-FM), where
Martin's single ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' rocketed into the Top 5
less than a month after it debuted March 29. ``Everybody still
talks about that performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's talking about Martin, too. ``La Vida Loca'' was No.
1 on last week's Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, in only its
fourth week on the chart. People magazine put him on its latest 50
Most Beautiful People in the World list. At the Grammys, host Rosie
O'Donnell made lecherous remarks about the handsome 27-year-old
singer. Madonna quickly arranged to record a duet with him. Luciano
Pavarotti invited him to perform in a ``Pavarotti and Friends''
concert this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Martin _ unfamiliar to most Americans before Feb. 24,
even though he had already sold 13 million albums as a solo artist
_ had a lot of friends.
</P>
<P>
   And with Tuesday's release of ``Ricky Martin,'' the singer's
first English-language album, he'll have a lot more. Dan Lightner,
manager of the music store at Borders Books and Music on Hulen
Street in Fort Worth, says that interest in the album has been high
ever since the Grammys. And in Tejano-friendly Texas, it doesn't
seem to matter that Martin isn't a Tejano artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Lightner says. ``People you wouldn't expect to
be buying Latin music are buying his albums, either kids or
middle-aged people buying it for kids.'' Lightner says that often,
when customers come in and ask for the not-yet-released new album,
they still buy one of Martin's Spanish-language releases such as
last year's ``Vuelve'' _ which has sold more than a million copies
in the States, and a reported 5 million worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   If you still haven't heard of Martin, don't worry _ you will.
For the rest of the year, there'll be no escaping him. He's already
magazine-cover material and a drool-worthy fixture on MTV and VH1.
Although Morales wouldn't give specifics, KISS plans to bring him
for an in-store appearance during the next few weeks (Martin drew
7,000 people at a similar appearance recently in LA). He appeared
on last week's ``Saturday Night Live'' and Tuesday was on MTV's
``Total Request Live.'' Soon, Martin's conquering of the United
States will be complete.
</P>
<P>
   Or will it? Although Martin is certainly talented _ ``Livin' La
Vida Loca'' is infernally catchy, lingering in your brain days
after you hear it _ there's a sense that his appeal is more visual
than aural. He's great-looking and approachably sexy _ but then, so
are a lot of pop stars; he's a great showman. But talent and looks
aside, is Martin _ the beneficiary of a massive publicity campaign
from Sony Music _ simply just one of the most glaring examples
we've ever seen of the star-maker machinery at work?
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Burr, who covers Latin music for the San Antonio Express
News, doesn't think so. Although he wonders about Martin's staying
power, he believes that Martin's the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a skeptic, too,'' Burr says. ``Right place, right time,
right producer, right label. But I don't think there's any
publicity creation at work here. The guy has a decent voice. He's
broken his chops with Menudo.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, Menudo. Martin was a founding member of the '80s
Latino boy band, a fact that Martin's publicist dismissed with,
``We don't even discuss Menudo.'' Still, his work with the group is
undeniably part of his appeal _ here's a teen singer made good,
much in the same way that former New Kids on the Block singers
Jordan Knight and Joey McEntire have broken through as
dance-friendly adult acts (Rolling Stone recently led its album
review section with a roundup of all three artists' most recent
discs).
</P>
<P>
   And Menudo's only one chapter in Martin's past. Even as he was
becoming a Latin-music superstar, Martin was making himself
familiar to Anglo audiences. He appeared on Broadway in ``Les
Miserables,'' and did a 1994-'96 stint on the ABC soap opera
``General Hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   These angles help give Martin multiple spin appeal, as does his
Latino heritage. Some observers are predicting that Latin music
will be the Next Big Thing, with Martin leading a musical
revolution that pulls along such contemporaries as longtime
heartthrob Luis Miguel, Enrique Iglesias (Julio's son), Elvis
Crespo and salsa singer Mark Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   But then, a couple of years ago, music critics predicted that
techno music was going to be the next big thing, and that didn't
happen. Latin music's previous breakthrough artists haven't led to
a full-scale explosion _ not Santana, not Miami Sound Machine, and
not Selena, although some believe that she would have led a
Latin-music boom had her life not been cut short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crossover is more of a myth for Latin music than a reality,''
says Enrique Fernandez, a columnist for the Sun-Sentinel in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. (where Martin owns a restaurant, Casa Salsa).
``Miami Sound Machine had to become Gloria Estefan to cross over.
They started doing more dance-oriented music and very quickly
became big.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez believes that Martin's appeal is largely visual. But
then, he says, that's the way it is with most pop music these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about being a great singer, but about being a great
entertainer,'' Fernandez says. ``There's a lot of raw talent in
Latin music, but people don't see it because it's not packaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Morales, the KISS music director, says the packaging wouldn't
matter, though, if Martin's music weren't grabbing people's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song is great,'' Morales says. ``The record is one of our
top three most requested songs, and you can't see him on the
radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders' Lightner agrees that one thing will keep Martin in the
limelight for some time: His music just plain sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's perfect summer music,'' Lightner says. ``It's gonna be
booming out of everybody's stereos this summer.''

   A pending investment by Waterhouse Investor Services, a unit of
Toronto-Dominion Bank, will put $25 million in Island's coffers,
adding to the fraction of a penny it gets for each trade. And as an
exchange, Island would get a share of the millions of dollars
investors pay for up-to-the-minute stock prices. But it would also

to market regulation, and the Big Board's internal police force
accounts for roughly a third of its 1,500-member staff.
</P>
<P>
   Andresen said Island would do its duty by being innovative _ for
example, it may hire outside accountants to audit its member
brokerage firms, at the firms' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Without commenting on Island's status, Ms. Nazareth warned that
some electronic networks might not fully grasp ``what it is going
to entail when you get to the nitty-gritty of being an exchange.''
Her deputy, Robert Colby, added, ``Doing self-regulatory oversight
on the cheap is not going to be sufficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Many market experts say that in hindsight the SEC should have
envisioned the need for a single self-regulatory police force in a
market composed of private, for-profit operations like Island.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, that issue is just now climbing up the SEC's
agenda: the NASD is considering spinning off its regulatory arm
into just such a free-standing entity _ but it proposes doing so in
conjunction with a plan to become a for-profit corporation. That
initiative, which could essentially make the NASDAQ market into a
NASDAQ stock, got an informal nod from Levitt last week, but its
implementation is at best months away, given the deliberative pace
of the agency's rule-making process.
</P>
<P>
   If the regulatory gait is measured, the pace of reinvention is
accelerating so fast that market executives are starting to compare
it to the convulsive changes that began on May 1, 1975, when fixed
brokerage commissions were abolished _ an event Wall Street calls
``May Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Venerable but bloated firms found they could not survive on the
thin commissions that mutual funds and other big investors
demanded. Funds flourished as trading costs shrank, but they had to
develop direct-to-consumer sales methods because stockbrokers
became less interested in marketing their wares. Individuals,
meanwhile, became a rich market for Charles Schwab and the other
discount brokers born in this era.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with computers like Island's replacing many human
relationships, Wall Street magazines like Institutional Investor
and The Trader are talking about ``May Day II.''
</P>
<P>
   Calling today's changes as significant as any that have occurred
since the early 1930s, William R. Johnston, president of the New
York Stock Exchange, drew knowing nods at a recent Wall Street
conference when he said, ``Your competitors today may be your
partners tomorrow, and your competitors tomorrow may not even exist
today.''
</P>
<P>
   How individual investors fare as all this unfolds will depend,
in part, on how well the SEC enforces rules that require brokers to
give customers ``the best execution'' of trades _ traditionally,
the best price.
</P>
<P>
   But even the definition of ``best execution'' has been muddied
by new technology and the emergence of new marketplaces, with
newcomers like Andresen arguing that the term should encompass the
speed and certainty of a trade, not just the price.
</P>
<P>
   Poor execution can cost small investors far more than they save
on low commissions, and online brokers sending orders to electronic
networks are already generating complaints.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech last week, Levitt warned Wall Street that his staff
was finding numerous instances of poor execution. The best-possible
execution was ``not just good business practice; it's a legal
obligation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But disciplinary cases have been rare, perhaps because
regulators ``are overwhelmed by some of the best-execution issues
that have arisen in this new trading environment,'' Coffee said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic studies support the SEC's pride in how its
order-handling rules have narrowed the spread between the prices at
which NASDAQ stocks can be bought and sold. But Douglas Atkin,
chief executive of Instinet, a unit of Reuters Group PLC and the
dominant private trading service, argues that the resulting market
turbulence has made life difficult for large institutional
investors, including pension accounts and mutual funds, which are
most Americans' foothold in the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SEC has done a lot of good things for the retail investor
trading 400 or 500 shares,'' Atkin said. ``What they need to take
more into account, as market structure evolves, is that retail
investors need a market that will work for them when they give
their money to their mutual fund managers, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Colby disputes that institutional investors are discontented.
``We have not heard any complaints,'' he said. But industry
executives point out that interest from institutions is one engine
driving the proliferation of alternative trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say the SEC should focus on protecting investors
and let the market evolve. Others argue that investors cannot be
protected in a market that is not fairly structured.
</P>
<P>
   But with so much at stake, it is clear that Wall Street is
watching the SEC carefully, particularly as it evaluates Island's
application. ``It is a bit premature to grade them yet,'' Coffee
said. ``But this is the big exam.'' &QL;

   The New York Times plans 2{ pages of stories, photos and

of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels) _ Rebuffing Yugoslavia's announcement
that it had begun a partial troop withdrawal from Kosovo, NATO said
today that there were no indications that any Yugoslav forces were
leaving the province. NATO also warned that it would not guarantee
the safety of any Serbian units that did try to retreat unless
President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to remove all of his troops.
Other military developments. By Michael R. Gordon.

<P>
   KOSOVO-PRISTINA (Pristina) _ She's seen too much, Meli said. She
wants a rest. She wants it to be over. She wants to leave, like her
friends, and go to Macedonia. But she wants to stay, because her
mother wants to stay, and it's her home and why should she leave
it? And it seems to be getting better, she says, in Pristina,
anyway. A feature on remaining ethnic Albanians in Pristina, the
Kosovo capital. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILITARY (Washington) _ A look at the National Imagery
and Mapping Agency, the Pentagon office that drew up the outdated
map that contributed to the accidental bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade. The agency has been embroiled in two other
international incidents in the past year, including the fatal
accident in Italy in which a Marine Corps jet using faulty maps
struck a ski-lift cable. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-CHINA (Beijing) _ Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian envoy,
meets on Kosovo with Chinese officials, who stick to their demand
that NATO bombing must stop before the U.N. Security Council adopts
a peace plan. Demonstrations against the embassy bombing wane. By
Erik Eckholm.
</P>

University, who have been leading the anti-American protests, talk

spurred on by their inability to face conflicts in the Balkans with
a joint armed force, agree to build a common defense structure by
next year. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TRIBUNAL (The Hague) _ International lawyers and
diplomats here believe that Yugoslavia has timed its announcement
to withdraw part of its troops from Kosovo to coincide with the
opening of its lawsuit against ten NATO nations before the
International Court of Justice. In this view, the Yugoslavs believe
that the move will bolster their case if the court calls for
cessation of hostilities. By Marlise Simons.

WHEN MEN WERE MEN AND PLAYERS RETALIATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Pat Burns pines for the good old days, when men were
men and were allowed to do what righteous and honorable men had to
do when necessary _ beat the innards out of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we put rules in to protect the players?'' he inquires.
``That's what they say. But we have more hitting from behind now
than there's ever been. There's more stickwork, more two-handed
slashes that are wicked and vicious.''
</P>
<P>
   He was thinking specifically of the Alexei Zhitnik ramming of
Ray Bourque on Sunday when, as the Captain pointed out, ``My
numbers were showing,'' and he was making an oblique reference to
the fact that the mentality of the suits who govern the game is
completely different than it was a generation or two ago.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the game actually may have been safer when a
perp knew he would be answering to the proper authority before the
game was over.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from (itals)a real(unitals) policeman: The game may have
been safer overall when hockey gendarmes roamed the ice. People
didn't get away with things without paying a penalty, the way they
often do now. Woe be to he who retaliates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be careful,'' says Ken Belanger, one Bruin who, it
seems to me, would have relished the old days. ``The refs call
(itals)everything.(unitals) They always seem to get the
retaliation. A big part of my game is finishing the check. I've had
times where I've finished the check and gotten called for
roughing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got two referees,'' Burns continues. ``They've got
supervisors. Guys are running down saying, `You missed that call,'
or `That wasn't a call.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But first you have the cheap shot, which may or may not merit a
penalty. If it does, fine. But if it doesn't, you now have to suck
it up, which would be an incomprehensible circumstance for a hockey
player of yore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just see what would have happened 20 years ago,''
surmises Kyle McLaren, who was a 1-year-old 20 years ago. ``Five
guys would have been on top of him (Zhitnik), right after it,
pounding away. In this day and age, it's not like that. I'd rather
have the five-on-three.''
</P>
<P>
   Kids! What's the matter with kids today? Eddie Shore never
talked like that.
</P>
<P>
   We're not necessarily talking about Eddie Shore's day, either.
Think back to 1980 and a series with the Islanders, then in search
of their first championship. In Game 4, Terry O'Reilly, a warrior
if ever there was one, had two knock-down drag-outs with Clark
Gillies and one with Garry Howatt before drawing a game misconduct.
That makes one more fighting major than has been assessed in the
entirety of the 1999 playoffs, pending any fisticuffs in Tuesday
night's action.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't even the best part of the series. The game
before, there were four fights at the conclusion of the first
period. It all started with a Mike Milbury-Duane Sutter fracas, and
before order was restored some 20 minutes later, there were bouts
featuring Stan Jonathan vs. Bob Lorimer; Wayne Cashman vs. Howatt;
and Al Secord vs. Gordie Lane. And let's not forget the sight of
Islanders goalkeeper Bill Smith shedding equipment as he ambled
down the ice, only to find himself jumped en route by Bruins backup
netminder Yves Belanger. Got a lump in the throat and mist in the
eye yet?
</P>
<P>
   No one is calling for the resumption of mayhem when Game 3 gets
under way at the Marine Midland Arena Wednesday night, even though,
in that sense, the game they played was more fun. The NHL has
decided that it was in the general best interests of the league to
downplay thuggery, and that's that. But beware, as always, of the
famed Law of Unintended Consequences. You probably could kill all
the rattlers, but you might not like having an influx of rodents
and assorted other pests. Likewise, what Burns is saying is that in
eliminating the true policeman you are fostering the cheap-shot
element, oftentimes coming from people who never would be goaded
into a fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zhitnik isn't going to fight,'' sneers Burns. ``Now if that
were (the injured) Rob Ray, he'd do what he wanted and then say,
`what are you going to do about it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   This is a relevant topic matter since folks on both sides of
this Bruins-Sabres confrontation think a line has been crossed. The
Bruins think that Buffalo, which is hardly a team of bruisers, has
been waging sort of a guerilla war of cheap shots. The Sabres think
the Bruins whine too much. They are also suggesting that Boston's
hallowed captain floppeth too much. The nerve!
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of gamesmanship going on here, and what else is
new? Burns says some things to get the attention of his team. He
says other things to get the attention of the officials. Lindy
Ruff, the Buffalo coach, made his own public appeal to the
officials following Game 1, when he suggested that the more
experienced Burns was better at manipulating the officials than he
was. This is all nothing new. It began, I think, with King Clancy.
Or perhaps King Henry VIII.
</P>
<P>
   Hockey is not a genteel sport. This isn't croquet. Hockey is a
hit-and-be-hit sport, and it has spent the better part of a century
defining itself in very manly terms. Like anything else, it can be
over-romanticized. Talk all you want about allowing burly men to
exact frontier justice by putting up their dukes, but it didn't
always end there. Who can forget the photo of Wayne Maki's stick
landing on the helmet-less head of (Terrible) Teddy Green? Is that
what we want?
</P>
<P>
   No, of course not. All Pat Burns wants is for manly men to keep
order in the time-honored way without worrying that every
extra-hard check following an uncalled charging becomes a power
play. He wants cowardly perps to skate around with a little fear.
Who could rightfully argue with that?

ZHITNIK WILL BE ON BRUINS' MINDS IN GAME 3 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ While they are distributing wanted posters of
Alexei Zhitnik, the Bruins must at least concede his good points.
If nothing else, he is a most democratic health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Showing no favoritism, the All-Star Sabres defenseman has
inflicted his worst playoff damage on one of his own. Miroslav
Satan's ankle got in the way of a Zhitnik slap shot during Game 3
of Buffalo's first-round sweep of Ottawa, and the Sabres haven't
seen the veteran winger _ or his team-high 40 goals _ since. The
only uniform Satan has worn in the past two weeks is a hospital
johnny, which he donned again for a bone scan Tuesday, and he won't
be available Wednesday night when Boston visits Marine Midland
Arena for the third round of this best-of-seven Eastern Conference
semifinal confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Zhitnik's wounding of Satan was purely accidental.
The Bruins maintain that his ambush of their captain and
indispensable cog, Ray Bourque, Sunday in Boston was premeditated
assault.
</P>
<P>
   While Bourque was able to resume his normal duties after being
checked from behind at 14:57 of the second period during Buffalo's
series-tying 3-1 victory, the Bruins contend that Zhitnik had no
right tampering with a civic treasure and that his transgression
merited far more than the two-minute penalty for boarding he was
assessed.
</P>
<P>
   Playoff stakes do not accommodate frontier justice. But the
Bruins _ even the normally placid Bourque _ have indicated that
prudent retribution may be in order against Zhitnik, who earlier in
Game 2 left Boston forward P.J. Axelsson in a brace following a
knee-on-knee collision and served up an appetizer for his infamous
hit on Bourque by charging the defenseman _ a hit Zhitnik admitted
(itals)was(unitals) dirty.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zhitnik wore an angel face Tuesday and seemed
thoroughly unimpressed with his notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can take anything,'' he said after a light workout at the
Sabres' suburban practice arena in Amherst. ``The hit looked pretty
bad, but it wasn't intentional. It's playoff hockey, so we can
expect anything. I'm just going to go out and try to play hockey,
take some body. I play rough hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering that that's the nature of the playoffs, his
teammates couldn't understand what the fuss was about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not talk about the hit on Kruse?'' said disgusted Buffalo
captain Michael Peca, referring to Bruin muscleman Ken
Baumgartner's stickwork on Paul Kruse at 8:34 of the second period
Sunday that put the Buffalo left wing on the bench in a state of
suspended animation. ``Why don't they comment on that? Everybody
chooses to focus on what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres readily acknowledge that their focus is on Bourque,
but it's hardly an original concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the focal point of every playoff series,'' said coach
Lindy Ruff. ``Every team wants to finish him. And he just keeps
going, seldom gets injured. But you've got to keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   While steadfastly championing Zhitnik's innocence _ echoing his
player's claim that Bourque turned in to the check and that the hit
from behind was unintentional _ Ruff was unconcerned that his top
defenseman has emerged as the major villain from the Bruins'
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll want to finish him off,'' said the coach, ``but I
don't expect they'll want to take any stupid penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhitnik also doubted that a physical series would turn fistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a fighter,'' he said. ``There are no fights in the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   But there can be distractions, and Ruff hopes Zhitnik has become
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see your name in the paper, that the other team's
talking about you,'' he said, ``that means you're doing your job.''
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, Zhitnik pleaded ignorance rather than innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really pay attention to TV talk or newspapers,'' said
the 26-year-old Ukrainian. ``I try to stay away from that stuff.
Nobody said anything about that.''
</P>
<P>
   He might get the message Wednesday. But the Sabres do not fear
for his safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he really cares,'' said Peca.
</P>
<P>
   And even if it reaches the point where he has no choice, said
Ruff, ``I'm not worried at all. Alexei gets fired up. He's got a
nasty side to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Really? The Bruins never would have guessed.

BUSH HAS DOUBTS ABOUT FATE OF HIS SCHOOL VOUCHER PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA TOLLEY  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush expressed some doubt Tuesday
that lawmakers would approve a school voucher program this session,
but he was optimistic that other key parts of his legislative
agenda would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called for the passage of a school voucher pilot program at
the beginning of the legislative session, and the proposal is
strongly supported by Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But with fewer than three weeks to go in the session, Senate
Democrats said they had the votes to keep the bill from being heard
on the floor. The House has not yet approved a voucher plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think there's still a chance that vouchers may have
some life in the Senate ... but I'm not nearly as hopeful about
that particular issue as I would have been at the beginning of the
session,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The program would provide vouchers to parents of children in
poorly performing public schools. The vouchers could be used to
help pay tuition in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Friday is the last day for the House to consider all bills on
third and final reading, but proponents say there may still be an
attempt to approve a limited voucher program. The legislative
session ends May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Although voucher proponents have lobbied hard for the proposal,
Bush said, opponents have been successful in presenting their side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people are afraid that vouchers will hurt public
schools. I disagree,'' he said. ``I think vouchers will help
parents whose children get locked into failed schools. But the
opponents to vouchers have done a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting Children First, an organization that favors vouchers, is
still hopes for passage of some type of proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over until it's over,'' said Chuck McDonald, a
spokesman for the group. ``Obviously, it would take some doing to
pass voucher legislation at this point. ... but there's always a
chance. It's still possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush was more optimistic that lawmakers would deliver
a school property tax cut he could support, even though the Senate
version calls for half the $2 billion in tax relief he is seeking
and the House hasn't even approved a tax-reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like we're in good shape. I think we're going to have
both a teacher pay raise and tax cuts that will be substantial,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is considering a bid for the Republican presidential
nomination, and some political observers believe he wants to emerge
from the session with a sizable tax cut that he can tout on the
campaign trail. But the governor insisted he is only concerned
about Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what's important to Texas that matters to me. We'll worry
about all the (presidential) exploratory business later. Right now,
it's what's best for Texas,'' said Bush, who is expected to travel
to Iowa and New Hampshire next month after the legislative session
ends.

PATRIOTS STADIUM BILL PUT IN THE WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Governor Cellucci unveiled legislation Tuesday to help
the New England Patriots build a new home in Foxborough, and
pledged to work with town officials to expedite the permitting
process so the $225 million stadium could be ready by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The $70 million infrastructure plan is expected to pass with the
necessary two-thirds approval in the House and Senate. Both
branches are scheduled to begin debate on the measure next Tuesday,
one day after a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty good news in terms of the progress of this
bill,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Foxborough residents must also sign off on the stadium
development at a special town meeting that has not yet been set.
The goal: speedy action so that the facility can be ready for play
by 2001, the date he initially targeted in team owner Robert
Kraft's Connecticut stadium deal, which collapsed last month when
the construction timetable appeared in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham, and Cellucci designed the legislation with input from
the NFL last month after years of political struggle that almost
drove the team to move out of state -- twice in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said Tuesday's announcement shows the divisiveness
between the House and Senate on the issue has finally been put to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proved the naysayers wrong. We have proved we can work
together in a bipartisan way to get to `yes,' '' the Chelsea
Democrat said. ``Perhaps we should have won it in regulation. It's
fine to win it in overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the political keloid -- the result of Kraft's
frustration and impatience with Beacon Hill and the Legislature's
polarization over him -- was still visible Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the state's top leaders have spoken to Kraft about
whether the deal is acceptable to him, and the Patriots patriarch
was conspicuously absent from Tuesday's announcement, otherwise
dripping with mutual praise and sports metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   New England Patriots spokesman Stacey James said the team would
withhold comment until after the Legislature votes on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, blamed for blocking a $72 million Senate stadium plan
last year, seemed anxious to put the saga behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the endzone is in sight,'' said Finneran. ``And it's
a good story to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci stumbled when asked why no one on Beacon Hill has
spoken to Kraft directly since the franchise owner walked away from
a proposal to build a $374 million publicly financed stadium in
Hartford. Before Kraft's April 30 decision to pull out of the
Connecticut deal, he was not allowed to negotiate with another
state without penalty. He can now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did leave a message with him that I was very pleased,''
Cellucci said, referring to a call to Kraft 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the NFL were included in the talks to
finalize this latest plan, but not even they were supposed to speak
with Kraft about the negotiations while he was still engaged to the
Hartford agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The league has since apprised Kraft of the details and the team
has publicly committed to staying in Foxborough. Part of the deal
would have the NFL financing a portion of the $225 million stadium,
to be built next door to the current facility.
</P>
<P>
   The town, which owns the footprint of land beneath Foxboro
Stadium, would give up that property, but become the new owner of
the footprint beneath the replacement structure, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Foxborough Industrial Development Corp., a quasi-public
agency, would issue the 25-year bonds backed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The bill:
</P>
<P>
   -- Requires the team to pay the state $1 million a year, plus
taps satellite parking lots for another $400,000, for the life of
the $70 million in bonds for sewer, road, and utility service
upgrades along Route 1.
</P>
<P>
   -- Allows the team to decide just how to generate cash for $1
million of the yearly payment to the state. This point was
purposely left vague because Cellucci's anti-tax stance made him
skiddish about imposing a stadium-related tax or fee.
</P>
<P>
   -- Includes a ``recapture'' clause should the Patriots decide to
leave Foxborough after the public sector invests in the area. Under
this provision, Kraft would have to pay back all of the debt
service the state incurred up to the time he decides to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's some legitimate grounding of the franchise,''
Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.4 million so-called revenue stream from the Patriots
would essentially cover the state's annual financing costs, an idea
the NFL did not like because they feared it would set a precedent
with other states contemplating new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league was never comfortable...until we made it clear this
was going to be the best deal they'd get,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran held up a Senate plan last year that would have
provided $52 million for infrastructure and $20 million for land
the state would purchase and lease back to Kraft. The speaker said
public investment in private land was against his principles.
</P>
<P>
   What changed?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of a fresh idea Finneran was willing to accept
saying the team would grant the state an easement to make access
and sewer line improvements on their property.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of a second chance -- this time for being a
hero -- may have also played a part for the Mattapan Democrat, the
subject of much bashing on sports radio over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Looking stern, Finneran later added, ``I don't get euphoric over
these things.''

BRUINS FOCUSED ON GETTING THE WIN, BELANGER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The posturing is over, the strategy has been set.
Wednesday night, after much talk, it will be time to play. The
Bruins are planning to go after the Buffalo Sabres early and often
in Game 3 at Marine Midland Arena, but don't misunderstand.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no retaliation for Alexei Zhitnik's nasty hit on
Bruins captain Ray Bourque. There will be no vigilante antics, no
payback.
</P>
<P>
   With enforcer Ken Baumgartner sidelined, left wing Ken Belanger
said he in no way feels obligated to mix it up with any Sabres. He
and his teammates will finish their checks, keep their heads on
their shoulders, and do their best to gain the ulimate revenge _
win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the media making a war out of it, it's not the
players,'' said Belanger. ``It's a game we play, it's a physical
game. Checks happen. Obviously, it wasn't a clean check. You don't
like to see it happen. We finish our hits just as hard. It's all
the newspapers making wars back and forth. We can't be focused on
that, we have to be focused on winning the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger said if he were to go out there with an eye on settling
things with Zhitnik, it would be one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get a five-minute major for fighting and he won't fight,
that's no secret,'' he said. ``It's one of those plays where maybe
next year you take a liberty and take a run at him. Right now, you
can't. It's not even an issue. They hit our good players, we have
to hit their good players. That's how it works. We're going in
there with a new attitude. We're going in there to win two games
and that's what our frame of mind is.''
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Rob DiMaio, another of the Bruins' more gritty
players, said they weren't given an edict by coach Pat Burns to not
retaliate. The coach didn't have to say that. With so much riding
on the next two games, DiMaio said it's a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to tell us to be smart, he's going to tell us to be
disciplined and sometimes you have to turn the other cheek but I've
never heard the word, `don't' come out of his mouth,'' said DiMaio.
``I think we're all knowledgeable enough to understand the
importance of games and the importance of taking a bad penalty and
how it can hurt your hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaio said the good thing is they all have long memories, so if
they have to wait to send a message to Zhitnik about his style of
play, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things will take care of themselves when it's time to
take care of them,'' he said. ``Even if it's not this series, we've
got next year. These things aren't forgotten. Sometimes you have to
bite your tongue. As hard as that is to do, and it's very hard,
there's a right time of the game to do it and you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's an area of concern for the Bruins, it's not the
physical play of the Sabres. It's the poor start the team had in
Game 2. Boston's play was awful and the Sabres jumped on the Bruins
right out of the gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd better be ready,'' said DiMaio. ``They're going to be
coming out very hard and we have to match that. We have to be
prepared ourselves. There's physical and there's stupidity and we
have to be smart. We're going in there with the idea we have to
win. We have to start well and I think we have a good opportunity
if we play the style we know we can play. We know what to expect
from them. I don't think they're sure what to expect from us right
now, which could be to our advantage. We really have to come out
with a lot of intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Goaltender Byron Dafoe said the team desperately wants to avoid
a repeat of Game 2's first period and that they're going to have to
play with a sense of urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take it to them, we want to turn this series
around,'' said Dafoe. ``Throughout the season, they pretty much
dominated us. They don't know what we can really play like as we
played in the first round or even at the end of the season. There's
going to be extra emotion obviously because of what happened in
Game 2. We just have to keep in control and play our game.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he thought it was actually good for the Bruins to go
out on the road, where the club has played well except, of course,
in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've heard the last couple of days has been
negative,'' said Burns. ``I think we'll probably take a lot of
emotion into that. We've got a good challenge on the table right
now and I think the players will take it.''

SWEENEY DEFENSIVE MINDED, DESPITE GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He went five years between Stanley Cup playoff goals
and now he has two in five games.
</P>
<P>
   And that's as many as he had in 81 games during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get excited, folks.
</P>
<P>
   Don Sweeney isn't.
</P>
<P>
   He knows his role, and knows, too, that if he's going to help
carry the Bruins deep into the playoffs, it's going to be because
of his defense, not his offense.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he does best and that's what he did very well in the
six-game conquest of Carolina and in the first two games against
Buffalo. He couldn't have picked a better time to step it up a
notch.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to Tim Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's (Sweeney) playing some great hockey right now and we
really need that, especially at playoff time. That's what you need
from a defenseman and he's brought that to the table. Not just in a
couple of games, but in every game. The goals have been a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   And listen to Hal Gill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been playing unreal. I haven't seen him play this well in
a long time. He's been an impact player for us in the playoffs.
He's picked his spots. He's been huge.''
</P>
<P>
   And listen, too, to coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part he goes unnoticed, but he's doing the job
and when you need him to step up and make the big play, he's
there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a solid postseason for the 11-year veteran, now 32,
who in eight games has logged an average of 23-plus minutes and has
delivered his share of thundering hits. And let's not forget the
two goals, in Game 4 against Carolina and Game 2 against Buffalo.
Both were big.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, though, prefers not to dwell on his play.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point in time, I mean, you can sit back at the end of
the year and look in the mirror and analyze all you want how you
played, but let's be honest. It takes four wins to win a series and
everybody's involved in that and everybody has to play their roles
in order to accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take 20 guys each and every night. You have
injuries and you have to look at your depth. You have to bring to
the table what you bring as an individual and collectively and hope
that it's good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney says he has no illusions about what's expected of him.
He knows it isn't for him to score goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take more chances during the regular season, you can
probably score more goals,'' he said. ``Raymond (Bourque) could
have more points. It's hard to believe that, but he could if he
didn't take care of his own end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my role is on this hockey club. I'm not a
power-play guy. We're a team that's a transition team. We're not a
team that scores a lot of end-to-end goals. I'm going to provide
what I need to provide for this hockey club to be successful.
That's to be steady and to contribute every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, along with some of his veteran teammates, has preached
to the youngsters about what it's like to be playing hockey in
mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what it's all about,'' he said. ``I hadn't even played
in the playoffs the last two years, due to injuries last year, and
we missed them the year before. I was very eager to get going
against Carolina. It doesn't get any better than the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had guys in here that tasted a first-round victory and
that's something they hadn't done before. We have to let them know
that it only gets harder from here on in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to them and told them that you don't always have
opportunities, that they slide by. When they present themselves,
you have to grab hold of them like they're the most precious thing
going. Take advantage of the situation that's in front of you.
Don't wait because you're 19 or 21 years old and say, `Well, maybe
next year, I'm going to get better next year.' It just doesn't work
that way. You need to realize what's in front of you and grab that
brass ring while you can.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he adds, ``Now is as good a time as any.''

PATRIOTS STADIUM BILL PUT IN THE WORKS

<P>
   BOSTON -- Governor Cellucci unveiled legislation Tuesday to help
the New England Patriots build a new home in Foxborough, and
pledged to work with town officials to expedite the permitting
process so the $225 million stadium could be ready by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The $70 million infrastructure plan is expected to pass with the
necessary two-thirds approval in the House and Senate. Both
branches are scheduled to begin debate on the measure next Tuesday,
one day after a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty good news in terms of the progress of this
bill,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Foxborough residents must also sign off on the stadium
development at a special town meeting that has not yet been set.
The goal: speedy action so that the facility can be ready for play
by 2001, the date he initially targeted in team owner Robert
Kraft's Connecticut stadium deal, which collapsed last month when
the construction timetable appeared in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, Senate President Thomas F.
Birmingham, and Cellucci designed the legislation with input from
the NFL last month after years of political struggle that almost
drove the team to move out of state -- twice in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   Birmingham said Tuesday's announcement shows the divisiveness
between the House and Senate on the issue has finally been put to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have proved the naysayers wrong. We have proved we can work
together in a bipartisan way to get to `yes,' '' the Chelsea
Democrat said. ``Perhaps we should have won it in regulation. It's
fine to win it in overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the political keloid -- the result of Kraft's
frustration and impatience with Beacon Hill and the Legislature's
polarization over him -- was still visible Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the state's top leaders have spoken to Kraft about
whether the deal is acceptable to him, and the Patriots patriarch
was conspicuously absent from Tuesday's announcement, otherwise
dripping with mutual praise and sports metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   New England Patriots spokesman Stacey James said the team would
withhold comment until after the Legislature votes on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran, blamed for blocking a $72 million Senate stadium plan
last year, seemed anxious to put the saga behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the endzone is in sight,'' said Finneran. ``And it's
a good story to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci stumbled when asked why no one on Beacon Hill has
spoken to Kraft directly since the franchise owner walked away from
a proposal to build a $374 million publicly financed stadium in
Hartford. Before Kraft's April 30 decision to pull out of the
Connecticut deal, he was not allowed to negotiate with another
state without penalty. He can now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did leave a message with him that I was very pleased,''
Cellucci said, referring to a call to Kraft 10 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the NFL were included in the talks to
finalize this latest plan, but not even they were supposed to speak
with Kraft about the negotiations while he was still engaged to the
Hartford agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The league has since apprised Kraft of the details and the team
has publicly committed to staying in Foxborough. Part of the deal
would have the NFL financing a portion of the $225 million stadium,
to be built next door to the current facility.
</P>
<P>
   The town, which owns the footprint of land beneath Foxboro
Stadium, would give up that property, but become the new owner of
the footprint beneath the replacement structure, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Foxborough Industrial Development Corp., a quasi-public
agency, would issue the 25-year bonds backed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The bill:
</P>
<P>
   -- Requires the team to pay the state $1 million a year, plus
taps satellite parking lots for another $400,000, for the life of
the $70 million in bonds for sewer, road, and utility service
upgrades along Route 1.
</P>
<P>
   -- Allows the team to decide just how to generate cash for $1
million of the yearly payment to the state. This point was
purposely left vague because Cellucci's anti-tax stance made him
skiddish about imposing a stadium-related tax or fee.
</P>
<P>
   -- Includes a ``recapture'' clause should the Patriots decide to
leave Foxborough after the public sector invests in the area. Under
this provision, Kraft would have to pay back all of the debt
service the state incurred up to the time he decides to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there's some legitimate grounding of the franchise,''
Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.4 million so-called revenue stream from the Patriots
would essentially cover the state's annual financing costs, an idea
the NFL did not like because they feared it would set a precedent
with other states contemplating new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league was never comfortable...until we made it clear this
was going to be the best deal they'd get,'' Finneran said.
</P>
<P>
   Finneran held up a Senate plan last year that would have
provided $52 million for infrastructure and $20 million for land
the state would purchase and lease back to Kraft. The speaker said
public investment in private land was against his principles.
</P>
<P>
   What changed?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of a fresh idea Finneran was willing to accept
saying the team would grant the state an easement to make access
and sewer line improvements on their property.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospect of a second chance -- this time for being a
hero -- may have also played a part for the Mattapan Democrat, the
subject of much bashing on sports radio over the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Looking stern, Finneran later added, ``I don't get euphoric over
these things.''

ISRAELI COURT LETS PALESTINIAN OFFICES REMAIN OPEN UNTIL AFTER
ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-POLITICS) 
(rk) 
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Supreme Court on Tuesday barred the
government from closing three offices at the Palestinian political
headquarters in East Jerusalem, easing a crisis that had threatened
to erupt in violence less than a week before the Israeli election.
</P>
<P>
   The court order was a political blow to Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, who pressed for the closing as part of a re-election
campaign in which he has made Israel's control of Jerusalem a
rallying cry.
</P>
<P>
   Faisal al-Husseini, the top Palestinian leader in East
Jerusalem, emerged strengthened, riding a wave of popular support
as Palestinians rallied around the headquarters, known as Orient
House, which they consider a symbol of their claims to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling removed a looming threat of violence after
the police served orders to close the three offices on Monday night
and Palestinians gathered there to block entry by the security
forces.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu's Cabinet authorized the closings, asserting that the
offices _ a maps department that monitors Israeli settlement
activity, a liaison office with foreign diplomats, and Husseini's
office _ were linked to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Israeli-Palestinian interim self-rule accords, the
authority cannot operate in Jerusalem. The city's future is to be
decided in talks on a final peace agreement _ talks that were
supposed to have been completed by May 4, but have barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials and Israeli intelligence chiefs warned
that a forcible police entry to Orient House, the Jerusalem
headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization, was likely
to cause bloodshed and set off riots. American diplomats tried to
mediate the dispute, and the State Department urged restraint.
</P>
<P>
   Confrontation was averted Tuesday by Israeli peace advocates
from Jerusalem. They petitioned the Supreme Court, arguing that
Netanyahu's decision to close the offices was tainted with
``electoral considerations.'' They asked for an order barring the
closing until after the May 17 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister is creating an event,'' said Daniel
Seidemann, the lawyer who filed the petition, ``a photo opportunity
that on the following day will appear in his television ads, and
this affects the lives and deaths of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Dalia Dorner ruled that the offices could not be closed
until a further court decision. She gave Husseini and his
colleagues a week to submit their response, deferring the case
until after the election on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu responded: ``We are determined to close these offices,
which challenge our sovereignty in Jerusalem, but we are determined
to do so in accordance with the directives of the judiciary system,
carefully and responsibly. We have no intention of inflaming the
area. I'm doing what a prime minister must do, ensuring our
sovereignty in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   At Orient House, Palestinians celebrated victory, shooting off
fireworks, dancing and chanting slogans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a victory over anyone,'' said Husseini, who was
given a hero's welcome by his supporters. ``This is a victory for
peace, for peace-loving people not only in Palestine, but in Israel
and all over the world.''

BOMBING, END KOSOVO CRISIS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia's envoy to the Balkans said he would propose
new ideas when he meets Wednesday in Moscow with U.S. diplomat
Strobe Talbott over ways to bring peace to Yugoslavia's embattled
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a potential stumbling block for the United States and its
allies, however, China locked arms with Russia in demanding an
immediate halt to the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia, NATO
wound up its seventh inconclusive week with fresh attacks early
Wednesday.(CQ)
</P>
<P>
   In another troubling sign for the alliance, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin denounced NATO's mistaken attack on China's embassy in
Belgrade last Friday as ``a provocation to all 1.2 billion Chinese
people,'' as Beijing formally scratched a broad array of high-level
military and diplomatic meetings it had scheduled with U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang made the remarks hours before the remains of the three
Chinese killed in the bombing were scheduled to arrive in Beijing,
where anti-American protests were expected to roll into a fifth day
on Wednesday, rekindled by the emotion-wrought return of the
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton searched for ways to smooth the roiled
waters between the United States and the world's most populous
country, Jiang continued to snub the White House, refusing to speak
to Clinton over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin insisted that Clinton had
not yet tried to use a special hot line set up two years ago to
head off prickly problems between Washington and Beijing. The
issue, he said, is not finding a phone, but rather getting Jiang to
answer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hot line or a telephone has to have two people on both sides
of the phone,'' Rubin said. ``We're clearly indicating our
willingness to talk to them on the phone . . . They've chosen,
obviously, that they are not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has apologized for the inadvertent attack twice in
public and once in a letter to Jiang. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright hand-carried a letter of apology to the Chinese Embassy in
Washington last Saturday, the morning after the ill-fated attack.
</P>
<P>
   China's state-run media didn't broadcast or publish news of the
apologies, however, until Tuesday, sparking some here to wonder
whether the Chinese government -- or some faction of it -- might be
feeding anti-American sentiment across a country that takes in
one-fifth of the world's population.
</P>
<P>
   China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, denied that,
calling the protests ``overreactions,'' and saying suggestions that
the demonstrators were backed by Beijing amounted to ``a
misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   In his first public remarks on the issue, however, Jiang added
to the confusion, praising the demonstrators as the banner carriers
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few days, the Chinese people have used protests,
meetings, statements and all sorts of methods to express their
utmost indignation,'' Jiang told Russia's envoy to the Balkans,
Victor Chernomyrdin, during a meeting in Beijing Tuesday. ``It
shows the fervor, will and strength of the great patriotic spirit
of the Chinese people,'' Jiang said, according to state-run news
agencies in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   China formally notified the United States that it was suspending
a series of high-level meetings that had been scheduled for later
this month and next on subjects ranging from human rights and
nuclear weapons proliferation to security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Also in jeopardy are talks that have gone on for years aimed at
economic and trade reforms that would enable China to qualify for
membership in the World Trade Organization -- a step deemed
critical to the furtherance of U.S.-Chinese commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
   Also at risk was a planned trip next month to Beijing by Defense
Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin, Russia's former premier, left Beijing for Moscow,
where he arrived late Tuesday in preparation for his meeting with
Talbott, deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before everything else, it is essential that NATO stop its
strikes against Yugoslavia,'' Chernomyrdin told reporters, echoing
the view China has also expressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Chernomyrdin said, ``is an important condition for
peace talks.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO ignored the plea, pressing its air campaign into its 50th
day with fresh attacks across Yugoslavia early Wednesday(CQ), and
U.S. and allied officials vowed the strikes would escalate further
in the days and weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO's air campaign will continue until atrocities in Kosovo
have ceased, all Yugoslav security forces have left Kosovo, and
there is agreement on an international security presence that will
allow refugees to return to the region in safety,'' Albright said
in a message taped for release across Yugoslavia's main state of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The address was to be beamed by radio into Serbia as part of a
larger U.S. effort to counter state-controlled media in Belgrade,
which has yet to notify the public of military repression that the
United States estimates has left more than 4,600 ethnic Albanians
dead and perhaps 1.5 million homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this conflict is over, good and decent Serbs will be
appalled at what has been done in your name. You did not shoot sons
in front of their mothers, chase families into minefields, or
select out young women to be raped,'' Albright said. `` But the
world knows that your military,
</P>
<P>
   paramilitary and police forces are doing all of these things in
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin insisted that the souring of Sino-American relations and
Beijing's growing link with Moscow over the issue would not affect
the air campaign nor impede the search for a diplomatic end to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that this will have any significant effect
on the conduct of our military operation or the pace of the
diplomatic track,'' Rubin told reporters at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The striking union of Moscow and Beijing, however, raised the
geopolitical stakes in the Kosovo conflict. China and Russia are
among the five permanent members of the United Nations Security
Council, along with the United States, Britain and France.
</P>
<P>
   Each one has veto power that can block Security Council
resolutions, such as the one the United States and its NATO allies
are seeking to endorse a plan for setting up an international
protectorate in Kosovo and policing it with a NATO-led peacekeeping
force.
</P>
<P>
   Russia agreed, in a very general sense, to that plan last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The Talbott-Chernomyrdin meeting on Wednesday is a day-long
working session aimed at putting flesh on the bones of that
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said it was unlikely that China would block any accord --
or the Security Council resolution endorsing it -- that might be
reached between Russia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that China will at the end of the day stand
in the way of an agreement that could be struck by Russia based on
NATO's five conditions,'' said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  an end to hostilities inside Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the acceptance by Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, of an international peacekeeping force with NATO at its
core to police the peace in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  guaranteed safe return of ethnic Albanian refugees;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and political autonomy -- but not independence -- for Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also raised the possibility that Finland's president,
Martti Ahtisaari, might soon travel on a diplomatic mission,
perhaps to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to rule that out,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott is to fly to Helsinki Wednesday night for a Thursday
meeting with Ahtisaari, a former U.N. representative with extensive
experience in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's prepared to play a role as appropriate, and we
want to discuss with him, as we discuss with others, various ways
in which to achieve our diplomatic objective,'' Rubin said. ``He's
someone who we have a lot of respect for and we want to stay in
close touch with and seek his advice on this subject.''

<P>
   ``We don't believe that China will at the end of the day stand
in the way of an agreement that could be struck by Russia based on
NATO's five conditions,'' said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Those conditions are:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  an end to hostilities inside Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the acceptance by Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, of an international peacekeeping force with NATO at its
core to police the peace in Kosovo;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  guaranteed safe return of ethnic Albanian refugees;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and political autonomy -- but not independence -- for Kosovo's
ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin also raised the possibility that Finland's president,
Martti Ahtisaari, might soon travel on a diplomatic mission,
perhaps to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to rule that out,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott is to fly to Helsinki Wednesday night for a Thursday
meeting with Ahtisaari, a former U.N. representative with extensive
experience in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's prepared to play a role as appropriate, and we
want to discuss with him, as we discuss with others, various ways
in which to achieve our diplomatic objective,'' Rubin said. ``He's
someone who we have a lot of respect for and we want to stay in
close touch with and seek his advice on this subject.''

MARKET PLACE: LAND OF THE RISING STOCK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japan's economy may be dead in the water, but the nation is once
again the land of the rising stock market. The question is, when
will the world's second- largest economy begin to justify
investors' increasingly high hopes?
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index is up 20.96
percent in yen terms, beating even the Dow Jones industrial
average. Anyone who invested in the Nikkei in dollars has a 13.58
percent gain for the year. Shares of small companies have jumped
along with the big blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing share prices higher is the consensus view among
economists that the worst is over for Japan. Last year, the
nation's gross domestic product declined 2.8 percent. Economists
expect output to shrink only 1.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, responsible for 20 percent of the world's production of
goods, has been mired in its deepest recession since the end of
World War II. While some numbers and anecdotal information out of
Japan very recently have seemed positive _ consumer spending has
stopped dropping, automobile sales have risen a bit _ real evidence
of a rebound is scanty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passage of the bank reform legislation last fall and the
extra fiscal stimulus gave people confidence,'' said Carl Weinberg,
chief economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y. ``But
investors' expectations for the timetable are too optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   This optimism is evident in the buckets of money pouring into
Japanese stocks. According to Robert Adler, president of AMG Data
Services, money flowing into mutual funds that invest in Japanese
equities has exceeded that going into any foreign market in recent
weeks. On Feb. 24, assets in Japanese equity funds totaled $1.73
billion, but have since risen to $3.02 billion, a 75 percent
increase. Only a small portion of that increase comes from market
gains as the Nikkei 225 has risen 20.5 percent in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past month, some $77 billion a week has gone into
Japanese equity funds. ``Japanese inflows are the heaviest they've
been since June 1997,'' Adler said. ``Then, a nine-consecutive-week
period with relatively heavy flows was brought to a screeching halt
by the Thai baht collapse. Outflows started and investor sentiment
hasn't recovered until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those putting money into Japan are doing so in the
belief that the economy is about to turn up. Others are probably
trend-followers, jumping into whatever investment is the top
performer of late. Since Japanese equity funds topped the
performance lists for international mutual funds offered by U.S.
fund companies in the first quarter of 1999, they have attracted
even more attention. And now that interest rates on Japan's
government bonds have dropped to 1.32 percent, Japanese investors
appear to be edging into stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock markets can be wrong,'' said Robert Parks, professor of
finance at the Lubin Graduate School of Business at Pace
University. Parks believes that investors are mistaking low
interest rates in Japan _ money market rates are close to zero _ as
evidence of relatively easy monetary policy, an approach that would
turn the economy around. ``But low interest rates are not evidence
of fiscal monetary stimulation, they are evidence of a collapsing
economy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, through March 31, tax revenues were down 7.1 percent,
consumer prices had fallen 3.9 percent, and residential land values
in Tokyo had declined 1 percent. Weinberg expects corporate
earnings to disappoint and the nation's output for 1999 to be down
much more sharply than the 1.5 percent decline most economists are
projecting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most closely watched figures out of Japan is the
so-called bank lending number, a report of lending activities from
19 city banks, due out late Thursday. A rise in lending, which has
been falling for almost two years, would be a harbinger of an
improved economy, Weinberg said. But he suspects lending is still
on the downswing. In March, bank lending fell 3.6 percent from a
year earlier; his forecast for April is a 4.1 percent drop from the
1998 period.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberg said that GDP growth doesn't usually show up until
three to four quarters after money and credit have begun to expand.
``That means that at the soonest it will be the first quarter of
2000 before meaningful economic expansion takes place,'' he said.
``And for that to happen everything has to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   To try to jumpstart their economy, Japanese policy-makers have
cut taxes and increased government spending on public works. But
the spending has been funded by the issuance of government bonds,
the wrong approach according to Parks, because it sops up private
funds that might otherwise go to investment or consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Japan must increase the money supply by rolling the
printing presses, Parks said. Policy-makers are afraid to do this
for fear of pushing the yen down and inflation up. The recent 3.5
percent increase in the broad supply of money in Japan has simply
been the result of consumers shifting money around, not the
creation of new money, an economist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned that Japan's sovereign debt will be downgraded
again if they don't shift their policies,'' Parks said. ``And if
yields on sovereign debt shoot up, what would that mean for credit
demands that have collapsed as it is? Once the economic decline
gains a self-reinforcing momentum, you go right into a
depression.''

GASOLINE ADDITIVE ISN'T CURTAILING SMOG, STUDY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A controversial ingredient several states' gasoline, blamed for
widespread water contamination, does little to reduce summertime
smog as it was intended to, according to a National Research
Council study that may add momentum to growing efforts to eliminate
the additive.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE has been added in large quantities to gasoline since 1995
as part of a recipe change aimed at reducing air pollution in
vehicle exhaust. But, almost immediately, MTBE began seeping into
drinking water supplies, including 53 in Massachusetts so far and
more than 100 each in Maine and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the study by the National Research Council, research arm of
the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the public is getting
only modest air quality improvements from MTBE, called an
oxygenate, in exchange for the threat to water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very very hard for us to see anything significant
coming out of the addition of oxygenates with the exception of a
reduction in carbon monoxides,'' said William Chameides, an
atmospheric scientist at the Georgia Institute of Technology who
chaired the study panel. He made no policy recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   But others cautioned against writing off MTBE, noting that it is
just one ingredient of a broader reformulated gasoline that has
been highly successful at reducing ozone and the other chemicals in
smog. Reducing or eliminating MTBE, which adds octane for vehicle
starting power, could prompt refiners to add other, more toxic
ingredients to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, they pointed out that the most readily available
substitute for MTBE, a corn-derivative called ethanol, may actually
increase smog, according to the same National Research Council
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take home message from this report is we have to be careful
about what we put in gasoline. There is no single magic solution,''
said Daniel Greenbaum, chairman of the US Environmental Protection
Agency's blue ribbon panel investigating oxygenates. ``We need to
get to a place where we continue to get the benefits of
reformulated gas.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council study comes amid mounting concern
from coast to coast about MTBE, one of two oxygenates that the
federal Clean Air Act requires as an ingredient in reformulated
gas. MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, causes cancer in lab
animals and, though its threat to humans is hotly debated, its
paint thinner odor can render water undrinkable.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the state of Maine has ordered MTBE levels sharply
reduced in its gas this summer, while California Gov. Gray Davis
plans to eliminate MTBE entirely by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, state regulators have taken no steps to
curtail MTBE, but the Department of Environmental Protection is
ordering all 1,500 public water suppliers in the state to begin
monitoring for the chemical. At least traces of MTBE have reached
53 public water supplies, requiring the closure of three and
treatment of a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   DEP assistant commissioner Arleen O'Donnell said the state
probably would not decide on MTBE's fate until late this year after
Greenbaum's panel and a New England-wide study of the issue are
closer to completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to avoid this being a water versus air issue and make
this a `what's best for the environment issue?' '' said O'Donnell.
``Over the next six months, we'll have a lot more information to
make an informed decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The doubts now contrast with the hopes in 1995, when
reformulated gas, containing 11 to 14 percent MTBE, was introduced
at gas pumps across southern New England as well as the southern
portions of Maine and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view it as the alternative fuel of the future that is ready
now,'' said Robert Mathey of Mobil, calling reformulated gas ``the
most cost-effective as well as the most environmentally attractive
way to reduce emissions.''
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated gas as a whole has worked much better than
expected, reducing toxic chemicals from tailpipes by 37 percent in
Boston, compared to a predicted 15 to 20 percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But as the National Research Council researchers looked at the
smog-fighting value of reformulated gasoline, they found that
little credit goes to MTBE or to ethanol, the oxygenate of choice
in places such as Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Smog-causing emissions from motor vehicles are declining,
Chameides said, ``but that's largely because of better emissions
control equipment and components of reformulated gasolines, other
than (MTBE or ethanol) that improve air quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Chameides said MTBE does reduce the amount of toxic benzene in
gas, but he said that was partly offset by new toxic chemicals from
burning MTBE. Moreover, he said, refiners can probably produce a
clean-burning gas that doesn't contain either MTBE or significant
benzene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem that there are no air quality benefits exclusive
to oxygenates,'' said Jason Grumet of the Northeast States for
Coordinated Air Use Management, a Boston-based group studying MTBE
for New England's governors. ``It is unquestionably possible to
achieve the ozone benefits, the toxic benefits'' without MTBE or
ethanol.
</P>
<P>
   But Grumet warned that gas prices could jump by 10 cents a
gallon if MTBE were abruptly banned. If regulators allow four or
five years for a transition, he predicted refiners could produce a
reformulated gas without the MTBE threat or a big price hike.

SPORTS COLUMN: GOLDEN BEAR COMES BACK AS A `SOLID 4'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Ohio, Pa.)  (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, N.Y. _ Jack Nicklaus is golf's Golden Bear and Steve
Pedersen, a 37-year-old retired New York City police sergeant, is a
7 handicap, but as they met for the first time Tuesday, they had
something in common: a hip replacement.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Golden Bear was on his way to hitting a ceremonial
tee shot opening the Golf Club at Mansion Ridge here Tuesday, the 7
handicap approached him for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for answering my note,'' Pedersen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for sending it,'' Nicklaus said, signing a Masters
souvenir flag. ``How are you doing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a few pounds over,'' Pedersen said, patting his
tummy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm four or five over,'' Nicklaus said, patting his own tummy.
</P>
<P>
   In about 20 practice rounds since returning from Jan. 27 surgery
on his degenerative left hip, the 59-year-old Jack Nicklaus has
also been four or five over par more often than not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a solid 4 now,'' he said with a smile, alluding to what
his golf handicap would be if he were an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   But when was the last time that the best golfer in history, the
winner of a record 20 major titles, actually had a 4 handicap?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 12,'' he said. ``The next year, I got down to a
plus 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months after his surgery, Nicklaus spoke of
returning to tournament golf May 20 at the Senior PGA Tour's Bell
Atlantic Classic outside Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3 he will rejoin the PGA Tour at his Memorial tournament
at Muirfield Village near Columbus, Ohio, and on June 17 in
Pinehurst, N.C., he will tee off in the U.S. Open Championships for
the 42nd consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to expect too much of myself,'' he said. ``If I
shoot a 78, I shoot a 78.''
</P>
<P>
   When last seen in a tournament, Nicklaus limped to a
five-under-par 67 in the final round of last year's U.S. Senior
Open at Riviera, but he had soared to a 79 the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Hobbled by his ailing hip, he didn't enter last year's British
Open, ending his streak of consecutive major tournament appearances
at 154. He also skipped last year's PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do this operation for golf,'' he has said. ``I did it
for quality of life, so that my wife, Barbara, didn't have to put
up with me having my hip dominating my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend at the Muirfield Village course he designed,
Nicklaus shot 81 on Friday, but on Sunday he had 71, hitting 15
greens in regulation and reaching the fringe of a par 5 in two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a pussycat off the tee and a gorilla around the
greens,'' he said, joking. ``I'm not quite there, but I'm not that
far away.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged being bored by his 10-month layoff from
competition, the longest of his career. After a dismal 1979 season
when he didn't win a tournament, he ``touched the clubs three
times'' from after that year's PGA Championship to January.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that next year,'' he remembered, ``I had one of the best
years I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   That year he won both the U.S. Open at Baltusrol and the PGA at
Oak Hill outside Rochester, one of six years in which he won two
majors. Not that he intends to be a regular on the PGA Tour or the
Senior PGA Tour now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to turn around and be a golfer again just
because I had hip surgery,'' he said. ``I've got other things to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   What he mostly does now is design golf courses. And now, up on
the first tee at Mansion Ridge, a hilly 6,889-yard course here in
Orange County and the first Jack Nicklaus-signature layout in New
York state, he was about to formally open the 172nd course he has
designed, co-designed or redesigned in 26 countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we do here,'' he told the 100 people assembled, ``is hit
the first tee shot. Do I get a mulligan?''
</P>
<P>
   As he slipped his left hand into a white glove, he held a
persimmon driver that will be mounted in the Mansion Ridge
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing this with loafers on,'' he said. ``I don't have my
contacts in. I might not see the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   He took a couple of practice swings, then stepped up and hit the
tee shot, but when the ball veered into a fairway bunker, he took
his mulligan. This time, the ball soared far down the middle of the
fairway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little bit better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Bell Atlantic Classic, the Memorial and the U.S.
Open, not even Jack Nicklaus gets a mulligan.  &QL;

HERE'S HOPING FOR A REAL BABE IN `PHANTOM' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PHOENIX - You don't normally think of Carrie Fisher as a babe.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing wrong with that. She's a good actress. She's a funny
writer (see ``Postcards From the Edge'' for proof). As a bonus, she
was married to Paul Simon for about five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But even in her younger days, she never graced the covers of
magazines with a come-hither look and not much else, like the
ubiquitous Pamela Anderson prior to the removal of her implants.
That just wasn't her role.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was that one bright, shining, fleshy moment when, for
``Star Wars'' fans everywhere, Carrie Fisher became a certified,
card-carrying babe.
</P>
<P>
   You know what I'm talking about. Near the beginning of ``Return
of the Jedi,'' Fisher, as Princess Leia, traded in those stupid
cinnamon-roll hair buns for a swirling metal bikini.
</P>
<P>
   It was a striking sight and about time _ it was the first
instance in any of the ``Star Wars'' movies that a woman was seen
in anything other than a glorified bathrobe. Fisher made enough of
an impression that, nearly 20 years later, she found herself in a
``Friends'' plot, with Ross, Chandler and Joey all admitting they
had lusted after her. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hanging around with Hutt &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But we'll never know if Fisher looked so babealicious only
because she spent most of her time sprawled next to Jabba the Hutt.
You remember Jabba, the enormous intergalactic gangster who looked
like something you might find in the business end of a dirty
handkerchief.
</P>
<P>
   Next to him, Monica Lewinsky would look like Cindy Crawford.
Context is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, there is also the audience to think of. The
babe barometer wasn't set on ``stunning'' for these guys. Your
classic ``Star Wars'' disciple _ the one who quoted Darth Vader
incessantly every time the chess club met and grew up to put a
JEDINI TE vanity plate on his Pacer _ didn't need Farrah Fawcett or
Cheryl Tiegs to get excited. Carrie Fisher or Darla Sue in Spanish
class _ what did it matter? Just another in a string of fantasies
you knew you weren't going to the prom with.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, babes were never the point of the ``Star Wars''
movies. Pseudoreligious nattering fortified with the occasional
science-fiction sword fight was. Girls? Yuck. Dude, get a load of
that lightsaber. (Sorry, Dr. Freud.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Waiting game &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As you probably know _ it's getting more media coverage than the
past three presidential administrations combined _ ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menance'' opens in a week. We still don't
know exactly what three-headed monsters and assorted other cr
eatures we'll see. But enough information is out there to make a
somewhat-educated guess as to whether we'll have to wait until the
third movie of this trilogy to see a babe.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if we won't. Right off the bat there is Queen
Amidala, played by Natalie Portman. She's beautiful enough
certainly. And if you're going to entice the future Darth Vader,
you've got to have something going for you.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, like Leia, she's royalty, with all the modesty
that implies. How many years did it take the ``National Enquirer''
to get shots of Princess Diana in a bathing suit? Plus, in the
publicity photos, Amidala sports a hair helmet that would make Burt
Reynolds wince.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. Did Leia teach us nothing?
</P>
<P>
   Shmi Skywalker, played by Pernilla August, should be a
non-factor. August is an attractive actress, but she's dowdied up
for the movie as you would expect Darth Vader's mother to be.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money is on Oola, a Twi'lek dancer played by Femi
Taylor. According to ``Playboy,'' she appears on-screen for only a
minute or so but makes such an impression in her barely there
costume that she has her own action figure.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Oola's hairdo includes what looks like a pair of wayward
intestines growing out of her head. Not an attractive feature, but
when you compare her look with the rest of the offerings in ``The
Phantom Menace,'' she looks like the best babe candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If not, Darth Maul carries a double-edged lightsaber. The
disciples need something to slobber over. &QL;

RAGE OVER EMBASSY BOMBING ABRUPTLY TRANSFORMS CHINESE CAMPUSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-CHINA) 
(bl) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Exactly 10 years ago, as protesters demonstrated in
Tiananmen Square, a small grassy triangle in the center of Beijing
University became a shrine to democracy, plastered with tracts
about liberty and freedom. In recent years it had become a temple
for the professions, filled with notices about computers and law
examinations.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last four days, the plaza has been transformed anew,
into a museum of frenzied nationalism and anti-American sentiment.
Hundreds of handwritten letters and posters decorate the fence, the
trees and nearby billboards in a vitriolic reaction to the bombing
of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Support Yugoslavia and Resist America,'' one poster read.
``Adolph Clinton,'' another read. A letter suggested that students
should cover the U.S. Embassy with garbage.
</P>
<P>
   A poem read, in part: ``Resist America Beginning with Cola,
Attack McDonald's, Storm KFC.''
</P>
<P>
   University students here led the angry and sometimes violent
protests at the U.S. Embassy over the bombing. With the
authorities' permission, the students have vented a nation's fury.
</P>
<P>
   But even after four days of nearly continuous demonstrations, it
is clear that there remains an extremely deep wellspring of angry
emotion on college campuses that could percolate for months or
years. This emotion, seems to be crystalizing into a burst of angry
nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations have quickly become a formative experience
for college students, who are in some cases making dramatic life
decisions like forgoing overseas study based on their new views.
</P>
<P>
   Many students who cheered Michael Jordan last year and welcomed
President Clinton on his recent visit are lashing out at all things
American.
</P>
<P>
   At People's University on Sunday, several American students were
surrounded by a group of Chinese students who were screaming,
``Blood must be repaid with blood!''
</P>
<P>
   Westerners who were walking on the Beijing University campus
were subject to hard stares and impromptu lectures on imperialism.
Occasional anti-American taunts are tossed out of dormitory
windows.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is a jarring about-face at universities where two
months ago the highest achievement was to obtain a place at an
American graduate school. In some departments at Beijing
University, more than half the students have gone to the United
States after graduation in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   A generation raised on rock music and Coca-Cola is experiencing
a complicated shift. ``Many of my classmate have been going through
their things and planning to burn all American products, at least
those they can do without,'' said a 22-year-old marketing major at
Beijing University, who like many of those interviewed would not
give her full name.
</P>
<P>
   Some students said they worried that rash actions now could
haunt China for years. ``There's is a tone of irrational extremism,
and people aren't thinking clearly about what they think and
write,'' said Yu Jie, a popular liberal essayist who is a graduate
student at the university. ``I think this will have a very bad
effect on the economic, social and cultural development of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Saturday, the universities here have sent busloads of
students to the U.S. Embassy area. On campuses, students talk of
little else, and they have organized accompanying on-campus study
sessions and protest rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I protested because I'm extremely outraged at this trampling
on the dignity of the Chinese people,'' said Chen Wanyi, 20, who
marched last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Although many students opposed the rock throwing that has
battered the embassy, they said they understood why it had
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the protest looked extreme,'' said Lin Yijin, a
trendily dressed 28-year-old journalism student at People's
University, who protested on Saturday and Sunday. ``But I think
compared to what we were responding to, it was pretty restrained,
just bottles and rocks and things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said they believed that the United States had
intentionally bombed the embassy in Belgrade, although few
explained why Washington might have wanted to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike average Chinese, who can see only state-controlled media,
the elite university students generally have Internet access. They
read Clinton's expressions of regret and the NATO explanation, both
of which the students dismissed as unbelievable or inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   At the Beijing University triangle, students have posted a full
English transcript of the NATO news conference in which officials
first explained the bombing. It is covered with comments like
``pure lies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese are furious, and although we've now heard the
apologies, we still feel that the response from NATO and the United
States has been superficial,'' a senior said. ``If you'd seen the
pictures of the three corpses, you'd understand why.''
</P>
<P>
   Although a number of students said they continued to feel
friendly toward the American people, they were keeping their
distance for now. Students said they were boycotting American
products. The usually bustling McDonald's and Pizza Hut restaurants
stood mostly empty Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give up the poison of American-style fast food and cultural
opium _ Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald's, KFC,'' read a poster on the
triangle.
</P>
<P>
   A Dairy Queen store near the protests was closed, and a
Baskin-Robbins store was also closed, hiding its sign under red
cloth and placing banners that said ``Down With Imperialism'' on
its doors.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-American atmosphere is so intense that some students
said they were contemplating whether to continue English classes,
take jobs with U.S. companies or pursue hard-won acceptances to
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Many are clearly torn between the moment's anger and pragmatism.
Some said the protest groups were probably smaller than usual
Tuesday because students were busying cramming for a national
English test Wednesday and standardized tests this weekend that are
required for U.S. graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
   A group of students at the National Minorities University in
Beijing said it wanted to go to Yugoslavia to join the army, and it
has posted fliers on other campuses urging others to join.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of students who strongly support the protests said
the excesses frightened them. ``Are we still in the revolutionary
era?'' an essay posted on a wall at People's University asked.
``Must we answer barbarity with barbarity?''
</P>
<P>
   Jiao Li, 20, a student at the Beijing Transport Technology
College, said: ``I think this is a passing thing when students are
inflamed with patriotism and very emotional. So it's natural for
now to respond by not drinking Coke, for example. But I don't think
that refusing to work for an American firm will solve any
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Students said the anger would fade slowly and only if NATO and
the United States offered acceptable apologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Chinese want is an explanation and an apology that
will restore our dignity'' Lin Yijin said. ``I wouldn't take the
stuff about `Blood for blood' and `Attack NATO' too seriously. For
us, this is about saving face.''

DUVAL-WOODS: MADE FOR TV, AND TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Disregard the dialogue, which could have been scripted by Don
King, and listen to the background noise.
</P>
<P>
   There it is, that persistent squeaking sound. The one that keeps
being drowned out by the voices of Tiger Woods, David Duval and ABC
officials trumpeting an Aug. 2 shootout between the world's
top-ranked golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Do you hear it?
</P>
<P>
   I do, even if PGA Tour officials choose to turn a deaf ear.
That's the sound of Pandora's box. The lid is creaking open, and
anything could come spilling out.
</P>
<P>
   Anything, it seems, except a meaningful meeting between Woods
and Duval at a real, live PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   The two have not played in the same tournament since the Masters
and will not hook up in Fort Worth-Dallas over the next two weeks
despite a combined $5.8 million being laid on the table by
organizers of the GTE Byron Nelson Classic and MasterCard Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Woods will tee up tomorrow in the first round of the
Nelson. Duval will play next week at Colonial. But their paths may
not converge again until the season's next major championship, at
the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Don't blame that on sheer happenstance or bad timing. Look,
instead, at the agency that represents both players: International
Management Group.
</P>
<P>
   It is IMG that is organizing the Aug. 2 exhibition match, the
first of its kind to be telecast live in prime time. It is IMG, in
conjunction with ABC, that stands to reap substantial profits if
this bit of creative programming outperforms summer reruns in its
appointed, Monday time slot.
</P>
<P>
   It is IMG, in short, that benefits by keeping Woods and Duval
apart as much as humanly possible to maximize suspense and ratings
for an IMG-arranged ``shootout.'' Hmmmmm. Ever think ``that'' may
be the reason Duval backed out of the Nelson and Woods will bolt
for Germany during Colonial week?
</P>
<P>
   The PGA Tour has given its blessing to this exhibition, in large
part, because $200,000 of the $1.5 million purse will be donated to
the tour's First Tee Project, which introduces golf to inner-city
youth. Yet in doing so, is the tour cutting its own throat in the
long run?
</P>
<P>
   After charitable contributions are deducted, the winner of the
Woods-Duval shootout will pocket $900,000. By comparison, a golfer
would have to win both the Nelson and Colonial to earn $900,000 at
PGA Tour events in Fort Worth-Dallas this season. And his chances
of doing so would be far less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder, then, that Woods already is pushing for more of
these cushy, IMG-sponsored exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see it become a series, where we could have
more special events like this,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Such a series should make PGA Tour officials squirm. The game's
elite players need more incentive, not less, to play events like
the Nelson and Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Houseman, president of the Salesmanship Club and a
two-time Nelson tournament chairman, foresees the potential for a
day when players build their schedules around a handful of
high-dollar exhibitions, the four majors and the four World Golf
Championship events. Unless forced to do otherwise, elite players
won't have to compete more than 10 times a year at PGA Tour events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that doesn't happen, but the concern is there,''
Houseman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods-Duval exhibition should heighten such concerns. The
lid to Pandora's box is open wider than ever.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON ... Dennis' 3-year-old son already following Tiger
</P>
<P>
   With any luck, Fort Worth resident Clark Dennis will be paired
with Tiger Woods during one of the weekend rounds at the Nelson.
That way, Dennis can get a feel for how he's doing in attempts to
follow the golf advice of his son, Will.
</P>
<P>
   The two were watching a PGA Tour telecast this season when Will
Dennis, 3, asked his flu-stricken father if he had played in the
tournament being shown on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Yeah, I played. But I wasn't feeling good and I
missed the cut,' '' Dennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Unmoved by his father's wheezing and sniffling, the toddler
offered an impromptu pep talk that Dennis has taken to heart
heading into consecutive starts at the Nelson and MasterCard
Colonial (May 20-23).
</P>
<P>
   ``Will stands up, puts his hands on his hips and says, `Dad,
you're supposed to put it in the hole, like Tiger do,' '' Dennis
said. ``I was floored. I didn't even know he knew who Tiger was.
But now, that's my goal for this year: to put it in the hole like
Tiger do.''
CHIP SHOTS
Back for seconds
</P>
<P>
   Paul Earnest, club pro at Four Seasons Resort and Club, is
competing in his second consecutive Nelson, this time by the grace
of a sponsor's exemption. He said lessons learned at the 1998
Nelson and 1998 PGA Championship should help this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having done this before, I think I'll have my emotions better
under control than last year,'' said Earnest, who missed the cut in
both 1998 events. ``That should help me more than anything. I know
I'll have to play well just to make the cut and that's my goal.''
Special exemption
</P>
<P>
   Esteban Toledo fell short of earning a berth in the MasterCard
Colonial by missing the cut at last week's Compaq Classic of New
Orleans and dropping to 92nd on the money list. The top 80 earn
automatic Colonial invitations.
</P>
<P>
   But the former boxer will be competing in Fort Worth because of
a sponsor's exemption, the first he has received at a PGA Tour
event in a career that began in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've written hundreds of letters, asking for them,'' said
Toledo, 36. ``To have someone finally say `yes' ... That tournament
is going to be so special for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo showed his gratitude by volunteering to be host of the
tournament's youth clinic at 4:15 p.m. Tuesday on the club's
driving range.
Colonial Shootout update
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard Colonial officials have received commitments from
seven of 12 golfers who are scheduled to compete in two-man teams
during Tuesday's Colonial Shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmed competitors, said club officials, include Fort Worth
resident Mark Brooks, Davis Love III, Justin Leonard, Jeff Sluman,
Billy Andrade and Tom Watson, the defending Colonial champ. Six
two-man teams will compete on the course's back-nine holes,
beginning at 2 p.m.

HOUSE REPUBLICANS PLEASED WITH HASTERT'S DELIBERATE, LOW-KEY
APPROACH

 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five months after he was tapped as the accidental
speaker, Dennis Hastert has turned out to be just what most House
Republicans want: nearly invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of charging the ideological ramparts like his immediate
predecessor, the electric and polarizing Newt Gingrich, Hastert, a
57-year-old, bear-like former high school wrestling coach, limits
his public appearances mostly to business groups or schools, where
he is prone to bland comments like: ``What we need to do is we need
to listen to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He is praised by House members for keeping his promises,
although they acknowledge that is because he rarely makes any. In a
telling touch Hastert has relegated to extinction the most obvious
symbol of Gingrich's quirky eccentricity _ the replica of a
Tyrannosaurus rex head that had dominated one of the speaker's
conference rooms. A set of portraits of Abraham Lincoln has gone up
in its place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to get back on track,'' Hastert, an Illinois
Republican, said in an interview. ``After the impeachment stuff we
needed to get America's house back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Slumped in a chair, he spoke mordantly for a moment of the
``sobering influence'' on fractious House Republicans of last
November's election losses that allowed them to ``look over the
grave's edge and see their name on the casket.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of bombarding Congress with sweeping new agendas like
Gingrich, Hastert, from Illinois, prefers to stick to the basics
like passing a budget and spending bills on time. He is also
seeking to limit the number of issues that could lead to
destructive divisions among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He is so self-effacing that Democrats in search of a new foil to
replace Gingrich charge that House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, of
Texas, really runs the House. Republicans maintain that DeLay, a
passionate conservative who fueled the impeachment drive against
President Clinton, has a strong influence through his long
friendship with Hastert, who had previously been DeLay's chief
deputy whip. But they say Hastert is charting his own course.
</P>
<P>
   The last American politician who tried to make a virtue out of
``normalcy'' was Warren G. Harding, who did not go down in history
as one of the nation's most notable presidents. It is a sign,
however, of just how chastened and wary the House Republicans are
this session that most praise their new leader precisely for his
low-key solidity.
</P>
<P>
   They call Hastert the right man for a year they describe as a
holding action as they await a presidential nominee to lead the
party. The goal, says Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., who was elected
in the Republican Revolution of 1994, is to ``do no harm.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Hastert is not a lightening rod like Gingrich.
``There's a general feeling in the Republican conference that the
Denny Hastert style is working,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y.
``Not trying to be showboating, not trying to be dramatic, just
being solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Some restless Republicans are starting to wonder whether their
new leader is too low key. They question whether Hastert is willing
to take any risks at all, as he tries to manage the House with one
of the smallest majorities this century. It is a question that
could have a significant bearing on how a host of issues play out,
from an overhaul of the Social Security and Medicare programs, to
tax cutting to revision of the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   And it was underscored by the way the speaker chose to handle a
recent House debate on the war in Yugoslavia, staying silent
through the day-long proceedings as DeLay worked the floor against
a resolution sponsored by Democrats to support the air war. The
measure failed on a 213-213 tie, with Hastert voting at the very
last moment on the losing side. Only 30 other Republicans voted
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has since told Republicans that he made a mistake and
should have voted early to signal his belief that the air war
should be supported.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephart, who hopes to win back the
House in 2000, immediately charged that ``the extreme right wing of
the Republican Party remains in control of that party.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans say they were pleased that Hastert allowed
them to vote as they wished. One House Republican who asked not to
be identified said that the intense dislike for Clinton within the
House GOP caucus had only intensified after the impeachment effort,
and that the majority of Republicans were determined to make Kosovo
``Clinton's war.'' He contended that if Hastert had tried to round
up support for the air war, he ``would have created a rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   And rebellions are what House Republicans are trying to avoid.
``We have a five vote margin,'' Hastert said. ``Any time that you
move five moderates or five conservatives so you don't have them
any more, you can't get anything done.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Hastert still makes it clear that he never wanted to be speaker.
He calls December 19 _ the day he became the consensus replacement
for Robert L. Livingston of Louisiana, the speaker-designee who
resigned after the disclosure that he had had an extramarital
affair _ a ``day of infamy.'' Asked if he has come to like his
position of power, he said tartly, ``I'm reserving judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Because Hastert had served as DeLay's chief deputy before
becoming speaker, some questioned how independent he would be of
the hard-driving whip who helped push the impeachment effort. But
even moderate Republicans who dislike DeLay's politics say DeLay is
not in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If DeLay has some vehement opposition, it slows the process
down and you have to work to convince the speaker,'' said one House
member who did not want to be identified. ``But he has gone his own
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, for example, was the one who made the decision to go
ahead with the Kosovo debate. Senior Republican aides said DeLay
had thought the party would be better off avoiding a debate and
allowing Clinton alone to be responsible for how the war comes out.
Delay also would hold off any vote on campaign finance as long as
possible, whereas Hastert is listening to moderate Republicans who
want a quick vote.
</P>
<P>
   Of his relationship with DeLay, Hastert said, ``We've been
fairly close. My nature is different from him. Tom is kind of
energetic and knee-jerk on a lot of things, and I'm a little more
laid-back and at least outside, of a little calmer countenance.''
</P>
<P>
   He said they can be candid with each other and discuss issues,
``but you know, I'm going to do what I think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides his staff and leadership team, Hastert also relies on a
kitchen cabinet of advisers. Among them, aides say, are Daniel J.
Matoon, a lobbyist for BellSouth; Bill Pitts, a lobbyist for Walt
Disney who was once a senior aide to Robert Michel of Illinois, the
Republican minority leader in the Bush administration; Rep. Thomas
W. Ewing , a fellow Illinois Republican; and Bill Paxon, a former
congressman from upstate New York now with the powerhouse
Washington law and lobbying firm, Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP;
Feld.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say Hastert is a listener. He often checks out the
House floor so that he is easily approachable. He goes to informal
gatherings of House members like the Thursday prayer breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   When bills come to the floor, Hastert allows House members to
make far more attempts to amend them than was common under
Gingrich. That allows them to see if they really have any support
for their positions and to blow off steam. He has also tried to
keep the agenda as free as he can of anything that can split
Republicans _ such as a Social Security overhaul which he says he
will only consider if there is a bipartisan agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's going to do everything in his power to minimize
the number of bills that divide moderates from conservatives,''
said one House Republican who did not want to be identified. ``The
key is to get some solid _ but very few _ accomplishments to get us
beyond the label of a do-nothing Congress and keep us united.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has focused most intensely on a few basics. For only the
second time in 20 years, the House and Senate enacted a budget on
time by April 15. Republicans also passed a bill to give states
more flexibility in using federal education funds, which they
believe will help them fend off Democratic attacks on education.
They hope to unify around a tax cut plan this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some Republicans _ and certainly the Democrats _ are
starting to bristle at the minimalist agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans are weighing whether to go around the
speaker and work with Democrats to try to force a campaign finance
bill to the floor through a special discharge petition.
</P>
<P>
   And Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said he would like to see his party
become more aggressive on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we have to fill the next 12 months before the
nominees are up and running with some substance,'' he said.
``Social Security and Medicare are the two primary issues most
American are anxious to have discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert continues to juggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to return a Republican majority,'' he said. ``I'm
going to do the best job I can day in and day out and let the chips
fall.''

CHINESE LEADERS MEET WITH MOSCOW ENVOY; PROTESTS START TO SHRINK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Russia's special envoy on the Kosovo crisis, Victor
Chernomyrdin, met with China's top leaders to discuss the issue
Tuesday as rage continued to boil here in response to the
accidental NATO attack on the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China have been the strongest international critics
of the NATO bombing campaign in Yugoslavia, and they are seeking to
develop closer ties overall.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief news conference Tuesday, Chernomyrdin said the two
countries agreed that talks in the United Nations to create an
international intervention force for Kosovo must be preceded by a
halt to the bombing _ a precondition that NATO has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that first it is necessary to stop the bombing and
then to conduct negotiations,'' Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia is also anxious to play the role of peacemaker, and
hopes to advance the proposal it worked out with the top seven
industrial nations last week in which an armed force under United
Nations auspices would enter Kosovo as Yugoslav troops withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   One goal of the Russian envoy, who met in Beijing with President
Jiang Zemin, Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and Deputy Prime Minister
Qian Qichen, appeared to be to gain China's support for the general
approach of the so-called Group of Eight plan. As a permanent
member of the Security Council, China will have to agree to the
creation of any U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin hinted at progress toward at least this goal. ``The
Chinese side is studying the proposals of the Group of Eight,'' he
said. ``They agree that the decision by the Group of Eight could be
the basis for future negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chinese accounts of the meetings did not mention the Group
of Eight plan by name, only emphasizing China's demand for an
immediate halt to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders met, noisy demonstrations in another part of
Beijing continued to paralyze the U.S. Embassy. By government order
to universities and other state-run institutions, affected people
say, the huge demonstrations of previous days have been greatly
scaled back.
</P>
<P>
   But still, every half hour or so during daylight hours Tuesday,
approved student groups, often joined by hangers-on, were being
guided by the police past the British and U.S. Embassies, where the
marchers chant slogans such as ``Down with Clinton'' and ``We Want
a Full Apology.''
</P>
<P>
   The television and newspapers finally reported Tuesday that
President Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other
NATO leaders had apologized for the embassy bombing. But many
people here described the gestures as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, National Security Council spokesman David Leavy
said Tuesday that the White House was preparing a letter for the
Chinese government explaining in detail how the United States
mistakenly hit the embassy in Belgrade. The document is expected to
be sent to Beijing within 48 hours, Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the letter would essentially restate the explanation
provided by the Pentagon on Monday that attributed the bombing to
``institutional error'' of those drawing up targeting maps for air
strikes _ as opposed to human error or mechanical failure. The
document will assure the Chinese that the attack was a mistake and
will not happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese certainly deserve to hear what happened, just as
the American people do,'' Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing on Tuesday, along the route to the U.S. Embassy,
plastic sheeting was used to protect the concrete blocks of the
sidewalk, which protesters had been cracking up to make their
projectiles. Tuesday afternoon, as a contingent of 300 from the
Medical University approached the embassy, police shouted, ``Throw
down your rocks'' and took several out of protester's hands.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of this and other groups still smuggled rocks by,
though, and the already shattered and paint-spattered facade of the
embassy was repeatedly pummeled.
</P>
<P>
   After dark, the time of the most violent protests in previous
days, the police did not allow any demonstrators to enter the
embassy district. When one impatient crowd tried to charge past the
police, a few leaders were detained, and witnesses saw at least one
of them being beaten and kicked by the police.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador James Sasser, along with two other diplomats,
eight marines and two security officers, remained holed up in the
embassy, where they have been since Saturday. Although conditions
appeared less dangerous, the ambassador has declared he will not
leave until it is clearly safe to come and go at will.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy announced that it would lower its flags to half
staff for 24 hours beginning Wednesday morning, when the ashes of
the three people killed by the bomb attack on the Chinese Embassy
in Belgrade are scheduled to arrive in Beijing. This is intended
``as a sign of respect,'' said Bill Palmer, an embassy spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral plans have not been announced for the three who were
killed _ Shao Yunhuan, a 48-year-old reporter from the official New
China News Agency; Xu Xinghu, 31, a reporter for the Guangming
Daily newspaper, and his wife Zhu Ying, who worked in the
advertising department of the same newspaper. Six Chinese who were
seriously injured and 20 more with light injuries will return on
the same plane Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the wave of antipathy toward things American,
theaters throughout China have been ordered to stop showing
American films, according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is evidence that Chinese leaders do not
want to jeopardize foreign trade and investment. The New China News
Agency reported on meetings Tuesday between the chairman of
Motorola Inc., a major investor in China, and the mayor and the
Communist Party chief of the city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
   The press account said the two officials reassured Motorola
chairman Gary Tooker that anger over the embassy attack ``would not
affect Tianjin's resolve and policies to open to the outside
world.'' The officials ``pledged to support an expansion of the
friendly ties with Motorola.''

 &HT;    Clinton's Atlanta visit showcases downtown market
 &HT;    By Carlos Campos
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For two hours Tuesday, President Bill Clinton acted
like head cheerleader for a pep rally in support of Atlanta's
efforts at urban renewal, while charming the vendors in the Sweet
Auburn Curb Market and praising their entrepreneurial spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The president heaped praise on the city's work to improve
inner-city neighborhoods suffering from years of blight and
neglect. He brought together a handful of local residents and
business people at the Curb Market to listen to their success
stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we try to take this example to the
whole nation,'' Clinton said of Atlanta's efforts. ``I believe we
ought not to leave anybody behind when we go into the 21st century.
I want people to see you and believe it can be done in their
neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton used the brief Atlanta trip to push his ``new markets''
initiative now before Congress, which he announced during his State
of the Union address in January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew to Atlanta with a planeload of national executives
from American Airlines, Goldman Sachs, Aetna, AT&AMP;T Wireless,
Bankers Trust, Delta Airlines, AFLAC, BellSouth and others.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraging businesses and financial institutions to invest in
depressed communities during the current economic boom is part of
the president's new initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The downtown market was selected as the backdrop for the
president's visit because it has benefitted from $4.9 million in
federal loans which have helped refurbish the once-flagging
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held an informal chat session with local business
people, including Jason Slaughter, president and CEO of
International Food Specialties, Sallie Daniel, a vice-president
with NationsBank, Ken Blakely of the Centennial Olympic Park Area,
John Aderhold of Aderhold Properties, Sonya Jones and Vivian Reid,
shop owners in the Curb Market, and Tricia Donegan, a co-owner of
Eureka, a new restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I and her husband started the business a year
and a half ago,'' Reid told the president. ``It's been growing
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sipped from a cup of Cameroon Boyo coffee he was given
at the coffee shop where Reid works as he listened to each person's
story.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, at Clinton's side throughout his
visit, said he was proud the president chose Atlanta as an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a validation of the success that we've had,
not only in the Empowerment Zone, but also in revitalizing other
parts of our city that are not in the zone itself,'' Campbell said.
``Our unemployment is the lowest it's been in years, job creation's
the highest, construction building permits are a record, people are
moving back into the city, crime rates going down. I think it's a
city that's a great success story in large part because of the
partnership with this administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Empowerment Zone was established under a 1994, $250
million Clinton administration program to seed economic growth in
disadvantaged neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell accepted a last minute invitation from Clinton to
return to Washington on Air Force One to help the president push
some anti-crime legislation pending before Congress, Campbell Press
Secretary Nick Gold said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance at the Curb Market caused an exciting buzz
at the market among the vendors, many craning their necks over a
mob of reporters to get a view of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Jones delivered on her promise to send the president back to
Washington with a sweet potato cheesecake, one of her specialties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also accepted a bite of cheesecake Jones offered while
he visited her Sweet Auburn Bread Company. ``Boy, that's great,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a produce stand, the Korean owners Joy Choi and Chung Park
said they were so excited to shake hands with the president, they
forgot to give him something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prepared a fruit basket, but we forgot that one,'' Park
said. ``Too excited.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the tour, Clinton stopped before reporters
with a bag full of kaolin _ a clay that is mined heavily in Georgia
_ he was given at one booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys know what this is?'' the president said. ``This is
kaolin. It's the stuff Kaopectate is made of.''
</P>
<P>
   The president kidded with reporters about the unique regional
offerings at the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you guys see the cow's ears and pig's feet back there?''
he said. Clinton then told a story of how Russian President Boris
Yeltsin once cut the ear off of a roasted pig and said ``If I was a
real friend of Russia, I'd eat it.''

STATE WANTS TO OFFER MCAS HELP BY NEXT YEAR, PEYSER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Board of Education chairman James A. Peyser hopes that
by next year the state panel will be able to help rescue school
districts that do poorly on the state's MCAS exam.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Tuesday at a luncheon with Globe editors and reporters,
Peyser said the board is working on a way to inspect and evaluate
schools that fail the controversial competency test, with some
consequences attached.
</P>
<P>
   He said student data would be used to track improvements and
evaluate districts that are not performing well. An ``evaluation
team'' of rating specialists would examine why the students failed,
and how much the school was at fault.
</P>
<P>
   Once the team determines the root of the problem, then the board
would decide if the school or school district requires remedial or
punitive action.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser, who was appointed to the Board of Education by Governor
Paul Cellucci in March, also said he expects the failure rate for
the current round of MCAS testing _ which resumes with the
multiple-choice segment next week _ to be about 20 percent, the
same as last year.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong discussion that touched on a wide range of
education issues, Peyser reiterated his support of testing for
veteran teachers, noted he would like to see the cap lifted on
charter schools, and said he would be closely monitoring the
success or failure of the statewide school voucher system recently
approved in Florida. Peyser favors vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Peyser said he would like to see the board approve charters that
``embody excellence'' and can prove in their charter proposals
precisely how that will be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the Littleton, Colo., school tragedy, Peyser said
educators need to pay more attention to the cultures of schools and
to work to create school identities and mission statements that are
more inclusive. He said he does not think placing metal detectors
or police officers in schools are good ideas, unless they are a
last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools should be communities and not institutions that you
pass through,'' said Peyser, executive director of the Pioneer
Institute, a conservative think tank. ``Knowing and establishing
the culture of a school seems to be one answer to the problem.''

 &HT;    Supporters, critics of president line streets of AtlantaBy Alan
Judd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ James Washington remembers when drug dealers and
prostitutes roamed his neighborhood and crowds gathered only when
the young victims of serial killer Wayne Williams were brought to
the nearby medical examiner's office.
</P>
<P>
   So Washington, 52, was especially gratified Tuesday not just by
President Clinton's visit to Sweet Auburn, but also by what it
signified _ the economic rebirth of a once-blighted part of
downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a bad area,'' Washington said, leaning on his
cane as he waited for a glimpse of the president leaving the Sweet
Auburn Curb Market at Butler Street and Edgewood Avenue. ``You
wouldn't see a police officer after 10 o'clock at night.... (But)
I'm really enjoying this. It shows some heart for him to come down
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington was among the several hundred people who waited in
the hot sun outside the market for two hours while Clinton was
inside extolling economic development in inner cities and rural
areas. Some pulled their children out of school to stand outside,
and one 17-year-old patient at Hughes Spalding Children's Hospital
who hoped to see Clinton came outside hooked to three IVs; neither
she nor her nurse would give their names.
</P>
<P>
   Most said they appreciated the president's visit. But many
complained that they were allowed to see little more than the
president's car speed past. A few people brought placards
protesting the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight, with city dump trucks and MARTA buses
forming makeshift blockades at several intersections and police
officers and Secret Service agents keeping onlookers at least half
a block from the market. Because of security concerns, the closest
Clinton came to making a public appearance was on the tarmac at
Hartsfield International Airport, where he greeted 10 AmeriCorps
and VISTA volunteers, telling them, ``You folks remind me why I
want to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   But at Sweet Auburn, Clinton didn't even step outside to wave to
the crowd, and a white canvas tent shielded his limousine from view
as he entered and left the market's back door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really horrible,'' Rogena Nealy said as she stretched
over a police barricade to peek at Clinton's motorcade from
Coca-Cola Place, almost a block away. ``But with them bombing the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade, I can understand the security for our
president. This is a very hostile time for the president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A few in the crowd shared the hostility. Jack Jersawitz, a
socialist activist who ran for mayor of Atlanta in 1997, brought a
sign that read, ``Try and hang terrorist Clinton. Victory to
Yugoslavia.'' Another protestor, Diane Mathiowetz, carried a
bullhorn and several hand-lettered posters, including one that
identified NATO as ``New American Terrorist Organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody like to hold a sign against the war in Yugoslavia?''
Mathiowetz called out to the crowd, but few responded. Marialice
Haufe, a senior from Georgia State University who later identified
herself as a Clinton supporter, spotted the NATO poster and said,
``Oh, I like that one,'' and lifted it above her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't come specifically to hold a sign,'' Haufe said. ``But
I like to follow political figures around whenever they show up. If
you're going to be out in the crowd, why not hold up a sign and
express your opinion?''
</P>
<P>
   It was unlikely, though, that Clinton saw much more of the
onlookers than they saw of him. The motorcade traveled over just a
few hundred yards of surface streets off the Downtown Connector,
and he was gone from Sweet Auburn in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   Just seeing the car, though, was enough for James Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it move,'' he said moments after Clinton left. ``It was
the highlight of my day.''

 &HT;    King lawyer asks court to consider 'Dream' speech ownership
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke to a
divided nation from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial more than 35
years ago, he wanted his oratory to reach as many people as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   His ``I Have a Dream'' speech, climaxing the March on
Washington, not only ignited a crowd of more than 200,000 people on
the Washington Mall, it was broadcast live to millions of
television viewers. But today the family of the slain civil rights
leader is waging a court battle to control the rights to King's
legacy, including the famous Aug. 28, 1963, speech.
</P>
<P>
   Before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta on
Tuesday, a lawyer for the family asked a three-judge panel to rule
that the rights to the speech belong to King's estate and should
not be used by others who want to profit from it. The suit by the
King estate against CBS News was dismissed by a district court,
which said King had forfeited his rights to the speech because it
was widely disseminated. It could be several months before the
appeals panel decides, but it not a debate that is likely to fade.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than a free-speech versus copyright argument. It is
a battle over who will profit from one of the most widely quoted
pieces of this century's oratory, said David Garrow, a King
historian and Emory University professor.
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment and copyright claims set forth in the suit
by CBS and the King estate, respectively, are ``the kind of case in
which an historian can laugh at the arguments made by both sides,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is accused in the pleadings of also profiting from the
speech by licensing the use of its archival film at rates of up to
$2,500 per minute.
</P>
<P>
   Garrow added, ``If the Kings are able to successfully beat up on
CBS, which may deserve it a little, the end result of a King
victory could be to further restrict and constrict public access to
King's work.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not the intention of the Kings or the Martin Luther King
Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, said Dexter King, the
center president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're simply following my father's conduct and trying to
respect his wishes and intent,'' he said outside the courthouse.
``My father's actions and his conduct were to protect the speech.
He filed for many copyrights for his works. This is a very
important case.'' King's widow, Coretta Scott King, sat with her
son on the front row of the courtroom during Tuesday's hourlong
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past few years, the King family has moved aggressively
to protect King's legacy. It has brought a lawsuit to prevent
companies from using King's image on refrigerator magnets. It lost
a lawsuit in 1993 seeking to remove thousands of King's personal
papers from his alma mater, Boston University, and bring them back
to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hampton, who produced ``Eyes on the Prize,'' the public
television series on the civil rights movement, was sued and later
settled with the King estate. When USA Today reprinted the ``I Have
a Dream'' speech in 1993 to mark the 30th anniversary of the March
on Washington, it too was sued and also settled with the family.
</P>
<P>
   By holding the copyrights, the family can prevent the misuse of
King's works, said Ray Patterson, a copyright law professor at the
University of Georgia. If the court rules the ``I Have a Dream''
speech is in the public domain, anyone could use the speech for any
purpose, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes _ or 62 percent _ of the speech were broadcast in
``The 20th Century with Mike Wallace,'' a documentary CBS produced
in 1994 with the cable network, Arts &AMP; Entertainment. The
documentary, in which the civil rights movement was featured in one
segment, was broadcast and sold as a boxed set by A&AMP;E.
</P>
<P>
   The King family filed suit against CBS in November 1996, saying
the network infringed upon the family's copyright. But in a ruling
last summer, U.S. District Judge William O'Kelley dismissed the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one of the most public and most widely disseminated
speeches in history, it could be the poster child for general
publications,'' O'Kelley wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Beck, a King family lawyer, told the federal appeals
court Tuesday that King registered the speech with the U.S.
Copyright Office a month after giving the speech and also
successfully sued a company in 1964 that sought to sell tapes of
the speech in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conduct shows an attitude to protect his work,'' Beck
said. Simply giving the speech to such a large audience also did
not cause the copyright to be forfeited, Beck said, adding, ``When
someone makes a speech in public, one doesn't have to stand up and
say, 'All rights reserved.' ``
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Judges Lanier Anderson III and Paul Roney
expressed concern that King had allowed an advance copy of his
speech to be handed out to the news media and that the Southern
Christian Leadership Council, of which King was president, later
reprinted the entire speech in its newsletter, without listing any
copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to believe that Dr. King didn't know what was
in that newsletter. . . when the speech itself was published in its
entirety,'' Anderson said. ``It would have only been a matter of
courtesy. . . to make sure it's all right with him, would it not?''
</P>
<P>
   Beck said he believed that King did not authorize the
publication in the newsletter. As for the advance text, the most
well-known passages of the speech were not in it because they were
in King's extemporaneous remarks, Beck added, noting that CBS
broadcast 90 percent of the ad-libbed portion in the A&AMP;E program.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter shows the King did not move to protect his
copyright of the speech, Floyd Abrams, a lawyer for CBS, told the
court.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Beck responded sharply to questions as to
whether the King family is seeking to profit from Dr. King's
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   The King family routinely provides the speech free for use by
schools, but CBS charges up to $2,500 a minute for its broadcast
rights to the speech, he said. ``Let's talk about who's being
greedy here,'' he said.Bill Rankin writes for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, Atlanta, Ga.

 &HT;    Families of ValuJet crash victims gather to dedicate site
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE EVERGLADES, Fla._They gathered near this lonely spot three
years ago, numb from shock and loss, trying to comprehend how their
loved ones could've perished aboard the doomed jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, they came back again to dedicate a memorial to the dead
from ValuJet Flight 592, quietly laying 110 roses at the base of a
solemn memorial overlooking the vast plain of sawgrass where the
jet went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's peaceful,'' said Eunice Dowd of Douglasville, Ga., whose
sister, Angie Green of Nashville, Tenn., died aboard the plane.
``At first I thought the memorial looked kind of stark and lonely,
but as you walk through it, it's nice. The peace is nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Peace has not come easily to many of the victims' families.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-bound DC-9, flying on Mother's Day, 1996, filled
with smoke shortly after taking off from Miami International
Airport. The crew fought for several minutes to bring the crippled
aircraft back around for an emergency landing in Miami, but a
furious blaze from improperly-packed oxygen cannisters in the
forward cargo hold sent the plane plunging earthward at more than
400 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The victims' families were left with troubling questions about
the discount airline's safety record, as well as the work of
government inspectors and regulators who oversaw it. ValuJet has
since disappeared, transformed into AirTran, another discount
operation with a heavy presence in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the troubling questions, the families were left with
a terrible void in their grief_no bodies to cry over, visit and
bury.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of rescue workers combed through the watery muck for
weeks, but the impact of the crash was so great they found only
scattered remains of the 110 victims. There were only scattered
belongings, too_a tennis shoe here, a scrap of clothing there.
</P>
<P>
   The crash site is about 20 miles west of the Miami airport,
about eight miles north of U.S. 41, a two-lane asphalt strip that
splits the Everglades on its way west to Naples.
</P>
<P>
   Days after the crash, some of the stricken families were taken
in buses down a bumpy levee to within a few hundred yards of the
actual crash site, which is accessible only by boat.
</P>
<P>
   For many, that was as close as they came to having a physical
place to fix in their minds for memories of their lost loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally have a place to come to,'' said Amanda Myers of
Albany, N.Y., whose parents, Conway and Anna Laurie Hamilton of
Miami, died on the plane as they flew to their granddaughter's
graduation from Atlanta's Emory University. ``This is where they
are.''
</P>
<P>
   The memorial sits atop a levee overlooking the distant crash
site. It consists of 110 cement columns topped by four-sided
pyramids, arranged in a triangle facing north toward the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me the design is an allegory for the rise of the victims'
souls and the fall of the fateful plane,'' said Lee Sawyer, Myers'
sister.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural students from the University of Miami designed the
memorial, working with the families. Most of the materials and
labor were donated, with students helped by master craftsmen from
local unions. They spent most weekends for the past several months
completing their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means no one will ever forget,'' said Jane Lathem of
Alpharetta, Ga., whose son, Ray, died aboard the plane with other
members of Mount Pisgah United Methodist Church as they returned
from a mission trip to Latin America. ``This will always be here to
remind people of what happened to our loved ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The family members have formed a group to lobby for safer
airlines, sometimes joining with relatives of victims from other
crashes. Many still have civil lawsuits pending, and many hope the
federal government will conduct a criminal investigation of the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an on-going issue with the families,'' said Richard
Kessler, an Atlanta lawyer who lost his wife, Kathleen. ``There is
legislation in Congress now called a `passenger's bill of rights,'
but nowhere in that is there a statement saying the first priority
is to get the passengers safely to their destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with those frustrations, the families struggle to cope
with their losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the same anger and sorrow you felt the first day,''
said Patrice Bowman of Miami, who lost her fiance, Robert Woodus
Jr., in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months after the crash, Bowman gave birth to Woodus' son,
Robert III. On Tuesday, she fought back tears as the toddler
carried a peach-colored rose to the memorial in honor of the father
he never knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so hard,'' she said. ``But I look at it that I lost
something, but I was also left with a special gift, our son.''

 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Six days before the Israeli elections, Chaim
Yisrael, an elderly Hasidic Jew, hurried to complete his shopping
near the ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim. He was on his
way to tutor Torah, he said, but he could spare a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, there's only one real leader for us,'' he said,
raising his bearded chin, peering heavenward over the brim of his
black hat, and pointing at the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Yisrael said, he is planning to go to the polls,
and to cast a half-hearted vote for Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the personal side, he looks a little like Clinton
morally,'' Yisrael said. ``But ideologically, he's fine. What
choice do we have really? Politics is the land of relativity, and
he will be better to protect the land of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight miles away and a world apart, Moussa Ibrahim was equally
equivocal. Standing over a mountain of salty pumpkin seeds in his
gourmet shop in Abu Ghosh, an Israeli-Arab village, he expressed
deep cynicism about the possibility for change. But he said he will
vote for Ehud Barak, the Labor Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not because I am a big fan,'' he said. ``But because I want to
be able to go out in the street and say I have a prime minister who
is not a paranoid, a cheater, and a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   In an election campaign that is reputedly a personality
competition, devoid of real debate on the issues, few Israelis seem
inspired by the candidates themselves. Many say they will
effectively cast their ballot while holding their nose.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis tend to be skeptical of predictions. They do not trust
the polls, which show Barak ahead of Netanyahu by about eight
percentage points in a five-way race. A tour of the southern half
of Israel, including conversations with scores of voters, instead
leaves the impression that Netanyahu and Barak are in a dead heat
in a race that will go down to the wire.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the country does not seem gripped by the intensity of a
tight election battle. Balconies are only spottily strung with
political banners, there have been no big political rallies, partly
for security reasons, and no political debates between Netanyahu,
whose nickname is Bibi, and Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis feel that this is a critical election in which
they will select the leader who oversees sensitive negotiations
over a Palestinian state, an Israeli military withdrawal from
southern Lebanon, and the fate of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   But they are weary of the high-decibel level of Israeli
politics, disgusted by dirty deals and profoundly skeptical of the
maturation of the process in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Navon and Shoshana Armand, lifelong members of Netanyahu's Likud
Party, do not even know if they will bother to vote on May 17,
which is a holiday, a day off work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' said Armand, a bus driver in Beersheba. ``If we're
not on a picnic.''
</P>
<P>
   In Efrat, a Jewish settlement of 6,450 people in the West Bank,
the grass is green and the stores modern and well-stocked.
</P>
<P>
   In the small shopping plaza, the town bakery, is decorated,
inside and out, with Netanyahu's face. In 1996, Efrat voted
overwhelmingly for the prime minister, and most residents still
back him.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Netter, 22, a clerk at the post office, said it did not
require much thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the only one who supports us,'' said Netter, an
immigrant from France.
</P>
<P>
   Eti Avrahami, however, is sharply critical of the prime
minister, speaking more like a small business owner than a settler.
Her family owns a grocery store in the center of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to believe in Bibi,'' she said. ``But everything
seemed to come to a halt under him. The economy is down. The
society is stuck. There's no forward motion, no swoosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Avrahami echoed the themes of Barak's campaign against
Netanyahu. People like her, defectors from the committed core of
Netanyahu supporters, are very worrisome to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If Efrat is suburban, Bet Haggai near Hebron is a hard-core
settlement, a Zionist outpost among the Palestinian towns. The many
shuttered houses on its edges suggest that the living is hard.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Bet Haggai, however, where 98.8 percent of voters
selected Netanyahu last time, the prime minister does not have the
electorate sewn up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want to punish Netanyahu because he did not
stop Oslo,'' the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement signed in
1993, said Lederer, the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Yisrael Buskila, 24, is only a renter, a newlywed who moved in
because the price was right and the view was splendid. But he
believes from his core that Israel should hold onto as much of the
West Bank as possible. If Benny Begin, the right-wing candidate for
prime minister, had a chance, he would get Buskila's vote, he said.
But he doesn't, so Buskila said he will vote for Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   If anywhere is unadulterated Netanyahu territory, it is the
somewhat desolate southern town of Netivot, home to poor and
working class Sephardic Jews, and a tourist destination.. The town
has the tomb of Baba Sali, the late Rabbi Yisrael Abuhatzeira, a
Moroccan-born sage who was revered as a healer and miracle worker.
</P>
<P>
   Yhye Dahan, 63, sells Baba Sali portraits, holy oil and amulets
in the gift shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 42 years here in the grave,'' he said. ``I worked here
even before the rabbi was dead. I know they pray here for
everything, including candidates. And all the religious Sephardi
follow Bibi.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, a raucous bar mitzvah was being celebrated with cous
cous and grilled meat. One man banged a drum, while another
strummed an oud. Shouting above the revelry, Felix Smadar, a port
worker, said, ``We're Bibi. Why? Because he's a strong man, and all
the Arabs are afraid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ashkelon, a port town that is home to new immigrants from the
former Soviet Union and older immigrants from North Africa, Ilana
Tveritzim, a clerk who left Russia nine years ago, is one of the
immigrants whom the candidates are courting furiously. Mrs.
Tveritzim is abandoning Netanyahu. ``He tends to bump his head
against other heads,'' she said. ``That is not good in a leader.
Maybe Barak is more mature.'
</P>
<P>
   In Ramat Aviv Gimmel, the affluent yuppie center of Tel Aviv,
voters in 1996 came out strongly for Shimon Peres, the Labor Party
leader who lost to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the places where Israelis say they will sink into
a deep depression _ or go abroad for a while _ if Netanyahu is
re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Sari Yisrael, who is a real estate broker, said she and her
friends are panicked at the possibility of a Netanyahu victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it will be Bibi, it will be tragedy _ disaster,'' she said.
``If he wins, I think I'm going to lock myself in the house for a
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Election campaigns underscore the quandary of Israeli Arabs,
citizens who feel they are treated as second class. With more than
300,000 voters, they represent an important bloc. In the past,
their turnout, which is relatively low by Israeli standards, has
been somewhat assured by their desire to cast a ballot for the Arab
parties in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But in this election, where there is likely to be a runoff, will
they be motivated to vote a second time, to choose between Barak
and Netanyahu? In a close race, the answer is very important to
Barak, and his party is working hard to overcome the cynicism many
Israeli Arabs feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leftist parties scream, ``Give us your vote so that we can
get back in power and make things right for you,' `' said Ibrahim,
standing in his immaculate shop in the relatively prosperous Arab
village of Abu Ghosh. ``Then regimes change, but nothing changes
for us. They are right to worry about the Israeli-Arab turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a community-wide campaign is urging strictly
religious Jews in Mea Shearim to be neutral in the prime minister's
race. It is a pragmatic response to the possibility that Barak
could win as well as an expression of the feeling that the
religious community has become too politicized.
</P>
<P>
   Most members of the religious community vote according to their
rabbis' recommendation, although most rabbis have not yet made
their endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for whom she would cast her ballot, Asya Konofnitsky, a
young mother, looked stunned by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I know?'' she said. ``The Torah sages have been
silent. What they tell me. That's what I will vote.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long-term interest rates, which have been rising
steadily since early April, jumped to their highest level in almost
a year Tuesday as investors continued to worry about inflation and
the next meeting of Federal Reserve policy-makers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the U.S. economy to slow down significantly and a
reminder last week from Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that
inflation could become a problem again, have spooked investors, at
least for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of fear and nervousness in the market at this
juncture,'' said Thomas Connor, head government trader at J.P.
Morgan Securities. This is not because investors expect a surge in
inflation this year or even that the Fed will raise interest rates
next week. Instead, they are nervous because they have to wait for
new inflation data and the Fed meeting before they can determine
whether the recent rise in long-term interest rates has been
overdone, in part because of Greenspan's warning, or will push on
toward 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in the yield on the 30-year bond, which increased to
5.83 percent, also cooled the stock market a little, leaving the
Dow Jones industrial average up only 18.90 points, at 11,026.15.
</P>
<P>
   Also adding to the gloomy atmosphere was a lackluster auction of
five-year Treasury notes and negative comments about the bond
market from Stanley Druckenmiller, the manager of George Soros'
Quantum Fund. According to Bridge News, Druckenmiller told
investors at a conference in London that bonds were in a bear
market now and that the Fed would raise interest rates by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainty factor, traders and analysts said
that until the results of the Fed meeting were known, long-term
rates could edge higher. And the bond market could get a worse
shock if two inflation reports _ the Producer Price Index on
Thursday and the Consumer Price Index on Friday _ are
disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports are expected to reflect the recent rise in crude
oil prices, which saw the price of a barrel reach $18.98 last week.
The unknown is whether these two inflation barometers have positive
surprises _ as they did in March _ or negative ones. In March, the
consumer index rose only two-tenths of a percent despite a 1.6
percent jump in energy costs. For this month, Wall Street is
forecasting a five-tenths of a percent rise in the producer index
and a four-tenths of a percent rise in the consumer index.
</P>
<P>
   The government report on retail sales for April, which is due
Thursday, will also signal how fast the American consumer is still
spending. Consumers are the main reason that the economy has grown
at a brisk 5.25 percent pace over the last six months, far too fast
for Fed policy-makers to remain comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities, said he
was forecasting an increase of three-tenths of a percent in retail
sales for April. But he said investors would also keep their eyes
on the revision for the March data. An upward revision of that
number would add to fears that consumer spending will keep the
economy chugging along too quickly and eventually force the Fed to
raise interest rates, maybe by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed is not expected to raise interest rates to slow
economic growth when the Federal Open Market Committee meets next
Tuesday, some analysts are wondering whether the Fed will send a
warning shot to the bond market. The central bank would do this by
indicating, with a formal directive, that it thought its next
interest rate move would most likely be an increase.
</P>
<P>
   But if the inflation news is not alarming and the Fed stands
pat, then there is a chance for interest rates to fall a little
until the next round of economic data provide a clearer picture of
how strong the economy is and how persistent price pressures might
become.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year bond fell 19/31, to 91 26/32, while the
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.83 percent
from 5.79 percent on Monday. That was the highest yield since 5.84
percent on May 27, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The new five-year Treasury notes yielded 5.367 percent and the
demand was weak, traders said. There is a 10-year note auction on
Wednesday. In when-issued trading on Tuesday, the yield on the
10-year note was 5.49 percent, up from 5.46 percent on Monday. The
yield on the current 10-year note rose to 5.57 percent, from 5.52
percent on Monday.

 &HT;    Mummies may begin trip to Carlos Museum by week's end
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario _ The Carlos Museum's mummies are getting
ready to hit the road for their trip south.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a team of five curators and conservators _ and two
packers _ from the Emory University museum arrived at the Niagara
Falls Museum to begin preparations to move the $2 million cache of
ancient Egyptian artifacts to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing purple plastic gloves, the Carlos contingent began
inspecting the museum's 83-piece purchase and shoring up the
fragile objects, which look like they have been gathering dust
since they were installed in this building in 1958. Using little
brushes and special fixatives, the conservators fastened fragments
that might fall off during the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really exciting to get our hands on them,'' said Peter
Lacovara, curator of Egyptian Art at the Carlos. ``When I began at
the museum one year ago I hoped they would improve the collection,
but I didn't think they'd do it this quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The mummies and decorated mummy cases lie in vitrines like
Sleeping Beauties _ or Uglies, depending on how you feel about
mummified humans, some of which are 3,000 years old. Sprinkled
throughout the cases are scarabs, canopic jars (containers for the
dead person's organs), even ancient baskets, along with
reproductions of Egyptian sculpture and such oddments as a
medieval-looking pot with a cactus growing in it.
</P>
<P>
   In general, this Niagara Falls institution is a curious place,
often looking more like a collectibles booth than a museum. The
first floor houses the Daredevil Hall of Fame, a collection of
falls memorabilia. The mummies share the second floor with dinosaur
and whale bones, a display of origami and the plaster busts of
Queen Victoria and Napoleon III, to name a few objects that crowd
the room.
</P>
<P>
   William Jamieson, the Toronto collector who purchased the
artifacts from the Niagara Falls Museum and sold them to the
Carlos, also has been on the scene. A collector himself _ though he
specializes in tribals arts and shrunken heads _ Jamieson, 44, is
excited that the mummy collection is coming to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really liked the Carlos' plan to keep them together and
restore them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Carlos acquisitions are expected to leave Niagara Falls at
the end of the week, transported _ for free _ by North American Van
Lines. The details of their arrival in Atlanta are being kept
secret for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Examples from the collection, purchased in February after an
extraordinary public plea for funds, will go on view in July. The
entire conservation process, a major undertaking, will take two
years. Said Lacovara, ``Some of these coffins look like they went
over the falls.''

MORALES AIDE SAYS LAWYER IN TOBACCO-FEE CASE ADMITTED NOT HAVING
CONTRACT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A former key assistant to Dan Morales has told
investigators that Marc Murr, the mystery Houston lawyer in the
tobacco lawsuit, admitted only a few weeks before the case was
settled that Murr didn't have a contract to represent the state
against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   Murr, assisted by Morales, the former Texas attorney general and
a longtime friend, attempted to claim as much as a half billion
dollars in legal fees after Morales negotiated a $17.3 billion
settlement with tobacco companies last year.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are now being investigated by the FBI and Texas
Attorney General John Cornyn, who succeeded Morales on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn turned over additional information on Morales' purported
contracts with Murr to federal investigators Friday in a meeting in
Austin, the attorney general's office reported.
</P>
<P>
   In a document filed in federal court a week ago, Cornyn accused
Morales and Murr of falsifying signatures and backdating two
contracts, dated Oct. 17, 1996, and Jan. 31, 1997. Cornyn called
the contracts ``fake'' and said they were part of an effort to
mislead a federal judge deciding on fees in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the purported 1996 contract wasn't created until
1998. Another source familiar with the investigation said the
second contract may have been created as long as a year after it
was dated.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Cornyn made his allegations, Murr abruptly
withdrew a claim against the state for about $260 million in legal
fees, which had been awarded by a state arbitration panel appointed
by himself and Morales. Murr still is to receive $1 million in fees
payable by the tobacco industry under a separate, national
arbitration award entered late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter, Morales' top state lawyer on the tobacco suit, has
reported that Murr told him in December 1997, the month before the
case was settled, that Murr didn't have a state contract, a source
close to Cornyn's investigation said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Potter, who now teaches at the University of Texas Law School,
declined comment Tuesday about any discussions with Murr. But the
source said Potter told Cornyn's office that Murr made the
admission to him in a brief conversation the two had Dec. 18, 1997,
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Potter and Murr were in Chicago for a negotiating session as
Morales and other state lawyers worked on hammering out the
settlement agreement with tobacco industry representatives that was
announced in January 1998. The agreement ended a state suit, filed
in 1996, over smoking-related health care costs and cigarette
marketing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Potter has been interviewed by the FBI and by Cornyn's office,
but he has declined to discuss details of his meetings with
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Potter said Tuesday that even before he took office Cornyn
requested a meeting to be brought up to date on tobacco issues.
Cornyn met with Potter and another Morales staffer, who now works
for Cornyn, during which ``a lot of our reservations'' about Murr
were discussed, Potter said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn aides, who didn't want to be identified, said a third
former Morales assistant, who also now works for Cornyn, contacted
federal investigators about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Morales and Murr have known each other since they worked
together at Bracewell &AMP; Patterson in Houston in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has insisted that Murr played a crucial role in the
landmark tobacco case, often as a behind-the-scenes adviser. But
other lawyers have said that Murr did little work on the case. His
name didn't publicly surface until about the time the suit was
settled.
</P>
<P>
   Murr didn't return a phone call Tuesday from the Houston
Chronicle. And his lawyer, Roy Minton of Austin, declined comment
beyond saying Murr hadn't been contacted by the FBI or the U.S.
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Morales nor his attorney, Sam Millsap of San Antonio,
returned phone calls Tuesday. Last week, Millsap said Morales
hadn't been contacted by federal investigators, and both he and
Morales heatedly denied Cornyn's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Millsap said then that Cornyn, a Republican, was trying to
discredit Morales, a Democrat who didn't seek re-election last
year, so he will not run for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The purported Oct. 17, 1996, contract between Murr and Morales
provided the Houston lawyer a 3 percent contingency. The Jan. 31,
1997, agreement, which purportedly replaced it, promised him a
``reasonable fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a state arbitration panel of three retired judges picked
by Murr and Morales last fall, Morales supported Murr's claim for 3
percent, or about $520 million. The state arbitrators awarded Murr
$260 million, which Murr moved to vacate in a brief hearing before
U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana last week.
</P>
<P>
   Folsom gave Murr 60 days to resubmit a claim before it is
formally dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Morales had a separate contract with five other private lawyers
who are sharing $3.3 billion in fees awarded by a national
arbitration panel. Tobacco companies have agreed to pay those fees.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development Tuesday, The Dallas Morning News
reported that two forensic experts hired by the newspaper had
determined that the purported Jan. 31, 1997, contract between Murr
and Morales had been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   The examiners told the newspaper that the signature pages of the
document are duplicates of a separate contract dated the same day.
The experts said the initial three-page contract was altered and
then photocopied as part of the second document.
</P>
<P>
   They said some signatures from a previously unknown agreement
that Morales had with Murr and Dallas attorney Will Pryor were
transferred to the new document, as Cornyn alleged last week.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor, a former top assistant to Morales, told the Houston
Chronicle that he and Murr signed a contract on Jan. 31, 1997, to
assist Morales in the tobacco suit. Pryor, who by then was a
mediator in private practice, said he quit the case several weeks
later because he felt uncomfortable with the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said he was worried that questions might be raised because
of his former close association with Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Minton, Murr's lawyer, has acknowledged that the Murr-only
contract dated Jan. 31, 1997, was ``put together sometime after
Jan. 31,'' but he said he didn't know when.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn has said he also will turn over his findings to the
Travis County District Attorney's office which prosecutes public
corruption cases involving state officials.

SENATE DEBATES YOUTH VIOLENCE LEGISLATION IN WAKE OF COLORADO
SHOOTINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since the Colorado high school
shootings, the Senate began debate Tuesday on youth violence
legislation that could lead to new gun control provisions as well
as tougher law enforcement measures aimed at young people.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which had languished in the Senate for months,
was given sudden prominence as lawmakers rushed to register their
concern about the April 20 shooting at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The basic legislation would give federal officials greater
ability to prosecute juveniles as young as 14 as adults for serious
felonies and drug crimes. It would pump more than a $1 billion
annually into juvenile crime programs over five years and address
the problem of youth gangs.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers also made it clear that they hoped to use the
measure as a vehicle to address broader concerns, ranging from too
much media violence to too many guns, that may have led to the
tragedy in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day the senators paraded before the media to
announce a series of amendments, including making it harder to
purchase firearms at gun shows to barring film makers from using
public lands to make violent movies.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Republicans stressed the need to beef up
enforcement of gun laws and address cultural deficiencies that they
said lead to violence. Democrats talked more about funding after
school programs and cracking down on guns.
</P>
<P>
   And both sides acknowledged that the debate over guns was likely
to be the most vigorous and could overshadow other elements of the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that ultimately it is going to devolve into a gun
fight,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chief sponsor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some Democrats made it clear that they were going to
attempt to force votes on a number of gun measures, including
background checks at gun shows and a three-day waiting period to
buy a handgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without guns, families in Littleton, Colo., would not be
grieving, 15 people would be alive today,'' said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   However, Republicans argued that the problem is that current gun
control measures are not being enforced and proposed instead that
more money be spent on prosecution of violators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing a law sounds good, but to maximize our impact we've
got to prosecute the laws we've got,'' said Sen. Jeff Sessions,
R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the expected showdown, lawmakers of both parties
appeared to agree on two gun control provisions. One would bar
juveniles who committed felonies from purchasing guns even as
adults. The other would bar youths under 18 from purchasing
semiautomatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional debate comes a day after President Clinton
hosted a conference on youth violence that focussed on a range of
issues involving entertainment images and access to weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called on Congress to approve a package of gun
control measures, including raising the age of purchase of handguns
from 18 to 21 and holding adults responsible for youths who gain
access to guns that are used to kill people. The president has
called for a limit of one handgun purchase a month.
</P>
<P>
   But wary of the power of the National Rifle Association, which
opposes all of these measures, many lawmakers of both parties have
been reluctant to get too far out front on the gun issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said that while she
supported instant background checks at gun shows, she was
noncommittal about the other proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said she was worried about the federal government
stepping on state laws regarding guns. Furthermore, the Texas
Republican said she does not believe her constituents were
demanding more gun control, even in the wake of the Colorado
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Texas we are a gun-owning state. We are a hunting state. It
is pretty strong for second amendment rights,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers acknowledged that there were no simple solutions
to the youth violence and they worried about solutions that could
step on people's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., said he was worried that
``we don't erode the first amendment rights or second amendment
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in trying to regulate such rights was apparent
when a group of GOP senators unveiled proposals that included
barring the use of federal property for the filming of excessively
violent movies.
</P>
<P>
   The senators were asked if such a law would prevent the filming
on public lands of historic events such as Custer's last stand, the
1876 Battle of Little Bighorn, where Gen. George Custer and his
unit of 210 soldiers were massacred by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   None of the lawmakers could answer the question.

 &HT;    Georgia GOP cools to reception of top NRA speaker
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Colorado school shootings fresh in their minds,
some Republicans are objecting to plans to have a top National
Rifle Association official address the Georgia GOP convention later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   These Republicans fear a public relations nightmare if the
Georgia party welcomes Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive
vice-president, to its Augusta, Ga. convention on May 22 at a time
when polls suggest Americans increasingly support gun control
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month's killings at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., the NRA has come under withering criticism for
its advocacy of measures that make it easier to own and carry guns.
And NRA president Charlton Heston and LaPierre signed a letter
following the massacre opposing new controls on guns.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans have had a good relationship with the NRA,
some are now saying the organization should lower its profile for a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's bad timing, to say the least,'' state Rep. Mark
Burkhalter (R-Alpharetta, Ga.) said of LaPierre's scheduled speech.
``The prudent thing to do would probably be to uninvite him.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) said Bob Barr, an NRA director, is
the only one of his Georgia colleagues in the House who ``doesn't
see a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, in fact, said he ``heartily'' supports LaPierre's
appearance at the convention. ``These issues weigh heavily on the
minds of Georgia Republicans,'' he said. ``We need to address what
we can do about youth violence today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Paul, the Georgia GOP chairman, said Tuesday that he finds
himself in a political jam because of the invitation he issued in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an invitation that was extended before all this stuff
happened,'' Paul said. ``I told everybody I am not going to
withdraw the invitation.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul, whose successor will be chosen at the convention, said
that asking LaPierre to withdraw would amount to blaming the NRA
for the killings in Colorado, although he said he understands why
the invitation has become a sensitive topic.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre did not return telephone calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   State Republicans find themselves in a dilemma. In spite of the
new energy for some gun control measures, revoking the invitation
would no doubt anger some NRA members and gun rights advocates in
Georgia. They are an important constituency in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Democratic Gov. Roy Barnes and Attorney General Thurbert
Baker were glad to have the NRA's endorsement in the last election.
</P>
<P>
   And Barnes signed into law a measure that prohibits Georgia
municipalities from suing gun manufacturers for damages related to
gun deaths. The NRA backed that legislation and Barr has introduced
a similar bill in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Paul noted that LaPierre sought the invitation, in part, to try
to ease relations with the Georgia GOP that were strained by the
Democratic endorsements.

COMAQ SERVICES CHIEF TO STEP DOWN   IN JUNE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Texas)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The chief of Compaq Computer Corp.'s big services
business will step down July 1, continuing the management exodus
from the No. 1 personal computer maker and kicking off a search for
a new executive to head the operations bought from Digital
Equipment Corp last year.
</P>
<P>
   John Rando, the former Digital executive who now is senior vice
president and general manager of Compaq Services in Stow, will
leave ``to pursue personal interests,'' a Compaq spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rando becomes the fourth senior executive to exit the
Houston-based computer maker in recent weeks as it tries to map out
a strategy to regain the profitability it enjoyed for much of the
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Compaq ousted chief executive officer Eckhard
Pfeiffer. Compaq's chief financial officer also left, as did its
worldwide sales chief.
</P>
<P>
   Rando wasn't asked to resign, Compaq said, and wasn't available
Tuesday to elaborate on his reasons for leaving or his future
plans.
</P>
<P>
   But his departure adds to the uncertainty surrounding Compaq's
prospects, said Eric Rocco, principal analyst at Dataquest in
Lowell. Services remains key to Compaq's strategy to diversifying
beyond the personal computer business, he said. ``Anytime a
hands-on person like Rando steps down there's going to be some
issues,'' Rocco said. ``This only adds to their challenge going
forward, how they move from being just a (PC) box-pushing
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Rando came to Compaq last year along with 22,000 other Digital
service employees as part of a strategy by Pfeiffer to move away
from the fiercely competitive personal computer business.
</P>
<P>
   The units now known as Compaq Services employ 27,000 worldwide,
including the majority of Compaq's 11,000 employees in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Seven thousand of the 11,000 are
in the Bay State. Of Compaq's total 1998 revenue of $31.2 billion,
the services business contributed $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, new service businesses like networking analysis have
begun to offset declines in traditional service revenue from
maintaining large corporate computer networks, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   But those results weren't enough to offset broader problems at
Compaq, and analysts questioned whether the company had done enough
to capitalize on the former Digital assets.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent executive departures from Compaq, observers now
wonder how many more changes are in store. ``You've got a situation
where everything is fair game right now,'' said S.G. Cowen analyst
Richard Chu.
</P>
<P>
   Rando, 47, graduated from Boston College with a computer science
degree in 1974 and joined Digital two years later as a software
specialist. He rose through the ranks at Digital and was a central
figure in striking a partnership with Microsoft Corp. in 1995 under
which Digital trained thousands of engineers to support the
software giant's networking products.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq said it will begin a search for Rando's successor
immediately. In a statement, Compaq chairman Ben Rosen praised
Rando for building ``one of the most motivated and successful
service organizations in the computing world'' and called the
services group ``a vital element of Compaq's future success.''
</P>
<P>
   Until July 1, Rando will continue to oversee three divisions
reporting to him. They include a customer services group, headed by
Peter Mercury; the networking and systems integration division run
by Kannankote Srikanth and a group known as operations management
services, headed by Tim Leisman.

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Democratic fund-raiser who has pleaded guilty to
campaign-related bank and tax fraud told a House panel Tuesday that
he met in 1996 with a high-ranking Chinese intelligence official
who promised him $300,000 for use in the presidential election
saying, ``We really like your president.''
</P>
<P>
   Recounting mysterious meetings at restaurants, hotel lounges and
karaoke bars, the fund-raiser, Johnny Chung, provided his first
public account of his experiences, from 1994 to 1996, as he
traveled the Far East prospecting for business clients eager for
access to the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony to the government Reform and Oversight
Committee, Chung said he met several times with the chief of
China's military intelligence agency, Gen. Ji Shengde, who directed
that the $300,000 be wired to Chung's bank account in Hong Kong for
use as contributions to President Clinton's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Chung's appearance before the House committee came at a time of
serious tension between the United States and China, when the
relationship has been badly strained by the mistaken NATO bombing
of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and an uproar in Congress over
the the possible Chinese theft of secret American nuclear data.
</P>
<P>
   Chung said that at their first meeting in August 1996, Ji used
the alias ``Xu'' and emerged as a shadowy figure from a kitchen
entrance of an abalone restaurant in Hong Kong. They spoke
obliquely about Clinton, Chung said. Ji told him, ``We hope to see
him re-elected. I will give you 300,000 U.S. dollars. You can give
it to the president and the Democratic Party,'' Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   Chung was introduced to Ji by Liu Chaoying, the daughter of
powerful Chinese general and an official in a Chinese aerospace
company. Chung said he never told Democratic Party officials that
he raised money in China, but believed that Democratic officials
were aware of his business activities there. Chung said he later
introduced Ms. Liu to Donald Fowler, who was then chairman of the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Chung said he felt uncomfortable about funneling the general's
money into the presidential campaign, and so he spent most of it
for personal and business expenses. Investigators have traced only
about $35,000 of the money to the campaign. Federal law does not
permit foreign nationals to contribute directly to American
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   After the fund-raising scandal erupted, Chung, who visited the
White House 50 times, came to personify the fund-raising abuses
committed during the president's re-election campaign. He was
responsible for nearly $400,000 in contributions to the Democratic
Party, all of which was returned after the election as tainted.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, in sometimes halting English, the California
businessman seemed less sinister than out of his depth in the
high-stakes world of presidential fund raising. In five hours of
testimony, he described himself as a ``first-generation immigrant''
who would never ``undermine the interests of my country'' and is
``as loyal to our country as any of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung pleaded guilty in March 1998 in a deal with the government
in which he agreed to cooperate fully with authorities. He was
sentenced to a suspended jail term and 3,000 hours of community
service. His testimony Tuesday under subpoena was approved by the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had never testified before, the broad outline of
Chung's account had been previously known from news reports. In his
testimony, he accepted responsibility for his misdeeds, but said
that the lawmakers who had summoned him to testify at the hearing
that they also were accountable for setting up the fund-raising
rules that he operated under. ``I didn't create the system,'' he
said. ``You did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, more than two years after this controversy erupted you,
the Congress, have done nothing to change this system,'' Chung
said. ``Indeed within the last month I received an invitation to a
fund raiser where I might have yet another photo opportunity with
some politician _ although most of you would probably run away from
me at his point.''
</P>
<P>
   Chung's appearance at the hearing showed how his fortunes had
changed since he escorted select guests on private tours of Hillary
Rodham Clinton's office. Republicans on the committee warmly
greeted him as a fund raiser whose secret dealings with Chinese
espionage officials have powerfully buttressed Republican
accusations that China put into effect a plan to use money
influence the 1996 Presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Democrats from Chung's party who turned on Chung,
bitterly denouncing him as an untrustworthy witness. ``You've had
your 15 minutes, Chung,'' said Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif. ``You are
a very minor, insignificant puppet of the Communist regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., accused Chung of providing
authorities with misleading accounts of his dealings with Hazel
O'Leary, the former energy secretary and Margaret Williams, a
former White House aide, who were investigated before they were
cleared of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Chung said that after investigators focused on him, he was
offered money to keep him from cooperating with federal authorities
and was introduced to a Los Angeles lawyer, David E. Brockway, who
Chung said would help him if he kept his silence. But after the
hearing, the lawyer denied Chung's account. ``He's a huckster and a
hustler, Brockway said in a telephone interview. ``It's a lie.''

LYCOS-USA NETWORKS DEAL DEAD, SOURCE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The controversial merger between Lycos Inc. and operations of
USA Networks Inc. is expected to be declared dead Wednesday,
according to a source close to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos, the third most popular portal on the Internet, and New
York media concern USA Networks announced in February that the
Waltham, Mass. company would be combined with a number of retail,
broadcast, and Net businesses run by USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   But the two firms have had trouble selling their vision for a
hybrid Internet/electronic retailing company to Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos shareholders were outraged by the low value the deal
placed on their shares. Lycos investors were to get no more than 35
percent of the new company's stock, while USA Networks shareholders
were to receive as much as 61.5 percent. Furious shareholders sent
the value of Lycos stock plummeting.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been teetering on the brink of collapse since
March, when David Wetherell, a member of the Lycos board who had
approved the deal, changed his mind and vowed to fight it. As chief
executive of Internet venture firm CMGI Inc., Wetherell controls
about 20 percent of Lycos stock.
</P>
<P>
   Given Wetherell's opposition and the skeptical reception among
other Lycos investors, the deal's prospects have been fading in
recent weeks. Tuesday, the merger still had a pulse, but just
barely.
</P>
<P>
   The source said Lycos and USA Networks, which is run by Barry
Diller, were engaged in last-minute negotiations to try to save the
proposed merger. But that would have required USA Networks to offer
a new, higher bid. The source described this outcome as very
unlikely and predicted a decision to abandon the deal would be made
in the wee hours of this morning.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the ambitious deal would be a blow to Lycos chief
executive Bob Davis, but he may not walk away empty-handed.
According to terms of the agreement between Lycos and USA Networks,
the deal can only be scrapped by mutual agreement. The source said
Lycos was seeking to pull the plug on the merger on the most
beneficial terms possible.
</P>
<P>
   Even an unattached Lycos is still a formidable Internet force.
The company's Web sites are used by more than half of all
Internet-using Americans, and market analysts expect it to break
even in the current quarter and turn a profit in fiscal year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry Parr, electronic commerce analyst for International
Data Corp. in Mountain View, Calif., insisted Lycos needs an
alliance with a major TV company to attract millions of people who
will be coming onto the Internet in future years.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had hoped to use USA Networks's cable channels, like USA
Network and the SciFi Channel, to promote Lycos. But Parr thinks
Lycos shareholders rejected the deal partly because they doubted
these channels had the audience size and prestige to benefit Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think really what the market was saying is if you don't have
the partner that builds your brand, you don't have the right
partner,'' said Parr.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks didn't return a call late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos shares closed Tuesday at 98 1/4, down 7, while USA
Networks shares rose 5/8 to 35 7/8.

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta poised to profit from digital TV
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For Scientific-Atlanta, AT&AMP;T's $62 billion deal to buy
MediaOne is a big stamp of approval for its investment in digital
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see AT&AMP;T's purchase of MediaOne as an emphatic validation
of the benefits of an interactive broadband network,'' says Steve
Necessary, vice president of marketing at Scientific-Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Scientific-Atlanta's enthusiasm is that AT&AMP;T has
said it intends to use MediaOne's digital networks to offer lots of
other services than television. Among them: local telephone service
and high-speed access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's strategy dovetails with that of Scientific-Atlanta, which
has launched a new equipment line that enables cable operators to
provide two-way digital television.
</P>
<P>
   The line is called Explorer 2000, and so far 90 cable systems
have signed up for it. Thirty-one have actually begun using
Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Explorer is dependent on the ability of cable operators
to rebuild their systems to handle digital traffic. That effort,
while picking up steam lately, has been slow and scattered. Only
about a quarter of all cable systems nationwide can handle digital
signals.
</P>
<P>
   But even those systems using Explorer are not taking full
advantage of the product. Most operators are using Explorer just to
provide the expanded channel capacity and sharper images of digital
technology.
</P>
<P>
   But Explorer is capable of doing so much more. It can, for
example, let viewers use their televisions to browse the Web, send
and receive e-mail, order movies on demand and shop online.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more useful the Explorer can be, the wider its appeal and
more cable operators will want to use it,'' said George Hunt, a
media analyst at Wachovia Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If consumers like the things Explorer can do, then the cable
operators will sell more of them and we'll make more money,'' says
Necessary. ``It's a win-win-win deal for us, consumers and cable
operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing campaign
</P>
<P>
   To promote the adoption of two-way television,
Scientific-Atlanta has organized a marketing effort called
``CreativEdge.''
</P>
<P>
   CreativEdge is a branding umbrella under which
Scientific-Atlanta is gathering as many different kinds of software
that make use of Explorer's two-way capacity. This software enables
Explorer to do things such as send e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Giving Scientific-Atlanta's longtime standing with cable
operators, the company is hoping its sponsorship will make
operators more likely to try new two-way software.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're nurturing applications big and small,'' says Necessary.
``And we're ensuring that these applications work fine, on any
cable system.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the applications are still in development, but most are
within months of commercial rollout. Last week, Scientific-Atlanta
sponsored a demonstration of many of these new two-way applications
for cable TV operators. It was the first time outside a national
trade show that the company had done a group presentation of
two-way software for operators.
</P>
<P>
   PC meets television
</P>
<P>
   What operators saw, for example, was Peach Network. An Israeli
company, Peach Network has developed software that uses Explorer to
run PC applications _ from games to word processors _ on television
screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of more months of work and we'll be ready for the
market,'' says Peach Network President Ofir Paz.
</P>
<P>
   Another application nearly ready for prime time is TV Navigator.
Developed by a company called NCI, navigator is based on software
that shrinks a Web page to fit comfortably on a TV screen. This
software also enhances the look of a Web page so that can be easily
read from a distance, such as that between a television and a
couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also watch TV at any time while you're surfing the

Scientific-Atlanta's digital subscriber networks unit. NCI
Navigator does so, Amin explains, by leaving a little box for
television, which users can move around the screen.

<P>
   Many of Scientific-Atlanta's CreativEdge developers are small
start-ups _ but not all. Its members also include giants such as
IBM.
</P>
<P>
   IBM is selling a collection of software tools, branded as
business, through CreativEdge. These tools enable cable operators
to team up with merchants to create virtual online stores capable
of letting viewers use their televisions to browse product catalogs
and buy merchandise. Viewers can also e-mail stores to ask
questions, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to IBM, Scientific-Atlanta has been working with
software giant Microsoft. Scientific-Atlanta is trying to ensure
that Explorer is compatible with both Microsoft's Windows operating
systems and its software.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two companies announced last December a joint
initiative to develop a next generation set-top box that supported
simultaneously both Scientific-Atlanta and Microsoft operating
systems.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Eager to keep his domestic agenda going, President
Clinton flew here Tuesday to call for corporate investment in
inner-city America and said he would tour some of the nation's
pockets of poverty, which he characterized as great economic
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The July tour is to be modeled on the overseas missions that
Cabinet secretaries and corporate officers frequently make to help
American businesses take advantage of emerging markets. Clinton
said that some of America's neglected rural and urban areas
constituted such emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our greatest untapped markets are here at home,'' the
president said at the White House Tuesday morning after a
closed-door session with 15 chief executives of major corporations.
Clinton later brought the executives here for a tour of local
businesses that have profited from federal investment.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton's tour was to take him to Appalachia, the
Mississippi Delta, Indian reservations and aging industrial cities
like Gary, Ind. The aides said he would try to get the executives
to see the tour sites as sources of customers and make substantial
investments in them.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The president's schedule was intended to highlight a portion of
the domestic agenda he laid out when he first campaigned for
president, when he said repeatedly that ``no one should be left
behind.''
</P>
<P>
   With the war in Kosovo, the school shootings in Littleton,
Colo., and other issues now dominating his time in Washington,
Clinton is eager to revive this aspect of his presidency,
particularly as former Sen. Bill Bradley challenges Clinton's
designated heir, Vice President Al Gore, on broad questions of race
and economic equality. Gore spoke extensively with the executives
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the United States is enjoying the biggest economic
expansion in more than three decades. And Clinton noted that in
particular, African-American and Hispanic residents were enjoying
the lowest rates of unemployment since the government began keeping
those statistics. But he said that parts of the country had had no
new investment, no new business and no new jobs, and that 37 cities
had unemployment rates that were double the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of all our prosperity,'' the president said here,
he wanted to point out ``both the obligation and the opportunity we
have to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's support for investment at home was inspired by
the Rev. Jesse Jackson's pleadings in the last year to Wall Street
to encourage private investors, said Gene Sperling, Clinton's
economic adviser. Jackson was not with Clinton on Tuesday but is
supposed to be part of the July tour.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent his day emphasizing that people in poor areas
could succeed if someone invested in those areas, and if they are
aided by federally sponsored tax credits, loan guarantees and
technical support. He is also proposing $1 billion in tax credits
for businesses in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
   He brought the executives with him here on Air Force One for a
round-table discussion staged between stalls at a historic farmers'
market and talked about tax incentives for the so-called
empowerment zones _ areas in the inner city earmarked for economic
initiatives _ but not before cruising for munchies and coming up
with some coffee and sweet potato cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have lifted things from almost every entrepreneur here,''
the president said with a laugh. He said that the woman who gave
him the cheesecake ``destroyed my diet today _ and I loved every
bite of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The market, the Sweet Auburn Curb Street Market, is in Southeast
Atlanta's first black commercial district, not far from the home of
the Rev. Dr Martin Luther King Jr. In operation since 1923, the
market has fallen on hard times over the years and has been aided
with more than $8 million in federal financing.
</P>
<P>
   The market now employs about 800 people in 24 shops. The
president was intrigued by a bin of cows feet and pig ears,
recalling that when Russian President Boris Yeltsin visited him in
Washington, he presented Clinton with a roasted pig and cut off the
ear, telling Clinton he would eat it if he were a true Russian.
</P>
<P>
   Many shop owners said business was slow, and it was not clear
whether the tour inspired any of the executives to want to invest
in the nation's poorer outposts. The executives included
representatives from Bell South, American Airlines, Goldman Sachs,
the Rite Aid Corp., AT&AMP;T Wireless, Delta Airlines, Bankers Trust
and New York Life.
</P>
<P>
   Like the president, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, told the
executives that there was profit to be made in places like this but
only with investment up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, when you look at the inner city, the opportunities
are apparent,'' Campbell said. ``It's access to capital that we
think has been the biggest impediment.''

INTERNET, TECHNOLOGY SHARES LEAD STOCK MARKET HIGHER

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks were buffeted by a further selloff in the bond
market Tuesday but recovered and moved higher, led by technology
and Internet shares.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices fell and long-term interest rates rose to their
highest level in nearly a year after an auction of new five-year
notes was poorly received. Major stock market averages dipped after
the auction results were announced in the afternoon but then
regained some of their footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of concern in the bond market about an
overheated economy and what that means for inflation,'' said Ned
Riley Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston Corp. ``But that
concern seems to be less of an issue in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.90 points, or
two-tenths of a percent, to 11,026.15. But broader market measures
did appreciably better.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressed by sharp gains in America Online, Wal-Mart and Cisco
Systems, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.31 points,
or 1.14 percent, to 1,355.61. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ composite index
rose 40.29 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,566.68. The Russell 2000
index of smaller-company stocks increased 4.96 points, or 1.12
percent, to 446.81.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks sensitive to the business cycle, which have moved sharply
higher over the last month on signs of vigorous economic growth,
surrendered their leadership role Tuesday to the well-known, big
capitalization growth stocks that have been the market's standard
bearers for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper, a Dow component, fell 2 1/4, to 53 7/8.
Allied Signal, another Dow stock, fell 1 3/8, to 63 9/16. And
Georgia-Pacific fell 4 3/16, to 56 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Internet stocks, which have been under selling
pressure over the last few weeks, did much better Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group was led higher by America Online, which surged after
Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's influential Internet
analyst, upgraded the company to ``strong buy'' from
``outperform.'' Later in the session, the company announced that it
would develop an Internet television service with several partners.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which was the most actively traded issue on the
New York Stock Exchange, rose 11 5/16, to 139 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, another big company with important ties to the
Internet, gained 2 5/8, to 111 7/8. After the market closed, the
company posted earnings that were slightly above expectations and
announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Riley and other analysts said the
Cisco earnings report could get technology stocks additional
momentum Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings helped lift the price of Wal-Mart Stores, a
component of both the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500. Wal-Mart gained 2 1/8,
to 47 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise in interest rates, a number of financial
service stocks did well.

HERSANT GROUP SEEKS TO SELL PART OF LE FIGARO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ The Hersant Group, a heavily indebted French newspaper
company, is seeking bids for up to 49 percent of its flagship
paper, Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to divest itself of part of Le Figaro by Hersant,
which controls about 30 percent of French newspaper circulation,
follows the April sale of Hersant's Paris evening paper,
France-Soir, to financier Georges Ghosn, for a symbolic one franc,
about 17 cents. France-Soir had been losing about $1.6 million a
month, and in exchange for the sale Hersant agreed to assume $13.5
million of France-Soir's debt.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Hersant's owners, the family of French press baron
Robert Hersant, who died in 1996, voted to transform Le Figaro into
an independent company with an eye to selling a stake to investors.
</P>
<P>
   French press reports have named as possible buyers Francois
Pinault of Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, who recently bid for a large
stake of the Gucci fashion house and already owns a small share of
the leading daily Le Monde, and Bernard Arnault, the chairman of
the luxury goods maker LVMH.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, The Financial Times of London reported that the Carlyle
Group, a Washington-based takeover firm, was also a potential
investor. Officials at Le Figaro and Carlyle would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Socpresse SA, the Hersant family unit that controls Le Figaro,
is reported to have about $367 million of debt, and has come under
increasing pressure from French banks that are its principal
creditors. Critics often accused Hersant of using easy credit from
what was at the time a state-owned French banking system for his
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the group's debt, Socpresse's chairman, Yves de
Chaise-martin, has been merging some of the group's more than 15
regional newspapers and seeking to shed all or part of the control
of others.
</P>
<P>
   The Hersant Group has been hurt by France's sluggish economy and
the inroads of competing media. Circulation of Le Figaro, France's
leading conservative paper, has dropped to about 360,000 copies,
from 430,000 in 1985, and is reportedly losing about $20 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hersant's idea behind carving Le Figaro into a separate
subsidiary was to increase the paper's capital base and then
reintroduce it as a major competitor to Le Monde, a liberal daily
part-owned by its journalists and the market leader. That project
is a favorite of French conservatives, who value Le Figaro's
potential role in the run-up to presidential elections in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The privately owned Hersant Group began facing financial trouble
even before the death of Hersant _ a secretive, driven man who
built the group up over four decades starting with a motor
magazine. He acquired Le Figaro in 1975 and ran its daily
operations until his death.
</P>
<P>
   A sale of Figaro assets to a non-French investor like Carlyle
would be certain to create intense unhappiness in France, where
newspaper unions are influential and foreign control of more than
20 percent of a news business requires government approval.

   WASHINGTON _ With $13 billion on the table, congressional
negotiators wheeled and dealed Tuesday over emergency bills to
finance battles in the Balkans, military projects for the Pentagon,
disaster victims in Central America, struggling farmers, big
corporations and favored constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two members of the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees, meeting deep into the night around a square table in
the Senate's basement, wrangled over three different emergency
spending measures. The bills contain more than double the money
originally sought by the White House, which threatens to veto the
bill if it becomes laden with political provender unrelated to war
or disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The members battled over $1.1 billion in military money sought
by the House to refurbish overseas bases. ``This is going too
far,'' said the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   They fought over hundreds of millions of dollars in amendments
and riders sponsored by senators to benefit corporate interests and
home-state residents. ``We're not prepared to accept any of them,''
said the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Bill Young,
R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of a deal emerged by nightfall: money for the
bases and the riders may die, and $1.8 billion for the first year
of military pay raise that the Congress and the administration plan
to enact may be removed from the bill, key members said, before the
bill is done. The appropriators may also add $500 million for
tornado and storm victims in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   This all began with bad weather and a war. In February,
President Clinton asked Congress for about $1 billion in disaster
relief for millions of people in Central America and the Caribbean
devastated by last year's hurricanes, which killed 9,000 people and
ruined the lives of thousands of others. In April, he sought $6
billion to pay for the continuing bombing of Yugoslavia and to
assists refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now three main ingredients are in the legislative stew.
</P>
<P>
   One is a $13 billion House bill, which added $7 billion in
Pentagon programs to the White House request for NATO's air war.
Another is a $1.3 billion House disaster relief bill to help the
hurricane victims, which includes White House requests to finance
loans for American farmers and shore up Jordan's role in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The third is a Senate version of the disaster bill, which is $1
billion more expensive than the one passed by the House. That extra
money includes a fourth ingredient: pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   Examples from senators' wish lists include $2 million for a
feasibility study for wood veneer products in Alaska, home of
Stevens; $4 million for forestry research in Alabama, home of Sen.
Richard C. Shelby, a Republican member of the committee; $20
million for three jails for criminal aliens, one in West Virginia,
home of Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the committee's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   They also include royalty rebates and loan guarantees for
industries _ steel, oil, gas and mining interests in senators' home
states _ which add up to $330 million.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, at 81 the acknowledged master of returning federal money
to his home state, joked about the projects he and his fellow
senators sought. ``That great philosopher, Mae West, once said:
``Too much of anything is simply wonderful.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are riders in the Senate bill that may cost no
money, but that the White House contends could exact a political or
social cost.
</P>
<P>
   One is a provision to block the White House from claiming a
share of the states' quarter-billion dollar settlement with the
tobacco industry; President Clinton wants to use some of the money
for federal programs like discouraging children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more narrowly focused, like proposals easing
commercial mining and fishing regulations. Shelby wants to keep the
Alabama sturgeon off the endangered species list, pleasing business
interests, enraging environmentalists and amusing some of his
fellow members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This species was declared extinct, and Senator Shelby
sponsored a study that found some,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio. ``Three. If there are only three, they probably are
endangered.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There remains the question of how to pay for it all.
</P>
<P>
   The likeliest source is surplus Social Security money. But both
political parties have pledged to keep their hands off that money.
So members in both Houses have proposed offsets, or cuts in other
programs, to help foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   These include cutting $827 million from anti-terrorism
activities, $521 million in food stamps, $289 million from
drug-control programs, and $150 million from projects to dispose of
50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium in Russia, enough for 15,000
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The White House budget director, Jacob J. Lew, said Clinton's
senior advisers will recommend a veto unless many of the riders and
cuts are removed or resolved. ``Our goal isn't to have a fight,''
Lew said in an interview. ``Our goal is to have a workable bill
that addresses our concerns.''

sponsored a study that found some,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio. ``Three. If there are only three, they probably are
endangered.''

<P>
   There remains the question of how to pay for it all.
</P>
<P>
   The likeliest source is surplus Social Security money. But both
political parties have pledged to keep their hands off that money.
So members in both Houses have proposed offsets, or cuts in other
programs, to help foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   These include cutting $827 million from anti-terrorism
activities, $521 million in food stamps, $289 million from
drug-control programs, and $150 million from projects to dispose of
50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium in Russia, enough for 15,000
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The White House budget director, Jacob J. Lew, said Clinton's
senior advisers will recommend a veto unless many of the riders and
cuts are removed or resolved. ``Our goal isn't to have a fight,''
Lew said in an interview. ``Our goal is to have a workable bill
that addresses our concerns.''

CANADIAN TOWN HOPES TO PROFIT FROM POLLUTED ENVIRONMENT

<P>
   SYDNEY, Nova Scotia _ The most polluted place in Canada is
chasing a dream that most communities would call a nightmare:
transforming itself into a sort of living laboratory of toxic
waste.
</P>
<P>
   The municipality on northern Cape Breton Island is seeking to
power an economic revival with the very poisons that permeate its
earth and waterways _ and that have defeated every other renewal
and cleanup scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate times call for dramatic solutions,'' said Robert
Morgan, director of research and development at University College
of Cape Breton. ``We're hoping to turn terrible disadvantage into
advantage. If we fail, our community may not survive.''
</P>
<P>
   There is even talk of promoting Sydney as a center for ``reverse
eco-tourism,'' where visitors can ponder the terrible contamination
and ruin that accompanied the triumphs of the industrial age.
</P>
<P>
   There are few communities in North America whose situation is
quite as desperate as that of Sydney and its municipal partners of
Sydney Mines, New Waterford, and Glace Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Backyards in some neighborhoods are saturated with alarming
levels of arsenic and lead. Then, this week, a mysterious orange
substance started oozing into basements. Residents reacted with the
combination of outrage and fatalism that has become standard for
Sydney's inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the arsenic, we have the naphthalene, we have the
lead,'' said Debbie Ouellette, a homemaker. ``The ground is poison,
the air turns your lungs raw, now there is orange goop oozing
across the cellar. Welcome to Sydney.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, this rough-and-ready district of deep
mines, big smokestacks, and blue collars has depended on steel,
coal, and commercial fishing. Now all three industries are
collapsing; umemployment here is at 30 percent and rising. Then,
earlier this year, the federal government announced it would no
longer provide the multimillion dollar subsidies that kept 1,200
coal miners on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   And that devastating blow wasn't even the worst news.
</P>
<P>
   The worst lies in the deadly industrial wastes that glisten and
coil all around Sydney: mountainous slag heaps, rivers of toxic
ooze, acidic fumes that taint the sea breeze, corroded factories
collapsing upon themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It seems almost impossible that such blight could occur on Cape
Breton Island, fabled for its exquisite natural beauty and vibrant
Gaelic heritage. Inhabitants of the island like to boast that no
other place has been more abundantly blessed by God.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast Traveler magazine last year picked Cape Breton as the
most beautiful island in the world, where majestic headlands rise
from the Atlantic spume and seabirds soar in the great vault of
northern sky.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, however, note that few other places on the
planet have been more hideously sullied by man.
</P>
<P>
   Coal mining started in the late 1700s, and Sydney became an
important steel center early this century, attracting thousands of
immigrant workers from Europe and the Caribbean. The Sydney region
still has a multiethnic character that contrasts with the
Scots-Gaelic culture for which the island is famous.
</P>
<P>
   Although a mile-long causeway now links Cape Breton to Nova
Scotia, the island retains an identity distinct from the rest of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never really been absorbed into the mainland culture,''
said Morgan. ``We remain islanders, stubborn, and with a bit of a
chip on our shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet lethal rot has been festering in Cape Breton's
industrial belt for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our cruel reality, poison at the heart of paradise,''
said Carl R. Buchanan, chairman of the Joint Action Group, a
committee of government officials and local residents hoping to
turn Sydney's tide of ill-fortune. ``Cape Breton is a Nova Scotia
masterpiece, people come from everywhere to experience the wonders.
Yet in the middle of Sydney is this cocktail of waste like nowhere
else on the continent.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We can either despair and die, or find an
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many inhabitants are deeply skeptical, a few local
leaders believe that opportunity lurks in Sydney's infamous ``tar
ponds'' _ a tidal estuary in the center of the city packed with
700,000 tons of chemical waste and raw sewage _ as well as in the
hundreds of acres of former industrial sites polluted by millions
of tons of tar, ammonia, oil, benzol, and other byproducts of the
coke yards that once fueled the steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could become an international training ground and research
center for dealing with this kind of environmental challenge,''
said Morgan. ``It's not so far-fetched; we've already begun. The
world could learn from mistakes we've made in Cape Breton _ and
from the way we deal with the mess we've made on our beloved
island.''
</P>
<P>
   Only last September federal, provincial, and local authorities
finally signed an agreement to cooperate in cleaning up the
hazardous waste sites. ``This is going to be the most complex
environmental cleanup ever undertaken in this country, and maybe
anywhere,'' said Buchanan. ``It's never been done on this scale,
and right in the middle of a city.''
</P>
<P>
   The witch's brew is laced by thousands of tons of PCBs and other
potent chemical carcinogens, which number among the many suspects
in a local cancer rate that is 45 percent higher than the Nova
Scotia average, and by far the highest rate in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The tar ponds alone are reckoned by some to be the worst single
toxic waste site in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sydney makes Love Canal seem small and manageable,'' said
Elizabeth E. May, executive director of the Sierra Club of Canada,
referring to the New York toxic site that became a byword for
hazardous waste in the 1980s. ``This is pollution of staggering
dimensions, and thousands of people are still dwelling right in the
belly of the beast.''
</P>
<P>
   On the residential street where Juanita MacKenzie lives, for
example, the air is so rank with the odor of chemicals that the
eyes fill with tears and a metallic taste settles on the tongue. A
chain-link fence separates the backyards where children play from a
sprawling former coke yard, where for decades coal was baked in
mammoth ovens to fire the steel mills.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago health workers, equipped with face masks and
covered head-to-toe in white environmental safety suits, appeared
in Sydney to affix signs to the fence, warning, ``Human Health
Hazard.'' Local residents, who live without special protection and
who had been repeatedly assured by the government that they were in
no special danger, were shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a toxic community,'' said MacKenzie. ``Our children
suffer from asthma, learning disabilities and cancer. There are
days we can hardly breathe. Something has to happen, now.''
</P>
<P>
   The clean-up will be the work of decades and billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fishery is ruined, coal is down, the future of steel is in
question,'' said Germaine LeMoine, spokeswoman for the clean-up
committee. ``We have to work with what we have, and what we have is
this environmental situation. Why not make what we can with it? Why
not find a market for expertise and technology we can develop right
at home?''
</P>
<P>
   The notion is still in the conceptual phase, and to many it
seems outlandish and even diabolical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a scam, a way to keep people's eyes off the real
problem, which is disappearing jobs and a government that doesn't
give two damns about what happens to Cape Breton,'' said Steve
Drake, president of the United Mine Workers local. ``We'll be
tossed a few scraps, then forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   The miners want Ottawa to continue subsidizing the coal works,
even though the $1 billion already pumped into the mines has failed
to restore the industry to its past glory, as was the goal when
public money started flowing a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays even local politicians concede that such economic
dependency does Cape Breton no lasting good.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling in the community that it's time to call in
the dogs, to stop our reliance on those industries,'' the municipal
mayor, David Muise, told the Canadian Press. ``The status quo isn't
going to work here any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The new idea is to transform an ecological sow's ear into an
economic silk purse, making Sydney a place to test new
environmental technologies, to research the effects of pollution,
and to train ecological technicians _ especially from former Soviet
states, Asia and other parts of the developing world, where the
21st century's eco-disasters will loom largest.
</P>
<P>
   Some even tout a proposal to make Sydney a center for ``reverse
eco-tourism,'' allowing visitors to examine firsthand some of the
horrific side effects of poorly managed progress before heading out
to revel in the natural glories that anually attract tens of
thousands of tourists to Cape Breton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can become a center of excellence for the rest of the
world,'' said LeMoine. ``In overcoming our problems, we can develop
tools, techniques, and expertise that we can provide to other
places. The world can come to us and learn.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Suddenly, America's space rockets seem to be
failing, blowing up or losing payloads at an alarming rate that has
experts questioning the prowess of an increasingly competitive
satellite launching industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the last nine months, there have been six significant
failures of U.S. rockets trying to put civilian and military
payloads into orbit. The mishaps, involving both older, usually
reliable rockets and newly designed spacecraft, have resulted in
losses totaling $3.5 billion and shaken confidence in the ability
of the United States to launch space missions, including crucial
communications and spy satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers studying the problem say they cannot tell if the
recent difficulties are just bad luck or signs of systemic problems
in the launching business. A number of explanations have been
floated to explain the string of disasters, ranging from an
over-reliance on computer models in place of flight testing to the
pressures to do more for less money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance we've demonstrated since last August is
unacceptable, to us and to our customers,'' said Peter B. Teets,
the president and chief operating officer of Lockheed Martin, whose
rockets are responsible for the loss of four satellites since
August. ``The worst impact on morale is losing a mission,'' Teets
said. ``We have good people who are not feeling very well right
now.''.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Willacker of Aerospace Corp., a private consulting and
engineering research company based in El Segundo, Calif., said the
nation's space launching industry was suffering from being under
the competing pressures of flying more rockets at less cost while
also trying to introduce new boosters that are even more
economical.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite launching business is booming, with an
unprecedented number of customers in science, communications and
other industries clamoring to get their payloads into space. At the
same time, there is great pressure to reduce the cost of
launchings, with American companies being forced to compete with
low-cost launching services being offered by Europe's Ariane
rockets and boosters available in Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is a little stretched, and this pressure is
contributing to some systematic problems,'' Willacker, head of the
consulting company's space launching operations, said in an
interview. ``I have a hard time believing there can be this much
bad luck in a row without there being some common threads,'' he
said. ``We must find them and straighten them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, the troubles are causing apprehension for
rocket users as well as flight delays while engineers sort out the
problems to determine whether future missions are in danger. With
some three dozen military and civilian launchings scheduled from
the United States, this is a particularly busy year for the
American launching industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has indefinitely postponed the flight of a giant
Titan IV rocket, which has failed three times in its last three
launchings and which was to carry a secret spy satellite into space
early this month from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. This
delay, in turn, prevents the scheduled launching of an older
rocket, the Titan II, from an adjacent pad. The Titan II is
supposed to orbit a NASA science spacecraft called Quikscat.
</P>
<P>
   And NASA has pushed back the scheduled July 22 flight of the
space shuttle Columbia, which is to carry the $1.5 billion Chandra
X-ray Observatory into space. An attached booster rocket that is to
drive the observatory into its final orbit is the same type as one
that malfunctioned last month.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency is going ahead with plans for a July launching
of Terra, a billion-dollar satellite that is the flagship of NASA's
Earth Observing System to monitor global changes, even though the
upper stage of its carrier rocket, a Centaur, is identical to one
that misfired last month and doomed a military communications
satellite. But a spokesman said NASA was monitoring the military
investigation to see if it uncovered concerns that might affect the
launching of the Terra.
</P>
<P>
   The current string of mishaps began last Aug. 12 when a Titan
IV, the most powerful rocket used by the military, exploded 41
seconds after liftoff, destroying an $800 million communications
intelligence satellite along with the $340 million rocket. An Air
Force review board blamed damaged electrical wires that were not
detected before the flight.
</P>
<P>
   The two other Titan IV setbacks, at a cost of about $1 billion
each, occurred in April, apparently for dissimilar reasons. On
April 9, an upper stage deployed from the Titan as expected, but
apparently parts of it failed to separate properly between multiple
firings, putting a missile warning satellite in a useless orbit.
This booster, made by the Boeing Co. and called the Inertial Upper
Stage, is the same type that is to propel NASA's Chandra
observatory.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And on April 30, a different upper stage, the Centaur,
malfunctioned and put a military communications satellite in an
orbit thousands of miles too low, where it is doubtful it can ever
be used.
</P>
<P>
   The trade journal Aviation Week and Space Technology reported in
its May 10 issue that the Centaur went awry nine minutes into the
mission because of inaccuracies in computer flight software from
the rocket's maker, the Lockheed Martin Corp. The errant software
was loaded before the flight, and problems went undetected by the
company's normal verification process, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Botched launchings also affected civilian space missions:
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 26, Boeing's new Delta III rocket exploded 71 seconds
after liftoff on its maiden voyage, destroying the Galaxy 10
communications satellite in a $225 million disaster caused by a
design error in its first-stage guidance system.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, the Athena II, a relatively new small rocket made
by Lockheed Martin Corp., failed to place a private earth-imaging
satellite into orbit after launching from Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California. A 1,300-pound protective payload shroud failed to
separate from the $25 million rocket, dragging the satellite back
down into the atmosphere, where it burned up.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, the second-stage of another Boeing Delta III rocket
did not fire long enough after restarting in space, putting a $145
million Orion communications satellite into a lopsided orbit
thousands of miles too low to be useful. Controllers are looking
into ways to salvage some of the $230 million mission by using some
of the satellite's internal fuel to nudge it higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force announced on May 6 that it and the National
Reconnaissance Office, which deploys spy satellites, would conduct
a broad review of military launching capability and the Titan
failures. Lockheed Martin, which makes the Titans, as well as the
Centaur upper stage and the Athena rocket, also announced it was
appointing an independent panel of experts to examine the
procedures of its rocket business.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Richard B. Myers of the Air Force, who is commander of the
U.S. Space Command, said the loss of three new military satellites
since August because of launching failures did not jeopardize
current military operations but could affect future readiness if
problems are not corrected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because these failures have cost us a great deal in financial
terms and in future mission capability, we are working hard to
identify their causes,'' Myers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Teets of Lockheed Martin said: ``My gut feeling is that we're
having a very unlucky period right now and that our basic
operations are sound. But we want this outside committee to see if
there is something going on here, something fundamental, that we
can't see on a case-to-case basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gale Schluter, executive vice president of Boeing's rocket
systems division, said troubles with the new Delta III appeared to
be birthing problems of a largely new design and not a breakdown in
normal operations at the company. He noted that Boeing's smaller,
older Delta II had accumulated a 97.5 percent success rate over 10
years, showing that the company knew how to produce quality
rockets. ``We are looking at the Delta III comprehensively,'' he
said, ``We want to understand the two failures better and deal with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Willacker of the Aerospace Corporation said the rocket business
suffered from too few experienced engineers and technicians,
particularly those at midcareer, who are being stretched across too
many projects.
</P>
<P>
   A dearth in hiring in the industry in the early 1980s has
resulted in a cadre of well-educated new engineers in their 20s and
early 30s and a seasoned group over age 55 who are approaching
retirement, Willacker said, but few in the gap between these
clusters.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem, Willacker said, is an overreliance on computer
simulation and modeling in creating new products and a reduction in
testing actual hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, you would build test aircraft or rockets and fly
them before you commit to production,'' Willacker said. ``We seem
to have convinced ourselves that we don't need that luxury today,
and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Schluter, of Boeing, said his company does a lot of testing at
the component and subsystem level and is highly confident in its
results, but he acknowledged that this analytical approach ``gets
risky'' when used for a complete vehicle. This has led to
discussion over firing ``test rounds'' of new rockets without
paying cargo, which is expensive for the manufacturer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willacker of the Aerospace Co. said his group kept a database on
all spaceflights and found that there had been about 60 significant
launch failures since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``When looking for common factors, we were somewhat surprised,''
he said. ``We worry a lot about electronics and computers, but the
most prominent factors were hardware _ propulsion and ordinance
systems.'' This means rocket engines and fuel systems with their
varied manufactured parts, he said, and explosive bolts, springs
and other mechanisms for separating rocket stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the kinds of things we should know how to make and
operate well,'' he said. ``It's manufacturing and quality control.
Not a lot of this is real rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   Several space historians said the recent run of ill fortune
reminded them of a period in the mid-1980s when everything seemed
to go wrong. The calamities included the explosion of the space
shuttle Challenger, resulting in the loss of its seven-member crew;
the back-to-back failures of two Titan rockets and the destruction
of a pair of military reconnaissance satellites; and an Atlas
rocket being struck by lightning in flight, destroying a Navy
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Space launch vehicles are inherently unreliable and people
should understand that this is still risky business,'' said John E.
Pike, an expert on civilian and military space programs with the
Federation of American Scientists. ``I'm prepared to believe we
have had an extraordinary run of bad luck,'' he said, ``but when
you have something like the Titan IV failures, where there have
been three in a row, you wonder if it's more than bad luck.''

SALIVATING OVER HOT WINGS COULD HAVE STARS SINGING BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Stars are playing St. Louis, but are they
thinking Detroit? Give it a week, and ``Red Wingitis'' could be
both rampant and useful. But if it's happening now, then that's a
dangerous disease.
</P>
<P>
   Quizzed on that point yesterday, the Stars' players, to the man,
responded as expected. As in, there has not been, nor will be, any
peeping past St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But general manager Bob Gainey, an old soldier who fought many a
Stanley Cup war, didn't exactly dismiss the possibility as pivotal
Game 4 of this second-round series approached Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's there, it's logical, the thought is floating around, and
it has to be dealt with individually and collectively among our
group,'' he said when asked about any concern over premature ``Red
Wingitis.''
</P>
<P>
   And after the Blues had rescued Game 3 here Monday night,
cutting the Stars' series lead to two games to one, some of the St.
Louis players seemed puzzled. There were indications they didn't
think they had yet seen the Stars' best game, which again hints of
a Detroit thing.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, no one from the Stars' side disagrees, starting with
coach Ken Hitchcock. To most of us, it's been inevitable that the
Stars and Red Wings would meet in the Western Conference finals,
and decide the Stanley Cup winner then and there. But Hitch began
verbally banging on his team after the Game 3 loss. And that theme
continued yesterday. Plus, the soft-spoken Gainey also joined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of year, it's a daily and constant exercise to
keep the focus in the right area,'' Gainey said. ``But for us,
that's not anything new. From Day One of this season, the
expectations for our team have always been different from where we
are, or where we were.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a team built with Tom Hicks' money, Gainey's
expertise and Hitchcock's coaching is expected to bring home the
Stanley Cup, or else.
</P>
<P>
   In winning the first six playoff games, various warts were easy
to cover. But the Stars' loss Monday night quickly brought the
spotlight down on such areas as the folly of the power-play unit,
or the latest lack of production from the Mike Modano line. And
then there has also been the Detroit phobia to consider.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, the Red Wings have been the most impressive
team in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, that's been noticed,'' Gainey said of the Red Wings'
playoff run. ``And at the same time, everyone needs to recognize
we've got a tiger by the tail in St. Louis. When it's December or
January, and you're talking about the playoffs, the importance
doesn't mean much. But once you are here, it comes down to a
step-by-step process. Our step right now is the semifinals. A very
good and competitive series is happening with St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   A random poll of club officials and NHL scouts indicated the
Stars played well enough in the Edmonton series to defeat Detroit.
But the kicker is no one who was asked yesterday felt any of the
performances against St. Louis thus far were up to Red Wings'
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the second period against St. Louis in Game 3 was an
absolute embarrassment. The Blues scored only once in that
20-minute barrage but still changed the course of the game.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side for the Stars, they've been strong in the third
period in all seven postseason contests; have bounced back to tie
the score in five of them; and Jere Lehtinen will return for Game
4, as might Guy Carbonneau.
</P>
<P>
   Lehtinen was injured early in the second period Monday night and
missed the remainder of the game. Carbonneau has yet to play in
this series because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, the third-period composure over seven playoff games
is a healthy trend. What Game 4 will reveal is what kind of
jump-start, if any, did losing Monday night provide for the Stars.
If there was ``Red Wingitis,'' has it now been cured?
</P>
<P>
   And in taking note of Detroit's postseason roll, Gainey recalled
when the Soviet National team made its first visit to North America
in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were playing that series against them, we used to
practice in the same arenas,'' Gainey said. ``To watch them skate
in practice, the first thought was we can't beat them. They were
that skilled.
</P>
<P>

resistance against that skill, and it wasn't as difficult as it had
looked watching them in practice.''

   Yes, Detroit has been mighty, but first things first. The Blues
are gaining momentum in this series. For the Stars, what happens
next doesn't matter. This is all about what happens now. nn

COWBOYS KEEP MILLS WITH THREE-YEAR DEAL (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys reached an agreement with
free-agent wide receiver Ernie Mills on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-year deal is worth 2.275 million, including a $375,000
signing bonus, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Under terms of the deal, Mills would get a $400,000 base salary in
1999, a $300,000 roster bonus in June of 2000, a $400,000 base in
2000 and an $800,000 base in 2001, the source said.
</P>
<P>
   The last year of the contract is voidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's happy in Dallas and wanted to stay there,'' said
Mills' agent, Doug Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who is entering his ninth NFL season, caught 28 passes
for 479 yards and four touchdowns last season. He suffered a
lacerated small intestine Nov. 22 against Seattle and missed the
final five regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to be the Cowboys' third receiver in 1999 behind
Michael Irvin and Raghib Ismail. LaFLEUR FRACTURES ANKLE
</P>
<P>
   Starting tight end David LaFleur fractured his right ankle in a
morning workout Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys officials, however, said they are confident LaFleur will
be back in time for the start of training camp July 26. He is
expected to be in a cast three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   LaFleur, a third-year veteran, missed the final three games last
season with a sprained right knee. DAVIS BANNED
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Billy Davis' absence from the Cowboys'
twice-a-week workouts is quite telling about his future. Davis, who
is under contract, was told his presence at the workouts weren't
necessary and was banned from using the Cowboys' facilities for
personal workouts, said a source close to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' name no longer adorns a locker in the team locker room.
He is expected to be released, but the Cowboys benefit under the
salary cap if they wait until June 1. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The Cowboys signed rookie cornerback Kevin Brooks from the
University of South Carolina to a free-agent contract.

 &HT;    Family will Ham it up at convention
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Dick Miller used to be the only amateur radio
operator in his family, but then the Ham bug bit his wife, then his
son-in-law and his daughter, then the other daughter and her
husband and it kept going from there. Now 14 family members are
licensed ham radio operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sort of spreading down the family tree. It's kind of
unusual because a lot of other hams ask me how I got my kids to be
hams. I don't know. I didn't bug them,'' said Miller, general
chairman of Hamvention '99, the amateur radio show at Hara Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day my wife came out to my ham shack and said, 'If you
die, what am I going to do with all this stuff?' And I said 'You
have two choices: sell it or get your license.' She got her
license,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Then about 13 years ago, Miller took his son-in-law, Mark
Denlinger, to Hamvention and next thing he knew nearly everyone in
the family was getting his or her ham license.
</P>
<P>
   The Miller Family will be at Hamvention 99 Friday through Sunday
in full force, along with 28,000 other ham radio enthusiasts from
across the United States and from 50 foreign countries. The 48th
annual Hamvention features 1,500 vendors sprawled across Hara's
parking lots in an open air flea market where shoppers can get the
latest gizmos, hard-to-find parts and other items. Indoors, another
250 manufacturers display their wares and seminars and forums are
held.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the market and seminars at Hara Arena, Hamvention
will hold a banquet and concert at the Nutter Center on Saturday.
Joe Walsh, 51, best known from his work as a guitarist with The
Eagles and The James Gang, will perform beginning around 8:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a an amateur radio operator _ a very avid one. He was
glad to do it to support amateur radio,'' Miller said of Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Banquet-concert tickets are $40 while the 6,000 general
admission concert tickets are $20 apiece. Tickets are available at
the Hara and Nutter box offices and Ticketmaster outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Hamvention, which is sponsored by the Dayton Amateur Radio
Association Inc., is expected to have a $3.4 million economic
impact on Montgomery County, officials estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hamvention's attendance figures have been trailing in
recent years, Miller said previous crowd counts may have been
inaccurate. But new tracking systems will provide accurate counts
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ham radio may be taking a side seat to the Internet where people
connect through web pages and e-mail messages. But Miller said the
Internet just doesn't have the same thrill as talking live to
people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a techie to get your (ham) license or to
enjoy it. You can be from any walk of life,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamvention '99 Days: Friday through May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Hara Arena, 1001 Shiloh Springs Road, Trotwood, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets: $16 in advance for a three-day pass (no single-day
tickets available); $20 at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Parking: Free parking at Dayton Mall and Salem Mall with free
shuttle buses to Hara. Limited parking in lots on Wolf Road at $5
to $10 a day.
</P>

CHRONICLE PUBLISHING MAY BE PLANNING TO SELL ASSETS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Calif., Neb., Kan.)  (bl) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The family that owns Chronicle Publishing Co. in San Francisco
has called in the investment bank of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
to evaluate its assets and advise it on possible financial
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers, though not all, say this means that the company
is preparing to sell The San Francisco Chronicle, the country's
11th-largest newspaper, and KRON, the NBC affiliate in the
country's fifth-largest television market, along with two other
television stations, two publishing companies and two smaller
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an announcement like this is made, it generally ends up
in a sale,'' said P. Anthony Ridder, the chairman and chief
executive of Knight Ridder, whose San Jose Mercury News competes
with The Chronicle in the Silicon Valley area south of San
Francisco Bay, and whose Contra Costa newspapers are battling The
Chronicle for suburban readers east of San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The future of The Chronicle, a morning paper with a circulation
of about 475,000, and its afternoon rival, The San Francisco
Examiner, which has a circulation of about 111,000, has been a
subject of speculation for years. The two newspapers are part of a
joint operating agreement that started in 1965 and is scheduled to
run until 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But since that agreement took effect, both newspapers have found
themselves gradually losing suburban readership in the sprawling
Bay area. Aside from the Knight Ridder papers, the Alameda
Newspaper Group east of the Bay is owned by one of the industry's
most aggressive competitors, William Dean Singleton, the chief
executive of Media News Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Ridder said any buyer would find the various assets
of Chronicle Publishing ``very attractive properties.'' Various
industry observers valued the company's total assets at well over
$1 billion. It is not clear, however, if one company could buy both
The Chronicle and KRON. Chronicle Publishing has a waiver from the
Federal Communications Commission rule that prohibits
cross-ownership of a major newspaper and television station in the
same market, but a buyer might not get the same waiver.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely suitor for all or part of Chronicle Publishing's
assets would be its rival, Hearst Corp., which owns The Examiner.
Under the terms of their joint operating agreement, the two
newspapers share business operations but run separate, and highly
competitive, newsrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which runs the shared
advertising and production operations of the two newspapers, has
about 3,200 employees, about 1,000 of whom are represented by at
least 10 separate unions. Despite its status as the junior member
of the operation, by size, the owners of The Examiner have always
taken an aggressive public stance, declaring that they have no
intention of shutting the operation at which William Randolph
Hearst first tried his hand as a newspaper publisher in the late
19th century.
</P>
<P>
   George Irish, the president and group head of Hearst Newspapers,
declined Tuesday to comment on the Chronicle announcement, which
was made by Chronicle Publishing chief executive John Sias in a
news release Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sias is not a member of the extended family that owns the paper
and has had internecine battles for two decades. The descendants of
the two DeYoung brothers, who started The Daily Dramatic Chronicle
in San Francisco in 1865, have publicly wrangled over control of
the newspaper and the company's board several times in the last
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Chronicle Publishing is privately held. It owns the Chronicle,
the Bloomington Pantagraph in Illinois and the Worcester Telegram
in Massachusetts.

U.S. REJECTS CALL TO STOP YUGOSLAV ATTACK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China and Russia called on NATO Tuesday to halt its
air campaign against Yugoslavia in the wake of the mistaken bombing
of the Chinese Embassy, but the United States rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue with prosecuting the air campaign
until the NATO conditions are met, and that alone will be the cause
of any suspension of the bombing,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin and they agreed that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization must stop its attacks against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's forces before peace talks begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main principle is to stop the bombing,'' Chernomyrdin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin also urged the Chinese not to block a U.N.
Security Council resolution that Russia and the seven world
economic powers crafted last week that would demand Milosevic
remove his troops and allow an international security force into
Kosovo to protect the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, in his first comments about the embassy bombing, called
it a ``provocation'' against the people of China. Jiang has not
responded to a letter sent by Clinton on Sunday that apologized and
offered to discuss the incident by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has demonstrated the enthusiasm, will and power of the
great patriotism of the Chinese people,'' the media reported Jiang
as telling Chernomyrdin. ``The whole country is now determined to
study and work harder, so as to develop the national economy
continuously, enhance national strength, and fight back with
concrete deeds against the barbaric act of U.S.-led NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese media reported for the first time about the apology made
by President Clinton and NATO. The protests that have made
Ambassador James Sasser a hostage in the embassy appeared to ebb.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview with NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, Sasser
said there were only a few hundred protesters compared to 10,000
Sunday. ``We're not getting nearly as many rocks thrown at us, and
the crowds are much smaller,'' Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police escorted only small numbers of protesters to the
embassy and prevented them from carrying rocks. Sasser said the
front of the embassy looks ``like a war zone'' after three days of
peltings by rocks. Sasser also said he and staff members so feared
the embassy would be overrun Sunday that they began destroying
sensitive information and disabling machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The roiling of Sino-American relations began Friday when a B-2
Stealth bomber attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade based on
faulty information. The Central Intelligence Agency conceded using
an old map of Belgrade that did not include the location of the
Chinese Embassy, which moved to a newer facility in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, appearing before a Senate
appropriations subcommittee, said the Chinese government inflamed
passions by suggesting the embassy bombing was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between righteous indignation and
calculated exploitation,'' Cohen said of China's actions. Cohen
again explained the bombing resulted from an ``intelligence
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also disputed Belgrade's claim that some Yugoslavian
troops are being withdrawn after completing their mission to rid
Kosovo of rebels. Troops stormed into the Serbian province in March
and uprooted nearly 1.3 million of the 1.7 million ethnic Albanians
that make up the majority. More than 700,000 have fled to Albanian
and Macedonian refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one, we have seen no evidence of any partial pullout,
and number two, a partial pullout would mean a total victory for
him,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense chief repeated NATO demands that Milosevic withdraw
all his forces. NATO wants Yugoslavia to allow the return of the
Kosovar refugees and allow an international security force into the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen appeared before the Senate panel as Congress prepares to
vote on Clinton's request for $6 billion to fund the United States'
cost of the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   The House nearly doubled the president's request as it offered
the Pentagon more money while the Senate also had added a series of
pork-barrel projects. Clinton has threatened to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   NATO operations have intensified in recent days as warplanes
aimed at nearly two dozen targets in Serbia and Kosovo. NATO also
reported Yugoslavian forces appeared to be continuing firefights
with Kosovar rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that there is no pause in NATO's operation Allied
Force, which now enters its 49th day,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Shea also said he hoped China would ``work constructively with
Russia'' to pass a U.N. resolution calling on Milosevic to accept
the conditions reached by NATO, Russia and seven world economic
powers.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
made her fourth direct appeal to Serbs, the ethnic majority in the
Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this conflict is over, good and decent Serbs will be
appalled at what has been done in your name,'' Albright said. She
also dismissed the comments of one Yugoslavian government official
who said the ethnic Albanians were paid actors in a NATO-directed
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see a democratic Serbia enter modern Europe and
join the community of Euro-Atlantic democracies. That is where you
truly belong. But first, you must put the ugly specter of `ethnic
cleansing,' this dark chapter from Europe's past, behind you once
and for all,'' she said.

YUGOSLAVIA ASKS WORLD COURT TO ORDER A HALT TO NATO BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-NATO) 
(nk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ A parallel fight to the war in Kosovo
is taking place here at the International Court of Justice, where
Yugoslavia is asking for a legal order against 10 NATO nations to
halt the bombing, and the NATO members are responding with scorn.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the suit has coincided with Yugoslavia's assertion
that it is withdrawing part of its forces from Kosovo, and some
international lawyers and diplomats suggest that the troop
announcement may have been intended to help bolster Belgrade's case
in court.
</P>
<P>
   In the grandiose Hall of Justice of the Peace Palace here,
Yugoslavia told a panel of 20 judges that the NATO bombings of its
territory over the last seven weeks had violated the U.N. charter,
the Geneva Conventions and several human rights treaties and that
the attacks constituted genocide.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade demands that the international court, the highest
judicial body of the United Nations, issue an injunction telling
the NATO countries to end their attacks immediately and ordering
them to pay compensation for all the damage done. Belgrade has
filed separate complaints against each of the 10 countries involved
in the NATO attacks. It cannot sue NATO because this court deals
only with disputes between nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government seems to give enormous importance to its
lawsuit. Belgrade has included eight professors of international
law in its delegation, six of them non-Serbs from Western
universities.
</P>
<P>
   The British government, so far the most outspoken champion of
NATO's actions, has also underscored that it takes the lawsuit
seriously by sending Attorney General John Morris to argue its
case.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings in Yugoslavia's lawsuit against the 10 NATO nations
began on Monday morning, just hours before Belgrade announced that
it would pull back part of its forces. The sessions continued
Tuesday when several NATO countries responded.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 NATO countries in their replies have all mocked
Yugoslavia's claim, calling it cynical and absurd, while denouncing
its crimes in Kosovo. The United States said Tuesday that
Belgrade's suit was ``a feat of hypocrisy and cynicism of Orwellian
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 NATO countries have also argued that the International
Court of Justice has no jurisdiction in this case for various
reasons, one of them being that Yugoslavia is not a member of the
United Nations. After the breakup of Yugoslavia, the United Nations
told the various parts to re-apply for membership, but Serbia and
Montenegro have refused to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the United States and Britain, the other eight
countries involved in the lawsuit are Belgium, Canada, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the NATO governments dismissed Yugoslavia's case, some
international law experts gathered here have argued that Belgrade
is at least partly on solid legal ground. They say NATO has indeed
sought no U.N. approval for its attack on Yugoslavia while the
``humanitarian intervention'' that NATO says it is carrying out is
still at best a very tenuous concept in international law.
</P>
<P>
   But legal scholars here have also remarked that Yugoslavia is
bringing its case to the Peace Palace, which is less than half a
mile from another U.N. court, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal,
which Belgrade refuses to recognize. It has consistently scoffed at
the indictments and arrest warrants issued by the tribunal and of
late it has even refused to accept tribunal documents.

SONY, FOLLOWING UNIVERSAL, TO SELL DIGITAL MUSIC ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sony Music Entertainment says it will begin selling songs online
in digital form using Microsoft technology, accelerating the rush
of record companies to the Internet even before the industry
settles on a common standard.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's plan, being announced Wednesday, follows an announcement
last week by the largest record company, Universal Music, that it
would distribute music online in digital form by the end of the
year. The moves indicate the companies' eagerness to take advantage
of the growing electronic commerce market.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said that as early as midsummer it plans to begin selling
singles from its artists, who include Mariah Carey, Celine Dionne
and Will Smith. Prices will be comparable to those of singles
purchased in retail stores, said Fred Ehrlich, general manager for
new technology and business development for Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Sony said it would use Microsoft's Windows Media 4.0, a
technology to compress music into digital form, store it and make
it available for download. It is among a handful of alternatives to
MP3, a format widely used on the Internet to download music but
loathed by the music industry because it lacks safeguards against
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows Media 4.0 technology will permit songs to be
downloaded through the Internet and stored or copied to a computer
hard disk, compact disk or floppy disk. But the software will
prevent songs from being played unless the user pays for them or
meets other licensing agreements, said Will Poole, senior director
of marketing and business development for Microsoft's streaming
media division.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry has created a consortium called the Secure
Digital Music Initiative to create standards by June 30 for
distributing music digitally _ standards that electronics makers
can then use for portable digital music devices.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich said Sony was not seeking to break ranks with the
consortium and would wait until the June standards are released
before beginning to sell music digitally. ``It doesn't hurt the
record industry to try to establish relationships in anticipation''
of the standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Sony would sell only singles at the outset because most
consumers do not yet have the high-speed connections that would
make downloading an album practical.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nathanson, an international media analyst for Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co., a New York-based investment research and
management company, said the agreement provided a major boost for
Microsoft's technology, which record companies had been slow to
embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Music, for example, is using competing software from
Intertrust Technologies Corp. of Sunnyvale, Calif. Microsoft
unveiled its software last month and plans a final version by
summer.

 Making Web Searches Easier
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  Hunting for information online about starting and
financing a business can be very frustrating. It is easy to get
lost or overwhelmed. Are there ways to narrow the search and get
more targeted information?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer:  &LR; You have identified one of the common problems of Web
searches. It's sometimes like finding something in the dark. You
know it's there but it's hard putting your fingers on it.
</P>
<P>
   However, there are increasingly smart online search services. In
fact, two of them are local companies that got financing in the
past quarter and are planning public stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Looksmart.com ( &LR; www.looksmart.com &LR; ) has 140
editorial staff who review hundreds of thousands of Web sites and
list them by neat categories. For example, you can hit the Business
&AMP; Finance tab and get a menu of everything from business
professions to U.S. regional businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the Small Business tab and get another dozen categories such
as Advice &AMP; Guides, Home Business and Venture Capital. Click
Venture Capital and up pops a list of information sources with
two-line descriptions of the site as well as links to the home
pages of scores of alphabetically listed VC firms.
</P>
<P>
   Under Government &AMP; Law, there are links to the U.S. Small
Business Administration and most sites of interest to
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley's Ask Jeeves Inc. ( &LR; www.askjeeves.com &LR; ) answers more
than 1 million questions a day from Internet users who can pose
their queries in plain English rather than typing in single words
or setting them apart with instructions parameters AND or NOT.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ask ``Where can I find venture capital?'' and Ask
Jeeves responds with five related questions that you can click to
get more information: These include ``Where can I find a list of
venture capitalists?'' and ``Where can I find advice on how to
obtain venture capital?''
</P>
<P>
   However, ask a complicated question like ``What venture capital
firms specialize in Internet startups?'' and Ask Jeeves is often
stumped.
</P>
<P>
   Registration a Business
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have an Internet consulting business that is planning to
incorporate and I wonder if I need a city business license to do
something as mundane as open a business bank/checking account?
People want to give us checks made out to the business and we have
not set this up.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: Get thee to City Hall. It sounds like you are operating a
business and getting paid for services without registering with the
city.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco requires that all businesses located within the
city and county file for a Business Tax Registration Certificate
within 15 days of starting business. The annual charge is just $25
if gross receipts are below $15,000 and you have no employees. For
businesses with employees, the fee runs from $150 to $500 depending
on how much they pay in taxes. The certificate must be renewed by
October 31 for the following calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco taxpayer assistance officer Peter Chou suggests
that you go to San Francisco City Hall, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett
Place. Check in with the county clerk's office in Room 168 to see
if the fictitious business name you plan to use is available.
</P>
<P>
   Then go to the tax collector's office, Room 140, and fill out
the application, register the name and pay the fee. The business
license is mailed out approximately 10 days after the payment is
received.
</P>
<P>
   For more information call (415) 554-4400 or visit the Web site
 &LR; www.ci.sf.ca.us/tax &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   You should also verify that the area in which you wish to do
business is zoned for that purpose. Zoning information can be
obtained from the Zoning and Planning Department at 1660 Mission
St. Their phone number is (415) 558-6377.

ADVERTISING: GM COMMITTED TO OLYMPICS CAMPAIGN DESPITE SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Other companies may be shying away from Olympic
sponsorships after the bribery scandal involving the Winter Games
in Salt Lake City, but General Motors Corp. is stepping up its
advertising and marketing plans.
</P>
<P>
   GM, which had already committed to a 10-year sponsorship worth
roughly $900 million, is now concentrating on getting the biggest
bang for its big bucks. Tuesday it announced new marketing efforts
on several fronts: it will give cars and trucks to aspiring Olympic
athletes, then advertise the gifts; it has committed to Olympic
sponsorships with all NBC owned-and-operated stations through 2008,
and it plans to link specific vehicles with certain sports for
promotional purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Some promotions will begin as early as June, and all are
intended to take advantage of the sponsorship deals not just during
the two weeks of the Games but for the months running up to the
Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, next year and the years before
the Winter Games in Salt Lake City in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, General Motors is running the long-term sponsorship and
advertising campaign much like a political campaign. Its marketing
decisions have been based on near-constant telephone polling about
its customers' interests, said Philip Guarascio, vice president for
advertising and corporate marketing at GM.
</P>
<P>
   Those polled after the bribery scandal told GM that the
company's Olympic sponsorship would not taint their view of the
company. That is mostly because the scandal did not involve
athletes. GM felt comfortable moving forward because its polls
found that people differentiated between ``the business side and
the sports side'' of the Olympics, Guarascio said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies have been more concerned about the scandal.
Several corporate sponsors met to discuss the subject, and one
longtime sponsor, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., demanded
a number of changes from the Olympic Committee. Johnson &AMP; Johnson,
which had been considering spending $30 million on a sponsorship,
decided to stick with donating some products and advertising. While
the scandal was not the company's main concern, ``it was more than
likely part of the backdrop'' of the decision, said John McKeegan,
a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic officials conceded that the scandal had hurt their
efforts to sell the Games to corporations. ``Certainly it has
slowed down the sale of some of our sponsorships,'' said John
Krimsky, deputy secretary general and managing director for
business affairs for the U.S. Olympic Committee. However, he said
things were picking up again. ``We have put that behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Network television said it had no problems. ``We've been pretty
much untouched,'' said NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol, who along
with Krimsky was in Detroit for GM's announcement Tuesday. ``We've
continued to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Olympics are such a high-profile and one-of-a-kind
marketing platform, marketing experts agreed, the Games will have
no trouble raising enough money from companies. ``Olympic
sponsorships are not going to go begging,'' said Paul Argenti, a
corporate communications professor at the Amos Tuck School of
Business Administration at Dartmouth College. Even though some
companies, particularly those that go to great lengths to emphasize
squeaky clean corporate images, might worry about being tainted by
association with the scandal, forgoing an Olympic sponsorship poses
problems, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no other event quite like it anywhere in the world,''
Argenti said. ``You're there because your competitors will be there
if you're not.'' Others believe that the Olympics stature has
temporarily been diminished ``when something like the bribery
scandal rocks the very core of what this event stands for,'' said
C.B. Bhattacharya, an associate professor of marketing at Boston
University. What GM is counting on is that ``come the excitement of
the Olympics, nobody will remember the bribery scandal and the
sports will take over.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the scandal involved those wearing suits, the effect for
companies considering sponsorships is not as strong as it might be.
``This particular scandal doesn't involve athletes,'' said Clive
Chajet, who runs Chajet Consultancy, a corporate identity firm
based in New York. ``If races were fixed, if big countries were
favored over small countries, then people would care.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some lingering effects, but none are keeping the
Olympics from reaching their financial goals, said David Ogrean,
the U.S. Olympic committee's new deputy executive director for
marketing. ``There are a lot of folks who have been in the pipeline
who have just decided not to move the conversations forward for a
while until the dust settles,'' Ogrean said. ``There are some
companies that may be using the opportunity to do a little
negotiating'' to pay less for the sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   Still, three years before the Salt Lake City Games, corporate
sponsors have already committed to two-thirds of the $850 million
fund-raising goal, Ogrean said.
</P>
<P>
   A big chunk of that came from General Motors, and the company
displayed its resulting influence Tuesday. Not only Ebersol,
Krimsky and Ogrean were called to Detroit to sing the company's
praises, but NBC sportscaster Bob Costas was the emcee of GM's news
conference announcing the new developments.
</P>
<P>
   Designer Joseph Abboud was summoned to the Motor City because he
will be customizing the cars to be given to Olympic athletes. Most
strikingly, Olympic medalists Dorothy Hamill, Evelyn Ashford,
Kristi Yamaguchi and Carl Lewis were on hand to praise GM for
giving away cars. The Olympians will help choose which athletes get
the free cars.

CHINA, RUSSIA SEE BOMBING HALT NECESSARY STEP TO PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chinese and Russian leaders agreed Tuesday that
NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia must stop before peace negotiations
can be held, but NATO and US officials insisted there would be no
pause in the air campaign until all their conditions are met for
halting persecution of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While protests outside the US Embassy in Beijing and other
American facilities in China abated substantially, official anger
at last Friday's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade
remained white-hot.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan refused to speak with US Secretary
of State Madeleine K. Albright. President Jiang Zemin called the
bombing a provocation to 1.2 billion Chinese people. The leading
government-controlled newspaper, People's Daily, dismissed as a lie
the US claim that the bombing, which killed three people and
injured 20, was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Chernomyrdin, Russia's special envoy on the Kosovo
crisis, said after meeting with Jiang in Beijing that despite NATO
rejection of Russian and Chinese demands that the bombing stop,
work should continue on a plan worked out by Russia and the seven
richest industrial nations last week to get Yugoslavian forces out
of Kosovo and deploy international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   NATO says it launched the bombing campaign, entering its 50th
day Wednesday, to stop Yugoslavian forces, which are dominated by
the Serbian ethnic group, from abusing ethnic Albanians who make up
90 percent of the population in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. More
than 700,000 people have fled Kosovo, often in the face of armed
threats from Serbs, since the campaign began.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin met with Jiang in an attempt to keep China from
blocking UN Security Council approval of the peacekeeping scheme.
He then returned to Moscow, where he is to meet Wednesday with US
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. The Russian envoy said he
had new proposals to discuss with Talbott but provided no
specifics.
</P>
<P>
   US State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the bombing of
the Chinese Embassy would not have ``any effect whatsoever on the
pace of diplomacy or the military campaign'' because China would
not block a proposal that would end the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   In other major Kosovo news Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   -- NATO and US officials said there are no indications that the
withdrawal of forces announced by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic on Sunday actually is occurring, and added there is clear
evidence that fighting between the Kosovo Liberation Army and
Yugoslavian forces continues. Yugoslavia had said it was beginning
a partial withdrawal because the KLA was defeated and dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   -- NATO launched some of its heaviest air raids to date,
striking airfields, petroleum storage and production facilities,
tanks, artillery, and military command posts throughout Serbia in
attacks described as ``very successful'' by German Major General
Walter Jertz, who gave the alliance's daily military report. NATO
also said it would begin flying missions against Yugoslavia from
Hungary and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   -- The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said it was
running out of funds to deal with the crisis and warned that
tensions were rising in Macedonia, where refugee camps are
overcrowded and and the ethnically Slavic, Christian majority is
uncomfortable with the influx of more than 200,000 ethnic
Albanians, who are Muslim. But Macedonian Foreign Minister
Aleksandar Dimitrov said some of the problems could be attributed
to excessive bureaucracy and insensitivity on the part of the UN
agency.
</P>
<P>
   -- China, which already had suspended a variety of military,
arms control and human rights contacts with the United States,
canceled a planned visit next week by Gen. Charles Krulak,
commandant of the Marine Corps. Pentagon officials said it also
appeared unlikely that Defense Secretary William S. Cohen would be
able to visit China as planned in June.
</P>
<P>
   -- Legal representatives of the 19 NATO countries participating
in the bombing, appearing before the International Court of Justice
in The Hague, concluded their defense against charges made to the
court by Yugoslavia that NATO was committing genocide in the
Balkans. The NATO representatives said the campaign is a legally
justified intervention aimed at ending a humanitarian catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   China is making four demands related to the bombing of its
embassy _ an open and official apology to the government and people
of China, a thorough investigation, public disclosure of the
results, and severe punishment of those responsible.
</P>
<P>
   US officials stressed that President Clinton, Albright, and
other NATO leaders have apologized and expressed regret repeatedly,
but only Tuesday were these apologies conveyed to the Chinese
public by the government-controlled media _ implying that
withholding the apologies whipped up the protesters who stoned and
assaulted the US Embassy in Beijing over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, from the State Department, said the bombing is being
thoroughly investigated ``to see how this mistake could have
occurred and to ensure that it does not happen again.'' He said the
investigation is in a preliminary stage, and that the US ``will
consider appropriate action'' when it is completed. He made no
commitment either to reveal the full results of the investigation
or to punish those responsible for the error.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu dismissed explanations that the
bombing resulted from misinformation by CIA target planners.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could the joint intelligence source of the most powerful
military alliance in the world mistakenly identify the location of
a large diplomatic mission with a big courtyard, a plate on the
front door and flying the national flag?'' Zhu said to reporters at
a briefing.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the sniping between the UN refugee agency and the
Macedonian government, there were other ominous signs Tuesday from
that former Yugoslav republic, whose stability is vital to
containing the fighting in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   UN personnel said trains loaded with refugees were arriving at
Blace, on the Macedonia-Kosovo border, letting a few hundred people
off and returning into Kosovo still almost full. It appeared the
Serbs would be able to unleash a new flood of refugees on the
over-stressed Macedonian camps and government virtually on a
moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to relieve the pressure on Macedonia by transferring
some of the refugees to neighboring Albania are faltering, the UN
said, because refugees are resisting relocation out of fear they
will not be able to leave from Albania for Europe or North America.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees being evacuated from the region have come largely from
Macedonia to relieve ethnic and political tension there. Relief
agencies had planned to move 6,000 refugees from Macedonia between
last Thursday and Sunday but could find only 650 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest day of evacuations yet, 2,242 refugees left
Macedonia Monday, most to the United States, Canada, Turkey, or
Ireland. About 38,400 people have been evacuated from the region so
far.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ She was the prelude to Hillary Rodham Clinton, a
quietly rebellious first lady of the late 1970s who sat in on
Cabinet meetings, pushed Congress to pass mental health legislation
_ and was asked by her party to run for U.S. senator from Georgia
after her husband left the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even consider it,'' Rosalynn Carter said last week in
a 39th-floor suite of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, where she was
ensconced with her Secret Service agents during a visit to New
York. ``What would I have done in Washington with Jimmy at home?''
</P>
<P>
   Home was Plains, Ga., population 700 or so. But what about
taking the defeated president to Washington as a Senate spouse?
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter smiled at the thought: ``I think the question
answers itself.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Carter said she hadn't had a real
conversation with her since 1992. ``I've seen her at maybe two
events,'' Mrs. Carter said, squirming. ``This is embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's office said Tuesday that one event was former
President Nixon's funeral and another was a 1997 Habitat for
Humanity house-building in Kentucky, where Mrs. Clinton and Mrs.
Carter installed vinyl siding.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter did manage to say that she has ``a lot of respect''
for Mrs. Clinton, although she did not exactly endorse the first
lady's potential Senate campaign from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's up to her, if she wants to do it,'' Mrs. Carter
said. ``She's so well educated, and so capable. I think she
probably would really like to continue to use her knowledge and
influence. I can understand why she wants to run for the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The club of living former First Ladies has a membership of five:
Mrs. Carter, Betty Ford, Barbara Bush, Nancy Reagan and Lady Bird
Johnson. As a wife of a former Southern governor and a close
political partner of her husband, Mrs. Carter is by far the most
like Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been bad blood between the Clintons and Carters
for nearly two decades, ever since Jimmy Carter sent several
hundred Cuban refugees from the Mariel boatlift to Arkansas,
creating a political crisis for then Gov. Bill Clinton, who in part
blamed Carter for his gubernatorial re-election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Carter said he felt ignored by the Clinton White
House, while the Clintons complained that the former president was
meddling in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Rosalynn Carter, the political wife who
has always kept the names and carried the slights. ``When they
first went to Washington, he was a Southern governor,'' she said of
Clinton. ``And Jimmy had not been re-elected. And I think they
wanted to detach themselves a little from that. And I can
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter was in town to receive an award and to promote a
paperback edition of ``Helping Someone With Mental Illness,'' her
book on mental health. She is 71, fit, shy and self-contained,
although she warmed up toward the end of an hourlong talk.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Mrs. Clinton, who is 20 years younger, Mrs. Carter never
seemed frustrated as the political spouse, although she has a
clear-eyed view of what people demand of the president's wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to hurt the president, they can jump on the first
lady,'' Mrs. Carter said. ``But what happened to Hillary is really
interesting to me. Because when she was working on policy she was
criticized. But as soon as she stood by her man, everyone loved
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Clinton, Mrs. Carter lobbied to pass legislation, in
her case the Mental Health Systems Act of 1980, although the
financing died under President Reagan. But unlike Mrs. Clinton, who
testified before Congress and then failed in her efforts for health
care reform, Mrs. Carter worked with less fireworks. ``They
probably would have treated me the same way if I'd gone to Congress
and said, `This is my bill and I want you to pass this,''' Mrs.
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mrs. Carter did testify about the mental health
legislation before a Senate committee, as she recounts in ``First
Lady From Plains,'' her autobiography. ``We could find a record of
only one other first lady who had testified before Congress _
Eleanor Roosevelt on behalf of the coal miners,'' Mrs. Carter
proudly wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter said she spends a third of her time traveling, a
third at the Carter Center in Atlanta and a third at home in
Plains. ``It's a great life,'' she said. ``What you learn when you
get out of the White House is that you still have the resources.''
Of course, ``if a first lady goes anywhere, she gets a lot more
attention than a former first lady does. But a former first lady
gets enough.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her good friends these days is Betty Ford. The husbands,
antagonists after the 1976 presidential election, have long since
patched things up.) Mrs. Carter and Mrs. Ford have taken a trip to
Washington together, where they stayed at the Hay-Adams Hotel and
lobbied Congress on Mrs. Clinton's health care bill _ Mrs. Carter
to ensure that it covered mental health, Mrs. Ford to see that it
included substance abuse. ``It didn't have what any of us wanted,''
she said. Mrs. Ford ``got together the Republicans, and I got
together the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carter said she has long got over her bitterness from her
husband's loss to Ronald Reagan. Even so, ``my biggest regret in
life was that Jimmy was defeated.''

U.S. REJECTS CALL TO STOP YUGOSLAV ATTACK 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ China and Russia called on NATO Tuesday to halt its
air campaign against Yugoslavia in the wake of the mistaken bombing
of the Chinese Embassy, but the United States rejected the demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to continue with prosecuting the air campaign
until the NATO conditions are met, and that alone will be the cause
of any suspension of the bombing,'' said White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, Chinese President Jiang Zemin met with Russian envoy
Viktor Chernomyrdin and they agreed that the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization must stop its attacks against Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's forces before peace talks begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main principle is to stop the bombing,'' Chernomyrdin
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chernomyrdin also urged the Chinese not to block a U.N.
Security Council resolution that Russia and the seven world
economic powers crafted last week that would demand Milosevic
remove his troops and allow an international security force into
Kosovo to protect the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang, in his first comments about the embassy bombing, called
it a ``provocation'' against the people of China. Jiang has not
responded to a letter sent by President Clinton on Sunday that
apologized and offered to discuss the incident by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has demonstrated the enthusiasm, will and power of the
great patriotism of the Chinese people,'' the media reported Jiang
as telling Chernomyrdin. ``The whole country is now determined to
study and work harder, so as to develop the national economy
continuously, enhance national strength, and fight back with
concrete deeds against the barbaric act of U.S.-led NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese media reported for the first time about the apology made
by President Clinton and NATO. The protests that have made
Ambassador James Sasser a hostage in the embassy appeared to ebb.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview with NBC-TV's ``Today'' show, Sasser
said there were only a few hundred protesters compared to 10,000
Sunday. ``We're not getting nearly as many rocks thrown at us, and
the crowds are much smaller,'' Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police escorted only small numbers of protesters to the
embassy and prevented them from carrying rocks. Sasser said the
front of the embassy looks ``like a war zone'' after three days of
peltings by rocks. Sasser also said he and staff members so feared
the embassy would be overrun Sunday that they began destroying
sensitive information and disabling machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The roiling of Sino-American relations began Friday when a B-2
Stealth bomber attacked the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade based on
faulty information. The Central Intelligence Agency conceded using
an old map of Belgrade that did not include the location of the
Chinese Embassy, which moved to a newer facility in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen, appearing before a Senate
appropriations subcommittee, said the Chinese government inflamed
passions by suggesting the embassy bombing was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between righteous indignation and
calculated exploitation,'' Cohen said of China's actions. Cohen
again explained the bombing resulted from an ``intelligence
failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also disputed Belgrade's claim that some Yugoslavian
troops are being withdrawn after completing their mission to rid
Kosovo of rebels. Troops stormed into the Serbian province in March
and uprooted nearly 1.3 million of the 1.7 million ethnic Albanians
that make up the majority. More than 700,000 have fled to Albanian
and Macedonian refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one, we have seen no evidence of any partial pullout,
and number two, a partial pullout would mean a total victory for
him,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense chief repeated NATO demands that Milosevic withdraw
all his forces. NATO wants Yugoslavia to allow the return of the
Kosovar refugees and allow an international security force into the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen appeared before the Senate panel as Congress prepares to
vote on Clinton's request for $6 billion to fund the United States'
cost of the NATO operation.
</P>
<P>
   The House nearly doubled the president's request as it offered
the Pentagon more money while the Senate also had added a series of
pork-barrel projects. Clinton has threatened to veto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   NATO operations have intensified in recent days as warplanes
aimed at nearly two dozen targets in Serbia and Kosovo. NATO also
reported Yugoslavian forces appeared to be continuing firefights
with Kosovar rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that there is no pause in NATO's operation Allied
Force, which now enters its 49th day,'' said NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Shea also said he hoped China would ``work constructively with
Russia'' to pass a U.N. resolution calling on Milosevic to accept
the conditions reached by NATO, Russia and seven world economic
powers.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
made her fourth direct appeal to Serbs, the ethnic majority in the
Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this conflict is over, good and decent Serbs will be
appalled at what has been done in your name,'' Albright said. She
also dismissed the comments of one Yugoslavian government official
who said the ethnic Albanians were paid actors in a NATO-directed
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see a democratic Serbia enter modern Europe and
join the community of Euro-Atlantic democracies. That is where you
truly belong. But first, you must put the ugly specter of `ethnic
cleansing,' this dark chapter from Europe's past, behind you once
and for all,'' she said.

SENATE DEBATES JUVENILE CRIME BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LOUISE D. PALMER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHNGTON _ The Senate took up a $1 billion juvenile crime bill
Tuesday, three weeks after the Littleton, Colo., shooting tragedy,
giving both parties new ammunition for old positions on how to cope
with violent crime.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional opening day of debate, Republicans were
galvanized to crack down on youth crime with tougher laws, while
Democrats pushed for more crime prevention programs and stricter
gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two parties appear to have reached a compromise on
some key provisions, the battlelines were drawn immediately, with
the Democratic leadership unveiling three amendments to the
tough-on-crime Republican bill as soon as debate began.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill, which has languished in different forms in
the Senate for two years, would give prosecutors rather than judges
the power to try children as young as 14 years of age in adult
courts. It also would enhance penalties for a variety of violent
offenses and target gang-related crime in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are few issues that will come before the Senate this
Congress that touch the lives of more of our fellow Americans than
our national response to juvenile crime,'' said Senator Orrin G.
Hatch, the Utah Republican and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.
``Crime and delinquency among our young people is a problem that
troubles us in our neighborhoods, schools and parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and his Democratic counterpart, Senator Joseph Biden of
Delaware, hammered out a compromise Tuesday that would set aside
roughly $513 million in federal funds for drug treatment, school
counseling and crime prevention programs.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise also would provide $50 million to hire
prosecutors to target juvenile offenders and bring them into
federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   But agreement appeared to end there.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are emphasizing measures that would require the
entertainment industry to take responsibility for marketing violent
images to children and to encourage the government to enforce laws
already on the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing a law sounds good, but to really maximize our impact
... we've got to prosecute the laws we've got,'' said Senator Jeff
Sessions, Republican of Alabama. He said there has been a dramatic
drop in the number of juveniles prosecuted in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are pushing crime prevention and treatment strategies,
and some lawmakers want to add to the bill the most significant
gun-control legislation since the 1993 Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire nation will be watching the Senate this week,''
said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York. ``They will
be watching to see if we have the will to stand with the American
people, or if we will buckle to the few remaining extremists in the
gun lobby who want gridlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have agreed to include in the bill a ``juvenile
Brady'' provision that would forbid juveniles with a felony record
from ever buying a gun, and they might go along with changes in the
way gun shows are regulated.
</P>
<P>
   But few have said they will support Democratic proposals to
reimpose a three-day waiting period on buying a handgun, to require
background checks and a paper trail on gun-show purchases, or to
mandate that guns be sold with trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control forces, however, might get a boost in the wake of
the Colorado shootings, according to Republican aides. How
Republicans will respond to Democratic amendments proposed by the
minority leadership, including one crafted by Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, is also unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's initiative is modeled on Boston's successful effort to
link parents, schools, mental health and law enforcement resources
in the fight to prevent and respond to youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, the Senate chambers echoed with dramatic
calls by members to uncover the roots of youth violence.
</P>
<P>
   Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, and John
McCain, Republican of Arizona, proposed establishing a national
commission on youth violence to formalize the process of exploring
the problem and a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most basic and profound responsibility that our culture _
any culture _ has is raising its children,'' said McCain. ``We are
failing that responsibility and the extent of our failure is being
measured in the deaths and injuries of kids in the schoolyard.''

ARMEY PROPOSES JULY DEBATE ON CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a new sign of flexibility by the Republican
leadership, the House majority leader said Tuesday that he thought
the House should consider legislation by the end of July to
overhaul campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the minority leader, has steadily
opposed the bipartisan legislation to ban the unlimited,
unregulated donations to political parties known as soft money.
House leaders have talked about a debate by the end of September,
but Armey said Tuesday that he thought the House should get the
debate over with. Last year the bill passed the House handily
despite the opposition of the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is that we should move it by the end of July,''
Armey said at his weekly news conference. ``I think a lot of
activists will be more comfortable with that. It will just be a
more pleasant experience to take it up. We have a lot of good
people with a lot of good ideas. Give them a fair shot on the floor
and walk though it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Armey was signaling a change of heart
by Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., as well. Hastert has said he
will schedule the debate by the end of September. But he also told
several dozen Republican moderates last week that he would consider
their plea for an earlier vote.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Davis, a spokeswoman for Armey, said the majority leader
was simply stating his longstanding position. Senior Republicans
said Hastert could be leaning Armey's way.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Calif., the chief sponsor of the main
bipartisan bill to restrict soft money and some forms of issue
advertising, said Tuesday: ``July is certainly better than saying
we will deal with it in September. But now is better than July. I
think we should do it now and get it over with.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a July date for the debate could pose a tactical
quandary for the bipartisan coalition working to pass the
legislation, whose Democratic sponsor is Rep. Martin T. Meehan of
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been fighting for a vote before Memorial Day or
before the July 4 congressional recess to put pressure on the
Senate, where the bill died last year in a filibuster. And 192
Democrats have signed a special discharge petition in an effort to
go around the Republican leadership and force the measure to the
House floor for a vote. They need 218 signers to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are reluctant to challenge Hastert, and many of
those who support an overhaul of the campaign finance laws would be
unlikely to sign the petition if their speaker were willing to meet
them halfway and hold a vote in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own preference, I say this very definitely, would be to do
this before the July 4 recess,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J.
``But there are a whole number of people who thought that before
the August recess would be satisfactory.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Democrats said that a vote by the end of July would still
leave the Senate dealing with the issue after its August recess,
when Congress is usually consumed with trying to pass spending
bills before the Oct. 1 start of the new federal fiscal year.
Meehan said this would make it harder for Senate sponsors of the
bill to use every tactic at their disposal to pass campaign finance
legislation, because they would not want to risk a government
shutdown by holding up spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armey's announcement today that late July would be a
reasonable time seems like just another attempt to kill meaningful
reform by delay,'' Meehan said. ``Reformers in the Senate know that
if they receive the House reform bill any later than the beginning
of July, they won't have enough time to navigate the Senate bill to
legislative success.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans oppose the Shays-Meehan measure, in part
because their party raises more money than the Democratic Party and
in part because they say the measure imposes unconstitutional
limits on free speech. Besides banning soft money, it would limit
the ability of outside advocacy groups to run thinly disguised
campaign advertisements in the period before elections.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has led the Senate fight
against the bill, says he will do so again, vowing to kill it one
more time. He recently compared the bill to a character played by
Glenn Close, taking one last stab at the man she was stalking in
the movie ``Fatal Attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue springs back,'' McConnell said. ``You think you've
killed it and it's back again.''

`TRIPPIN' A NASTY, DULL, PREDICTABLE TAKE ON THE SAME OLD THEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Seattle) _ There's an old Marvin Gaye song that asks, ``How
long can this keep goin' on?'' Hopefully, not very much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trippin''' is another in a line of recent movies that are dull
variations on the theme of high school boy/girl wants girl/boy,
gets boy/girl through subversive method, then loses girl/boy and
ends up making up with boy/girl at the senior prom. They're an
insult to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The groove worn by movies like ``Can't Hardly Wait'' and ``10
Things I Hate About You'' is woefully thin. How long can it be
before kids get tired of such sexist and denigrating fare?
</P>
<P>
   ``Trippin''' which is about yet another trio of high school boys
who fool girls into sleeping with them by promising them a prom
date, is on the lowest rung of the ladder yet.
</P>
<P>
   The teenagers in Gary Hardwick's script are typical high school
kids concerned with the usual woes: Where do I go to college and
how can I get a date for the prom?
</P>
<P>
   For Greg Reed (Deon Richmond), college is a non-event and the
girl of his dreams is unattainable. He retreats into his fantasy
life _ trippin', his friends and family call it. There he's a rock
star, a computer whiz, a lover beyond compare _ in short,
everything the real Greg is not.
</P>
<P>
   Greg has a huge crush on Cinny Hawkins (Maia Campbell), the best
looking and smartest girl in school. She's sure to be prom queen
but her cling-on boyfriend hardly lets Greg get close. But Cinny is
no snob. She befriends Greg and believes him when he lies to her
and tells her he's been accepted at UCLA. She thinks he has a
future. Only Greg, his two loser best friends and forgiving family
know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   So when Cinny breaks up with her beau and accepts Greg's offer
to go to the prom, how long can the charade go on before Cinny
realizes Greg is just another confused flake who doesn't know who
he is or what he wants?
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers have the same problem. After making Greg out to
be a sincere guy, they slather the closing credits with sexist,
crude remarks about Greg's ``scoring'' with Cinny. It's a cheap
shot designed to titillate the lowest of the low.
</P>
<P>
   The script holds no surprises. It's a nasty, dull, predictable
take on the same old theme. It doesn't matter if the cast is black,
white, gay or straight, Hollywood is stuck in a rut. Hopefully, the
tired old story will soon wear itself out at the box office and the
studios will be forced to re-examine what teenagers are _ as well
as what they want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Trippin'. Directed by David Raynr. Written by Gary Hardwick.
Cast: Deon Richmond, Maia Campbell, Donald Adeosun Faison, Guy
Torry. Rogue Pictures. 92 minutes. Rated R for sexual content,
language.

 &HT;    Chung offers own story to House committee
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Democratic fund-raiser Johnny Chung finally
got the chance Tuesday to give his side of the story, telling a
congressional panel that he received $300,000 from a high-ranking
Chinese official and was offered more to keep quiet about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Chung told members of the House Government Reform and
Oversight Committee that the $300,000 wire transfer from the head
of China's military intelligence agency was a ``business
investment,'' not an attempt by the Chinese to influence American
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is my opinion that much of what these people wanted from me
had less to do with influencing any election as it was to gain what
most Americans want from our system _influence and the ability to
develop relationships with important people,'' Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   Chung, an immigrant who worked his way from being a busboy at a
Holiday Inn to a successful blast fax business owner, viewed
campaign donations as his ticket to the upper echelons of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to realize that I could also get a little something
back for giving money,'' said Chung, who once compared donations to
subway tokens in the access they bought at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1996, Chung said, he received more than $2 million
from his business contacts in China. Less than 20 percent went to
political campaigns, Chung said, none of it directly.
</P>
<P>
   Chung testified that he often took Chinese businessmen and
officials to political events, paying their way since it is illegal
for foreigners to donate to a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for being a big donor, Chung said, he was allowed to
visit the White House more than 50 times. He gave $366,000 from
1994 to 1996 to the Democratic National Committee, all of which has
since been returned.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the White House impressed Chung's foreign business
contacts. Pictures with politicians are ``worth their weight in
gold'' in China, Chung said.
</P>
<P>
   Chung also made several new accusations during his five-hour
testimony claiming, among other things, that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Mark Middleton, a former senior White House aide, allegedly
accepted $500,000 from Asia Pulp and Paper in September 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Arkansas restaurateur and longtime Clinton friend
Charlie Trie asked the Chinese government for $1 million to support
President Clinton and the Democrats. Trie in 1996 offered more than
$600,000 from questionable sources to Clinton's legal defense fund,
which rejected the donations. Trie goes on trial Monday in Little
Rock, charged with obstructing a U.S. Senate investigation into
campaign fund-raising abuses by ordering the concealment of
subpoenaed documents in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   _ After pleading guilty to making illegal campaign contributions
to the Clinton campaign, Chung was threatened and offered money
from Beijing ``to take care of'' his legal expenses and family if
he refused to cooperate with the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), a member of the panel, said Chung's
testimony shows there ``was a plan by the Chinese government to
funnel money into the president's re-election efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he is equally concerned about recent reports of
alleged espionage by the Chinese government at several U.S. nuclear
weapons laboratories and by Clinton's approval, announced Tuesday,
of a commercial satellite launch next month in China for the
Iridium global paging and telephone network.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is a breakdown of any barriers between our
government and China,'' Barr said. ``This administration has
transferred highly sensitive technology that far eclipses the
Rosenberg trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats scoffed at such claims, saying Chung's testimony
shows the Democratic National Committee had no idea that he was
receiving money from China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) asked how the committee could
believe anything Chung said when he has contradicted himself
several times and made allegations that, once investigated, turned
out to be false.
</P>
<P>
   Chung became a cooperating witness in the federal campaign
fund-raising investigation after pleading guilty to making illegal
contributions to Clinton and other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Chung now has mixed feelings about the political system where he
won so much influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is your system,'' Chung told the lawmakers. ``I didn't
create it. If you guys don't like it, change it. Don't shout at me,
change it.''

 Column: Scheid Vineyards Wants to Pour Some Life Into
Annual  Meetings 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Mark Veverka &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Annual shareholder meetings suck.
</P>
<P>
   OK, there, I said it. Please excuse the graphic descriptor. But
after struggling to find a less abrasive adjective, I can think of
no other word that adequately expresses the unrelenting disdain I
hold for these horrendously rote rituals of corporate boredom.
</P>
<P>
   I strongly believe that I've earned the right to feel this way.
After nearly 15 years of covering public companies, I've easily
been to more than a hundred of these dreaded excuses for democratic
discourse.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at Crain's Chicago Business, where I once was an
eager-to-please intern and later a jaded reporter, the
award-winning business weekly made it a practice to cover the
annual meetings of every public company in the greater Chicago
metropolitan area. The thinking was, a fight could always break
out, or at least it was assured that almost every public company
would grace the publication's pages at least once a year.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, while spring is a celebrated event for most
Chicagoans _ offering a welcome respite from yet another brutal
Midwestern winter _ it means weeks upon weeks of gosh-awful annual
meetings for the staffers at CCB.
</P>
<P>
   I drag out my annual meeting baggage to raise a point, however.
One publicly held company actually is attempting to change our
perception of these moribund affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Scheid Vineyards of Marina del Rey (Los Angeles County) is
daring to make its annual meeting this afternoon in San Francisco
easier to swallow _ so to speak. In this, Scheid's second year as a
public company, the grape grower is turning its annual meeting into
a big ol' wine tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. Contending that Wall Street may not yet fully
understand its industry, Scheid is using its shareholder meeting as
a platform for a wine industry symposium.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of holding a routine meeting at Scheid's corporate
headquarters in Southern California, the company opted to invite
some of the wine industry's top economists and financial experts,
hoping to demystify investing in publicly held vineyards, says
Chief Financial Officer Heidi Scheid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our effort to educate the investment community. We're
trying to attract several groups (including) financial analysts,
money managers and individual investors,'' Scheid says.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the company chose to move its meeting from Los
Angeles to San Francisco's Ferry Building, bringing its story
closer to California's investing and wine-making centers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Scheid isn't the first wine company to pour a glass
of wine at an annual meeting. Other publicly held vintners do that.
In fact, some vineyards, such as Chalone, throw elaborate
wine-tasting dinners for its shareholders. But because Scheid is
less a winemaker, per say (it makes only 5,000 cases of its
high-end wine a year), and more a producer of wine grapes, the
company aims to use the forum of its annual meeting to explain its
specialized niche in the industry, Scheid says.
</P>
<P>
   Scheid grows premium varietal wine grapes on about 6,000 acres
located mostly on the Central Coast in Monterey County. While it
provides grapes to such big-scale producers as Canadaigua and
Beringer (which both are publicly held), Scheid also supplies
smaller, upscale vineyards such as Hess Collection, Chalone and
Joseph Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Scheid has some explaining to do. Its stock is
trading at about $5 a share, down about 44 percent for the past 12
months, according to Bloomberg. Scheid's grape production declined
about 30 percent in 1998 due to lousy weather, reports financial
analyst Anton J. Brenner of Cruttendon Roth, which rates this
micro-cap a ``strong buy.'' Brenner argues that the stock is cheap
given that it is trading only five times its projected earnings for
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The bullish bet is that grape prices will rebound and the
premium wine market (brands between $7 and $12 a bottle) will
continue to grow. Overall, wine consumption is relatively flat in
the United States, but those who buy wine are drinking more bottles
of the premium stuff with fatter margins, says wine economist Jon
Fredrikson of Gomberg-Fredrikson of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Boomers with some extra money in their pocket are going
crazy for these wines,'' Fredrikson says. ``That's where the action
is.''
</P>
<P>
   No ... the action very well could be, dare I say, at the Scheid
shareholders meeting.

DISMISSING WORD OF TROOP WITHDRAWAL, NATO CONTINUES BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-CHINA, KOSOVO-CONGRESS) 
(rm) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS with MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Undeterred by calls from China and Russia to halt
the bombing, American and allied forces pounded targets across
Yugoslavia on Tuesday as NATO leaders vowed to continue the air war
until President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to meet all of their
demands.
</P>
<P>
   After relatively quiet nights of bombing following the strike on
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade late Friday night, NATO aircraft
hit 37 targets overnight on Monday and, with clearing skies,
pressed their attack virtually without pause through the day and
night Tuesday, American and NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffing Yugoslavia's announcement that it had begun
withdrawing Army and police units from Kosovo, NATO warned that it
would continue attacking those forces, even those that might be
retreating, until Milosevic agreed to remove all of his troops and
allow hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees to return to their
homes under the protection of an international force.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Brussels and here in Washington said there was no
evidence that any Yugoslav forces had left the province, dismissing
the announcement as a ploy by Milosevic to capitalize on the
international outrage over the bombing of China's embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one, we have seen no evidence of any partial pullout,''
Secretary of Defense William Cohen told members of the Senate's
Appropriations Committee Tuesday. ``Number two, a partial pullout
would mean a total victory for him. A partial pullout is not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic efforts to end the NATO bombardment remained mired in
the political fallout from NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy.
Russia's special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who had been trying to
play peacemaker before the embassy attack, met with China's top
leaders in Beijing Tuesday and offered no real sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   China repeated its insistence that NATO stop the bombing before
any negotiations for a peace settlement could begin. While
Chernomyrdin said he still supported peace proposals reached last
week in Germany that linked a bombing pause to verifiable evidence
of Serbian troop withdrawal, he also called for a halt to the NATO
bombing while in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   After the embassy bombing, China suspended its cooperation with
the United States on several fronts, including its military
contacts, which the Clinton administration has tried to cultivate.
The Pentagon announced Tuesday that China had suspended a visit by
the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Charles Krulak, and a trip
by Cohen, now scheduled for June, appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Tuesday that the Chinese government was taking
advantage of a mistake that the United States and NATO had
acknowledged. He cited the fact that Chinese media only today
reported President Clinton's apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between righteous indignation and
calculated exploitation,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven weeks into NATO's air war, Yugoslavia's government
announced on Monday that it had begun to withdraw some of its
troops, saying they were no longer needed because it had defeated
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials did not say how many of its approximately
40,000 troops in or near Kosovo would be leaving, but some
suggested the withdrawal could occur more quickly if NATO refrained
from bombing the retreating columns on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav officials also said that they were ultimately
prepared to shrink their force in Kosovo to the ``peacetime'' level
it was at before NATO's bombing raids began, if a settlement was
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NATO and at the Pentagon derided the announcement,
saying that it would leave Yugoslavia with a force of almost 30,000
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something which allows 10,000 troops to go home while the
other 30,000 get on with business as usual in Kosovo is not
something that we are prepared to aid and abet in any way,'' NATO's
spokesman, Jamie Shea, said Tuesday. ``President Milosevic has to
take all of his forces out.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officials here in Washington said Tuesday that intelligence
reports indicated Serbian-led forces continued to mount at least
small- scale operations against ethnic Albanian rebel fighters and
civilians. Over the weekend, the Yugoslav forces resumed using
helicopters and flying at least some of their aircraft, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces have dispersed and dug into defensive positions,
particularly along the rugged valley that runs north from
Macedonia, evidently in preparation for the possibility of a NATO
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Yugoslavia takes seriously reports that NATO's
planners might someday consider an invasion from Hungary, too, the
Army has reportedly begun reinforcing positions along a defensive
line north of Novi Sad, in the province of Vojvodina, one senior
defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's campaign entered its 49th day, there was no easing of
the bombing. Throughout the day American and allied aircraft _
including American B-1's, B-2s, B-52s, F-117 ``stealth'' attack
jets and the whole array of fighters _ criss-crossed the skies over
Yugoslavia. They struck radio and television towers, oil storage
tanks, bridges and an Army barracks in Cacak, officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's strikes followed an intensive night which included at
least one strike in Belgrade, an army barracks at Mount Avala, the
officials said. It was the first strike in the capital since the
bombing of the embassy, but officials strongly denied that there
had been any change in the attack plans because of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, explosions again rocked the edges of Belgrade,
and new strikes were reported in Pancevo, the industrial city whose
oil facilities have been been repeatedly struck by NATO warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest strikes, officials reported having success against
tanks, artillery and other armored forces in Kosovo, though they
acknowledged that taking out those forces was difficult and
painstakingly slow, especially since many are now well hidden,
taking advantage of natural features like forests and caves, as
well as man-made tunnels and bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   After seven weeks of bombardment, officials here say the forces
in Kosovo are clearly suffering, especially from the shortage of
fuel, which has been reduced to a relative trickle. One official
said the forces ``are in fuel extremis.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are few signs they are ready to break. ``They're
dispersing themselves very well,'' a senior defense official said.
``They have prepared defensive measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Yugoslavia's claims to have vanquished Kosovo's rebels,
Pentagon and NATO officials said that Yugoslav troops have been
pressing their attacks against rebel strongholds in the region.
They said there was fighting in the north, particularly along the
roads from Pristina to Podujevo and Mitrovica. There have also been
skirmishes in central Kosovo and near the Albanian border. NATO
officials said that the Kosovo Liberation Army was very active
inside Kosovo but was suffering heavy casualties. A Kosovo
Liberation Army representative in Kukes, Albania, near the Kosovo
border, said today that the rebel army command in Kosovo had seen
``absolutely no evidence of a withdrawal'' of Yugoslav forces.

PROPOSED FOREIGN DEBT SWAP GETS MIXED REVIEWS IN BRAZIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil is proceeding with a plan to swap
debt issued abroad by dozens of the country's largest private
companies for safer securities partly backed by the government,
despite widespread criticism of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, engineered for the government by Goldman, Sachs, would
allow holders of foreign-currency-denominated debt sold by 92
Brazilian companies to exchange these securities for billions of
dollars in new bonds. These would be issued by an offshore company
supported by Brazil's national development bank.
</P>
<P>
   The plan's proponents say it alleviates concern over the
possibility of default by some companies that are short of cash,
and in doing so, strengthens Brazil's credibility among foreign
investors. ``We're cleaning up imperfections in the market by
providing more liquidity,'' said Jose Luiz Osorio, superintendent
of investment banking at the Rio de Janeiro-based national
development bank. Osorio said the plan should ease the re-entry of
a wider range of Brazilian companies into global debt markets after
a drought in financing for emerging markets the last two years.
There has been only a trickle of recent Brazilian corporate bond
issues sold abroad as the nation recovers from a financial crisis
set in motion by currency devaluation in January and Russian
default the summer before.
</P>
<P>
   If the swap succeeds, it could work as a model for other nations
faced with a decrease in short-term financing after a crisis of
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, Mexico and Brazil have grappled with such a
problem. By performing a ``bail-in'' of private business, fears of
a cascade of defaults by borrowers would presumably be lessened.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the plan _ a widely varied group that includes
powerful corporations and outspoken leftist politicians _ have
emerged. They include the Globo media group, which runs Brazil's
dominant television network; Votorantim, an industrial
conglomerate, and Gerdau, a multinational steelmaker. These
companies have shown reluctance to take part in the plan, saying
their creditworthiness could be affected if investors perceive the
chance of default. The currency devaluation has made it costlier
for companies to service debt denominated in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Political opponents of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
government have questioned the transaction because in their view it
uses a public institution to protect big private borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Private risk is being nationalized with the people footing the
bill,'' said Guido Mantega, a top economist with the Workers Party.
If the government is willing to shield dollar-indebted companies
from default, then it should protect smaller ones that have not had
access to foreign markets, Mantega said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Union of So Paulo, an estimated
700,000 businesses carry $78 billion of domestic debt, a figure
that has ballooned in recent years because of high interest rates.
That compares with $19.6 billion in foreign bonds, issued by 92
companies, that are eligible for the swap under the Goldman, Sachs
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Osorio of the national development bank said the debt swap
should free his institution to lend to smaller companies if some of
their larger counterparts are relieved of concerns about redeeming
their debt with foreign creditors. ``Fewer of the big, distressed
companies will come knocking on our door,'' he said, adding, ``Of
course, we'd like to lend in the most democratic way, but our
budget is limited.'' The development bank is already the largest
source of financing to Brazilian companies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's improving economic outlook could determine whether the
debt swap will succeed. Buoyed by optimism, some companies like
Globo are already succeeding in renewing credit that just three
months ago, with the country in economic panic, seemed impossible
to obtain. If more companies are able to refinance their debts, it
would be less likely that many investors would seek the protection
provided by the swap.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the new securities must be expressed by holders of
at least $1 billion worth by May 24, the closing date of the deal,
for the development bank to decide whether to continue.

EXECUTIVE IN BIG GOLD SCANDAL FACES INSIDER TRADING CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The vice-chairman of Bre-X Minerals Ltd. was charged
with insider trading and other securities law violations Tuesday in
connection with the company's fraudulent reports of a huge
Indonesian gold discovery three years ago, one of the biggest
financial scandals in Canada's history.
</P>
<P>
   The eight counts filed by the Ontario Securities Commission
against John Felderhof mark the first serious charges in the
scandal, which erased billions of dollars in shareholder value from
the company overnight when the gold discovery was found to be a
fake.
</P>
<P>
   Felderhof, who is also under investigation by the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, could face two years in prison and millions of
dollars of fines and restitution if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered a central figure in the scandal, Felderhof moved
to the Cayman Islands when suspicions about the legitimacy of gold
discovery at the Busang site in Indonesia came to light in 1996. It
is widely believed that he still resides in the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Felderhof has been named a defendant in several class-action
lawsuits filed on behalf of investors who saw their shares, which
once traded at more than $200, plunge to pennies. He has said he
knew nothing about the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The Ontario commission, Canada's chief market regulator, said in
a complaint filed with the Ontario Court of Justice that from April
24, 1996, to Sept. 10, 1996, Felderhof sold more than 2.7 million
shares of Bre-X for almost $84 million (Canadian), or about $58
million (U.S.) at current exchange rates, ``with knowledge of a
material fact pertaining to rights of Bre-X in relation to the
Busang properties that had not been generally disclosed.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also said that between June 20, 1996, and Feb. 17,
1997, Felderhof authorized or permitted news releases by Bre-X that
contained misleading or untrue estimates of gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Groia, Felderhof's lawyer in Toronto, said the complaint
``came as a great surprise to us.'' Felderhof or his lawyer was
ordered to appear June 15.
</P>
<P>
   Bre-X, once a penny stock based in Calgary, Alberta, became one
of the greatest stock market sensations ever in Canada's mining
industry, historically known for speculative claims of riches.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bre-X's managers had no mining experience and the
company had no revenue or profit, the company's shares soared as it
promoted the Busang site as the biggest gold discovery in history,
containing more than 70 million ounces. Placed among listings in
the Toronto Stock Exchange's elite 300 index, its market
capitalization grew to more than $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company collapsed in bankruptcy, and its shares were
delisted in 1997 when an investigation found that the Indonesian
property was a fraud, fabricated by a Bre-X geologist, Michael de
Guzman. He later died in what the authorities called a suicide by
jumping out of a helicopter over the Indonesian jungle.
</P>
<P>
   David Walsh, Bre-X's chairman and a heavy promoter of the
company's stock, died about a year ago of an aneurysm at his
Bahamas estate.

IOWA: A STRAW POLL RESERVED FOR IOWANS 
VIRGINIA: FORESHADOWING REDISTRICTING BATTLE 
MASSACHUSETTS: THAT RESIGNATION? JUST CALL IT PREMATURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In presidential politics, Iowa is best known for its
first-in-the-nation February caucuses. But earlier still, usually
in August of the preceding year, the state's Republicans gather in
Ames to talk up the coming caucuses and tease candidates and voters
a bit by conducting a presidential straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   Straw polls are, in truth, little more than straws in the wind.
Many national party leaders say they should be outlawed because
they are unscientific, subject to mischievous manipulation by
candidates and, ultimately, misleading and even harmful.
</P>
<P>
   But state party leaders _ the Democratic leaders in
Massachusetts being the latest example _ tend to schedule more of
them, not fewer, saying they build excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Front-runners see them as possible sources of embarrassment and
often try to avoid them, a tricky political move in and of itself.
Also-rans see opportunity in them.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Ames gathering often attracts as many as 10,000
participants _ including most presidential hopefuls _ it is, in the
end, a measure mainly of name recognition and the ability of
candidate organizations to haul in supporters and, if necessary,
pay their $25 entrance fees to Hilton Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, political professionals and many White House
hopefuls argue that the event's rules are so loose and its results
so often off-the-wall that there is no reason to take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, they note, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee
chartered two 727s to fly in supporters from back home. He finished
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, former Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, the
front-runner going into the gathering, chartered a fleet of buses
to haul in the faithful from all over the Midwest. He ended up in a
tie for first place with Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas _ though he
ultimately went on to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1987 poll, Pat Robertson, the religious broadcaster,
upset and embarrassed the presumed front-runner at that point, Vice
President George Bush. But Bush went on to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   This year's Iowa straw poll will be conducted in Ames on Aug.
14. But unlike polls of the past, only Iowans will be permitted to
vote _ and only after producing proof of residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make it Iowans-only so that it is a
high-quality event and means something when someone wins or someone
doesn't,'' the state's Republican chairman, Kayne Robinson, said
recently in announcing the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA FORESHADOWS REDISTRICTING BATTLE
</P>
<P>
   The focus during election year 2000 will be mainly on the
presidential race and congressional contests. But on the ballot too
will be the election of new governors and legislatures in most
states.
</P>
<P>
   These will not, however, be your usual state races. Rather, they
will take on special political import because the winners will get
to preside over the Congressional and state legislative
redistricting that will begin after the 2000 federal census.
</P>
<P>
   It is an opportunity that comes once every 10 years. A rough
rule of thumb holds that the political party that controls both the
governor's office and the legislature in a state at that point can
redraw district lines so that 1 of every 5 districts tilts in its
favor.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that in Virginia, which holds its legislative
election this year rather than next, the scramble for control is
well underway, a forerunner of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. James S. Gilmore 3rd, a Republican, will not be on the
ballot, having been elected just two years ago. But the entire
Legislature, or General Assembly, is up, with the outcome a real
cliffhanger since Republicans hold only a 21 to 19 edge over
Democrats in the state Senate, while the House of Delegates is
evenly split, with 50 Democrats on one side and 49 Republicans and
a Republican-leaning independent on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore considers the fall vote so crucial to Republican
redistricting hopes that he recently broke one of the cardinal
rules of politics. He took sides in two House primary contests.
</P>
<P>
   There was much mumbling in the party that he was more interested
in pushing conservative candidates and a conservative legislative
agenda than pushing redistricting. And one of his Republican
predecessors, A. Linwood Holton Jr., a moderate, publicly chided
the governor, accusing him of abandoning the ``politics of
inclusion'' and violating the 11th Commandment of Republicanism:
never hurt a fellow Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilmore stuck with his endorsements, saying he was only
trying to ``shape the Republican Party in a little different way''
so that it could go into the millennium in full political control
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats took heart from the divisive endorsements, with Craig
Bieber, the executive director of the state party, calling them an
``uncharacteristic lack of political judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, party officials announced that a former
Democratic congressman from Virginia, L.F. Payne, would head a
political action committee that would raise money both in and out
of the state to support Democratic efforts this year to grab
control of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   THAT RESIGNATION? JUST CALL IT PREMATURE
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Martin Meehan, D-Mass., has decided not to honor the pledge
he made back in 1995 to leave Congress in early 2001 when his
fourth term expires. Meehan says that he has concluded that the
concept of term limits has no political merit and that he can
better serve his constituents by seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Republicans have yet to put up a candidate to
oppose him. But they say they may try to force him to honor his
pledge by hauling him into court.
</P>
<P>
   On what grounds?
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Meehan made his pledge, they say, he backed it up
by sending an official letter to the House clerk that read:
``Should I be elected to serve more than two additional terms, I
hereby resign.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the Massachusetts Republican Party,
John Brockelman, vows to ``aggressively pursue'' the legal
ramifications of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan's rejoinder, though a spokesman: ``You can't resign from
a future Congress.'' &QL;

EMPOWERMENT ZONES TOUTED FOR AREAS OF PERSISTENT POVERTY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ President Clinton urged the nation's business leaders
to help spread the nation's economic growth to stubborn pockets of
poverty by investing more in poor urban neighborhoods and rural
communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we ought not leave anybody behind when we go into
the 21st century,'' the president said after touring Atlanta's
Sweet Auburn Curb Market, located in an inner-city neighborhood
revived over the past decade with public and private money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite record unemployment nationally, Clinton said, many areas
of the country remain economically stagnant, some with jobless
rates double the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that every American who's willing to work ought to
have a chance to do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 corporate executives and financiers in tow, Clinton flew
to Atlanta for a tour of the market on the eastern edge of downtown
and a discussion with local leaders and small-business owners on
ways to boost private investment in similar, economically
distressed communities.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Auburn Curb Market, located near the Martin Luther King
Jr. Historic District, opened in 1923 and went into economic
decline in the late 1980s. In 1992, Atlanta officials pumped $4.9
million into restoring the market, which now features 24 small
businesses, including flower shops, food vendors, a seafood market
and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Another $8.3 million in federal money was pumped into the market
under an Empowerment Zone program initiated by Clinton in 1994. In
addition to loan guarantees, businesses in the market receive tax
credits for creating jobs, most of which went to residents of
nearby neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the Clinton administration has designated the Lower
Rio Grande Valley and El Paso as Empowerment Zones, which qualifies
them for similar federally guaranteed loans and job training grants
for new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Houston is awaiting word on whether a 19-square-mile area including
downtown and surrounding neighborhoods will qualify for the
program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Clinton spent almost a half-hour touring Sweet
Auburn Curb Market before joining the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we try to take this example to the
whole nation,'' Clinton said after his tour. ``I want people to see
and believe it can be done in their communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Atlanta, Clinton summoned corporate leaders
to the White House to outline his program to help economically
deprived areas, which he characterized as ``new markets'' for
investors who traditionally look elsewhere to put their money,
often abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was astonished when we listened (to) some of the things that
they're already doing to bring opportunity to people,'' Clinton
said after the meeting. ``But we have to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been given an opportunity now, because we've got the
strongest economy in at least a generation, to prove that we can
bring the benefits of free enterprise to every neighborhood in
America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years our government has worked to give Americans
incentives to invest in emerging markets around the world,''
Clinton said. ``But now we know ... our greatest untapped markets
are here at home _ at the least, $85 billion in untapped markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Revisiting a proposal outlined in his State of the Union message
in January, Clinton touted his ``new markets initiative'' _ a
package of tax incentives and loan guarantees awaiting action in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals are designed to attract venture capital to areas
in need of economic stimulus, such as the Lower Rio Grande Valley,
the El Paso area and the Los Angeles barrios.
</P>
<P>
   The president announced plans for leading a delegation of CEOs
and members of Congress on a three-day tour of some of ``untapped
markets'' in the Mississippi Delta, Indian reservations and
Appalachian hamlets in early July.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going places not just to remind America of the plight of
the Americans who live there, but to highlight their enormous
economic potential,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the trip was to be patterned after trade
missions that Cabinet secretaries make overseas to help identify
markets for American investors that, through trade and commercial
agreements, lead to new jobs and economic development abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's ``new markets'' program was developed by an
administration task force working with corporate executives,
members of Congress and pioneers in community development.
</P>
<P>
   It was first unveiled in January as part of the Rev. Jesse
Jackson's Wall Street Project, a coalition of executives seeking to
expand business opportunities for minorities and women.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal before Congress includes a 25 percent tax credit
for investors in targeted communities, which administration
officials said could lead to creation of small technology firms,
shopping centers, retail stories and small manufacturing plants.

ON THE ROAD, THE RICH CORE OF `CIDER HOUSE RULES' REMAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We all know that ``you can't go home again.'' This
week, though, the question for some Seattle theater artists is
whether or not you can go ``on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than two years since both parts of ``The Cider
House Rules,'' based on John Irving's 1985 novel, premiered at the
Seattle Rep's Leo K Theatre. Since then there have been text and
cast changes, but the rich theatrical core remains.
</P>
<P>
   The current production of ``Part 1: Here in St. Cloud's,'' which
opened Thursday at Off Broadway's Atlantic Theater Co., spins a
yarn of epic proportions that never lets us forget we are both
witnesses to and participants in the action. That participation,
though, is an imaginative conjuring at the intersection of
performance and reception.
</P>
<P>
   Using a style of literary adaptation honed at Seattle's Book-It
Repertory Theatre, collaborators Tom Hulce, Jane Jones and Peter
Parnell deliver the intricate story about an abortionist who runs
an orphanage and the evolving paternal relationship with one of his
charges. Parnell's adaptation cleverly divides Irving's text among
the performers, which provides shifting perspectives on the action
as we are reminded of the storyteller's presence.
</P>
<P>
   One moment a performer is involved in the action onstage, the
next she may comment upon what is happening. These changing
perspectives can disorient audiences (and critics) accustomed to
kitchen-sink realism and ``well-made'' plays. For those willing to
go along for the ride, though, the Book-It style has certainly
pleased audiences in Seattle, Los Angeles and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Covering more than 60 years in three acts (and three-and-a-half
hours), ``Cider House'' demonstrates how a youthful indiscretion by
Dr. Larch (Colm Meaney) in the 1880s leads him to a destiny of
``doing the Lord's work'' (running an orphanage) and ``doing the
devil's work'' (performing abortions). Along the way, one of the
boys in Larch's care, Homer (Josh Hamilton), repeatedly returns to
the orphanage after bad matches with foster families until the
doctor finally accepts that this boy will remain at St. Cloud's.
</P>
<P>
   Homer becomes a kind of big brother to the other kids, reading
``David Copperfield'' to the boys and ``Jane Eyre'' to the girls.
He even learns some of the healing arts from Dr. Larch. But one of
the girls, Melony (Jillian Armenante), doesn't get all dewy-eyed
when Homer reads the stories, she has other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   As played by Armenante, who originated the role in Seattle,
Melony is a bubbling cauldron of malevolent (and sexual) intent.
Obsessed with finding her mother so she can kill her, Melony
enlists Homer's help by promising him erotic adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The liveliest scenes feature Melony and Homer romping over the
bare stage as they explore an abandoned logging camp. The
youngsters hop from chair to chair as if they were rocks in a
stream and we can practically see the water rushing past them. The
elegant simplicity of John Arnone's set design features a weathered
plank wood backdrop with several doors for quick entrances and
exits; to one side a stairway rises to another open level that
co-directors Hulce and Jones use for theatrical effect. David
Zinn's costumes still serve the production well as historical
benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   While the lively and open-hearted Michael Winters is missed as
Dr. Larch in this production, Meaney's raspy voice and distant
demeanor add a needed dimension to the doctor's relationship with
Homer. The likable, open-faced Hamilton projects a genuine
boy-next-door quality that is emotionally affecting. Meanwhile
though, it is Armenante who commands our attention onstage. And
when she's off, we eagerly await her return.
</P>
<P>
   Armenante's delicious force-of-nature performance drives much of
the action in ``Cider House,'' which is ultimately one of the
drawbacks of the production. The central relationship between Larch
and Homer evolves gently over time with only a few little bumps as
things progress. While this gentleness may be true to the
novelist's intent, it isn't particularly active or dramatic. But
when Melony is on the scene, there is always conflict, if not
utter, delirious chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, this style of theater, whether you call it
``Book-It style'' or ``chamber theater,'' is not the sort of work
for which most American actors are trained or prepared. The 1997
Seattle ``Cider House'' production is best recalled for the spell
cast by the actors as they effortlessly switched from acting in the
present to the narrator's omniscient voice and back again. There
was a magical, almost ritual essence that made us _ after a
marathon performance of both parts done on a Saturday afternoon and
evening _ wish for more.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantic Theater Co. production has yet to reach that point.
Clearly though, experience is the best teacher when it comes to
this style of work. In addition to the strong performances of the
leads, two actors from the original Seattle cast, James Chesnutt
and David Wichert, throw themselves headlong into their multiple
roles and succeed marvelously.
</P>
<P>
   While there are plans to stage the second part of ``Cider
House'' at the Atlantic, the first part remains the most expensive
show the company ever has attempted and its success will affect the
sequel's chances.
</P>
<P>
   So far, critics have been kind, some even wrote of looking
forward to the second part. The New York Times reviewer, however,
decided that the Dickensian references in ``Cider House'' and the
production's adaptive style invited comparison with the 1981
Broadway production of ``The Life and Adventures of Nicholas
Nickleby.'' In comparison, he found ``Cider House'' wanting.
</P>
<P>
   But is it live theater?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. Rough edges and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cider House'' plays at the Atlantic Theater Co., 336 W. 20th
St., through June 5. Tickets: $39-$45. Call 212-645-8015 for
information.

   NEW YORK _ Stocks were buffeted by a further selloff in the bond
market Tuesday but recovered and moved higher, led by technology
and Internet shares.
</P>

   Bond prices fell and long-term interest rates rose to their
highest level in nearly a year after an auction of new five-year
notes was poorly received. Major stock market averages dipped after
the auction results were announced in the afternoon but then
regained some of their footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a lot of concern in the bond market about an
overheated economy and what that means for inflation,'' said Ned
Riley Jr., chief investment officer at BankBoston Corp. ``But that
concern seems to be less of an issue in the stock market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.90 points, or
two-tenths of a percent, to 11,026.15. But broader market measures
did appreciably better.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressed by sharp gains in America Online, Wal-Mart and Cisco
Systems, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index gained 15.31 points,
or 1.14 percent, to 1,355.61. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ composite index
rose 40.29 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,566.68. The Russell 2000
index of smaller-company stocks increased 4.96 points, or 1.12
percent, to 446.81.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks sensitive to the business cycle, which have moved sharply
higher over the last month on signs of vigorous economic growth,
surrendered their leadership role Tuesday to the well-known, big
capitalization growth stocks that have been the market's standard
bearers for a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper, a Dow component, fell 2 1/4, to 53 7/8.
Allied Signal, another Dow stock, fell 1 3/8, to 63 9/16. And
Georgia-Pacific fell 4 3/16, to 56 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Internet stocks, which have been under selling
pressure over the last few weeks, did much better Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The group was led higher by America Online, which surged after
Mary Meeker, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's influential Internet
analyst, upgraded the company to ``strong buy'' from
``outperform.'' Later in the session, the company announced that it
would develop an Internet television service with several partners.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which was the most actively traded issue on the
New York Stock Exchange, rose 13 1/8, to 141 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, another big company with important ties to the
Internet, gained 2 5/8, to 111 7/8. After the market closed, the
company posted earnings that were slightly above expectations and
announced a 2-for-1 stock split. Riley and other analysts said the
Cisco earnings report could get technology stocks additional
momentum Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Strong earnings helped lift the price of Wal-Mart Stores, a
component of both the Dow and the S&AMP;P 500. Wal-Mart gained 2 1/8,
to 47 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise in interest rates, a number of financial
service stocks did well.

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fourteen letters by J.D. Salinger, the most private
of literary figures, are about to be auctioned in the most public
of arenas _ Sotheby's New York _ in a move likely to raise vexing
questions about the private rights of public figures.
</P>
<P>
   The letters were written between April 25, 1972, and Aug. 17,
1973, to writer Joyce Maynard, with whom Salinger had a nine-month
romance. It began when she was an 18-year-old Yale University
freshman and he was a celebrated 53-year-old author who had
retreated from public life to an isolated cottage in Cornish, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard left school to live with Salinger, who abruptly cut
off the relationship in March 1973. She refused to divulge anything
about their relationship for more than 25 years, before recounting
almost every bit of it _ from her sexual inadequacies to his
eccentric diet and fixation on homeopathic medicine, in her 1998
memoir, ``At Home in the World'' (Picador USA, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Now she is selling the 14 letters, which are formal and
avuncular at the outset, turn to love-struck ardor and ultimately
become brusque, chilly and impersonal.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is the latest offshoot of what seems in retrospect a
romantic mismatch that would have made great literary satire: the
obsessively private Salinger and the compulsively confessional Ms.
Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the letters, like a high-intensity flashlight
beamed into a musty attic, are a startlingly intimate glimpse of
the most private and reclusive of American authors. Because
Salinger, now 80, has so zealously guarded his private life and
last wrote for publication in 1965, the letters will surely
intrigue scholars and others interested in his work.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, they are as private as correspondence can be,
essentially love letters to someone he describes almost from the
start as a kindred soul. As such they will no doubt strike many as
a grievous invasion of Salinger's consistently and insistently
stated desire to maintain his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard, who is divorced with three children, said the
decision was simply financial. Sotheby's has estimated that the
letters, which are being sold as a unit, will bring $60,000 to
$80,000. ``I'd rather put my children through college than own a
box full of Salinger's letters,'' she said. ``They were a piece of
my past that I've finished with, and I'd rather use them to help
support my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Salinger's literary agent, Phyllis Westberg, and a lawyer who
has represented him, Marcia Paul, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard has long been criticized by some writers as a
virtual caricature of the confessional bent in American letters.
And just as her memoir was criticized by some as an attempt to
traffic in Salinger's reclusive fame, the sale of the letters will
probably be seen by some in the same light.
</P>
<P>
   Author and critic Cynthia Ozick said of the case: ``What we have
is two celebrities, one who was once upon a time a real writer of
substance and an artist, and one who has never been an artist and
has no real substance and has attached herself to the real artist
in order to suck out his celebrity. It's really such a Jamesian
story, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than criticizing Ms. Maynard, novelist E.L. Doctorow said
he found it unfortunate that a personal relationship ``was being
commodified, as seems to happen with frequency in this country.''
He added, ``I think the word sad is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all Salinger's brief incursions into the public realm
in recent years have been legal efforts to maintain his privacy. In
the most celebrated case, Salinger was successful in 1987 in
blocking the publication of a biography by Ian Hamilton that relied
heavily on unpublished letters Salinger wrote to his friend and
editor, Whit Burnett, and to others, between 1939 and 1961.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Salinger copyrighted the letters, which had been
donated to university libraries, to frustrate Hamilton's plan to
quote extensively from them. Hamilton then radically revised his
book, paraphrasing rather than quoting the letters. But in a ruling
that shocked publishers and biographers, a federal appeals court in
New York ruled that Salinger had the right to protect the contents
of his unpublished writings even from extensive paraphrases that go
beyond the ill-defined ``fair use'' provisions for written
material, as in a review of a book.
</P>
<P>
   The book was again revised and finally published in a very
different form and with a new title, ``In Search of J.D.
Salinger,'' in 1988. Since then his legal and literary
representatives have successfully forced the Film Society of
Lincoln Center in New York to cancel a planned showing of an
Iranian film adapted from his 1961 book ``Franny and Zooey'' and
shut down a Web site about his work.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton case limits the ability of publications, authors
and scholars to quote from letters. But there is no apparent legal
question about Ms. Maynard's right to sell the 38 pages of letters,
which are neatly typed or scrawled in ink or pencil on typing
paper, yellow lined paper and, in one case, on a card from the New
York Public Library. Legal experts say the only apparent legal
challenge to the sale could be over issues of their public display.
</P>
<P>
   The letters begin on April 25, 1972, the day Ms. Maynard's
reminiscence, ``An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Her Life,'' complete
with ingenue photograph, ran as the cover story of The New York
Times Magazine. In the article she presented herself as a character
who could have come from one of Salinger's books _ a true innocent,
part child, part adult, as wearied and put off in her own way by
much of what she sees around her as Salinger's Holden Caulfield is
in ``The Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of letters she received from admirers,
detractors, suitors, editors and producers was a double-spaced,
typewritten letter on a single piece of thin typing paper that came
in a hand-addressed envelope from Cornish, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The writer said he was offering a few unsolicited thoughts ``in
strictest privacy, if you can bear it,'' from a kindred spirit. He
praised her writing, warned her against people who would exploit
her talent, said he was familiar with the perils of such
exploitation and wished her well. It was signed, ``Sincerely, J.D.
Salinger.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote back and received a handwritten letter dated May 2 on
three sheets of lined yellow paper. Salinger thanked her effusively
for her reply, railed on at length about the costs and risks of a
public life and signed off, ``In friendship, partisanship, J.D.
Salinger.''
</P>
<P>
   As the relationship proceeded, the letters became more avid and
intimate. And just the way much of Salinger's fiction seemed a
search for one pure soul in a dirty world, he extravagantly praised
Ms. Maynard while lamenting almost everything around him:
relatives, letter writers and most of all anything having to do
with publishing, public life and the media. He did speak with
fondness of his two children, who shared their time between him and
their mother.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote of feeling deep doubts about virtually every value he
had witnessed in a voice that seemed very much like Holden
Caulfield at 53, now a cranky adult instead of a quirky adolescent.
And if Ms. Maynard is likely to be criticized in some quarters,
Salinger's voice in the letters _ and what will strike some as a
calculated attempt to seduce an 18-year-old girl _ may not seem
nearly as appealing as the voice of his fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Though the letters are written during the Vietnam War era, there
is little in them about politics or anything outside his own life,
aside from an overall distrust of what seems to him the fashion of
being unfashionable. Instead he writes of homeopathy, favored
actors and things he likes: Jane Austen, vaudeville, his daughter's
basketball playing, attending Dartmouth football games with his
son, ``The Andy Griffith Show,'' ``I Love Lucy,'' Alfred Hitchcock
movies. He writes with a New Yorker's sensibility of apartments on
the Upper West Side and said he wrote every day, though it is
apparent he had no thoughts of publishing again.
</P>
<P>
   He writes frequently on the writer's life and lot, but the only
direct reference to any of his published writing comes in response
to her question about how Holden Caulfield managed to cram so much
activity into a single night in ``The Catcher in the Rye.'' He said
he doesn't know, and suggests checking with a newspaper advice
columnist.
</P>
<P>
   In his fourth letter, he sends her his phone number, in the
fifth he proposes a meeting, and by the sixth he sounds like a
love-struck suitor contemplating meeting her parents. The letters
end when she leaves school to move in with him.
</P>
<P>
   The final letter, dated Aug. 17, 1973, after he had broken off
the relationship, ends the correspondence with a chilly thud.
</P>
<P>
   He responds clinically to her questions about ordering
homeopathic publications and how to treat distemper in dogs and
throws in a laundry list of favored remedies. Saying, ``it's late
kiddo,'' he complains that he is tired and has been answering
letters all day and signs off.
</P>
<P>
   The auction is scheduled for June 22, and the letters will be on
display from June 17 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Malinowski, Sotheby's vice president for books and
manuscripts, said Sotheby's sells perhaps 400 lots of letters a
year, but she was hard pressed to think of any in her 13 years
likely to attract as much interest as Salinger's.
</P>
<P>
   She said she had no qualms about the sale despite Salinger's
desire to maintain his privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as the writer has his rights, so does the recipient of
the letters have the right to do what he or she feels is
appropriate with them,'' she said. ``And I think that Joyce Maynard
feels it is appropriate for these letters to be available to
scholars and the outside world for further knowledge and insight
into a great American writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard, who said she planned to attend the auction, said
she had long since stopped worrying about her critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can say to those people, so I just don't try
anymore,'' she said. ``I take Salinger's advice: You'd better not
spend your life looking over your shoulder to see what people are
saying about you.''
</P>
<P>
   As is his custom, Salinger was not available for comment. But he
stated his position on his privacy quite clearly in depositions in
which he was asked what he hoped to gain from preventing Hamilton
from using his letters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll retain a very important sense of privacy, of property
that I really believe is mine,'' he said. ``Privacy is privacy.
Letters were meant for a certain pair of eyes and those eyes
alone.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: BUSY TOURIST SEASON PREDICTED; 2 CITIES ADD
FLIGHTS; AIRLINE PERKS

<P>
   Still haven't made reservations for summer vacation? Well, don't
wait any longer, because the AAA auto club predicted Tuesday that
from Memorial Day through Labor Day (the unofficial summer season)
Americans would make a record 271 million trips of at least 100
miles from home. Over Memorial Day weekend alone, a record 33.3
million people are expected to get away.
</P>
<P>
   The projections for both the summer and Memorial Day represent a
4 percent increase over the respective travel numbers for 1998, a
year in which overall summer travel figures jumped 7 percent from
the summer of 1997. If the projections hold, this Memorial Day will
be the fourth this decade to show an increase of more than 1
million in the number of people traveling at least 100 miles from
home.
</P>
<P>
   The projections are based on an AAA-commissioned national travel
survey of 1,500 adults by the Travel Industry Association of
America.
</P>
<P>
   The AAA also projects that summer travelers can expect increases
of slightly more than 1 percent this year in the costs of meals and
lodging, for an average total of $213 a day for a family of four.
By contrast, an analysis released Monday by Pricewaterhouse Coopers
and Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. forecast that Americans would pay ``much
more'' for summer travel this year over last, because of higher
prices for hotels, fuel, car rentals and, possibly, domestic
leisure air fares.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the actual cost, all parties agree that within three
weeks, the roads and skies of the United States will begin filling
with summer travelers.
</P>
<P>
   2 Cities Add Flights
</P>
<P>
   Business travelers and city officials in New Orleans and
Cleveland expect to benefit mightily next month when Trans World
Airlines begins a new daily nonstop June 1 betweem New Orleans and
Mexico City that originates in New York, and when Continental
Airlines begins daily nonstop service on June 30 between Cleveland
and Gatwick Airport in London.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans officials expect the TWA flight to increase
corporate and leisure travel to their city by millions of dollars a
year, and to position New Orleans as a hub for commerce with Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Projections for the Cleveland-London flight, the first nonstop
flight between Cleveland and Europe, are that it will add about
$200 million a year to the economy of northeastern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   To attract the TWA flight, which will be the only daily nonstop
between New Orleans and Mexico City, several corporations _
including Harrah's Entertainment, which expects to open a New
Orleans casino this fall _ agreed to buy an undisclosed number of
tickets for an undisclosed price for a certain period. In addition,
New Orleans International Airport agreed to reduced TWA's landing
fees for that flight.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland-London flight is symbolic of Continental's steady
expansion at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport _ to 268 daily
departures currently from 205 in 1995. But it did not hurt matters
that $120 million is being spent to expand the airport, including
$92 million for a concourse for Continental's regional carrier,
Express Jet, scheduled to begin service Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With aircraft flying so full over the last couple of years, it
is tempting to conclude that passengers will automatically flock to
each new flight. Not so. Which is why airlines often start or
cancel routes, add or reduce frequencies, fly seasonal schedules
and change the size of the planes used on particular routes.
</P>
<P>
   Airline Perks
</P>
<P>
   Fly first class or business class to Japan before May 31 and
Japan Airlines will give you your choice of up to $300 in American

Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Fly United Airlines and stay at a Hilton Hotel and you will earn
points in Hilton's HHonors program and also in United's
frequent-flier program, Mileage Plus. The offer is good through May
31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hotels
</P>
<P>
   U.S. hotels won 5 of the 10 spots in Gourmet magazine's ranking
of the best hotels in the world, and one of them _ the Halekulani
Honolulu _ came in first The others were the Ritz-Carlton, Naples,
Fla. (No. 6); the Boulders, Carefree, Ariz. (7); the Greenbrier,
White Sulphur Springs, W.Va. (8) and the Phoenician, Scottsdale,
Ariz. (9). The survey of the magazine's readers was conducted by
the Willard &AMP; Shullman market research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The renovated 210-room Sheraton Phoenix Airport Hotel has
reopened in Tempe, Ariz., with an executive club, conference center
and other amenities for business travelers. In Aurora, Colo., the
157-room Hilton Garden Inn Denver Airport is open for business,

EMBASSY BOMBING POINTS OUT PROBLEMS IN PENTAGON MAPPING AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon agency that drew up the outdated map
used in the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade has been
embroiled in at least two other international incidents in the last
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The National Imagery and Mapping Agency prepared the maps for
the crew of the Marine Corps jet that struck a ski-lift cable in
February 1998 near Aviano, Italy, leaving 20 people dead. The cable
did not appear on the maps, agency officials said, because the
towers supporting it were under 100 feet tall, the minimum height
that was required to be shown on the map.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA was blindsided a year ago when India tested a nuclear
device, and many intelligence experts blamed the dearth of
experienced analysts in the new agency for its inability to detect
preparations for the explosion. Satellites and analysts alike
failed to focus on the nuclear test site, despite signs that a test
was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Formation of the National Imagery and Mapping Agency from parts
of the Pentagon and the CIA three years ago ignited an uproar among
intelligence officials. The primary goal was to provide battlefield
commanders with speedier intelligence, especially from
reconnaissance satellites and U-2 spy planes. By merging several
agencies, the government also expected to save money.
</P>
<P>
   But many senior CIA photographic analysts perceived their new
assignments to the mapping agency as drudge work, and they either
retired or sought transfers to other government jobs, continuing an
exodus that began in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Some influential lawmakers have decried the embassy bombing as a
sign that U.S. intelligence capabilities are stretched too thin and
as evidence that the new mapping agency is not working.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little premature to reach any conclusions about whether
this combined agency is working well or not, but the debate has
opened up again,'' Rep. Porter J. Goss, R-Fla., who heads the House
Intelligence Committee and who opposed the agency's creation, said
in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The accidental bombing has touched off a furious round of finger
pointing among various Pentagon and intelligence officials. There
is plenty of blame to go around, from the CIA analysts who picked
the target to the military data bases that had an old address for
the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   This is important because the geographic coordinates of targets
are checked against the data bases in order to attempt to avoid
civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Even though China moved its embassy in 1996 from Belgrade's old
quarter to a newer portion of the city, that information was never
transmitted to the agency's mapping experts or put into many of the
government's data bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had high-level officials who have visited the new Chinese
embassy, but they have not placed a call out to the agency or to
the department saying, `By the way, we're at the new embassy,' ''
Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate Appropriations
Committee on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At ground zero in all this is the little-known, 7,000-member
organization tucked away in an old Army building in Bethesda, Md.
The agency is a hybrid of eight defense and intelligence agencies,
principally the Pentagon's Defense Mapping Agency and the CIA's
National Photographic Intelligence Center, which was spawned by
complaints from Gulf War commanders that they lacked up-to-date
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency sought to break down barriers between military
mapmakers and intelligence analysts of airborne reconnaissance
photographs, with the aim of whisking a polished report to troops
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   But combining the two organizations has been a bumpy process,
despite upbeat reports from field commanders like Gen. Anthony
Zinni, whose Central Command has responsibility for the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   The cadre of scientific and technical experts who analyzed the
satellite data dwindled through resignations and retirements,
intelligence experts said, and was gradually supplanted by a
younger work force steeped more in political science than
scientific testing.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the intelligence analysts responsible for
interpreting spy satellite photographs are less skilled and less
experienced than their predecessors of 10 years ago, at the end of
the Cold War, said some present and former intelligence officials,
including Gordon Oehler, who retired last year as director of the
CIA's Nonproliferation Center.
</P>
<P>
   NIMA officials insist the criticism is unfair and say that as
trouble spots erupt around the world, their analysts are being
asked to analyze more and faster, while Congress in recent years
has kept cutting the agency's budget, which is classified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fallacy is, if you combine eight unfunded agencies into
one, they'll be fully funded,'' one agency official said Tuesday.
``Everyone's looking for savings.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's director, Army Lt. Gen. James C. King, was
unavailable for comment Tuesday, a committee spokeswoman, Laura
Snow, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIMA is understaffed and underfunded,'' said Sen. Richard
Shelby, R-Ala., who heads the Senate Intelligence Committee. He
observed that the panel had increased the agency's funds one day
before the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Goss, while insisting that the agency is adequately financed,
acknowledged a crucial shortfall in intelligence analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very definitely gotten into a situation with NIMA
where we literally have roomfuls of collected intelligence material
and not enough good analysts,'' he said. ``When you have that, it's
a catastrophe waiting to happen.''

TEXAS SETS SIGHTS ON PAYING COLLEGE COSTS FOR FORMER POW GONZALES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
and PATTY REINERT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Texas Senate gave former prisoner of war
Steven Gonzales a special welcome home Tuesday: a free ride at the
Texas public college of his choice.
</P>
<P>
   It unanimously approved and sent to the House a measure to allow
Texans classified as POWs on or after Jan. 1, 1999, free tuition,
fees, room, board and books. Before the Senate can make good on its
offer, though, the Texas House must also pass Senate Bill 1902 and
Gov. George W. Bush must sign it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's wonderful,'' Gonzales said of the legislation when
contacted at home in Huntsville. ``It's really neat to be honored
in that way and I'd like to go back to (Texas) A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll turn that yellow ribbon into a full scholarship,'' said
Sen. Steve Ogden, a College Station Republican whose district
covers Texas A&AMP;M. Lawmakers had sported yellow ribbons on their
lapels during the month that Gonzales and two other U.S. soldiers
were held captive by Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is telling our POWs that we welcome them back home
after the horrors of imprisonment in a foreign land and that we
want them to have the opportunity of completing a good education in
appreciation for their service and dedication to us,'' said Sen.
Eddie Lucio Jr., D-Brownsville, who sponsored the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales is the only person who would currently qualify under
the bill. An honors student in high school, he left Texas A&AMP;M in
1996 after his freshman year to join the Army. Financial concerns
and an urge to travel prompted him and a friend to join the
military, his parents have said. He was majoring in mechanical
engineering and said he eventually plans to complete a degree in
some type of engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Army specialist was captured March 31 by Serbian
forces along the Yugoslavia-Macedonia border along with Staff Sgts.
Christopher Stone of Michigan and Andrew Ramirez of California. All
three were freed May 2.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales said Tuesday he had enjoyed a quiet weekend at his
uncle's home in Dallas, visiting with his two younger brothers, his
parents and other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be home, and I really just want to thank
everybody,'' he said.

DOPING CONTROVERSY EMBROILS TOP CYCLIST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ Star cyclist Richard Virenque has acknowledged using
banned performance-enhancing drugs, the police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Virenque is the former leader of the Festina team that was
expelled from last year's Tour de France for doping. The police
said that the 29-year-old French cyclist confessed that he had used
products supplied by Bertrand Sainz, one of five people under
investigation for involvement in an alleged drug-supplying network.
</P>
<P>
   Sainz, a horse breeder who is well known in bicycle racing
circles, was seized by the Paris drug squad last week and is being
held.
</P>
<P>
   But Virenque did not say that he had used erythropoietin, know
as EPO, an artificial endurance-boosting hormone that was at the
center of the Tour de France doping scandal, or human growth
hormone, another illegal drug .
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the police sources said, he acknowledged only that he
had used homeopathic products, some of which are illegal in the
sport but common otherwise, such as aspirin substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   But Agence France-Presse reported that Virenque's lawyer,
Gilbert Collard, said that his client had not admitted any doping
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   After initially balking Tuesday, the rider agreed to medical
tests of his blood, urine and hair by the police to determine
whether he had taken performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the majority of the nine-man Festina team in the Tour,
and despite the testimony of the team's director, doctor and
masseur, Virenque had never said he was involved in illegal drugs.
The four-time top climber in the Tour and the second-place finisher
two years ago, he now rides for the Polti team in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Sainz is accused of setting up a drug-distribution network along
with a lawyer, Bertrand Lavelot, who has represented Virenque in
his battle against doping allegations. Lavelot is also under
investigation and is being held by the drug squad.
</P>
<P>
   Virenque's reported confession followed a police report that he
had been heard asking for drugs after the police tapped Lavelot's
phone. The report gave no date for the request.
</P>
<P>
   Held for questioning, but later released, Virenque was not
formally charged. On Monday, in a hearing in Lille as part of a
separate police investigation into last year's Tour de France
scandal, Virenque continued to deny any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Another star rider, Frank Vandenbroucke, acknowledged Tuesday
that he also used products supplied by Sainz, but said he was
convinced that the products were homeopathic.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from his home in Belgium, Vandenbroucke, the
seventh-ranked rider in the world, said, ``I was naive but not
dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Belgian and a French teammate, Philippe Gaumont,
were both suspended by their sponsor, Cofidis, Monday after they
too were seized by the Paris drug squad last week. Gaumont is under
continuing police investigation, but Vandenbroucke is not.
</P>
<P>
   Vandenbroucke said he had been helped by Sainz's treatments,
which he described as involving homeopathic substances and periods
of fasting to cleanse his system. Sainz later gave him injections,
assuring Vandenbroucke that the products were legal, the rider
said. He added that he had paid 7,000 French francs ($1,100) for
the substances and 50,000 francs in doctors' fees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the scandal continued to widen, two leading Spanish teams,
ONCE and Banesto, warned that they might not compete in this year's
Tour de France. They were among five teams that pulled out of last
year's race to protest police actions in a crackdown on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams said they would not return if conditions for the
teams and riders are similar to last year, when the police raided
team hotels and a ONCE doctor was placed under investigation on
doping charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't go to the Tour just to retire later,'' the Banesto
manager, Jose Miguel Echavarri, told the Spanish newspaper El
Mundo.
</P>
<P>
   Manolo Saiz, the directeur sportif for ONCE, said, ``It's still
too early to know how far the detentions and court procedures are
going to go. It's clear that it can't carry on like this. The
stories coming out of France are very worrying.'' &QL;

IN PRAISE OF THE MOST UNPOPULAR GIRL AT LAWNDALE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The older I get, the more I think about high school. This may
explain my current, unseemly attachment to ``Dawson's Creek,'' a WB
nighttime soap aimed at 14-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday night, its heroine Joey Potter (played by the
unnaturally beautiful Katie Holmes) breezes through difficulties _
a classmate's accidental drowning, learning that the boy she's
dating is gay, her on-again, off-again romance with Dawson (James
Van Der Beek) _ with verbal and physical aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   Problems just seem to make Joey cuter and more articulate. If
things get really bad, she may bite her lip or push her hair behind
her ears, which makes her look even more like Natalie Wood sometime
between ``Miracle on 34th Street'' and ``Splendor in the Grass.''
</P>
<P>
   But I could never have been Joey. This is a girl who can hear
the boy she has loved since childhood say he wants her back and
dismiss him with the poise of Michelle Pfeiffer channeling Myrna
Loy, exiting through his bedroom window as if she were climbing
into a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, Jack,'' she once told a guy, ``not every
moment with you is sexually charged.'' I couldn't pull off that
sort of thing when I was 30. Or ever.
</P>
<P>
   No, the teen-age girl I really might have been, if I'd had the
courage, is over on MTV. She's smart, bitter and animated, a blend
of Dorothy Parker, Fran Lebowitz and Janeane Garofalo, wearing
Carrie Donovan's glasses. She is the star of ``Daria,'' the epitome
of suburban teen-age irony.
</P>
<P>
   Daria Morgendorffer, 16 and cursed with a functioning brain, has
the misfortune to see high school, her family and her life for
exactly what they are and the temerity to comment on it. When asked
to share her goals in life with other students in a classroom,
Daria declines. When pressed, she answers, ``My goal is not to wake
up at 40 with the bitter realization that I've wasted my life in a
job I hate because I was forced to decide on a career in my
teens.''
</P>
<P>
   Daria is the kind of girl who reads ``Heart of Darkness'' and
Edgar Allan Poe's ``Telltale Heart'' in class. (Brittany the
cheerleader, who wears double blond ponytails and a teddy bear
backpack, thinks the latter is a Harlequin romance.) Nobody gets to
Daria and nobody impresses her.
</P>
<P>
   When her essay ``My So-Called Angst'' wins an award, Val, 28,
the trendy editor of Val magazine, comes to visit its author and to
research ``the hidden heart of high school.'' Soon Val is planning
an article on ``cheerleading as the new yoga,'' and Daria is
observing, ``Edgy and icky are so hard to tell apart these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Daria the character made her debut on MTV's less verbal animated
series ``Beavis and Butt-head'' in 1994. ``Daria'' the show had its
premiere in March 1997, when the title character transferred to a
new school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to think that I've helped her come out of her shell,''
says Glenn Eichler, who created the original character and is
co-creator, with Susie Lewis Lynn, of the series. The secret of
Daria's popularity (everywhere but in her own home and school) may
be our collective alienation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently everyone, with the exception of a very few people
who were hit on the head when they were very young, felt like they
were outsiders,'' says Eichler. ``You either identify with her as
an outsider or you sort of envy her ability to navigate her life as
an outsider and stay sane.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there are some people who just like her because she
says mean things. As far as I can tell, with her show well into its
third season (new episodes start again on June 30), Daria has never
cracked a smile.
</P>
<P>
   And her tastes are a little dark. When she reluctantly signs up
to read to the elderly at the Better Days Retirement House, she
chooses to read Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl!'' (``I saw the best minds
of my generation destroyed by madness'').
</P>
<P>
   The Morgendorffers don't even seem to notice that Daria
constantly gives them lip. When Daria's mother, a
cell-phone-addicted workaholic lawyer, explains, ``There's no
course that can teach you to be a perfect mother,'' Daria answers
in a snap, ``That's obvious.'' And nobody sends her to her room.
</P>
<P>
   Her misguided father, who viewers learned in one episode was
actually at Altamont (it was sort of the violent Woodstock), is
usually oblivious. He suffers from road rage and, when the pesto
doesn't go right, stove rage.
</P>
<P>
   But the greatest burden on the home front is Daria's terminally
cute, popular little sister, Quinn. Quinn and her pals constitute
Lawndale High's Fashion Club (``Friends don't let shortwaisted
friends wear hip-huggers'' is one of their mottos). Quinn tells
people that Daria is her cousin or just an unrelated girl who lives
with her.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Daria has a best friend, whom she met in
low-self-esteem class. Jane Lane knows all of Daria's peculiarities
and still loves her. ``You're a twisted little cruller, ain't
you?'' she says. ``That's why I'm proud to be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Daria's only discernible weakness, in fact, is her silent
intense crush on Jane's spiky-haired brother, Trent. Trent plays in
a band called Mystik Spiral, whose signature song seems to be ``Ow,
My Nose! Ow, My Face!'' And the absolute proof that Jane is a good
friend is that she knows how Daria feels about Trent and will
never, ever tell.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the only real teen-agers this confident and articulate
are time travelers, like Kathleen Turner in ``Peggy Sue Got
Married,'' who have the chance, literally, to know then what they
know now. Until time travel is perfected, Daria is my idol.

PLAYING IT BACK AGAIN: LONE BLACK MAN IN A RACIST WORLD  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mo.)   (af)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After making a name for himself largely by playing
slick gangsters, Don Cheadle was given the kind of breakout offer
that actors pray for: the part of Sammy Davis Jr. in the HBO movie
``The Rat Pack.''
</P>
<P>
   He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was not concern about his ability to emulate Davis'
remarkable versatility; Cheadle is a trained jazz musician who can
sing and dance too. The issue was that despite Davis' ``Baby, this
is a gas'' facade, he was a lone black man struggling for
recognition and dignity in the white, racist world of the late
1950s and '60s, and yet the original script barely mentioned the
humiliations he endured or how they affected him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to play that guy who says, `Race doesn't
matter,''' said Cheadle. ``Race always matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle ended up expressing his concerns to Rob Cohen, the
director, who said he was so eager to enlist Cheadle that he had
the part rewritten to show Davis' emotional struggle. Cheadle went
on to play the character with such charm and pathos that he won a
Golden Globe Award and took a big step toward opening up his
career.
</P>
<P>
   But in some respects the role was just a continuation of a part
that Cheadle, 34, said he had been playing much of his life, and
certainly since his high school days in a Denver suburb _ a
talented, lone black man, smooth on the outside but vulnerable
inside, struggling for recognition and dignity in an overwhelmingly
white world.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any African-American can feel the sting of being in
the minority, but growing up in a suburb that was even whiter than
the country at large, Cheadle said, made the issues more present
and pressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he could have rendered such a vivid performance
if he hadn't had similar experiences,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   It is a role that Cheadle is exploring again, if in a slightly
different context, as Grant Wiggins in HBO's ``Lesson Before
Dying'' (Saturday at 8 p.m.), based on the 1993 novel by Ernest J.
Gaines.
</P>
<P>
   Here Cheadle is a proud and snobbish man eager to break out of a
dirt-poor black community in the South of the 1940s, where he
teaches shoeless children in overalls. He looks down on the
tight-knit community as a world without hope, one that he longs to
escape.
</P>
<P>
   But when Grant is asked to instruct a condemned black field
hand, Jefferson, on how to go to his execution with dignity, if
only to show his white jailers that a human heart beats beneath the
dark skin, Grant learns some hard lessons about his own place in a
racist world and the prospect of never truly escaping it.
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle plays the role with the same cool exterior, broken only
by flashes of wrenching emotion, that marked his portrayal of
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Don really contributed to in this part was the inner side
of the character, the hidden values,'' said Joseph Sargent, the
director. ``He did not shy away at all from playing the character
with all his warts, and it was that much more effective because of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle described the role as a window onto the real world.
``What happens, what Grant explains to Jefferson, is it's not fair,
but he has to deal with the truth,'' said Cheadle. ``Fair works for
4-year-olds. This is about real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheadle was born in Kansas City, Mo., then moved to Lincoln,
Neb., and finally to Colorado, where his father had a practice as a
psychologist. He said he had quietly suffered the wounds and
slights from being so racially isolated and that acting had given
him a brave face to hide behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's why I went into acting,'' said Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   He attended the California Institute of the Arts to develop his
craft and quickly landed impressive parts, with roles in movies
like ``Colors,'' in which he was a gangster, and ``Hamburger Hill''
and in television series like ``Picket Fences,'' in which he played
the district attorney, John Littleton.
</P>
<P>
   His break came in 1995, when he played the humorous but
murderous Mouse in the gangster film ``Devil in a Blue Dress.''
There were some complaints at the time that the movie, which
starred Denzel Washington and had an almost entirely black cast,
had not been marketed aggressively enough.
</P>
<P>
   The movie did not perform impressively at the box office. And
some people felt that Cheadle, who won a Los Angeles Film Critics
Award for his role, should have received an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But, Cheadle said, even his failure to get a nomination received
such publicity that it advanced his career and helped lead to roles
in movies like ``Bulworth,'' ``Out of Sight,'' ``Volcano'' and
``Rosewood.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these characters were strikingly ambiguous, tough as
well as vulnerable, as he was playing Buck in ``Boogie Nights,''
for example. In that film he portrayed a sweet-natured porn star
who favored western garb and had a dream of getting married and
opening Buck's Super Cool Stereo World at a strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in ``Out of Sight,'' based on an Elmore Leonard
novel, he played Snoopy, a psychopathic killer and drug dealer who
could switch in a minute from lighthearted banter to handing out
guns and hatchets to his gang, preparing to slaughter a customer
with an overdue account.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's director, Steven Soderbergh, said the slipperiness
of Snoopy's character and his surprising mood switches were all
traits that Cheadle had brought to the character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sensed from the first read-through that Don was incapable of
doing anything typical,'' said Soderbergh. ``He has an innate knack
for avoiding the obvious and especially in this character he didn't
resort to the kind of histrionics another actor would have.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``Don is one of those actors who is so intense
that if the other actors are not up for a scene, they're going to
get smoked. It's not like he's Mr. Thespian, but you have to be
ready. But he's very generous with other actors. If you mention him
to other actors, their eyes light up.''
</P>
<P>
   In spite of his recent successes, however, Cheadle was
frustrated, he said, by his not having received bigger offers. He
acknowledged that he was unlikely to become a major romantic star,
as a small number of other black actors have become, and that his
options were somewhat limited because of the dearth of parts for
black character actors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's like Denzel, Wesley, Fish, Eddie, and then there's the
rest of us,'' said Cheadle, referring to Denzel Washington, Wesley
Snipes, Laurence Fishburne and Eddie Murphy. ``Yeah, it's slim
pickings.''
</P>
<P>
   Several people, including Cheadle, said they believed he would
probably be getting more high-profile opportunities, like the
character of Grant in ``A Lesson Before Dying,'' if he were not a
black man in a business that was still overwhelmingly white.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Screen Actors Guild recently released a study
showing that the number of roles going to African-Americans,
Latinos, Asian-Americans and American Indians in movies and
television declined in 1998 for the first time since 1992, when the
guild began to collect the figures.
</P>
<P>
   The roles for African-Americans, the guild said, dropped from
14.1 percent of all roles in movies and prime-time television in
1997 to 13.4 percent of all roles cast last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question if you had the white equivalent of Don, in
terms of the talent and kinds of movies he's been in,'' said
Soderbergh, ``every studio in town would be elbowing each other to
have a deal with him and they would be making pictures built around
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cheadle said, he feels lucky to be broadening his
repertory. He is about to begin filming ``Mission to Mars,'' for
Disney, in which he plays the first astronaut to set foot on Mars.
He said he would also like to do some comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a character actor, but so is Dustin Hoffman,'' said
Cohen. ``He will carry a movie. He has those serious chops. There
is so much emotion he puts into it, so many colors on his
palette.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cheadle said he also remained keen on developing characters
who connect with his central concerns about being a black man in a
white society. He has, for instance, been trying to develop a film
version of ``Groomed,'' a play he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It follows a group of young black men who find themselves stuck
in a hotel room in Nebraska the day that a contentious football
game between the University of Nebraska and the University of
Oklahoma sends white fans rioting through the streets in a
murderous mood.
</P>
<P>
   The script is a long meditation on how these black men deal with
racism in such a threatening situation, and how violence between
the races seems both tragic and unavoidable. Ultimately, Cheadle
said, it is about the feeling of being trapped in a hostile world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get at the truth of the experience, which I
really understood,'' he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: ELECTRICITY IN THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Good grief. After a dismal lockout and a dreary
season, the Knicks are still with us and, not only that, they have
a chance to be around for a while.
</P>
<P>
   For all their troubles, deficiencies, slumps, weaknesses, flaws,
gaps, you name it, they will play Miami Wednesday night in a
Madison Square Garden that will seek to muster all the energy of
the really good years.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of emotion stored up in the Garden after a tepid
and abbreviated season. The Garden has rarely come alive this year,
and when it did, it was often for the most electric player on the
Knicks, the anti-Frazier, the anti-Bradley, Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing I can do is have a big start,'' Sprewell said
Tuesday. ``A steal or a dunk early, connect with the crowd. That
will carry over to the rest of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell does not exactly play like all the guys on the banners
hanging from the rafters. His on-court version of ``Hit the Open
Man'' _ the mantra of the Red Holzman years _ is to stage a
solitary fast break against two or three defenders.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Garden crowd loves him because he changes the
plodding tempo of the Knicks, as they gamely try to slow the game
down for their big-hearted but sore-ankled Patrick Ewing. Sprewell
has the same impact of the early John Starks, minus the
chest-thumping, but he is taller and more agile, and has come along
during the doldrums at the big barn on Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks haven't jelled for more than a game at a time, and
part of the fault is obviously Sprewell's. The crowd has been
forced to stifle its own elitist ``Dee-fense'' history and root for
the guy with the braids (to say nothing of his history of
coach-throttling.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best fans in the world; they'll be pumped,''
Sprewell said Tuesday after practice. ``They make a lot of noise,
up on their feet. You can tell they want us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Knicks fans like to think they are the hippest fans in all
creation, but Sprewell said they are also the noisiest. He would
like to ignite them early Wednesday night, in a totally crucial
game as the Knicks try to win two at home, to avoid a fifth and
deciding game in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprewell is going to perform any electrification, he will
have to do it off the bench. He has been the sixth man most of the
season, and chafed about it at one point, when his agent popped off
about starting next year or being traded.
</P>
<P>
   That has been the only disruptive sign from Sprewell this
season. His occasional wild romps on the court and his defensive
lapses are merely part of his game _ nothing personal, that is.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you did not know any better, you would not take
Sprewell for the chap who locked his 10 large fingers around the
vulnerable throat of his coach, P.J. Carlesimo, during a Golden
State practice last season.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Sprewell during a group interview session, it
is hard to forget that he basically lost it in a very physical
manner, and paid a huge price for it _ suspended after 14 games
last season, at the cost of $6.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, his reputation for anger and menace does not show in
his daily demeanor. It is easy to see why Dave Checketts was
impressed enough after a personal interview to trade for Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Not to exaggerate, but Sprewell is one of the more approachable
Knicks, at least from the standpoint of the working press, and he
seems quite rational.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell had said he was looking forward to his first playoff
experience since 1994, when the Warriors went out in three
straight. He and Allan Houston shot well to help the Knicks win the
first game in Miami, but both were somewhat out of control in the
second game, as the ball seemed to squirt away from them.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much that they were mishandling the ball, however,
as it was the Miami defenders getting their hands (and knees, and
elbows, and their entire trunks) in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more us than them,'' Sprewell said. ``We didn't play as
smart as we had been. In the playoffs, it's obviously more intense
than the regular season. Teams do more scouting and they have time
to prepare for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the court, Sprewell talks calmly about ``game plans,'' but
when he leaps off the bench, he seems oblivious to some of the
finer points. That is part of his charm, and Wednesday night the
Garden crowd will forget the ancient finesse and root for Sprewell
to turn on the juice.
</P>

ENERGY SECRETARY ANNOUNCES PROGRAM TO STRENGTHEN LAB SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vowing to assert his direct control over the
government's fiercely independent nuclear weapons laboratories,
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on Tuesday announced a
wide-ranging program to strengthen security after allegations that
China has repeatedly pried nuclear secrets out of the labs.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing that he plans to name a new Energy Department
``security czar,'' Richardson acknowledged that the move was part
of his effort to fundamentally alter the relationship between the
weapons labs and the Energy Department, which owns them. In the
past, Richardson conceded, the major labs have circumvented
dictates from energy secretaries, often with the help of friendly
and powerful allies in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He said the independence of the labs, and their ability to
exploit informal political channels to get money from Congress
without going through the Energy Department, have allowed lab
officials to ignore recommendations from Washington to improve
security and counter-intelligence measures and to screen foreign
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who previously represented the New Mexico
congressional district that includes Los Alamos National
Laboratory, which is now at the center of the spy scandal, knows
that he will not be able to cut off the labs' ties to Congress. But
he insists that his reorganization will improve the labs' efforts
on security and counter-intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run the labs now,'' Richardson said. ``This was not the case
in the past. Secretaries in the past did not tackle these things
because of the constituencies involved and because of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   The new security ``czar'' will be a senior official who will
report directly to Richardson and will oversee all security-related
functions, including offices handling computer security, nuclear
material control, and background checks on foreign visitors to the
labs.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who came to the Energy Department last year, made it
clear that his actions were in response to his own frustrations
with the way lab officials have dealt with him. He complained that
he ``used to ask for information on foreign visitors to the labs,
and I couldn't get straight answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also plans to consolidate security-related budgets
for various labs and other facilities into one $800 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Confronting criticism on Capitol Hill for failing to prevent a
scientist already suspected of being a spy for China from
transferring huge amounts of secret data out of a classified
computer system at Los Alamos, Richardson also announced a $50
million increase over two years in funding for computer-related
security measures. That comes on top of an $8 million increase he
proposed in March, soon after the furor began.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also said that the Energy Department will tighten
security controls over floppy disk drives and other devices that
could be used to remove or download files from classified computer
networks. That action comes after lawmakers expressed outrage last
week that new computersecurity measures imposed by the labs in
April still would not prevent downloads from classified computers
onto removable disks.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department will also require that electronic
``banners'' be posted on office computer networks throughout the
department and the labs that alert computer users that they are
working on a government system subject to search and review by
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Alamos case, the office computer of the chief
suspect, Wen Ho Lee, was not searched until March, even though he
had been under investigation since 1996. Officials say that the FBI
was turned down by the Justice Department in 1997 when it requested
approval to seek a warrant that would have allowed FBI agents to
tap Lee's phone and covertly monitor his computer.
</P>
<P>
   While Lee had signed a standard Los Alamos waiver in 1995
acknowledging that the lab had the right to audit his computer use,
the FBI decided that waiver was not enough to make any evidence
they found in Lee's computer admissible in court. FBI attorneys
decided that since the Justice Department had rejected the bureau's
request for a search warrant, the standard waiver would not stand
up as legal justification for searching his computer.
</P>
<P>
   A banner on screens constantly warning users that their
computers were subject to search and examination would provide a
more solid legal foundation. Richardson also said that he is
placing an 18-month moratorium on the declassification of Cold
War-era Energy Department documents. A declassification of
weapons-related data begun in 1993 by former Energy Secretary Hazel
O'Leary has been widely criticized among intelligence officials who
say it compromised some American nuclear secrets.

AMERICA ONLINE CHALLENGES MICROSOFT'S WEBTV 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only weeks after completing the purchase of Netscape
Communications Corp. _ Microsoft Corp.'s archrival in Web browsing
software _ America Online Inc. announced Tuesday that it would take
on Microsoft in delivering the Internet over television sets.
</P>
<P>
   The new product, to be known as AOL TV, will compete directly
with Microsoft's WebTV, which already has about 800,000 users.
</P>
<P>
   AOL TV will be built around four partnerships announced Tuesday,
including a deal with Hughes Electronics, to deliver high-speed
access to America Online and the Internet via home satellite
dishes.
</P>
<P>
   The deals reinforce a growing rivalry between America Online and
Microsoft, which last week announced that it had invested $5
billion in AT&AMP;T to prepare for the convergence of
telecommunications and computing.
</P>
<P>
   That convergence, which will among other things bring high-speed
Internet access into homes over television cable systems, poses a
huge threat to America Online and other Internet service providers.
America Online, which was built around dial-up modem technology,
stands to lose many of its 17 million subscribers if they find
speed more alluring than the comfort of America Online's content,
design and features.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to deals America Online announced earlier for local
phone companies to provide high-speed access to its members, two
partnerships announced Tuesday _ with Hughes Network Systems and
DirecTV, both subsidiaries of the satellite giant Hughes
Electronics _ pave the way for America Online to be packaged with
DirecTV, the most widely used home-based satellite television
system, with 7 million users.
</P>
<P>
   America Online also announced partnerships with Philips
Electronics to create a set-top box for sending and delivering
material from the World Wide Web over telephone lines and other
cables. The box will be powered by National Semiconductor's GX
processor, a computer on a single chip _ a major break for
National, which last week announced that it was abandoning its
financially disastrous Cyrix line of processors, which compete with
Intel Corp.'s Pentium line.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another snub of Microsoft, America Online announced that
it was working with Network Computer Inc., a subsidiary of Oracle
Corp., to develop an operating system for AOL TV.
</P>
<P>
   Network Computer already builds set-top box operating systems in
Europe and Asia to compete against WebTV. Its alignment with
America Online will ``add momentum to a competitor to Microsoft,''
said Van Baker, director of consumer market research for Dataquest.
``This clearly reinforces the rivalry between AOL and Microsoft,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft purchased WebTV in August 1997 for $425 million. It
offers two pricing options, a standard service for $24.95 a month
and a slimmed-down version for $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement helped boost the entire technology
sector, and all participants in the deal enjoyed gains. America
Online jumped 13 1/8 to close at 141 7/16, a gain of more than 10
percent. Hughes Electronics, a division of General Motors, rose 2
to close at 60 5/8, while National Semiconductor closed at 20 3/16,
up 9/16. Koninklijke Philips Electronics NV gained 1 3/16 to close
at 90 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft rose 3/16 to 79 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said the success of AOL TV would depend on what type of
content the company planned to deliver over television sets. He
said WebTV had learned that consumers were not very enthusiastic
about general surfing of the Web. As a result, the company now
emphasize content that enhances the television experience, such as
highlighting Web pages associated with a given TV program.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, Barry Schuler, president of America Online's
interactive services group, said his company did not plan simply to
stream the service's existing content onto television, but to
create ``an entirely different service'' that would emphasize
combining television and the Internet. For example, users could
chat with other viewers of the same program or could visit Web
sites associated with a program or could shop for, say, an album
while watching MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said the company planned to have a service available
sometime next year but had not yet made a decision on pricing.
</P>
<P>
   He said America Online planned to make more announcements in the
coming weeks regarding other providers of set-top boxes and
partners who would provide technologies to deliver America Online
over handheld devices, pagers and cellular telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Schuler said AOL TV would be marketed primarily to the company's
existing subscribers. He said members use the service 55 minutes a
day on average and were likely to be interested in porting the
experience to the TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer will continue to be the anchor that people use to
get started,'' he said of the Internet experience, ``but as they
are incorporating it into their lives more and more, they will use
other devices in the household.''
</P>
<P>
   As to whether America Online and Microsoft will end up competing
or cooperating in the set-top box space, Schuler said he was
``anxiously awaiting'' word about whether Microsoft would be
interested in providing AOL TV over WebTV or through the 5 million
set-top boxes it will be producing for AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   William Keating, general manager of the platform division for
WebTV, said: ``I don't have a position on that. It's a complicated
question. I'm sure if we entered into discussions, we'd be happy to
talk with them.''

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Mike Pegram was dead set against running his
3-year-old filly, Silverbulletday, against the boys in the Kentucky
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Now the owner seems to believe running her Saturday in the
Preakness Stakes is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   What's the difference?
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, there isn't a 20-horse field'' in the Preakness,
Pegram said. ``When I saw what happened at the Derby, I just looked
up at the sky and said, `Thank you for not having my filly in
there.' That was like a Roller Derby.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram said Silverbulletday, who easily won the April 30
Kentucky Oaks the day before The Derby, will be entered Wednesday
for the 13/16-mile Preakness at Pimlico Race Course, the second leg
of thoroughbred racing's Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't necessarily mean she will run. She also was
entered in Friday's Black-Eyed Susan Stakes for fillies, the
Maryland equivalent of the Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will be made Wednesday, based in part on what post
position she draws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to (trainer) Bobby (Baffert) and (jockey) Gary
(Stevens),'' Pegram said. ``But as it sits right now, she's going
in the Preakness.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert also is planning to enter his other filly, Excellent
Meeting, who finished fifth in the Kentucky Derby. She was entered
Tuesday in the Black-Eyed Susan and will be entered Wednesday in
the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Pimlico track is narrower than Churchill Downs', the
Preakness field is limited to 14 starters.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday and Excellent Meeting turned in strong workouts
Monday and Tuesday at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. Each was
timed in 59 seconds for five furlongs. They are to be flown to
Baltimore Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only four fillies have won the Preakness, the last being Nellie
Morse in 1924.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she continues to run like she's training, I think she can
beat the boys,'' Pegram said of Silverbulletday. ``That's why she's
in there right now.''
PRIME TIMBER TO SKIP PREAKNESS
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said Prime Timber, fourth in the Derby, will skip the
Preakness and start in the Sir Barton Stakes on the undercard.
After First American defected with an injury, that leaves 14 or 15
likely entrants, depending on the status of local long shot Lead Em
Home.
</P>
<P>
   Pimlico officials are almost certainly rooting for Lead Em Home
to stay in the barn. If Lead Em Home is entered, either Valhol or
Torrid Sand would be excluded based on career earnings. To decide
which one, the track would be forced to take a position on the
continuing Arkansas Derby controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Valhol's Arkansas Derby purse was ordered stripped last week by
the Arkansas State Racing Commission, which concluded that jockey
Billy Patin carried an illegal electrical device. Torrid Sand was
moved from third to second place.
</P>
<P>
   However, Valhol's owner, James Jackson of Rockport, obtained a
court order before the Kentucky Derby to force Oaklawn Park to
credit Valhol with the Arkansas Derby purse.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas commission attorney Byron Freeland said he believes
that order remains in effect. Pimlico director of racing Lenny Hale
said Tuesday that if a decision has to be made at entry time
Wednesday, the court order probably will be honored.
</P>
<P>
   That would put Valhol into the race at $344,100 with local
riding star Edgar Prado aboard and force Torrid Sand _ also
excluded from the Kentucky Derby _ back to the sidelines at
$91,400.
</P>
<P>
   But if Pimlico should instead side with the Arkansas commission
verdict, Torrid Sand ($141,400) would get into the Preakness, and
Valhol ($44,100) would rank 15th behind Lead Em Home ($95,487) and
go instead in the Sir Barton Stakes.
TRAINING HARD
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was a busy day for final workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Derby winner Charismatic went five furlongs in 1:01,
and D. Wayne Lukas stablemate Cat Thief went in 50 1/5 seconds for
a half-mile, both at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Other five-furlong workouts at Churchill were recorded by
Patience Game (:58 3/5) and Worldly Manner (1:00 2/5). Also going a
half-mile, or four furlongs, was Torrid Sand (:48 1/5).
</P>
<P>
   Vicar topped the Pimlico work tab with his five furlongs in 59
3/5 seconds. The Nick Zito-trained duo of Adonis (1:01 3/5) and
Stephen Got Even (1:01 4/5) worked the same distance. Lead Em Home
went four furlongs in 49 seconds, and Valhol was timed in 50
seconds. nn

 Steven Drukman is writing a history of avant-garde theater in
America.  
 By STEVEN DRUKMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some changes come more easily than others. In 1979,
when a bunch of scrappy performance artists transformed an
abandoned public school in the East Village into a showcase for
experimental dance and theater, they didn't even have to change the
name. P.S. 122 (now Performance Space 122) stood as a vast
ready-made home for the city's burgeoning performance-art
community.
</P>
<P>
   Then another change occurred: through the 1980s and '90s, the
neighborhood surrounding the red brick building on First Avenue and
Ninth Street was gentrified. P.S. 122 was transformed from a rental
house with a $40,000 annual budget into a producing organization
with an $800,000 annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, it has presented more than 5,000 artists and
commissioned hundreds of new plays and dance works. Increased
financial support, critical accolades from the mainstream press,
and an audience that grew more discerning as it increased (the
mailing list now exceeds 13,000) all combined to turn P.S. 122 into
what its longtime executive director, Mark Russell, calls ``the
Carnegie Hall of performance art.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Russell, who programs more than 150 performances every
year, faces a new challenge: How to keep P.S. 122 cutting-edge by
presenting emerging talent while also providing space to the
established artists who came of age with some of the audience. And
how to do it in a climate of diminished state and federal support
as well as increased competition from younger theaters, like the
Here Arts Center in SoHo, theaters very much like P.S. 122 in its
infancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have a new job this year,'' said the soft-spoken
Russell recently. ``We are now high enough on the food chain of
presenters so that I have to make difficult choices. I have to
worry about putting people in seats, but P.S. 122 must always be a
shelter for some bohemia. And still, I want to keep this a home for
our masters. The hardest part of my job is to say to artists who
have performed here for years, `That piece may work better
somewhere else.'''
</P>
<P>
   The roster of those who have appeared at P.S. 122 while
developing into major arts figures reads like a Who's Who of the
experimental dance and theater scene. Eric Bogosian, Meredith Monk
and Spalding Gray are a small sample of those who have presented
new work.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of these artists, aging along with the institution,
are part of what would once have been a contradiction in terms: the
mainstream avant-garde. Gray, an original member of the
experimental Wooster Group, has become known to wider audiences
through his one-man shows and appearances in mainstream films.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he frequently returns to test new material at P.S. 122,
as he did last fall in his solo show ``Morning, Noon and Night.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogosian's 1982 ``Fun House'' was the first work of many that
went on from development at P.S. 122 to a full-scale commercial
run. ``P.S. 122 has never been and never will be a place that
exists only to move a production,'' Bogosian said. ``You can make
theater for show biz, for a paycheck, or, like at P.S. 122, for
love and joy.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, honestly, it can be a little ramshackle. But that's
part of the experience: it's casual and excited. Audiences don't
sit there, shoved in their seats by an angry usher, arms crossed,
thinking, `O.K., now show me something.' They want to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bogosian, who, like Russell, is 44, added: ``As far as
cutting edge, I actually think that idea has been abandoned over
the years, in a good way. Maybe I reflect their new audience, as
someone who goes out less because I have two small kids now, and so
I want to see something good. But Mark Russell knows that, and so
taste supersedes shock value.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in the vast 3,000-square-foot space that makes up the
larger of his two theaters, Russell wears the downtown
establishment look: a goatee and earrings in both ears, but
conservative preppy clothing. ``Sometimes I feel like the hunchback
of P.S. 122,'' he confessed. ``Much of my job is telling newer
artists who consider this their P.S. 122 about the history,
teaching them what other artists here learned before them. Like,
yeah, I know, blood looks really good on naked bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of P.S. 122 has also been recorded in two recent
books. ``Out of Character: Rants, Raves and Monologues From Today's
Top Performance Artists'' was edited by Russell, who has been
running P.S. 122 since 1983. It contains the texts of solo shows,
many performed at the former school by, among others, Karen Finley,
Penny Arcade, Ron Athey, David Cale and Deb Margolin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Caught in the Act'' is a collection of photographs, mostly of
P.S. 122 performances, by Dona Ann McAdams, whom Russell calls
``P.S. 122's house photographer.''
</P>
<P>
   The original founders were three performance artists _ Tim
Miller, Charles Dennis and Peter Rose _ and a choreographer,
Charles Moulton. ``For me,'' Miller recalled, ``it was the ultimate
treehouse. There was a real `I'll show you mine, if you show me
yours' buzz about the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that Russell had been ``immersed in the deep psychic
and creative juices of the enterprise'' from the beginning, and
seemed to be the most likely candidate to run the business side.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Russell insisted otherwise: ``I was just hanging out!
Because I sold magazine ads to downtown arts organizations, people
assumed I had business know-how. So in March of '83, when they
asked me to become executive director, I just said yes. When I came
on the job, if a performer had 100 bucks for rent, we'd show him
where the clip lamps were, maybe make a poster and do a mailing,
and that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, five separate groups formed the 122 Community Center
to take over the building. Russell sits on the board with his
group, Performance Space 122, along with Painting Space 122, the
Children's Liberation Day Care Center, Mabou Mines (the avant-garde
theater company) and the AIDS Service Center.
</P>
<P>
   The groups divide responsibilities for maintenance and pay $1 in
annual rent to the city. Russell supervises a full-time staff of
seven and several part-time box office assistants and ushers.
</P>
<P>
   He tends to draw distinctions between P.S. 122 and other similar
long-lived institutions like La Mama E.T.C. and the Kitchen with
care: ``I see us as not competing _ our audiences now often overlap
_ but having different ecologies. Dance Theater Workshop and
Danspace have more of a dance agenda. We started as a reaction to
places like the Kitchen and Franklin Furnace. Our guys couldn't get
gigs there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Wilson, the founder of Franklin Furnace in 1976, said she
considered the P.S. 122 crowd the next generation. In addition,
``They really came from a different tradition,'' she said.
``Whereas we were more of the European avant-garde _ we would
present an artist fasting for 40 days, for example _ P.S. 122 was
always more in the theater world, with a beginning, middle and end.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Franklin Furnace is concept-based and not overly
concerned with audience, P.S. 122 is solicitous of its audience.
And Mark Russell's success has been to broaden that audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he believed each generation had its own
avant-garde: ``There will always be artists who are trying things.
Sometimes they gravitate toward dance, or performance art, or
theater, or the installation world, or they combine those forms to
bring out what they want to say to their time. People who want to
make their statement are attracted to New York, so there is a
steady source. Sometimes it's hard to pick up what they're talking
about. But it usually becomes clear through one or two voices what
the new concerns are and where it's going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the luxury of the major transgressions of
theater in form and content that the past did. So we are down to
the fine-tuning of the avant-garde. It's hard to shock people or to
turn their eyes to something new, to take an experience like going
to the theater or a subject like sex and make it fresh for them.
And I think those are the concerns of the avant-garde: to find what
is real, to find the truth in the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell characterized the show ``Thwak,'' by David Collins and
Shane Dundas, two Australians who call themselves the Umbilical
Brothers and do physical and verbal comedy, as ``one that got
away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they are getting a commercial run at the Minetta Lane
Theater,'' he said. ``They are definitely the kind of show we might
have presented. I'm interested in works that push their genre and
are very original. These two guys are.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best things I found recently,'' he continued, ``I
saw at 11:30 on a Tuesday night _ way past my bedtime _ at Baby
Jupiter, a bar and restaurant on Stanton Street. The artist's name
is Akim Funk Buddha, from Zimbabwe, and the show is called `Da
Fusion.'
</P>
<P>
   It involves tap-dancing, break-dancing, mask work, puppetry and
a 20-piece band that includes sitars, zithers, a theramin and kodo
drums.'' Russell said the show would be presented at P.S. 122 in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the last time he was at P.S. 122, Richard Schechner,
the experimental director and a professor of performance studies at
New York University, said: ``I saw Spalding Gray try out his new
piece there. It was an excellent evening and valuable to Gray, who
thinks of P.S. 122 as a supportive environment for developing new
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask about the avant-garde. What avant-garde? In advance
of what garde? In today's multiplex performance world _ a zillion
channels from cable through the Internet and a few dozen places for
live performance _ P.S. 122 has its niche somewhere to the left of
the Kitchen. As for relevance, the question is: To whom, for what?
In general, the more that smaller spaces allow elbow room for
artists, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said he looked ``for a spark with new talent, but
sometimes it takes a few tries to throw something up against the
wall before anything sticks.'' Open year round, often with four
different events per evening, P.S. 122 offers an array of artistic
activity with widely varying artistic payoffs. With money from the
Jerome Foundation, the New York State Council on the Arts and the
Van Lier Fund, Russell commissions 10 to 20 new works a year and
said he begged foreign governments to fly him abroad to see
emerging international talent.
</P>
<P>
   First-timers may perform at P.S. 122 for one night as part of a
larger series, at no admission price. But last year's solo show by
Danny Hoch, ``Jails, Hospitals and Hip-Hop'' (produced commercially
at the building in association with P.S. 122) had such wide appeal
that it played to sold-out houses for 14 weeks, with tickets priced
up to the theater's limit of $25. (Hoch is making a return
appearance in the show from May 27 through June 7.)

 Exchange After Tech Alliance
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The Pacific Exchange is close to inking a joint-venture deal with
New York broker Cantor Fitzgerald to start a computer-based stock
options trading system, people familiar with the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   The venture is key to the exchange's strategy for staying
competitive as the options business goes electronic. An agreement
could be announced within a few weeks, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor approached Pacific, the No. 3 U.S. options exchange, in
January shortly after the Chicago Board Options Exchange, the
nation's largest options exchange, pulled out of its deal to merge
with San Francisco's bourse.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific and Cantor confirmed talks have taken place, but they
declined to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had discussions with Cantor about a potential
strategic alliance,'' said Pacific spokesman Dale Carlson. ``We've
had lots of discussions with lots of parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacific previously approached the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, a
technologically advanced options exchange, about a possible
alliance but chose to focus on Cantor, sources said. A CME
spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Options are contracts that give holders the right to buy or sell
stocks at preset prices before a fixed date. Exchanges trade
options wholesale for brokers who in turn buy or sell them for
retail or institutional customers.
</P>
<P>
   A possible Pacific-Cantor deal comes as traditional options
exchanges around the world rush out electronic trading systems to
replace or operate alongside their old-fashioned trading floors.
Under the traditional system, called open outcry, options contracts
are traded by frantic brokers shouting out offers to buy or sell.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional exchanges are threatened by computer-based
competitors, including the soon-to-be-launched International
Securities Exchange backed by Palo Alto online broker E-Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific is especially vulnerable following the collapse of its
CBOE merger since it lacks the funds to buy an advanced computer
trading system. Exchange officials have said a joint venture is the
best way to get access to the technology they need.
</P>
<P>
   The plan Cantor and the San Francisco exchange are negotiating
would allocate some options to their joint electronic system while
keeping others on Pacific's trading floor in the Mills Building on
Montgomery Street, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is a future for both open outcry and
screen-based trading,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, observers said, if customers find that electronic trading
is cheaper and more efficient, all exchanges, including Pacific,
could eventually be forced to close their options trading floors.
Pacific has already said it plans to adopt an all-electronic system
in its stock exchange business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been predicting the end of open outcry for 10 years,
though the change has been slower than I thought,'' said Steven
Manaster, director of Virginia Tech University's Financial Risk
Management Center.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with Pacific's operations estimated there is
just a 10 percent chance the exchange's options floor will still be
open in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Cantor operates the world's largest electronic brokerage system
for bonds and other debt securities.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it formed a partnership with the New York Board of
Trade, a commodities exchange, to start an all-electronic exchange
for specialized trading vehicles called financial futures.
</P>
<P>
   The Cantor Exchange, as the joint venture is known, was the
first federally regulated exchange operated by a private brokerage.
Most exchanges, including Pacific, are membership associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant thing we bring to any potential alliance
is the ability for an electronic business to be up and running
instantly,'' said Cantor managing director Debra Walton.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Cantor would get a large flow of business
channeled to its exchange. Last year, Pacific traded about 275,000
options contracts a day.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing which options would be traded electronically and which
would stay on Pacific's trading floor is a key issue in talks.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Cantor Exchange often trades less than 1,000
futures contracts a day because it hasn't achieved the critical
mass to make it competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific's Carlson declined to comment on whether an alliance
would have to be approved by the exchange's members.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by embracing new technology, the exchange injures the
careers of its members, they have a problem,'' said Virginia Tech's
Manaster. ``The members are unlikely to support the plan unless
they are compensated with some piece of the action.''

 NEW YORK: June 7.)  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Now, unfortunately, I can't commission a work from Danny Hoch
because, God help him, he's become a popular sensation,'' Russell
said. ``But I have no bitterness when these guys move on. I'm proud
that John Leguizamo developed parts of his show `Freak' here and
then went on to be nominated for a Tony Award on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those mainstream artists nourish P.S. 122 in other ways.
We wouldn't have air-conditioning upstairs if it weren't for Danny
Hoch. And Eric Bogosian did a $10,000 benefit for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Russell said that the biggest corporate donor is Blue
Man Group, a troupe that appeared at P.S. 122 in 1989 and went on
to an Off Broadway commercial engagement in 1991 at the Astor Place
Theater that is still running.
</P>
<P>
   While Russell said he had observed a transformation over the
years in the audience at his institution, it is still an audience
interested in what is new. ``Sure, they want a subway line near the
theater,'' he said, ``and they want comfortable seats. Not that
they're not hungry for an adventure _ they just want the cream of
the adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the audience as ``pretty young, with a majority
in their mid-20s to mid-30s.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the program,'' he said, ``we always have many
different areas of the city represented: a lot of people from the
Bronx and Harlem as well as from here in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe as the elder gentleman,'' he added with a smile, ``I can
be just the right screen for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Russell was born in Menomonee, Wis., but spent much of his
childhood in Austin, Texas. After graduating from the University of
Texas, he went to Poland in the summer of 1977 and studied with the
experimental directors Jerzy Grotowski and Tadeusz Kantor.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to New York, he said, his taste for the avant-garde
was well formed, but: ``I had no illusions about being an artist
working in New York. I trained in school as a director, but being a
presenter really suits my pH balance. I like every aspect of
producing, from concept to posters.'' He lives on the edge of
Chinatown with Sarah Skaggs, a choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   His institution, Russell believes, led a charmed life in the
1980s. But the political climate was changing and in 1990, the
National Endowment for the Arts revoked grants for the solo artists
Holly Hughes, John Fleck and Ms. Finley and Miller.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a number of artists and organizations refused NEA
grant money because they were unwilling to sign a pledge not to use
the funds to produce work that in the judgment of the NEA might be
considered obscene.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Kitchen and Franklin Furnace, P.S. 122 went
unmentioned in congressional testimony as a presenter of high-risk
performance art. Russell speculated that because P.S. 122 sounded
like a school, it evaded notice. Still, it has not received NEA
money for three years, though there has been recent word that a
possible $75,000 grant may be in the offing earmarked for
improvements to the organization's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``But until I see the check, I'm not getting money from the
NEA,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of consistent federal support has changed things.
``Now, 50 percent of my budget comes from box office, and it used
to be 10 to 20 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such challenges, Russell has no plans to move on. ``It
helps to have an active board of directors, many of whom are
artists,'' he said. ``Sure, we have the usual lawyers and
accountants, but our board president, Lucy Sexton, is a member of
Dancenoise,'' a duo who perform frequently at P.S. 122, and are
known for presenting outrageous dance works. ``It's nice to see
your board president once a year, naked and covered in blood.''

 VC Firms Put Wads of Cash Into Internet Companies
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Internet companies, including equipment and access providers and
online retailers, snared a record amount of venture capital
financing in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, VCs poured $2.1 billion into fast-growing
Internet companies in the quarter ended March 31, according to
VentureOne Corp., a San Francisco research firm. That was nearly a
third more than the previous quarter and represented a whopping 58
percent of the record $3.6 billion that flowed to 464 U.S.
venture-backed companies from January &LR;   &LR; through March.
</P>
<P>
   And as a sign that San Francisco is as much the center of the
online universe as anywhere else, five of the 10 U.S. companies
that received the most venture capital financing in the first
quarter of 1999 are based in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California, a similar percentage of funds invested
by VC firms and their institutional partners went to Internet
startups in the past quarter: $1 billion out of $1.7 billion. By
contrast, VC investments in all local companies in the same quarter
a year earlier totaled just $806 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extraordinary volume of Internet investments turned a
normally slow quarter into a record breaker,'' said Rolf Selvig,
VentureOne's director of business development. Unlike the biotech
and semiconductor industries, he noted, ``The Internet is an area
where you can build a successful company in a short period of time
and not have to wait for FDA approval or build a huge fab plant.''
</P>
<P>
   That means venture capital investors can recoup their
investments in Internet companies a lot faster than they might in
other types of investments.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the time it takes to develop and finance an Internet
idea is getting so compressed that several companies announced
plans to go public in the same quarter they received their final
infusion from VC firms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, NorthPoint Communications, a San Francisco provider
of high-speed Internet access services, won $63.6 million from VCs
in February. The firm announced plans the following month to raise
$125 million in an IPO, which it launched last week and netted
nearly $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   The top local venture deals in the past quarter also included
these companies:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ LookSmart &LR; . The Internet's largest directory of reviewed Web
sites raised $60 million. The company, headquartered in Multimedia
Gulch at Bryant and Third streets, has about 350 employees with
nearly half of them researching and writing about Web sites.
LookSmart provides its directory of more than 750,000 sites in some
30,000 categories to more than 4.5 million Internet service
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Patricia Cole said that the company is
considering a public stock offering. ``If you do acquisitions, it's
nice to have a currency that people understand,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Digital Island.  &LR; Another San Francisco company that offers
companies Web network services, the firm raised $50 million in the
first quarter and then raised $75 million more in an IPO two weeks
ago. The 5-year-old company leases dedicated telecommunications
circuits to provide faster online connections and other Web
services for companies such as E-Trade and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ WineShopper.com &LR; . The online wine emporium received $46
million in VC commitments, including $35 million in the past
quarter, according to VentureOne.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other services that may run afoul of complicated and
cumbersome laws that ban direct shipment of alcoholic beverages
from producer to retailer or end-user, WineShopper.com works within
the existing three-tier system of producers, wholesale distributors
and retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   The company has received financial backing from blue-chip VC
firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers and support from the Wine and
Spirits Wholesalers Association. WineShopper.com is the brainchild
of Peter Sisson, who has a master's degree in computer science from
Stanford, an MBA from Tuck and until a year ago was a
telecommunications analyst at Montgomery Securities.
</P>
<P>
   CEO Sisson expects his e-commerce service, which will be
launched later this year, will make it as easy for the consumer to
buy a broad selection of wines as it is to buy books on Amazon.com.
That ease of use is the result of a very intricate system for using
the existing patchwork quilt of wholesale and retail distribution
channels in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Total Entertainment Network &LR; . The San Francisco online game
company, raised $30 million. The 60-employee startup, which has 2
million registered members, has shifted its focus from pay-to-play
games like Duke Nuke 'Em to classic and family games like cards,
crossword puzzle and bingo where it picks up money from
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Other local companies.  &LR; Several e-commerce and online
information companies received $25 million each in the past
quarter. They include Ask Jeeves, the question-answering service
that announced plans on April 30 for an IPO; E-greetings, an online
greeting card company; Food.com, the Internet's largest food
takeout and delivery service; and PlanetRX, an online provider of
pharmaceutical and other drug store products.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 167 Northern California companies received venture
capital financing in the past quarter. That compares with 158
companies in the previous quarter and 128 companies in the first
three months of last year.
</P>
<P>
   VentureOne also reports that 22 venture-backed companies in the
United States went public in the first quarter, raising $1.5
billion. Local IPOs included Covad Communications of Santa Clara,
Critical Path of San Francisco, Autoweb.com of Santa Clara and
Intraware of Orinda.
</P>

A MAN WHO TRADED EVERYTHING FOR AN INDIAN TROVE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Maine, Mass.)  (af) 
 By RITA REIF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   At 15, Frank T. Siebert Jr. became so frustrated at not finding
the books he wanted to read on American Indians and the Western
frontier in school or at the public libraries in Philadelphia that
he began collecting. His first purchase, a 1904 reprint of John
Eliot's ``Logick Primer,'' from 1672, cost 28 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 70 years, he became a pathologist, sold his blood
to buy books, got married, then left his wife and children and
lived for a while in his car. He sometimes paid dearly for the
works he relentlessly tracked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Siebert's story bears every mark of the fanatic
collector,'' said the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who first
met Siebert in the late 1930s, when both were students at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``To buy books, he sacrificed everything, but there was this
other side of him: he is one of the major authorities in American
Indian languages, a genius who devoted his life to this study. His
eminence in this field is totally unquestioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Siebert focused mostly on the language and legends of various
tribes, especially the Catawbas of South Carolina and the
Penoboscot of Maine. And for the last 30 years of his life he lived
alone in Old Town, Maine, among the Penoboscot, mastering their
language and becoming its last speaker. He produced a dictionary of
it. He amassed 1,500 books and manuscripts, which filled most of
the walls of his cottage.
</P>
<P>
   At his death at 85 from cancer a year ago, Siebert's collection
had never been seen by his colleagues in anthropology and
linguistics, by the dealers and collectors from whom he bought
books or by his two daughters, with whom he was reconciled a decade
ago. They paid him several visits, exchanged letters with him and
spoke to him on the telephone, which he had installed toward the
end of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister and I ended up caring about him, proud to have a
father who was so unusual,'' said Stephanie M. Finger, his younger
daughter. ``He thought he was indestructible, would live forever
and keep the collection forever.''
</P>
<P>
   At Siebert's direction just before he died, Stephanie and her
sister, Kathleen L. Davis, called in Bailey Bishop, the Cambridge,
Mass., dealer from whom he had bought most of his books since the
mid-60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hounded me in his 50-year search for the famous Cherokee
Spelling Book, from 1819,'' Bishop said. ``It was the first book
printed in that language, and only two copies survive.'' Bishop
inventoried the collection and sent it to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Siebert library will be auctioned in two parts at
Sotheby's, in Manhattan, in a sale estimated to total about $7
million. The first 550 books, which focus on the tribes east of the
Mississippi, will go on view Sunday and be offered for sale on
Friday; they are expected to bring as much as $3.4 million. The
rest of the books, on those of the South and the West, will be
auctioned in October.
</P>
<P>
   Among the prizes in the sale is a copy of the first Bible
printed in America, a two-volume translation by John Eliot, who was
known as ``the apostle to the Indians,'' into the Natick-Algonquin
language. It was published in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in
1661-1663. Sotheby's expects that it will fetch as much as
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even among the lesser works that Siebert bought were gems,
including a fine 1828 copy of ``Sketches of Ancient History in the
Six Nations,'' by David Cusick, an artist of New York's Tuscarora
tribe. Produced to be sold as a souvenir at Niagara Falls, the book
has pages that are still uncut, and the images on the distinctive
fold-out frontispiece are drawn from Tuscarora legends.
</P>
<P>
   One depicts a treelike monster leering through foliage at a
woman eating roasted acorns, which he mistakes for burning coals;
another shows two giants, covered with sand head to foot, being
chased by a god transformed into an even larger giant. Two other
images are of an Indian chief and his dog and a war dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all other copies I've seen, the tail of the dog in one
image and the head of the drummer in another are torn off,''
Carpenter said. ``Trust Siebert to get the right one.''
</P>
<P>
   Siebert's curiosity about Indian languages prompted him to buy a
letter that George Washington sent to an Indian agent in 1786. In
it Washington relayed a request from Catherine the Great, made
through the Marquis de Lafayette, for authentic documents about
American Indian vocabularies that she wanted for the dictionary she
was working on. (It was never published.) The letter may sell for
up to $26,000.
</P>
<P>
   The 1681 Indian deed ceding all the land of what is now Jamaica,
Queens, to the British for 15 coats, 9 kettles, 5 guns, 2 blankets,
2 pairs of stockings and a pair of shoes may bring up to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Siebert's costliest items will be offered at the fall
sale. An 1843 travel book of North America by the German Prince
Maximilian Alexander Philipp, lavishly illustrated with lithographs
of Indians based on Karl Bodmer's drawings, may sell for as much as
$200,000.
</P>
<P>
   And a rare American edition of George Catlin's most famous work,
the 1845 portfolio of Indians and hunting scenes, may bring up to
$120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressive stuff,'' Carpenter said. ``He put his money where
his heart was and was a true scholar. The fact that he didn't take
his doctorate in anthropology, forget it. He was ahead of a whole
crowd of professionals.''

CISCO SYSTEMS CITES 33 PERCENT EARNINGS GAIN FOR QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems Inc. beat analysts' third-quarter
earnings estimates by 1 cent per share, as the company continued
its robust growth.
</P>
<P>
   The leading maker of specialized hardware for computer networks
attributed its strong results to the rapid expansion of the
Internet. Cisco reported its results after the close of the regular
market trading, but earlier shares of Cisco closed at $111.875, up
$2.625, in NASDAQ trading. The shares jumped as high as $115.25 in
after-hours trading, according to Instinet.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Cisco may be the leading beneficiary of Internet
growth. Nothing is so ubiquitous on the Internet as Cisco's
routers, specialized computers that manage data traffic on a
network using the Internet Protocol, known as IP. More than 80
percent of the routers connected to the Internet are Cisco
machines. Whether any of the new Internet ventures succeed or not,
the greater the traffic on the network, the more Cisco routers are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   But from primarily selling routers to corporations to manage
internal data, Cisco has shifted its emphasis to major telephone
service providers, to whom it offers a vision of multiple services
over their networks. Sales to telecommunication service providers
rose more than 70 percent from a year ago, and now contribute about
a third of Cisco's revenue, Cisco executives told analysts on a
conference call.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended May 1, Cisco reported earnings of $646
million, or 38 cents per diluted share, up 33 percent from $484
million, or 30 cents a share in the period a year ago. Sales rose
44 percent, to $3.15 billion, from $2.18 billion for the third
quarter. The year-ago earnings are a pro-forma number that has been
adjusted to eliminate one-time charges of $419 million for the
write-off of research and development it acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Cisco to earn 37 cents a share, according to
First Call.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts after the earnings were
announced, Cisco warned that said gross margins would fall in the
next few quarters.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Cisco announced it will acquire Geotel
Communications and Amteva Technologies. Both acquisitions bring
advanced voice capabilities to Cisco's technology portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco also announced a 2-for-1 stock split May 24. The split,
the eighth since Cisco went public in 1990, will take effect June
21. Two-for-one stock splits occurred in 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994 and
1996; and a three-for-two split occurred in 1997 and 1998.

 NorthPoint founder stays grounded
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
When NorthPoint Communications founder and CEO Michael Malaga
raised $63.6 million in venture financing last February, he thought
his Internet access service company wouldn't need a public stock
offering until this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed after his major competitors _ Covad
Communications of Santa Clara and Rhythms Netconnections of
Colorado _ raised a combined $290 million in wildly successful
IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   NorthPoint opted to step up &LR;   &LR; its timetable to take advantage of
investors' seemingly insatiable appetite for anything Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, it sold 17.25 million shares at $24 each. By the
end of the day, with the stock trading up 68 percent at $40.25,
NorthPoint suddenly was worth nearly $5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That's not bad for a company that lost $28.8 million on $931,000
in sales last year and last month had about 3,500 business users
paying an average $130 a month for its services. To put
NorthPoint's financial feat in perspective, the company would now
displace newspaper publisher Knight Ridder Inc. in the 39th spot on
last month's Chronicle 500 ranking of local public companies. It
trails Apple Computer in &UR;  &LR; value by a mere 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the important thing to investors is that NorthPoint
is well positioned in the multibillion-dollar market for faster
Internet connection services.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco company sells online access through
conventional copper phone lines that is at least 25 times faster
than conventional dial-up modems. Its digital subscriber line (DSL)
service is available to businesses through Internet service
providers in 17 major markets and will be expanded to another 11
areas by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Malaga, 34, overnight became worth $300 million (at least on
paper). But he is not letting NorthPoint's instant stardom on Wall
Street divert his attention. He plans to continue taking the bus to
work, although the firm's headquarters will soon move from four
overcrowded floors above Loehmann's on Sutter Street to six floors
and major tenant status in the former Chevron headquarters building
at 225 Bush St.
</P>
<P>
   Like many entrepreneurs, Malaga is more interested in applied
than theoretical science, or what he calls ``things that work for
people.'' After studying applied physics at Cornell and getting a
master's degree in structural dynamics at the University of
Cincinnati, he worked for Lucas Nova Sensor, which made chips for
automobile air bags.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, he worked for a Silicon Valley company that
made software to help engineers measure vibration and noise in
cars, planes and disk drives. Then he sought a job at
telecommunications innovator MFS Communications, where he led
strategic development efforts, including high-speed Internet
connections using copper phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Malaga founded NorthPoint two years ago with five other former
MFS executives who fled after the company was acquired by WorldCom
and focused increasingly on voice rather than data delivery.
</P>
<P>
   NorthPoint started in Malaga's studio apartment and was named
after the street where he lives. After developing ``the initial
recipes'' (with a co-founder sleeping on his couch), Malaga said
the next step was ``raising money to fund them.''
</P>
<P>
   Although good planning was crucial, serendipity helped. Malaga
met venture capitalist Peter Wagner of Accel Partners at a
breakfast meeting. By chance, Accel had invested in related
telecommunications equipment startups and was looking for a company
like NorthPoint. Within weeks, Malaga had a handshake on the first
$3.5 million of venture backing.
</P>
<P>
   NorthPoint chose to locate in the heart of San Francisco's
financial and retail district partly because of access to public
transportation. It also chose to make downtown its first test
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to show investment partners you can execute
your plan _ like proving the dogs will eat the dog food,'' said
Malaga. NorthPoint first served local businesses through Internet
service providers Brainstorm and Concentric Networks in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then it pushed to expand to other places, starting with Silicon
Valley in early 1998. It also forged strategic relationships with
Microsoft, Intel and other high-tech giants along with more than 85
online connection companies.
</P>
<P>
   After growing from 50 to 500 employees, NorthPoint brought in
Pacific Bell and US West veteran Liz Fetter as president and chief
operating officer two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, talk and raise money,'' joked Malaga. ``She runs the
operating lines of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaga says adaptability is one of the essential attributes of
successful entrepreneurs. Most recently that translated into
speeding up the IPO because the the public equity market has become
a cheaper source of capital than the $229 &UR;  &LR; million the company
raised in the private debt and private equity markets. In its IPO,
NorthPoint netted $388 million by selling an 11 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner of Accel Partners said one reason companies like
NorthPoint are raising so much venture money is that they want to
make sure they have sufficient funds to operate if the IPO market
cools. Success increasingly depends on the ability to expand
rapidly, he explained. ``It's risky for companies to slow down and
give their competitors a chance to overtake them.''

CAUTIONARY TALES OF WISDOM IN FEROCIOUS FORMS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Kay Larson is an art critic who practices Zen.  
 By KAY LARSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From a nose-length away, Robert Thurman is
scrutinizing the three glaring bull's-eyes and two fire-spouting
horns of a fierce Tibetan deity. A row of skulls parades across the
creature's blue-black head. Roaring red flames wreathe its body.
</P>
<P>
   But Thurman points to a peaceful face on the creature's
headdress: Manjushri, representing sublime cosmic wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manjushri has adopted this ferocious form,'' Thurman says,
``to subdue this guy'' _ he points to a small black demon at the
bottom of the picture _ ``Yama, the god of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, leading a visitor through the exhibition ``Worlds of
Transformation: Tibetan Art of Wisdom and Compassion,'' at Tibet
House in Chelsea, sees in this cautionary tale a message about the
way to tame the violence in the human mind. Still seared by images
from Littleton, Colo., and Kosovo, he ponders the human capacity
for delusion.
</P>
<P>
   How do you take the mind's penchant for evil and turn it into
wisdom?
</P>
<P>
   Yamantaka, the bullish protector, brings Yama, the god of death,
to heel, says Thurman, by scaring him silly: ``He puts death
through death'' by revealing the interconnectedness of all things.
Thurman continues: ``In Colorado, they were running around trying
to act like Yama, annihilating people. Whereas what Yamantaka would
have showed them is that the horrible things they were doing will
only get more horrible when they die.''
</P>
<P>
   He describes a meditation Tibetans use: `` `Come, Yamantaka,
destroy my killer heart,' meaning my self-centered egocentric
narcissism.''
</P>
<P>
   Insights like these into the formerly closed world of Tibetan
art are one reason the high-wattage Thurman, who is professor of
Indo-Tibetan Buddhist Studies at Columbia University and a
co-founder of Tibet House, has become the foremost Western
spokesman for Tibetan culture (although in some circles he is more
famous as the father of Uma).
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition he has organized with Marylin M. Rhie
exhaustively analyzes 200 Tibetan paintings from the 15th century
onward, taking up where the pair's 1991 exhibition, ``Wisdom and
Compassion,'' left off. ``Wisdom and Compassion,'' which is still
touring the world, offered the first significant look at what
seemed at the time to be a mysteriously opaque art form.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Worlds of Transformation,'' the doors open a little wider.
The catalog is two-thirds the size of a Manhattan phone book and
clearly reflects the expansion of knowledge about Tibet in the
West, as well as suggesting the vastness of Thurman's mental data
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The first Westerner to be ordained in Tibetan Buddhism, and a
friend of the Dalai Lama, Thurman has a personal stake in the quest
for inner liberation. He describes his own journey in two recent
books, ``Inner Revolution'' (Riverhead Books) and ``Circling the
Sacred Mountain'' (Bantam).
</P>
<P>
   Excavating the mind, Tibetans have found terrifying things. This
horrific imagery is enlisted to show people how to deal with
darkness. ``The fierce deities are the powers of nature transmuted
into helpful forces for the teaching of enlightenment,'' Thurman
says. ``Wisdom is not just some hopeful wishful thinking that the
world is nice. Wisdom is able to confront the seemingly most
negative thing in the world and see through that and find the
positive possibility even in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan deities are flickering, shape-changing beings able to
take whatever form best serves to open people's eyes. They can
choose to emanate what Thurman calls ``supernova flames, world-end
flames _ like nuclear fission, really hot.'' But when they're not
being wrathful, they show a composed and compassionate face.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the scary material, the show includes pictures of
peaceful, vibrant, serenely blissful beings floating in what seems
like a virtual reality of radiating light and electric red, blue
and yellow auras. Some of these figures are humans _ saints,
monastics and arhats (sages) _ who successfully applied these
alchemical transformations to themselves, converting their own
delusions into wisdom and compassion.
</P>
<P>
   But Thurman, pausing before one particularly gory flaying scene,
admits that Tibetan art has been nearly swamped by New Age
misinformation. ``Because of the subconscious stuff, the violent
and erotic imagery,'' he says, ``people have used that already to
give a wrong idea about Tibetan tantra.'' The Dalai Lama, he says,
has decided to speak openly about tantric rituals to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   Assembling this show, Thurman and Ms. Rhie had the pick of some
1,000 paintings acquired over the last 15 years by Donald Rubin,
who owns a managed-care company in New York, and his wife, Shelley.
Rubin, speaking from his art-filled Fifth Avenue offices, says he
was drawn to Tibetan imagery precisely because it addresses the
dual nature of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For him, the issue is not academic. ``My father's whole family
was killed by the Nazis,'' he says. ``I was living in New York when
it was happening, and I was aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He observes that violence is not confined by any borders:
``Wilhelm Reich wrote that we all have a Nazi in us. It is getting
a handle on that Nazi in us that is the important thing. By
realizing it's there you can control it. Awareness is the first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin says he has purchased a building in Manhattan and is in
the early stages of converting it into a museum for Tibetan and
other art that addresses the mind's mythic archetypes. He and his
foundation have also sponsored a Web site (tibetart.com) allowing
scholars and concerned advocates like Thurman to compare paintings
still in Tibet _ those that haven't yet been ripped from temples
and private shrines _ to those that have arrived in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan art has been victimized by the very anarchic forces it
invokes. Paintings began showing up in quantity in the West after
the Chinese invasion in the 1950s. When the Dalai Lama escaped in
1959, he carried on his back a tantric painting (of the
destroyer-goddess Penden Lhamo, the Tibetan form of Kali, mother of
the world) that only Dalai Lamas are allowed to view.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetans fleeing to India in the early '60s packed out
paintings, which often ended up in curio shops in Katmandu, New
Delhi, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   By Thurman's estimate, the Chinese have destroyed 90 percent of
Tibet's art. Of the remainder, he says, about 2 percent to 3
percent is safe in Western collections, while another 2 percent to
3 percent remains vulnerable in Tibetan temples. The rest, roughly
5 percent, is floating in the world's art markets.
</P>
<P>
   Now that prices have risen tenfold or so, secular Tibetans and
Chinese officers have been slipping paintings into the black
market. That is preferable, in Thurman's view, to the burning and
shredding that was commonplace even in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetans were originally warriors, no less inherently violent
than anyone else. ``A thousand years ago the Tibetans were very
frightening, a Gengis Khan-type people,'' Thurman says. ``They
conquered the silk route, they beat up the Arabs, they destroyed
the Chinese a few times. They were a very fierce predatory country.
But then they became completely peaceful. They ceased their own
ways of being conquerors and killers, and they stopped harassing
their neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   He points to a red female deity poised gracefully on one foot at
the center of a six-sided star: Vajravarahi, the Diamond Sow, one
of the erotic manifestations. Thurman lists her attributes: She is
naked because there is no barrier between her and reality. Holding
a skull bowl filled with demon blood elixir, waving a garland of
freshly severed heads, she dances on a corpse _ male _ that
symbolizes ignorance conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to give Gloria Steinem any ideas,'' Thurman
says, laughing. ``She is both male and female. Her female side is
wisdom, her male side is compassion. She's totally in balance and
knows what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Having faced down and passed through the terrors of the self,
Thurman says, Vajravarahi has found ``erotic, ecstatic oneness with
reality.'' He continues: ``It's total ecstatic freedom and bliss.
You remain balanced and aware of the infinite interconnectedness of
things. You're released from the stress of having to hold anything
separate from reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating wisdom, the Diamond Sow dances. Thurman wonders:
Will the world ever dance with her?

   SOFIA, Bulgaria _ For Yugoslavia's Balkan and Central European
neighbors, the war in Kosovo is becoming part of a familiar pattern
of casting their lot with the perceived victor.
</P>
<P>
   As Europe's first hot war in half a century damages their
economies and public anxiety over the conflict mounts, governments
in this region have made a kind of wager that the future after the
guns fall silent will be promising only if they find themselves on
NATO's side.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other nations ringing Yugoslavia, Bulgaria has taken
this course _ even as NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia and Danube
bridges cuts this Balkan country of more than 8 million people from
its markets in western Europe and its meager export income
plummets. Prospects for foreign investment, crucial for future
recovery, have dimmed, and nipped a brief economic springtime in
the bud.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last week, the military risks of a shared border with
Yugoslavia were brought home to Bulgarians, when a NATO missile
tore into the attic of a home of a family of four on the outskirts
of Sofia. It was the fourth NATO missile to hit Bulgarian soil. No
one has been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, despite all these events, a broad majority of
Bulgaria's parliament voted last Tuesday, after only five hours of
debate, to make the country the latest in the region to open its
air space for NATO bombing missions, in exchange for security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was very much in line with the policies of the
anti-Communist, pro-business government that took office in 1997 to
rescue Bulgaria from economic collapse. Unlike its neo-Communist
predecessor, this government and reformist President Petar
Stoyanov, elected in 1996, have pushed Bulgaria toward NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the alliance now is ``a question of Euro-Atlantic
solidarity, and choosing European values,'' Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A failure by NATO in Kosovo, he added, would ``give the right to
any government to commit genocide against its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kostov's arguments echoed those of government leaders lined up
against Yugoslavia and President Slobodan Milosevic, across the
region where Communism once held sway.
</P>
<P>
   But the moral stance, opposing evil with good, masks a far more
complex reality _ a gamble that may not pay off.
</P>
<P>
   For the people of central and eastern Europe, torn by warfare
again and again in this century, the prospect of war breeds fear.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 100 years or more, they have been caught up in a
pattern of inimical pact-making. From the Balkan League of
pre-World War I, which bred the Balkan War pitting Bulgarians
against Serbia and Greece, to the opposing alliances of the two
murderous world wars and finally the nuclear standoff of NATO vs.
the Warsaw Pact in the Cold War, they have taken sides to survive,
trying to minimize the cost.
</P>
<P>
   For a majority of people in the region, said Ognyan Minchev,
director of the Institute for Regional and International Studies in
Sofia, ``the choice, in a very practical sense, is not between good
and evil, but between a lesser and greater evil.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Kosovo, he said, the lesser evil was NATO air
strikes following the brutal purge of hundreds of thousands of
ethnic Albanians from their Kosovo homes.
</P>
<P>
   The greater evil, in this view of things, is ``being isolated in
a security vacuum,'' given NATO's post-Cold War role as the sole
provider of international security in Europe, Minchev said.
</P>
<P>
   To act otherwise, he said, would be ``to remain on the other
side of the dividing line, away from those supporting the war, who
are also those supporting recovery investments after the war. That
is the reason why not a single government could resist saying `Yes'
to that kind of offer from NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Choosing the lesser evil does not remove the anxiety that stems
from fear of future relations in the Balkans, which could be
poisoned by having taken sides against a neighbor _ in Bulgaria's
case, Serbia, with whom the ties of religion and language are
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, the region is torn apart,'' Minchev said.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater worry is that of a protracted war that causes
even greater economic and human damage than has thus far occurred.
Such a prolonged war might seriously destabilize the fledgling
democracies of the region, born out of the collapse of Communism a
decade ago. New governments emerging from that prolonged war,
Minchev said, could involve political parties and movements not
oriented toward democracy and a market economy _ unlike most
governments in the region now.
</P>
<P>
   As the reality of the war looms, popular enthusiasm for NATO has
dropped. Recent polls say some 42 percent of Bulgarians favor
membership now, compared to 60 percent before the war.
</P>
<P>
   But Kostov, 49, who was swept into office in 1997 on a wave of
discontent with the policies of his former Communist predecessors,
dismissed such findings. ``If you asked Bulgarians whether there is
any other way,'' he said, ``60 percent would say no.''
</P>
<P>
   But the immediate reality is a beleaguered Bulgarian economy
facing a halving of growth this year because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Zaimov, deputy head of the National Bank, counted off the
economic casualties. Foreign investment was at a standstill, he
said in an interview, because ``people are not even willing to
travel to Bulgaria _ it's not a question of investing.''
</P>
<P>
   With land routes to western Europe cut in Yugoslavia and a
principal waterway _ the Danube _ blocked by bombed out bridges,
Bulgarian exports are collapsing. In the first quarter, export
revenues dropped 26 percent against last year. Bulgarian growth
this year, as a result, is expected to drop by almost half to 2
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most devastating effect, Zaimov said, was psychological
and involved Bulgarians' ``perception of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we had managed to instill in people a
reality in which they could sit back and have a longer horizon,''
he said. ``Now, people think, `This is war. We should sit and do
nothing, but wait and see.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria's political opposition, the former Communist party,
seems poised to exploit the malaise. Emboldened by public
discomfort with the war, the former Communists' resistance to NATO
is stiffening and they publicly question the wisdom of Bulgaria
casting its lot with the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, said Sergei Stanishev, head of the Socialist
Party's International Relations Department, the nation had little
luck with foreign alliances. The Balkan League led Bulgaria to
bitter defeat when its former allies, Serbia and Greece, turned
against it. In both world wars, Bulgaria lucklessly sided with the
central European powers around Germany, and was punished for doing
so. Its forced adherence to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact after World
War II left Bulgaria economically backward and militarily exposed
after the collapse of Communism and the Soviet empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always on the losing side,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, his party's opposition to the war merely
echoed common fears that Bulgaria would ultimately be browbeaten
into allowing air or ground attacks from its territory.
</P>
<P>
   `'If you say a, you have to say b, till the end of the
alphabet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kostov accuses the Socialists of opposing strong measures
against Milosevic out of sympathy for a fellow former Communist.
Milosevic ``has a totalitarian Communist regime which has sought
refuge in the last haven of nationalism and chauvinism,'' much as
Bulgaria's own Communists did in the late 1980s by oppressing and
expelling the country's Turkish minority, Kostov said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Kostov and his government gained power by borrowing
a chapter from the textbook of the Serbian opposition in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the angry strikes, protests and boycotts that forced
Kostov's Socialist predecessor, Zhan Videnov, to resign, were
loosely modeled on the 1996-97 protests in Serbia that fleetingly
forced Milosevic to accept that the Serbian opposition had won
local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kostov says, the Serbs are called upon to imitate the
Bulgarians and liberate themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs have to depose Milosevic, they have to put their
state into normal conditions,'' he said.

TEXAS HOUSE TENTATIVELY PASSES ANTI-ALCOHOL MEASURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
and KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In an outburst of anti-drinking fervor, the
Texas House voted Tuesday to ban open containers in vehicles,
prohibit alcohol sales in sexually oriented businesses and declare
bars off limits to unaccompanied minors.
</P>
<P>
   All the changes to Texas liquor and criminal laws were
tentatively approved in a single a bill that was supposed to be a
routine update of liquor regulations. But it turned into what
lawmakers call a ``Christmas tree'' _ a measure that started out
simple but finished up laden with dazzling proposals.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 3555 by Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston, was passed on a
vote of 75-38. After a final House vote Wednesday, the liquor
regulation bill goes to the Senate for further consideration and
possible stripping of the conservative amendments.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he didn't agree with all the amendments tacked onto
his bill, but collectively they reflected the mood of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything wrong with that. It speaks well
for this process,'' said Wilson, adding, ``this is not an exact
science.''
</P>
<P>
   Under existing law, open containers are not banned, although
drivers can be cited if an officer observes them in the act of
drinking alcohol while behind the wheel. As approved, Wilson's bill
bans open containers in the passenger compartment, with several
exceptions. A fine of $50 was set for violations.
</P>
<P>
   The exceptions would apply to people other than drivers in
commercial buses and mobile coaches. Liquor could be lawfully kept
in a locked glove box. An amendment for drivers of sport utility
vehicles would allow an open container to be stashed behind the
last fixed seat.
</P>
<P>
   Other defenses to prosecution were allowed, such as not knowing
the open container was in the vehicle, having an emergency that
prevented its proper storage or the driver requesting a
breathalyzer test and registering .02 percent blood alcohol content
or less.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition on booze in sexually oriented businesses was
proposed by Rep. Joe Nixon, R-Houston, who called strip clubs ``a
real problem in my district.`` Describing his proposal, Nixon said,
``It's a very simple fix. If you take the booze out of the sexually
oriented businesses, they go away.''
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many, a move to kill Nixon's amendment was
defeated 111-25. In similar fashion, the proposal to ban
unaccompanied minors in bars was overwhelmingly approved, even
though the ban has struggled as a self-contained bill.
</P>
<P>
   The action on the liquor bill was just part of the day's long
agenda. Members also gave final approval to a measure toughening
drunken-driving law by lowering the intoxication threshold to .08
percent of blood alcohol content, down from the current .10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to replace a patchwork of inadequate remedies, the House
also approved a $12.6 million state plan to alleviate beach erosion
along the 367-mile Texas Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   With no debate, the House made only minor changes to a bill that
has already won Senate approval. Senate Bill 1690 by Sen. David
Bernsen, D-Beaumont, faces a final House vote Wednesday before
being returned to the Senate for review of the House amendments.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would authorize the General Land Office to create a
coastal erosion response plan designed to address problems along
two-thirds of the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   House sponsor Patricia Gray, D-Galveston, said it was crucial
and that its passage was being demanded by many coastal residents.
``This is the re-election bill for anyone who lives on the Gulf
Coast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Senate, meanwhile, approved two bills that allocate
about $1.8 billion from the state's first payment in the tobacco
lawsuit settlement to establish permanent endowment funds. The
funds would then generate annual income for various health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   But a key senator said chances aren't good for an extra $30
million that several cancer-fighting groups hoped would remain in
the state budget for an anti-tobacco-use initiative.
</P>
<P>
   One measure, House Bill 1676, would set aside $500 million to
establish four permanent funds for anti-smoking education,
children's health, emergency medical services and rural health care
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The other measure, House Bill 1945, would set aside $580 million
in four higher education funds to cover research, treatment and
health education at public health-related universities.
</P>
<P>
   Both measures have already been approved by the Texas House but
will go back there for consideration of Senate changes. Senate
Finance Chairman Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, said he expects
the differences to be worked out in a House-Senate conference
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also approved a bill that would create covenant
marriage contracts designed to slow down the divorce rate by making
couples undergo premarital counseling and also to seek marriage
counseling when the marriage runs into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Covenant marriages would be optional, but couples who choose
that route would be able to seek a divorce only on certain grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't force two people to stay together,'' said bill
sponsor Sen. Tom Haywood, R-Wichita Falls. ``Nor can you eliminate
divorce altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   His bill, however, is likely to run into trouble of its own in
getting through the House before the end of the session May 31. A
similar bill never got out of committee in the House.

SENATE DEBATES YOUTH-CRIME BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK BRUNI  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate began debate Tuesday on a bill aimed
at reducing crime among children, Republicans focused on stricter
law enforcement, Democrats emphasized better prevention programs
and advocates of new gun-control measures confronted the prospect
that time would run out before their proposals could be considered.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, called the Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender
Accountability and Rehabilitation Act, is the first legislation
concerning juvenile crime to reach the floor of either chamber of
Congress since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo., three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties have described the bloodshed at
Columbine as an unignorable summons to action. But the comments of
senators both on and off the floor Tuesday illustrated how diverse
_ and, sometimes, conflicting _ their ideas about what to do are.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has attracted a profusion of suggested amendments,
creating the possibility that there would not be enough time to
discuss many of them and get to a final vote on the bill by
Thursday night. After that point, the Senate is expected to move on
to other business, and further consideration of the juvenile
justice bill could then be delayed for several weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   If that should happen, the amendments least likely to be
discussed would be those related to gun control. Republican leaders
said on Tuesday that those measures would come up for review last.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, said he
would not try to block consideration of any specific amendments,
including those on gun control, but conceded that he would have to
cut off debate at some point.
</P>
<P>
   He said his goal was for discussion of, and votes on, all
aspects of the bill to be completed by the end of the week. ``Is
that going to be achievable?'' Lott said. ``We'll have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott also made clear that in his view, gun control was not
central to the legislation. ``I hope this is about a bigger
question than guns,'' he said, ``and I wish the press would stop
focusing on guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats pushing for more gun control say that if
discussion on the bill is not completed this week, they will have
lost crucial momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our greatest worry,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
``It'll be much harder to pass then, because right now, people are
focused on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The unamended juvenile justice bill, whose principal sponsor is
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, calls for about $1 billion in federal
money to be distributed to local law-enforcement agencies and
governments for measures to crack down on juvenile crime and, in
some cases, to intervene early to rehabilitate offenders. Many
Democrats have complained that there is not enough emphasis on, or
money for, such prevention efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's principal gun-control measure prohibits gun ownership
for anyone who has committed a violent felony as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few amendments to the bill came up for votes early on
Tuesday night, and they highlighted the common ground that does
exist between the parties.
</P>
<P>
   By an overwhelming majority of 94 to 5, senators approved an
amendment calling for $200 million for schools and law-enforcement
agencies to develop strategies and to buy equipment to make schools
safer. By a similar margin, they approved an amendment to provide
$50 million to local prosecutors, mainly to combat gang violence.
</P>
<P>
   But a third amendment, put forward by Democrats, was defeated by
Republican opposition in a party-line vote of 55 to 44. It called
for a national school safety hot line and for more money for mental
health programs for students.
</P>
<P>
   As the bill made its way to the floor, Republicans and Democrats
staged dueling news conferences, each party trying to steer the
outrage over the Columbine shootings into the direction it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans continued to fix their attention not only on law
enforcement but also on the violence in the movies, video games and
songs to which children are exposed. They outlined several
amendments intended to study and tame those influences and said
that, in general, better enforcement of existing gun control laws
was more important, and potentially more effective, than new ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already got all kinds of gun laws on the books,'' Hatch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, however, responded to Democrats' concern about prevention
programs by agreeing to sponsor, along with Sen. Joseph R. Biden
Jr., D-Del., an amendment that would guarantee that 25 percent of a
$435 million block grant in the bill would be reserved for such
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Biden urged other Democrats to support that compromise, but it
was unclear how many would do so.

REPORTER FIRED FOR LIES ABOUT HER ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   (bl)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a series of newspaper columns written over the past year, a
33-year-old Kentucky reporter described her imminent death from
what she described to her readers as ``terminal brain cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Try to picture a world without dreams, without wishes, without
hope,'' Kim Stacy wrote in The Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, the
newspaper published in Kentucky's third-largest city. In prose
laden with references to her Christian faith, Ms. Stacy said she
had been told she had less than a year to live. She chronicled in
detail her conversations with oncologists and the metallic taste in
her mouth from chemotherapy treatments, and she wrote of her
friendship with an 8-year-old leukemia patient named Josh, who
died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I believe I am going to die?'' Ms. Stacy asked in a column
published last week. ``Yes, sometimes. We all are. I'm not so
foolish as to deny it or to pretend my illness doesn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Stacy admitted to her editors Monday that she had lied,
acknowledging an act of deception that resembles the circumstances
surrounding the resignations of two Boston Globe columnists last
year. She said that, in fact, she had been found to have AIDS four
years ago and that because of the stigma associated with the
disease, she had chosen not to reveal the true nature of her
illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a small-town atmosphere where you are crucified
for having AIDS or being gay,'' Ms. Stacy, who is a lesbian, told
The Associated Press on Monday. ``Nobody knew until this weekend
that I have AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to Ms. Stacy's home were not answered Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Messenger-Inquirer publisher T. Edward Riney said he fired Ms.
Stacy on Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with her and asked her to tell the story, and she said
she wrote the cancer story to cover for what she believes to be a
life-threatening case of AIDS,'' Riney said. ``At that point, we
dismissed her because of the deception to our readers, not because
of any other reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ashley, the newspaper's editor, said in an article published
Tuesday's in The Messenger-Inquirer that his first reaction was
shock. ``Beyond that,'' he wrote, ``my reaction encompassed being
angry, being embarrassed that we had been misled and misled our
readers, and at the same time feeling personal compassion for Kim
Stacy and what she must have been going through, and must be going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of Ms. Stacy's columns were published in The
Messenger-Inquirer, and a sixth had been scheduled to run Sunday,
but was canceled. One of the columns was also distributed in
Kentucky by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stacy told her editors that the columns were fabricated only
after three former co-workers from The Appalachian News-Express in
Pikeville, Ky., approached her about inconsistencies between what
she had written in her columns and what she had told them in
personal conversations. Ms. Stacy had worked as a reporter at The
News-Express until March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, while she was a reporter at The News-Express, she
informed the newspaper staff that stomach cancer had been diagnosed
by her doctors. In 1997, she told staff members that the illness
was in remission, and she was featured in a cover story on cancer
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   When she began working at The Messenger-Inquirer last year, she
told that newspaper's staff that she had a brain tumor that would
almost certainly result in her death. Her editors asked her to
write a series of columns about dying.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Riney said he asked her why she had fabricated the
columns. ``She said, once you start telling little lies, you have
to keep covering them up with bigger lies, and then even bigger
lies, and pretty soon the lies are out of your control and take
over,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Riney said he did not think that Ms. Stacy had been motivated or
inspired by the fabrications of two Boston Globe columnists last
year. In one incident, a Globe columnist, Patricia Smith, admitted
that she had fabricated characters and quotes; in another case,
columnist Mike Barnicle admitted that he had recycled stories he
had heard from others, and published them without checking whether
they were true.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that she may have been trying to draw
attention to herself,'' Riney said. ``I don't know what her motives
are beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ms. Stacy would not reveal the name of the doctor
treating her, and that he had not confirmed that she had AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stacy had told him, Riney said, that she had been undergoing
treatment at an AIDS treatment center at Vanderbilt University
Hospital in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Scanlan, a hospital spokesman, said the hospital did
have an AIDS treatment center but that he could not confirm that
someone was a patient without the consent of the patient and the
doctor.

SPORTS COLUMN: A FLAWED RANKING SYSTEM WILL BE GONE NEXT YEAR

</P>
<P>
   The 1999 slump has spread through the men's tennis tour like a
computer virus: The No. 1 player lost six straight first rounders;
the No. 2 hasn't won a title since October; the No. 3 would be
ranked 61st based on this year's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the slump has had little impact on the computer ranking
of the premier hitters, who coast along on a 52-week cushion where
only a player's best 14 results count and first-round losses at
Grand Slams can be wished away.
</P>
<P>
   But the slump has taken a toll on a variety of reputations, and
it prompted the ATP Tour chief, Mark Miles, to make an emergency
trip to Rome over the weekend to instruct the current No. 1 and
head slumper, the Australian Open champion, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, to
start talking and playing like an advertisement for the sport, not
a saboteur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him three things,'' Miles said. ``First, you get off to
a great start and you're going to be No. 1. Second, you go 0-for-6
and the public wants to know what's happening. Third, you lose in
Monte Carlo and say you don't care even though you really do. I
think he got the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Scott, the tour's chief operating officer, said Miles came
away from his Sunday meeting with Kafelnikov convinced that the
player has a better grip on his responsibilities to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark told him he's doing a disservice to himself, and to his
fellow players, to leave the impression that he doesn't care about
losing,'' Scott said. ``He made it clear that if you connect all
the dots, from Yevgeny becoming No. 1 in the middle of this
horrendous slump to making comments that make people question his
commitment, that we're not going to accept that from him.'' He
termed Kafelnikov's behavior a defense mechanism rather than actual
lack of interest in his results and repute.
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov said on Monday: ``Losing six times in a row in the
first round really depressed myself, and seeing a couple of the
most renowned newspapers say it's embarrassing to have me as No. 1,
I can assure you, I feel really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov, who snapped out of his slump with a first-round
victory at the Italian Open on Monday, also explained that his
comments after a 38-minute loss to 196th-ranked Ivo Ljubicic last
month in Monte Carlo were taken out of his intended context.
``Maybe I said I didn't care at all, but I was devastated,'' said
Kafelnikov, whose slide began on Feb. 25. When you're not winning
any matches since two months, it feels like you'll lose forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Kafelnikov, Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic are just a few of
the players to be accused of questionable conduct in recent months:
i.e., they've ``tanked'' matches (Kafelnikov and Ivanisevic were
accused of this in Prague), or dodged important tournaments
(Sampras opted for a vacation instead of the Australian Open),
because they know their standing won't suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dictatorship of the players is deadly dangerous for the
sport,'' Peter Kovarchik, a tournament director and promoter, said
last week from Vienna. ``The players get tremendous money without
100 percent effort.'' Kovarchik rocked the boat two weeks ago at
the Czech Open by refusing to pay Kafelnikov and Ivanisevic their
prearranged $100,000 appearance fees following first-round losses.
</P>
<P>
   After Dominik Hrbaty, one of the 26 different winners of the 29
ATP events played so far this season, won the Prague title,
Kovarchik said stars who don't try ``should be expelled.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles also made a trip to Prague to listen to Kovarchik's
complaints, but after consulting with the chair umpires and other
tour officials at the Czech Open, Miles was not convinced that
Kafelnikov or Ivanisevic deliberately dogged their matches.
Appearance fees are privately negotiated between tournaments and
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that if a guy gets a rap that he doesn't
try, the tournament directors will just stop offering him the
fees,'' said Scott. ``But the situation we have with the ranking
right now, where a guy like Sampras is ranked second even though
he's somewhere like 83rd based on the year's results, makes the
case for a change in the most clear way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ATP's opinion, if Pete Sampras looked at the number next
to his name and saw an 83, there would be more of a ``sense of
urgency'' about playing.
</P>
<P>
   If this year were next year, an 83 is what he'd see. And U.S.t
Open champion Patrick Rafter, now ranked fourth, would see the
unflattering numeral 117.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, tennis, like most other sports, will rate its players
on a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately basis, with a ranking race
that starts at ground zero. And every loss at a Slam, or at one of
the men's tour's Super Nine events like Monte Carlo, will count.
</P>
<P>
   Watch for Sampras, who entered 1999 one Slam shy of tying Roy
Emerson's all-time record dozen only to blithely skip the
Australian Open, to show up in Melbourne in 2000. Watch for
Kafelnikov to spend more than 38 minutes in the opening round at
Monte Carlo.
</P>
<P>
   No more living on last year's laurels. Next year the reputation,
and rank, should match.

 Snafu Lands Cable Modem User in a Jam
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Some people are willing to pay a high price for fast Internet
access, but going to jail may seem a bit steep for even the most
dedicated Net-heads.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Judy Sammel, a computer scientist in suburban Maryland,
faced the possibility of two years in jail and a $4,000 fine in her
attempt to get a lightening-fast Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Her crime? Getting a cable modem from Redwood City's AtHome
Corp. and Comcast Cablevision. When she got the cable Internet
service last March, Comcast accidentally gave her free cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   Although she notified Comcast about the mistake, eight months
after installing the service, Comcast slapped Sammel with four
counts of cable fraud, alleging she stole cable TV.
</P>
<P>
   The charges eventually were dropped and Sammel never went to
jail but she spent two months fighting the charges. During that
time, Sammel said, she was greeted by a uniformed Baltimore
policeman at her doorstep, was forced to appear in court and was
saddled with a temporary mark on her record indicating she was
charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   While early adopters of new technology often face problems like
software bugs and incompatible hardware, going to jail isn't a
pitfall most Internet pioneers encounter.
</P>
<P>
   Sammel's bizarre situation stemmed from her desire to get cable
modem service _ but not cable _ from Comcast/AtHome.
</P>
<P>
   A cable modem allows users to connect to the Internet via cable
TV lines at speeds up to 100 times faster than traditional dial-up
modems. AtHome provides the cable modem service through agreements
with various cable providers around the country. The firm operates
through TCI Cable in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   While the AtHome service uses a cable TV wire as its
``pipeline'' to the home, a customer does not need to get cable TV
service to be an AtHome subscriber. Cable subscribers pay an extra
$40 a month for the AtHome service. People who don't subscribe to
cable, like Sammel, usually pay $50 a month for AtHome.
</P>
<P>
   When the technicians came to install Sammel's cable modem
service, they did not attach a piece of equipment needed to block
the cable TV transmissions. So Sammel was able to watch CNN, ESPN
and other cable TV channels at no cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the installers told me to think of it as an incentive
for signing up with Comcast/AtHome,'' Sammel said. They told Sammel
someone would be back to install a ``video trap'' to block the
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever came back, and six months later, a policeman showed
up on Sammel's doorstep with a summons.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Rasmus, vice president for Comcast Online in
Philadelphia, said Sammel's case was an isolated incident that
won't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus said the problem occurred because the cable arm of
Comcast has a different billing system than Comcast Online, and the
two systems don't talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two billing systems didn't reflect each other's
information and so people in the cable organization didn't see that
this customer was a legitimate online customer,'' Rasmus said.
Thinking that Sammel was pilfering cable TV, the company decided to
file charges.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus said he knew of no other customer who had been charged
with cable theft but said it could have happened to others.
However, since the majority of customers get both cable TV and
cable modem service, the problem would not be widespread, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Ms. Sammel, she was in an unfortunate situation where the
planets aligned and everything that could go wrong, did go wrong,''
Rasmus said.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus said the company is working to merge the two billing
systems so the problem doesn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   AtHome Corp., which was not involved in pressing charges, said
Sammel's case was unusual. ``It was an isolated incident,'' said
AtHome spokesman Matt Wolfrom.
</P>
<P>
   Some other customers who have ordered just a cable modem and not
cable TV service say they've had problems similar to Sammel's,
although none has been charged with cable theft.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Susman, a Comcast/AtHome customer in New Jersey, had his
cable modem service disconnected three times by Comcast, which
accused him of stealing cable TV service. He said that when cable
workers were in the neighborhood and noticed he had a cable line
going to his house, they disconnected him because he didn't show up
as a Comcast subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Unlike Sammel, Susman, who gets satellite TV, was not
receiving free cable. But that didn't stop the company from
accusing Susman of cable theft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day of the third disconnect, my service was reconnected by
AtHome, and that night, a Comcast representative showed up at my
house remarking, `I see you hooked your cable up again. Do you
really want to go to jail?''' Susman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   While Susman's problem was resolved quickly, Sammel's journey to
clear her name bordered on the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Sammel said the minute she heard the words ``cable fraud,'' she
knew it had to do with the uninstalled video filter.
</P>
<P>
   She called Comcast to explain the situation and Comcast seemed
to agree it was a mistake. But five days later, a Comcast attorney
called to tell her the charges could not be dropped. An obscure
Maryland law prevented the plaintiff from dropping charges once the
case had been scheduled for trial. The only person who could drop
the charges, Sammel was told, was the assistant state attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he was out of town, and Sammel spent the next two
weeks trying to get the state attorney's office to drop the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get in touch with the guys at the state attorney's
office because they won't even let you through if you're a
defendant,'' Sammel said. ``They made me feel like a criminal every
time I called.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sammel threatened to file a countersuit against Comcast
for malicious prosecution, an action she credits with getting the
charges dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threatened to sue Comcast, and within an hour, I got a call
from the state attorney's office, saying they wouldn't prosecute,''
Sammel said.
</P>
<P>
   She also got a year's worth of AtHome service for free, a note
of apology from Comcast and a $50 gift certificate to her favorite
bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   But the ride isn't over yet.
</P>
<P>
   While she wasn't prosecuted, Sammel still has a mark on her
record indicating she was charged with a crime. That eventually
will be removed, but it will take several months.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, anyone who runs a background check on Sammel
could see this on her record, a fact she's not happy with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just applied for a part-time job teaching flute lessons here
and they made me sign something that agreed to a background
check,'' Sammel said. ``I was debating whether to say `If you find
something about cable fraud, talk to me,''' But she decided that
would make her look suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't heard back about the job.

IMPROVISED IMAGES IN MOLTEN WAX, AS FLUID AS JAZZ  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Edward M. Gomez is the author of the ``New Design'' series
(Rockport Publishers), with volumes on Tokyo, Los Angeles, Paris
and London.  
 By EDWARD M. GOMEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to modern artists to find intriguing beauty _ and
expressive power _ in the gooey textures of waxy buildup. New
materials and techniques have always attracted the avant-garde, but
paradoxically, during certain periods in the 20th century, an
ancient method of image making seized the imagination of many
experimental artists.
</P>
<P>
   The results of some of those experiments are on view from Sunday
through Aug. 15 at the Montclair Art Museum in Montclair, N.J.,
where ``Waxing Poetic: Encaustic Art in America'' examines its
theme in more than 70 works by modern and contemporary artists,
including Arthur Dove, Jasper Johns, Lynda Benglis and Michelle
Stuart.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, Gail Stavitsky, chief curator of the
Montclair Art Museum, has noticed that encaustic art has undergone
a resurgence among artists, art students, galleries and museums. As
the main organizer of ``Waxing Poetic,'' she has set out to
demonstrate the variety of expression achieved in a technique for
painting with molten wax that was first used in ancient Greece and
Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although more recent encaustic works, such as Jasper Johns'
paintings of American flags and numbers from the 1950s, have
exerted considerable influence, many artists today have been
inspired by the unforgettable Fayum portraits of the first and
second centuries A.D.,'' Ms. Stavitsky said. She referred to
pictures made by Greco-Roman artists when Egypt was part of the
Roman Empire; those now-legendary images, which had been attached
to mummy cases, were excavated in the early 19th century in the
Fayum region outside Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum of
Art house some well-preserved examples.
</P>
<P>
   Technically speaking, encaustic, a word that derives from the
Greek term enkaustikos, meaning to burn in, describes both a
substance and a method of painting in which dry pigments are mixed
with molten wax on a warm palette. Danielle Rice, an art historian
who has studied the encaustic revival that took place during the
18th-century neo-Classical period in Europe, writes in the
Montclair show's catalog that these special paints ``can be applied
to any ground or surface, including wood, plaster or canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, commercially prepared encaustic is made with refined
beeswax and dry pigment (from mineral ores, for example). It also
includes an important touch of damar resin. This natural tree resin
from the East Indies gives the mixture a higher melting temperature
and makes it harder.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rice also cites the following essential step in the
``classic'' form of the technique: ``It is traditional to pass a
heat source close to the surface of a finished painting to `burn
in' the colors, fusing and bonding them.''
</P>
<P>
   For purists, deviations from these basic mixing and burning-in
processes have always been problematic. Even now, sticklers for
accuracy insist on the primacy of both the medium's wax-oil-resin
recipe and the burning-in process. For them, both must be employed
for an artist's encaustic technique and resulting artwork to be
considered authentic.
</P>
<P>
   But before commercial encaustic became available in recent
decades, artists had to make their own. Some used linseed oil
instead of damar resin. Or as Johns told Ms. Stavitsky, some time
in the 1950s he came across a recipe calling for wax, varnish and
oil. In his case, he recalled mixing beeswax with tube oils on a
single-burner hot plate and using a sun lamp for the burning-in
process. (Today, heat guns and blow torches are common tools.)
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, Brice Marden made paintings with a mixture of
hot wax and tube-oil color. But for him, wax did not function as a
binder, and he did not fuse the layers of his works with an
external heat source.
</P>
<P>
   The works on paper, canvas and board as well as the sculptures
on view in ``Waxing Poetic'' offer evidence of the wide-ranging
effects that artists like these have achieved through their often
inconsistent, rule-bending adventures in hot wax. Invariably, such
encaustic artists have spoken of becoming captivated by the
distinctive, compelling properties of the technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process itself is uniquely part of the message,'' said
Richard Frumess, an artist and encaustic expert who advised the
show's organizers and wrote a technical essay for its catalog. With
his business partner, Jim Haskin, Frumess runs R&AMP;F Handmade Paints
in Kingston, N.Y., the world's largest supplier of commercially
made encaustic. (Such paints come in small, colored cakes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``When you fuse encaustic, you lose control over it, and it does
strange things,'' Frumess said. ``It's exciting to watch pigments
react chemically in odd ways. In this technique there is a kind of
chaos, which I believe appeals to modern artists and links up with
how we now think about the underlying nature of things.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Encaustic can be brushed onto a surface or applied with a
spatula. When it hardens, it can be scraped, incised or otherwise
sculptured.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Jemisin, an Alabama-born artist who keeps a studio in
Brooklyn, said: ``It's extremely fluid. It's improvisational, like
jazz. When you work with it, you have to become fluid, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Montclair show, Jemisin's abstract ``Carnivorous Dream''
(1998), with its graceful, white line drawing over broad washes of
color, highlights the breezy style he has developed in the medium
over some 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although contemporary work like Jemisin's is at the core of the
exhibition, ``Waxing Poetic'' also features seminal,
representational paintings by the Boston-based artist and teacher
Karl Zerbe, whose active promotion of encaustic set off its revival
in America in the pre-Johns era. Likewise, a lyrical abstraction
like ``Morning'' (1940) by Arthur Dove, who used his own
oil-and-wax-emulsion variant of encaustic, proves that the
investigation of new materials and techniques was an integral part
of modern artists' search for a new visual language.
</P>
<P>
   And Alfonso Ossorio's ``Headdress'' (1950), with its red, white
and green surface _ a blend of ink, watercolor and wax resembling
an Abstract Expressionist pizza _ is a reminder that it was this
Philippine-born painter who inspired his friend Jackson Pollock to
explore wax-based methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Its layers are transparent, depending on how much pigment you
use, and it can be used simultaneously as a painting and as a
collaging medium,'' Ms. Stavitsky said, describing encaustic's
flexibility. ``Functioning like a membrane, it's malleable and
evokes bodily sensations, emotion, layers of history, religious
rituals and the passage of time. All are themes contemporary
artists have been exploring.''
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, encaustic's appeal as a medium of evocative
visual metaphor can be seen in Michael David's ``Jackie No. 9''
(1997), a large enigmatic image on plywood depicting a nude woman
standing against a blue background. The figure gazes out at viewers
through a layer of milky-white wax. ``Encaustic is physically
direct,'' David said from his home in Brooklyn. ``With its
translucency, you sense the similarity between the skin represented
in the picture and the skinlike quality of the medium itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Artists like David have also spoken about encaustic's ``very
physical, very cerebral'' qualities and of the ``deep personal
involvement'' they experience when working with it. Ms. Rice
attributes this to the ``almost alchemical'' nature of a medium
that has seduced artists and viewers alike with its magical
combination of wax, fire and pigment.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Waxing Poetic,'' this can be sensed as much in the vivid
Fayum portrait of a laurel-crowned man from A.D. 120 to 130, on
loan from the Brooklyn Museum of Art, as in the vaguely plantlike
forms made of plaster, pulp and encaustic by the New York-based
sculptor Mia Westerlund Roosen in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, debates about the authenticity of variants of
encaustic's ``classic'' formula will roil on. But as Johns, who
worked with it almost exclusively from 1954 to 1958, told Ms.
Stavitsky, his extensive use of the medium had given him ``a sense
of becoming more independent and more focused, recognizing private
strengths, doing something which was my own.''
</P>
<P>
   For artists, the promise of such rich, creative opportunities
may help explain the odd technique's enduring allure. Meanwhile,
for art lovers, encaustic's strong appeal may simply boil _ or melt
_ down to the special ways in which works produced in this peculiar
medium can both embody the spirit of their creators and physically
record the manner of their making.

<TEXT>
<P>
   U S West Inc. said Tuesday that Solomon Trujillo, the local
phone carrier's chief executive, had been elected chairman.
</P>
<P>
   While U S West is the smallest of the Baby Bell local phone
giants, Trujillo's elevation may make it the biggest company in the
nation with a Hispanic chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo, 47, took over the job from Richard McCormick, 58, who
stepped down and was elected chairman emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Trujillo takes over U S West at a moment when most of the
nation's other big phone companies are busy consolidating. Of the
seven original Baby Bells, only five remain, and U S West and
BellSouth Corp. are the only two that have not participated in
multibillion-dollar mergers.
</P>
<P>
   With its largely rural service region, which includes the Rocky
Mountain states and the Dakotas, U S West has long failed to match
the financial performance of the other Bells. But it has been the
leader among them in deploying high-speed Internet service using an
advanced phone technology called digital subscriber line. And the
logistical problems in serving many of its customers may help
protect it from competition from new local phone companies.

TV DRAGNET NABS FUGITIVE DRAG QUEEN ON `JERRY SPRINGER SHOW' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LISA TEACHEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A recent guest on the ``Jerry Springer Show'' may be
watching future episodes of the slugfest talk program from behind
bars.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Johnson, 22, was arrested Monday in Louisiana as he and
family members gathered at a relative's house to watch the national
broadcast of an episode about drag queens, featuring Johnson and
his sister Veronica.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who uses the aliases Alicia, Poppy, Christina and John,
is charged in Harris County, Texas, with aggravated assault with a
deadly weapon. He is accused of stabbing Reginald Hickman in the
neck last month in southeast Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The show featuring Johnson, wearing a skimpy green dress, was
taped earlier and aired Monday _ at the same time Houston homicide
detectives John Burmester and Brian Harris were on the phone with
authorities in Louisiana trying to track him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just happened to call on the day all of this was
happening,'' Harris said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   His partner was on the phone with police in Lecompte, La.,
Harris said, while he was talking to authorities in Cheneyville,
La.
</P>
<P>
   ``My partner gave the officer a description of Johnson and the
officer laughed and said, `I think he's on TV right now,'`` Harris
said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispatcher in Cheneyville also was watching the show. ``She
said, `They're (Johnson and his sister) on TV right now
fighting,''' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just looked at each other and said `This is
unbelievable.'''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently most people in both of the small towns between
Alexandria and Lafayette in south-central Louisiana knew Johnson
and were tuned in to catch his act on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was quickly arrested at his family's home in Rapides
Parish _ in front of the gathering of relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The detectives were still trying Monday to determine whether
Johnson taped the show before or after the stabbing. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Since Johnson was on parole for a felony forgery conviction, he
will be held without bail after his return to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson allegedly stabbed Hickman with a paring knife April 11
during an argument between Hickman and Johnson's sister.

   The couple, who Harris said were common-law husband and wife,

UTILICORP UNITED AGREES TO BUY EMPIRE DISTRICT ELECTRIC CO. OF
JOPLIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UtiliCorp United Inc. has agreed to buy Empire District Electric
Co. of Joplin, Mo., in yet another sign that just the prospect of
deregulation is creating fewer but larger electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the Empire deal Tuesday came only two months
after UtiliCorp agreed to buy St. Joseph Light &AMP; Power Co. The
purchases need regulatory approval, and UtiliCorp hopes to complete
both in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of those two utilities, combined with
UtiliCorp's Missouri Public Service Co. in Raytown, will give the
company a geographic reach from the Iowa border to Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   And by cobbling together three relatively small utilities,
UtiliCorp will have more electric customers in Missouri than any
other utility except Ameren UE in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The Empire acquisition ``is a significant step in growing
UtiliCorp's domestic operations,'' said Robert K. Green,
UtiliCorp's president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement has been approved by the directors of both
companies and now must be voted on by Empire's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Empire transaction is valued at about $800 million.
UtiliCorp will spend $505 million to redeem Empire's common shares
and an additional $33 million for its preferred shares. UtiliCorp
also will assume $260 million of Empire's debt.
</P>
<P>
   UtiliCorp will get a utility that has 145,000 customers in
southwest Missouri and in five counties in Kansas, Oklahoma and
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The utility, which is to become a UtiliCorp subsidiary, will
keep the Empire name and be treated as a separate entity before
regulators. That probably means no big changes for ratepayers,
although UtiliCorp executives said some cost savings from the
merger should benefit Empire's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those savings will come from an undetermined number of
job cutbacks at Empire, which will see some duties transferred to
UtiliCorp's Kansas City offices. Green said any affected Empire
employees could apply for other jobs at UtiliCorp, which has about
400 openings.
</P>
<P>
   Empire shareholders will receive $29.50 for each share of common
stock. Empire's stock closed Friday at $21.25. Using that figure,
shareholders are receiving a 39 percent premium with the UtiliCorp
offer.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price, however, can vary, depending on the price of
UtiliCorp stock, which closed Tuesday at $23.94, down 25 cents.
Empire shareholders will get less if UtiliCorp's share price falls
below $22. They will get more if it rises above $26.
</P>
<P>
   Empire shareholders will also get a choice of cash or UtiliCorp
stock, although there will be limits on how much of each can be
used.
</P>
<P>
   Empire was founded 90 years ago and was able to survive various
challenges, including the Great Depression. But the prospect of
deregulation _ even though it's probably years away in Missouri and
Kansas _ helped to force the move Tuesday, said Myron W. McKinney,
Empire's top executive.
</P>
<P>
   He said Empire had been discussing the future of electric
utilities for the past decade and how the company could survive in
the new environment. In the last three years it realized that it
needed to find a larger partner.
</P>
<P>
   UtiliCorp, with more than $12 billion in sales, will give Empire
the platform it needs, McKinney said.
</P>
<P>
   If the St. Joseph Light and Empire acquisitions are completed,
UtiliCorp will have 375,000 electric customers in Missouri. Ameren
UE has more than 1 million and Kansas City Power &AMP; Light has
256,000 in Missouri, according to figures from the Missouri Public
Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   KCP&AMP;L has 448,000 customers altogether when it counts those in
Kansas. A merger of Western Resources and KCP&AMP;L, which still needs
regulatory approval, would produce a utility with 1 million
customers in Kansas and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Size matters, said Green of UtiliCorp, as electric utilities are
exposed to the free market. A larger utility, for instance, can
better withstand changes in the wholesale electricity market, which
is already deregulated. Its size can also achieve more economies to
make it more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   That being the case, UtiliCorp will continue buying utilities.
That could include more in Kansas and Missouri and possibly
municipally owned utilities, Green said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be done for a long, long time,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A FEW GOOD WORDS
</P>
<P>
   Many of the key passages in the Rev. Martin Luther King's Aug.
28., 1963, ``I Have a Dream'' speech _ about 600 words that are
among the best remembered and most quoted _ were not in the advance
text given to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The trademark ``I have a dream'' phrase and the thoughts that
follow from it were not in the text handed out that day when King
spoke on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, nor were the passages
introduced with his ``let freedom ring'' cry.
</P>
<P>
   It is the use of these specific words, among others _ film
archives of his delivery of them _ that has prompted his family to
sue organizations that reprint or replay them without the Kings'
permission.
</P>
<P>
   THE COST OF A DREAM
</P>
<P>
   CBS, which taped and broadcast the ``I Have A Dream'' speech,
licenses segments or ``clips'' of the speech.
</P>
<P>
   According to court motions filed by lawyers for the estate of
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., the network charges:
</P>
<P>
   _ $2,500 a minute of the clips to private entities and
</P>
<P>
   _ $1,000 a minute to churches, schools and other non-profits.

 By TIM GOLDEN and JEFF GERTH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in the spring of 1996, federal bank examiners discovered
that the central bank of China was moving tens of millions of
dollars into the United States, depositing it in a maze of accounts
controlled by a fast-rising Chinese executive at a small California
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators struggled for almost two years to understand the
transactions, guessing finally that they might have been intended
to hide the private fortunes of Chinese officials. They turned
their findings over to the Justice Department, the State Department
and the FBI, but officials said no legal or diplomatic action was
ever taken in the case.
</P>
<P>
   But only in recent months, prodded by Congressional
investigators, have U.S. officials started fitting together some of
the most significant pieces of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The banker in California, Nan Nan Xu, turned out to have a
series of ties to a Chinese military officer who has been
identified as the conduit for at least $300,000 sent from the
military's intelligence chief to a Democratic fund-raiser,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   And almost half of the $92 million that eventually flowed from
China into the California bank, Far East National, came from a Hong
Kong investment firm controlled in part by two men who American
officials say have been associated with Chinese intelligence
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the money remains a mystery. Some federal
officials now suspect that it might have been intended to pay for
Chinese intelligence operations. Others believe that it could have
been amassed for political contributions or to purchase sensitive
military technology. And officials do not rule out that it could be
related to legitimate business dealings.
</P>
<P>
   But a close look at the case, based on interviews and
confidential Government documents, shows that the Clinton
administration was slow to pursue or even pull together the
disparate leads uncovered over several years by different agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the Chinese money flow was the sort of
information that typically sets off alarms among government
investigators and the bank examiners alerted Justice Department
officials early on. But officials said the department initially
gave the matter only a cursory review, even as it was separately
searching elsewhere for evidence of Chinese contributions to
American political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors in Los Angeles examined the case last year,
but then referred it back to the Justice Department in July, asking
that its international-affairs section determine whether the
transactions might involve criminal activity in China. A law
enforcement official said the case was investigated further, but
declined to say how.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Justice Department, Myron Marlin, would not
comment on the inquiry but he said the department was ``vigorously
pursuing every credible allegation that has come our way.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also agreed last year to consider raising
the issue with officials in Beijing, but then decided against it,
officials said. The FBI _ which had helped Ms. Xu, a Chinese
national, to gain legal residency in the United States in 1992 and
then tried unsuccessfully to recruit her as an informer _ paid
relatively little attention to her in the years when her banking
activities became suspect, several officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just fell off the screen,'' one federal investigator
familiar with the case said.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the administration contend that the handling of the
inquiry reflects a pattern of sluggish government responses to
indications of Chinese military and espionage activity in the
United States in recent year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This information was in the hands of the Department of
Justice, Department of State, and the FBI,'' the Republican
chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, Richard
Shelby of Alabama, wrote in a letter last Friday asking the Senate
Banking Committee to continue an inquiry into the matter begun by
the Intelligence Committee last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also provided this and additional information to the FBI
and the Justice Department on numerous occasions during the course
of our investigation,'' Shelby continued. ``It is my understanding,
however, that nobody from the federal campaign contributions
investigation has followed up in any significant manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Ms. Xu and her former boss at Far East National
Bank, Henry Hwang, denied any wrongdoing in their handling of the
Chinese money, and the bank's president, Robert Oehler, said it had
not been cited for any regulatory violations in connection with the
affair. But Ms. Xu and Hwang declined to explain where the $92
million had come from or how they managed it, citing client
confidentiality. Nor would Ms. Xu describe her involvement with
Chinese officials in detail, other than to emphasize that she does
not work for the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xu told banking regulators that much of the money consisted
of Chinese loans to small investment companies that she and Hwang
had established in California, documents show. Yet a detailed
report on the matter written last year by investigators for the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency cast doubt on that
explanation, concluding that the money was probably being hidden
for Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xu's explanation does not resolve this central issue,'' the
lawyers wrote in the 76-page report, a copy of which was obtained
by The New York Times. ``We believe the likely explanation lies
with Xu's connections and self-dealing by Chinese officials.''
</P>
<P>
   UNLIKELY PARTNERS FOR A CENTRAL BANK
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hwang nor Ms. Xu were obvious partners for Peoples' Bank
of China, as the country's central bank is called.
</P>
<P>
   Hwang, 69, is a well-known figure among Chinese-Americans in Los
Angeles, an elder statesman who delights in telling the story of
his rise to the boardroom from a job in a laundry. His office is
decorated with photographs of himself with various American
presidents, including Bill Clinton, and with a poster from ``M.
Butterfly,'' the Broadway hit written by his son, David Henry
Hwang, who was formerly a director of the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hwang helped start Far East National Bank in 1974 with
$1.5 million in capital and a single branch office in the Chinatown
section of Los Angeles. By 1997, when it was sold to Banc SinoPac
of Taiwan, it had $514 million in assets and 10 branches around the
state, but it remained a community bank with profits that rarely
exceeded $5 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Hwang was at the center of a major scandal in Los
Angeles when it was disclosed that he had hired the then-Mayor, Tom
Bradley, as a paid consultant. Bradley had also received a loan
from the bank, and appeared to have helped it secure a $2 million
deposit of city funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he was supposed to help the bank develop business
abroad but had been of little use before he was forced to resign
from the consultancy. Hwang, however, was soon having better luck
with overseas business. The key to his success was Nan Nan Xu.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xu (pronounced ``shoo''), 48, came to the United States in
1987 with a student visa and plans to learn some English.
</P>
<P>
   Her references were excellent: A physician by training, she is
the daughter of a member of the Communist Party's old guard, Xu
Yunbei, a former deputy minister of health and minister of light
industry. But she had no banking experience at all when she walked
into Hwang's office and persuaded him to give her a $900-a-month
job helping Far East National drum up Chinese business in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't understand mainland China very well,'' Ms. Xu said
over tea in the offices she now keeps in a business tower in
downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   She was by all accounts a stunning success. Using contacts at
the consulate that China had then just opened in Los Angeles, she
persuaded scores of Chinese firms to leave big banks for Far East
National. She also began to build the bank's business in China,
winning approval from the Chinese authorities to open an office for
the bank in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without her connections, we could not have gotten a
representative office there,'' Hwang, now the bank's vice chairman,
said of Ms. Xu. ``I go to China to carry a briefcase for Nan Nan
Xu.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xu was made a senior vice president in 1993, a managing
director in 1994 and, according to Hwang, was its highest-paid
executive after himself at one point before she left the bank in
1997 a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A FLOOD OF MONEY RAISES SUSPICIONS
</P>
<P>
   As Far East National's China business was starting to flourish,
the bank was also quietly taking in huge deposits of Chinese
government money.
</P>
<P>
   In late November of 1992, Far East National received the first
$5 million in a series of wire transfers from the Peoples' Bank of
China, from one of its apparent subsidiaries, and from another
state bank.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the money went to an account for Far East
International Trading Corp., a shell company that Hwang had
incorporated a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1993, Ms. Xu incorporated her own California shell
company, Four Earth Investment and Trading Corp., and over the next
32 months, it absorbed a flood of Chinese money. Another $40
million came from the central bank. The China Construction Bank
wired $5 million. More than $42 million came from United Wide
Investments, a Hong Kong concern that American regulators believe
was controlled by the Chinese Government.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said one of Ms. Xu's accounts also received an early
deposit of almost $50,000 from a Chinese military company that
manufactures and markets advanced weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xu has given varying accounts of these dealings. At one
point, she told bank regulators the Chinese funds were investments
that she was handling with the help of outside brokers. In other
instances, she characterized transfers in and out of the accounts
as loans.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Ms. Xu wasn't much of an investor, losing more
than $5 million on a large purchase of Mexican pesos in 1994, just
before the currency was devalued. But most of the money she
received from China was paid back with some interest.
</P>
<P>
   Government documents show the regulators found many of her
transactions suspicious, sometimes because she often moved the
Chinese money through different accounts before placing it, and
other times because she could not document purported loans. As far
as the investigators could determine, $10 million was never repaid
to the Peoples' Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the activity in Ms. Xu's accounts, like some of her
business in China, points to an influential Chinese official whom
she described to regulators as an old friend: Chen Yuan, a former
deputy governor of the central bank and the son of a powerful
Chinese official of the 1970's and `80's.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe that Chen, who is now president of the
China Development Bank, may have been responsible for at least some
of the funds moved into Ms. Xu's accounts. And among her few
expenditures that can be traced are more than $200,000 paid to
Chen's son, including $46,000 to cover some of his tuition at
Cornell University.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, an aide to Chen Yuan said he had no involvement with
the money sent to Far East National Bank and would therefore have
no comment on it. A spokeswoman for the central bank also did not
respond to questions about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to the Banking Committee, Shelby warned that he
was especially concerned about accusations that the former
comptroller of the currency, Eugene Ludwig, had blocked an
investigation of Far East National.
</P>
<P>
   Both Ludwig and a spokesman for the comptroller's office
strongly denied that. Interviews with two people who participated
in the investigation also suggested that there was no evidence to
support those claims, which were made in an Aug. 27, 1996
memorandum from a Federal Reserve examiner.
</P>
<P>
   While the comptroller's office expressed pride about their
inquiry, other officials said the investigation was slow to get
underway and might never have taken place had it not been for
prodding by the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's office began its investigation in mid-July
1996. On Aug. 5, Hwang, a lifelong Republican, gave $10,000 to the
Democratic Party, records show. He said his contribution was
prompted by President Clinton's sympathy and support for ethnic
minorities in America.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the examiners began a second, more specific
inquiry. But according to officials and internal documents, Federal
Reserve officials came away dissatisfied with both the bank's
forthrightness and the resolve of the comptroller's office to force
its disclosure of key documents.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the comptroller's senior aide for enforcement
matters, Daniel Stipano, a senior Federal Reserve official, Herbert
Biern, wrote that examiners suspected fraudulent activities at Far
East National, but felt the bank's lack of cooperation had
prevented a ``thorough review.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a perception that there could be some sensitivity
relating to this case within the OCC because of a personal
relationship between Mr. Hwang and the comptroller,'' Biern
continued, apparently echoing the allegations of the examiner,
Philip Holt. ``Although this may have absolutely no basis in fact,
we thought you should be aware of it because under the
circumstances, you may want to take steps to assure that even the
appearance of preferential handling is avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Ludwig said that while he might have met Hwang at
bankers meetings, he never intervened on his behalf. ``This guy is
no buddy of mine,'' said Ludwig, who retired as comptroller in 1998
and is now the vice chairman of Bankers Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Biern's Nov. 19 letter, the comptroller's office
gave final approval for a formal investigation of Far East
National. On June 23, 1997, about six months into the inquiry,
Stipano convened from the Justice Department and other
law-enforcement agencies to describe its initial findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not oblivious to the fact that this could be money
laundering, that it could be embezzlement, that it could be
campaign-finance related,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry was completed early the next spring. No charges were
brought, and no regulatory actions taken.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the June 1997 meeting, Justice Department and FBI
officials were already searching for flows of Chinese money into
American political coffers. And they were focusing closely on one
of Ms. Xu's relatives by marriage, a Chinese military officer and
aerospace executive named Liu Chao-ying.
</P>
<P>
   A California businessman, Johnny Chung, told authorities Ms. Liu
was the conduit for $300,000 from the head of China's Military
Intelligence Directorate, Gen. Ji Shingde, officials said. Federal
investigators have traced a small amount of that money to
Democratic campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xu said she was not questioned by federal investigators
until almost a year later, and then only briefly. She said the
officials asked about her role in setting up a checking account for
Ms. Liu in 1991, but dropped the matter after she explained that
Ms. Liu was the sister of her younger brother's wife, and that she
had no other business involvement with her.
</P>
<P>
   They are not my favorite people,'' Ms. Xu said of her in-laws.
``I live in a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   Several American officials privately questioned that assertion,
saying Ms. Liu traveled to China with Ms. Xu at least once, in
1991. Ms. Liu has also used Ms. Xu's identity as an alias on at
least one occasion, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On June 3, 1998, the comptroller's office called a second,
larger interagency meeting to present the findings of its
investigation into Far East National.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a situation where we had identified a piece of a much
bigger puzzle,'' Stipano, the agency's enforcement director, said.
``And the rest of the puzzle was not something that we had the
ability or the authority to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the investigators thought some of the $92 million might
have been diverted by Chinese officials, a State Department
official was asked to consider raising the matter with Beijing. The
Department decided against that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a foreign policy issue that one raises with the
Foreign Ministry,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, an official said the matter was initially passed on
to a task force investigating campaign-finance cases questions. The
task force later referred it back to the bureau's headquarters in
Washington, which forwarded it to the FBI field office in Los
Angeles. Although the field office brought the case to the office
of the U.S. attorney there, word of it only belatedly reached
agents in foreign counterintelligence _ those who knew the most
about Ms. Xu.

   NEW YORK _ Individual investors will be given an edge over
institutional investors in the distribution of about $1 billion
that Nasdaq dealers paid to settle a landmark 1994 antitrust
class-action case accusing them of fixing prices on Nasdaq shares.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plan that lawyers expect to mail to Nasdaq investors
next month, all investors will share in the settlement fund based
on how many Nasdaq trades they made during the seven-year period
covered by the settlement, which was the largest in antitrust
history.
</P>

   But under the plan, each trade by an individual investor will be
give 50 percent more weight in the calculations than a trade by an
institutional investor.
</P>
<P>
   The typical institutional investors will still collect far more
than an individual, of course, because the volume of an
institution's Nasdaq trades is so much larger than that of a
typical individual investor. But the arrangement means that
individual investors will get more of the settlement fund than they
otherwise would have, class-action lawyers agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Grundfest, a Stanford University law professor and former
member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said he believed
the distinction made between individuals and institutions ``may be
the first of its kind.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was first reported by James M. Newman, the
publisher and editor of Securities Class-Action Alert, a newsletter
that monitors securities litigation. Newman, too, called the
preferential treatment for individual investors surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not another example of it that I can think of,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Lovell, a member of the legal team that pursued the
novel antitrust class-action case, said the unusual formula was
simply the result of the routine practice of trying to distribute a
settlement in ways that reflect the reality of the harm that was
done.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, institutional investors were able to trade Nasdaq
stocks on private trading networks, such as Instinet, where they
could routinely get better prices than those available to
individual investors. As a consequence, institutions suffered less
from the price-fixing activity charged in the antitrust litigation
than individual investors did, Lovell said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual distribution formula was part of an overall
distribution plan that received preliminary approval from federal
Judge Robert W. Sweet in Manhattan on March 9. Objections to the
plan will be heard by Sweet in October, and all investors' claims
must be filed by December.
</P>
<P>
   Lovell said the settlement administrators hope to distribute the
money to investors late next year, but Newman said he thought that
target was ``very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   The formula favoring individual investors was devised with help
from a group of deputy attorneys general from various states. ``We
felt that they could be neutral because their constituents include
both citizens, as individual investors, and their own state pension
funds, as institutions,'' Lovell said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Perino, a law professor at St. John's University in New
York who studies class-action litigation, agreed that the formula
is unusual. But he said he doubted it would be copied in future
securities class-action cases because such cases typically hinged
on the decline in the stock's price, which affects all investors in
the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution plan is the latest step in a journey that began
in May 1994, when a team of class-action lawyers accused 37 major
brokerage companies, including Merrill Lynch; Lehman Brothers;
Goldman, Sachs; Salomon Smith Barney _ now part of Citigroup _ and
Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, of artificially fixing prices on
Nasdaq stock they traded between May 1989 and mid-July 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Nasdaq dealers were accused of conspiring to
inflate their own profits by artificially widening the gap between
the price at which investors could buy a Nasdaq stock and the price
at which they could sell it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which experts considered to be a long shot,
prompted the Justice Department and the SEC to undertake their own
investigations of the Nasdaq market. Those inquiries, in turn, led
to far-reaching changes aimed at making the market fairer for all
investors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, most of the defendants settled price-collusion charges
filed by the Justice Department. Earlier this year, the SEC
collected more than $26 million in fines from 28 Wall Street firms
involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Sweet awarded the class-action lawyers a
record-setting fee of $144 million for their work on the case,
about 14 percent of the settlement award, plus $4.4 million in
expenses.

 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adam Guettel, the young songwriter, was initially
reluctant to do the concert of his work scheduled for Wednesday
night at Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He says he felt he had been out there enough lately. His musical
``Floyd Collins'' is playing in Chicago after performances in San
Diego and Philadelphia and may return to New York, where it was
produced in 1996. His song cycle ``Saturn Returns'' was performed
at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in April 1998. His CD ``Myths and
Hymns,'' was released in March by Nonesuch Records. The singer
Audra McDonald has included his songs on her recent CD and in
concert performances.
</P>
<P>
   And Guettel has increasingly been referred to as important to
the future of musical theater, along with other young composers
like Ricky Ian Gordon, Michael John LaChiusa, Jeanine Tesori and
Jason Robert Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resisted this pretty strenuously,'' said Guettel, 34,
speaking about Wednesday night's concert the other day. ``It's not
seemly. I just had these shows in New York. People have already
heard this stuff. I just want to write something new.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nonesuch Records president Robert Hurwitz, who has become a
strong supporter of Guettel, quickly put things into perspective,
Guettel recalled with amused resignation. ``He said: `Now let me
get this straight. You think you're famous or something? No one
knows who you are. You have to do this.'''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that Guettel is known, he has often been
pigeonholed as the talented composer of inaccessible music, tunes
you don't come out humming. All the more reason, some might argue,
for getting his music out there as often as possible; the more
people hear it, the sooner they will accept it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hummability has to do with how many times you hear
something,'' said Stephen Sondheim, who has encouraged Guettel.
``It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Guettel certainly descends from a hummable tradition; his
grandfather was Richard Rodgers. He died when Guettel was 15 and
was trying to chart his own course for his compositions, playing
electric bass in a rock band, listening to Jimi Hendrix, Santana
and Jethro Tull. ``I didn't want to do the obvious, to try to
follow in my family tradition,'' Guettel said. ``I felt that would
be a terrible mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He played only one composition for his grandfather, just before
he died. Guettel played it loud on the piano so his grandfather,
lying in bed on the other side of the wall, could hear it. Guettel
said his grandfather liked the piece.
</P>
<P>
   As Guettel grew older, he played his music for his mother, Mary
Rodgers Guettel, also a composer, who is now the chairwoman of
Juilliard. She was a tough audience. ``She would say, `That's not a
melody,''' Guettel recalled with affection.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, as Guettel has become more comfortable in his own
voice, he said, his appreciation for his grandfather's gift has
deepened. ``He was able to encode his melodies with essential
emotional information about character, about mood and desire,''
Guettel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I try to work in this work, the more I am awed by
what he did. It's so clean and confident and instinctive and
loving.'' He continued, ``It has the sound of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Guettel also said he envied the mass appeal of his grandfather's
music. Yet given that a more traditional composer like Frank
Wildhorn currently has three shows on Broadway, Guettel faces a
difficult climb in commercial terms. In addition to writing
sophisticated harmonies, he tackles unorthodox subjects like
abortion and spirituality. ``Floyd Collins'' is based on the true
story of a man trapped in a Kentucky cave in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Sondheim says Guettel's music is not unapproachable; it is
simply unfamiliar and unexpected. ``People have lazy ears,''
Sondheim said. ``With so much stuff in the theater, before the song
is over you know where it's going. That's not true of Adam. He is
full of surprise. The surprise is seldom arbitrary. It's usually
inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Guettel's music, people often mention Stravinsky,
Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein, composers whose music initially
took some getting used to. Reviewing ``Saturn Returns'' in The New
York Times, Stephen Holden wrote: ``The unifying element of
Guettel's music is a transcendent overarching melodic gift that
envelops and gives order to the often clashing inner voices of his
songs. His finest compositions have long-lined melodies that seem
to go on and on as they reach for the moon and stars, pivoting on
offbeat chromatic harmonies that are as unpredictable as they are
unabashedly romantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Guettel said he did not set out to be original. ``I'm trying to
represent the characters as I understand them and further the
story,'' he said. ``I don't care if I write the most conventional
music. It's something that may not be understood about what I'm
doing.'' He continued, ``That melody really is my main concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Adam started learning piano when he was 4 and wrote his
first piece at 8, scratching into the ivory keys which notes to
start on. He started singing as a soloist at the Metropolitan Opera
and the City Opera when he was 10, in productions like ``The Magic
Flute'' and ``Pelleas et Melisande,'' often missing classes at the
Collegiate School. He said his grandfather faithfully came to see
him in these productions.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Yale University in 1987, Guettel's first
major project was the music for ``The Legend of Oedipus,'' an epic
retelling of the Oedipus story directed by Nikos Psacharopoulos,
who ran the Williamstown Theater Festival. He wrote music for
documentary films and started writing ``Floyd Collins'' in 1992,
when he began to focus on theater. ``I loved it,'' Guettel said.
``I thought it was the hardest thing I'd ever tried doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's concert, presented by Nonesuch in association
with the Public Theater, will feature pieces from Guettel's work in
progress, a new musical based on the novella ``The Light in the
Piazza,'' a love story by Elizabeth Spencer. The show's book is by
Alfred Uhry.
</P>
<P>
   Tina Landau, a director and writer who met Guettel at Yale and
has collaborated with him on several projects, said working with
him is consuming and sometimes arduous because he creates a
cohesive musical vocabulary before he begins to write a note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike some composers, who will map out where the songs are
going to be and then start writing individual pieces, Adam will
spend months, years, whatever it takes on finding the right
vernacular for the piece as a whole,'' said Ms. Landau, who
directed and wrote the book for ``Floyd Collins.'' ``He won't move
ahead unless he feels he has reinvented some landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   While Guettel seems confident in his own work and his passion
for it, he is less sure of whether musical theater can remain
culturally relevant and commercially viable. In the world of his
grandfather, ``the idea of someone singing a song, an emotion being
pressed into metaphor, was acceptable to the larger public,''
Guettel said. ``And things have changed. The idea of someone
expressing themselves in that way, live, is not as natural a thing
and is much more difficult to put over. It feels like an impossible
chasm between what he did, getting his music out into the world,
and what I've done and hope to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``When I talk about that, I can feel sad. Not by
comparison, but because I want to give people something beautiful.
And it's kind of a hard business.''

 &HT;    Mount Everest climbers telephone LBJ students
 &HT;    By Dick Stanley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mockingbirds were chorusing Tuesday at LBJ High
School in Northeast Austin while landscapers trimmed the campus's
trees.
</P>
<P>
   But students of LBJ's Science Academy were in a different world.
They were paying rapt attention to the words of some climbers who
were pinned down by a blizzard, 20,833 feet high on Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are definitely getting homesick and ready to go home,''
climber Jacek Maselko, a 1989 LBJ graduate, told the students via
satellite telephone. ``But we go on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here are on pins and needles,'' Jackson Pace,
Maselko's former science teacher at LBJ, told him. Pace is
coordinating the students' share in the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Saegert, 15, shook her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm not there freezing,'' Saegert said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Baden, 16, agreed but added, ``I think they're handling it
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Maselko, 29, is a professional guide for an Alaska
mountaineering company on his first attempt to join the more than
1,000 people who have reached the summit of the world's highest
mountain, without joining the more than 140 who have lost their
lives in the process.
</P>
<P>
   There were fears Tuesday that the toll would go higher. Some in
a group of Ukrainian climbers _ one of 23 commercial or private
groups ascending the Himalayan mountain this spring _ may have died
in the unexpected snowstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago this month, 12 adventurers lost their lives in a
similar storm on what climbers call the Big E, whose 29,028-foot
summit is the roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Maselko said the storm Monday had forced his group of 12,
including seven clients who paid $15,000 each for the climb, to
come down from a camp at 27,230 feet, delaying their attempt at the
summit until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very iffy,'' Maselko told the students. ``But we hope to
summit'' on Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the mountain, Eric Brown, a 1990 LBJ graduate who
lives in Austin, is managing the group's base camp. But conditions
there aren't much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a very inviting place,'' Brown told the students on
the phone. ``You put your mind to it (while) your body is saying,
'No, no.' (The climbers) will be pushing themselves to the limit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all be careful,'' Pace told the adventurers, ending the
conversation that was costing $2.81 a minute. ``We love you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Science Academy students, whose parents and friends are
helping pay the phone costs, applauded.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well on the other side of the world, Maselko and
Brown will visit LBJ to discuss their adventure. If all doesn't go
well, Pace will have lost a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``At any moment,'' he said, ``things could turn bad there. Which
has concerned me about involving the kids. But this is a
once-in-a-lifetime story for them.''

A CENTURY OF PIANO THAT CAN LAST FOR WEEKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it possible to sum up the vast recorded legacy of the piano?
One answer has begun to arrive in recent months. Philips has been
releasing the first volumes of Great Pianists of the 20th Century,
which it says is the largest recording project ever.
</P>
<P>
   It may well be: so far, 60 two-CD volumes have been released,
and when all 100 volumes become available by the end of October,
they will include 15,006 minutes of music. If that number is a
little difficult to comprehend, you might do the math this way:
figuring on a 35-hour-per-week listening schedule, which allows
time off for lunch and weekends, you would need nearly two months
to hear everything.
</P>
<P>
   And what do we learn? This is the $2,000 question, that, more or
less, being the cost of all 100 volumes. Has the quality of piano
performance _ the level of invention, spontaneity, rhythmic
suppleness and so on _ declined during the century, as critics
sometimes say? Has technique become an end in itself, and
homogeneity replaced once distinct national styles? Is there even
such a thing as a national school?
</P>
<P>
   If anything in the history of piano recordings can be said to
have an official stamp, this is it. Twenty-five competing record
companies (including EMI, BMG/RCA, Decca/London, Sony and Deutsche
Grammophon) are contributing to it. Tom Deacon of Philips is the
producer; Steinway is the sponsor. Alfred Brendel was one of the
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   A little carping seems in order at the start. The project is
clearly a device for the re-release of a large number of back
catalog items and for the release of a small amount (less than two
hours) of previously recorded but unpublished material, all of it
meant to be given a boost under the rubric of Great Pianists.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 74 pianists included, Artur Schnabel gets one volume,
Brendel three; Dinu Lipatti and Rachmaninoff get one each, Claudio
Arrau three. Odd, no? Arrau and Brendel, by the way, are both on
the Philips label.
</P>
<P>
   More? Glenn Gould's single volume includes no Bach, while
Rosalyn Tureck, playing only Bach, gets two volumes. And so neither
of Gould's familiar versions of Bach's ``Goldberg'' Variations is
here, but there is Ms. Tureck's version of it and a version in a
volume devoted to Maria Yudina, a little-known Soviet-era pianist
of virtuous character and eccentric musicality whose inclusion
among the greats of the century is one of the curiosities of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   Among the pianists who did not make the cut are Ferruccio
Busoni, Simon Barere, Moriz Rosenthal, Heinrich Neuhaus, Alexander
Goldenweiser, Magda Tagliaferro, Jacques Fevrier, Carl Friedberg,
Samuel Feinberg, Mark Hambourg, Percy Grainger, Emil von Sauer _
shall we go on? _ Egon Petri, Guiomar Novaes, Alexander Brailowsky,
Vlado Perlemuter, Mieczyslaw Horszowski, Richard Goode, Peter
Serkin, Vladimir de Pachmann, Paul Badura-Skoda and Garrick
Ohlsson. I could add two other pianist-composers, as well, Grieg
and Saint-Saens.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's choices would differ, of course, though some of the
omissions seem careless or obtuse, not to mention biased against
artists who did not leave enough recorded music to fill a two-CD
set. And specific selections of recordings aren't easily explained
away. They may cause you to wonder just how much they were affected
by the desire to push recordings that aren't current sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Gould minus Bach is, in fact, defensible, because we may judge
his musicianship freshly, for better and worse, by hearing him play
Byrd (gloriously) and Mozart (disgracefully). But what about
performances that are clearly inferior to versions of the same
works recorded by the same artists?
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Cortot's performance of Schumann's ``Kreisleriana'' is an
example. The discographic information in the volume indicates that
it is his 1935 recording of the work, but it isn't: Philips
(without meaning to?) has published a different recording,
previously unreleased and, from the sound of it, evidently made
during the 1950s, when Cortot was close to 80 and declining.
</P>
<P>
   It is an interesting document but a bizarre error. His
performance of Ravel's ``Jeux d'Eau'' in the same volume,
incidentally, is also mistakenly dated: marked 1923, it's his 1931
recording.
</P>
<P>
   And there are other slapdash errors throughout the series. The
volume devoted to Paderewski includes a performance of Liszt's
famous F minor Etude, ``La Leggierezza,'' with an ending, according
to the album notes, ``revised by Benno Moiseiwitsch.'' In fact, the
recording is by Moiseiwitsch, not Paderewski, and the ending is by
Theodor Leschetizky, Moiseiwitsch's teacher, not by Moiseiwitsch.
</P>
<P>
   But enough complaining: let's just say that despite its flaws,
Great Pianists is a vast, valuable trove of piano recordings, and
among other things, it reminds us of many midcentury artists, like
Clara Haskil, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Wilhelm Kempff,
William Kapell, Clifford Curzon and Friedrich Gulda, who are no
longer familiar enough to a general audience.
</P>
<P>
   The Romanian-born Haskil, for example, a student of Cortot at
the turn of the century, a woman of catastrophic health who fled
the Nazis, began to achieve the success she deserved only shortly
before she died in 1960. She has always had more of a following in
Europe than in the United States. The two volumes devoted to her in
Great Pianists feature Mozart, Schubert and Schumann, and should
rectify whatever discrepancy exists in her status on the two sides
of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a more humane performance on record of Schubert's
Sonata in B flat, neither of its sublime slow movement nor of the
last movement, which gallops, all buoyancy and wit.
</P>
<P>
   Curzon's Schubert is slightly foursquare by comparison with
Haskil's but a paragon of seriousness and proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Michelangeli, like Curzon, was a cultish figure of the third
quarter of the century, the two of them nearly opposite in style.
Michelangeli's version of Ravel's ``Gaspard de la Nuit'' is
hypnotic, a model of his pianism, astonishing in its variety of
colors and sonorities, and as such, reflecting an approach to the
music that is less analytic than Romantic, which is to say less
modern and more connected to the sensibilities of the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gulda, the singular Viennese pianist and sometime
saxophonist, who made his name in the 1950s playing Bach and
Beethoven, increasingly devoting himself after that to jazz. One of
his two volumes includes Beethoven's Concerto in C, the four Chopin
ballades and George Shearing's ``Lullaby of Birdland'' _ soup to
nuts, musically speaking _ and you hear him listening, thinking,
making decisions in the process, which is how music ought to be
made.
</P>
<P>
   (``Lullaby of Birdland'' is the only jazz I noticed in the
series, not counting Andre Previn's performances of Gershwin.
Perhaps we should have added Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson to the
list of pianists not included.)
</P>
<P>
   As to the volumes devoted to giants like Vladimir Horowitz,
Arthur Rubinstein, Rachmaninoff and Lipatti (and also, judging by
the list of recordings for his album, which has not yet been
released, Leopold Godowsky), suffice it to say that they are solid
introductions for anyone who doesn't already own their recordings.
</P>
<P>
   I'll just note that the Paderewski album, notwithstanding the
Moiseiwitsch slip-up and despite the fact that he recorded after
his peak years, demonstrates in several Chopin etudes what it means
to have tremendous sensibility and a big heart.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to stress dead pianists. Music critics sometimes
bemoan the evolution of piano performance in this century, as if
pianists used to have soul and have increasingly become machines.
The supposed decline is attributed partly to technology, editing
equipment now permitting recording companies to produce technically
flawless performances that have altered the public's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Partly the decline is fixed on what you might call the industry
of the music conservatories and piano competitions, and partly on a
shift in approach to performance as performance has been divorced
from composition. The great pianists from Mozart through
Rachmaninoff were composers. Increasingly, they're specialists. And
the result is said to be a loss of spontaneity and originality.
</P>
<P>
   This view betrays, I think, a morose nostalgia, and Great
Pianists shows why. Four versions of Beethoven's Sonata in C minor
(Op. 111), for example, have been released in the series so far _
Schnabel's, Sviatoslav Richter's, Wilhelm Backhaus' and Stephen
Kovacevich's _ and conventional wisdom would dictate that the best
performance is one of the older ones: Schnabel's or Richter's or
Backhaus'.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the youngest player, Kovacevich, who leaves the lasting
impression. His performance is exact and melancholic at the start,
unfolding organically, coherently, with a tender Arietta that ends
up heaven-storming. Richter, a genius, in this live performance
sounds uncharacteristically uncooked. Backhaus is stolid.
Schnabel's version, one of several he left on disk, lurches. It's
sloppy, even for him.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Kovacevich, Radu Lupu, Andras Schiff, Martha Argerich
and Mitsuko Uchida are all among the active performers in this
series who belie the lazy cliche of a decline in pianistic
sensibility. Ms. Argerich plays too fast and aggressively at times,
but her interpretations of Bach, Liszt, Rachmaninoff and Chopin on
these disks are solid and long-lined: an exemplar of modern
pianism.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, a volume devoted to Van Cliburn shows why he was so
widely embraced even before he became a cold war celebrity. He
performs warhorses like Rachmaninoff's Concerto in D minor with an
astonishing delicacy and soulfulness. Rachmaninoff's B flat minor
Sonata, a crazy, sprawling work in Horowitz's frenetic accounts, in
Cliburn's hands becomes a moving, cogent minor masterpiece of late
Romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   Cliburn is a modern player, though I might add that his
honey-colored sound is a link to Arthur Friedheim, the Russian-born
student of Liszt, who taught Cliburn's mother, who taught him.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogy is sometimes deceptive. Lipatti was a Cortot pupil,
and are there two more diametrically opposite pianists in the 20th
century? Still, knowing a pianist's particular pedagogical lineage
can be useful, more so than relying on vague categories like
national schools. Listen, for example, to the recordings in this
series of Vladimir Ashkenazy, Horowitz and Richter and you'll see
why the conventional notion of a Russian school is nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Ashkenazy, a pianist of moderation and laser precision, studied
at the Moscow Conservatory with Lev Oborin. Oborin was a different
kind of musician from Heinrich Neuhaus, who taught Richter and also
Lupu, the Romanian pianist. Richter's and Lupu's renderings of
Beethoven sonatas, several of which are included on these disks,
have more in common _ call it a certain ponderous, strong-willed
physicality _ than Richter has in common stylistically with either
Ashkenazy or Horowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Their only link, you might say, is that they are all virtuosos
of one sort or another, true virtuosity having little to do with
note-perfection or speedy hands. It describes artists in this
series like Myra Hess, Solomon and Edwin Fischer no less than it
does pyrotechnicians like Josef Hofmann, Evgeny Kissin and
Moisewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   I return, finally, to Moisewitsch, because he was a great
character, a modern virtuoso, increasingly forgotten: a
Russian-born pupil of Leschetizky's, a warm, funny man who
developed a reputation among his friends in London, where he had
settled, for being a deadpan cardsharp, he died in 1963, at 73, a
beloved figure in England.
</P>
<P>
   At the keyboard he played with Olympian ease, exquisite taste
and a radiant tone. During Lincoln Center's recent series ``Great
Pianists of the 20th Century on Film,'' he gave a jaw-dropping
traversal of Liszt's transcription of Wagner's ``Tannhauser''
Overture, a bombastic work of herculean difficulty, which he
disposed of without sweat, seated quietly, as if reading the
morning newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   His single volume in the Philips series is a serious
contribution to the discography, because most of the music has not
previously been available on CD. It includes Chopin _ the
Barcarolle and a suave reading of the Scherzo in E _ along with
Rachmaninoff, Liszt and others, all of it smooth as silk.
</P>
<P>
   In his case, I could have stood a second volume, maybe including
his 1938 recording of the Wagner-Liszt overture, his Beethoven
Third Piano Concerto, his Schumann Fantasie and his performance of
Tausig's arrangement of Weber's ``Invitation to a Dance,'' which, I
gather, is terrific.
</P>
<P>
   There is an excellent Moiseiwitsch disk from Pearl, the finest
producer of old piano recordings, which, besides the overture,
includes the Mendelssohn Concerto in G minor and Brahms' Variations
and Fugue on a Theme of Handel; neither of them is here. And I was
bothered, once again, that much of the discographic information in
the existing volume is incomplete and careless. And _ I am
quibbling again.
</P>
<P>
   But, after all, what is the point of a collection of the
greatest hits of the century if not to give know-it-alls something
to complain about into the next century?

IBM TO MAKE GAME PART FOR NINTENDO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underscoring the growing significance of inexpensive video game
machines in the computer industry, IBM Corp. and Nintendo Inc. plan
to announce Wednesday a $1 billion agreement for Nintendo to build
its next-generation system with IBM's PowerPC processors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the PowerPC chip has been best known as the processor
that powers the Macintosh line of computers from Apple Computer
Inc. The deal is something of a coup for IBM, which will gain a
coveted foothold in a booming market being fiercely contested by
three Japanese giants _ Nintendo, Sony Corp. and Sega Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the computer industry predict that powerful game
machines from the three companies will begin taking on a wide
variety of computing tasks in their next generation, including
Internet communications and music and video entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And because the business model for video games uses software
sales to subsidize the cost of hardware, the machines are almost
certain to cost less than even the least expensive personal
computers. What is more, by some measurements, they will outperform
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Nintendo and IBM refused to comment Tuesday, but
people close to the deal said the companies planned an announcement
at the E3 video game convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would also serve to revitalize IBM's beleaguered
PowerPC business, which was founded as a great strategic alliance
with Apple and Motorola Corp. in 1991, but has languished.
</P>
<P>
   Although the venture was originally intended to provide an
alternative hardware standard to processors made by Intel Corp.,
bureaucratic squabbling and the failure to bring several
next-generation operating systems to market undercut the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with Nintendo, IBM will make a custom
400-megahertz PowerPC microprocessor for a new Nintendo game
machine, scheduled for worldwide introduction in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The chip, which will be made using IBM's currently most advanced
manufacturing process, will be paired with a high-performance
graphics chip being designed by Wei Yen, a former computer designer
from Silicon Graphics Inc., people close to the agreement said. Yen
leads a small computer graphics design firm, ArtX Inc., based in
Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Nintendo PowerPC chip will permit the game machine to
display realistic three-dimensional images and will be a source of
rivalry between Nintendo and Sony, which last month began
demonstrating its Playstation II.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony system is built around a high-performance graphics
processor that Sony is now designing with Toshiba Corp. The two
companies are investing as much as $2 billion in a new
semiconductor manufacturing plant to produce integrated circuits
for the game system, which is expected to go on sale in Japan later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Sony and Nintendo threatens to eclipse Sega,
which has built its Dreamcast machine around an alliance with
Microsoft Corp. The Sega system, which is now being sold in Japan,
has graphics processing power that is better than the current
systems, but it will be no match for new systems planned by Sony
and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the video game business, which will have sales
this year that surpass Hollywood's box office revenue, have led
both Nintendo and Sony to pre-announce their machines to build
enthusiasm, particularly among the software developers who supply
crucial titles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sony will begin selling its machines later this year in
Japan, the actual war for dominance of the next generation of video
game players will not take place until Christmas 2000. That is when
consumers will have a choice of machines that will offer remarkably
lifelike game experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations given by Sony officials earlier this year
suggested that the new game systems would be able to match the
visual effects seen in computer-animated movies like ``Toy Story,''
while at the same time allowing players to have interactive control
over the characters on the screen.

CEO SUPPORT GROUP PROVIDES FORUM FOR NONBIASED COUNSEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Take it from Deb Turpin: It is lonely at the
top.
</P>
<P>
   Turpin, founder and chief executive of River City Studio, is a
visible and honored small-business leader in Kansas City. She is
chairwoman of the Metropolitan Entrepreneurs Council of the Greater
Kansas City Chamber of Commerce. She won the 1999 Advertising
Executive of the Year award from the Ad Club of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's the first to admit she doesn't have all the answers _
or even all the questions. So, once a month, she leaves her graphic
design business for a day to meet with a small group of fellow
CEOs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City area, four such groups meet monthly under the
TEC umbrella. TEC, formerly known as The Executive Committee, was
founded in 1957 as an educational forum for company presidents and
business owners.
</P>
<P>
   TEC is an organization, said group convener Tony Lewis, ``where
members go to get their answers questioned.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is chairwoman of two of the four areawide TEC groups
meeting in the Kansas City region. Joe Edwards, based in Leawood,
Kan., is chairman of another TEC group, which includes Turpin. Ted
Davis, based in Leavenworth, Kan., is chairman of a fourth TEC
group.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen members is considered to be the optimum size for TEC
groups, and all the organizers say they can handle more members.
</P>
<P>
   The three Kansas City area conveners help plan meetings and
advise TEC members. Membership, which is by invitation, is aimed at
CEOs of companies with $3 million or more in annual sales and 25 or
more employees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to learning from her peers, Turpin said, ``Probably
the most valuable thing about TEC is that it makes me accountable
to someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the CEO, I'm not held accountable to anyone within my own
organization. I am held accountable to my TEC group. We give each
other honest, and sometimes brutal, advice. ... It's better than
having a board of directors.''
</P>
<P>
   Participant Joe Lawson said one of TEC's values was that ``it
costs less than hiring a consultant _ and the results come from
folks who do know what they are talking about, not from folks who
talk about what they probably haven't done.''
</P>
<P>
   TEC membership costs $825 a month, payable quarterly, which
works out to nearly $10,000 a year. Members say it's worth it,
given the value of information exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The international TEC organization provides printed and Web site
educational materials and recommends expert speakers. Typical TEC
meetings feature a speaker for half a day and a closed-door,
no-holds-barred discussion among peers for the other half. Topics
range from business to personal.
</P>
<P>
   Groups rotate meetings among their members' work sites or
occasionally hotels if a CEO's business doesn't have a conference
room to hold the group.
</P>
<P>
   The format, said participant Bob Cutler, provides ``a nonbiased
forum'' for second-guessing the kinds of questions and answers that
land on a CEO's desk. Cutler said he saved much time and money by
drawing on other CEOs' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find there's a lot of value for the dollars invested,''
agreed participant Bob Niles. Furthermore, he said, the meetings
offer CEO-level training and education that can be difficult to
find.
</P>
<P>
   Each TEC group is organized on a principle similar to many
breakfast clubs _ only one CEO from a particular kind of business
is allowed in a group. So a group couldn't have two CEOs of mutual
fund companies, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a CEO can't join a TEC group that already has a
chief executive from a company with which he or she does business,
competes or has any other kind of relationship.
</P>
<P>
   That policy keeps the give-and-take sessions confidential and
eliminates conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Participants say they are religious about attending sessions
because of the value they think they get from and give to one
another. It's also good discipline, Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a CEO says they do not have time for this or anything else
in their lives, then they are probably not in control of their
time, and the business is thus managing them,'' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
   Turpin, who founded her business backed by a fine-arts degree
and no business training, said TEC was her business professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing I find is that a day away from the day-to-day
operations and phone calls really is important,'' she said. ``(It)
helps clear my head so I can have the opportunity to think about
the big picture, rather than always be immersed in the small
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   For further information about TEC groups in the Kansas City
area, call Joe Edwards at 491-0030, Ted Davis at (913) 682-2589 or
Tony Lewis at 587-6499.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the organization also is available from TEC
headquarters in San Diego at (800) 274-2367 or tec &LR; tecceo.com. The
organization's Web site is http://www.tecceo.com

DISMISSING WORD OF TROOP WITHDRAWAL, NATO CONTINUES BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>

(rm) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS with MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Undeterred by calls from China and Russia to halt
the bombing, American and allied forces pounded targets across
Yugoslavia on Tuesday as NATO leaders vowed to continue the air war
until President Slobodan Milosevic agreed to meet all of their
demands.
</P>
<P>
   After relatively quiet nights of bombing following the strike on
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade late Friday night, NATO aircraft
hit 37 targets overnight on Monday and, with clearing skies,
pressed their attack virtually without pause through the day and
night Tuesday, American and NATO officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffing Yugoslavia's announcement that it had begun
withdrawing Army and police units from Kosovo, NATO warned that it
would continue attacking those forces, even those that might be
retreating, until Milosevic agreed to remove all of his troops and
allow hundreds of thousands of Albanian refugees to return to their
homes under the protection of an international force.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Brussels and here in Washington said there was no
evidence that any Yugoslav forces had left the province, dismissing
the announcement as a ploy by Milosevic to capitalize on the
international outrage over the bombing of China's embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number one, we have seen no evidence of any partial pullout,''
Secretary of Defense William Cohen told members of the Senate's
Appropriations Committee Tuesday. ``Number two, a partial pullout
would mean a total victory for him. A partial pullout is not
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomatic efforts to end the NATO bombardment remained mired in
the political fallout from NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy.
Russia's special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, who had been trying to
play peacemaker before the embassy attack, met with China's top
leaders in Beijing Tuesday and offered no real sign of progress.
</P>
<P>
   China repeated its insistence that NATO stop the bombing before
any negotiations for a peace settlement could begin. While
Chernomyrdin said he still supported peace proposals reached last
week in Germany that linked a bombing pause to verifiable evidence
of Serbian troop withdrawal, he also called for a halt to the NATO
bombing while in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   After the embassy bombing, China suspended its cooperation with
the United States on several fronts, including its military
contacts, which the Clinton administration has tried to cultivate.
The Pentagon announced Tuesday that China had suspended a visit by
the commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Charles Krulak, and a trip
by Cohen, now scheduled for June, appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said Tuesday that the Chinese government was taking
advantage of a mistake that the United States and NATO had
acknowledged. He cited the fact that Chinese media only today
reported President Clinton's apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between righteous indignation and
calculated exploitation,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly seven weeks into NATO's air war, Yugoslavia's government
announced on Monday that it had begun to withdraw some of its
troops, saying they were no longer needed because it had defeated
the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials did not say how many of its approximately
40,000 troops in or near Kosovo would be leaving, but some
suggested the withdrawal could occur more quickly if NATO refrained
from bombing the retreating columns on the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav officials also said that they were ultimately
prepared to shrink their force in Kosovo to the ``peacetime''
level. It was unclear whether they were referring to troop levels
before the bombing began or those set in a cease-fire in October
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at NATO and at the Pentagon derided the announcement,
saying that it would leave Yugoslavia with a force of almost 30,000
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something which allows 10,000 troops to go home while the
other 30,000 get on with business as usual in Kosovo is not
something that we are prepared to aid and abet in any way,'' NATO's
spokesman, Jamie Shea, said Tuesday. ``President Milosevic has to
take all of his forces out.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officials here in Washington said Tuesday that intelligence
reports indicated Serbian-led forces continued to mount at least
small- scale operations against ethnic Albanian rebel fighters and
civilians. Over the weekend, the Yugoslav forces resumed using
helicopters and flying at least some of their aircraft, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces have dispersed and dug into defensive positions,
particularly along the rugged valley that runs north from
Macedonia, evidently in preparation for the possibility of a NATO
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that Yugoslavia takes seriously reports that NATO's
planners might someday consider an invasion from Hungary, too, the
Army has reportedly begun reinforcing positions along a defensive
line north of Novi Sad, in the province of Vojvodina, one senior
defense official said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's campaign entered its 49th day, there was no easing of
the bombing. Throughout the day American and allied aircraft _
including American B-1's, B-2s, B-52s, F-117 ``stealth'' attack
jets and the whole array of fighters _ criss-crossed the skies over
Yugoslavia. They struck radio and television towers, oil storage
tanks, bridges and an Army barracks in Cacak, officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's strikes followed an intensive night which included at
least one strike in Belgrade, an army barracks at Mount Avala, the
officials said. It was the first strike in the capital since the
bombing of the embassy, but officials strongly denied that there
had been any change in the attack plans because of the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, explosions again rocked the edges of Belgrade,
and new strikes were reported in Pancevo, the industrial city whose
oil facilities have been been repeatedly struck by NATO warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest strikes, officials reported having success against
tanks, artillery and other armored forces in Kosovo, though they
acknowledged that taking out those forces was difficult and
painstakingly slow, especially since many are now well hidden,
taking advantage of natural features like forests and caves, as
well as man-made tunnels and bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   After seven weeks of bombardment, officials here say the forces
in Kosovo are clearly suffering, especially from the shortage of
fuel, which has been reduced to a relative trickle. One official
said the forces ``are in fuel extremis.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are few signs they are ready to break. ``They're
dispersing themselves very well,'' a senior defense official said.
``They have prepared defensive measures.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Yugoslavia's claims to have vanquished Kosovo's rebels,
Pentagon and NATO officials said that Yugoslav troops have been
pressing their attacks against rebel strongholds in the region.
They said there was fighting in the north, particularly along the
roads from Pristina to Podujevo and Mitrovica. There have also been
skirmishes in central Kosovo and near the Albanian border. NATO
officials said that the Kosovo Liberation Army was very active
inside Kosovo but was suffering heavy casualties. A Kosovo
Liberation Army representative in Kukes, Albania, near the Kosovo
border, said today that the rebel army command in Kosovo had seen
``absolutely no evidence of a withdrawal'' of Yugoslav forces.

COMMENTARY: THE COLDEST CUT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jesse Jackson detected slights.
</P>
<P>
   When he got the three POWs out of Slobodan Milosevic's grasp and
back to the safety of Ramstein Air Base in Germany, he and his
contingent of religious leaders expected a hot meal. Not just cold
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gentle reader, this will not surprise you, but Jacksonians have
been keeping a dis list. They feel the insults have been
orchestrated by Clinton hawks livid that Jackson got out ``our
boys,'' as he calls them, and added to the pressure on the
administration to rethink its wobbly war.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson crowd felt they had not been met at the air base by
a U.S. official of sufficient stature.
</P>
<P>
   And, most egregiously for the camera-loving preacher, when
Jackson made his triumphal return and met with the president, the
White House allowed only a few still photographers into the room.
There were no TV cameras rolling.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't even the Oval Office where Jackson wasn't getting
on TV. This came after the White House kept the reverend cooling
his heels for about an hour in the Roosevelt Room while Viktor
Chernomyrdin was shuttled between the vice president and president.
And that shifty Russian did get into the Oval Office!
</P>
<P>
   When the president met at the White House Tuesday with business
leaders, and flew them to Atlanta to talk about enhancing private
investment in inner cities and poor rural areas, he did not invite
his spiritual adviser, the man who prayed with the president,
Hillary and Chelsea to help them heal after you-know-what. This
even though Jackson was the one who started the effort to get CEO's
to invest in poor communities.
</P>
<P>
   The administration stewed about Jackson's Belgrade free-lancing
endangering U.S. policy. But a policy as addled as this one doesn't
need Jesse Jackson to mess it up. The CIA, or ``Can't Identify
Anything,'' as Jay Leno calls it, doesn't even know where the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is. You can probably get that
information on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Albright must have been steamed at all the jokes about
Jackson being the de facto secretary of state. After all, there had
already been so much talk about Sandy Berger being the de facto
secretary of state. At the White House correspondents dinner, Brian
Williams, the MSNBC anchor who was acting as M.C., teased Ms.
Albright, ``How about that Jesse Jackson?''
</P>
<P>
   The notoriously thin-skinned Madame Secretary sought to turn
things around by giving Time magazine unusual access to her Balkan
negotiations. She is on this week's cover with a cell phone and a
flygirl bomber jacket. The 10-page rhapsody to ``Madeleine's War''
includes etudes in black and white by turn portraying her as tough
but tender, oh so lonely at the top but cozy enough to kibitz over
a hand of presidential hearts on Air Force One. Take that, Jesse!
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House has had great success inflaming
egotistical politicians with calculated slights. When Newt Gingrich
did not get enough attention from Clinton on the flight home from
Yitzhak Rabin's funeral, he petulantly, and disastrously, shut down
the government.
</P>
<P>
   But you have to be careful about whose pique you pique.
Jackson's poll numbers have shot up since his Belgrade derring-do,
and the White House could provoke him _ death by a thousand cold
cuts _ into the presidential race. This would be perverse, given
the effort Al Gore has expended wooing Jackson out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   In the '88 primary, the reverend had great fun tormenting the
stolid, gaffe-prone Gore. When Gore said, in a debate in New York,
that he understood racism because as a child he had visited a house
in the South that had remnants of slave days, Jackson supporters
howled.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was kind about Gore's lackluster start for 2000. ``I
have lots of respect for him,'' he said in a telephone interview.
But he added something that should make Gore shiver: ``And for Bill
Bradley.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said ``Run, Jesse, Run'' e-mails had flooded his Chicago
office. ``The phones have not stopped ringing,'' he said, sounding
pleased but not persuaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he says, ``I'm not going to yield to that
temptation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson uses the words ``now'' and ``temptation,'' his
subtext for the White House is clear: Lose the cold cuts.

DEFENDANT CONVICTED IN KILLING OF CLAIRE-MARIE MONTI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Three times as juror Mike Bradley left the
Johnson County, Kan., Courthouse last week, he thought that he had
heard the worst about the murder of Claire-Marie Monti. But the
evidence in Rodney Wayne Henry's murder trial kept getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   First, there were the photos of the Lenexa hotel room where
Monti was sexually abused and murdered. The next day, the eight
women and four men on the jury had to stare at poster-sized photos
of Monti's injuries. The worst, Bradley said, was when prosecutors
played a videotape of Henry detailing how Monti was attacked and
murdered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was traumatic,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the jurors found Henry, 25, guilty of first-degree
murder, rape and aggravated criminal sodomy. Judge Peter Ruddick
will hear post-trial motions July 15 and might sentence Henry then.
The mandatory sentence is life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Morrison said he hasn't decided whether
to ask for a ``hard 40'' sentence, which would keep Henry from
being paroled for at least 40 years, but he will ask that Henry
serve more than the minimum 25 years before parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure he's a very old man before he sees a
parole board,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Monti, a 32-year-old computer trainer from
suburban Philadelphia, was in Johnson County for a job in April
1998 when she met Henry and Carl Dean Rails at a Westport bar. The
three went to Monti's Lenexa hotel, and the men attacked her when
she refused a sexual advance, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's culpability came from the help he gave Rails during the
attack, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Rails is charged with capital murder. Prosecutors and defense
lawyers don't expect his trial to begin until fall or winter.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said he doesn't plan to offer Henry a sentencing deal
in exchange for testimony in Rails' trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very, very careful about negotiating with criminals and
turning them into witnesses,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Rails.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Henry told the court that he held Monti's arms behind
her back while Rails pummeled her. He sobbed as he testified that
he was afraid of Rails and didn't know what to do during the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's breakdown didn't sway jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had a real hesitancy to place much faith or credibility
in the defendant's words,'' Bradley, the presiding juror, said
outside court. ``...A couple of the jurors noticed a lack of
physical tears, and there was some comment about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Monti's parents, Vic and Claire Monti, found the sobbing
insincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bawling not for Claire-Marie Monti, but because of the
situation he's in,'' Vic Monti said. ``I think he's crying because
he got caught.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury's main considerations were whether the murder was
premeditated and whether Monti was sexually assaulted before or
after she died. Henry could not have been convicted of the sex
crimes if Monti had been dead when the assault occurred.
</P>
<P>
   About 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, 3 hours into deliberations that began
Monday night, the jury asked to review Henry's confession and a
pathologist's testimony about Monti's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the videotaped confession, the jurors who had
been unsure when the sexual assault took place were certain that
Monti had still been alive, Bradley said. They didn't need a court
reporter to read back the pathologist's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The jury reached its verdicts by 10:20 a.m. Henry, clad in a
dark blue suit, rubbed his upper lip while he waited for jurors to
enter the courtroom. He looked at his lap as the verdicts were read
but showed little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   As Henry was led from the courtroom, he stopped and called
Morrison a liar until deputies tugged to get him to continue
walking down a hallway. Henry's mother sat silently in court for a
few minutes and declined to talk to a reporter as she walked out.
</P>
<P>
   Monti's parents, who flew in from Pennsylvania, were pleased
that the first murder case is drawing to a close, but they know
their ordeal is not over. They plan to return for Rails' trial, and
they know they'll hear much of the same traumatic testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the last thing I can do for my daughter,'' Claire Monti
said. ``There's nothing more I can do after that.''

IBM CLAIMS NEW DISC STORAGE CAPACITY RIVALS THAT OF SILICON CHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM plans to announce Wednesday that its researchers have set a
new record in magnetic-disc storage density, packing bits of data
in a space so small that 20 billion fit within a square inch.
</P>
<P>
   In standard measurements of disc-drive capacities, 20 billion
bits are the amount of data that can be stored on a 2.5 gigabyte
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough, by scientists and engineers at the company's
Almaden Research Laboratory in San Jose, Calif., promises to usher
in an era _ merely a few years off _ in which magnetic-disc storage
reach immense capacities.
</P>
<P>
   The advance is significant, said IBM researchers, because it
contrasts recent remarkable progress made by magnetic storage
systems with that of silicon memory chips, long the stars of
progress in computer technology.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the regular progress of silicon integrated
circuits _ doubling in density every 18 months since the late 1960s
_ has been the basic benchmark of the microelectronics world.
Indeed, the rate of that advance is known as Moore's Law for the
man who first observed it, Gordon Moore, a cofounder of Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, it appears that silicon is taking a back seat to
the world of magnetics. In just 17 months, IBM researchers have
doubled the data storage capacity of hard discs to 20 billion bits
a square inch, and it appears that they will stay on that track for
some time into the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been on a consistent faster ramp than the silicon
world,'' said John Best, vice president for technology for IBM's
storage division.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while disc drives have tended to shrink in size from
washing machine-sized appliances to today's tiny 1-inch miniature
systems, semiconductor chips have actually increased in size as
their density gains have trailed the magnetics industry.
</P>
<P>
   The latest breakthrough in discs is a research finding
significantly in advance of today's commercial disc drives. For
example, the company said, 20 billion bits a square inch is 3 1/2
times the top density of products currently available. IBM's
6.4-gigabyte Travelstar disc drive for portable computers packs 5.7
billion bits into each square inch.
</P>
<P>
   The new density would permit each square inch of disc space to
store 2.5 gigabytes _ equivalent to two TV-quality movies, two
hours of MPEG-2 digital video, the contents of almost four CD-ROMs
or the text of about 2,500 average-length novels.
</P>
<P>
   The rapidly increasing storage capacity is certain to transform
the market for computer disc drives and push the devices rapidly
into the consumer marketplace. Already two Silicon Valley
companies, Replay Networks Inc. and Tivo Inc., have begun selling
digital videocassette recorders that are powerful computers which
use disc drives instead of magnetic tape to store video images. The
largest Replay machine now stores about 26 hours of video images.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM scientists said they were pleased with the stability of
ultrasmall magnetic areas that store digital 1's and 0's. They said
that their ability to double disc capacity had largely derived from
engineering advances and from improvements in an ultrasensitive
magnetoresistive sensor, the technology used in the drive's
``head'' _ the component that reads data from the hard discs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991, when IBM introduced the industry's first
magnetoresistive head, data density has increased 60 percent a
year. Today's drives rely on a related device known as a gigantic
magnetoresistive head. The IBM scientists said that at the current
rate of progress, the 20 billion bit capacity will be available in
about three years.
</P>
<P>
   The first technical details of this demonstration will be
disclosed next week at the International Magnetics Conference in
Kyongju, South Korea.

U.N. AIDE TO MEET MILOSEVIC, ANGERING SOME

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. high commissioner for human rights is
to meet President Slobodan Milosevic this week to protest
Yugoslavia's human rights abuses, a meeting that caused some
surprise and consternation here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The planned meeting of the commissioner, Mary Robinson, received
a strong endorsement from Secretary-General Kofi Annan, however.
Fred Eckard, the secretary-general's spokesman, said Annan
``expects Mrs. Robinson to deliver a firm message in Belgrade
concerning abuses of human rights in the region.''
</P>
<P>
   But the trip has made several diplomatic missions uneasy. One
Western diplomat said, ``Asking President Milosevic to help correct
the human rights abuses taking place in his country is like asking
Dr. Kevorkian to supervise a geriatric clinic.''
</P>
<P>
   In a joint letter, Human Rights Watch and the Jacob Blaustein
Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights, which is affiliated
with the American Jewish Committee, asked Mrs. Robinson to cancel
the meeting, calling it a ``grave mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meeting with Milosevic at this stage _ as his campaign of
slaughter and forced displacement is raging in Kosovo _ risks
legitimizing a man who stand for the antithesis of the values you
have pledged to uphold,'' the letter said.

 IBM TO MAKE GAME PART FOR NINTENDO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 13th and 14th grafs, beginning: Michael Slater,(mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Underscoring the growing significance of inexpensive video game
machines in the computer industry, IBM Corp. and Nintendo Inc. plan
to announce Wednesday a $1 billion agreement for Nintendo to build
its next-generation system with IBM's PowerPC processors.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the PowerPC chip has been best known as the processor
that powers the Macintosh line of computers from Apple Computer
Inc. The deal is something of a coup for IBM, which will gain a
coveted foothold in a booming market being fiercely contested by
three Japanese giants _ Nintendo, Sony Corp. and Sega Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the computer industry predict that powerful game
machines from the three companies will begin taking on a wide
variety of computing tasks in their next generation, including
Internet communications and music and video entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   And because the business model for video games uses software
sales to subsidize the cost of hardware, the machines are almost
certain to cost less than even the least expensive personal
computers. What is more, by some measurements, they will outperform
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Nintendo and IBM refused to comment Tuesday, but
people close to the deal said the companies planned an announcement
at the E3 video game convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would also serve to revitalize IBM's beleaguered
PowerPC business, which was founded as a great strategic alliance
with Apple and Motorola Corp. in 1991, but has languished.
</P>
<P>
   Although the venture was originally intended to provide an
alternative hardware standard to processors made by Intel Corp.,
bureaucratic squabbling and the failure to bring several
next-generation operating systems to market undercut the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement with Nintendo, IBM will make a custom
400-megahertz PowerPC microprocessor for a new Nintendo game
machine, scheduled for worldwide introduction in the fall of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The chip, which will be made using IBM's currently most advanced
manufacturing process, will be paired with a high-performance
graphics chip being designed by Wei Yen, a former computer designer
from Silicon Graphics Inc., people close to the agreement said. Yen
leads a small computer graphics design firm, ArtX Inc., based in
Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Nintendo PowerPC chip will permit the game machine to
display realistic three-dimensional images and will be a source of
rivalry between Nintendo and Sony, which last month began
demonstrating its Playstation II.
</P>
<P>
   The Sony system is built around a high-performance graphics
processor that Sony is now designing with Toshiba Corp. The two
companies are investing as much as $2 billion in a new
semiconductor manufacturing plant to produce integrated circuits
for the game system, which is expected to go on sale in Japan later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry between Sony and Nintendo threatens to eclipse Sega,
which has built its Dreamcast machine around an alliance with
Microsoft Corp. The Sega system, which is now being sold in Japan,
has graphics processing power that is better than the current
systems, but it will be no match for new systems planned by Sony
and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Slater, editor of The Microprocessor Report, said,
however, that in the world of video game machines the capabilities
of the graphics processor, the chip that produces the actual images
on the screen, are more crucial than the set's microprocessor chip,
which carries out all the other instructions encoded in the game
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real performance comes from the specialized graphics
engines that perform 3-D operations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes in the video game business, which will have sales
this year that surpass Hollywood's box office revenue, have led
both Nintendo and Sony to pre-announce their machines to build
enthusiasm, particularly among the software developers who supply
crucial titles.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sony will begin selling its machines later this year in
Japan, the actual war for dominance of the next generation of video
game players will not take place until Christmas 2000. That is when
consumers will have a choice of machines that will offer remarkably
lifelike game experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations given by Sony officials earlier this year
suggested that the new game systems would be able to match the
visual effects seen in computer-animated movies like ``Toy Story,''
while at the same time allowing players to have interactive control
over the characters on the screen.

MY LUNCH WITH ANDRE (AND WALLY)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)``MY DINNER WITH ANDRE,'' directed by Louis Malle, was
a surprise success in 1981 and quickly became a cult movie
favorite: a virtuosic colloquy between two old friends whose wide
disparities were philosophical as well as personal.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner, Andre Gregory, an experimental theater director,
tells of his theatrical and spiritual adventures, and Wallace
Shawn, a playwright with a more sedentary approach to life, listens
in amazement while offering his own pithy comments. The interplay
is both amusing and poignant as each man searches for
self-expression.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the movie was shown as part of an archival series of
classic films at the Hamptons International Festival on Long
Island, and it has just been re-released, beginning with an
exclusive engagement at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in Manhattan. This
seemed a propitious time to bring the two together for another
conversation _ about the film, questions of art and reality, and
what has happened to them since that first ``Dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   I have known them both for many years, but this was the first
time the three of us had had lunch together. We met at Mesa Grill
on lower Fifth Avenue, a restaurant of Gregory's choice, and we all
ordered quail salad, a tribute to ``My Dinner With Andre,'' in
which they dined on quail. What follows is an edited version of my
lunch with Andre and Wally.
</P>
<P>
   At the festival in East Hampton, neither of them had watched the
entire movie. I had seen it again on television and said I was more
aware that they were acting, even though they were playing
characters based on themselves.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANDRE GREGORY. In the rehearsal process I was completely
floundering because I was trying to play myself as really me,
whatever that means. Once I could get a handle on myself as a
character, I actually started using four different voices. One was
the sort of Peter Brook guru voice. One was a kind of flaky
upper-middle-class, spoiled, off-the-wall voice. One was a kind of
religious fanatic who would sell out his best friend for
enlightenment. And the fourth was my sincere voice, which only
appeared toward the end of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   MEL GUSSOW. All are aspects of your personality?
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. Oh, but that's true of any role you play.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. But it's rare that anyone has four such contrasting
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. That's part of what's interesting about being a
character actor.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. You're both character actors, aren't you?
</P>
<P>
   WALLACE SHAWN. Well, that's not by choice. It's involuntary.
That's just due to the stupidity of the people who hire us.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. You would prefer to be a leading man?
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. In one's own life, one imagines oneself to be a leading
man, and we could easily be leading men if people made films of
different kinds.
</P>
<P>
   Could I comment on what Andre said? I couldn't watch the parts
of the film with me in it, but I watched the beginning where it's
mostly Andre talking. I was impressed by what a wonderful actor he
is, and what a wonderful director Louis is. But the character that
they settled on, this very manic figure who is a compulsive talker,
is not in any way what Andre Gregory ever was. Now maybe in his
head he's the fanatic or the guru dispensing wisdom, but in real
life he doesn't ever show those aspects, and he doesn't show that
driving need to dominate the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, it was the biggest trap that we had in rehearsal,
this danger of trying to be the way you really are. In my case, I
was much more confrontational and truculent than I would ever be in
life.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. At the time, you said you were ``determined to defend
myself against Andre and not to let him upset me,'' and that he was
determined to evoke a response from you. In a sense, that's the
storyline.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. That seems right, although with hindsight I might
redescribe our objectives today slightly more in terms of wanting
to be enlightened by the other. Each of us comes to the dinner, in
a way, hoping to be cracked by the other, particularly my
character.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. A very famous director who will remain nameless thought
the movie could only work if it was a man and a woman, probably
because there could be an undercurrent of flirtatiousness and
seductiveness. But I think it's a men's movie on one level because
one man has trouble articulating. The other guy just talks at him;
he doesn't really talk with him. So I see one line of the movie as
two men who are hidden: one through introversion, the other through
extroversion.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. In a sense, you could say I was getting ready to become a
little bit more like the character he plays, and maybe he was ready
to become slightly more like the better side of the character I
play. I had the intention of murdering the side of myself that was
shown in the film. Not that anyone would care, but that's the
secret story behind the story.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. If you were to remake the movie, could you play each
other's roles?
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. Well, we did think of a movie in which I would sort of go
berserk and he would be trying to calm me down. In a certain way,
``Vanya on 42d Street'' is that movie.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. I personally think that Wally is one of our great
actors. In ``My Dinner With Andre,'' he has an ability to do
something which, as an actor, I have great trouble with. In life,
I'm a great listener. When I'm acting, I'm a very bad listener
because I'm always so worried about my next response, or my cue. So
I'm not sure how good I would have been playing Wally's role, and
also, Wally's role is amazingly comedic. I would probably play him
more as a Jungian therapist.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. When Louis was alive, the idea of a sequel was never
totally out of the question, but I certainly didn't want to do it
unless it would be better than the first one. I had a picture of it
that would have been the opposite way from ``My Dinner With
Andre.'' I would have been talking about my experiences.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. Do you also think of your character as having different
aspects?
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. I suppose I conceived of it as starting off entirely in a
defensive mode, trying not to be upset by the somewhat anarchic
forces that are being unleashed at the dinner table and are
threatening to my complacency. Then later making a kind of
last-ditch protest and in a way giving in and allowing myself to be
affected by Andre. Louis had a much less satirical approach to both
of our characters than I did. Or at least he allowed the affection
that he felt for us personally to color his interpretation. He
painted a much warmer and more compassionate portrait of both of us
than if another person had directed the movie.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. How much free play of the imagination went into the
writing?
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. In a way, no free play of the imagination went into it.
The imagination was only in figuring out what the discussion was
going to be about and making it out of the pieces that were
available. There are some connective bits that string it all
together. But basically it's made up of fragments from the real
conversations, and certainly there are no stories or facts that are
made up out of my head _ except the dinner itself.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. Did you ever have a dinner or a lunch together before
you shot the movie?
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. That wasn't something that we ever did.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. Breaking old habits changed both of us: mine to listen,
yours to speak.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. It's a film about a couple of men making a stab at
intimacy, which remains quite a challenge for most men.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. A lot of people have described the experience of
watching the movie as being sort of trippy or druglike, which is
partly the speed at which we're talking, partly the amount of
imagery.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. That speed was driven by Louis. We both spoke in the
movie much faster than either of us really speak. It was an
inspired idea on Louis' part.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. Because the camera's in close-up, it can see lots of
things in me that I'm not even aware of. I was in a Peter Weir
movie and he actually burst out laughing in the middle of a take. I
said, ``What's so funny?'' And he said, ``The camera goes into
close-up and looks into your eyes and sees such depth of
existential terror, that it's just very funny.'' One thing for
sure: the movie sort of stopped me telling stories at dinner
parties. Because I love to tell stories, I did it compulsively.
When I was going through those things I talk about in the movie,
one of my best friends, a lawyer, took Chiquita (Gregory's wife,
who died in 1992) out to lunch and suggested that I be
hospitalized. I also think the character in the movie has reached a
real impasse in his creative life because he can't direct anymore.
I guess he sort of hates the theater.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. And this was true of you at the time?
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. Yes. With the exception of one play, I didn't direct
anything between 1975 and whenever we began ``Vanya on 42d
Street.'' There was a very, very long and painful hiatus where I
just could not get back to directing. Part of the result of the
movie was a desire to stop doing that kind of Grotowski-influenced
para-theatrical work and to try to return to my life as a director.
And another change was discovering a passionate love of acting,
which is what I had originally wanted to do in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. In a weird way, the movie affected us less than some
people might imagine _ in that we went back to doing sort of what
we were doing before. I think it probably had an effect on our
relationship that was beneficial. There was a kind of bond formed
that hadn't been there before. I'd never done anything that was at
all successful before, and I've never done anything subsequently
that was as successful.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. People have an affection for this movie. I guess it's
similar to the way I feel about ``Casablanca'' or ``The Wizard of
Oz.'' I've met many people who see the movie over and over and over
and over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. The things that I've written just out of my own head have
never been as likable as ``My Dinner With Andre.'' Like certain
kinds of dogs are very likable and people want to pet them, and
others are little more in the snarling or slightly scary category.
It's not something you can control.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. The title has become a catch-phrase.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. There was even a headline about the baseball strike,
something like ``Endless Talks, No Resolution, My Dinner With
Andre.''
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. In East Hampton, why didn't you watch it all the way
through?
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. I couldn't stand that character. I went for a walk and
found Wally out on the curb because he hadn't been able to watch
himself on the screen. One of the things the movie is also about is
narcissism, and I think the Andre character is certainly an amazing
portrayal in depth of a narcissist. I just looked up there and
thought, ``Oh my God, why would anybody in the world want to sit
here and listen to this awful character going on and on?'' Then I
got confused and thought this man was me.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. The film is a sort of mock-documentary, so we'll never
really know to what extent we were like those characters. You know,
I don't mind seeing myself on screen at all. If I'm going to appear
on ``Star Trek,'' I'll move heaven and earth to get to my mother's
house and watch myself on television, because I find it very
amusing. But this was too upsetting. I was enjoying the movie
enormously when he was talking and when I started talking I got out
of there.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. If I were to see myself in ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' it wouldn't bring up any memories except the memories of
playing John the Baptist. But going to see this, there's the
sadness of Chiquita being gone, Louis being gone.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. I suppose that one of the reasons I ran out was watching
that movie has a slight last-act-of-``Our Town'' quality, for us to
be transported into the past the way Emily goes back for her
birthday when she's a child. You can't see the movie without
thinking: that was our life. I felt that whole period leaping back.
Just the way a song brings back certain periods.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. When we were rehearsing ``The Designated Mourner'' the
other day, Wally was talking about memory. He was saying how
difficult it is to really look at the past because we're not
looking at the past as the person we were then, but as the person
we are now. Seeing the movie, Chiquita's alive, and the person I
was then is talking about her. It's just kind of bewildering and
sad. The time I saw it before, the painful moment for me was when I
say something about being in the desert and hallucinating about her
and seeing her grow old.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. Wally, when you were picketing the pickets at Terrence
McNally's play ``Corpus Christi,'' all the newspapers referred to
you as an actor. None of them said ``playwright'' or ``playwright
and actor.''
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. I interpret that through the paranoid and narcissistic
lens of thinking that people on The New York Times have gotten
together and decided that because they hate my plays, they're going
to call me an actor.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. It wasn't just The Times, it was all the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. Really? Well, that's painful, but I have vowed to rise
above narcissism and complaining.
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. Just getting Wally off the hook: Europe is different. A
European director described an evening in Berlin in which six or
seven noted directors, playwrights and film people spent the night
arguing about ``Vanya on 42d Street.'' One attacking it, another
defending it. I can't imagine that happening here.
</P>
<P>
   GUSSOW. But here we are talking about a film 18 years after it
was made _ and people have never stopped talking about it. Would
you see ``My Dinner With Andre'' again?
</P>
<P>
   GREGORY. Oh, I could see it again, but I would never do the
Norma Desmond thing, because I love to hear an audience laughing.
That's really one of my greatest pleasures. It's why I go to every
performance of every play I've ever directed.
</P>
<P>
   SHAWN. I'll try to live long enough so that I could see the
whole movie without getting upset.

DRUG MIX KILLED TUINEI, POLICE SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ANTHONY RAMIREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Tuinei, the former Dallas Cowboys offensive lineman who was
found dead in his car last Thursday, died of a fatal mixture of
heroin and a popular recreational drug known as ecstasy,
authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy by the Collin County medical examiner's office showed
that Tuinei, who was on three Super Bowl teams before he retired
from the Cowboys last year, had used, apparently for the first
time, an undisclosed but small amount of heroin after extended use
for at least two weeks of the drug ecstasy, which is related to
amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you had was a 39-year-old male, 6-foot-5, in excess of
300 pounds, a healthy individual, took one shot of heroin and
basically dropped dead as a result,'' Bruce Glasscock, police chief
of Plano, Tex., said at a news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Glasscock said he believed Tuinei had never used heroin before.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei, a native of Honolulu, came to the Cowboys as an
undrafted defensive lineman out of the University of Hawaii in 1983
and played with Dallas through 1997. A powerful player with a
youthful history of brawling and substance abuse, Tuinei had said
his problems were behind him.
</P>
<P>
   His death was the latest of several drug-related setbacks for
the Cowboys in recent years. Leon Lett, one of the team's best
defensive linemen, faces suspension after failing a drug test for
the third time last month. In 1996, the All-Pro receiver Michael
Irvin pleaded no contest to a felony charge of cocaine possession
and was suspended for five games.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei had difficulty breathing Wednesday night and was driven
back to his home by his friend, Nicky Sualua, 24, a reserve
fullback with the Cowboys. Sualua has told investigators that he
and Tuinei had driven to a North Dallas apartment in search of
heroin.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to a police affidavit that led to a search of Tunei's
home in Plano, near Dallas, after his death, Sualua, who said he
had not taken any drugs, said Tuinei had swallowed at least one
ecstasy tablet. Experts say amphetamines and heroin can cause a
loss of consciousness and sometimes death. A police search of
Tuinei's home led to the seizure of a pipe, a marijuana cigarette
and one ecstasy pill.
</P>
<P>
   After disappearing into the bedroom of the North Dallas
apartment, Tuinei, who said he wanted to inject heroin, emerged
drowsy, out of breath and soon passed out, according to the
affidavit. Sualua administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation , he
told investigators, and got Tuinei breathing more normally. He then
dragged the unconscious former lineman, who weighs more than 300
pounds, to Tuinei's customized 1933 Ford roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Sualua then drove back to Tuinei's home, where Sualua covered
him with two blankets. When Tuinei started snoring, Sualua also
fell asleep. In the morning, Sualua could not revive him.
</P>
<P>
   Sualua could not be reached for comment, and the Plano police
said there were no plans to arrest Sualua.
</P>
<P>
   Tuinei was a respected if taciturn player whose signature phrase
was ``I will crush you like a grape.'' Once he heard his friend
Jesse Sapolu, a center for the 49ers, say before the 1992 NFC title
game that the road to the Super Bowl ran through Candlestick Park.
After the Cowboys won, he told Sapolu, ``Jesse, thanks for the
directions.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Pat Riley, whose affinity for three-hour practices is
legendary, tried something different Tuesday. He gave the Heat the
entire day off.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Majerle needed the time off. He injured his right shoulder
as he tried to get around a screen set by Patrick Ewing during
Monday's victory over the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle told P.J. Brown he thought the shoulder was separated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he was going to come back in the game,'' Brown
said.
</P>
<P>
   After a trip to the locker room, Majerle returned with 7 minutes
48 seconds left _ just in time to sink a pair of huge 3-pointers to
stymie the Knicks' comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two shots were warrior-type shots,'' Brown said. ``They
were two of the biggest shots of the year. Kind of like nails in a
coffin.''
</P>
<P>
   Majerle, who did some shot-inhibiting work on Allan Houston and
Latrell Sprewell, didn't want to consider the idea of not playing
on Wednesday in Game 3 at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty painful,'' he said. ``But if it doesn't get any
worse, I'm sure I'll be able to play. The adrenaline will kick in
the closer we get to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   A larger concern, he noted, is the probability of getting hit on
the shoulder again. Which is likely to happen, given the nature of
the series.
</P>
<P>
   With the series tied at 1-1, Brown, the ex-Net, said he was
hopeful the Knicks would feel the hot glare of an expectant home
crowd on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pressure kind of shifts to them,'' he said. ``I
think their fans expect them to close out the series on their home
floor. We're looking forward to playing them. We're a better road
team than a home team. That's definitely in our favor, but that
doesn't mean we're guaranteed anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has found a way to cope with the tension of this series:
Don't treat it like the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my wife that before the first game, I was maybe too
emotional, too hyped,'' he said. ``I kind of changed up my routine
a little bit and started doing some crazy things I usually don't
do. I feel a lot better now.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, the Heat players know that defense enabled them to
have the Eastern Conference's best regular-season record, just as
it enabled them to stem the bleeding after the Knicks won Game 1.
Still, the Heat is not suddenly one big happy juggernaut. A major
question remains about the viability of Jamal Mashburn as the
team's No. 3 scoring alternative after Tim Hardaway and Alonzo
Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Though he finished with 11 points on Monday, and contributed
mightily to the Heat's fast start, Mashburn did not play in the
fourth quarter. Riley went with the veterans Terry Porter, 36;
Majerle, 33, and Keith Askins, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Riley acknowledged some concern about the 26-year-old Mashburn's
three turnovers, all while dribbling to maneuver a defensive man
out of position. ``He lost his handle on the ball too much, was too
careless,'' said Riley, who is notoriously severe on players who
show any hint of weakness during the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Heat's confidence heading into Wednesday's game has
skyrocketed since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had a huge amount of success in New York, but we
know we're capable of playing well and winning there,'' Mourning
said. ``It's just a matter of us taking the attitude there that
worked for us at home and making some good things happen for us.''

 Valerie Gladstone's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was on
the dancer-choreographer Bebe Miller.

   NEW YORK _ David Parsons sounded distressed. ``Lately, every
time I start a new project, I get unnerved,'' he said over lunch in
Manhattan recently. Although this 39-year-old dancer-choreographer
looks like a hunky, happy-go-lucky movie star, during this
conversation he came across as an angst-ridden artist. ``In the
back of my mind, there's always the word `accessible' that's
constantly thrown at me as an insult. What does it mean? That I
attract the masses? That's bad? My work's not about getting people
to love me. It's about following what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he established his modern-dance company 12 years ago,
some critics have called his work superficial, accusing him of
catering to the lowest common denominator. But why do their
opinions affect him so deeply now? After all, he has had plenty of
time to build defenses. Moreover, his company consistently attracts
new fans, makes money and pleases many more critics than it
disappoints. Obviously something else was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Events of the last two years have made him especially
vulnerable, Parsons said. His confidence became seriously eroded.
``I hit bottom,'' he said. ``I became mean. I gave my dancers a
hard time. I had a terrible breakup with a woman. I didn't have a
permanent place to stay in the city. I tore the cartilage in my
knee and had to have an operation.'' He winced. ``It's coming back
very slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet in spite of his malaise, Parsons acknowledges that he still
has ample reasons to feel positive. The Parsons Dance Company
attracts large audiences, in locations as diverse as Brazil, Italy,
Australia and St. Louis. And its two-week engagement at the Joyce
Theater, starting Tuesday, is nearly sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all the music will be live,'' he said proudly; troupes
appearing at the Joyce usually can't afford musicians. On the first
week's program is his newest work, ``Fill the Woods With Light,''
which had its world premiere at the American Dance Festival in
Durham, N.C., last summer.
</P>
<P>
   It is set to a commissioned score by the jazz saxophonist Phil
Woods, who will play it at the Joyce with his Little Big Band. To a
mix of funky rock-and-roll, blues and bossa nova, Parsons created,
according to Woods, ``a warm dance, sort of down and dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   The second week's program features six works by Robert Battle, a
veteran Parsons dancer. A choreographer new to the New York stage,
Battle offers ``Rush Hour,'' a world premiere, and four New York
premieres, all of them to commissioned scores by John Mackey, 28, a
contemporary composer, who will perform with his ensemble of 10
Juilliard musicians. ``Takademe,'' Battle's sixth New York
premiere, is to the recorded songs of the Indian singer Sheila
Chandra.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' widest exposure yet will come on New Year's Eve. The
Times Square Business Improvement District chose him to stage a
continuous outdoor show on 42d Street from 7 a.m., Dec. 31 until 7
a.m., Jan. 1. ``Basically, it's a TV program going by satellite to
a billion people,'' Parsons said.
</P>
<P>
   As chief of a creative team that includes Michael Curry,
designer of the oversize puppets in the Broadway musical ``The Lion
King,'' Parsons has been asked to create a series of theatrical
events, full of pageantry and with universal appeal. Although the
show is still in the planning stage, he already knows he'll use 150
performers, 10 of them his company members, and that well-known
composers around the world will do the music.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons got the job for several reasons. ``David has a devoted
and very extensive following,'' said Peter Kohlmann, the executive
producer of Times Square 2000. ``We also knew he had standing in
the dance world. Those qualifications, plus his visual sense and
his reputation for being easy to work with, made us pick him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Kohlmann, presenters and booking agents find Parsons' wide
popularity pure gold. ``Last year, David filled our 2,300-seat
opera house five nights running,'' said Maria Rita Stumpf,
president of Antares Promotions in Rio de Janeiro. ``It's the
joyfulness, the exuberant physicality of his work and his
dancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, he did as well in Italy. According to Antonio
Gnecchi, a producer who began representing Parsons 10 years ago,
his troupe sold out in 18 cities. ``David communicates directly,
without pretension,'' Gnecchi said. Sally Bliss, executive director
of Dance St. Louis, was equally enthusiastic. ``Both little kids
and the elderly love his work,'' she said. ``You can't imagine how
many friends his company makes here.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   How does Parsons accomplish this? With a catholic repertory that
includes the show-stopping ``Caught'' (1982), in which a dancer
appears to fly; ``Anthem'' (1998), inspired by the dissolution of
Eastern-bloc dictatorships, and ``Ring Around the Rosie'' (1993),
which refers to AIDS. The first two, along with ``Union'' (1993),
to ``Nefertiti'' by the jazz composer Wayne Shorter, will be
presented this season.
</P>
<P>
   But accomplishments aren't enough, and beneath them are deep
reasons for Parsons' blue mood. ``Sometimes you get so confused,''
he said earnestly. ``You don't know how to separate your personal
life from your professional life. I became bogged down, erratic.
There's always a deadline; every time we do a show, there's a
critic. I feared my creative juices were drying up. I was afraid of
losing the joy in creation.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons fell in love with dance as a 12-year-old in Kansas City,
Mo., and has been immersed in it since, so it's not surprising that
he eventually reached an impasse. Frequently dancer-choreographers
become devastatingly discouraged in their late '30s and early '40s,
when they must look to a future when they can no longer perform.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Taylor, with whose company Parsons starred for nine years,
weathered a similar crisis, as did Twyla Tharp. But it wasn't just
the inevitable physical changes that got to Parsons. The
responsibility for his dancers _ he provides at least 45 weeks of
work and full health and unemployment insurance _ and the constant
touring became too much. He had little energy for choreographing.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of changes have slowly begun to turn the tide; for one,
Parsons travels less with the troupe. ``The pressures built up in
David, and he took it out on us,'' said Jaime Martinez, who
recently became assistant artistic director of the company. ``Today
he gives older members, Liz Koeppen and me, a lot more
responsibility, and it's been great for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, Parsons now plans to produce work by other
choreographers regularly, shifting the weight of creating all the
company's new dances. Battle is the first choreographer to benefit
from Parsons' decision. ``David sees this as the future of dance,''
said Battle. ``No more one-choreographer companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons says when he auditions now, he looks for dancers who
want to choreograph as well. Before being hired, his three new
company members, Kate Skarpetowska, George Smallwood and Sumayah
McRae, submitted videotape of pieces they had created. The idea
wasn't new to Parsons; putting it into practice was. For nine
years, his troupe spent time every summer at the New Arts Summer
Festival in Fort Myers, Fla., teaching choreography and technique.
Now he is trying to establish a school in New York, a permanent
place to nurture dancers and choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My school will be open to everybody,'' he said, dreaming out
loud. ``I'll have a summer session where semiprofessionals from
around the world can come and taste the city and get a feel for
other choreographers and our technique and repertory.''
</P>
<P>
   His mood picked up. ``I want to do more video. I've already used
video to teach disadvantaged kids to dance. I'll do my own
productions and make films for television to get people who don't
go to theater interested in dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons likes collaborations. This season, Missoni and Donna
Karan created many of the company's costumes, and he talked
excitedly about the possibility of working with Mikhail Baryshnikov
on a piece using Vari-Lite, a lighting system run by computers.
Made famous in the shows of the rock group Genesis, Vari-Lite can
rotate 360 degrees, fading from one color and pattern to another.
</P>
<P>
   He then switched to explaining that he might try as backdrops
the underwater photographs of Howard Schatz, or enormous close-ups
of the dancers: ``In film, close-ups are usually what get you
emotionally involved,'' he said. ``I'll have to figure out how we
can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rising to leave, he paused to say: ``You know, I'm actually
feeling better. Something's coming back that is very beautiful.''
And he was smiling.

WEAVING A COUNTERPOINT OF IDEAS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 16) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Tom Ze had just moved into a new apartment,
and he apologized to a visitor for the disarray. The room he uses
for a home recording studio was a jumble of cords, guitars,
microphones and old recording equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Boxes awaited unpacking in the hallways; walls were bare. But
the books were already on the shelves in neat rows: fiction and
history and philosophy from Brazilian and Portuguese authors
alongside Faulkner and Nero Wolfe mysteries by Rex Stout. ``Of
course the books came out first,'' said Ze's wife and sometime
translator, Neusa.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Brazil, where leading songwriters routinely cite
concepts from anthropology and pay homage to avant-garde poets, Ze,
62, comes across as a man who's passionate about ideas. A
conversation wandered from his childhood in Irara, a poor rural
town in Bahia in northeastern Brazil, to his education in
contemporary classical composition at the University of Bahia's
school of music, to his tour with the band Tortoise (which comes to
Irving Plaza in Manhattan on Wednesday) to the Council of Trent, in
the mid-16th century.
</P>
<P>
   While purifying Catholic doctrine, the council banished musical
elements considered lascivious or impure; it set out to define
correct compositional practice for all of Europe. ``It was more
important than the most important composers in Western music,'' Ze
contended.
</P>
<P>
   The Council of Trent wouldn't have approved of Ze's songs, which
are terse little musical contraptions. Drawing at whim from the
great reservoir of Brazilian rhythms and melodies and from his own
instinct for angularity and dissonance, Ze assembles meticulous but
aberrant patterns of rhythm and counterpoint: steely webs of
guitars, percussion and voice.
</P>
<P>
   His lyrics move from tenderness to sarcastic satire to word
games; one song, ``Sem a Letra `A,''' considers what the world
would lose without the letter A, including ``amor.'' The songs are
sly, prickly and ingenious, and they rarely last more than three
minutes because Ze is determined not to bore anyone, especially
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate tedium,'' he said. ``To be a composer is to have
courage. And I don't understand how a composer dares to make a
living through music simply by repeating things that have been done
before.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not a commercial attitude, as Ze could testify. In
Brazil, Ze, whose original name was Antonio Jose Santana Martins,
had his moment of pop glory in the 1960s, when he and a coterie of
fellow musicians from the state of Bahia _ including Caetano
Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and the band Os Mutantes _
transformed Brazilian pop with a movement they called Tropicalia.
</P>
<P>
   Mixing Brazilian traditions and imported rock, the Tropicalists
celebrated the collision of tradition and modernity. Ze's
contribution to ``Tropicalia,'' the movement's 1968 manifesto of an
album, was ``Parque Industrial,'' which put lines from the
Brazilian national anthem alongside advertising jingles and the
English-language refrain ``made in Brazil.'' That same year, he won
a televised song contest with the sardonic ``Sao Sao Paulo, Meu
Amor.''
</P>
<P>
   But his dry voice and smart, playful, unsentimental music
weren't appreciated by a mass public. Nor was his continuing urge
to experiment. By the late 1970s, he was using household appliances
in his arrangements, playing an instrument that triggered assorted
blenders and vacuum cleaners with a keyboard made of doorbells. His
audience dwindled; his recording contract ended in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Ze played for college audiences and scraped by; in the late
1970s, he worked for an advertising agency. ``That was when we
could afford to eat in restaurants sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, David Byrne of the Talking Heads was browsing in a Rio
de Janeiro record store and picked up a copy of Ze's 1976 album,
``Estudando o Samba'' (``Studying the Samba''). Delighted and
startled by the music, Byrne tracked down Ze. Byrne's label, Luaka
Bop, issued a compilation, ``The Best of Tom Ze,'' in 1990,
followed by new albums in 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Luaka Bop has just released ``Postmodern Platos,'' an EP of
remixes of Ze's songs by John McEntire of the Chicago instrumental
band Tortoise, the neo-psychedelic band the High Llamas, Sean
Lennon, the disk jockey Amon Tobin and other Tom Ze fans. The
acclaim from abroad has helped Ze find a new Brazilian audience
too.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Ze begins a United States tour, backed by Tortoise
along with the regular guitarist from his Brazilian band. In some
ways, it's an incongruous match; Ze's songs are quick and
intricate, while Tortoise's music ambles along. But Ze is a
Tortoise fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't make songs that just follow section A with section
B,'' he said. ``They go divagating, as if you were floating lightly
in the clouds. It's like a musical survey, with a mathematics that
turns algebra around.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Tortoise, meanwhile, is learning the convolutions of Ze's songs.
``Most of the tunes are pretty standard in that verse-chorus-verse
sense,'' McEntire said. ``But there are lots of little things,
little rhythmic twists and turns that make you say, `How'd they do
that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ze described his method of composing as ``embarrassingly
simple.'' He has recordings of samba and baiao rhythms in three
different tempos; above them he works out patterns on upper strings
of his guitar, mimicking the cavaquinho, the miniature guitar that
accompanies sambas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a surgeon that opens a belly, that's how I live with
samba,'' he said. ``I have this intimacy, this cohabitation with
samba. I try to find a phrase that repeats, an ostinato, that
decays or degenerates the rhythm of the samba. I try to create a
very consistent counterpoint with the phrases of the cavaquinho,
and when this counterpoint satisfies me, it has a peculiarity _ it
permits me to almost escape tonality. ``The cavaquinhos are like
two walls topped by a ceiling. And this ceiling, to get the
structure to stand upright, must have interesting elements and also
must have a subject to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Ze stood his visitor's Portuguese dictionary on
end, parallel to a box of low-calorie sweetener; those were the
cavaquinhos. Then he balanced a knife across the tops: the melody.
``The melody is a cradle that makes the words have more meaning,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Ze described his music as an extended misunderstanding.
``In truth, I am a composer of only one piece,'' he said. ``I try
to repeat a song I listened to as a child, the song of the
washerwomen in Irara. That was the first music I heard. But every
time I make the attempt to write it, I keep making mistakes, so I
keep trying again. And I keep finding something that moves the
atomic nucleus of my desire to make music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ze delivered that explanation with a touch of irony, but as in
many of his songs, there was sincerity behind the wit. ``They say
that Faulkner's writing speaks about the loss of an Edenic world,''
he said. ``I lost a world just like his, the world of my
grandparents in the country, a world of justice and ethics. I'm
trying to revive this world all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ze doesn't usually listen to other people's music. ``If you look
to the newspaper and to radio and to television, you become
crazy,'' he said. ``Because every day something is happening in
music in the world, and something is taking your attention. And if
you stay in your small room with your small problem, sometimes it
is more important, because you can contribute to the music of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The landscape of creation is a place where you're deeply
alone,'' Ze said. ``A person who's creating has to throw out
everything that he knows and everything that he's seen. So I have
to throw out serialism and tonality, throw out bossa nova and so
on, Tropicalismo, sambas, rock, blues and folkloric music. I have
to reach that lonely place where, if I'm able to reach a syllable,
I'm in the genesis again. That is loneliness, but I can't say that
it would be called pain. On the contrary, I see it with much joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten used to going into that room of emptiness,'' he
continued. ``From time to time the room is full of water, and I'm
like a fish arriving at the shore. I'm an animal that decided not
to develop my wings but to develop my legs. And when the room is
full of fire, that's not a problem because I become a salamander.
And I could think of an apocalypse, like in the Bible, or remember
the folkloric dances of my youth, where I saw these fires in the
distance. But they lit up my heart, too.''

 (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two operas are closely linked: ``Wozzeck,'' a devastating
success; ``Moses und Aron,'' a failure of epic stature. The pupil,
Alban Berg, wrote the first; the teacher, Arnold Schoenberg, the
second. Perhaps no opera since Mozart feels as complete as
``Wozzeck.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses und Aron'' lies unfinished, although its first two acts
were written some 20 years before the composer's death in 1951. The
words for a third act awaited only the music for them.
</P>
<P>
   Both works played at the Metropolitan Opera this season, showing
us two minds going in opposite directions. Schoenberg is the man of
ideas; he looks for operatic characters able to portray them. His
opera begins at the altitudes of thought and descends into the
everyday particulars of life.
</P>
<P>
   Berg starts at the bottom: with humanity, dirt-real if
grotesquely enhanced. Whatever ideas of social injustice or
spiritual suffering his opera gives off arrive as afterthoughts.
Confronted by the soldier Wozzeck and his tormentors, one smells
the sweat of their bodies. The senses come first; speculation is
deferred. ``Wozzeck'' begins with everyday particulars of life and
works its way upward.
</P>
<P>
   Could Schoenberg have acted in any other way? He was, after all,
the self-appointed Moses of 20th-century music, a man of
extraordinary gifts who had an idea about rescuing Western music
from its corruption and enervation. It may be overly cute to say
it, but if Moses came down from the mountaintop with 10
commandments, Schoenberg arrived with 12.
</P>
<P>
   Arranging a systematic usage for the 12 notes of the chromatic
scale would provide an esthetic umbrella under which all the
strands of played-out tonality could gather for safety and new
nourishment. A new freedom, a new world order for music, would
result from overarching speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Do it Schoenberg's way, or at least think in Schoenberg's way,
and you will prosper. Given the time in which he lived, his
Jewishness and his persecution by the Nazis, Schoenberg's view of
himself is an unsettling paradox.
</P>
<P>
   Berg learned the 12-tone method at his teacher's knee but
strayed from its commandments. Schoenberg was tactful but did not
approve. Yet if opera is words, action and, not least, music
together onstage, ``Wozzeck'' synthesizes all three. Swift scenes,
with thought and word pared to the bone, send it forward.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, music speaks to theater and theater to music. The
two are indissoluble. Stunning interludes between scenes form a
kind of subliminal plot. The final instrumental segment is perhaps
Berg's most beautiful creation. Berg gives us not the concepts of
cruelty, arrogance, lust, brutality and madness, but instead, the
Captain, the Doctor, Marie, the Drum Major and Wozzeck. Theater is
not philosophy, although philosophy can be a byproduct.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg's spirit was big enough to accommodate self-doubt,
and this is the subject of ``Moses und Aron.'' For Moses, ideas are
incorruptible, abstract, untouchable. We cannot describe God,
because his essence is unimaginable. (Philosophers might point out
that ``unimaginable'' is a description in itself.)
</P>
<P>
   Aron is the communicator, and the wavering Israelite population
certainly needs reaching. It wants a god in its image but superior:
a doer of magic and miracles. Aron is like a politician's advance
man, putting up posters in the form of graven images, preparing the
way for the Supreme Being's ultimate arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers argue back and forth without clear conclusion,
although in the written but uncomposed third act, Aron is argued
down by his peers, collapses and dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses und Aron'' illustrates with sets and costumes a
conversation going on within the composer's head. The people
onstage, not least the elaborate and powerful chorus, are a public
outlet for private thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg is Moses and, reluctantly, partly Aron as well. It is
assuredly a long way from the essence of God to 12-tone
composition, but there is an ever so faint metaphor at work.
</P>
<P>
   Extenuating circumstances try to explain why Schoenberg never
finished his opera _ the dislocations of emigration to the United
States, the difficulties of earning a living _ but it is just as
easy to believe that the third act never completed represents a
loss of will or, perhaps, conviction. Maybe a truncated ``Moses und
Aron'' is really the complete one: a tortuous inner argument
destined never to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the middle of all this ontological head-scratching is a
wondrous orgy. Nude women are specified (although the Met decided
on underwear); lascivious dancing and carnal excess of every type
are implied. What better way to enjoy evil than to summon it in
great detail and then renounce it.
</P>
<P>
   (Think of Jimmy Swaggart's motel escapades.) Maybe the dance
before the golden calf simply confesses that even the religious
have naughty dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Berg's other opera, ``Lulu,'' is fascinating, but its studied
geometry of plot reduces characters to chess pieces. Two other
operas of our time compete with ``Wozzeck'' as pure theater.
``Pelleas et Melisande,'' from 1902, makes Debussy's orchestra a
wordless narrator and commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Pit speaks to audience, telling us secrets that are withheld
from the lost and clueless souls onstage. In its unusual way,
``Pelleas'' approaches theater we can hear. The singers are like an
obbligato, an almost secondary decoration to the instrumental
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't laugh if my other example is ``Cavalleria
Rusticana'': not quite 20th-century (1890 to be exact) but a
rapid-firing explosion of music drama. The music of ``Cavalleria''
comes as close to hot tempers, lust, violence and the cold sweat of
fear as pure sound can. Mascagni never again came close to that
first success. Such things do happen on the opera stage but not
often.

N.Y. LAWMAKERS TRY TO WEAKEN OR DELAY TOUGH NEW DIPLOMA STANDARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ An unusual bipartisan coalition of state
lawmakers, whose constituents range from inner-city residents to
affluent suburbanites, is pushing to scale back new, more stringent
graduation requirements for nearly all public high school students.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers contend that the new graduation standards are
being phased in too quickly, do not accurately measure the overall
academic performance of students and could result in increased
failure and dropout rates in school districts across the state.
</P>
<P>
   The rising concern in the state Legislature comes as the Board
of Regents, the body charged with setting educational policy for
the state, and the state education commissioner press ahead with
new standardized tests that all high school students will
eventually have to pass to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next year, students will have to pass a more rigorous
English regents exam to earn a high school diploma. In later years,
students will have to pass similar standardized tests in four other
subjects: math; American history and government; global studies,
and science.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what action the Legislature might take to scale
back the new standards, or whether such a move would have the
support of Gov. George Pataki, whose aides declined to comment
Tuesday. But one measure has already been proposed in the Assembly
to allow school districts to use alternative standards to the
regents exam for graduation. The Democratic-controlled Assembly and
the Republican-led state Senate are holding joint hearings on the
issue around the state.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the leaders of both chambers say they have heard
widespread concerns that the new graduation requirements may deny
diplomas to thousands of students.
</P>
<P>
   That the Senate and the Assembly have found common ground on
this issue is remarkable, given that their leaders agree on almost
nothing else. To date, both houses have jointly passed only about
two dozen pieces of legislation this session, none of them major,
and budget talks are still deadlocked almost six weeks past the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's growing concern that relying on one set of
standardized, time-pressured tests will leave hundreds of thousands
of students behind,'' said Assemblyman Richard Brodsky,
D-Westchester County, who proposed legislation to allow alternative
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue has resonance that goes well beyond the traditional
fault lines that have polarized education debates in the past,''
Brodsky added. ``It affects every community in the state, whether
they are in the inner cities or in the suburbs.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Deputy Majority Leader Dean Skelos, R-Nassau
County, agreed. ``There is really universal and bipartisan concern
with what they are doing,'' he said of the new regents standards.
``We are hopeful that the Board of Regents will get the message
that the Legislature is not happy with what they have done.''
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview late Tuesday afternoon, state Education
Commissioner Richard Mills, one of the architects of the new
graduation standards, said any move to relax the standards would
rob students of the education they need to compete in the
workplace. ``The reason we raised the standards was in response to
a public outcry that the old standards were too low,'' he said,
adding, ``We just have to stay the course and insist that children
get the education that they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said the new standards had already raised academic
performance. He said 78 percent of high school seniors passed the
regents English exam last year, even though it was not required for
graduation. ``The standards are working,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner is chosen by the regents, who in turn are
appointed by the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The state first offered the regents exam in 1879 as a standard
for colleges to use in evaluating high school graduates. But until
now, students only needed to pass a competency test to graduate,
and only a minority _ fewer than 25 percent of graduates in New
York City _ have taken diplomas showing they passed the more
difficult Regents exams.

WHERE'S BUSH? TEXAS LEGISLATORS SAY GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP `ABSENT' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
and JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's promise to stay in Texas
until the Legislature ends later this month has led some political
activists in Iowa and New Hampshire to grumble that Bush is too
busy being governor to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   And now many Texas lawmakers are grumbling aloud that Bush has
been too busy running for president to take care of his legislative
business at home.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they say, the governor's major proposals for $2.6
billion in tax cuts and teacher pay raises are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 Democratic legislators held a news conference Tuesday
to complain, among other things, about Bush's leadership being
``absent'' this session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Waldo?'' one legislator blurted out, referring to a
series of children's books in which the reader must search for
Waldo in a sea of faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'd say he's been missing in action, but it's
been pretty close to that,'' said Rep. Kevin Bailey, D-Houston.
``He's a lot less involved than in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A Houston Chronicle review of Bush's office calendars shows the
governor has had about half the personal involvement in this
legislative session that he had during the 1997 Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The major issues on which he campaigned _ tax cuts, a
requirement for girls to notify their parents before they can get
an abortion and vouchers that would allow parents to use public
money to send their children to private school, all are in trouble.
If the bills fail, it will give Bush's presidential campaign
opponents ammunition to attack him as an ineffective leader.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was adamant Tuesday that in the end he will get most of
what he asked for from the Legislature, including a ``significant''
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Bush noted that measures to lower the maximum alcohol level for
drunken driving and to restrict Y2K lawsuits were on their way to
his desk or about to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a part of the Bush agenda that seems to be moving along
quite nicely,'' Bush said. ``Most of the issues I campaigned on
came out of the Senate, and there will be a moment of
reconciliation (with the House.)''
</P>
<P>
   But an education finance bill that recently came out of the
Senate only delivered half of Bush's promised $2 billion property
tax cut, with the rest set for teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is now hung up in the House Education Committee because
Democrats do not believe there is enough money to pay for tax cuts
and teacher pay increases.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, said he is delaying
the bill until he gets a new state revenue estimate from
Comptroller Carole Rylander, not to any lack of effort by Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been fine with me,'' Sadler said. ``He's been very
responsive. I've never been put off. I've never been told he's
meeting with somebody else he can't meet with me.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush's program has been struggling in the Texas session,
his brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, ended his first legislative session in
Florida two weeks ago by getting virtually everything he asked for,
including $1 billion in tax cuts and a private school voucher
program. The Texas voucher bill pushed by this state's Bush is all
but dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Republicans need a Bush primary to make sure they're
running the right sibling (for president),'' Wall Street Journal
columnist Paul Gigot wrote last week.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas political scientist Bruce Buchanan said
Republican primary voters around the country are more likely to
judge Bush by his legislative successes than on a failure to
deliver on all that he promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Bush) always chooses his issues in such a way that he can
declare victory no matter what happens,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is clear that Bush's presidential ambitions have
distracted from his attention to legislative detail.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the governor's own apointments calendars, Bush has
been less involved overall with this Legislature than the one held
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has held about 30 hours of scheduled meetings with
legislators, his ``private'' schedule, which has set aside the time
he uses for presidential politics, has consumed about 64 hours of
Bush's time.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has attended 63 scheduled meetings with legislators in the
1999 session, compared to 134 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The schedules surveyed by the Chronicle began Dec. 1, before the
Legislature opened, through April 26 for both the 1997 and 1999
legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said the governor has numerous
unscheduled meetings with lawmakers, particularly late in the day.
She said she believes he has kept the same pace of unscheduled
meetings that he had in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's one-on-one interviews with the Texas news media
has remained almost steady, but Bush's 32 national news media
interviews _ including five with The New York Times _ is almost
triple the number he granted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Calls on Bush by foreign dignitaries and ambassadors are up from
eight in 1997 to 29 this year. That includes a telephone call Bush
received last month from President Eduard Shevardnadze of the
former Soviet republic of Georgia. Shevardnadze was the Soviet
foreign minister when Bush's father was in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Shevardnadze called while in Houston to meet with former
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Houston oil companies
interested in Caspian Sea exploration. Shevardnadze also met with
President Clinton in Washington during that trip.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said Tuesday he is using persuasion to lead the
Legislature. That includes his personal involvement, staff
involvment and announcing his stands on issues important to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meet with people all the time. My staff members meet with
people all the time. People know exactly what my position is,''
Bush told reporters. ``When I say things and you put it in the
press, it actually reflects my view that I believe we can have a
substantial tax cut and teacher pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he meets regularly with Lt. Gov. Rick Perry and House
Speaker Pete Laney.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's staff also joined a series of intense negotiations Sunday
in an effort to pry a compromise bill out of the Legislature to
require parental notification before a minor can receive an
abortion. Bush has promised such a bill since he first ran for
governor in 1994, and anti-abortion activists are holding his feet
to the fire in this session to come through.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there is still plenty of time to get what he wants
from this Legislature. And he said he has no concern about whether
the results of this session affect his presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important for the work product of this session is that
it is important for Texas,'' Bush said. ``We'll worry about the
exploratory business later on. Right now, it's what's best for
Texas.''

$5 MILLION JURY AWARD IN STRIP-SEARCH CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal jury has ordered New York City to pay $5
million to a woman who was strip-searched by jail guards, a verdict
that could have broad financial ramifications for the city as it
faces a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of 63,000 people who
say they were illegally strip-searched.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first decision against the city for its policy of
strip-searching all people arrested and arraigned on minor charges
in Manhattan and Queens over a period of about 10 months in 1996
and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The city Department of Correction said at the time that it
adopted the policy ``for security purposes,'' even though a federal
appeals court had ruled in 1986 that the Fourth Amendment precluded
strip-searches of people charged with misdemeanors or other minor
offenses unless there was a reasonable suspicion that weapons or
contraband was being concealed.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which the city will appeal, was returned on
Thursday in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. It granted a smaller
compensatory award of $19,600 to cover the woman's pain and
suffering as well as her medical expenses, in addition to its award
of $5 million in punitive damages, city officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, along with a recent settlement in which the city
agreed to pay $25,000 each to four Fordham University students who
were strip-searched by the police, suggests that the city may be
facing a staggering bill as it attempts to resolve yet another
case: about 63,000 people who say they were strip-searched while
the policy was in force.
</P>
<P>
   While the city has not conceded any liability, it acknowledged
in court papers that the searches were conducted by jail guards who
had not been told of legal requirements of reasonable suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   A senior city official said Tuesday night that the Giuliani
administration was negotiating with lawyers for the class-action
suit in hopes of resolving the matter before trial.
</P>
<P>
   The class action, said Michael Hess, the corporation counsel for
the city, ``is a very serious case, and we're attempting to address
the issues in a way that is fair to the class as well as to the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The money can't come from the sky,'' he added. ``It would come
from the taxpayers. There are multiple concerns that our office has
to address.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials said Tuesday night that although they were
concerned about what might lie ahead in the case, they believed
that most of the people subjected to the searches had been
previously charged with crimes like drug offenses or prostitution.
They said that, therefore, many of the searches might have been
reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Emery and Matthew Brinckerhoff, the lawyers handling the
class-action lawsuit, said that even if the punitive damages award
is overturned, the compensatory verdict would be a useful gauge of
what a jury might award in their case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the city is going to be constructive in their
approach to settling this case,'' Emery said, citing what he called
``the extreme nature of the jury's reaction, which demonstrates the
city's exposure for its cavalier attitude'' in adopting the
strip-search policy.
</P>
<P>
   The city had argued that the policy was necessary because
crowded conditions in the cells where people are held while
awaiting arraignment heightened security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed last year, the chief of the Department of
Correction, Edward Reilly, said, ``I believe these searches were
necessary to detect and remove dangerous contraband from the
pre-arraignment inmates and area, and to insure, as far as
practicable, a reasonable level of safety'' to inmates and others.
</P>
<P>
   At last week's trial of the suit brought on behalf of Debra
Ciraolo, Judge Robert Patterson said the 1986 appeals court ruling
left the city without a defense and told the the jury to ignore the
question of whether the city was liable and to decide only the size
of the damage award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the judge recognized that there was a clear
constitutional standard that applied to strip-searches of people
charged with misdemeanors,'' said Stephen Weiner, who represented
Ms. Ciraolo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ciraolo, a Greenwich Village resident who works as an
interpreter for the deaf in the city's schools, courts and
hospitals, had maintained in her suit that she was falsely arrested
in January 1997 after a domestic dispute and taken to a holding
cell near the Criminal Court at 100 Centre Street.
</P>
<P>
   Two female guards ordered her to disrobe completely, Ms. Ciraolo
testified, and then ``they told me to walk towards the wall and to
turn around.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the guards, who were wearing rubber gloves, then
told her to bend over.
</P>
<P>
   She squatted instead, she said. ``They told me to cough. And I
was still bending, squatting over, and I said, `What?' And they
said, `Cough.' And so I coughed.''
</P>
<P>
   She was then allowed to get dressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so shamed,'' said Ms. Ciraolo, 43. ``I felt as if I was
taken to the lowest human emotion that anyone could possibly
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury found that the city had ``acted in wanton disregard of
or wanton indifference'' to Ms. Ciraolo's rights, the transcript
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly, in an affidavit filed in the class action suit, said the
strip-search policy did not include searches of body cavities but
rather visual inspections in which there was no contact between
prisoners and guards.
</P>
<P>
   The policy included a ``visual inspection of the inmate's
armpits, mouth, ears, nose, and navel while the inmate is
undressed,'' Reilly said, but not ``visual inspection of an
inmate's anal or vaginal cavity.'' He also said the policy did not
require inmates to lift their breasts or genitals or to bend over.
However, Reilly said, inmates may have been ordered ``to perform a
deep knee bend in order to expel any contraband that may be
secreted in the anal or vaginal cavity.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the city called such searches ``strip-frisks.''
</P>
<P>
   But Brinckerhoff, one of the lawyers in the class-action case,
disputed Reilly's account, saying that the jail guards routinely
ordered inmates to bend over, and to lift their breasts or genitals
for visual inspection.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When the class action lawsuit was originally filed in May 1997,
it attacked the policy of strip-searching all suspects in
Manhattan, a total estimated at 25,000 people. But the number of
plaintiffs kept rising as new information about strip-searches in
Manhattan and in Queens was revealed by the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit involving the Fordham students, the city agreed
to pay $25,000 to each of them, to settle claims that they were
strip-searched illegally by police after they were arrested last
year for doubling up as they passed through a subway turnstile,
said their lawyer, Martha Rayner.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four women was taken to a bathroom at the 46th
Precinct station house in the Bronx and told to disrobe completely,
the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Each was then told to squat and cough, and a female officer
examined one under her breasts, the suit said. No contraband was
found, and the the women had had no prior contact with police, the
suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rayner said that from a practical point of view, the
settlements with her clients and last week's jury verdict suggested
that the city has a real incentive to curtail illegal searches and
retrain police and correction officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never mind the morality or the civil rights aspects of it,''
she said. ``They're liable for an awful lot of money, and it seems
to me that they would want to right this wrong.''

EUROPEAN OFFICIALS COMMIT TO DEVELOPING COMMON DEFENSE POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Alarmed by their dependence on the United States in
NATO's military campaign against Serbia, European officials vowed
Tuesday to develop a strong common defense policy.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Bremen in northern Germany, defense and foreign
ministers of the Western European Union, Europe's long-dormant
military arm, issued a statement saying they were now committed to
``the development of an effective European defense and security
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   George Robertson, the British defense minister, summed up the
mood by declaring, ``In Kosovo, we have all come face to face with
the European future, and it is frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union has long been an economic giant and a
military midget, content to leave most of its security concerns to
NATO. But a combination of the crisis in Kosovo, a new British
readiness to contribute to a European military arm within NATO, and
a growing German determination to play an active security role in
Europe appear to have led to a decisive shift of mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this meeting, we have taken a considerable step toward a
common European security and defense policy,'' Rudolf Scharping,
the German defense minister, said. ``Today, we have too many
institutions and too little substance.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference to institutional excess was clearly an allusion to
the Western European Union itself, an organization of 10 European
nations that belong to NATO. Several European governments,
including Germany's, have concluded that the Western European Union
must now be merged with the European Union as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   This measure, combined with the appointment of a European High
Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, would
begin to give the 15-nation European Union the means to coordinate
military policies that now duplicate one another in many areas,
increasing cost and diminishing effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Several ministers said Tuesday that they hoped to push through
those reforms by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Europe, with no equivalent to the C-5 and C-17 aircraft, is
almost completely dependent on the United States for air transport
of troops, an increasingly important asset when mobility rather
than static ground defenses are at a premium in the aftermath of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The continent also depends heavily on Washington for strategic
reconnaissance and has lagged in the development of new military
technologies like laser-guided bombs. Eager to cash in the ``peace
dividend'' in the last decade, European governments have cut
military spending to an average of about 2.1 percent of gross
national product, compared with about 3.2 percent in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kosovo campaign, the United States, with 639 aircraft,
already has more than double the number of planes of all its NATO
allies combined. It is planning to send 176 more planes. In effect,
the Europeans have played an active supporting role, but have been
obliged to confront the extent of their dependency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Europeans should not expect the United States to play a
role in every disorder in our back yard,'' British Prime Minister
Tony Blair said recently, arguing that European governments had
generally failed to modernize their armies for the post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
   Blair played a central role in the framing of a joint
British-French military initiative late last year. It was
significant because it seemed to represent the end of a long
division between a France committed to a stronger European defense
arm, even at NATO's expense, and a Britain overwhelmingly committed
to the Atlantic Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The accord reflected France's grudging acquiescence to the idea
that Europe's defense should be developed within NATO, and
Britain's realization that it had to work more closely with its
European defense partners. Duplication in spending has long made
Europe's military outlays much less cost-effective than those in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The defense ministers said Tuesday that a European military arm
must emerge ``in complementarity with the Atlantic Alliance.''
Scharping said recently, ``The last aim is to sever the European
decision-making process from NATO,'' adding that the intention was
``to strengthen the European pillar within the alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   On this basis, the Clinton administration has supported Europe's
efforts to put together a more coherent military organization and
force that would be able to undertake some NATO missions using
American military assets but not American troops. But exactly how
``a common defense policy'' for Europe would work in practice
remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear is that efforts to increase military spending
will meet resistance from many Europeans, even in the aftermath of
the Kosovo conflict. European budgets are also constrained by a
financial pact to bolster the euro currency that limits deficits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A European army is still very much in the planning stage,''
Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, said Tuesday.

 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Goldman Sachs Group went public last week, its
former chairman, Jon S. Corzine, became a very rich man. He also
effectively became unemployed. Having lost a power struggle earlier
this year, Corzine ended his formal relationship with the Wall
Street firm once the public offering was completed.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't take him long to rebound. By week's end, Corzine
was in Atlantic City for a conference of New Jersey's Democratic
Party, using his gentle Midwestern charms to audition for a job
even his closest associates never realized he wanted: U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been interested in public service,'' Corzine (the
last syllable of his name rhymes with ``pine'') said in his hoarse,
whispery voice between handshakes at the conference, where few
people knew what he looked like but almost everyone had heard
estimates of his net worth. (More than $300 million).
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many New Jersey Democrats, Corzine, has
emerged as a leading contender in a crowded Democratic field to
replace Sen. Frank Lautenberg, the three-term Democrat who plans to
retire next year. Virtually unknown in state political circles,
Corzine, a 52-year-old native of Illinois who now lives in Summit,
N.J., has leaped ahead of more seasoned politicians largely on the
strength of his fortune, which he has vowed to use lavishly on a
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But he has also been quietly promoted by a coterie of
influential Democrats, many of them close to Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli, New Jersey's other Democratic senator, who do not want
the nomination to go to the best organized of the Democratic
candidates, former Gov. Jim Florio. Those Democrats say Florio,
while capable of winning a primary, will certainly lose in a
general election, particularly if his opponent is Christie Whitman,
the Republican who ousted him as governor in '93.
</P>
<P>
   Though Torricelli says it is premature for him to back anyone,
he came close to endorsing Corzine in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Democratic Party in New Jersey and the Democratic
caucus in the Senate to have a candidate from the most prestigious
banking house in the world has some merit,'' he said. ``This is a
guy who can speak on economic and tax issues with some authority.
And that is going to be appealing to many Democrats in New
Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's supporters are now trying to winnow the field of other
candidates and unify leaders from the state's populous northern
counties behind the investment banker. They are hoping to set up a
one-on-one primary against Florio, who has the support of seven
southern county chairmen. A crowded Democratic field, Corzine's
advisers say, would benefit Florio.
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates, including Rep. Frank Pallone; Michael
Murphy, a former Prosecutor, and Thomas Byrne, a former state party
chairman, say they have no plans to drop out. But many party
leaders think the pressure on them to step aside will be intense if
Corzine formally jumps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue of his money is going to be pretty daunting to the
other candidates,'' said Thomas P. Giblin, the state Democratic
chairman, who has met with Corzine several times but remains
neutral in the race.
</P>
<P>
   But while Corzine's immense wealth may win him fans among some
political leaders, some Democrats worry that it could also offend
Democratic primary voters who might view it as evidence that he is
out of touch with them.
</P>
<P>
   Though he does not plan to make an official announcement for
several days, Corzine has told friends he plans to run, and in an
interview last Friday, he said he was leaning strongly in that
direction. Two things could hold him back, friends say: opposition
from his family and a desire to start a business. Asked about his
wife's feelings, Corzine replied, ``She's not opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, he has taken firm steps toward starting a
campaign. He has hired Doug Schoen, who does polling for President
Clinton, to measure public support for Florio and Whitman. He has
talked to Robert Shrum, the veteran Democratic media consultant,
about working on the campaign. And he has recruited a former state
director for Lautenberg, Christy Davis, to help him meet New Jersey
Democratic officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his immense wealth and growing support, Corzine is
not a shoo-in, even among the anti-Florio forces. Though he has
given nearly $1 million to the Democratic Party over the past
decade, almost none of that money went to New Jersey candidates,
leaving him with no base of support in the state.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike Lautenberg, another rich
businessman-turned-politician, Corzine has not been active in local
politics, has not run for office and even failed to vote on
numerous occasions. Many of his critics think Corzine is running
solely because Torricelli nudged him into it.
</P>
<P>
   More important to many Democrats, Corzine must answer some
fundamental questions about what he stands for and whether an
untested candidate like him can endure the strain of a long
campaign. Last weekend, many Democrats were openly wondering
whether the party of urban poor and organized labor should endorse
a wealthy banker who lives in the suburbs and who ran a Wall Street
firm known for helping big companies gobble up smaller ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a concern about sending the wrong message,'' said Paul
M. Bangiola, chairman of the Morris County Democratic Committee,
who is leaning toward supporting Murphy. ``He's charming. But the
rich guy rap is a tough one to overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the surest sign that Corzine is viewed in some
quarters as the man to beat, labor supporters of other Democratic
candidates have begun circulating a memo asserting that under
Corzine, Goldman Sachs helped finance mergers and acquisitions that
led to the layoffs of 74,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we really need another multimillionaire businessman in
politics?'' asked Jimmy Tarlau, president of the Mercer County
Labor Union Council, who favors Pallone. ``If it's between him and
Florio, I think I'd have to support Florio. At least I know what
Florio stands for.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's supporters have worked hard to paint a different
picture of the candidate. They describe him as a modest farm boy
who has been New Deal Democrat all his life. Though he owns a
summer home on Long Island's East End, he has also contributed $2
million to help poor minority students attend parochial schools in
New York City, and millions more to support public libraries and
the performing arts. As co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, they say, he
helped create more jobs than were lost through mergers and
takeovers.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Corzine grew up on a 120-acre farm in Willys Station, Ill. (pop.
17), where his father grew corn and soybeans. His mother taught
first- and second-grade in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   In his senior year at the University of Illinois, he married a
childhood friend, Joanne Dougherty. The couple, who settled in
Summit in the 1970s, have three children.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a business degree from the University of Chicago, he
joined Goldman Sachs in 1975. He rose through the ranks, earning a
reputation as an accessible manager and consensus builder, and
became chief executive in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine has clearly succeeded on one front: convincing
Democratic leaders that, for all his money, he is a regular guy.
Tall, lean and balding, with a thick graying beard and mitt-like
hands, Corzine speaks in a soft, slow, serene voice that seems
reassuringly down home.
</P>
<P>
   But Corzine acknowledged that he has much to do to sell himself
to New Jersey's skeptical politicians and wary electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an underdog,'' he said. ``I don't enter this under any
preconception that this is anything other than a very difficult
thing to accomplish.''

4 HEROIN DEATHS IN 4 PLACES REFLECT DRUG'S SPREAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A dentist from New Jersey is found dead in his maroon
Oldsmobile on an East Village street. A young drifter dies on the
same street in a tenement that he shared with squatters. A pressman
dies at the Tribeca printing company where he worked. And a
35-year-old man is found dead in his room at a YMCA. in Greenpoint,
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The four men were from different walks of life, but the police
said that they apparently all died Monday or Tuesday in the same
way: from heroin overdoses. Their deaths have sparked unease among
drug users as well as police investigation that will seek to
determine if the four men bought tainted or unusually strong heroin
from a common source.
</P>
<P>
   Their deaths underscored the sense that as heroin use has spread
in New York, many addicts no longer fit the stereotype of junkies
as byproducts of inner-city poverty.
</P>
<P>
   That was painfully evident Tuesday in Summit, N.J., where
friends, neighbors and patients were trying to grapple with the
news that Dr. Peter Brown, 39, whom they knew as a dentist, a
long-distance runner and an avid gardener, had apparently died of a
heroin overdose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a picture of a heroin addict, it just wouldn't be
him,'' said James Ralston, the president of a software company with
its office in the same building as Brown's dental practice, on a
genteel stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
   If the news that a suburban dentist had died of an overdose
stunned his neighbors in New Jersey, it was little surprise to the
people who run the Lower East Side Needle Exchange Program, a
storefront operation on Avenue C near East Fourth Street in
Manhattan where addicts trade their old needles for new ones as a
protective measure against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see men in business attire, women with Prada bags, some who
look like grandmothers,'' said Drew Kramer, the executive director
of the Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center, which runs the needle
exchange along with a number of other services for heroin users and
people with AIDS. He said heroin users have become younger and more
diverse, with nearly a third of recent enrollees under 23.
</P>
<P>
   The four deaths, while an unusually large number for so short a
period, nevertheless reflect the deadly toll that heroin and
morphine continue to take in the city. In 1996, the most recent
year for which figures are available, 560 lives were claimed by the
two drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was found dead in his car at 6:30 a.m. on Monday on Ninth
Street between Avenues C and D. Some empty glassine envelopes were
beside his body, police said. An autopsy conducted Tuesday was
inconclusive, and pathologists are awaiting the results of
toxicology tests before they announce the cause of his death, said
Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the office of the chief medical
examiner.
</P>
<P>
   On the same block, Matthew Boyd, 26, was found dead at 733 E.
Ninth St., a tenement filled with squatters. Across town Richard
Spadafora, 42, a pressman, died Monday at De Jay Litho, a printing
company at 200 Hudson St. in Tribeca. The man who was found dead in
Brooklyn, with a syringe in a nearby sink, had yet to be identified
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   After learning about the deaths of Brown and of Boyd, workers at
the exchange began trying to get the word out about possible
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warning: Dangerous Dope!'' read a leaflet handed out by staff
members. Inside their office, a green chalkboard bore the heading:
``Know Dangerous Drugs? Tell the staff.'' Tuesday, the chalkboard
warned of ``Chocolate colored dope,'' because many users said that
the heroin that caused the overdoses was dark.
</P>
<P>
   But such warnings carry their own risks ``Telling people to be
really careful because someone is selling pure heroin is like
telling people to be really careful because someone is giving away
fast cars that go 200 miles an hour,'' Drew said.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Finkel, a counselor at the center, said: ``Everybody's
looking for it. They want to know where it is, who has it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was borne out in Tompkins Square Park, where a 28-year-old
heroin user with an inverted Mohawk haircut who gave his name only
as Junior said: ``If the dope's killing people, I want some. That
means it's really good dope. It's just natural to want to get the
best quality of anything in life. Don't you want to go to the best
restaurant?''
</P>
<P>
   As Junior spoke he tried to prop up his friend Frank, who was
nodding out.
</P>
<P>
   The precise causes of death and any possible link between them
were still unclear Tuesday. A police official said that preliminary
laboratory tests conducted on some of the heroin that was recovered
indicated that it was not tainted. He said that the heroin was
stronger than usual _ 70 percent pure _ but that heroin even 85- or
90-percent pure was no longer rare.
</P>
<P>
   Pathologists were awaiting the results of toxicology tests
before determining a cause of death in the three Manhattan cases,
Ms. Borakove said, and an autopsy is scheduled to be performed
Wednesday on the man's body found in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the building where Boyd was found, a resident who gave
his name only as Michael remembered him as an artist who had
planned to go to Maine this week. ``He was found over his
doper-kit,'' said Michael, who accompanied him to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   In Summit, friends said Brown had struggled with alcohol but
that they had never suspected drug use. ``I can't get over this,''
a friend said. ``I didn't sleep a wink last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside a church in Summit where Brown had attended Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings, people shook their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter tried his hardest,'' said Steve, a patient and friend
who in keeping with the group's tradition gave only his first name.
``It hurt me that he couldn't stay sober, and it's sad that he
couldn't pass away sober. But his death will make me more diligent
about staying sober.''

CASE POINTS UP THE `FREEDOM' OF USING ENCRYPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Do you have freedom of speech if you're writing
computer code?
</P>
<P>
   Last week the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Bernstein
vs. Dept. of Justice that you do. The ruling was a milestone in the
commercial use of encryption.
</P>
<P>
   The case concerned a two-page program called Snuffle. Its
author, Daniel Bernstein, was a graduate student when he wrote it,
and is now a professor of mathematics at the University of Chicago.
Snuffle was a neat way to put messages into secret code. To
cryptographers, it was ``a zero delay private-key stream encryptor
based upon a one-way hash function.'' To the State Department it
was munitions, exactly as if Bernstein had devised a new kind of
grenade launcher.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government couldn't stop Bernstein from showing his
program to an American, but if he showed it to a foreigner, he had
to get a license.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because encryption is the bane of police. FBI Director
Louis Freeh told Congress last year that strong encryption is
allowing ``drug lords, terrorists and even violent gangs to
communicate about their criminal intentions with impunity and
maintain electronically stored evidence of their crimes impervious
to lawful search and seizure.''
</P>
<P>
   Encryption was once the tool of spies; now it is as common as
keyboards. Like curtains on windows, it shields both the innocent
and the wicked.
</P>
<P>
   That's the police's worry, and it's real. The question was
whether government could stop Bernstein from publishing Snuffle on
the Internet, where foreigners could download it. Did its demand
that Bernstein get a license, which officials could refuse, violate
his constitutional rights?
</P>
<P>
   Two judges said it did. One said it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting judge, Thomas Nelson, argued that the language
Snuffle was written in, C, is one that ``only a few people can
actually understand.'' To him, the program was a tool to manipulate
a machine, and was ``more like conduct than speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court, Judge Betty Fletcher noted that Snuffle
was in source code unreadable by a machine unless compiled into
ones and zeroes. Source code, she wrote, is ``meant to be read and
understood by humans.'' Programmers use source code ``in much the
same way that mathematicians use equations or economists use
graphs'' _ to communicate ideas. That's speech, she wrote, and
therefore cannot be subject to ``the boundless discretion'' of
federal officials.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ended there, but she made two observations. First,
she wrote, the export controls are an attempt to ``interdict the
flow of scientific ideas,'' which ``would appear to strike deep
into the heartland of the First Amendment.'' Second, she wrote,
encryption is a way for people to protect their privacy while using
cell phones, e-mail and the Internet. Taking that away may violate
people's Fourth Amendment right to be secure in their persons and
papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has not given up. It has asked the full
9th Circuit to rehear the case, and if it loses there, will likely
appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   All this is more than academic interest. Ira Rubinstein, senior
corporate attorney at Microsoft Corp., says that company uses
strong encryption for ``virtually every product we ship that does
any kind of network communications.'' Even its Internet Explorer
browser, which it provides for free, comes in two versions: a U.S.
version, with strong encryption, and a foreign version, with
encryption easier to crack.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, this common browser, on millions of computers in the
United States, was classified under the U.S. International Traffic
in Arms Regulations as munitions. Jurisdiction has been moved to
the Commerce Department, so that absurdity has been removed. But it
is still illegal to give the U.S. version of Explorer to, say, a
Frenchman.
</P>
<P>
   The foreigner, however, can turn to a number of companies that
offer upgrades to U.S. products. One example is Baltimore
Technologies (www.baltimore.ie), which, despite its name, is based
in Ireland. There are lots of other ways to get software; it is a
product, Rubinstein says, ``that does not lend itself to this kind
of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's hope is a bill in Congress called the SAFE Act,
which would remove export controls on consumer software. The bill,
which has been pushed for several years now, is supported by the
Washington state delegation except Rep. Norm Dicks, who has sided
with the FBI. Rubinstein says the SAFE Act is on a fast track in
Congress and should be out of committees by the July 4 recess.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that will do it. If not, there is always the Bernstein
case, slowly winding its way toward the high court.

WHITMAN VOWS TO BYPASS BAR ASSOCIATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JERRY GRAY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman, still angry over the
state Bar Association's rejection of her nomination of Attorney
General Peter Verniero to the state Supreme Court, said Tuesday
that she would not send any future Supreme Court nominees to the
bar for review.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's not my intention to go to the bar for
Supreme Court nominations,'' said Whitman, who has criticized the
association harshly for leaks of what was supposed to be a
confidential process of reviewing Verniero's qualifications. ``For
other court nominations, we need to review and make sure we will
continue confidentiality that can be guaranteed by the bar. We're
reviewing it all.''
</P>
<P>
   In just over five years in office, Whitman has already made her
mark on New Jersey's Supreme Court. She has made three appointments
to the seven-member court, and two other justices will reach the
mandatory retirement age of 70 before her term expires in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining her decision during a bill-signing ceremony in
Princeton Tuesday, Whitman said a governor does not need the bar
association's assessment for a Supreme Court nominee in the same
way that he or she would need help judging lower court candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know those candidates,'' she said of the Supreme Court
nominees. ``It's not the same as many of the lower court justices
that we don't have the time or the ability to review in the kind of
depth that we should, and that's why we have relied on the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The bar association rejected the Verniero nomination in a 17-6
vote. But in the 40-member Republican-controlled Senate on Monday,
Verniero received 21 votes, the minimum needed for approval, after
a bitter partisan fight.
</P>
<P>
   And Whitman's comments Tuesday angered Democrats all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Richard Codey called it ``an act of
spite'' that should be put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision that significant shouldn't be made in a climate of
such high emotions,'' Codey said in a statement. ``It would have
been wiser had the governor simply accepted her ultimate victory
instead of reacting to the bar's rejection of her nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph A. Bottitta, the president of the New Jersey State Bar
Association, said he would ``reach out'' to Whitman to discuss her
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 30-year-old compact, governors of New Jersey have
traditionally sent judicial nominations to the bar association for
confidential reviews. The purpose of the compact _ modeled after a
longstanding agreement between the president of the United States
and the American Bar Association _ was to try to remove politics
from judicial choices.
</P>
<P>
   The bar's decision is not binding, but it has traditionally
carried significant weight. Whitman is the first governor to ignore
the bar association's recommendation when it came to a nominee for
the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process was not what we would have hoped for, certainly
not from the confidentiality aspect of the bar's review,'' Whitman
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not live up to the compact.''

   INDIA: ANNIVERSARY OF NUCLEAR TESTS
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of a mural depicting a mushroom cloud, Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee _ a lame duck since his coalition
lost a confidence vote last month _ cited the tests as one of the
main achievements of his year in office. Vajpayee, the leader of
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, also said the threat to
peace from NATO ``aggression'' in Yugoslavia further justified
India's decision to develop nuclear weapons and added, ``If need be
we will take further steps to bolster India's defenses.''

 &HT;    Reds aren't the worst after game against Brewers
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ For only the fourth time this season, the enigmatic
Cincinnati Reds own a two-game winning streak. And for the first
time in 10 days they are not the National League Central division
bottom-feeders.
</P>
<P>
   With a 9-1 victory over Milwaukee in front of 31,435 Kid Glove
Night fans Tuesday in Cinergy Field, the Reds vaulted over the
Brewers into fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   Can they make it three straight? They haven't won three in a row
all season and get that chance tonight against the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Two-run home runs by Barry Larkin, Dmitri Young and Michae
Tucker were the loudest of nine hits as the Reds won for the fifth
time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Mike Cameron contributed three hits, two stolen
bases and a run scored to provide starter Steve Avery with his
second victory against three losses, although he needed help from
the bullpen when he had to leave after five innings with a blister
on his middle finger.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds accosted Milwaukee starter Cal Eldred for three runs in
the first when Cameron led with a single, stole second and scored
on Sean Casey's single. Larkin ripped his sixth homer over the
right field wall for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin's second error of the season led to a Milwaukee run in
the second, but the Reds barged back for three more runs in the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Avery needed 91 pitches to travel five innings and the blister
forced manager Jack McKeon to take him down for pinch-hitter Mark
Sweeney to lead the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who is expected to be handed a ticket to Triple-A
Indianapolis Friday when the Reds call up left-handed relief
pitcher Ron Villone, lined a single to center - his fifth pinch-hit
in 13 assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Young cleared the right field wall with his first homer to make
it 5-1, Greg Vaughn reached when center fielder Marquis Grissom
dropped his long fly ball and Vaughn scored on Eddie Taubensee's
two-out single. Hal Morris doubled home a run in the eighth and
Tucker clobbered the team's third two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   Avery gave up no earned runs and two hits, then the bullpen was
dead-solid, perfect again.
</P>
<P>
   Dennys Reyes pitched two innings and struck out three, giving
him eight strikeouts over his last four innings without giving up a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sullivan made his sixth appearance in the first seven
games of this homestand and pitched a 1-2-3 eighth and has retired
16 of his last 18 batters, then Gabe White closed the Reds' fun
festivities in the ninth.

CHINA PROTEST KNOCKS OUT WHITE HOUSE WEB SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House site on the World Wide Web has been
overwhelmed _ quite literally _ with e-mail from China protesting
the accidental NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The site was knocked out of commission late Monday afternoon
when the number of electronic messages was more than it could bear,
Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said
Tuesday. It was still down Tuesday evening, said Hammer, who said
he could not predict when it would be in operation again.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was discovered when White House aides could not log
on to the Internet, and it was diagnosed by White House computer
experts, Hammer said. Since the White House site
(www.whitehouse.gov) runs on an independent system, no other White
House computer systems were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer said the web site had been knocked out before for short
periods, but always because of technical problems, never by the
sheer volume of correspondence. He said there was no way to know
how many messages had been sent, but that the enormous volume was a
sign of hope, in a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those users can access and receive our information,'' he
said. ``It works both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   The population of Internet users is growing very rapidly in
China, as almost everywhere else. By some estimates, there are 2.1
million Internet accounts, many with multiple users, in the
country, and some computer authorities predict there will be 4
million accounts by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese hackers invaded and defaced the web site for the U. S.
Embassy in Beijing, the official China Daily reported Tuesday. The
newspaper said the hackers inserted the phrase ``Down With the
Barbarians'' into the embassy's home page and replaced an image of
Ambassador James Sasser with the same phrase in Chinese characters.

 &HT;    Teenager didn't know woman's body was dragged from stolen
vehicle
 &HT;    By Matt Mossman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ A 14-year-old boy charged Tuesday in the
weekend dragging death of 84-year-old Ida Mirel told police he
didn't realize she was stuck under a fleeing getaway car for almost
a quarter-mile.
</P>
<P>
   When Jimmy Lee Williams and two accomplices saw Mirel's mangled
body trailing behind the stolen 1991 Dodge Spirit, they fled onto
Interstate 95, then dumped the car in a Riviera Beach canal,
according to an arrest report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't realize that the victim was under there, but he did
acknowledge that he felt a bump,'' Boca Raton Police Chief Andrew
Scott said Tuesday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Williams after his mother turned him in Sunday,
Scott said. He was charged with homicide, robbery and burglary in
the purse-snatching and dragging, and faces life in jail without
parole if convicted, State Attorney's Office Spokesman Mike
Edmondson said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Williams confessed to yanking Mirel's purse from her
while she was in her car in the parking lot of Wolfie Cohen's
Rascal House, the Boca Raton version of the storied Miami Beach
deli.
</P>
<P>
   Allan and Ida Mirel, who ate there three times a week, were just
leaving Saturday morning, waitress Sylvia Terenzio said. Ida Mirel
had ordered smoked salmon and cream cheese on a bagel.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said detectives are making progress in their search for
Williams' two partners. One is from southern Palm Beach County, and
one is 17 years old, Scott said. He wouldn't release more details.
</P>
<P>
   They are the passenger and driver of the Dodge that ran over Ida
Mirel. After Williams took her purse, she left her car and stood in
front of the Dodge to block their escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a spry woman,'' Terenzio said.
</P>
<P>
   The driver inched forward as if to scare her off before speeding
up and hitting her, a witness told police.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis DellaFave told police he rammed the fleeing Dodge with
his black Acura, but couldn't stop it from escaping onto Executive
Center Drive.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was suspected after Riviera Beach Police, Delray Beach
Police, and the Broward County sheriff's deputies chipped in
information and evidence leading to him. The fingerprints in the
Dodge matched Williams', police said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy also confessed to a purse-snatching Friday outside a
Denny's restaurant, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   If a grand jury approves the charges, Williams will face them as
an adult, Edmondson said. Williams is being held without bond at
the Juvenile Detention Facility in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Mirel's family would not comment, but released a statement
praising the detectives' quick work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We truly appreciate the hard work, dedication, and compassion
shown,'' the family wrote in a fax to police.
</P>
<P>
   At the Rascal House, manager George Burgos said the incident has
spurred talk of increased security. Representatives from the
adjacent Courtyard by Marriott hotel, Rascal House, Houston's and
Macaroni Grill will meet Friday afternoon and have invited police,
hotel manager Jo Luppion said.
</P>
<P>
   In Tallahassee, the Florida Legislature recently passed a bill
to increase the penalty for purse-snatchings from a first-degree
misdemeanor to a second- or third-degree felony. The bill was
sponsored by Sen. Tom Rossin, D-West Palm Beach, and Rep. Debby
Sanderson, D-Fort Lauderdale, whose district includes Boca Raton.

NEW YORK REVISES ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time since 1987, New York state on Tuesday
proposed changing its list of imperiled animals to remove a handful
of creatures that are clearly faring better _ like the Eastern
bluebird _ and to add scores of species of fish, butterflies,
turtles and waterfowl that are now in danger of being wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many more species are now in jeopardy _ listed by
state officials as endangered, threatened or of special concern _
the total number of protected species would leap to 133 from 88,
even after some species came off the list.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Nye, the director of the endangered species unit of the
state Department of Environmental Conservation, said that many new
listings were a result of increased development.
</P>
<P>
   In the good news portion of the proposal, 11 species, including
some of the state's most renowned birds, showed sufficient
improvement to move down a category or drop from the list entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Bald eagles dropped from endangered to threatened, reflecting a
recent sharp rise in the number of pairs nesting in upstate New
York and the Hudson River Valley. The Eastern bluebird, the state
bird, dropped from the list entirely, thanks largely to a burst of
private efforts to build tens of thousands of bluebird houses over
the past decade, Nye said. And the barn owl, a ghostly white-faced
predator, also left the list.
</P>
<P>
   But dozens of other creatures that are less visible but still
important to the ecology were added or moved upward to categories
indicating they were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes to the list reflect changes to the landscape,''
said David Miller, the executive director of the New York chapter
of the National Audubon Society. ``As we add more people and
development, we're going to have more conflicts with species and
our ability to protect biodiversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Several bird species that rely on wetlands or open grasslands
were added to the list of endangered or threatened species,
reflecting a steady loss of these kinds of habitats on Long Island
and in the Hudson River Valley. These include the black rail, which
will now be endangered, and the least bittern, which moved up to
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In a released statement, Gov. George Pataki stressed the good
news about eagles and bluebirds, but also said it was important now
to focus on less flashy creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the species we are adding do not capture our
imagination as easily as the bald eagle,'' he said. ``Nonetheless,
these organisms are important to preserving the biodiversity of our
state.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes will take effect after they are published in the
State Register later this spring and after a 45-day public comment
period. State officials do not expect to make any changes to the
list, which can be found on the Web site of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation: www.dec.state.ny.us.
</P>
<P>
   The new list adds 39 species of insects, mollusks and other
invertebrates, categories that were neglected in past efforts to
determine which species needed protection, Nye said. The new
invertebrate arrivals include the dwarf wedgemussel, a mussel whose
New York range is limited to the Neversink River, and Hessel's
hairstreak, a butterfly that lives only in Atlantic white cedar
swamps.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of so many inconspicuous animals reflects current
thinking by biologists on the best strategies for preserving
ecosystems _ working from the bottom of the chain of complexity
upward instead of focusing on so-called flagship species, like
eagles or bobcats.
</P>
<P>
   The state's endangered species law went into effect in 1970,
paralleling the Federal Endangered Species Act, although lacking
some of that law's punch.
</P>
<P>
   When a species is listed by the state as endangered or
threatened, it cannot be killed or its habitat destroyed without
permission of state environmental officials. Violators can be fined
$1,000, with an added penalty of $250 for each affected creature.
But because the law is difficult to enforce, fines are rare.

JAMES HUMES, 74; PERFORMED JFK AUTOSPY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Fla., Mich.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. James J. Humes, one of two Navy pathologists who performed
the autopsy on President John F. Kennedy, died May 6 at his home in
Ponte Vedra, Fla. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, his son James Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   Humes and his colleague, Dr. Thornton Boswell, concluded that
Kennedy had been struck by only two bullets, fired from above and
behind, and that he had been killed when one exploded in his skull.
</P>
<P>
   Through the cloud of conspiracy theories put forward after the
1963 assassination, Humes and Boswell stayed mostly silent, even
when critics contended that they had had insufficient experience
with gunshot wounds. An Army pathologist, Dr. Pierre Finck agreed
with the Navy pathologists' conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, in interviews published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, Humes and Boswell affirmed their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the continuing controversy over Kennedy's killing,
James Humes Jr. said Monday, ``My father did not want people to
profit from the tragedy of an American president's death by
sensationalism,'' like the writing of books to advance conspiracy
theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Humes rose to be the Navy's director of laboratories, based at
Bethesda Naval Hospital, where the Kennedy autopsy was performed.
He retired from the Navy as a captain in 1967 and was awarded the
Legion of Merit decoration.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, he was president of the American Society of
Clinical Pathologists, of the College of American Pathology and of
the Association of Clinical Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Humes was born in Philadelphia. He graduated from St. Joseph's
Preparatory School there and attended St. Joseph's University and
Villanova University, both in Pennsylvania. He joined the Navy in
its V-12 program and received his medical degree from Jefferson
Medical College in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the Navy, he served as medical director and
as director of laboratories at St. John Hospital in Detroit. He
later was a clinical professor of pathology at the University of
Florida Health Service Center in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his son James J. Jr., of Chicago, he is survived by his
wife of 49 years, the former Ann Mary Harrington; four other sons,
Jeffrey, of Wallington, Fla., Gerald, of Ann Arbor, Mich., Philip,
of Douglasville, Ga., and Kenneth, of Miami; two daughters, Alyce
Marie Greider of Jacksonville Beach, Fla., and Ann Mary Sansbury of
Windemere, Fla., and nine grandchildren.  &QL;

   ATLANTA _ Ongoing budget deficits at Georgia Public Broadcasting
during the past several years are projected to top $7 million by
this summer and could cause problems for the state agency in paying
vendors and meeting payroll, according to a draft report issued
Tuesday by the state auditor.

which operates Atlanta's WGTV and 22 other TV and radio stations,
suffers from ``systemic management problems.''
</P>

   Lack of appropriate controls ``has created a climate that would
allow fraud and abuse to occur with little chance of being
detected,'' State Auditor Claude Vickers wrote in an 11-page letter
to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he will withhold specific comment until he has had
time to fully review the auditor's interim findings. However,
Barnes indicated that problems pointed out in the draft report
won't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make sure anything in state government operates
in a businesslike manner. I want to make sure we remedy any
situation that exists,'' said Barnes, who released the preliminary
report to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Werner Rogers, the agency's executive director, said he plans to
ask for a meeting with the auditor before Vickers issues his final
report. He said the auditing team that prepared the draft didn't
meet with him or his deputy during their most recent three-week
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said he disagreed with several conclusions in the draft,
notably the prediction that the agency would have trouble paying
its vendors or staff by the end of the fiscal year on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't anticipate not being able to pay vendors or meet our
payrolls,'' Rogers said. ``We're not concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The report predicts the agency will run in the red for the third
straight year by spending $1.7 million more than it takes in during
the fiscal year ending June 30. That will increase its deficit to a
projected $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Without elaborating, the report said the deficit will create
``significant cash flow problems in paying vendors and meeting
employee payrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers blamed the red ink on higher dues charged by the Public
Broadcasting Service and payments on a $4.5 million loan for
telecommunications equipment. PBS raised the agency's dues from $3
million to $5 million the year it moved into a new $45 million
headquarters on 14th Street, Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the report said Georgia Public Broadcasting gets annual
funding from the federal Corporation for Public Broadcasting that
nearly offsets the PBS dues.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes acknowledged Georgia Public Broadcasting's arguments that
the cost of operating the new building and additional dues to
public radio have had an impact on the agency's revenue stream, but
he appeared unwilling to accept that rationale as the principal
cause of the agency's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to examine that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also states that the agency used public funds for
unnecessary or questionable expenditures and failed to properly
safeguard expensive parts and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings, the report found the agency had:
</P>
<P>
   _ Used $442,000 in state funds to pay a private firm to provide
PeachStar, a distance-learning program, for 475 out-of-state
students.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paid $472,350 to another private firm for which it has no
written contract.
</P>
<P>
   _ Made travel advances of more than $25,000 for which it did not
maintain records from those who received the money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Held $613,000 in accounts receivable which are more than nine
months old as of March 31.
</P>
<P>
   _ Renewed without rebidding a $790,000 contract with a private
firm to operate a PeachStar ``help desk'' and to provide extended
warranty coverage for satellite dishes and equipment used to
provide the program.
</P>
<P>
   The agency intends to explain many of the items cited, Rogers
said. For example, he said, the agency chose to renegotiate rather
than rebid $790,000 contract and won a $110,000 price cut.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers also said the report failed to properly acknowledge the
success the agency has had in correcting problems cited in previous
audit reports.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wouldn't discuss the possibility of top management
changes at Georgia Public Broadcasting.

MOTOROLA PLANS TO SELL LOW-END CHIP UNIT TO TEXAS PACIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after a group of former executives announced an ambitious
buyout bid for Motorola's low-end chip business, the company said
it's already sewn up a $1.6 billion deal to sell the division to a
Texas buyout firm.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola Inc. said Tuesday it plans to sell its Phoenix-based
Semiconductor Components Group to Texas Pacific Group, the
investment vehicle of prominent financier David Bonderman.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement apparently quashes a competing bid from an
obscure Tempe company created by former Motorola executives seeking
to buy the division, which has 10,000 employees, including 2,500 in
the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   While the principals of TFG Acquisition Corp. say they will make
a counter offer of $1.76 billion, Motorola says it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is done; it's over,'' said Bob Growney, Motorola
president and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have suspected for months that the world's No. 3
chipmaker would sell off the group that makes low-end chips for
everything from household appliances to cars.
</P>
<P>
   The commodities component division has fallen outside of
Motorola's strategy to concentrate on customized chips that bring
in fatter profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to
become final in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Pacific Group and Motorola promise the buyout will bring
few changes to Phoenix where the new company will keep its
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Motorola culminated a massive restructuring that
slashed 2,075 jobs from its divisions throughout the Valley. The
semiconductor group took the brunt of the cuts, losing 1,400
positions.
</P>
<P>
   The new company plans to add rather than cut jobs, said Texas
Pacific principal Dipanjan Deb.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the hard (restructuring) work has been done,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The sale could be a boon to the Valley, said Ray Jodoin, senior
analyst with the market research firm Cahners In-Stat Group in
Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could end up being very good with a management group that
wants to take what Motorola considered old technology and make it
grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some warned that more cost cutting may come if the new
investors are seeking a quick jump in profits. ``Motorola has moved
in the past couple of years to implement cost cuts,'' said Dale
Pfau, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer. ``As a private company,
they are able to make changes more rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping to ease the transition, Texas Pacific officials said
they would keep the management team that ran the division for
Motorola including 28-year veteran Steve Hanson, who will be
president of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are creating here is the No. 1-largest supplier of
semiconductor components in the industry,'' Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers and applause erupted after local employees learned of the
change Tuesday, Hanson said.
</P>
<P>
   But some workers, including eight-year Motorola employee Dave
Rimer, said the changes caused them concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would force us to re-evaluate our work situation and decide
if we want to stay with the company or move,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have nervously questioned the fate of the division
since Motorola said nine months ago that it was considering selling
the business.
</P>
<P>
   Growney said about five groups approached Motorola to talk about
buying the division that has suffered in recent years the largest
drop in orders and sales within its $7.3 billion semiconductor
division.
</P>
<P>
   After weighing how a sale would affect employees, customers and
shareholders and whether the suitor had the financial backing to
close the deal quickly, Motorola decided to move foward with the
Texas Pacific offer.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout group, which last year acquired ZiLOG Inc., a
producer of chips used in TV remote controls and telephone
answering machines, gravitated to the division for a couple of
reasons. It's somewhat resistant to the dramatic boom and bust
cycles that define the chip industry and it demands less capital
spending than other semiconductor businesses, Deb said.
</P>
<P>
   The offer ranks as Texas Pacific's largest deal yet.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the proposed transaction, Motorola would receive
$1.6 billion in cash, notes and about 10 percent of the stock of
the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street responded favorably to the news. Motorola stock
touched a record 86 1/2 Tuesday to close at 85 7/8, up 4.
</P>
<P>
   TFG Acquisitions, which incorporated in February, apparantly
caught wind of the Bonderman group's offer and revealed Monday its
own $1.6 billion bid for the components group.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Harris, TFG vice president, said Tuesday that it would
boost its offering price to $1.76 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've upped the ante on this enough that Motorola can afford
to get out of the (Texas Pacific) agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola board has considered its options and made its
decision, Growney said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Pacific will own the sector's buildings on 52nd Street and
McDowell Road, however Motorola will retain the 105 acres of
property and lease them back to the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The campus is a federal Superfund site, a designation acquired
after pollutants and other chemicals from the plant seeped into
groundwater, sparking numerous lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola is working to clean up the site and will continue its
efforts until they are complete, said Motorola spokesman Bill
Seiferth. &QL;

 &HT;    Georgia public television in crisis, auditor warns

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ongoing budget deficits at Georgia Public Broadcasting
during the past several years are projected to top $7 million by
this summer and could cause problems for the state agency in paying
vendors and meeting payroll, according to a draft report issued
Tuesday by the state auditor.
</P>
<P>
   The report to Gov. Roy Barnes states that the state agency,
which operates Atlanta's WGTV and 22 other TV and radio stations,
suffers from ``systemic management problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of appropriate controls ``has created a climate that would
allow fraud and abuse to occur with little chance of being
detected,'' State Auditor Claude Vickers wrote in an 11-page letter
to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said he will withhold specific comment until he has had

Barnes indicated that problems pointed out in the draft report

ANGELS' SLOW START NO SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's pitching-starved edition of The Sporting Muse:
</P>
<P>
   Angels fans who check the American League standings daily
shouldn't look first at their deficit behind Texas. They should
instead note their team is only a half-game better than the
wretched Orioles and rank 12th in the 14 team A.L.
</P>
<P>
   This was as predictable as a Tim Belcher fifth-inning eruption.
The Angels entered the season with the same uncertain pitching
staff as they concluded 1998, and it is living down to
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   One only has to look at what happened to Seattle last season to
see where the Angels are headed in '99. The Mariners' unsettled
pitching needs, accented by Randy Johnson's contract situation, led
to a slow start that neither Ken Griffey nor Alex Rodriguez could
overcome.
</P>
<P>
   If that duo couldn't makeup for horrid pitching, why should we
expect any better from Tim Salmon and Mo Vaughn? ...
</P>
<P>
   Am I the only person surprised that the Dodgers' Gary Sheffield
convened a players-only team meeting because the team was playing
lackadaisically?
</P>
<P>
   It's great that Sheffield is involved in the team process, but
of all the Dodgers contributing to an inconsistent start, his play
seemed as lackadaisical as anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have all been guilty of too much talk about effort
and solidarity. They need to stop talking and start acting like
their play is the most important thing in their lives. ...
</P>
<P>
   News item: Pete Rose becomes hitting coach for an independent
minor league team. Reaction: Pete should stop staging these minor
playlets regarding his love for baseball and do the one thing he
has yet to do admit he made a huge mistake betting on baseball and
beg forgiveness. ...
</P>
<P>
   Paul Silas, who just signed a multiyear deal to coach the
Charlotte Hornets, has set what has to be a world record for
longest span between head coaching jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Silas was named interim coach earlier this year when Dave Cowens
quit, 16 seasons after being fired by the Clippers after the
1982-83 season. This is just the latest testimony to the black hole
that is Clippers basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Silas wasn't ready to be a head coach when he was hired in
1980-81, scant months after retiring as a player. He won 36, 17 and
25 games in three years, the Clips' last years in San Diego before
moving north. But waiting 16 years before another opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   All those who find themselves in Clipperland are united in their
desire to get out. But checking Silas' record made me scan the
archives to see if anyone ever has accomplished anything after
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper signed with Chicago as a free agent for the 1994-95
season, then hit the lottery when Michael Jordan returned from
baseball. Bill Walton played with the Clips for one season (1985),
then was traded to Boston, which won a title in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for the success stories. Michael Cage? He got to the
Western Conference finals once. Charles Smith? Retired without
success. Danny Manning? Dogged by injuries. Brent Barry? Cut loose
by Miami and booed by Bulls fans. Larry Brown? Got as close as the
Eastern finals one year in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Clippers are like a virus that never leaves
your body. ...
</P>
<P>
   I like Scottie Pippen, but if I own the Houston Rockets, I'm
disappointed with his performance and what he's done for the team.
It probably doesn't help that Pippen and Charles Barkley seem to be
working independently of each other. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Pistons' play this season and in the playoffs (0-2)
should make it very easy for Grant Hill to jump to the Bulls as a
free agent this offseason assuming Grant wants the attention that
will come from being the first team leader after Michael Jordan.
...
</P>
<P>
   With Dennis Rodman out of the game, the only thing seemingly
standing between Alonzo Mourning and the greatness expected of him
would be his long-time tormentor, the Knicks. If 'Zo can outlast
New York's thuggery, maybe this is Miami's turn to at least make
the finals. ...
</P>
<P>
   Watching Long Beach State's men's volleyball team last week
rammed home two unique points. One, the sport of volleyball has
reached the point where it can turn a profit for colleges with
powerful programs.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Ratelle said the Mountain Pacific federation has stockpiled
$1000,000 from its last three tournaments. The NCAA in the past has
used money losses as a reason for limiting the size of the playoff
field, Ratelle said, ``but they can't use that excuse any longer,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He would like to see regional tournaments, a la women's
volleyball, that would give more teams an opportunity to play for a
Final Four berth. As it stands now, two conferences outside the
west get automatic berths whether they are deserved or not.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, men's volleyball is suffering from gender inequity.
The point of Title IX was to offer the same opportunities to women
sports-wise as they were the men. But the process of raising those
standards have come at the expense of men's program, and often in
the same sport, like volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Ratelle only has 4{ scholarships to go around, while Brian
Gimmillaro has 11 for his women's team. The presence of nine
Californians and not a single player from Utah on the BYU roster is
an example of the talent that leaves the state each year because of
scholarship limitations. ...
</P>
<P>
   The odds are 1-20 that Bob Baffert will enter his other filly,
the outstanding Silverbulletday, in the Preakness this weekend.
There's good depth in the 1999 3-year-old field, but few standouts.
Baffert openly second-guessed his decision to have her run (and
win) the Kentucky Oaks the day before the derby. ...
</P>
<P>
   News item: Pete Sampras struggles on clay court in the Italian
tourney prep for French Open. Reaction: Why doesn't Sampras just
bag Paris once and for all? Being unable to win on clay doesn't
diminish the other 11 grand slam titles he's won. Indeed, why does
anyone play on clay?

MYSTERY BIDDER PUSHES UP PRICES AT SOTHEBY'S IMPRESSIONIST AUCTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mystery telephone bidder known only to the audience
as L036 went on a wild shopping spree at Sotheby's sale of
Impressionist and modern art Monday night, spending nearly $25
million for three Monets, a Rodin, a Sisley and a Signac. That was
all it took to push prices for some offerings way above what many
experts said they were worth.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the evening was a total success. There were
eerily quiet stretches where the crowded salesroom went dead. Then
there were moments of tension, when several buyers were determined
to bring something home, no matter what the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's sale totaled $55.5 million, below Sotheby's
pre-sale estimate of $74 million to $102 millon. Of the 48 lots on
offer, 18 works failed to sell.
</P>
<P>
   These figures were a letdown after the high of Monday evening
when Sotheby's was hopping with bids for the 50 artworks from the
estate of Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the philanthropist and
socialite who died last year. The evening made a total of $128.3
million.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the works at the Whitney sale, what was on offer
Monday night had little in the way of distinguished provenances and
many were familiar to auctiongoers since they had been in sales not
that long ago.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's two most expensive paintings were being sold by
the Nahmad family, Lebanese dealers who run galleries in New York
and London and who have been among Sotheby's and Christie's biggest
buyers for years now.
</P>
<P>
   The Nahmads owned the evening's top seller, Monet's ``Haystack''
(1891), a single haystack that was included in an exhibition of 15
haystack paintings at the Durand-Ruel Gallery in Paris the year it
was painted. The painting was estimated at $8 million to $12
million; it sold for $11.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Nahmads, however, were not as successful with
Toulouse-Lautrec's ``Red-Haired Woman Seated in Mr. Forest's
Garden,'' (1889) a portrait of a young seamstress that was
estimated at between $6 million and $8 million. It failed to sell,
becoming one of the evening's biggest casualties. No one was
willing to pay more than $4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   This is a big week for Monets: between Sotheby's and Christie's,
13 are up for sale. Last night Sotheby's had six on offer. L036
bought two of them: ``Waterloo Bridge in the Fog'' (1889-1903) for
$6.1 million, and ``The Custom House, in the Morning'' (1882) for
$1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not every Monet sold; the artist's ``Rouen Cathedral: The
Courtyard of Albane'' (1892), was expected to bring $1 million to
$1.5 million. Bidding stopped at $850,000. Not a bid came from the
room.
</P>
<P>
   Other Impressionist offerings that failed to sell include:
Pissarro's ``Saint-Sever Pier at Rouen'' (1896), estimated at $1.5
million to $2 million; Degas' ``Woman at Her Dressing Table''
(1895-1900), for which bidding stopped at $2.2 million, under its
low $3 million estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Besides works that failed to sell, some were mysteriously
withdrawn. Hours before the sale, Bonnard's ``Interior,'' (1913)
was withdrawn at the request of the Rosenberg family, who believe
the painting may have been stolen by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Rosenberg, a leading Parisian art dealer in 1940, had other
works plundered by German occupation forces, and last month the
French government returned a 1904 Monet, one of the ``Waterlilies''
series, to his heirs. ``Sotheby's is cooperating with both parties
and hopes for a speedy resolution,'' Matthew Weigman, a Sotheby's
spokesman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Two still lifes were withdrawn, one by Cezanne and one by
Picasso; no reason was given.
</P>
<P>
   Two other Bonnards were up for sale. ``The Woman in the Tub
(Woman Crouching in a Tub)'' (1912) sold to an unidentified
telephone bidder for $1.8 million, just at its low estimate. A
later painting, ``The Daily Accounting''(1924) was bought by
Abigail Asher, a private dealer, for its high estimate of $1.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fair price,'' said Ms. Asher. ``People were prepared
to stretch for good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Diana D. Brooks, Sotheby's chief executive, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous amount of interest out there but the
market is very discriminating. If estimates are too aggressive,
people know it. But if it's something someone loves, they'll go for
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 plus 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.

 MISSOURI HOUSE OKs BILL BANNING `PARTIAL-BIRTH' ABORTIONS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY _ A bill that would criminalize a certain
abortion procedure cleared its final legislative hurdle Tuesday
when the House approved it 127-29.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed the Senate last week, goes to Gov. Mel
Carnahan, who is expected to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Backers said the measure is designed to ban ``partial birth''
abortions by classifying them as infanticide. The procedure would
be a felony unless it was done to save the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan has said he will not veto the bill before the session
adjourns this week. Legislators say they will try to override his
action at their annual veto session, which starts Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   But an early count shows they could prevail in the end, unlike
two years ago, when Carnahan vetoed a similar measure and
supporters of that bill narrowly missed an override.
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors need 109 votes in the House to overcome a veto. If the
bill's 116 sponsors stick by the bill, the House would have the
votes needed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the bill 27-6 after more than 38 hours of
debate; 23 of those votes would be needed to overcome a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hailed the passage of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is very clear,'' said Rep. Vicky Hartzler, a
Harrisonville Republican. ``It bans a hideous procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Luetkenhaus, a Josephville Democrat, said the bill had
the support of 25 of the 40 women in General Assembly who voted on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   He said his proposal was not designed to make all abortions
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent is, these are human beings and should be protected
once the birthing process begins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics, including Planned Parenthood, say outlawing
all abortions is just what the bill seems to do. They say the bill
is riddled with flaws, including the absence of a provision to
allow such abortions to protect a woman's health.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barbara Fraser, a St. Louis Democrat, was among those who
charged that the legislation would ban all abortions. The bill's
prohibition against killing a ``living infant'' is too broad, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not make it clear when one commits the act of
infanticide,'' Fraser said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. May Scheve, a St. Louis County Democrat, said doctors took
steps that were ``medically necesssary'' when her blood pressure
plummeted in the birth of her son 18 weeks ago. Although everything
turned out fine, she said the experience pointed up the need for
laws protecting a woman's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It risks the health and lives of real women,'' Scheve said of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the bill contend that a health exception would be
abused and make the bill meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Luetkenhaus said backers went to great lengths to answer
opponents' concerns. A provision in his bill attempts to defuse
criticism by exempting from charges ``any person who performs or
attempts to perform a legal abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents said that the measure was suspicious because it did
not even describe a ``partial birth'' abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Backers said they only wanted to ban the procedure that calls
for the partial, feet-first extraction of the fetus. The barely
visible skull is then punctured with scissors and the brain is
drained before the skull is collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Carnahan labeled the legislation
``totally deceitful.'' He said it was really aimed at overturning
the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made abortions legal.
</P>
<P>
   Lou DeFeo, general counsel for the Missouri Catholic Conference,
said this year's bill had a better chance of taking effect over the
governor's veto than the 1997 measure did.

COURT DECISION UPSETS SCHOOL DISTRICT MEASURE FOR KIRYAS JOEL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York state's highest court Tuesday declared unconstitutional
the third and latest legislative effort to create a special public
school district for the disabled children of the Hasidic village of
Kiryas Joel, saying that it still amounted to ``preferring one
religion over others.''
</P>
<P>
   But a vigorous dissent by three judges of the state Court of
Appeals suggested that the decade-old case, which has produced 10
court rulings, was not over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intractable drama of this dispute has a David and Goliath
staging to it _ yet it is difficult to decide who will be left
standing in the end as the true victor or hero,'' Judge Joseph W.
Bellacosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Weider, the mayor of Kiryas Joel, a village of 15,000
Satmar Hasidic Jews in Orange County, said it was considering
appealing for a second time to the U.S. Supreme Court or returning
to the state Legislature for a fourth time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Kiryas Joel persuaded the Legislature to carve out a
special public school district from surrounding Monroe-Woodbury,
contending that the village's 250 handicapped children felt
uncomfortable attending secular classes.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's first law was declared unconstitutional by
several courts, including the Supreme Court, which found that the
law written explicitly for Kiryas Joel by name amounted to a favor
for a single religious group.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's second effort, in 1994, did not name Kiryas
Joel but was thrown out by succeeding courts because the law's
criteria of wealth and population applied only to Kiryas Joel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Legislature tried for a third time and slightly
broadened the criteria. But the lower courts found that this
version applied to only two of the state 1,545 municipalities _
Kiryas Joel and the town of Stony Point in Rockland County.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a four-judge majority of the Court of Appeals agreed,
finding that the law, known as Chapter 390, did not meet the
Supreme Court's test of neutrality toward religion.
</P>
<P>
   Weider, a businessman who has led the battle to sustain the
public school, was heartened by the dissent. ``It's a 4-3 decision,
which is better than it's ever been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joseph Waldman, a Kiryas Joel dissident who opposes the
school, said the village was also trying to retain control of the
school taxes its residents pay and millions of dollars in federal
and state programs for remedial, bilingual and transportation
programs.
</P>
<P>
   If the Legislature and the Supreme Court refuse to intervene,
the State Education Department could close the district in the next
few weeks and force the surrounding Monroe-Woodbury district to
provide special education classes for the handicapped at the
village's religious schools, said Jay Worona, general counsel for
the New York state School Boards Association, which brought the
litigation against Kiryas Joel.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe-Woodbury, however, has resisted absorbing Kiryas Joel
because it would add a large bloc of voters who do not send
children to public schools and might stymie spending increases.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, who supported the latest Kiryas Joel
legislation, declined comment. Pat Lynch, speaking for Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, said Silver was ``committed to finding a
mechanism'' to meet ``the educational needs of this group of
disabled youngsters.''

   &UR; WINONA M. LIPMAN, 67, VETERAN IN THE NEW JERSEY STATE SENATE &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Wynona M. Lipman, who in 1971 became the first
African-American woman to be elected to the New Jersey Senate, died
Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, her office said.
</P>
<P>
   Lipman, a Democrat who represented Newark, was the
longest-serving member of the state Senate. For 27 years she
championed the causes of women, minority groups, children and small
businesses. One bill she sponsored that became law increased
penalties for adults who patronize under-age prostitutes. Another
broadened the statutes on domestic violence to protect more victims
and increase services to the children of troubled families.
</P>
<P>
   She sat on the governor's Council on AIDS, the Task Force on
Child Abuse and Neglect and the New Jersey Court Team on Domestic
Violence.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Georgia, she was educated at Talladega College,
Tulane University and Columbia University, where she received a
doctorate in philosophy on a Rockefeller Grant. She studied at the
Sorbonne as a Fulbright scholar and taught high school. While
serving in the Senate, she was also an associate professor at Essex
County College.
</P>
<P>
   For years she was not only the sole black but also the lone
woman in a house she called a ``men's club'' some years ago. She
held ranking positions on important committees, including those
dealing with human services, the budget and appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   Lipman's survivors include her daughter, Karyne Anne Lipman of
Atlanta, and a sister, Eloise Ransome of Virginia.

   &UR; NORMAN WEISSMAN, 74, EX-HEAD OF AGENCY &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Norman Weissman, a former president of the Ruder Finn
public relations agency in New York, died on Sunday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cancer, according to a statement from
Norman Weissman Inc., the firm he most recently headed, in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he had also served as chairman of Citigate
Communications, a subsidiary of the British firm of the same name,
and as vice chairman of the GCI Group, a subsidiary of Grey
Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his career was spent at Ruder Finn, which he joined in
1958 when it was known as Ruder &AMP; Finn. He served as the agency's
president from 1969 to 1986. He was also Ruder Finn's foreign
specialist, handling clients that included Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, the Jamaica Tourist Board and the government of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, he worked four years as editor of a trade magazine, and
three years for the City of New York's Department of Air Pollution
Control, where he was in charge of public relations.
</P>
<P>
   He received his bachelor's degree from Rutgers University in
1949 and a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin in
1951.
</P>
<P>
   Weissman is survived by his son, Lee, of Manhattan and a
brother, Seymour, of Verona, N.J.

EDITORIAL: CONFRONTING THE SPEAKER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   The fate of campaign finance reform is in the hands of a few
dozen Republican moderates afraid to stand up for what they
believe. That much is clear from the refusal of House Republicans
who support the Shays-Meehan ``soft money'' ban to sign a petition
forcing the bill to the floor. At a meeting with Speaker Dennis
Hastert last week, many of these Republicans asked for a vote
before midsummer. The speaker said he would think about it. A week
has gone by, and he has not gotten back to them. With 191 Democrats
on board to bring the legislation to a vote, it would take only 27
Republican signatures, out of 59 Republican supporters of the bill,
to let the vote take place.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker has been all over the calendar in predicting when a
vote could come. First he said next year, then the end of
September. Tuesday the House majority leader, Dick Armey, said it
should come in late July. That would still be too late. There is no
reason a vote on campaign reform cannot be scheduled this month or
next. But if the House leaders insist on July, they must guarantee
that a vote takes place then, not just a debate. The need is urgent
because the legislation, which would ban unregulated soft-money
donations to parties by corporations, unions and rich individuals,
must be passed quickly to leave time to block a Republican-led
filibuster in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert is cultivating an image of openness, flexibility and
putting the House ``back on track,'' as Alison Mitchell reports in
The Times Tuesday. But he should not be given more than a few more
days to make up his mind about scheduling a vote. He made his own
parochial interests clear when he said last week that he had
``serious concerns'' about the Shays-Meehan bill. Translation: He
fears it would cut off a large chunk of special-interest funds that
have corrupted both parties in the last several years. But the
speaker's obligation now is not to his own party's narrow financial
interests. It is to let the majority of the house give Americans
the reforms they have yearned for since the fund-raising scandals
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert keeps saying that appropriations bills must be taken up
before campaign finance reform. But the appropriations bills will
probably stir up a time-consuming battle and may not get approved
until the end of the year. The speaker is also reported to have
told fellow Republicans that he regrets his passivity in failing to
push for passage of a resolution supporting the use of military
action in Yugoslavia. He can demonstrate true leadership this time
by letting the principled members of his party have the vote they
want.
</P>
<P>
   The main Republican sponsor of the reform bill, Christopher
Shays of Connecticut, has taken a back seat in the drive to press
the speaker. Two other respected Republicans, Marge Roukema of New
Jersey and Zach Wamp of Tennessee, have taken the initiative. Mrs.
Roukema was right to say that Hastert would be inviting a ``big
problem'' if he did not yield. These declarations are not threats.
They are a restatement of principle. Without the tenacity of these
few dozen Republican lawmakers, campaign reform will die. It is
that simple.

JUDGE ACCUSES SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OF CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA _ In a blistering opinion Tuesday, a Shawnee County judge
said crime and corruption had permeated the Shawnee County
Sheriff's Department to such an extent that scores of drug cases
may have to be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the ruling dismissing drug charges against one
defendant, District Attorney Joan Hamilton said she will file
ouster proceedings against Shawnee County Sheriff Dave Meneley.
That could come by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that we'll have any alternative but to file it
because of the court's ruling and to ensure that we can get the
credibility back in the department and the cases worked,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A recall petition drive already is under way. If enough
signatures are collected, Shawnee County voters will decide whether
to remove Meneley.
</P>
<P>
   If Hamilton files an action to oust the sheriff, the matter will
be decided in District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Because of missing evidence from the sheriff's evidence holding
areas, Judge Eric Rosen dismissed drug charges against Carlos
Hernandez on Tuesday, saying it now is impossible to prove the case
against the Topeka man.
</P>
<P>
   The Hernandez case included extensive testimony about drug use
by a former sheriff's deputy, missing drug evidence and a
departmentwide coverup.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said similar evidence problems may exist with 106
Sheriff's Department drug cases from 1994, 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime and corruption that occurred within the Shawnee
County Sheriff's Department and has been allowed to continue to
exist by the willful blindness, if not outright support, of several
supervisory and higher echelon employees of the Shawnee County
Sheriff's Department, including the sheriff himself, precludes the
defendant from receiving the fair trial that he is guaranteed by
law,'' Rosen wrote in his 74-page decision.
</P>
<P>
   Meneley, who already has been charged with two counts of perjury
stemming from his testimony in the Hernandez case concerning the
alleged coverup of drugs missing in his department, dismissed
Rosen's allegations as ``one man's opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges aren't gods,'' he said. ``They make mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton said she has yet to determine how many of the 106 cases
Rosen cited resulted in charges being filed or convictions being
obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who filed the perjury charges against Meneley, one of
his deputies and a former deputy, said, ``Something has to be done
to change the Sheriff's Department unless we want criminals
to...walk out.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about his possible resignation,
Meneley said, ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the judge's opinion will have an impact on the
day-to-day operations of his office, he said, ``No, we'll continue
to work as we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen wrote that a former sheriff's narcotics officer, Timothy
Oblander, had a drug addiction and was using cocaine and other
drugs he obtained from evidence holding areas while working for the
sheriff. Oblander resigned in late February and admitted to a
cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Oblander's partner, Sgt. Frank Good, ``knew of this behavior and
was an enabler in Oblander's procuring drugs and in hiding this
activity,'' Rosen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to write that at least since June 1995, ``Meneley
knew of the use of cocaine and other drugs and thereafter became
personally involved in covering up this activity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen termed the department's conduct ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inconceivable that the persons charged with the duty of
protecting society and enforcing the law are not only breaking the
law themselves but have engaged in a departmentwide conspiracy to
conceal the illegal conduct,'' the judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Rosen wrote that Meneley, ``through calculated investigative
indifference and purposeful personnel promotions, transfers and
demotions, attempted to keep this illegal activity secret within
his department.''
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff, in testimony in the Hernandez case, denied knowing
of his deputy's drug addiction, the stealing of drugs from the
property room or any attempt to cover up the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Meneley said he was particularly upset that the judge painted
his entire department with a broad brush, indicating that every
officer was corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``To paint this whole department as a corrupt department is
absolutely asinine,'' Meneley said. ``He has no evidence of that.
Absolutely none whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   In his conclusion, Rosen wrote that the court cannot let
misconduct by law-enforcement officers to be ignored and excused
while citizens are convicted of similar crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decency, security and the liberty interests of all our
citizens are threatened by the circumstances surrounding this
case,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The matters brought before this court are shocking and
represent egregious violations of the right of a defendant to a
fair trail. They strain our judicial system and mock the ideal of
justice under the law. They shake not only public confidence in the
system but the system itself.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: DAYS OF PROTEST AND REMEMBRANCE AT STANFORD
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif.)  (nk) 
 By PHILIP TAUBMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanford University is tranquil this spring, graced by the
brilliant sunshine and eucalyptus fragrance that help give the
campus its distinctive California accent. Long gone are the sights
and sounds of my undergraduate days three decades ago _ windows
shattering in the night, tear-gas canisters exploding, the
president's office in flames.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with considerable curiosity that I returned to campus
last weekend to attend a reunion of the anti-war movement that did
so much to transform Stanford into a political battleground in the
late 1960s. What, I wondered, had become of the students who had
spent their college years resisting the war in Vietnam and
Stanford's links to it? What, if any, vestiges of the movement
could be found on campus today?
</P>
<P>
   A weekend gathering of 100 or so people can only begin to
provide answers, but what I found was not entirely what I expected.
Perhaps most of the investment bankers, venture capitalists and
Silicon Valley millionaires stayed home, but by and large the men
and women who attended the reunion were engaged in work directly
connected to the values they had embraced in opposing the war.
There were labor organizers, environmental activists, public health
specialists, teachers and urban affairs experts. But the discourse
seemed stale, as though a time capsule sealed in 1969 had been
opened and the political tracts in it applied to the world today.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this was not a standard college reunion.
Instead of red Stanford banners and tailgate picnics, there were
faded manifestoes and impassioned arguments about American foreign
policy. No one from the university showed up to solicit donations,
which was just as well, since more than a few participants had
devoted so much time to protesting that they never completed their
undergraduate requirements. One person reported that he had finally
graduated in 1984. I collected my diploma a year late because of
hours spent covering demonstrations for The Stanford Daily.
</P>
<P>
   Current students scarcely noticed the reunion, which was
understandable on a sparkling May weekend that was ideal for going
to the beach, hiking in the foothills or starting a new Internet
company, which seems to be a favorite campus activity.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion marked roughly the 30th anniversary of the largest,
gentlest and most thoughtful anti-war action at Stanford in the
1960s. It was the nine-day occupation in April 1969 of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, a center for classified, military-related
research.
</P>
<P>
   No one realized it at the time, but the peaceful protest,
supported by hundreds of students and many faculty members, was the
high-water mark of nonviolent civil disobedience at the university.
A month later students ransacked an administration building and
police were summoned to clear it, beginning a destructive spiral of
violence that convulsed Stanford for several years.
</P>
<P>
   It is clearly hard for today's students to fathom the passions
and political action that were unleashed by the Vietnam War and the
draft. The biggest cause at Stanford this spring was an effort by
students at Berkeley to save an ethnic studies program that the
University of California was threatening to disband.
</P>
<P>
   Several students who addressed the reunion talked about the
difficulty of rallying support for any cause. ``Oh, I could do so
much with 20 people,'' sighed Sarah Faye McMullen, after one '60s
alumnus recalled the disappointment when only 20 students showed up
for an early Vietnam protest. All five of the undergraduate
panelists were women, and they pointedly complained about how few
men are involved in political activities. I'm not sure they fully
believed another former protester who declared, ``We thought we
were going to change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   His words reminded me of the deadly serious essay I wrote for
Life magazine as a student, condemning my parents' generation for
producing a materialistic, morally bankrupt world my classmates and
I would have to fix. My father, a good-humored man, was restrained
in his response.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the weekend was devoted to discussion of the war in
Yugoslavia, starting with a fiery denunciation of the NATO air
strikes by Marjorie Cohn. She was an anti-war leader in 1969 and is
now a professor at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego.
She attacked the Balkan war as another case of American imperialism
and defended Serbia, saying the United States ``will protect its
markets and international influence at the expense of whatever
small country happens to get in the way.'' She barely mentioned the
brutal Serbian assault on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   I liked Marjorie when we were fellow students, and admired her
sense of compassion and fair play. But as she wound through her
peroration, ending with ``Power to the People!'' I thought I had
entered a time warp. I was surprised how many of our contemporaries
agreed with her. What saddened me was not the opposition to the
NATO air war, though I disagree, but the hollowness of the
critique. Surely those who courageously opposed the Vietnam War can
do better today than align themselves with Slobodan Milosevic.

EDITORIAL: TEMPEST IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, May 12:
</P>
<P>
   As if the war in Yugoslavia were not complicated enough,
President Clinton must now deal with an infuriated China as he
tries to fashion a political settlement in the Balkans. That is
just one of several serious problems facing Clinton in the
aftermath of last week's mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
Belgrade. Another is China itself, which showed an ominously
volatile side in its response to the accidental attack. In his six
years as president, Clinton has not faced a more difficult set of
foreign policy challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few days ago, China seemed likely to go along with
whatever peace plan Russia and the United States brought to the
U.N. Security Council, where Beijing has a veto. Despite
accusations of Chinese espionage at American nuclear weapons labs
and Chinese efforts to influence the 1996 elections with improper
campaign contributions, relations with Beijing seemed stable after
last month's visit here by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Today the state of relations is best captured by the image of
Ambassador James Sasser staring glumly through the jagged remains
of a window in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing after three days of
violent anti-American demonstrations. The protests subsided
Tuesday, but the ferocity of the attack and the passive police
response showed that at least some of China's leaders endorsed the
crude response to the bombing. The refusal to accept Clinton's
repeated apologies, and the long delay in broadcasting his remarks
to the Chinese people, added to the impression that China was
spoiling for a diplomatic donnybrook. The purpose may be to deflect
the espionage charges or to draw attention within China away from
the 10th anniversary of the democracy movement that was crushed in
Tiananmen Square in June 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the embassy bombing was a terrible event. Clinton must
insure that the mistake is thoroughly investigated and that the
families of the Chinese victims receive American financial
assistance. Washington has previously surprised China with
unwelcome actions, particularly on the highly sensitive issue of
Taiwan. But the violent, stage-managed reaction to the Belgrade
bombing was unwarranted. It suggests that improved relations
between Washington and Beijing have rested on a dangerously
unstable foundation. Given other offensive Chinese behavior,
including the effort to steal nuclear secrets, Clinton should
proceed with caution, and a determination to protect American
interests, as he tries to repair relations.
</P>
<P>
   The first test is likely to come over Yugoslavia. China is now
delaying U.N. consideration of an international peacekeeping force
in Kosovo and demanding that NATO suspend bombing before the
Security Council acts. Clinton should continue to insist that
Serbian forces end their rampage through Kosovo and start returning
to Serbia before the bombing is stopped. The destruction at the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade is lamentable, but not a cause for
unwise concessions in Kosovo.

   WASHINGTON _ With $13 billion on the table, congressional
negotiators wheeled and dealed Tuesday over emergency bills to
finance battles in the Balkans, military projects for the Pentagon,
disaster victims in Central America, struggling farmers, big
corporations and favored constituents.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two members of the House and Senate Appropriations
Committees, meeting deep into the night around a square table in
the Senate's basement, wrangled over three different emergency
spending measures. The bills contain more than double the money
originally sought by the White House, which threatens to veto the
bill if it becomes laden with political provender unrelated to war
or disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The members battled over $1.1 billion in military money sought
by the House to refurbish overseas bases. ``This is going too
far,'' said the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   They fought over hundreds of millions of dollars in amendments
and riders sponsored by senators to benefit corporate interests and
home-state residents. ``We're not prepared to accept any of them,''
said the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Bill Young,
R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The beginnings of a deal emerged by nightfall: money for the
bases and the riders may die, and $1.8 billion for the first year
of military pay raise that the Congress and the administration plan
to enact may be removed from the bill, key members said, before the
bill is done. The appropriators may also add $500 million for
tornado and storm victims in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   This all began with bad weather and a war. In February,
President Clinton asked Congress for about $1 billion in disaster
relief for millions of people in Central America and the Caribbean
devastated by last year's hurricanes, which killed 9,000 people and
ruined the lives of thousands of others. In April, he sought $6
billion to pay for the continuing bombing of Yugoslavia and to
assists refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now three main ingredients are in the legislative stew.
</P>
<P>
   One is a $13 billion House bill, which added $7 billion in
Pentagon programs to the White House request for NATO's air war.
Another is a $1.3 billion House disaster relief bill to help the
hurricane victims, which includes White House requests to finance
loans for American farmers and shore up Jordan's role in the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The third is a Senate version of the disaster bill, which is $1
billion more expensive than the one passed by the House. That extra
money includes a fourth ingredient: pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   Examples from senators' wish lists include $2 million for a
feasibility study for wood veneer products in Alaska, home of
Stevens; $4 million for forestry research in Alabama, home of Sen.
Richard C. Shelby, a Republican member of the committee; $20
million for three jails for criminal aliens, one in West Virginia,
home of Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the committee's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   They also include royalty rebates and loan guarantees for
industries _ steel, oil, gas and mining interests in senators' home
states _ which add up to $330 million.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd, at 81 the acknowledged master of returning federal money
to his home state, joked about the projects he and his fellow
senators sought. ``That great philosopher, Mae West, once said:
``Too much of anything is simply wonderful.'''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are riders in the Senate bill that may cost no
money, but that the White House contends could exact a political or
social cost.
</P>
<P>
   One is a provision to block the White House from claiming a
share of the states' quarter-trillion dollar settlement with the
tobacco industry; President Clinton wants to use some of the money
for federal programs like discouraging children from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more narrowly focused, like proposals easing
commercial mining and fishing regulations. Shelby wants to keep the
Alabama sturgeon off the endangered species list, pleasing business
interests, enraging environmentalists and amusing some of his
fellow members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This species was declared extinct, and Senator Shelby
sponsored a study that found some,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula,
R-Ohio. ``Three. If there are only three, they probably are
endangered.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There remains the question of how to pay for it all.
</P>
<P>
   The likeliest source is surplus Social Security money. But both
political parties have pledged to keep their hands off that money.
So members in both Houses have proposed offsets, or cuts in other
programs, to help foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   These include cutting $827 million from anti-terrorism
activities, $521 million in food stamps, $289 million from
drug-control programs, and $150 million from projects to dispose of
50 tons of weapons-grade plutonium in Russia, enough for 15,000
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The White House budget director, Jacob J. Lew, said Clinton's
senior advisers will recommend a veto unless many of the riders and
cuts are removed or resolved. ``Our goal isn't to have a fight,''
Lew said in an interview. ``Our goal is to have a workable bill
that addresses our concerns.''

   Norton, a grayish cat with small, folded ears whose far-flung
adventures were described in two books, died on Saturday. He was
16, said the person with whom he lived, author Peter Gethers.
</P>
<P>
   He had kidney trouble and cancer, said Gethers, a former
executive at Random House who has also written novels and
screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a gift from an ex-girlfriend,'' Gethers said. ``I
didn't like cats at all. She brought him back from Los Angeles and
gave him to me. It was an instant relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon they were going everywhere together. One early trip was to
a weeklong writers' conference in San Diego, Calif. During one
workshop Leona Nevler, an editor at Ballantine Books, became
concerned that Gethers had left Norton (unattended and unleashed)
by the swimming pool at their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She couldn't get over why I wasn't worried,'' he said. ``I
went to the last place I had seen him and whistled, and he came out
of the bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   Later Gethers told her that Norton had flown on the Concorde,
had lived in a hotel with views of the Parisian skyline (as well as
open-window access to nearby rooftops) and had attended meetings
with director Roman Polanski &UR;  &LR; and actor Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `You should write a book called, `The Cat Who Went
to Paris.''' Gethers recalled Tuesday. ``I'm supposed to have my
finger on the pulse of American culture, but I totally blew it off.
I said, `Right.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Nevler called Gethers' agent and worked out a deal for
the book. That first volume, published in 1991, was followed by ``A
Cat Abroad'' (Crown, 1993).
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Gethers' traveling companion became so well known
that mail addressed to ``Norton, Sag Harbor, N.Y.'' was delivered _
naturally, Norton had a place in the Hamptons. He was recognized
throughout Europe. Once, on a walk through Amsterdam _ Gethers was
doing the walking; Norton was riding on his shoulders _ someone
stopped the pair and said, ``Excuse me, is that the cat who went to
Paris?''
</P>
<P>
   It was. And as Gethers' readers came to understand, Norton was a
cat with a distinct _ and distinctive _ personality. ``He was
independent without being standoffish,'' said Ms. Newberg.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gethers, Norton is survived by Gethers' friend, Janis
Donnaud.
</P>
<P>
   Albany Soul Food
</P>
<P>
   It has, by now, become something of a custom in Albany: Gov.
George E. Pataki's annual prayer breakfast. Pataki said he
scheduled the first Albany gathering after realizing that all 49
other governors had prayer breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people attended the one Tuesday. Darryl
Strawberry had been invited. (``He opted out after he had his
run-in with the police,'' said a spokesman for the governor.) But
one of his bosses from the Yankees _ Brian Cashman, the general
manager, spoke. So did The Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3rd, pastor of the
Abyssinian Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   As for music, Jennifer Grove, a 17-year-old actress from
Columbus, Ohio, sang ``Over the Rainbow'' from ``The Wizard of
Oz.'' She is appearing in the production at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play Dorothy, so obviously that's part of why I sang it,''
she said, but she added that the rainbow was a biblical symbol of
reassurance. ``I sang the verse before it, that says when the world
is a hopeless jumble and the raindrops tumble all around, heaven
opens a magic lane. It's a song of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   No Predictions
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that was Joe Torre in the trumpet section at Birdland, a
jazz club on West 44th Street near Eighth Avenue, on Monday night.
He was not riffing _ the band had not assembled yet, and he was
looking for an empty chair so he could sit down while autographing
baseballs with the Yankees' former general manager, Bob Watson.
They were raising money for prostate cancer research for the
American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, who had surgery for prostate cancer in March, would not
say when he would return to work. ``I'm not telling anybody,'' he
said, ``because last time, I said I would have a better idea by May
1. Then you had all the cameras and trucks up at the stadium that
day.''

ADVISORY GROUP STUDIES HMO-STYLE PACKAGES FOR MEDICARE RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The 52,000 area Medicare beneficiaries in
health maintenance organizations are likely to get cheaper and more
comprehensive vision, hearing and dental coverage next year.
</P>
<P>
   But they will probably pay a little more for doctor's office
visits or brand-name prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Those are among the benefit changes being considered today by a
federal advisory panel preparing Kansas City for an experiment. The
aim is to see whether the government can save money by making HMOs
bid for Medicare business.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City and Phoenix are the first metropolitan areas to take
part in this congressionally mandated pilot project. In both cities
the project has run into opposition from doctors and insurance
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City HMOs are scheduled to submit bids in early July for
Medicare contracts for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe competition can bring better and more efficient
health care, and I don't mean just cheap,'' said E.J. Holland Jr.,
assistant vice president for corporate benefits of Sprint Corp. and
chairman of the advisory committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it makes eminent good sense to pilot it in some
communities before Congress adopts it'' nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Participation in Medicare HMOs is voluntary. About 23 percent of
the 230,000 Medicare beneficiaries in 11 area counties are HMO
members. Seven companies provide a total of 13 different benefit
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Those enrolled in traditional fee-for-service Medicare generally
receive fewer benefits than those in HMOs, but they have greater
choices of doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   HMO members typically must use only those providers listed in
their plans, but they receive added benefits, such as low-cost
prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   In most places Medicare gives HMOs a set amount of money to
provide care for each member. HMOs set the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the model being tried here, HMOs will bid on what they
will charge Medicare for a standard benefits package. The advisory
panel, made up largely of health-care and business executives and
Medicare beneficiaries, considers the benefits package today at the
Kansas City Airport Hilton, 8801 N.W. 112th St. The meeting, which
runs from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits package for next year would be available without a
premium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were taking the benefits that existed (in HMO plans) and
selected among them for benefits that were desirable but wouldn't
break the bank,'' Holland said.  &LR; brk:Benefits comparison
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star compared the proposed benefits to benefits
offered this year by HMO plans that do not charge premiums. Among
the differences:
</P>
<P>
   - Office visits to primary care physicians will be $12; visits
to specialists $17. Most plans now charge $10 per physician visit.
Physical exams, which plans provide free or for a $10 fee, will
cost $12.
</P>
<P>
   - Visits to physical and occupational therapists will cost $12;
most plans now charge $10.
</P>
<P>
   - Ambulance rides will cost $25. Most plans now charge $25 or
more, although certain Cigna HealthCare and HealthNet plans provide
free rides. Emergency room visits will cost $50, the same as most
plans now charge.
</P>
<P>
   - Urgent care, at $25 per visit, will be cheaper than what most
plans charge now for unscheduled doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   - Beneficiaries will receive one free vision exam a year and a
pair of glasses for $20. Most plans now do not cover glasses.
</P>
<P>
   - A free annual hearing test and a $500 hearing-aid allowance
every three years are provided. Most plans now charge for or do not
offer hearing tests and have small or no hearing-aid allowances.
</P>
<P>
   - Beneficiaries will get up to two dental exams a year for $17
each. Most plans now do not include dental benefits.
</P>
<P>
   - Prescription drug coverage, not offered by traditional
Medicare, is one of the most popular features of Medicare HMOs. But
sharply rising drug costs have made it difficult for HMOs to
maintain this benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed benefits package provides generic drugs for a $10
co-pay, the same as most HMOs now charge. Brand-name drugs will
cost $20; most HMOs now charge $10.
</P>
<P>
   All the HMOs set an annual limit on drug benefits ranging from
$500 to $1,000. The proposed plan sets a cap of $800.
</P>
<P>
   Holland said the committee probably would approve the benefits
package with few or no alterations. A slight improvement in
prescription drug benefits is the only change likely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised to see the benefit raised a little,
but it won't be unlimited. There will be a cap,'' Holland said.
 &LR; brk:Seeking a delay
</P>
<P>
   Competitive bidding has met with stiff opposition from some
doctors and health insurance plans. The Health Care Financing
Administration, the federal agency that manages Medicare, tried it
in Denver and Baltimore but was stopped by intense insurance
industry opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with strong health-plan lobbying, the Phoenix advisory
panel asked Health Care Financing in March to postpone competitive
bidding there for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some HMOs and physicians also want a delay in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to rush it through,'' said Mary Jacobi,
spokeswoman for the Missouri Association of Health Plans. ``We have
to do this right and if right takes a little longer, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. Van Way III, a physician and member of the advisory
committee, said he would ask the committee today to seek a delay in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're squeezing a process that should take a year-and-a-half
into six or eight months. We just can't do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holland dismissed the concerns as a self-interested attempt to
stop competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
   Holland said he would ask Health Care Financing for a
postponement if the agency granted Phoenix an extension. But he was
confident the committee could stay on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, we're very close to being finished with what we have
to do, very close,'' he said. ``Instead of spending our time
whining, we spent our time trying to make it work.''

GOVERNOR PROPOSES TO BROADEN STATE'S DEATH PENALTY LAW
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday proposed broadening
the state's death penalty law, including a change that would allow
death sentences for defendants who have pleaded guilty to a murder
charge, and not just those found guilty at trial.
</P>
<P>
   The idea comes in response to a ruling in December by the Court
of Appeals, New York's highest court, that struck down the
plea-bargaining provisions of the death penalty law that was
enacted in 1995. Under that law, a person can be sentenced to die
only at trial, not after a guilty plea. The court ruled in December
that the distinction unfairly penalized defendants for exercising
their right to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The 1995 law created a crime of first-degree murder, punishable
by either death or life in prison without possibility of parole,
penalties that did not exist in New York at the time. Prosecutors
complained that the court's decision made it impossible to
plea-bargain first-degree murder cases to obtain life sentences,
leaving them with the choice of going to trial or trying to obtain
guilty pleas to second-degree murder, which carries a maximum
penalty of 25 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a Republican, proposed allowing a first-degree murder
defendant to enter an ``open plea'' _ a guilty plea without there
being a plea deal with prosecutors _ but only if the prosecutors
and judge agreed. A jury would then decide the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's plan would also resolve another problem in the
current law, one that has not yet arisen in any case. If a jury,
after convicting someone of first-degree murder, deadlocks between
death and life in prison, the judge cannot impose any greater
penalty than 25 years to life. Pataki would give the judge the same
choice of penalties the jury had.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's proposal includes several other provisions that
would add certain crimes to the list of possible capital offenses
and give prosecutors new advantages in capital cases. Most of those
changes he proposed last year, in a bill that was passed by the
Republican-controlled Senate, but was not acted on by the
Democrat-controlled Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, does not yet have a
position on the governor's plan, said his spokeswoman, Patricia
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   The list of possible first-degree murder offenses now includes
torture killing, killing a police officer and mass murder. Pataki
would add ``thrill kills,'' gang initiation murders, killings to
gain inheritance or collect on insurance, and some accessories to
murder who neither committed nor ordered the killing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor would also let prosecutors give the final summation
in capital trials, rather than defense lawyers, and he would allow
testimony in the penalty phase about the effect of a slaying on the
victim's family and community.  &QL;

TOBACCO EXECUTIVE TESTIFIES AT TRIAL OF MISSOURI LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A top U.S. tobacco executive acknowledged in
testimony Tuesday that cigarette smoking can be harmful, but he
defended the way his company has addressed health issues over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly believe smoking has been shown to be a risky
behavior,'' said Nicholas Brookes, chairman of the Brown &AMP;
Williamson Tobacco Corp. ``...The statistics are sufficient for us
to conclude that smoking causes these diseases.''
</P>
<P>
   Brookes' company has been sued in federal court by the family of
Charles Steele, who died of lung cancer in 1995 while living in
Vandalia, Mo. They contend Brown &AMP; Williamson was responsible for
maintaining Steele's addiction to nicotine by selling him an
unreasonably dangerous product. They are asking for more than $25
million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Kansas City,
Brookes pointed to more than $300 million in health research Brown
&AMP; Williamson has helped to fund with independent scientists since
the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson also markets a range of products for smokers
looking to reduce their exposure to cancer-causing substances,
including the lowest tar and nicotine cigarette in the United
States, Carlton Ultra.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a clear responsibility to make cigarettes as safe as
we can with the highest possible materials and to the highest
possible standards,'' Brookes said. ``We have a responsibility to
understand our product.''
</P>
<P>
   But even though Brookes acknowledged that smoking carries health
risks, including lung cancer, he would not say how many Americans
die prematurely each year because of cigarette smoking.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed by lawyer J. Michael Cronan, who represents
Steele's family, Brookes said he didn't agree with health
authorities who estimate about 430,000 people a year die from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite impossible to make those calculations,'' Brookes
said. ``I don't challenge health authorities' right to put that
figure out.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Cronan sought to refute testimony from two company
witnesses, who said that identifying the cause of Steele's lung
cancer was impossible, in part because of his exposure to
industrial chemicals at work.
</P>
<P>
   Oncologist Ace Allen testified for the Steele family. Allen
showed jurors a chart that calculated Steele's lung cancer risk
from smoking at up to 10 times higher than his risks from chemicals
he may have encountered at work at an aluminum foundry and a brick
manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers defending Brown &AMP; Williamson rested their case Tuesday
afternoon. The jury will return this morning for instructions from
the judge and closing arguments. &QL;

STUDY: SOME ADDITIVES IN REFORMULATED GASOLINE HELP LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Reformulated gasoline _ the key to efforts to
reduce automotive air pollution in the area _ has hit another speed
bump on its road to Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   A federal study released Tuesday reported that some of the
additives used in the new fuel did not do much to reduce urban
smog.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not question the overall effectiveness of
reformulated gasoline in reducing ozone, a component of urban smog.
The study focused on additives that add oxygen to the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Reformulated gasoline has many components other than oxygen
additives that help reduce ozone. Oxygen additives, however, have
been linked to other environmental concerns, such as groundwater
contamination from leaking gasoline storage tanks.
</P>
<P>
   What these latest findings will mean for Kansas City remains
unclear. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has announced it
will not approve the area's long-range transportation plans _ which
call for reformulated gasoline as the linchpin of ozone-reduction
efforts _ until the governors of Missouri and Kansas formally
request the gasoline for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Both states have so far declined to formally request the fuel.
Instead, they will wait until a ``fuel summit'' early next month in
Kansas City, Kan., when such issues as the additives can be
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Many local highway construction projects, which require federal
approval, could be endangered by the delay.
</P>
<P>
   The oxygen-adding chemicals, ethanol and methyl tertiary-butyl
ether, or MTBE, ``have little impact on lowering ozone levels,''
said William Chameides, chairman of the National Research Council
committee that conducted the study.
</P>
<P>
   But the study did not find reformulated gasoline ineffective in
general. ``We found reformulated gasoline has some significant
impacts on emissions (of chemicals that form ozone),'' said
Chameides, who is a professor of atmospheric sciences at the
Georgia Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when we look at what the oxygenates (ethanol and MTBE) are
doing, it's not clear they're doing anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings may add to the growing concern about the
additives.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, for example, has contaminated drinking water supplies in
other states when it has leaked from gasoline storage tanks, pipes
and motors. In California, state officials have decided recently to
phase out its use in reformulated fuels sold there.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, federal law requires a certain percentage of oxygen
in reformulated gasoline. The additives _ ethanol and MTBE _ have
been used for years in fuels but at lower levels than are required
in reformulated gas.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis-area stations will begin selling the new fuel in June.
State officials said the fuel would include ethanol and MTBE
blends.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Hiney, environmental manager for the Mid-America Regional
Council, said the new study might further complicate the complex
situation of reformulated gas. But Kansas City should benefit in
the long run, she added.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the metro area brings the fuel here, many of the
questions about the additives may be settled, she said.
</P>
<P>
   To the American Petroleum Institute, the study verified what it
has been saying for years: There's little pollution benefit to
oxygen-adding chemicals in the fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no compelling environmental benefit to them,'' said
Bill O'Keefe, the petroleum institute's executive vice president
and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Don Zinger, assistant director of the Environmental Protection
Agency's Office of Mobile Sources, in Washington, said the
additives reduced the level of more-toxic chemicals, including
benzene, which resulted in fewer toxic emissions from tailpipes.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, a special Environmental Protection Agency panel is
expected to recommend in late June whether MTBE should continue to
be used in reformulated fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council is the operating arm of the
National Academy of Science and the National Academy of
Engineering. It is a private, nonprofit institution that provides
scientific advice. The Environmental Protection Agency paid for the
study. &QL;

VAUGHN MAKES YANKS PAY FOR ERRORS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Anaheim's master plan was to place Mo Vaughn into the
middle of its lineup, surround him with All-Star caliber players
and create an offense that would surely result in more runs than
New York taxis. But Vaughn's supporting cast has been decimated by
injuries, and as he was in Boston, Vaughn is left to carry his
team.
</P>
<P>
   He can certainly do that, as the Yankees know too well. Vaughn
blasted a pivotal three-run homer _ his 13th at Yankee Stadium _
and the Yankees pitched and fielded horribly in a 9-7 loss to the
Angels on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza, told earlier in the day he was being switched
from the rotation to the bullpen, was knocked around for three runs
in three innings and suffered the defeat. Shane Spencer, called up
from Class AAA Columbus to be the Yankees' fulltime left fielder,
pounded a single and a home run.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees (20-11) began to rally
against reliever Troy Percival, but Paul O'Neill took a called
third strike and then began screaming at the home-plate umpire,
Greg Kosc. O'Neill returned to the dugout, but then tossed a water
cooler onto the field. Kosc ejected O'Neill, who approached the
umpire, angrily gesturing, while being held by teammate Bernie
Williams and the first-base coach, Jose Cardenal.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim (14-19), already without outfielder Jim Edmonds
(surgery), shortstop Gary DiSarcina (broken arm) and second baseman
Randy Velarde (stiff lower back), placed right fielder Tim Salmon
on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained wrist before Tuesday
night's game. Angels Manager Terry Collins started a lineup that
included Dave Silvestri, a journeyman with a .207 career average,
as his No. 2 hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels do have Vaughn, the slugger they signed as a free
agent in the off-season, one of many Angel batters who capitalized
on the ineffectiveness of Andy Pettitte, the Yankees' starter.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte's fastball has been clocked about 86-88 mph so far this
season, slower than last year, and whether it's because of his
diminished fastball or not, Pettitte pitched Monday night as if he
does not trust his stuff. Over a span of 11 batters, from Vaughn in
the third inning through Todd Greene to close the fourth, Pettitte
threw 65 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Pettitte would have been the losing pitcher on most nights, but
he happened to be throwing in one of those games that vendors dream
of and Little League parents hate, when all pitchers seem
physically incapable of throwing strikes.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the little movement wasn't exactly picturesque.
Steve Sparks, Anaheim's knuckleballer, carried a 3-1 lead into the
third inning and walked two batters and hit another, and two of the
Yankees' first three runs in the inning stemmed from passed balls
by Greene. The Yankees took a 4-3 lead and added another run when
Tim Unroe, the Angels' right fielder, misplayed Chili Davis' line
drive.

<P>
   Pettitte immediately gave back the runs, walking Orlando
Palmeiro and surrendering a single to Andy Sheets _ the No. 8 and
No. 9 batters _ and with two outs and first base open, Pettitte
kept spinning breaking balls to Vaughn until he made a mistake and
Vaughn blasted a three-run home run. The Angels had six runs, the
Yankees five runs, and the vendors had a killing.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Paul O'Neill tagged up on Davis' fly ball and
raced home with the tying run. When Spencer stepped in front of the
weak-armed Bernie Williams to take a fly ball and throw out Sheets
at home plate to save a run in the top of the sixth, the momentum
appeared to belong to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long.

<P>
   Mendoza, who had been saved by Spencer's play in the sixth,
allowed a solo home run to Garret Anderson with one out in the
seventh. Troy Glaus followed by smashing a one-hopper off Scott
Brosius, the Yankees' third baseman, for a single. Glaus took
second on a groundout, but Mendoza appeared to be out of the inning
when Unroe grounded to first and Mendoza raced over to cover the
bag and Martinez flipped him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza missed it. Another error, the Yankees' second of the
game and 29th of the season.
