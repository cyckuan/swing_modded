<HEADLINE>  Actor DeForest Kelley Dead at 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- DeForest Kelley, whose portrayal of the  
cantankerous and compassionate Dr. McCoy on the original ``Star 
Trek'' series highlighted an acting career dating to the 1950s, has 
died after a lengthy illness. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley died shortly after noon Friday, said Carol Pfannkuche, a  
spokeswoman for the Motion Picture and Television Country Home and 
Hospital, a retirement facility in suburban Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy was one of the colorful crew of  
23rd-century space travelers that helped make the ``Star Trek'' 
television series a lasting cult favorite. The program aired from 
1966-69 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The verbal sparring and the love-hate relationship between McCoy  
and the coldly logical Mr. Spock provided grist for many of the 
lighthearted moments in the series, its spinoffs and several 
ensuing films. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a country doctor!'' McCoy would exclaim when called  
on to cope with the other-worldly illnesses and calamities that 
beset the USS Enterprise, but he would always come through for his 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bones hardly went an episode without arguing or complaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine -- not to have  
my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget,'' he 
growled in one episode. His exclamations included ``I'm a doctor, 
not a mechanic'' and ``I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``DeForest Kelley was a Southern gentleman all of his life -- a  
kind, good, wonderful friend,'' said William Shatner, who played 
Capt. James Kirk. ``I will miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock: ``He represented  
humanity and it fitted him well. He was a decent, loving, caring 
partner and will be deeply missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jackson DeForest Kelley on Jan. 20, 1920, in Atlanta, he  
played supporting roles in a number of movies, including ``The Man 
in the Gray Flannel Suit'' (1956); ``Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' 
and ``Raintree County'' (1957) and ``Apache Uprising'' (1966). 
</P>
<P>
	He also made appearances on dozens of television shows,  
including ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Bonanza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Trek,'' which was created by Gene Roddenberry, brought  
Kelley out of relative obscurity and into the limelight of popular 
culture. He played the role in six of the ``Star Trek'' films. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley didn't object to being typecast as McCoy.  
</P>
<P>
	``He loved it. He loved that series so much,'' said A.C. Lyles,  
a friend and longtime Paramount Studios producer who knew Kelley 
for five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyles recalled how Kelley went up for a leading role in ``This  
Gun for Hire'' in 1940, losing out to Alan Ladd but gaining a 
Paramount contract and regular roles in Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always used him as a heavy, a mean man, and he was marvelous  
at that,'' Lyles said. In real life, Kelley was known for his great 
sense of humor and a skill at growing roses. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy helped to round out the core characters of the original  
cast -- the macho Kirk, the ever-placid Spock and the spirited 
engineer Scotty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the character he played, he was a very sweet, shy and  
gentle man,'' said George Takei, 62, who played Sulu in the series 
and movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is survived by his wife of nearly 55 years, Carolyn. She  
was hospitalized at the Motion Picture facility with a broken leg 
and had been in the room next to her husband, Lyles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral plans were pending.

<HEADLINE> Randa's Hit Streak Ends at 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Joe Randa's streak of consecutive hits for the  
Kansas City Royals ended at 10 Saturday night, two short of the 
major league record. 
</P>
<P>
	Randa singled in the second inning off Pittsburgh's Jose Silva  
for his team-record 10th hit in 10 at-bats. He then struck out in 
the third, ending his streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Randa fell short of the major league record of 12, shared by  
Pinky Higgins of the 1938 Boston Red Sox and Walt Dropo of the 1952 
Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Royals' record of eight had been held by several players and  
accomplished most recently by Hall of Famer George Brett in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Randa's streak started when he had a two-run single in the  
eighth inning Tuesday against the St. Louis Cardinals. On 
Wednesday, he went 5-for-5 against the Cardinals and then set the 
Royals record by going 3-for-3 with his first two-home run game 
against the Pirates on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored eight runs and drove in eight during the streak.

<HEADLINE>  Paris Air Show Opens With Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- The world's largest air show opened on  
an ominous note Saturday when a prototype of Russia's most advanced 
fighter jet crashed during a flight demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue and white Sukhoi-30 MK had just finished fluttering  
like a leaf in a controlled descent when it appeared to lose power 
coming out of a dive at the 43rd Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Two muffled blasts were heard as the plane went down, and black  
smoke billowed from the crash site on the airfield, far from 
spectators. The two pilots ejected from the jet and were not 
seriously injured, the air show's organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the moment we don't know if it's a mechanical incident or  
if he flew too low,'' said Patrick Guerin, an air show spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin engine jet crashed hours after French President Jacques  
Chirac inaugurated the eight-day event on a day reserved for the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,800 aerospace companies from 40 countries are  
participating in the show, which is held every other year at Le 
Bourget Airport north of Paris. Producers of military aircraft, 
cruise missiles and other state-of-the-art weaponry are exhibiting 
their goods alongside makers of civilian airliners and business 
jets. 
</P>
<P>
	All are vying to sell in a market made increasingly competitive  
by cutbacks in defense spending by cash-strapped governments and a 
weakening demand for passenger planes. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a concerted sales pitch, F-16 and Eurofighter jets  
looped and corkscrewed through the overcast skies above the 
airfield. Spectators felt their chests shake when pilots gunned the 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin's C-130J, a ponderous four-engine military  
transport, arced steeply over the tarmac before landing to let the 
Sukhoi take its turn in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's leisurely mood suddenly grew anxious three minutes  
later when the Russian jet crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he tried to recover, he couldn't,'' said Edmond  
Marchegay, the show's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The last plane to crash at the air show was also Russian -- a  
MiG-29 that went down in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, when you crash in such a way, you are not helping  
your sales and marketing campaign,'' said Oreste Fabbro, a 
marketing manager for the Eurofighter, which is built by a 
consortium of German, Spanish, British and Italian firms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bengt Adamsson, a sales executive with Saab AB of  
Sweden, a maker of the delta-wing Gripen fighter, said that 
accidents during test flights are not unusual. The crash of the 
Sukhoi probably would not hurt its sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perspective customers have an awareness of these kinds of  
things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The air show is expected to generate millions of dollars in  
sales, and orders have already started rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolls-Royce said Saturday it had received an order worth up to  
$88 million to supply the engines for Brazil-made Embraer RG-145 
jets ordered by an Italian airline, Al Italia Express.

Cobb $10.7 million for a 1993 Sports Illustrated article,

<HEADLINE> Arrest in Orange County Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Calif. (AP) -- A sheriff's deputy was shot  
repeatedly with an assault rifle outside a convenience store early 
Saturday, and authorities arrested a man for the crime a few hours 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Brad Riches' patrol car was riddled with bullets from an  
AK-47 in the predawn attack, said Lt. Steve Fauchier. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurice Gerald Steskal, 39, was arrested and booked for  
investigation of murder. He was held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Steskal was toting the assault rifle under his arm when he  
bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store before walking 
out and allegedly shooting Riches about 1 a.m., Fauchier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riches, 34, had pulled into the store's parking lot and noticed  
an armed man but was unable to draw his weapon, though he was able 
to send a radio code that an emergency broadcast was about to 
follow, Orange County Sheriff Mike Carona said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a homicide that is as brutal as you can possibly  
imagine,'' Carona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steskal had previous arrests for drunken driving, drug  
possession and assaulting an officer, but authorities were unable 
to say whether he was convicted of any crimes, Fauchier said.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks Coach Reaps Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy made millions when the New York  
Knicks made it to the NBA Finals on Friday night with a 90-82 
victory over the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	An option year in Van Gundy's contract worth $3.5 million became  
guaranteed when he led his team out of the Eastern Conference 
finals. He also will reportedly receive a $500,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care what's in there, I just want to win,'' Van  
Gundy said Friday after the Knicks held their shootaround in 
preparation for Game 6 against the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's potential windfall headlined the front page of one  
of the city's tabloids Friday along with a rare photo of Van Gundy 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	The dour-faced coach, in his fourth season running the team, is  
currently making $2 million per season -- the same amount Doc Rivers 
will be getting from Orlando next season despite never having 
coached at any level. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he wasn't exactly sure what's in his contract  
because he keeps it in a safety deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about this job is, I'm fine (financially).  
Wanting to win has zero to do with money,'' Van Gundy said. ``You 
can't buy your way into something that's worthwhile, and the only 
thing worthwhile out of here is trying to be the best team for one 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his team's postseason success, Van Gundy has not  
received a vote of confidence from Madison Square Garden 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden president Dave Checketts, who demoted general manager  
Ernie Grunfeld in April because of a rift between the GM and coach, 
has steadfastly insisted that all team personnel, including the 
coach, will have their performances reviewed at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts met with former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson in  
April when the Knicks were 21-21 and in jeopardy of missing the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts subsequently lied to Van Gundy by denying such a  
meeting ever took place, then met with the coach during the 
second-round series against Atlanta and apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation about whether Van Gundy would even want to return to  
the Knicks has been rampant ever since. For the past two weeks, Van 
Gundy has brushed aside all queries about his job status. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy became a risk-taker in the Eastern Conference finals.  
He tinkered with his starting lineup before Game 4 by inserting 
Latrell Sprewell and removing Kurt Thomas. And in Game 5, he 
curiously kept Marcus Camby on the bench for the first 10 minutes 
of the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``By starting Latrell, it was neither genius ... nor stupidity  
in Game 4,'' Van Gundy said. ``It was what I felt was in the best 
interest of the team. That's how I make every decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy took a lot of criticism when the Sprewell move seemed  
to backfire in Game 4. But those same critics were lauding the move 
after Game 5 when Sprewell unleashed an array of offensive moves 
and had his best game of the series with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
	With Camby, the coach decided to keep him out for the bulk of  
the third quarter because he had three fouls. He wanted Camby 
available for the entire fourth quarter, and he didn't want him 
playing tentatively because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	The move paid off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just really thankful that I'm a part of a team that's  
still playing,'' Van Gundy said. ``And what small part I play in 
it, I take very seriously. I do the job the best I can. '' 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, it meant departing from what got the Knicks here  
and taking a gamble or two to try to help offset the loss of center 
Patrick Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you become paralyzed by the thought that you may be  
criticized for doing something, you're never going to be the risk 
taker you need to be as a good coach. Risk taking is part of it. If 
it doesn't work out, you've got to accept the responsibility for it 
not working out,'' Van Gundy said.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks Coach Reaps Millions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Van Gundy made millions when the New York  
Knicks made it to the NBA Finals on Friday night with a 90-82 
victory over the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	An option year in Van Gundy's contract worth $3.5 million became  
guaranteed when he led his team out of the Eastern Conference 
finals. He also will reportedly receive a $500,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care what's in there, I just want to win,'' Van  
Gundy said Friday after the Knicks held their shootaround in 
preparation for Game 6 against the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy's potential windfall headlined the front page of one  
of the city's tabloids Friday along with a rare photo of Van Gundy 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	The dour-faced coach, in his fourth season running the team, is  
currently making $2 million per season -- the same amount Doc Rivers 
will be getting from Orlando next season despite never having 
coached at any level. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Gundy said he wasn't exactly sure what's in his contract  
because he keeps it in a safety deposit box. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one thing about this job is, I'm fine (financially).  
Wanting to win has zero to do with money,'' Van Gundy said. ``You 
can't buy your way into something that's worthwhile, and the only 
thing worthwhile out of here is trying to be the best team for one 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his team's postseason success, Van Gundy has not  
received a vote of confidence from Madison Square Garden 
management. 
</P>
<P>
	Garden president Dave Checketts, who demoted general manager  
Ernie Grunfeld in April because of a rift between the GM and coach, 
has steadfastly insisted that all team personnel, including the 
coach, will have their performances reviewed at the end of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Checketts met with former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson in  
April when the Knicks were 21-21 and in jeopardy of missing the 
playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested on Child Porn Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) -- A man who recently admitted to stealing  
computers, apparently to download child pornography, was arrested 
at a public library for allegedly downloading pictures of naked 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Roberts, 20, faces a charge of pornography involving  
juveniles. He also will have to serve the five-year prison term 
suspended when he pleaded guilty eight days earlier to obscenity 
and to stealing $24,000 worth of university computers, said 
Attorney Daniel Landry, a local prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, librarians spotted Roberts looking at child  
pornography Web sites and called police to the Lafayette Public 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found Roberts trying to destroy images saved on a  
computer disk, but he was unsuccessful, said police Cpl. Mark 
Francis. Police confiscated disks containing lewd photos of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts had admitted stealing computer equipment from the  
University of Southwestern Louisiana. Investigators found evidence 
of child porn site visitations on those machines.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson Buys 'Wind' Oscar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Jackson got an Oscar for best motion  
picture today. The film was ``Gone With the Wind,'' and he had to 
pay $1.5 million for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainer phoned in his bid to Sotheby's to purchase the  
statuette awarded to David O. Selznick for the 1939 movie, 
Sotheby's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the auction, the Oscar had been estimated at a value of  
up to only about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sold on Sotheby's auction block Saturday was the film's  
final shooting script, containing the then-controversial line 
spoken by Clark Gable -- ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn'' -- 
Rhett Butler's famous last words to petulant wife Scarlett O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog-eared script, with last-minute changes scribbled on pink  
and cream pages, was sold to an unidentified New York collector for 
$46,000, against a pre-sale estimate of $40,000 to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the orchid percale dress that took Vivien  
Leigh through much of the Civil War movie. She went from clean and 
neat before fleeing the burning Atlanta to dirty and tattered as 
she struggled to support her family at their once-grand estate, 
Tara. 
</P>
<P>
	The dress, one of 27 identical dresses made for the wear and  
tear of filming the movie, went for $90,500 to a Brazilian woman 
who wouldn't give her name to reporters. The costume had a pre-sale 
estimate of $10,000 to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's auction also included memorabilia from the Coney  
Island amusement park, including a 1930s ``kicking mule'' game, 
whose object was to hit a donkey's behind. It drew $2,875. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fascinated by the peculiar brand of carnie and folk  
art,'' said seller Lenny Goodstein, who had traveled with a circus 
in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
	His collection of trophies from the Brooklyn amusement haven  
once known as ``Sodom by the Sea'' included the ``Extraordinary 
bubble blowing clown.'' The huge clown face, fitted with a 
bubble-blowing apparatus, fetched $10,350.

<HEADLINE> Masked Gunmen Rob Babe Ruth Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The house of Ruth was robbed again Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	For the third time in two weeks, two masked gunmen held up  
employees at the Babe Ruth Museum and Birthplace, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The robbers, one of whom wielded a silver-plated handgun, made  
off with an undetermined amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators believe the same pair committed all three  
robberies, police spokesman Sgt. Scott Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they'll keep doing this until they get caught,'' Rowe  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Yankees slugger was born in 1895 in Baltimore. His  
birthplace is a few blocks from the Baltimore Orioles' current 
stadium at Camden Yards.

<P>
	MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Kenneth S. Davis, an author and historian  
who had recently completed work on a fifth volume of his biography 
of Franklin D. Roosevelt, died Thursday. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	The first volume of his biography of Roosevelt, ``FDR: The  
Beckoning of Destiny,'' was published in 1974 and won the Francis 
Parkman Prize, considered one of the top awards in the field of 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Later volumes chronicled the Roosevelt years from 1928-40, and  
he had just completed a fifth volume, ``The War Years,'' that has 
not been released. 
</P>
<P>
	He also wrote biographies of Adlai Stevenson, Dwight Eisenhower  
and Charles Lindbergh.

	FAIRFAX, Calif. (AP) -- Rick Fields, a writer who chronicled the  
rise of Buddhism in the United States, died Sunday of cancer. He 
was 57. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields wrote ``How the Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative  
History of Buddhism in America'' in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	He began writing at the Whole Earth Catalog in 1969, and later

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- DeForest Kelley, whose portrayal of the  
cantankerous and compassionate Dr. McCoy on the original ``Star 
Trek'' series highlighted an acting career dating to the 1950s, 
died Friday after a lengthy illness. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict between McCoy's all-too-human character and Spock's  
cold logic provided grist for many of the series' lighthearted 
moments. ``I'm just a country doctor!'' McCoy would say when called 
on to cope with other-worldly illnesses and calamities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley reprised his Dr. McCoy role in six ``Star Trek'' films.  
</P>
<P>
	His earlier screen credits include ``Gunfight at the O.K.  
Corral'' and ``Raintree County.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to ``Star Trek,'' he made appearances on dozens of  
television shows, including ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Bonanza.''

water conservation pamphlets and Florida Turnpike toll booths, died 
Monday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1963, Nunn joined the flood control district, now known as  
the South Florida Water Management District, and worked there for 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He created the alligator logo for the district and produced a  
film about the life of an alligator in the wild. He named the 
cartoon logo after Freddy, a real life baby gator who hatched in 
his film. 
</P>
<P>
	Nunn eventually gave the real gator to the Palm Beach Zoo and  
would visit him on lunch breaks. Freddy was killed by vandals in 
1985.

	Porter was an influential member of the Standing Liturgical

<HEADLINE> Mets' Valentine Has Weird Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Bobby Valentine sat behind his desk Saturday  
morning, the New York Mets manager was asked if he was a lightning 
rod for turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole life. This week was nothing new,'' he said. ``It's  
just a little more fun when I get down for people to kick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a 10-day period, there was an eight-game losing streak  
followed by a four-game winning streak. He found out two of his 
outfielders were put on waivers. Then he was told general manager 
Steve Phillips was firing three of his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	There was an argument with a reporter and a screaming match with  
Bobby Bonilla, who refused to pinch hit Tuesday night. To top it 
off, Valentine was caught in the Mets' dugout wearing a disguise 
Wednesday night after umpires had ejected him. 
</P>
<P>
	In retrospect, he said he never should have donned the fake  
mustache and sunglasses and returned to the dugout, earning a 
two-game suspension from the National League. 
</P>
<P>
	But everything he does garners attention.  
</P>
<P>
	Major league managers are in the spotlight, and it's rarely more  
glaring than in New York, where the slightest misstep turns them 
into tennis balls for the tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
	Particularly Valentine.  
</P>
<P>
	Sparky Anderson once called him ``wonderfully arrogant.''  
</P>
<P>
	``When I was playing against him, you had a sense of the  
confident, cocky air he had about him,'' former Texas GM Tom Grieve 
said while Valentine was his manager. ``But when you get to know 
him, you find out what a big heart he's got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine can be brusque. He can be outspoken at times. And he  
certainly isn't shy about taking credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think things are as fragile as people would like it to  
be,'' he said Saturday. ``It's a strong foundation, and it's built 
on those players in the clubhouse. We might have had a couple of 
windows broken, but the structure's still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't just talking about events of the past week.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm referring to the abyss that was here 2 1/2 years ago,'' he  
said, thinking back to when he replaced Dallas Green on Aug. 26, 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine, 49, has spent his entire life in baseball -- he even  
married the daughter of Ralph Branca, who gave up the home run to 
Bobby Thomson that gave the New York Giants the 1951 NL pennant 
over the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing in the majors from 1969-79 -- he was .260 career  
hitter -- Valentine managed the Texas Rangers from May 1985 until 
July 1992, setting a major league record for most games managing 
one team without finishing first (1,186). 
</P>
<P>
	He managed in Japan, then returned to the Mets' Norfolk farm  
club in 1996 and took over the major league team after it went 
59-72 under Green. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mets have been completely transformed, but have fallen short  
of the playoffs, finishing 88-74 in each of his two full seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	When Phillips fired the coaches last Saturday night, the Mets  
were 27-28, dropping under .500 for the first time since they lost 
the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
	New York responded with a four-game winning streak. Even when  
the Mets were losing, Valentine said the team was playing well. On 
Saturday, he termed it ``10 days of outstanding baseball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clubhouse, he said, was now ``placid and peaceful,'' a sign  
that he and Bonilla may have reached a truce. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took a terribly disruptive situation and calmed it,  
straightened it and made it whole,'' Valentine said. ``Today, as 
opposed to a couple of days ago, things are a lot calmer.''

<HEADLINE> A Look at Knicks' Improbable Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget the fact that nobody thought it was  
possible for the Knicks to make it to the finals. Not too long ago, 
nobody in New York even thought they were any good. 
</P>
<P>
	There was good reason for all the naysayers to be ganging up on  
the Knicks just a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The franchise center kept missing the final shot, the coach was  
too stubborn to give adequate playing time to the newest members of 
the team, the general manager was too insecure about his own risky 
moves to let the coach do what he thought was best for the team. 
</P>
<P>
	In short, the Knicks were a basket case and New York hated them.  
</P>
<P>
	Boos and insults rained down from the fans. The sports talks  
shows were filled with statements like: ``Trade Sprewell.'' ``Trade 
Houston.'' ``Cut Ewing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one believed in the Knicks.  
</P>
<P>
	Well, almost no one.  
</P>
<P>
	``You guys buried us, covered us, started shoveling dirt on  
us,'' Patrick Ewing said. ``We still believed in ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A look at some of the key moments in this season of turmoil that  
has somehow continued into mid-June with the Knicks having a shot 
at the franchise's first title since 1973: 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 23 -- Latrell Sprewell sits on a podium alongside coach Jeff  
Van Gundy after the Knicks acquire him in a trade with Golden 
State. ``I'm out to start all over and show people the real me,'' 
Sprewell said. ``I'm not the person I've been portrayed to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 25 -- Van Gundy reports that Marcus Camby, who had been  
acquired for the popular Charles Oakley, has started training camp 
out of shape. It would be one of many instances when Van Gundy 
publicly knocked Camby. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan. 27 -- Sprewell scores 27 points in his first exhibition  
game, including 21 in a 12-minute burst. The crowd loves him. 
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 7 -- Knicks drop to 0-2 with a home loss to Miami. Sprewell  
injures his foot, keeping him out of the next 13 games. Camby asks 
out after five minutes, telling Van Gundy he is winded. 
</P>
<P>
	Feb. 25 -- Knicks beat Minnesota 115-113 in overtime, improving  
to 8-3. They look like a well-oiled machine without Sprewell's 
freelancing. 
</P>
<P>
	March 9 -- Ewing limps off in the first minute with Achilles'  
tendinitis. Knicks lose to Milwaukee at the buzzer when Sprewell 
leaves Dell Curry wide open for a game-winning 3-pointer. Van 
Gundy's favorite reporters start calling Sprewell a ``chucker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	March 11 -- Knicks make last-minute effort to acquire Stephon  
Marbury from Minnesota, offering Sprewell and Chris Childs. The New 
Jersey Nets get him instead. 
</P>
<P>
	March 12 -- Knicks score just 63 points and lose by 13 to the  
miserable Chicago Bulls. On the plane ride home, little-used 
reserve Dennis Scott is goofing off with his buddies, Sprewell and 
Rick Brunson. Van Gundy cuts him. 
</P>
<P>
	March 14 -- NBC reports that Van Gundy could be fired if the  
Knicks lose their game that night against Charlotte. Van Gundy's 
wife, Kim, stands in the back of the room at his pre-game meeting 
with reporters looking concerned. Knicks win.

<HEADLINE>  Paris Air Show Opens With Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- The world's largest air show opened on  
an ominous note today when a prototype of Russia's most advanced 
fighter jet crashed during a flight demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue and white Sukhoi-30 MK had just finished fluttering  
like a leaf in a controlled descent when it appeared to lose power 
coming out of a dive at the 43rd Paris Air Show. The plane plunged 
to the ground, appeared to lightly touch it, then soared back into 
the air with its tail aflame. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the two pilots ejected from the jet and the plane crashed.  
Two muffled blasts were heard and black smoke billowed from the 
crash site on the airfield, far from spectators. The pilots weren't 
injured, the air show's organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the moment we don't know if it's a mechanical incident or  
if he flew too low,'' said Patrick Guerin, an air show spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin engine jet crashed hours after French President Jacques  
Chirac inaugurated the eight-day event on a day reserved for the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,800 aerospace companies from 40 countries are  
participating in the show, which is held every other year at Le 
Bourget Airport north of Paris. Producers of military aircraft, 
cruise missiles and other state-of-the-art weaponry are exhibiting 
their goods alongside makers of civilian airliners and business 
jets. 
</P>
<P>
	All are vying to sell in a market made increasingly competitive  
by cutbacks in defense spending by cash-strapped governments and a 
weakening demand for passenger planes. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a concerted sales pitch, F-16 and Eurofighter jets  
looped and corkscrewed through the overcast skies above the 
airfield. Spectators felt their chests shake when pilots gunned the 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin's C-130J, a ponderous four-engine military  
transport, arced steeply over the tarmac before landing to let the 
Sukhoi take its turn in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's leisurely mood suddenly grew anxious three minutes  
later when the Russian jet crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he tried to recover, he couldn't,'' said Edmond  
Marchegay, the show's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The last plane to crash at the air show was also Russian -- a  
MiG-29 that went down in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, when you crash in such a way, you are not helping  
your sales and marketing campaign,'' said Oreste Fabbro, a 
marketing manager for the Eurofighter, which is built by a 
consortium of German, Spanish, British and Italian firms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bengt Adamsson, a sales executive with Saab AB of  
Sweden, a maker of the delta-wing Gripen fighter, said that 
accidents during test flights are not unusual. The crash of the 
Sukhoi probably would not hurt its sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perspective customers have an awareness of these kinds of  
things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The air show is expected to generate millions of dollars in  
sales, and orders have already started rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolls-Royce said Saturday it had received an order worth up to  
$88 million to supply the engines for Brazil-made Embraer RG-145 
jets ordered by an Italian airline, Al Italia Express.

<HEADLINE> Director Mazursky Misses Old Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Veteran filmmaker Paul Mazursky misses the good  
old days of Hollywood when the director was king. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had 20 years of doing whatever I wanted,'' Mazursky says in  
Saturday's New York Post. But now ``Power is with movie stars.... 
I've been having trouble getting the movies I want made.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To stay busy, the director of such films as ``Bob &AMP; Carol &AMP; Ted  
&AMP; Alice'' and ``Down and Out in Beverly Hills'' has written a 
memoir: ``Show Me The Magic.'' It contains anecdotes from his long 
career about stars ranging from Peter Sellers to Little Richard. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazursky, who turns 70 next year, isn't worried about slowing  
down. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm this age only physically,'' he said. ``I have the same  
insecurity I've always had. I haven't achieved a wonderful sense of 
peace and calm. I'm still excited about doing things and getting 
movies made.''

<HEADLINE> Top NBA Prospects Show Up at Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) -- While most of the aspiring NBA draft  
picks were already in the Chicago area for the pre-draft camp, some 
of those considered the sure top choices arrived Saturday for 
physicals and to talk with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami of Ohio forward Wally Szczerbiak expressed why most of the  
top prospects did not want to participate in the camp run by the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I vaulted myself into the lottery pick area, I didn't  
want to take my chances of getting hurt,'' Szczerbiak said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others virtually ensured of being among the first names called  
on June 30 in Washington, didn't sound too concerned about which 
team selected them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting picked is the only thing that matters,'' guard Jason  
Terry of Arizona said. ``Just to hear your name called is good 
enough. Once you get there, you've got to do the work, anyway, so 
you just hopefully want to get picked in a good situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland guard Steve Francis has been mentioned as being a  
possible No. 1 overall pick by the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be nice just to put on an NBA uniform of any team.''  
Francis said. ``Just to see your uniform in a store with your name 
on it is something I would want to see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other top players who arrived Saturday were Duke forward Elton  
Brand, Utah guard Andre Miller and Aleksandar Radojevic, a 7-foot-3 
center from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke forward Corey Maggette, who declared for the draft after  
his freshman year, was not invited. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, the consensus national player of the year last season as  
a sophomore, refuted assertions that he is not as tall as the 
6-foot-8 he was listed as while playing at Duke. Some have 
expressed doubts he can measure up to the competition in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad I'm here to prove the critics wrong and show my true  
height, I have the reach, I have athleticism, I have quickness, I 
have strength,'' he said. ``That's what you need in basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak held an open workout Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want everyone to see what I can do, '' he said. ``I wanted  
to make sure that no one overlooks me just because they haven't 
seen me. I'm a lot more versatile and athletic than (people) 
think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, who played just one season at Maryland but may have led  
the nation in impressive highlight clips, has found himself 
compared to Allen Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers, the NBA's 
leading scorer last season. The comparison with Iverson on and off 
the court is one Francis can live with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I bring my own style of basketball to the NBA,''  
Francis said. ``Just because what me and Allen have been through a 
lot of people are going to try compare (us). That's a compliment to 
me because he's worked real hard to get to where he is and I've 
worked real hard to get to where I am.''

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Protested at Commencement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) -- This week's commencement ceremony at  
Evergreen State College had caps, gowns and the words of condemned 
murderer Mumia Abu-Jamal echoing throughout the exercise for 13 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of the approximately 800 graduates walked out as  
Abu-Jamal's audiotaped speech was played Friday for the audience of 
several thousand. Two dozen other graduates stood and turned their 
backs, and still others wore yellow armbands of support. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters -- including Maureen Faulkner, the widow of the  
Philadelphia police officer shot by Abu-Jamal in 1981 -- also 
attended the ceremony. Abu-Jamal's participation, Ms. Faulkner 
said, was ``not fitting for a graduation ceremony. A classroom, 
maybe, but not a graduation ceremony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another protester had a replica of an electric chair and a sign  
reading: ``A positive role model for Mumia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students' selection of Abu-Jamal as a speaker had turned into a  
political tempest. Gov. Gary Locke canceled his scheduled 
appearance at the ceremony, and Majority Whip Tom Delay took to the 
House floor on Thursday to ask for a moment of silence to protest 
the students' choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal's jailhouse writings about the justice system and his  
efforts to win a new trial have given him worldwide attention. A 
symbol for death penalty opponents, he insists he is innocent and 
his conviction was the result a biased judge and an ineffective 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal has been on death row since 1982. No execution date  
has been set. He is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Some students supported Abu-Jamal's inclusion in the ceremony.  
Malka Fenyvesi said Abu-Jamal was not invited to ``to create a lot 
of bad feelings'' but rather to create a forum for a ``marginalized 
segment of our society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther, drew  
parallels between British colonial rule and black U.S. political 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why was it right for people to revolt against the British  
because of taxation without representation and somehow wrong for 
truly unrepresented Africans in America to revolt against 
America?'' he asked. ``For any repressed people, revolution, 
according to the Declaration of Independence, is a right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	College President Jane Jervis told the crowd before Abu-Jamal's  
remarks were played that people should ``be aware of the pain and 
outrage'' of Ms. Faulkner and police officers, and of the right of 
diverse voices to be heard.

<HEADLINE> NATO Peacekeeping Forces Glance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NATO peacekeeping forces for Kosovo and the countries that will  
provide most of the troops: 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	BRITAIN: 12,000 troops, including the force commander, Lt. Gen.  
Mike Jackson. He will establish a headquarters in Kosovo's capital, 
Pristina, and most of the British contingent will be deployed in 
that area. The sector includes the central Drenica region, a 
mountainous area that was a stronghold of the rebel Kosovo 
Liberation Army. Other NATO peacekeepers in this zone: Norwegians, 
who have secured the Grand Hotel and other sites in the center of 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	UNITED STATES: 7,000 troops, mostly from the Marines and the  
Army. Most will be stationed in southeastern Kosovo near the 
Macedonian border, with headquarters in Gnjilane. Although only a 
relative handful of American troops entered Kosovo on Saturday, 
U.S. Apache attack helicopters flew air cover for the mostly 
British and French convoys. The U.S. sector is in an area that was 
relatively quiet for most of the Kosovo conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	FRANCE: 7,000 troops. Deployed in the northern sector with  
headquarters in Kosovska Mitrovica. Will be reinforced by 1,200 
soldiers from the United Arab Emirates. The French area includes 
strategic routes from Kosovo into Serbia and Montenegro, as well as 
an area of recent fighting between Serb and KLA forces. A French 
tank regiment entered Kosovo on Saturday after being blocked for 
most of the day by a minefield that the Serbs had failed to 
identify, as provided for under the peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ITALY: 5,000 troops. Deployed in western Kosovo with  
headquarters in Pec, the scene of some of the most horrendous 
ethnic purges of the Kosovo conflict. Pec is also the seat of the 
Serbian Orthodox Church in the province and sits along a major 
route into Montenegro. The Italians are expected to begin deploying 
into Kosovo early Sunday, and their route will take them through 
scenes of recent heavy fighting between Yugoslav and ethnic 
Albanian rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	GERMANY: 8,500 troops. Stationed in the southwestern city of  
Prizren, it will be the first time the German army has been 
deployed in such large numbers since end of World War II. The 
Germans will enter Kosovo on Sunday from northern Albania, 
traveling a route where American B-52 bombers hammered Serb forces 
last weekend and where ethnic Albanian rebels tried unsuccessfully 
to open a supply corridor into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	RUSSIA: Russia has said it is prepared to send up to 10,000  
troops. A convoy of Russian troops arrived in the Kosovo capital of 
Pristina early Saturday after Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov assured 
Washington they would not without a formal agreement on command and 
control relationships to NATO. The Russians effectively control 
Pristina airport, which NATO had hoped to use as a headquarters. 
NATO officials in Bosnia say another Russian force is massed near 
the Serbian border prepared to move to Kosovo.

</P>
<P>
	Hall of Famers Tom Seaver, Yogi Berra and Ralph Kiner, as well

<HEADLINE> Bush Tests Campaign Waters in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush plunged into the 2000  
presidential race Saturday, declaring ``there's no turning back'' 
from his bid to usher in a new era of Republican politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud to be a compassionate conservative,'' he said.  
``And on this ground I will make my stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flying from Austin aboard his ``Great Expectations'' charter  
plane, the Texas governor embarked on his first campaign trip -- 
already positioned as the party's leader in polls, money-raising 
and endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running for the presidency of the United States,'' Bush  
said, making his intentions more clear than ever. ``There's no 
turning back and I intend to be the next president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican rivals, Democratic operatives and more than 200  
journalists followed Bush's every step, taking measure of whether 
he is prepared for the pressures of a front-running campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush displayed a knack for working small crowds: shaking hands,  
patting shoulders, grabbing elbows, signing autographs and joking 
with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quick with a quip and sporting a crooked smile, Bush showed a  
hands-on, familiar campaign style reminiscent of President 
Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like those shades,'' Bush told Dorothy Thompson of Des  
Moines, placing his hands firmly on both of her shoulders and 
peeking behind the glasses. ``I like those eyes!'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Yvonne Peasley reached out to shake his hand, Bush noticed  
a camera dangling from her wrist. ``Let me have that,'' Bush said, 
slipping the camera off her arm and handing it to an aide. ``Let's 
get us a picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What a sweet, nice man,'' Peasley said later.  
</P>
<P>
	That is the impression Bush hopes to leave as he introduces his  
brand of ``compassionate conservative'' politics to Iowa and New 
Hampshire on this four-day swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In his centerpiece address at a country barbecue, Bush promised  
to end ``this season of cynicism'' in American politics. 
Republicans can be conservative without being mean about it, he 
said, offering these prescriptions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Cut taxes, but help people save and make more money.  
</P>
<P>
	--Cut welfare rolls, but ``confront the suffering that remains.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Retain local control of schools, but ``make sure that no single  
child gets left behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that this approach has been criticized, but why? Is  
compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our party be led 
by someone who boasts of a hard heart?'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of his campaign came quickly, from both parties.  
</P>
<P>
	``Compassionate conservatism is a contrived cop-out,'' said Joe  
Andrew of the Democratic National Committee, who pigeonholed 
reporters as they stepped out of Bush's motorcade for the address. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising that he would launch his campaign on such  
defensive ground,'' said Brian Kennedy, political director for 
sagging GOP hopeful Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to cede to Bush, Alexander, John Kasich and Elizabeth  
Dole took their GOP campaigns to Iowa on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who petted pigs at a pork expo, called herself a  
``courageous conservative,'' implying that Bush has failed to take 
stands on tough national issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes watched Kennedy and Andrew walk  
from reporter to reporter. With a nervous laugh, she said, ``Bright 
lights attract moths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Bush's policy proposals were promises to reduce marginal  
tax rates, allow Americans to invest their Social Security taxes 
and add ``a touch of iron'' to the U.S. military. He leveled one 
attack against President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, saying 
``they did not invent prosperity'' in America. 
</P>
<P>
	His top goals:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Draw a moral line'' and encourage personal responsibility  
from Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Get faith-based organizations and such as churches involved in  
easing social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improve schools so that ``no child will be left behind.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, is many ways the phantom frontrunner. Though dominate  
in a campaign he avoided until now, the son of former President 
George Bush is little-known outside Texas. He has held elective 
office for just 4 1/2 years and has little experience as a national 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Bush with a wide lead over GOP foes, though pollsters  
say the Texas governor benefits from people confusing the younger 
and old Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Time magazine survey found 63 percent of Americans see  
George W. Bush as a lot like his father. A Newsweek poll found 49 
percent of Americans feel that being the son of a former president 
will help Bush is his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-elected governor also is being helped by a craving  
among Republicans for a winner, after Clinton won in 1992 and 1996 
and his party picked up House seats in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's blend of conservative politics couched in soothing,  
moderate rhetoric could help move the GOP to the center -- much as 
Clinton refocused his party away from its liberal extremes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Bush formally would announce his candidacy in the  
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the first step by pledging to compete in the Ames, Iowa,  
straw poll in August. Trying to lower expectations, aides said the 
odds were against Bush winning the event -- and it was unclear how 
much time and money Bush is willing to devote to contest. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bank Stops Sharing Customer Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Two days after Minnesota sued U.S. Bank  
for selling customer data to telemarketers, the nation's largest 
bank announced it will stop sharing the information with marketing 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our customers consider the personal and financial information  
we maintain about them highly confidential,'' Ken Lewis, president 
of Bank of America, said Friday. ``This is the right thing to do 
for our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch accused U.S. Bank of  
selling sensitive data ranging from customer names, Social Security 
numbers, birth dates, credit limits, marital status, occupation and 
home ownership status. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America officials said the decision was not prompted by  
the Minnesota lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been looking at re-engineering these processes for four  
or five weeks now,'' said bank spokesman John Cleghorn. ``We 
thought this was the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, the bank will not share any customer  
information with marketers who offer their products and services to 
Bank of America customers, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, the bank will not enable telemarketers to  
call its customers offering products unrelated to their financial 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America, with $614 billion in assets, has branches in 22  
states and the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Clinics See Rise in Teen Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mental health clinics and therapists across  
the country say they've seen a surge of younger patients since the 
Columbine High School shootings as parents and educators seek help 
for kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Magellan Behavioral Health, with more than 60 million adults and  
children in its programs nationwide, said its calls in May jumped 
25 percent over the same month last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears that people all across the country are so shaken by  
this incident that they're not taking any chances,'' said Erin 
Somers, a spokeswoman for Magellan, which is based in Columbia, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 20 massacre in Littleton, Colo., in which two students  
killed 12 of their classmates and one teacher, followed similar 
attacks in Pearl, Miss.; West Paducah, Ky.; Jonesboro, Ark.; and 
Springfield, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry has seen  
calls to its referral service more than double over the first five 
months of 1999 from the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Gault, a child psychiatrist in the Chicago suburb of  
Northbrook, Ill., said he has received 15 referrals from schools to 
evaluate students over the past seven weeks, compared to the one or 
two he normally receives in the waning weeks of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been doing this for 20 years and I've never had this  
many,'' Gault said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indianapolis, the summertime lull hasn't arrived yet at  
Charter Indianapolis Health Care System, an 80-bed hospital where 
people fight addictions and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had to open up 12 more beds in the last six weeks for  
adolescents and children,'' said Roxane Harcourt, chief operating 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Harcourt said the hospital has seen a 30 percent increase in the  
number of patients under 17 over the past six weeks due to a surge 
in referrals from schools and physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Families are more comfortable going to their general doctors''  
with concerns about their children's mental health, Harcourt said. 
``And the doctors themselves are more likely to say, 'Let's have a 
professional eyeball this kid to see what's really going on.''' 
</P>
<P>
	David Fassler, a child psychiatrist in Burlington, Vt., said his  
4,000-patient practice has grown by 25 percent in the past six 
months, largely because of an influx of teenagers and children. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had to ask some adult patients to come at 6 a.m.,''  
Fassler said. ``But you have to remember that, even with this 
increase across the country, still only one child in four receives 
the help they need.''

<HEADLINE> ACLU Vows Appeal of Cuss Conviction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANDISH, Mich. (AP) -- The fight over dirty language in Michigan  
isn't over. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union promised  
to appeal after a canoeist was convicted of using profanities in 
front of children when he was dumped into the Rifle River last 
summer. The ACLU predicted the state's 102-year-old anti-swearing 
law would be ruled unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have every confidence that eventually a Michigan appellate  
court will strike it down, so no one else will ever have to go 
through the sort of strange and bizarre ordeal that Timothy Boomer 
has,'' defense lawyer William Street said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors in rural Arenac County, 130 miles north of Detroit,  
deliberated less than an hour Friday before convicting Boomer, 25. 
The factory worker from the Detroit suburbs could be jailed for 90 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Boomer did not show any reaction when the verdict was read.  
</P>
<P>
	He did not deny he let off steam after his canoe hit a rock on  
the river, but he said he didn't see any children and that his 
shouts were in jest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Timothy Boomer at worst said an `f-word' or two when he fell  
into the Rifle River,'' Street told jurors. ``It was not the sort 
of event that has now been exaggerated and blown all out of 
proportion. The people literally are trying to make a mountain out 
of a molehill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Richard Vollbach, the prosecutor, said witnesses testified  
that Boomer ``used the `f-word' at least a few dozen times with 
children present ... anywhere between 25 and, I believe, 70 times. 
They described Mr. Boomer with veins popping out of his neck; he 
was enraged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police began patrolling the river last summer after  
representatives of campgrounds and property owners complained that 
drunken, rowdy boaters were getting out of hand. A sheriff's deputy 
who was patrolling the river ticketed Boomer. 
</P>
<P>
	Street conceded that Boomer was part of a group that had been  
drinking beer on the river. But that didn't justify the cussing 
charge, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As much as they would like to have been able to ticket Timothy  
Boomer for being drunk, for being disorderly, they didn't bring the 
charge because they didn't have the facts,'' Street said. ``So they 
scraped 102 years deep into the bottom of the Michigan Criminal 
Code to bring this offense to the top.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vollbach countered: ``The defense arguments should send a chill  
up the spine of anyone who believes privacy, civility and decency 
have any place in this society.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1897 law prohibited cursing in front of women and children,  
but the judge in this case, Allen Yenior, ruled that the reference 
to women violated the equal protection clause of the U.S. 
Constitution.

<HEADLINE>  Garden Nightmare Sends Pacers Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers' championship mission failed  
again, stalled this time in the face of Spike Lee and the city they 
love to hate. 
</P>
<P>
	They've got to be getting sick of this by now.  
</P>
<P>
	Thought to be the team to beat in this post-Michael Jordan,  
lockout-shortened season, the Pacers were thwarted again Friday 
night with a 90-82 loss to the New York Knicks that might have 
surpassed the crushing devastation that Jordan and the Bulls 
inflicted on them last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe it was even worse.  
</P>
<P>
	``You can't compare this to losing to Chicago, because they were  
one of the best teams ever,'' Pacers point guard Mark Jackson said. 
``We're going home -- no disrespect to them -- but knowing that we 
feel we're the better team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the '90s, the Pacers have all the pride, experience and  
show-stopping qualities needed for thrilling postseason runs. In 
short, they have everything but rings; in fact, not even a trip to 
the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing elimination at Madison Square Garden, the Pacers were  
whistled into oblivion as Reggie Miller had only eight points to go 
with five fouls. Rik Smits fouled out with 20 points, and Jackson 
committed five personals and scored 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Pacers were called for 35 fouls, and the Knicks 16.  
New York shot 33 free throws, making 27. The Pacers were 9-for-9. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have several guys picking up four or five fouls and  
one guy fouling out,'' said Jackson, his voice trailing off. 
``Let's just hope the NBA Finals is a great series. They got what 
they wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During his Hall of Fame playing career with the Boston Celtics,  
Pacers coach Larry Bird was the beneficiary of foul calls. With 
``Larry Legend'' in a suit on the sideline, it was a different 
story. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tough deal when you play against New York,'' Bird said.  
``It's New York. You know you're not going to get a lot of calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers completed their Garden nightmare with 27 turnovers  
resulting in 26 points by the Knicks. As a result, the Pacers are 
0-4 in the Eastern Conference finals during their impressive but 
still undecorated run of success this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	What happens now? A year older, and with another crushing defeat  
on their collective conscience, do the Pacers stay together and 
make another run? 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this team,'' forward Antonio Davis said. ``I love the  
guys. I think we can get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When they lost to the Bulls in seven games in the conference  
finals last summer, the Pacers vowed to carry Jordan's torch and 
win the first championship after his retirement. They practiced 
together during the lockout, reminded themselves all season that 
nothing less than a championship would do. 
</P>
<P>
	They are right back where they started. This time, it was the  
Knicks showing them the way back to Indiana -- for the third time in 
five playoff series between the rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys were counting on me to put them on my backs, and I  
didn't do it this time,'' said Miller, whose long face contorted 
into an expression of disbelief when he picked up those two fouls. 
``I have to take responsibility for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers' nerves never frayed, their determination didn't  
falter even when Miller picked up his third and fourth fouls in a 
span of 13 seconds with less than five minutes left in the third. 
With Miller on the bench, Jalen Rose took his customary spot in 
Lee's corner of the Garden, the 31st Street and Seventh Avenue 
corner, to hit several clutch shots that kept them in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller picked up those two crucial fouls while trying -- and  
failing -- to guard New York's Allan Houston, who had 32 points. 
Then, when New York took a four-point lead, and then a six-point 
lead down the stretch, Miller missed the kind of backbreaking shots 
he's come to personify in this building. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to describe his shooting, Miller said simply,  
``Horrendous. Horrendous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last miss came with the clock ticking inside 30 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
	Now, start the clock on the Pacers' offseason.

<HEADLINE> Experts See Computer Virus Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nervous calls to computer support lines dropped  
off sharply Saturday after two frenzied days of combat against a 
software bug that attacks with the speed of the Melissa virus and 
the destructiveness of the Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer experts, however, feared that the spread of  
Worm.Explore.Zip will pick up again when employees return to work 
Monday, adding to the tens of thousands of machines infected with 
the file-eating bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus, first detected June 6 in Israel, did most of its  
damage on Thursday and Friday, infecting computer systems at 
several big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities were investigating the origins of the bug,  
but offered no details of their probe on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip combines the worst elements of the two viruses  
that swept across the Internet earlier this spring, using e-mail 
trickery similar to Melissa's to overwhelm computer networks and 
attacking computer users individually with the Chernobyl-like 
destruction of their computer files. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus disguises itself as a timely e-mail reply from an  
acquaintance, inviting the recipient to open an attached file that 
sends the virus worming into each computer's hard drive and 
ricocheting around companies connected to that machine by a 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the worst hit was airplane maker Boeing, which was still  
assessing the damage on Saturday. The ``vast majority'' of the 
company's e-mail system was back in operation, said spokesman Dave 
Suffia. Other big names affected included Intel, Microsoft, General 
Electric, AT&AMP;T and Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	With Melissa and Chernobyl still a fresh memory for most,  
computer systems managers reacted quickly when word of 
Worm.Explore.Zip began to spread by Wednesday, possibly helping 
contain the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	But for computers already affected, there wasn't much optimism  
that lost files would be retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lawyer called Thursday evening and said the virus destroyed  
a bunch of his files. He had to be in court Friday morning and, 
needless to say, he wasn't happy,'' said Barry Raven, a technical 
support analyst for the software maker Network Associates. ``Once 
they're destroyed they're probably not recoverable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-virus workers reported Friday and Saturday that the  
momentum behind this outbreak, though very heavy, seemed to be 
slower than with Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Although calling volume was four times heavier than normal on  
Friday at a Network Associates facility in Texas, it was also just 
a quarter as heavy as the volume during the Melissa outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone lines were almost silent Saturday morning at the  
center, dropping off from about 800 customer calls on Friday to 
just a handful by early afternoon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday we were bombarded, we had calls right up until the  
close, but it's dead right now,'' said Raven, cautioning that the 
sharp dropoff could prove fleeting when people return to work on 
Monday and turn on their computers. ``There are a lot of people who 
don't keep up with the news and haven't found out about (the virus) 
yet, and others who, for one reason or another, decided to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is known to attack only those computers using  
Microsoft operating systems Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. 
Rival operating systems such as Macintosh and Unix apparently are 
not vulnerable.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five former Iraqi military officers who  
claimed they fought Saddam Hussein and then spent 2 1/2 years in 
custody fighting deportation from the United States are happy to 
finally be getting out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The system here is good, but the people who represent (the  
government) have brought shame to this country,'' said Mohammed 
Jwer Abboud Al-Ammary, a former military cargo plane pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iraqis may stay in Nebraska until a friendly country agrees  
to accept them, a judge ruled Friday. A sixth Iraqi refused the 
agreement, the end to a saga that began in 1996 when the U.S. 
airlifted 6,500 Iraqis from Turkey following a failed coup in Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The men's families were granted asylum, but immigration  
authorities sought deportation and claimed they were spies for 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	The men said they were grateful for the efforts to free them,  
especially those of former CIA Director James Woolsey, now a 
private lawyer. But they also feel betrayed by the U.S. government, 
which they say promised asylum. 
</P>
<P>
	Immigration Judge D.D. Sitgraves denied the men asylum in March  
1998 and ordered them deported, saying they could be double agents. 
The men claimed they would be executed if sent home. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities justified their imprisonment largely on secret  
evidence, a practice in immigration cases that has come under fire 
from federal lawmakers and activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the INS unsealed some of the evidence -- testimony  
about the six Iraqis from FBI agents who discussed hunches, 
distaste for the detainees and their feelings about Arab culture. 
Woolsey called the detention ``a stain on the honor of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sixth Iraqi, Ali Yasim Mohammed Karim, said he will never  
sign the freedom deal. Authorities have given him until July 9 to 
change his mind. He could eventually be deported to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining five will be released within two weeks to Lincoln,  
Neb., where their families were resettled. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, the men must abandon any claims for asylum here  
but may remain in Nebraska until they are deported to a friendly 
country. They must report to the INS daily, stay at home at night, 
accept wire taps on their telephones and stay in the country.

<HEADLINE> Gotti Codefendants Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A judge sentenced father-and-son  
gangsters to federal prison terms, granting leniency to the ailing 
father but imposing the maximum on the son. 
</P>
<P>
	``You saw what your father's life was like and you saw what that  
life brought upon your family, particularly the women,'' Judge 
Barrington Parker told Craig DePalma on Friday. ``You ... cast your 
lot with Gotti and associates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DePalma, 33, who was indicted with John A. ``Junior'' Gotti,  
pleaded guilty in January to, among other charges, racketeering, 
extortion and loansharking. Parker could have sentenced him to as 
few as 70 months, but he chose the maximum of 87 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, the judge went to a medical center in Valhalla to  
sentence Gregory DePalma, who had admitted to gambling, extortion, 
labor racketeering and tax crimes. DePalma, 67, suffers from lung 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	When the elder DePalma pleaded guilty in January, a sentence of  
between 10 and 13 years was expected. But the judge departed from 
the guidelines, citing his ill health, and imposed just 70 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The DePalmas were soldiers in the Gambino family, serving John  
J. Gotti and then, after his imprisonment, his son, John A. Gotti. 
</P>
<P>
	Junior Gotti pleaded guilty in April to racketeering and other  
charges and faces up to 87 months in prison at his sentencing next 
month.

<HEADLINE> Dole Offers Farmers Tax Breaks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Declaring farmers ``America's heart and  
soul,'' Republican presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole today 
offered a 10-point package giving new tax breaks and targeting aid 
to a struggling livestock industry. 
</P>
<P>
	She put no price tag on her package, but she made clear she  
would not pinch pennies in a state that produces a quarter of the 
nation's hogs -- and starts the presidential nominating season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, speaking at the World Pork Expo at the Iowa State  
Fairgrounds, referred often to her ties to the state and the long 
political history in Iowa of her husband, Bob Dole, the 1996 GOP 
presidential nominee. 
</P>
<P>
	``For almost a quarter of a century, I've been living with a guy  
who is an agriculture expert,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her plan seeks to bolster exports as well, seeking to include  
China in world trade and creating new hemispheric trading zones. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next president, whomever she may be, must stabilize the  
farm economy by exercising leadership to expand domestic markets 
and increase exports,'' she said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole called farmers are ``the backbone of this nation'' and  
need help. Aides said her proposal will resonate in a key political 
state where the farm economy has suffered. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's proposal calls for allowing farmers to deduct 100  
percent of their health insurance costs from their income taxes, 
and for elimination of the federal inheritance tax on family farms. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, she wants the Clinton administration to release  
$145 million in emergency assistance approved by Congress and 
propose new legislation forcing meatpackers to disclose the prices 
they pay for animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Her speech also underscores her support for ethanol-blended  
fuels, a key issue in Iowa because ethanol is distilled from corn 
and offers a new market for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a strong supporter of ethanol, and I have been for  
years,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said her package offers a sharp contrast with Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush, the leader in polls for the GOP presidential 
nomination, whom detractors accuse of being vague on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing the same crowd, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander  
also focused on farm economy problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Bill Clinton has been diddling, and Al Gore has been  
cheerleading, more farmers have been going out of business than 
during the farm crisis of the 1980s,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, meanwhile, was making his initial foray today into Iowa  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	While unemployment is low and the nation's economy solid,  
farmers have suffered with low commodity prices, particularly in 
the pork industry. Iowa is the nation's largest pork producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring meatpackers to disclose the prices they pay is an  
important issue, because many pork producers suspect that packers 
cut sweetheart deals with giant mega-hog operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only fair that all producers know the going rate for  
hogs,'' Mrs. Dole said. ``Free markets depend on the free flow of 
information. On a level playing field, everyone can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other pieces of her farm package include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Boosting exports under the Food for Peace program, and fully  
utilizing the Conservation Reserve Program. That's designed to take 
36.4 million of environmentally fragile acres out of production, 
but only 30 million have been set aside. 
</P>
<P>
	--Calling for China's entry into the World Trade Organization, a  
move targeting a giant market but vehemently opposed by 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	--Pushing for enactment of free-trade legislation, including  
giving the president the authority to negotiate ``fast track'' 
trade deals. 
</P>
<P>
	--Calling for a Western Hemisphere free-trading zone and for  
breaking down barriers to trade with the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax issues are major complaints of farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	As independent business operators, they must provide for their  
own health insurance. While companies can deduct the cost of 
providing health coverage for workers, farmers cannot. 
</P>
<P>
	The estate tax issue is also important, because many farmers  
worry that their operations will have to be sold on their death to 
pay the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's wrong to make farmers visit Uncle Sam and the undertaker  
on the same day,'' Mrs. Dole declared. 
</P>
<P>
	This is one of Iowa's most hectic political weekends as  
Republican presidential hopefuls crisscross the state. In addition 
to Dole and Bush, Ohio Rep. John Kasich, Alexander and conservative 
activist Gary Bauer were campaigning here.

<HEADLINE>  New Spring Football League Forms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For now, the best way to assess the new spring  
football league that was announced Friday is by its initials -- IFF. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, the International Football Federation, which  
hopes to start in February, has a chance to succeed IF: 
</P>
<P>
	--it can get a television contract; it is seeking one and its  
last resort is showing games on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	--it can bring respectable crowds to such venues as Giants  
Stadium and the Rose Bowl by drawing fans from other spring sports 
-- baseball, the NBA and NHL playoffs, the WNBA and Arena Football. 
</P>
<P>
	--it avoids the internal bickering and overspending that doomed  
such football ventures as the World League in the 1970s and the 
USFL in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Right now, there are 13 proposed franchises -- Honolulu was a  
last-minute entry Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There are five in NFL cities -- New York, Chicago, Detroit,  
Boston and Denver. The others include two in the Los Angeles area 
and franchises in Toronto, San Jose, Calif., Texas, Toronto and 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want football 12 months of the year,'' said entertainer  
Dionne Warwick, who will be a part owner of the two franchises in 
Southern California, which lost two NFL teams after the 1994 season 
and is having trouble getting together on an expansion team. 
</P>
<P>
	The new league is the brainchild of Dennis Murphy, who helped  
found both the American Basketball Association and the World Hockey 
Association in the '70s. They eventually merged some of their 
franchise with the NBA and NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marketplace is better now than it was then,'' Murphy said  
at a news conference. ``Then there were three networks. Now there 
are 200 channels on Direct TV, cable, what have you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy and Edward Litwack, the league's president and chief  
executive officer, acknowledged having preliminary discussions with 
NBC and Turner Broadcasting, the networks that lost out in the $18 
billion NFL contract negotiated in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But both executives said neither NBC nor Turner will be ready  
for the inaugural season, which will run from February to July next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC and Turner Sports previously said they are considering  
sponsorship of a new football league but no plan has been put 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack runs his own cable television systems that could be used  
for a syndicated package and sold individually to local stations or 
cable networks. He also said the games could be shown on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Litwack emphasized that unlike the earlier leagues, the IFF  
would not threaten the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to live in harmony,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Mayors Seek Revenue From Web Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Poor Ron Kirk. The Dallas mayor and chairman  
of the U.S. Conference of Mayors city economic task force may have 
the most unenviable duty a politician can face. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk's mission is to make the public see the need for another  
tax, this one on Internet sales. In blunt terms on Saturday, Kirk 
tried to enlist his colleagues to join him in a fight for millions 
of dollars in lost tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have a persuasive argument before the public,'' Kirk  
said Saturday during a panel discussion at the annual mayors 
meeting. ``But we have to explain that when you are sitting at home 
in your virtual world and you have a short (circuit) and a fire 
breaks out, do you want us to send a virtual fire truck or a real 
big red fire truck'' to save you. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk and others oppose the Internet Tax Freedom Act, a law  
passed last year that places a three-year ban on taxing online 
sales and access. They said it results in fewer dollars for public 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``People care about their schools, streets and parks but they  
don't pay for themselves,'' the mayor explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the law say they don't want to place a tax  
stranglehold on fledgling Internet trade, but the growing 
popularity of Internet shopping puts Main Street merchants -- who 
must pay a slew of local, state and federal taxes -- at a severe 
disadvantage with their electronic competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lost revenue is going to be made up by the consumer at  
some point,'' said William McCabe Jr., chairman of the 
International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade organization for 
the shopping center industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Some towns may be seeing the impact already.  
</P>
<P>
	Karen Hasara, mayor of Springfield, Ill., said her community has  
seen a recent decline in sales tax receipts from Main Street 
merchants. ``We aren't sure it's from Internet sales, but we are 
beginning to feel the effects,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the law argue that information shouldn't be taxed  
and that tax savings will stimulate further online development. 
They also maintain a single Internet transaction could become the 
target of dozens of state and local taxes without the tax 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton supported the three-year cooling off period  
before Internet taxes could be imposed, saying it would keep online 
business flourishing. 
</P>
<P>
	An independent panel appointed by Congress called the Advisory  
Commission on Electronic Commerce may ultimately decide if the 
taxman ever grabs a share of cybersales. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, which begins its work on June 22, was created to  
develop recommendations about how federal officials should handle 
taxing the multibillion dollar Internet commerce industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk, a commission member, said it shouldn't be that hard to  
figure out ways to tax online transactions with harming new online 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an industry that lends itself to problem solving,'' he  
said.

	U.S., Russia Working on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Amid more confusion in Moscow over  
who decided to send Russian troops into Kosovo, U.S. and Russian 
negotiators worked feverishly today to design a formal job for 
Russia in the Kosovo peacekeeping force. But there was no immediate 
result and no sign the Russian column was planning to leave, as 
Russia's foreign minister had promised. Streaming into Kosovo's 
capital, almost unopposed by retreating Serbs, NATO peacekeepers 
came face-to-face today with the Russian troops who beat them to 
the city.

	U.S. Suspects Some of Smallpox Weapon  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Government officials say Russia, Iraq and North  
Korea are probably concealing the deadly smallpox virus for 
military use, The New York Times reports in Sunday editions. A 
secret federal intelligence assessment was completed late last 
year. It was based on evidence that includes disclosures by a 
senior Soviet defector, blood samples from the North Korean 
soldiers that show smallpox vaccinations and the fairly recent 
manufacture of smallpox vaccine by Iraq, according to the report. 
Officials told the Times that the assessment was an important 
factor in President Clinton's recent decision to reverse course and 
forgo destruction of American stockpiles of the virus.

severely disturbed patient, the doctor's family said Saturday. 
Joseph Brooks Jr., 27, killed Dr. Reuven Bar-Levav and a woman and 
injured four others before killing himself at Bar-Levav's office 
Friday afternoon. One of the wounded remained hospitalized in fair 
condition Saturday. The gunman had been diagnosed elsewhere as a 
paranoid schizophrenic and had come to the office several times, 
said Dr. Leora Bar-Levav.

	ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) -- Louisiana's Republican leaders decided  
Saturday to hold a 2000 presidential caucus one week ahead of 
Iowa's traditional first-in-the-nation caucus. But the question of 
whether the Republican National Committee would recognize the 
caucus was not addressed by the 160 Republicans who gathered for 
the vote. Instead, the members of the Louisiana GOP spent much of 
the time arguing over and eventually rejecting a competing proposal 
for Louisiana to hold the country's first-ever presidential primary 
with Internet voting.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Communist North Korea sent patrol  
boats across a disputed sea border Saturday after threatening to 
attack South Korean warships in contested waters of the Yellow Sea. 
The American-led U.N. Command, which oversees the fragile truce 
between the two bitter rivals, urged North Korea -- for a third time 
this week -- to hold a border military meeting to end the standoff. 
The armed standoff in the Cold War's last flashpoint entered its

their ships nearly opened fire yesterday.

voice and the famed tenor's debut in the Arab world was wild. 
Cheers and whistles greeted the Italian when he performed at 
Beirut's Sports City stadium, a site itself symbolizing Beirut's 
wartime death and its postwar recovery. Pavarotti thanked the 
sellout crowd of 20,000 people who, according to organizers, came

new experience of getting around by underground rail instead of by 
car and bus. The premiere of the Hollywood segment marked a major

Nieuwendyk, almost forced to score with Brett Hull out and Mike 
Modano hampered by a serious wrist injury, had two goals and the 
depleted Stars regained home-ice advantage in the series, taking a 
2-1 edge. The Stars had every reason to lose but didn't, killing 
off eight Buffalo power plays -- one a two-man advantage -- while 
overcoming a groin injury that forced Hull to the locker room after 
less than three minutes of ice time. Hull is eighth in NHL playoff 
history in scoring and had the game-winning goal in Game 2 in 
Dallas.

<HEADLINE> Health-Care Coverage Grows for Pets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Being diagnosed with a serious disease once meant  
an instant death sentence for Fido or Fluffy. Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only do people pamper pets, a growing number are paying up  
to $6,000 for kidney transplants and chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``And why not?'' said Michael Garvey, who chairs the Animal  
Medical Center of New York's emergency department. ``After a long 
hard day at work, your pet is always happy to see you. You can't 
always say that about all the people in your home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garvey is one of about 2,600 animal doctors in Chicago for a  
weekend conference on pet treatments unheard of a few years ago and 
still largely unknown to many pet owners. The vets are specialists 
in internal medicine, cardiology, neurology and oncology. 
</P>
<P>
	While some may smirk at the notion of using endoscopes or  
ultrasound to pinpoint a tumor in a family pet, it is serious 
business for those who want to keep their pets as long as medically 
possible, said Phillip Bergman, a Houston-based animal oncologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see lots of dogs, cats and pocket pets -- hamsters, guinea  
pigs, ferrets,'' Bergman said. ``People form bonds with their pets 
and will do anything to avoid euthanasia. I'm not seeing people 
running away from the costs because they care that much for their 
pets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For those pet owners who do find it hard to pay $300 to $600 for  
chemotherapy or from $3,500 to $6,000 for a kidney transplant, 
there is help in the form of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pet health insurance has been out there for decades, but the  
industry has suffered from the worst marketing effort since the 
Edsel,'' said Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
	Monthly premiums range from $80 to $100, but don't cover regular  
checkups, Garvey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many remain unwilling to spend large sums to keep ill pets  
alive. Chicago resident Bill Gerstein, who has been rescuing stray 
dogs for more than a decade, thinks that kind of devotion is 
excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have these formerly stray mutts,'' Gerstein said. ``Of  
course, we take care of them. But no way would I invest too much 
money into them when there are always other stray mutts you can 
take in.''

<HEADLINE> Man Pays Speeding Ticket in Pennies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAUDE, Texas (AP) -- Angry about a $135 speeding ticket, an  
Amarillo man decided to give the authorities a penny for their 
thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, 13,513 pennies.  
</P>
<P>
	Randy McCain paid an extra $40 to have 270 rolls of pennies  
delivered to Armstrong County Justice of the Peace Beatrice T. 
Sturkie on Thursday. The coins weighed in at 78 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bank in Claude was mad,'' Ms. Sturkie told the Amarillo  
Globe-News. ``I thought it was hilarious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was ticketed last May for driving 90 mph in a 70-mph  
zone. He said he may have been speeding, but ``wasn't going as fast 
as they said I was going.''

<HEADLINE> Woods Looks Tough Heading Into Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- The dominance ended, and so did his reign  
atop the world ranking. Through it all, Tiger Woods insisted he 
would only get better. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't get much better than this heading into the U.S. Open.  
</P>
<P>
	David Duval may be the new No. 1, but all eyes are on Woods as  
he tries to reclaim his reputation as the most feared golfer in a 
championship that has given him the most trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tiger is coming back strong again,'' Ernie Els said. ``He's  
got that look in his eye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods drove the ball beautifully in Germany to win on a course  
framed by high rough. He won in the Memorial Tournament with a 
breathtaking short game. Except for one swing that led to a 
quadruple bogey in Dallas, he could have been 3-0 since his 
post-Masters break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if anybody can play the way he does,'' Jack  
Nicklaus said. ``He has the ability to do things that nobody else 
can do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The question is whether winning a U.S. Open is one of them.  
</P>
<P>
	For all the talk about Pinehurst No. 2, its greens shaped like  
the back of a spoon and the shaved collection areas that will 
demand imagination and touch like never before, the U.S. Open 
almost always comes down to patience. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's the one area Woods has yet to master.  
</P>
<P>
	Remember Oakland Hills? In his last U.S. Open as an amateur,  
Woods was leading in the first round until he played the last five 
holes at 9-over. He went to Congressional as the Masters champion 
in 1997, but ended any thought of a grand slam with two double 
bogeys in the first round. At The Olympic Club last year, he 
four-putted twice for double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
	``In U.S. Opens, you make a mistake and you're simply going to  
pay,'' said Els, a two-time Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods set a standard with his stunning victory in the Masters.  
He came within one stroke of a playoff in the British Open. He made 
an early move in the final round of the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. Open? Woods has only two rounds under par and his  
best finish was his tie for 18th last year, 10 strokes out of the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, he's just 23, and Pinehurst will be only his third  
U.S. Open as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
	As he says, he can only get better.  
</P>
<P>
	``Understanding how to play the game, shaping shots correctly,  
managing your emotions,'' Woods said. ``These are things that take 
time to learn. And I've been able to soak up all the mishaps that 
I've had in my life and applied it each and every time, and made it 
better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what he has learned about himself, Woods and everyone  
else will have to take a crash course on Pinehurst No. 2, the 
masterpiece of Scottish architect Donald Ross that hasn't had a 
professional major since the 1936 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Augusta made news by finally growing rough. Pinehurst will be  
unlike past U.S. Opens because it won't have any around the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every now and then, the USGA throws us a curve,'' Els said.  
``And this is one of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis Love III probably has as much experience as anyone. He  
used to play Pinehurst with his father, a renowned teaching pro who 
ran Golf Digest schools on the No. 2 course. Love first learned the 
pitch shot on the 14th hole, once played Pinehurst with Sam Snead 
and later won a North-South Amateur on famed No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	And even he isn't sure what to expect.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be what any of us who have played it in the  
past are used to,'' he said. ``You're not going to be able to get 
the ball on the green as much as you like it. Just like at Augusta, 
you're going to have to be very patient and hole a lot of putts for 
par.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only four times over the past 20 years has a third-round leader  
won the Open without going to a playoff. Most times, the best way 
to make up ground on the leader is to make par. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee Janzen trailed by seven strokes early in the final round at  
The Olympic Club last year before making up enough ground to win. 
He shot a 68 while Payne Stewart had a 74. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lay in the weeds and let everybody else beat themselves,''  
Nicklaus once said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-time U.S. Open champion will be playing his first major  
in a year, and his first with a ceramic left hip. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the beatings will take place around the crowned greens  
known as ``inverted saucers.'' The greens are much smaller than 
they look because the slopes around the edges will send balls 
rolling endlessly into the collection areas. 
</P>
<P>
	That's where the Open may be won -- or lost.  
</P>
<P>
	``I tried almost every club in my bag around the greens,'' Woods  
said after a practice round at Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	If Masters champion Jose Maria Olazabal can keep the ball in  
play, his brilliant short game might give him a chance to become 
the first player since Nicklaus in 1972 to win the Masters and U.S. 
Open in the same year, and the first European to win the U.S. Open 
since Tony Jacklin in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
	Or perhaps this will be the year that Colin Montgomerie, haunted  
by three close calls in the U.S. Open, finally wins his first major 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Montgomerie's strength is his accuracy off the tee, which is  
always important in an Open. He is not lacking in confidence, 
either, particularly after winning the Benson &AMP; Hedges and the 
Volvo PGA Championship, Europe's biggest event. 
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't compare with Woods, who is as hot now as David  
Duval was going into the Masters, when he replaced Woods as the 
world's No. 1 player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little unsettling to see Tiger playing so well,'' Els  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Golf has been craving a showdown between its young stars on the  
grand stage of a major championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval gave himself a chance at Augusta until his Sunday charge  
was derailed by a double bogey. He has been eerily quiet since 
then, but returned after a three-week break to finish tied for 
third in the Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's pretty well known that when you go to the U.S. Open you  
hit in on the fairway and you need to hit on the green,'' Duval 
said. ``So I'm going to figure out a way to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods has returned to the fundamentals with his putting and it's  
starting to pay off. His confidence is building with every round, 
every victory. 
</P>
<P>
	If there's a back-nine duel at Pinehurst, Nicklaus will know  
why. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of unusual, but probably the two best players in the  
game today, Tiger and David, both love to practice their short 
game,'' Nicklaus said. ``And it's paid off for both of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinehurst will require no less of a U.S. Open champion.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Burn Near Grand Canyon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wildfires burned hundreds of acres near the Grand Canyon and  
Whiteriver on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fire charred 800 acres and sent black smoke 20,000 feet into  
the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Elderly members of the Whiteriver-Apache tribe suffered  
breathing problems and several people were evacuated to a high 
school shelter, though exact numbers weren't available, said Jim 
Anderson of the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires burned heavy vegetation, trees and brush about 17  
miles south of Pinetop-Lakeside, about 70 miles east of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	About 600 acres burned near the north rim of the Grand Canyon  
Friday afternoon from a fire that spread slowly after it was 
sparked by lightning on June 3.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson Buys 'Wind' Oscar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Jackson got an Oscar for best motion  
picture today. The film was ``Gone With the Wind,'' and he had to 
pay $1.5 million for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainer phoned in his bid to Sotheby's to purchase the  
statuette awarded to David O. Selznick for the 1939 movie, 
Sotheby's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the auction, the Oscar had been estimated at a value of  
up to only about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sold on Sotheby's auction block Saturday was the film's  
final shooting script, containing the then-controversial line 
spoken by Clark Gable -- ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn'' -- 
Rhett Butler's famous last words to petulant wife Scarlett O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog-eared script, with last-minute changes scribbled on pink  
and cream pages, was sold to an unidentified New York collector for 
$46,000, against a pre-sale estimate of $40,000 to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the orchid percale dress that took Vivien  
Leigh through much of the Civil War movie. She went from clean and 
neat before fleeing the burning Atlanta to dirty and tattered as 
she struggled to support her family at their once-grand estate, 
Tara. 
</P>
<P>
	The dress, one of 27 identical dresses made for the wear and  
tear of filming the movie, went for $90,500 to a Brazilian woman 
who wouldn't give her name to reporters. The costume had a pre-sale 
estimate of $10,000 to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's auction also included memorabilia from the Coney  
Island amusement park, including a 1930s ``kicking mule'' game, 
whose object was to hit a donkey's behind. It drew $2,875. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fascinated by the peculiar brand of carnie and folk  
art,'' said seller Lenny Goodstein, who had traveled with a circus 
in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
	His collection of trophies from the Brooklyn amusement haven  
once known as ``Sodom by the Sea'' included the ``Extraordinary 
bubble blowing clown.'' The huge clown face, fitted with a 
bubble-blowing apparatus, fetched $10,350.

<HEADLINE> Lynx Reintroduced To Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CREEDE, Colo. (AP) -- After an hour of skimming the 14,000-foot  
peaks of the snowy San Juan Mountains, pilot Whitey Wannemacher 
wondered aloud in his small plane: ``Where is everybody today?'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this six-hour mission to track the 37 lynx transplanted here  
from Canada and Alaska, research assistant Chris Parmeter heard 
only four telltale tracking beeps, grabbing his clipboard each time 
to note an animal's location and number. 
</P>
<P>
	In ways, the silence can be heartening, telling the state  
Division of Wildlife workers that the reintroduction of the lynx to 
the mountain wilderness could be paying off with the elusive cats 
dispersing and adapting to their new homes. Faster beeps would 
signal a cat had succumbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they were dead,'' Wannemacher said, ``we'd find them in a  
heartbeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since the controversial reintroduction program began in January,  
trackers have spotted lynx as far as 70 miles from release sites in 
southwestern Colorado. Four of the first five cats starved to 
death, but no dead animals have been found since early April. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths prompted opponents to argue for the program's  
suspension, something wildlife officials say they will consider if 
half the lynx die. In the meantime, they hope to release an 
additional 50 cats next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynx were last spotted in Colorado at Vail in 1973. Weighing up  
to 44 pounds and adept at swimming and tree climbing, their 
distinctive black-tufted ears, short head and large paws 
distinguish them from the bobcat, a relative. 
</P>
<P>
	The trapping and poisoning that contributed to the animals'  
demise in Colorado have been outlawed, but development at the 
state's majestic ski areas continues. The question remains whether 
the cat can exist with resort growth and the proliferation of 
second homes in Colorado's high country. 
</P>
<P>
	Activists have held vigils and accused state biologists of  
rushing to release the lynx to avoid federal protection that might 
interfere with development plans. An eco-terrorist group claimed it 
set a fire last year that caused $12 million damage at Vail to 
protest the resort's expansion. No arrests have been made. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mike Smith, wildlife chairman for the Sierra Club's Colorado  
chapter, defends the state biologists. ``I think the division 
deserves a lot more credit and a lot less hammering,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The biologists say they knew from the start there would be  
losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said the mortality could be 50 percent,'' said Todd  
Malmsbury, a Division of Wildlife spokesman. Just as many lynx can 
starve during some winters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lynx has joined a number of other species that have been  
reintroduced to the wild throughout the West, including condors, 
grizzly bears and wolves. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranchers and farmers have been among those opposed to  
reintroductions, fearing they could bring more federal restrictions 
onto their land. A group of ranchers failed in court to halt 
Colorado's lynx program. 
</P>
<P>
	Reintroduction opponents have found common cause with animal  
rights groups, which said the lynx program was hastily planned and 
that the deaths were unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people who really are upset cannot accept the loss of an  
individual animal,'' said Diane Gansauer, executive director of the 
Colorado Wildlife Federation. ``We have a generation raised to 
believe all is sweetness and light in the bush. Nature's way is 
also very tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, of the Sierra Club, said it is too early to tell whether  
the program will succeed. But he believes it's worth the risk, even 
if some lynx die. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wildlife is a part of our quality of life,'' Smith said. ``If  
I only see lynx tracks in the snow from time to time, it's very 
important me to know they are in Colorado.''

<HEADLINE> Frustrated Sabres Lose Home Ice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres lost the ground they  
gained in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	They didn't like it, and they couldn't explain it.  
</P>
<P>
	``We worked hard but we didn't make the plays that we needed  
to,'' Sabres forward Stu Barnes said Saturday night after the 2-1 
loss to the Dallas Stars in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Stanley Cup finals game at home for the Sabres  
since 1975, when they lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a bad game,'' said Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek,  
whose team credited him with being the biggest factor in the 
Sabres' 3-2 victory in Game 1 in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a couple of power plays in the first period but we  
couldn't score. We had only three or four good scoring chances the 
whole game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres played the kind of winning defense that got them to  
their first Stanley Cup finals in 24 years. But they were smothered 
by Dallas, the league's top defensive team during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their defense was good and we couldn't get any chances,'' said  
Hasek, whose team failed to score on all eight of its power plays 
lasting 14:14 and was outshot 29-12 despite the fact that Dallas 
had only two power plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt pretty confident,'' said Hasek, whose team took a 1-0  
lead on a power-play goal by Barnes 7:51 into the second period 
after a scoreless first. ``We played pretty well in the first 
period.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas countered with goals by Joe Nieuwendyk in the second and  
third. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nieuwendyk had a couple of winning faceoffs,'' Hasek said.  
``After one of them they scored the winning goal. They just 
outplayed us in our zone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's only Game 3,'' Barnes said. ``We have to prove we're  
better in Game 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't seem to have the spark we usually get at home,''  
Sabres defenseman Jay McKee said. ``I can't give you a reason why 
we didn't. We're used to coming out real strong at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres are 3-for-16 in power-play opportunities. It was only  
the second time in 18 playoff games that they didn't score with the 
man advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Dallas had something to do with it.  
</P>
<P>
	``They did a great job blocking shots,'' Sabres forward Dixon  
Ward said. ``We have to do a better job of keeping our energy level 
high. For some reason, we lost that tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Florida Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTE VEDRA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A firecracker buff playing with a  
homemade pipe bomb started a wildfire in northeast Florida last 
year that raged for a week, destroying 20 homes and damaging 18 
others, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Byrd Hill, 47, was charged with igniting the fire that  
raked neighboring Flagler County's Seminole Woods subdivision in 
June 1998, the first in a series of blazes during a catastrophic 
fire season. He was freed Friday on $5,000 bond and faces 
arraignment July 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ponte Vedra Beach man admitted a fascination with  
firecrackers and said he made several 2-inch-long devices from PVC 
pipe, gunpowder and cannon fuses he had around the house, according 
to a state fire marshal's report. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question this was an accidental fire,'' said  
prosecutor John Tanner. ``There is no evidence that he intended any 
harm to anyone. ... However, the mere possession of such a device 
is a crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hill could be sentenced to 30 years in prison if convicted of a  
felony count of using a destructive device resulting in property 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an accident,'' Hill said outside his house Friday. ``I  
don't want anybody to think I'm a bad person.''

<HEADLINE> New Bush WWII Gallery Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Texas (AP) -- The memories weren't all pleasant  
for George Bush as he toured a new museum gallery dedicated to 
World War II battles in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw the island over which my roommate was shot down, the  
first casualty of our squadron,'' said the former president, who 
served as a young pilot during the war. ``Saw the island over which 
I was shot down a year later, a few months later, and a lot in 
between.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush cut the ribbon Friday on the George Bush Gallery of the  
National Museum of the Pacific War, part of the larger Admiral 
Nimitz Museum and Historical Center. The museum is named for World 
War II Pacific fleet commander and Fredericksburg native Admiral 
Chester Nimitz, under whom Bush served. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gallery of exciting exhibits will involve younger  
generations in learning about a part of the 20th century that 
shaped human history like no other major event,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among nearly 1,000 artifacts, the gallery has a corn cob pipe  
that belonged to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, a Japanese air ace's 
goggles and a rusty door salvaged from the USS Arizona at Pearl 
Harbor.

<HEADLINE> Stars' Star Modano May Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Mike Modano, saying he was ``feeling a lot  
better'', indicated he was ready to go in tonight's Stanley Cup 
finals game against the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Dallas Stars' top player also said he would wait to see  
how he felt at game time before making his final decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have the rest of my life to heal,'' the Stars' center said.  
``This is a crucial game and in my gut, I'll probably play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, the Stars' regular-season leading scorer and all-around  
best player, suffered an injury to his left wrist when hit by 
Buffalo's Jay McKee in Game 2 on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano has four assists in his last five playoff games, and  
leads the Stars in playoff assists and takeaways. He is second in 
points, faceoffs and shots and is third in average ice time. 
</P>
<P>
	There was much speculation about the extent of the injury --  
everything from a fractured wrist to strained ligaments. Meeting 
the press this afternoon, Modano came out wearing a short-sleeve 
shirt with no bandage or anything on the wrist that would indicate 
an injury. He kept his arms folded throughout a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano called the injury a ``bad bruise. I jammed it pretty  
good. It's pretty sore. I'll have to have a cast on it to protect 
it (for the game). There will be a little bit of a bull's-eye on 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher warned the Sabres against  
targeting the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they take whacks at it, and end up busting it, I wouldn't  
want to be that guy,'' Hatcher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano said he would meet with a doctor before making his  
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll see what the magic of needles can do,'' Modano said.  
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said the decision was purely up to  
Modano. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's Mike's call, but he knows the parameters of the call  
right now. If he's not 100 per cent, he's not going to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres didn't think Modano's absence would make any  
difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether he's in or out, they're still the best hockey team in  
the league,'' said Dixon Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	The hit on Modano sparked even more verbal sparring between the  
teams in this contentious series. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Modano's injury, Hitchcock said:  
</P>
<P>
	``They go after our best player, we'll go after their best  
player, tit for tat. Their best player is Hasek.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres have their own problems trying to protect Dominik  
Hasek, the award-winning goalie who has become a target in more 
ways than one. The Stars felt they gave him too much space in Game 
1, and were much more aggressive in Game 2 by crashing the net and 
creating traffic in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were very aggressive in front of me,'' Hasek said. ``They  
were falling on me on purpose. They pushed my teammates on me when 
I was down on the ice, which is very dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek is one of the most animated goalies in the NHL, forever  
wandering out of his crease to play the puck like a third 
defenseman. It doesn't matter where it is, either -- in the corners, 
or behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Listening to Hitchcock, it could be open season on goalies the  
rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message isn't to go after Dominik Hasek. The message is on  
loose pucks. They're just as much ours as they are Buffalo's if 
they're up for grabs and if a player is going to interfere, get out 
of the way. Stay in the net, that's what you're paid for and if he 
wants to come out of the net, then pay the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres feel the Stars have played dirty against Hasek,  
taking runs at him. Suddenly, there is a rivalry between a couple 
of teams that only played twice during the regular season and don't 
have much of a history with each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that happens in the playoffs,'' McKee said. ``There is  
some level of hate, and especially when guys are running at Dom ... 
that's going to tick us off a bit ... so it's going to get more 
emotional and physical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost lost in all this verbal cross-fire is the fact that this  
has been a whale of a series so far. The Sabres won the opener 3-2 
in overtime and the Stars won the second game 4-2 in what was a 
one-goal contest until Hatcher scored an empty-netter in the final 
minute.

<HEADLINE> IOC Begins Considering Coles Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- International Olympic Committee  
leaders began considering Sunday whether to expel Australian member 
Phil Coles for alleged ethical misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Eager to resolve the case at the start of week-long Olympic  
meetings in Seoul, the IOC executive board decided to deal with the 
Coles issue on the first day rather than Tuesday as originally 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who has already been censured for his role in the Salt  
Lake City scandal, is under investigation for preparing dossiers of 
private information on fellow IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member investigative panel was submitting a report on  
the Coles case to the IOC board Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel could recommend that the case be dropped or that Coles  
be expelled. Any expulsion would have to go to the full IOC 
assembly for approval. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sydney, Coles expressed confidence he would be cleared.  
</P>
<P>
	He told The Sun-Herald newspaper he expected to reclaim his key  
post on the 2000 Sydney Games organizing committee and the 
Australian Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just be glad when all this business is finally put to  
rest,'' he said. ``I'll have more to say when my name is finally 
cleared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles reiterated his contention that he was the victim of a  
political vendetta in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe my name has been turned into a political football  
and I'm talking of people in high places on both sides of state 
politics,'' Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, who has steadfastly refused pressure to resign, has been  
questioned three times by IOC investigators for alleged abuse of 
his office. 
</P>
<P>
	After appearing last week before a special panel in Lausanne,  
Switzerland, Coles said he was convinced he'd proven his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, a former Olympic rower who has been an IOC member for 17  
years, received a ``most severe warning'' from the IOC in March for 
accepting lavish travel and other incentives from Salt Lake 
bidders. His case was left open amid further allegations of abusing 
his IOC status. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles' ex-wife told the IOC the couple received jewelry valued  
at $6,000 from a businessman associated with the Athens bid for the 
1996 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest investigation centered on more recent allegations  
that Coles had compiled secret dossiers on IOC members for Sydney's 
successful 2000 bid and passed them on to Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	Pal Schmitt, an IOC vice president, has accused Coles of  
breaking ``unwritten ethical rules'' and acting ``against the 
dignity, the pride of IOC members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not how an IOC member should behave,'' Schmitt said.  
</P>
<P>
	But Dick Pound, another IOC vice president and a personal friend  
of Coles, dismissed the dossiers as ``normal chit-chat'' among bid 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's done all the time,'' Pound told The Associated  
Press last week. ``You go at this candidate city business the same 
way. You analyze your electorate, figure out which are more likely 
to vote for you, and how to convince those who are least likely. 
You pass around and share intelligence. I think candidate cities 
even do it among themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials decided to deal with the Coles case early so it  
doesn't overshadow the rest of the week's meetings -- including 
Saturday's selection of the host city for the 2006 Winter Games.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Size Up Knicks As Finals Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Now that the San Antonio Spurs know who  
they'll play in the NBA Finals, they're saying all the right things 
about the team they'll be heavily favored to beat. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks are heading to Texas for the championship  
series, and the Spurs are convinced the Knicks are neither a 
typical eighth-seeded team nor an underdog. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is a team that believes in themselves, and I think  
most everything else comes from that. That is a very together 
group, a very dedicated group. They went and got it done,'' San 
Antonio coach Gregg Popovich said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks advanced into the NBA Finals by defeating Indiana  
90-82 Friday night in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals. New 
York's improbable victory came after Larry Johnson went down with a 
right knee injury and was taken to a hospital, joining Patrick 
Ewing on the sidelines -- at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
	But the fact that the Knicks will be without Ewing and possibly  
Johnson when the finals begin Wednesday at the Alamodome doesn't 
have the top-seeded Spurs taking New York lightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit different, yeah. You think about Patrick, he  
is the Knicks,'' said David Robinson. ``But the focus can't be any 
less. They're playing extremely well. They're playing in the NBA 
Finals. They are a solid, solid basketball team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some Spurs said they hope Johnson returns for the finals.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we win, I don't want to hear all these excuses that all  
these guys have been hurt. Hopefully, L.J. will be all right and be 
able to play Wednesday,'' said guard Mario Elie. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott suggested that injuries can inspire a team.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes a team just gets more focused. They're like, you  
hate to say it, they're like the cornered animal. It makes you real 
nervous,'' Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
	And Avery Johnson said the Knicks seem to get better each time  
they lose a player and joked, ``I hope they don't lose Allan 
Houston next. Then they might sweep us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strong play of Houston, Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby  
have the Spurs preparing for a potentially difficult series against 
that has two players -- Sprewell and Houston -- capable of producing 
30 or more points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Knicks have nothing to lose. They have a lot of talent.  
Spre and Allan could explode,'' Elie said. ``We've got our work cut 
out for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popovich was especially high on Camby, who has emerged during  
the playoffs as a scorer, rebounder and shot blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's in the Rasheed Wallace sort of category. He's got those  
young legs,'' Popovich said. ``He's got that length. He's got a lot 
of different abilities, a lot of ways he can beat you. He's got 
confidence. He's got playing time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio hopes to capitalize on the rest the team has had  
since sweeping Portland 4-0 to win the Western Conference Finals. 
By the time the NBA Finals begin, the Spurs will have been off 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best thing is we had a lot of days off and they didn't,''  
said Tim Duncan. ``They've used up a lot of their energy. 
Hopefully, we can come in here and be energized and be able to wear 
them down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several Spurs couldn't hide their excitement Saturday over  
playing in the NBA Finals in New York, the biggest media market. 
Spurs executives frequently point out San Antonio is the league's 
smallest media market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great thing. When you get a chance to go to the NBA  
Finals then you go to the media capital of the world, that's a 
pretty nice opportunity,'' Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Elie, a New York native, said he's glad to get to go home and  
eat some of his mother's cooking. Elie played in an NBA Finals 
against New York with the Houston Rockets in 1994. He's warning his 
Spurs teammates not to get too caught up in the excitement of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being in New York for a couple of days, it's going to be a  
zoo,'' he said. ``We've got a job at hand to do. We're out there to 
play ball, not to go out there and have fun.''

<HEADLINE>  Russia, NATO Tension Reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Streaming into Kosovo's capital,  
almost unopposed by retreating Serbs, NATO peacekeepers came 
face-to-face Saturday with the Russian troops who beat them to the 
city. A U.S. official said the two sides were running ``a 
coordinated occupation,'' but some reports described tense moments 
between NATO troops and the small Russian force. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid more confusion in Moscow over who decided Friday to send  
the Russian column, U.S. and Russian negotiators worked feverishly 
to design a formal job for Russia in the Kosovo peacekeeping force. 
But there was no immediate result and no sign the column was 
planning to leave, as Russia's foreign minister had promised. 
President Clinton was to talk by telephone Sunday with Russian 
President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The first meeting between British and Russian forces at  
Pristina's airport was ``cordial,'' said Gen. Henry Shelton, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a coordinated occupation right now and the final details  
are going to be worked out,'' Shelton told reporters in Washington, 
adding that there would be 800 NATO troops in the area by 
nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian forces in Kosovo are believed to number 200-300. At  
least 100 additional Russian troops were expected to move soon into 
Kosovo from nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
	A British pool reporter described a tense encounter at the  
airport when Russian forces, supported by Serbs, initially tried to 
bar British forces from the airport. American Apache helicopters 
buzzed overhead and British Challenger I tanks were ordered forward 
in a show of strength, but Serbs blocking the entrance refused to 
back down. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Serbs believe NATO forces will be unwilling or unable to  
save them from revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians, and see Russian 
troops as their protectors. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse at the airport wasn't resolved, the report said,  
until negotiations were convened between the Russian commander, his 
Serb counterpart and British Brigadier Adrian Freer, commander of 
the British 5th Airborne brigade. 
</P>
<P>
	A British Foreign Ministry spokesman, reached for comment in  
London, said the description of the situation ``does not tally with 
anything we are getting through from Pristina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the ministry's information, ``relations between  
British and Russian troops were cordial at worst, and in fact very 
good,'' said the spokesman, speaking on customary condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's SKY news, citing reports from the airport, reported  
that NATO and Russian commanders had reached a deal on sharing the 
runway. 
</P>
<P>
	``The latest we're hearing from the airfield there is that Col.  
Gen. Zavarzin, the Russian commander, has just said they settled 
concrete questions,'' said Chris Bellamy, a defense analyst for the 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	An earlier British pool report said three hours of talks between  
Freer and a one-star Russian general had failed to produce an 
agreement on use of the airport. Freer was quoted as saying overall 
control of the airport was probably in the hands of the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Thunderstorms and heavy hail greeted the British column as it  
reached Pristina's city limits Saturday afternoon after an orderly 
11-hour march north from the Macedonian border. 
</P>
<P>
	The NATO march through the rugged mountain passes from the  
Macedonian border toward Pristina proceeded slowly, but the tempo 
accelerated once reaching flat ground. The convoy moved cautiously 
for fear of mines or Serb snipers, but there were no incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	French tanks, however, were stopped by a minefield along the  
Yugoslav-Macedonian border. A French mine-clearing team was 
dispatched to the area, while 1,200 French infantry were preparing 
to leap-frog over the minefield to fan out into the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Americans and about 200 Germans crossed the border, too,  
and the Italians were to enter Kosovo later Saturday. A larger 
contingent of the expected 8,500 Germans were to march into Kosovo 
from Albania on Sunday, and U.S. Marines were to move in as early 
as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans who crossed into Kosovo included liaison and  
de-mining personnel. There were no specific figures, although the 
Pentagon said it was fewer than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	As the British convoy reached Urosevac, a key town about midway  
between the border and Pristina, about 100 ethnic Albanian 
villagers, waving and chanting ``NATO! NATO!'' briefly blocked the 
road before troops gently asked them to move aside. 
</P>
<P>
	One elderly woman, Zolfia Selime, said she and other villagers  
had been hiding in the mountains while Serb soldiers were in the 
area. ``We're very happy,'' she said. ``God helped us to survive 
until this day that NATO came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serb troops could be seen retreating, some in civilian trucks,  
as the convoy advanced northward. 
</P>
<P>
	British troops disarmed 30 Serb paramilitary militiamen without  
incident. In another confrontation, Yugoslav army officers 
protested that they needed more time to retreat from their 
positions before allowing NATO to proceed, but they eventually 
dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned both NATO and American officials, a  
convoy of Russian soldiers moved into Kosovo's capital about 1 a.m. 
to the crackle of celebratory gunfire, honking horns and thousands 
of cheering Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the troops had arrived  
``unfortunately'' from Bosnia and had been ordered to leave Kosovo. 
But Russian media later said no such orders had been issued. After 
parading through Pristina, the Russians deployed at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	President Yeltsin's top foreign affairs aide, Sergei Prikhodko,  
said on Saturday that Yeltsin himself had given the deployment 
order, but that the timing of the move -- before NATO forces entered 
into Kosovo -- was the decision of the Russian military. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon receiving word of the Russian move toward Pristina, Deputy  
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, en route to the United States, 
returned to Moscow and went immediately into talks with Russian 
officials. The all-night talks adjourned at dawn and reconvened 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been expected to take part in the peacekeeping force,  
but Talbott has failed so far to resolve differences with Moscow 
over who would command the Russians and where they would be based. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian generals have been demanding a separate zone within  
Kosovo under their control. NATO has strongly opposed this, fearing 
creation of a zone where Serbs might still be able to exercise 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin was clearly pleased Saturday by the move into  
Pristina. Yeltsin quickly promoted Lt. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, the 
commander who led the deployment, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100 additional Russian soldiers were preparing Saturday  
in Bosnia to depart for Kosovo, said a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy was being assembled at Bijeljina in the Bosnian Serb  
republic, but it was unclear when the 60-vehicle column would 
depart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been informed by their commander that he would be  
sending a resupply convoy in support of the troops deployed 
yesterday,'' Maj. David Scanlon said. ``We believe they are part of 
the resupply convoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Saturday  
he would appoint Sergio Vieira de Mello to coordinate the civilian 
humanitarian effort in Kosovo.

Pentagon said it was fewer than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
	As the British convoy reached Urosevac, a key town about midway  
between the border and Pristina, about 100 ethnic Albanian 
villagers, waving and chanting ``NATO! NATO!'' briefly blocked the 
road before troops gently asked them to move aside. 
</P>
<P>
	One elderly woman, Zolfia Selime, said she and other villagers  
had been hiding in the mountains while Serb soldiers were in the 
area. ``We're very happy,'' she said. ``God helped us to survive 
until this day that NATO came.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serb troops could be seen retreating, some in civilian trucks,  
as the convoy advanced northward. 
</P>
<P>
	British troops disarmed 30 Serb paramilitary militiamen without  
incident. In another confrontation, Yugoslav army officers 
protested that they needed more time to retreat from their 
positions before allowing NATO to proceed, but they eventually 
dispersed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned both NATO and American officials, a  
convoy of Russian soldiers moved into Kosovo's capital about 1 a.m. 
to the crackle of celebratory gunfire, honking horns and thousands 
of cheering Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the troops had arrived  
``unfortunately'' from Bosnia and had been ordered to leave Kosovo. 
But Russian media later said no such orders had been issued. After 
parading through Pristina, the Russians deployed at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	President Yeltsin's top foreign affairs aide, Sergei Prikhodko,  
said on Saturday that Yeltsin himself had given the deployment 
order, but that the timing of the move -- before NATO forces entered 
into Kosovo -- was the decision of the Russian military. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon receiving word of the Russian move toward Pristina, Deputy  
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, en route to the United States, 
returned to Moscow and went immediately into talks with Russian 
officials. The all-night talks adjourned at dawn and reconvened 
Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been expected to take part in the peacekeeping force,  
but Talbott has failed so far to resolve differences with Moscow 
over who would command the Russians and where they would be based. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian generals have been demanding a separate zone within  
Kosovo under their control. NATO has strongly opposed this, fearing 
creation of a zone where Serbs might still be able to exercise 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kremlin was clearly pleased Saturday by the move into  
Pristina. Yeltsin quickly promoted Lt. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, the 
commander who led the deployment, the ITAR-Tass news agency 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 100 additional Russian soldiers were preparing Saturday  
in Bosnia to depart for Kosovo, said a NATO spokesman in Sarajevo, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
	The convoy was being assembled at Bijeljina in the Bosnian Serb  
republic, but it was unclear when the 60-vehicle column would 
depart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been informed by their commander that he would be  
sending a resupply convoy in support of the troops deployed 
yesterday,'' Maj. David Scanlon said. ``We believe they are part of 
the resupply convoy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan announced Saturday  
he would appoint Sergio Vieira de Mello to coordinate the civilian 
humanitarian effort in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE>  Actor DeForest Kelley Dead at 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- DeForest Kelley, whose portrayal of the  
cantankerous and compassionate Dr. McCoy on the original ``Star 
Trek'' series highlighted an acting career dating to the 1950s, has 
died after a lengthy illness. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley died shortly after noon Friday, said Carol Pfannkuche, a  
spokeswoman for the Motion Picture and Television Country Home and 
Hospital, a retirement facility in suburban Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy was one of the colorful crew of  
23rd-century space travelers that helped make the ``Star Trek'' 
television series a lasting cult favorite. The program aired from 
1966-69 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The verbal sparring and the love-hate relationship between McCoy  
and the coldly logical Mr. Spock provided grist for many of the 
lighthearted moments in the series, its spinoffs and several 
ensuing films. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a country doctor!'' McCoy would exclaim when called  
on to cope with the other-worldly illnesses and calamities that 
beset the USS Enterprise, but he would always come through for his 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bones hardly went an episode without arguing or complaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine -- not to have  
my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget,'' he 
growled in one episode. His exclamations included ``I'm a doctor, 
not a mechanic'' and ``I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``DeForest Kelley was a Southern gentleman all of his life -- a  
kind, good, wonderful friend,'' said William Shatner, who played 
Capt. James Kirk. ``I will miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock: ``He represented  
humanity and it fitted him well. He was a decent, loving, caring 
partner and will be deeply missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jackson DeForest Kelley on Jan. 20, 1920, in Atlanta, he  
played supporting roles in a number of movies, including ``The Man 
in the Gray Flannel Suit'' (1956); ``Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' 
and ``Raintree County'' (1957) and ``Apache Uprising'' (1966). 
</P>
<P>
	He also made appearances on dozens of television shows,  
including ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Bonanza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Trek,'' which was created by Gene Roddenberry, brought  
Kelley out of relative obscurity and into the limelight of popular 
culture. He played the role in six of the ``Star Trek'' films. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley didn't object to being typecast as McCoy.  
</P>
<P>
	``He loved it. He loved that series so much,'' said A.C. Lyles,  
a friend and longtime Paramount Studios producer who knew Kelley 
for five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyles recalled how Kelley went up for a leading role in ``This  
Gun for Hire'' in 1940, losing out to Alan Ladd but gaining a 
Paramount contract and regular roles in Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always used him as a heavy, a mean man, and he was marvelous  
at that,'' Lyles said. In real life, Kelley was known for his great 
sense of humor and a skill at growing roses. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy helped to round out the core characters of the original  
cast -- the macho Kirk, the ever-placid Spock and the spirited 
engineer Scotty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the character he played, he was a very sweet, shy and  
gentle man,'' said George Takei, 62, who played Sulu in the series 
and movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is survived by his wife of nearly 55 years, Carolyn. She  
was hospitalized at the Motion Picture facility with a broken leg 
and had been in the room next to her husband, Lyles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral plans were pending.

<HEADLINE> Student Accused in Deadly Dorm Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MURRAY, Ky. (AP) -- A student rescued by firefighters from a  
burning dormitory last year at Murray State University has been 
charged with setting the blaze, which killed one student and 
injured another. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Walker, 23, of Mayfield, was arrested Friday on charges of  
capital murder, first-degree arson and first-degree assault. 
Walker, a senior, is a former member of a campus security unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonwealth's Attorney Mike Ward refused to comment on a  
possible motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fire was set outside his room. I don't think it was aimed  
at anyone in particular,'' Ward told The Paducah Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Minger, a 19-year-old student, died in the fire that  
broke out Sept. 18, 1998, at Hester Hall. Michael Priddy, another 
student, was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker was rescued from the window of his dorm room by  
firefighters.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Michigan Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- A man who killed a psychiatrist and  
another person before committing suicide in the doctor's office had 
been treated by the doctor a year ago, the physician's daughter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four others were wounded in Friday afternoon's shooting at the  
office of Dr. Reuven Bar-Levav, who died inside his 12th-floor 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were shot at close range with a handgun during  
``some sort of meeting,'' Detective Darrel Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was released from Southfield's Providence Hospital late  
Friday. Two victims were listed in fair condition and another in 
good condition this morning, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the gunman and the other slain person were withheld  
by police. Police have offered no motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears we've got a doctor-patient relationship,'' Police  
Chief Joseph Thomas said. ``We are still trying to determine why it 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Leora Bar-Levav, a psychiatrist who practiced with her  
father, said the gunman had sought help from her father about a 
year ago after reading his book, ``Sinking in the Shadow of 
Feeling.'' The father-daughter team specialized in long-term group 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bar-Levav said the gunman had been hospitalized previously  
and diagnosed elsewhere as a paranoid schizophrenic. He ``could not 
be treated adequately in our outpatient setting,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bar-Levav, who was not in the office during the shootings,  
said witnesses told her the gunman walked into the office and shot 
her father as he stood in the waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
	He then fired several rounds into a room where a group therapy  
session was being held before shooting himself, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups were scheduled to meet at the psychotherapy practice  
at the time of the 5 p.m. shooting. The building was evacuated 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father had a very, very big heart and a lot of dedication  
to the welfare of people everywhere, and a lot of faith in 
people,'' Ms. Bar-Levav said. ``Sometimes, he trusted them too 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bar-Levav, who shifted his practice to suburban Southfield from  
Detroit a few years ago, has written at least two self-published 
books, the last a 1995 effort titled ``Every Family Needs a CEO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the jacket of that book, Bar-Levav was born in 1927  
in Berlin, fled Nazi Germany with his family seven years later and 
went to what now is Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In a posting on his Web site, Bar-Levav said the high school  
shootings in Littleton, Colo., in April underscored the need for 
``more and better gun control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What motivates kids and grown-ups to murder innocents is not  
the presence of guns but the absence of built-in values of right 
and wrong, one of the breeding grounds of blind hate,'' he wrote. 
``This urgently needs to be changed.''

<HEADLINE> NHL Not Yet Planning Women's League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Cammi Granato and Sarah Tueting and their  
teammates had their gold medals, their Wheaties box cover, their 
guest spots on the David Letterman show. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one thing was missing after they returned home to the  
United States last year after winning the Olympic women's ice 
hockey championship. 
</P>
<P>
	A job.  
</P>
<P>
	Most returned to college or to high school, their amateur teams  
and the lives they had before Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the U.S. Olympic women's basketball team, many of  
whom moved on to enticing pro careers following the 1996 Olympics 
in Atlanta, there was no lucrative paycheck awaiting them, no 
chance to cash in on their years of trudging to 6 a.m. practices 
and making tortuously long bus rides to games. 
</P>
<P>
	All they had was a hope that, someday, there might be a women's  
pro hockey league in the United States and Canada like the WNBA. Or 
that they, too, might get a chance to play in men's hockey, as 
goaltender Manon Rheaume did in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd love play hockey and make a living at it. I support a  
women's league -- 100 percent,'' Granato said last year. ``It would 
give little girls another set of role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, that day likely  
won't come soon. 
</P>
<P>
	With the NHL struggling to generate TV ratings and steady some  
of its financially unstable franchises, the league itself is 
fighting to keep its niche among the four major pro sports. 
</P>
<P>
	In the league's first two seasons, WNBA games on NBC had higher  
ratings than the NHL on Fox, even though TV audiences generally are 
much smaller in summer, when the WNBA plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals Tuesday night on Fox drew an  
audience of only 3.7 percent of all homes in the United States with 
television sets, about half the rating for Monday night pro 
wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
	As it tries to maintain its relatively small but intensely loyal  
base of followers and expand its audience to younger fans who might 
be more inclined to watch the X Games on ESPN, there's no room in 
the NHL's world right now for a women's league. 
</P>
<P>
	A league might be created only when a deep-pockets investor,  
such as a cable TV sports venture searching for programming, 
decides to take advantage of NHL rinks that sit mostly empty during 
the summertime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have enough on our plate right now making sure than  
NHL hockey is as strong as it can be before we start leapfrogging 
into other things,'' Bettman said. ``While they may be important, I 
don't want to lose sight of the primary objective, and that is 
building our game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also, women's basketball has a built-in edge over women's hockey  
because millions of school-age girls play the sport either 
competitively or for fun. Few girls have the chance to play hockey 
recreationally because most hockey rinks are booked solid for 
practices and games. 
</P>
<P>
	There are women's leagues in hockey-hungry Canada, but they have  
attracted mostly regional audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a believer in women's hockey, a believer in women's  
sports in general, but in terms of women's hockey having a future, 
I think that is long term in nature,'' Bettman said. ``If there is, 
we would like to be involved with it.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks List Johnson As Day-to-Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The team doctor called it a Grade 2 sprain. The  
team president called it a Grade 1 sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	The severity of Larry Johnson's injury remained somewhat of a  
mystery Saturday, the day after the New York Knicks defeated the 
Indiana Pacers to earn a trip to the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson injured his right knee midway through the second quarter  
when Indiana's Travis Best rolled into it, and he was unable to put 
any weight on it as he was helped off the court and then wheeled to 
an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still listed as day-to-day, he'll receive daily  
treatment,'' team spokeswoman Lori Hamamoto said Saturday. ``He 
won't practice tomorrow, and he'll be reevaluated Monday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the game Friday night, team doctor Norman Scott told  
reporters that Johnson had a Grade 2 sprain, an injury that 
typically takes one to two weeks to recover from. 
</P>
<P>
	But team president Dave Checketts described it as a Grade 1  
sprain, which has a much shorter recovery time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctor called us up in the box and said, you know, I think  
he'll be able to play on Wednesday. Chances are good,'' Checketts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks refused to make Dr. Scott available for interviews  
Saturday. A telephone call to his office was not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was the Knicks' leading scorer against Indiana until he  
was hurt, and New York's chances against the Spurs would be 
severely diminished if Johnson is unable to play. 
</P>
<P>
	The best-of-7 series begins Wednesday night at the Alamodome.

<HEADLINE> Cops in Shooting May Be Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- A lawyer for four white police officers  
involved in the controversial shooting death of a 19-year-old black 
woman says the Police Department is preparing to fire them. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers ``are clearly devastated and frustrated'' with the  
decision, said Bill Hadden, who is representing the officers. He 
told the Press-Enterprise of Riverside that his clients are 
``political scapegoats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting of Tyisha Miller at a gas station last Dec. 28  
prompted complaints of excessive force and racial discrimination. 
After being summoned by a distress call, the officers fired 23 
shots at Miller, hitting her 12 times as she sat in her car outside 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Miller had a gun on her lap and was unresponsive as  
she sat reclined in the driver's seat. One officer said Miller 
reached for the weapon as officers broke the car's driver's side 
window in an effort to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the Riverside County district attorney's office declined  
to file criminal charges against the officers, saying that the 
officers may have made tactical errors but there was no evidence of 
criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Justice and the state attorney general's  
office continue to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Jerry Carroll confirmed an internal affairs  
investigation into the case has been completed. He declined to 
discuss the findings but told The Associated Press he agreed with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll has previously defended the officers' actions, saying  
police sometimes must use deadly force to defend themselves. On 
Friday, he reiterated his support for them not to be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers have been on paid administrative leave.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Roth, a lawyer for Miller's family, questioned the length  
of time taken in preparing the 4,500-page report. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what we know about the case, there's more than enough  
evidence to support a finding that these officers grossly violated 
proper police procedures,'' Roth said. The family has filed a 
federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and several officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some family members were pleased with the report but said it  
does not resolve the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long way from justice, but it's a step forward,'' said  
Miller's aunt, Minerva Butler. ``This is not a celebration. It's 
not even a victory. It's not victory until it's over, when they are 
behind bars.''

<HEADLINE> Modano Plays, Hull Doesn't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dallas got injured Mike Modano back, but  
Brett Hull wasn't around long Saturday night as the Stars beat the 
Buffalo Sabres 2-1 in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, who scored 32 goals during the season and had seven in the  
playoffs, including the game-winner in Thursday night's 4-2 
victory, strained a groin muscle and played only 2:03 of the first 
period. He did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hully got a huge goal for us last game,'' Stars wing Dave Reid  
said. ``We just have to keep pumping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano decided not to let a wrist injury keep him out.  
</P>
<P>
	The center said he felt no pain as he skated a regular shift and  
worked special teams in Dallas' win that gave them a 2-1 lead in 
the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We numbed it up a little bit to take the edge off,'' Modano  
said. ``As long as I don't feel it, it's fine. Just wanted to get 
out there and get a sweat, get involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, injured when he was checked along the boards by Sabres  
defenseman Jay McKee in Game 2, started at left wing with center 
Joe Nieuwendyk and Jere Lehtinen. He ended up skating on a line 
with Lehtinen and Tony Hrkac. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, who called the injury ``a bad bruise,'' would play only  
if he could go full strength, Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players put it best,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's about time  
he feels like the rest of them -- average hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano showed no signs of his injury, logging just over 12  
minutes in the first two periods and winning four of seven 
faceoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He stickhandled with apparent ease and indicated that he would  
be a factor early when he broke away from Sabres defenseman Rhett 
Warrener and went around McKee for two shots, both stopped by 
Dominik Hasek just a minute and a half into the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Had a couple of good shots there early in the first period,  
first shift,'' Modano said. ``So it feels good right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest problems were penalties. Modano took consecutive  
penalties in the second period for tripping and the slashing. Late 
in the period, he negated a Stars power play when he was called for 
interference on Sabres forward Dixon Ward with 37 seconds left in 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano had two assists in the first game against Buffalo for his  
fifth multi-point game of the playoffs. He had four assists in the 
last five playoff games and had a five-game playoff point (3-5-8) 
streak going into Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was tied for second in the playoffs in assists with 13, was  
fourth in points (18) and seventh in faceoff percentage, winning 
just over half.

<HEADLINE> Web Site Lets You Play Star Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Getting your first two million bucks is easy.  
The next step, deciding whether to use it to buy part of Mike 
``Yeah, Baby!'' Myers or the upcoming lusty thriller ``Eyes Wide 
Shut,'' requires a little savvy. 
</P>
<P>
	The online Hollywood Stock Exchange -- www.hsx.com -- is only a  
game. Players trade MovieStocks or StarBonds in celebrities and 
movies the way real investors swap shares of Microsoft or Boeing. 
</P>
<P>
	But with thousands of people playing, the creators of HSX are  
promoting it as a high-tech way for the entertainment industry to 
sample public opinion -- and some studio officials acknowledge that 
they're taking notice. 
</P>
<P>
	With a simple point and click of the mouse, a player can buy a  
bit of Cameron Diaz; her latest movie, ``Any Given Sunday;'' or her 
director, Oliver Stone. MovieStocks or StarBonds are purchased with 
``Hollywood Dollars'' -- designated by the symbol H$ -- the online 
equivalent of ``Monopoly'' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Once you register, for free, your account is credited with H$2  
million to invest in the market. Profits can be exchanged for 
prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the prices of the StarBonds and MovieStocks are based on  
the law of supply and demand among players, an issue's popularity 
could reflect future box-office returns, according to Max Kaiser, a 
former stockbroker who co-founded the Hollywood Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like reading Entertainment Weekly a year in advance,'' he  
said from HSX's Santa Monica headquarters. ``We not only trade 
movies that are in release, we have ones that are in currently in 
production or are just concepts getting kicked around Hollywood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studio heads could tell whether fans are interested in a remake  
of ``Shaft'' or another sequel to ``Jurassic Park'' by checking the 
popularity of their respective stocks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Paddison, an interactive marketing director with New Line  
Cinema, said he monitors response to the studio's ``Austin Powers'' 
sequel and upcoming ``Lord of the Rings'' films on HSX because the 
movies are targeted for the type of 17- to 24-year-old male 
audience the site attracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the buzz was low on HSX would I draft a memo to the studio  
head saying, 'We've got to pull this picture?' No. But I could do 
an advertising buy online,'' Paddison said. 
</P>
<P>
	HSX's online chat rooms carry around-the-clock rumors on casting  
and concepts, and that can boost or break StarBonds and MovieStocks 
depending on whether fans like what they hear. 
</P>
<P>
	When chatter arose that Jim Carrey might appear in a film  
version of the old television series ``Get Smart,'' a flood of 
buyers drove the stock from H$10 per share to H$60. The bubble 
burst and the stock plunged to H$20 after the murmurs proved bogus. 
</P>
<P>
	While fans appear eager to see Carrey walk in Maxwell Smart's  
shoe-phones, they balk at the idea of Leonardo DiCaprio in Darth 
Vader's black boots. The bottom dropped out of the next two ``Star 
Wars'' prequels about the time unconfirmed reports circulated that 
DiCaprio was negotiating to play the 20-something Anakin Skywalker. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders' whims also commonly inflate the market on expected  
blockbusters that flop, triggering setbacks such as the great 
``Godzilla'' crash of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``We lost about 18 billion Hollywood dollars after that  
non-opening,'' Kaiser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar disasters could result when traders flock to  
hyper-anticipated pictures they know little about. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the late Stanley Kubrick's secrecy-shrouded ``Eyes  
Wide Shut'' is trading highly at H$68, but investors could take a 
bath if the on-screen chemistry between married co-stars Nicole 
Kidman and Tom Cruise fizzles. 
</P>
<P>
	And Mike Myers' StarBond is valued at H$2,502 on the chance that  
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' might knock ``Star Wars: 
Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' from atop the box office. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the only genuine key to success on the volatile HSX  
market is a familiar aphorism -- ``buy low, sell high.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton, Mrs.Gore on Their Own </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Seven years after they boarded the  
Clinton-Gore campaign bus together, Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
Tipper Gore are nearing the end of a shared political road, each 
preparing to step out on her own. 
</P>
<P>
	Their interests, tied together by their husbands' campaigns to  
win and then retain the White House, will be diverging in coming 
months. Mrs. Clinton is exploring a U.S. Senate run, and Mrs. Gore 
could succeed Mrs. Clinton as first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday they made the kind of double-barreled appearance that  
has become rarer over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	At a Women for Gore 2000 fund-raiser, they strode onto a stage  
to the strains of ``Don't You Love Her Madly?'' which was nearly 
drowned out by applause. 
</P>
<P>
	They drew standing ovations and hugged when Mrs. Clinton  
introduced the woman who hopes to succeed her in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	They basked in political plugs from California first lady Sharon  
Davis, U.S. Sen. Barbara Boxer and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters. 
</P>
<P>
	They then showered each other with praise.  
</P>
<P>
	``She has been role model for so many of us,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some associates and other observers say the dual appearances  
were bound to taper off. They have become more infrequent over the 
years for Mrs. Gore and Mrs. Clinton, said Marsha Berry, a 
spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'd find that they split up to use resources in different  
parts of they country as much as they could, so it's not often that 
you see them doing fund-raising events together,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, ``they've made a commitment as a team and they remain  
one,'' Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, though she spent part of last week testing the waters  
for her own possible candidacy in New York, Mrs. Clinton flew to 
California to raise money for Gore's presidential bid. Earlier this 
month, both appeared at a Washington, D.C., event to rally women to 
Gore's effort. 
</P>
<P>
	A second appearance in Northern California on Saturday brought  
in donations for the Women's Leadership Forum, a Democratic Party 
arm. Mrs. Gore and Mrs. Clinton addressed the same group in San 
Francisco during their husbands' 1996 re-election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	They found common ground as advocates for children's issues,  
despite their disparate backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Gore set aside a career as a child psychologist to raise  
her four children. Mrs. Clinton, a mother of one, was a partner in 
a prestigious law firm and member of corporate boards. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years ago next month, they barnstormed the country after  
the Democratic National Convention. On Saturday, they recalled the 
hectic 1992 bus tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had that kind of adventure ever since,'' Mrs. Clinton  
said.

<HEADLINE> Summary of Century's Major Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A jostling mob of journalists swarmed the courthouse.  
Photographers snapped away. This murder trial would be ``reported 
to the ends of the civilized globe,'' one paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant was a millionaire. The motive was jealous rage.  
The crime was bloody. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the Trial of the Century -- and it was only 1907.  
</P>
<P>
	The defendant was Harry Thaw (O.J. Simpson would not be born for  
40 years), and the case set a pattern for ``trials of the century'' 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 33 cases have been given that label, according to  
Gerald Uelman, professor of law at Santa Clara University Law 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	American schoolchildren learn the pledge of ``Justice for all,''  
but these cases show how difficult it is to keep that promise. War 
crimes, civil rights abuses, sensational murder and assassinations. 
Even the impeachment of a president. All of these have been placed 
at the doorstep of the law in this century. And not all have 
resulted in fair verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
	The most powerful cases forced society to face fundamental  
quandaries. In the Scopes ``Monkey Trial,'' it was the place of 
religion in public life. The Simpson case presented troubling 
racial questions. Trials like the Lindbergh baby kidnapping and 
Charles Manson's ``Helter Skelter'' killings left us peering into 
the darkness of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
	``The measure of a great trial,'' said defense attorney Leslie  
Abramson, ``should be the impact on society -- cases that advanced 
our state of knowledge and reflected on the problems of the times, 
those that aided in the search for truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie Levenson, associate dean of Loyola Law School in Los  
Angeles, offered another standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``A trial of the century is when the public feels invested in  
the outcome,'' she said. ``They will sit around and talk about it; 
they'll root for one side or the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a look at some of the 20th century's greatest dramas of  
crime and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *'RED VELVET SWING'   	
</P>
<P>
	Harry Thaw, the wastrel heir to a Pittsburgh industrialist's  
fortune, fatally shot society architect Stanford White in the 
middle of the White-designed Madison Square Garden in view of 
hundreds. Thaw's wife, showgirl Evelyn Nesbit, had told her husband 
that White, her former lover, once raped her. 
</P>
<P>
	The first ``trial of the century'' offered salacious views of  
the upper crust. There was testimony about White's red velvet swing 
where he liked to have showgirls swing so he could look underneath 
their dresses. 
</P>
<P>
	Great defenses often make great trials, and Thaw's lawyer,  
Delphin Delmas, had a winner. His client, he said, suffered from 
``Dementia Americana,'' an affliction of the American male whose 
wife's purity is violated. After two trials, Thaw was found 
innocent by reason of insanity and spent the rest of his life in 
and out of insane asylums. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, held in New York, taught the media lessons they would  
not forget about the appeal of courtroom dramas featuring wealth, 
indulgence and sexual decadence. It was the beginning of saturation 
coverage with the new art of photographic reproduction enlivening 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FATTY ARBUCKLE   	
</P>
<P>
	The 1921 trial of Fatty Arbuckle, a comic superstar in the  
fledgling movie industry, focused on loose morals in Hollywood. 
Arbuckle was charged with manslaughter when an actress died after a 
wild party. There were allegations that rape by the overweight 
actor had killed her. Two juries deadlocked and a third acquitted 
Arbuckle, declaring a great injustice had been done. Nonetheless, 
his career was ruined. 
</P>
<P>
	More important, the nation's moral outrage led to creation of  
the movie industry's Hays Office, which censored films for the next 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SACCO AND VANZETTI   	
</P>
<P>
	Rarely has an outpouring of public outrage equaled that at the  
conviction and execution of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian immigrant anarchists, a shoemaker and a fish  
peddler, were charged with committing murder during a $15,000 
payroll robbery in South Braintree, Mass. Many said their political 
views were on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was denounced as prejudiced against them, and the 1921  
trial was called unfair. A Who's Who of intellectuals protested in 
poems, books and paintings. There were general strikes on behalf of 
the men worldwide. American embassies were stoned and one was 
bombed. 
</P>
<P>
	The two went to their deaths declaring their innocence. In 1977,  
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis issued a proclamation clearing 
their names. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCOPES 'MONKEY TRIAL'   	
</P>
<P>
	If great lawyers make great trials, the ``Monkey Trial'' of John  
Thomas Scopes in Dayton, Tenn., in 1925 matched two giants. 
</P>
<P>
	For the defense, Clarence Darrow brought a brilliant mind, a  
fighting spirit and the luster of participation just a year before 
in another ``trial of the century,'' that of Nathan Leopold and 
Richard Loeb in the ``thrill killing'' of a 12-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining the prosecution was none other than populist  
ex-presidential candidate and orator William Jennings Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scopes trial, fictionalized in the drama, ``Inherit The  
Wind,'' involved a young science teacher charged with teaching the 
theory of evolution in violation of a Tennessee law that permitted 
only the Bible's version of divine creation. It was a classic 
battle between fundamentalism and scientific skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, as Darrow badgered Bryan, whom he had called to  
testify as an expert on Scripture, a prosecutor objected: What was 
the purpose of the questioning? 
</P>
<P>
	``The purpose is to cast ridicule on everybody who believes in  
the Bible,'' Bryan snapped, drawing applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Darrow fired back: ``We have the purpose of preventing bigots  
and ignoramuses from controlling the education of the United 
States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scopes' guilty verdict and fine of $100 were later overturned.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE SCOTTSBORO BOYS   	
</P>
<P>
	Racial prejudice was the unspoken topic in the Scottsboro Boys  
trials which stretched over six years, 1931-1937, in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine young black men, the oldest 19 and the youngest 12, were  
charged with raping two white women aboard a train. The women were 
revealed to be prostitutes, and two doctors testified they had not 
been raped. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Communist Party declared the case ``a legal  
lynching.'' Defense lawyer Samuel Liebowitz required National Guard 
protection during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	All defendants were convicted and sentenced to death. The U.S.  
Supreme Court overturned the convictions because blacks were 
excluded from the jury, a landmark decision. Ultimately, four of 
the Scottsboro defendants served prison sentences. The last 
survivor was pardoned at age 64 in 1976 by Alabama Gov. George C. 
Wallace. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LINDBERGH KIDNAPPING   	
</P>
<P>
	The 1935 trial of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, charged with the  
kidnapping and murder of Charles Lindbergh's infant child, was 
``the biggest story since the Resurrection,'' H.L. Mencken wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindbergh electrified the world in 1927 by flying solo from New  
York to Paris . The snatching of his 20-month-old son from his crib 
was every parent's worst nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-year manhunt led authorities to Hauptmann, a German-born  
carpenter. Investigators found $14,500 in ransom money behind 
boards in his garage. Unusual scientific analysis of wood linked 
him to a ladder found below the nursery window. Hauptmann was 
convicted and electrocuted in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial drew one of the largest press corps in history.  
Newsreel cameras were allowed in court for the first time. Tourists 
flocked to the Flemington, N.J., courthouse, and souvenir salesmen 
hawked tiny replicas of the kidnap ladder. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NUREMBERG TRIALS   	
</P>
<P>
	It would become an infamous defense: They were just following  
orders. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two dozen men who helped run Adolf Hitler's Third Reich  
and carry out the Holocaust were brought to the dock in November 
1945. Their war crimes, said Robert H. Jackson, the U.S. Supreme 
Court justice who served as chief prosecutor, were ``so malignant 
... that civilization cannot tolerate their being ignored, because 
it cannot survive their being repeated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some objected that the vanquished in war could not receive a  
fair trial from the victors, but the International Military 
Tribunal went forward in the German city of Nuremberg, where masses 
had once saluted the fuehrer at rallies. The evidence was 
overwhelming and often heartbreaking. At one point, a graphic film 
of the dead in concentration camps sent the judges filing out 
without adjourning. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, all but three defendants were convicted. Ten were  
hanged. Hermann Goering, also sentenced to death, managed to commit 
suicide, as Hitler had done. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROSENBERGS AND THE BOMB   	
</P>
<P>
	The nuclear age and Cold War hysteria converged in the 1951  
trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a case infected by 
anti-Semitism. The Rosenbergs, former Communist Party members, were 
charged with passing secrets of the atom bomb to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	When they were electrocuted in 1953, New York's Union Square  
filled with 10,000 protesters and rallies erupted around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Historians debate their guilt today, and their sons still press  
for their vindication. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SAM SHEPPARD   	
</P>
<P>
	Two trials a decade apart put Sam Sheppard's name in legal  
history books. His sensational 1954 murder case came to symbolize 
pretrial prejudice and the impact of adverse media publicity. 
Attorney F. Lee Bailey gained fame by winning a U.S. Supreme Court 
reversal of Sheppard's conviction in the stabbing murder of his 
wife, Marilyn. 
</P>
<P>
	The saga of the Cleveland osteopath, who won acquittal in 1966,  
inspired the TV series, ``The Fugitive.'' His son recently 
presented new evidence, seeking to prove definitively that his 
father was innocent. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	 *CHICAGO 7   	
</P>
<P>
	Seven protesters were tried together for incitement to riot at  
the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where police 
and opponents of American military involvement in Vietnam battled 
in the streets. The courtroom antics of the defendants and the 
judge, Julius Hoffman, made the trial almost as tumultuous. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman ordered an eighth defendant, Black Panther Bobby Seale,  
bound, gagged and tied to his courtroom chair. He was tried 
separately. Hoffman issued some 200 contempt citations against the 
defendants and most of their attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	The courtroom became a theater of protest as wild-haired  
defendants wore judicial robes to court, then stripped them off and 
stomped on them. 
</P>
<P>
	Five defendants were convicted of inciting to riot, and Seale of  
contempt. All convictions were overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MANSON TRIAL   	
</P>
<P>
	The story of Charles Manson and his band of ``hippie'' followers  
strained credulity. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, no one knew what was behind the 1969 murders of  
actress Sharon Tate and six others in the hills near Hollywood, a 
fearsome spectacle of butchered bodies and bloody scrawlings on 
mansion walls. ``Helter Skelter'' was one chillingly mysterious 
message. 
</P>
<P>
	When Manson's gang was rounded up, terror turned to disbelief. A  
demented cult leader had ordered mass murders on a whim, 
prosecutors said. The 10-month trial revealed a world of 
disaffected young runaways -- remnants of the '60s culture of flower 
power, LSD and sexual anarchy -- who killed on command. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of Manson's ``family'' camped outside the courthouse  
during the 10-month trial. Manson and his three women followers 
carved the letter ``X'' in their foreheads, and once Manson leaped 
at the judge, shouting, ``Someone should cut your head off, old 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson and the women were sentenced to death, later commuted to  
life imprisonment when the death penalty was briefly outlawed. In 
subsequent years, the women expressed remorse. Manson, still in 
prison, was asked on a TV show whether he was crazy. ``Yeah, I'm 
crazy,'' he said. ``But that used to count for something. Now 
everybody's crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	PENTAGON PAPERS   	
</P>
<P>
	The case put the Vietnam War on trial.  
</P>
<P>
	It began when a top military analyst, Daniel Ellsberg,  
disillusioned with American policy, decided to release a 
top-secret, 47-volume Defense Department study of the U.S. role in 
Indochina over three decades. His action was branded by President 
Nixon as treason. 
</P>
<P>
	The government tried to stop publication of the Pentagon Papers,  
first in The New York Times and then in The Washington Post, 
prompting a landmark Supreme Court decision barring prior restraint 
of free expression. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellsberg and his colleague, Anthony Russo, went on trial in 1971  
in Los Angeles, where the papers had been copied. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon authorized unlawful efforts to discredit Ellsberg,  
including a break-in at his psychiatrist's office. Details of the 
burglary opened another Pandora's box of information on the 
emerging Watergate scandal, which eventually toppled Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ultimately, charges against Ellsberg and Russo were dismissed on  
grounds of outrageous governmental misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *O.J. SIMPSON   	
</P>
<P>
	When Simpson, a football hero and pop culture star, was arrested  
for the gruesome stabbings of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, 
and her friend, Ronald Goldman, it was a made-for-TV tragedy from 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson had been a familiar face on screen for years. When he  
fled in a white Bronco, TV cameras followed. His one-year trial was 
televised gavel to gavel. Viewers were transfixed by legal 
procedure and such esoterica as DNA. The subtexts of racial 
prejudice and domestic violence were dissected by a new breed of TV 
personalities -- legal commentators. 
</P>
<P>
	When the trial ended in acquittal many who disagreed chose to  
blame the cameras. A later civil trial, untelevised, resulted in 
Simpson being held liable for the killings. Simpson has 
consistently claimed innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	Did he do it? The answer is left to history.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLINTON IMPEACHMENT TRIAL   	
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's impeachment trial in 1998 was a trial of the  
century with no live witnesses, no traditional rules of evidence, 
no presumptionf innocence or standard of reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a political exercise, but it did have the elements of a  
sensational court case: a celebrity defendant, a beautiful woman, 
illicit sex and power. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Senate's decision not to convict will be argued well  
into the next century. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> CIA Chief Visits Queens Alma Mater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CIA chief George Tenet visited his old high  
school in New York City and let slip a couple of secrets about his 
past. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the biggest mouth in town. Nobody believed I could keep  
a secret,'' he told students and teachers at Benjamin Cardozo High 
School in Queens on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet and his twin brother, William, a cardiologist, were named  
``Alumnus of the Year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to tell you that I've learned my lessons. I'm very very  
discreet now,'' said Tenet, who graduated from the school in 1970 
and was named head of the intelligence agency in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	He credited his high school soccer coach, Ed Tatarian, as an  
important influence whose wisdom still helps him when he's in a jam 
-- and who he says taught him how to run an organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``My high school soccer coach taught me more about how to run a  
big organization of people, as I look back on it, than anybody ever 
taught me for the rest of my life,'' said Tenet. ``He really taught 
me a lot about values, how to conduct yourself, sticking by your 
guns. He was a really giant figure in my life.''

<HEADLINE>  Irvine Leads Formula One Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- As if the Ferraris's weren't fast enough  
already. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Irvine led the way and teammate Michael Schumacher was  
third on Friday in the opening practice sessions for the Canadian 
Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Italian team is introducing a new version of its  
powerful engine in time for today's qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the evolutionary new power plant, Irvine smiled and  
replied: ``It's only a little bit better and a little bit faster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine, third in the points behind Schumacher and defending  
series champion Mika Hakkinen, got around the 2.747-mile, 13-turn 
Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in 1 minute, 20.576 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I only made one mistake and I was pleased with myself until  
then,'' Irvine said, referring to a harmless spin in the afternoon 
session. ``My last lap should have been my best, but I used too 
much of the curb at one point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine's time was .700 seconds quicker than the 1:20.664 by  
McLaren-Mercedes driver David Coulthard of Scotland -- last year's 
Canadian pole-winner -- and .934 seconds faster than Schumacher's 
1:21.276. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, the defending race winner, was very confident after  
Friday's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to the new engine,'' he said. ``I expect  
we will be very competitive in qualifying and in the race, as this 
circuit suits our car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jean Alesi, the 1995 Canada winner, was fourth overall at  
1:21.510 in a Sauber-Petronas, followed by Giancarlo Fisichella's 
Benetton-Playlife at 1:21.724. 
</P>
<P>
	Riccardo Zonta, a 23-year-old Brazilian, made an impressive  
return to action following a three-race layoff while recuperating 
from a broken foot. The youngster put his British American Racing 
entry sixth at 1:21.810, beating out Hakkinen, who struggled to a 
1:21.950 in the other Team McLaren entry. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen, who trails Schumacher by six points in the battle for  
the 1999 series title, does not enjoy racing on the Canadian 
circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This track is just weird,'' the Finnish driver said. ``I've  
never got it right, to be honest. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a challenge. If I get it right, I'll be very  
pleased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even further off pace than Hakkinen was Team Williams driver  
Alex Zanardi, the CART champion each of the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Zanardi, who was an immediate star when he joined the  
American-based series in 1996, has struggled badly so far in his 
return to Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's practice, Zanardi was 18th at 1:23.824.  
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly miss the competitiveness of the car I had  
underneath me last year (in CART),'' the Italian driver said. ``But 
having said that, the Winfield-Williams team is a great 
organization and nobody on the team is happy with the performance 
of the car right now. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still have something to learn about driving the car on these  
grooved tires, which is the feature that has changed the handling 
of the cars most dramatically since I was last in F1 (in 1994).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacques Villeneuve, another former CART champion and Zonta's BAR  
teammate, was ninth at 1:22.021 -- a performance the Canadian-born 
local favorite considered mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're finding some things out to make the car better, but it's  
very difficult,'' Villeneuve said. ``Riccardo's position is 
encouraging for the team as a whole ... so it's looking good.''

<HEADLINE>  Gooden Hits First Homer Since '93 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Dwight Gooden, who had a team-record seven  
homers during his career with the New York Mets, hit a two-run 
homer Friday night against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden, the leading home-run hitter among active pitchers, got  
his first since 1993 and put the Cleveland Indians ahead 3-0 in the 
second inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden set a Mets record with his seventh homer on July 1, 1993,  
off Florida's Charlie Hough. Tom Seaver had held the previous Mets' 
record for homers by a pitcher with six. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooden had a .196 career average when he came to bat Friday  
night and pulled a 2-1 pitch from Steve Parris over the wall in 
left-center for his eighth career homer. Parris angrily yanked off 
his own cap and muttered to himself after the ball cleared the 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
	The homer extended a notable Indians' streak. Their last homer  
by a pitcher also came in Cincinnati, where Dave Burba hit one off 
Scott Klingenbeck last June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Bobby Witt hit the only other homer by a pitcher in  
interleague play.

<HEADLINE> Bank Stops Sharing Customer Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Two days after Minnesota sued U.S. Bank  
for selling customer data to telemarketers, the nation's largest 
bank announced it will stop sharing the information with marketing 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our customers consider the personal and financial information  
we maintain about them highly confidential,'' Ken Lewis, president 
of Bank of America, said Friday. ``This is the right thing to do 
for our customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Attorney General Mike Hatch accused U.S. Bank of  
selling sensitive data ranging from customer names, Social Security 
numbers, birth dates, credit limits, marital status, occupation and 
home ownership status. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America officials said the decision was not prompted by  
the Minnesota lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been looking at re-engineering these processes for four  
or five weeks now,'' said bank spokesman John Cleghorn. ``We 
thought this was the right time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new policy, the bank will not share any customer  
information with marketers who offer their products and services to 
Bank of America customers, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, the bank will not enable telemarketers to  
call its customers offering products unrelated to their financial 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank of America, with $614 billion in assets, has branches in 22  
states and the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> Maine Town May Again Host President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) -- Marine One thundering overhead. The  
presidential motorcade snaking down Ocean Avenue. Noisy critics 
dressed like broccoli spears demonstrating on the Village Green. 
</P>
<P>
	The heady days when Kennebunkport played host to a sitting  
president are becoming a distant memory. Now, former President 
George Bush can play golf or take his boat onto the ocean without 
being in the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
	But the presidential aspirations of a younger Bush, who visits  
this weekend, have residents wondering if the quiet resort town on 
Maine's rocky coast might once again play host to a sitting 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents are generally enthusiastic about Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner. He will spend 
Sunday with his parents at Walker's Point before visiting New 
Hampshire, home of the first presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think the people in Maine are behind him,'' said Dawn  
Patten, who runs Patten's Berry Farm, behind the Cape Arundel Golf 
Club where father and son golf. ``I think the people like him. I'll 
vote with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bushes go way back in Kennebunkport. The three-story,  
stone-and-shingle home at Walker's Point has been in the family 
since the turn of the century, and the former president has spent 
every summer there since boyhood except when he served as a Navy 
aviator in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	George and Barbara Bush have been around long enough to be part  
of the landscape. And they're known as down-to-earth people. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the best part, they aren't hoity-toity,'' said Robert  
Fischer, as he mixed lobster meat and mayonnaise to make lobster 
rolls at Mabel's, a small restaurant where the Bushes often eat. 
</P>
<P>
	The elder Bush is a big fan of Fischer's peanut butter ice cream  
pie, and he buys ice cream by the tub for his grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has a hankering for Patten's fresh-squeezed orange juice  
and has a cold glassful after playing golf at the golf club, where 
he is a fixture when he is in town. He takes time to pose for 
pictures, which are posted in many stores around town. He signed a 
golf ball for one of Patten's workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even people who don't know the Bushes get a friendly wave from  
the former president when he walks by. 
</P>
<P>
	It's no surprise that the warmth shown by George and Barbara  
Bush toward the community is returned to their family. And the 
warmness crosses party lines, even though Republicans outnumber 
Democrats roughly 2-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've met the president and he's a very kindhearted person. It  
would be nice to see the legacy continue both in Kennebunkport and 
the White House,'' said Laura Lee Burke, who works at the desk at 
the Yachtsman, where Bush docks his boat, the Fidelity II. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven years after Bush left office, many residents seem to have  
forgotten the unpleasant, disruptive things like traffic congestion 
and demonstrations. Instead, they remember the good things, like 
the excitement of hosting world leaders such as French President 
Francois Mitterand, British Prime Minister John Major and Jordon's 
King Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	Town Manager Jane Duncan recalls how Mitterand's visit coincided  
with the Masabesic High School senior prom, which was held at the 
same waterfront hotel where he was staying. The students declined 
to cancel their big night but invited him to join them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had the French secret service standing around and kids in  
their tuxedos and prom dresses,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, thoughts of the presidential limelight shining twice  
on Kennebunkport are premature. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if George W. Bush won the Republican Party's nomination and  
then the general election, it's not a sure thing that he would be a 
frequent visitor to Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Texas governor typically visits Walker's Point with  
his family in August, he prefers to go fishing at his own vacation 
home on a lake in eastern Texas, said Mindy Tucker, Bush's campaign 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given his druthers, he'd prefer to be on a lake bass  
fishing,'' Ms. Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	But some still hold out hope of hosting another president, even  
if only occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Shawmut Inn, General Manager Roger Sibley has rented 55  
rooms this weekend to reporters covering George W. Bush. That's 
almost as many rooms as when he used to accommodate the White House 
press corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding as if he had given some thought to another Bush in the  
White House, Sibley noted that the wiring was still in place to

<HEADLINE>  Orioles Bench Belle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *AP Sports Writer	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Baltimore's Albert Belle did not play Friday    	
against the Braves after a shouting match with Orioles manager Ray  
Miller, ending the outfielder's streak of 392 consecutive games 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who was baseball's active leader in consecutive games  
played, was replaced in right field by Jeff Conine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just came in and saw the lineup,'' said Conine, who went  
3-for-5 in Baltimore's 6-2 victory. ``That's all I want to say 
about it. It's a sensitive issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Belle and Miller have declined to comment on the incident,  
which occurred during Wednesday night's 4-2 victory over the 
Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albert Belle just didn't play tonight,'' Miller said. ``That's  
all I've got to say on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he preferred to keep the focus on Sidney Ponson, who  
pitched a five-hitter to beat Greg Maddux and the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to talk about Albert Belle when we just had a  
guy pitch an outstanding game,'' the manager said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller indicated before the game that Belle would return to the  
lineup Saturday, but he wouldn't address the issue after. ``We'll 
see about that when the lineup goes up tomorrow,'' the manager 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle came out on the field to congratulate his teammates after  
the game and, according to Miller, ``He was in the dugout shaking 
hands with everybody the whole game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Belle declined to speak with reporters.  
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who has gone through a disappointing season, failed to  
run out a ground ball in the top of the ninth Wednesday night, 
completing an 0-for-5 game. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the inning, Miller replaced Belle in the  
outfield with Rich Amaral, a move the manager said he planned to 
make before Belle's groundout. But the temperamental slugger was 
unaware of the move until he was on his way to his outfield 
position, eventually jogging back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	In the dugout, TV cameras caught an exchange of profanities  
between Miller and Belle. Belle yelled angrily at Miller and was 
restrained by teammate Jeff Reboulet. Miller waved Belle off with a 
toss of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who signed a $65 million, five-year contract with  
Baltimore in December, has been suspended six times during his 
career and his disdain of the media is well known. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle was hitting only .244 with one home run in his previous 21  
games. The Orioles, with a $78.5 million opening-day payroll, are 
the most disappointing team in baseball with a 22-36 record, and 
there has been speculation that Miller's job is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's Vinny Castilla now has the longest active streak of  
consecutive games -- 304 including Friday night's game at Texas.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Teacher Discusses Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Patricia Nielson can still see the  
teen-age gunmen laughing before they started shooting at teachers 
and students in Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't get it out of my mind,'' she said in an interview  
published in Saturday's Denver Post. ``It's there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nielson, 35, a part-time art teacher and mother of three,  
relayed a terrifying account of the attack to a 911 dispatcher on 
April 20 as Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris went on their rampage. 
Twelve students, one teacher and the gunmen were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 11:20 a.m., Mrs. Nielson was standing in a hallway near  
16-year-old Brian Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	They heard ``pops'' from the stairs outside the building and saw  
a man in black through the double glass doors, but thought at first 
the sounds were from a cap gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just as we got to the second set of doors, (Harris) turned  
around and looked straight at us ... He smiled at me and pointed 
the gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Harris fired, Mrs. Nielson says she spun around and saw a  
bullet hole in the glass door. Anderson was hit in the chest -- he 
was later treated for a superficial wound -- and she felt her back 
burning. A bullet had grazed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know what it was, maybe the glass from the door. The  
second I looked at the kid, (Anderson) he arched and dropped, and I 
screamed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She pushed Anderson back through the doors and they sprinted  
around a corner into the crowded library. 
</P>
<P>
	``Get down. Get under the tables,'' she hollered before grabbing  
a phone and calling police. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I'm a teacher at Columbine High School, and there is a  
student here with a gun ... The school is in a panic, and I'm in 
the library. I've got students down. Kids under the table. My kids 
are screaming,'' Mrs. Nielson told the dispatcher. ``We need police 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I could hear shots, and I could hear bombs,'' she says now.  
``I felt like we were going to die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She whispered to the dispatcher: ``They're in here. They're  
killing kids. I need to go now.'' She left the phone off the hook 
and crawled beneath the desk. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Nielson couldn't see the shooters, but she could hear them.  
</P>
<P>
	They called black teenager Isaiah Shoels a racist name. ``Then  
they killed him,'' she said. The shooters ordered any jocks in the 
room to stand up. Two who were identified were shot. 
</P>
<P>
	When one girl, Cassie Bernall, said ``Oh God, Oh God!'' one of  
the gunmen asked her: ``Do you believe in God?'' When she said she 
did, she was shot, Mrs. Nielson said. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, one of the shooters said: ``Look at that head blow  
up. I didn't know brains could fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shots were fired into the desk where Mrs. Nielson was hiding,  
but she was spared by inches. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the pair walked over -- ``He stopped in front of me, and  
I'm thinking 'I'm dead.''' -- then smashed a chair atop the desk. 
</P>
<P>
	After Klebold and Harris went away, Mrs. Nielson didn't dare  
move although most of the students ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	After several minutes she crawled from behind the desk and hid  
inside a cupboard, while praying and looking in vain for a pencil. 
``I wanted to write down a record of what went on, and I wanted to 
leave my husband a message telling him how much I loved him,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At about 4 p.m., library aides approached the cupboard and told  
her to come out. Police officers pulled her into the hallway, 
ordered her to put her hands behind her head and frisked her. 
</P>
<P>
	She never looked around at the bodies, and didn't know that  
Harris and Klebold were among them.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Michigan Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BINGHAM FARMS, Mich. (AP) -- A psychiatrist who was gunned down  
by a man seeking treatment could have done little to help the 
severely disturbed patient, the doctor's family said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very, very sick,'' said Dr. Ilana Bar-Levav, who  
trained under her father and now practices psychiatry near 
Washington, D.C. ``He needed more inpatient treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Brooks Jr., 27, killed Dr. Reuven Bar-Levav and a woman  
and injured four others before killing himself at Bar-Levav's 
office Friday afternoon. One of the wounded remained hospitalized 
in fair condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have not identified the other victims or provided any  
additional information about the shootings Friday afternoon in 
Bar-Levav's 12th floor office in Southfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman had been diagnosed elsewhere as a paranoid  
schizophrenic and had come to the office several times, said Dr. 
Leora Bar-Levav, who practiced there with her father. The man could 
not be treated because he refused necessary medication and 
hospitalization, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Days before Brooks' rampage, he sent an irrational manuscript to  
Bar-Levav, the psychiatrist with whom Brooks had about a dozen 
psychotherapy sessions last year, the daughter told The Detroit 
News Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was indecipherable, disoriented, disjointed,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Bar-Levav family said Saturday they don't understand what  
sparked the tragedy, but they hope Bar-Levav's research into mental 
stress will stop similar incidents from happening. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton,  
Colo., the 72-year-old Bar-Levav wrote in an article that a return 
to family values and controls on permissiveness were necessary to 
prevent senseless shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	``What motivates kids and grown-ups to murder innocents is not  
the presence of guns but the absence of built-in values of right 
and wrong, one of the breeding grounds of blind hate,'' he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Bar-Levav was the originator of Crisis Mobilization Therapy and  
of A Unified Theory of General Human Motivation and Behavior, both 
dealing with the treatment of emotional stress. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Berlin in 1927, he fled Nazi Germany with his family  
before coming to the United States.

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Cher felt right at home at the new $1.5 billion  
Venetian hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	After taking a gondola ride in canals meandering through posh  
shops at the new resort, the singer-actress said it all looked 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've wanted to see this,'' she said Friday of the resort that  
replicates the landmarks of Venice. ``I've been building a house 
for two years that has a Venetian theme. This is just amazing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cher then scurried back to rehearse for a special VIP concert at  
the Venetian Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert was a warm-up for a 40-city North American tour that  
begins in Phoenix on Wednesday. She plans to begin a European tour 
in September.

<HEADLINE> Wedding 'Contest' Turns Into Love </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A year after David Weinlick held a contest  
for friends and family members to pick a wife for him, he and his 
bride are happily celebrating their first anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinlick and his wife Elizabeth, both 29, say they are surprised  
at how smoothly they adjusted to married life -- especially 
considering they first met about a week before the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would be a lot more difficult,'' Weinlick said.  
The anniversary is Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinlick gained renown when he let 55 of his friends and family  
members choose his bride through a democratic voting process. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth, a student at the University of Minnesota, was chosen  
out of 28 candidates. The two met when Weinlick was courting brides 
at a mall by passing out fliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weinlick said she thought trust and respect were the key to  
marriage, not necessarily romance and love. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I did get married, I pictured it more as a lifetime  
companionship,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But marriage turned out to be more than just two people getting  
along. The pair say they fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
	Weinlick says it happened for him two days after the wedding,  
while the newlyweds were in New York for a TV interview. One night, 
they were pillow-fighting in a hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt this really strong attraction and closeness to  
Elizabeth immediately,'' said Weinlick, a teaching assistant in 
composition at the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weinlick soon felt the same way.  
</P>
<P>
	``We became close very, very quickly,'' she said. ``I have never  
in my life had as much fun with anybody.''

<HEADLINE> FAA To Enforce Pilots' Rest Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government will begin strict enforcement  
of airline flight crew rest rules in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, airline pilots cannot fly more than eight  
hours in a 24-hour period. Pilots also must be able to rest for 
eight hours in that same span. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots claim airlines routinely violate the spirit of the rest  
rules, especially with backup crews. They can be on standby status 
for days without being told when they should rest. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a reserve pilot might get up at 7 a.m. and not be  
told until 8 p.m. of a flight assignment beginning at 10 p.m. The 
pilot might then be expected to complete his allotted eight hours 
of flying time over a 12-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
	In such a case, the pilot would be awake for 27 consecutive  
hours. Within 24 hours, he should have received eight hours of 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, made Friday by the Federal Aviation  
Administration, came less than two weeks after an American Airlines 
jet crashed on landing in Little Rock, Ark., at the end of a long 
day for the two-person flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA officials said last week that the decision was not related  
to the crash and was the result of a breakdown in an attempt to 
reach a consensus on the issue within the aviation community.

<HEADLINE> Experts See Computer Virus Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nervous calls to computer support lines dropped  
off sharply Saturday after two frenzied days of combat against a 
software bug that attacks with the speed of the Melissa virus and 
the destructiveness of the Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer experts, however, feared that the spread of  
Worm.Explore.Zip will pick up again when employees return to work 
Monday, adding to the tens of thousands of machines infected with 
the file-eating bug. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus, first detected June 6 in Israel, did most of its  
damage on Thursday and Friday, infecting computer systems at 
several big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal authorities were investigating the origins of the bug,  
but offered no details of their probe on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Worm.Explore.Zip combines the worst elements of the two viruses  
that swept across the Internet earlier this spring, using e-mail 
trickery similar to Melissa's to overwhelm computer networks and 
attacking computer users individually with the Chernobyl-like 
destruction of their computer files. 
</P>
<P>
	The virus disguises itself as a timely e-mail reply from an  
acquaintance, inviting the recipient to open an attached file that 
sends the virus worming into each computer's hard drive and 
ricocheting around companies connected to that machine by a 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the worst hit was airplane maker Boeing, which was still  
assessing the damage on Saturday. The ``vast majority'' of the 
company's e-mail system was back in operation, said spokesman Dave 
Suffia. Other big names affected included Intel, Microsoft, General 
Electric, AT&AMP;T and Compaq Computer. 
</P>
<P>
	With Melissa and Chernobyl still a fresh memory for most,  
computer systems managers reacted quickly when word of 
Worm.Explore.Zip began to spread by Wednesday, possibly helping 
contain the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	But for computers already affected, there wasn't much optimism  
that lost files would be retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lawyer called Thursday evening and said the virus destroyed  
a bunch of his files. He had to be in court Friday morning and, 
needless to say, he wasn't happy,'' said Barry Raven, a technical 
support analyst for the software maker Network Associates. ``Once 
they're destroyed they're probably not recoverable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-virus workers reported Friday and Saturday that the  
momentum behind this outbreak, though very heavy, seemed to be 
slower than with Melissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Although calling volume was four times heavier than normal on  
Friday at a Network Associates facility in Texas, it was also just 
a quarter as heavy as the volume during the Melissa outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone lines were almost silent Saturday morning at the  
center, dropping off from about 800 customer calls on Friday to 
just a handful by early afternoon Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday we were bombarded, we had calls right up until the  
close, but it's dead right now,'' said Raven, cautioning that the 
sharp dropoff could prove fleeting when people return to work on 
Monday and turn on their computers. ``There are a lot of people who 
don't keep up with the news and haven't found out about (the virus) 
yet, and others who, for one reason or another, decided to wait.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The virus is known to attack only those computers using  
Microsoft operating systems Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows NT. 
Rival operating systems such as Macintosh and Unix apparently are 
not vulnerable.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Hall of Fame Turns 60 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Every time Phil Niekro returns to  
Cooperstown, he makes a beeline for the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love coming back here, especially when your plaque's hanging  
on the wall,'' the former Atlanta Braves knuckleballer said. ``And 
it's still there. I keep checking. You can't help not to. When you 
walk in, you're going to go see if it's still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Niekro returned to Cooperstown again on Saturday, but his plaque  
was an afterthought. The Hall of Fame was marking its 60th 
anniversary, and Niekro was one of the guests of honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a mystique about this town that I've never felt in any  
other little town I've ever been to,'' Niekro said. ``It's a family 
town. It's super-friendly. It's got the lake, it's got the hills, 
it's got the fresh air. It's got everything you want in a little 
town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on this day it had a good old-fashioned parade, with Niekro,  
former Baltimore third baseman Brooks Robinson, and longtime 
Philadelphia Phillie Robin Roberts leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great parade!'' Niekro said. ``The boys and girls and  
the grandmas and grandpas and the balloons, the bands. That was 
probably as good a parade as I've ever been in. There was a smile 
on every face. Every hand was waving. It was like you wanted to go 
sit on the curb and watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty years ago, about 15,000 people, most of them from in and  
around Cooperstown, attended the opening ceremonies of the Hall of 
Fame. On Saturday, a crowd of about 4,000 lined Main Street for the 
festivities. If only Ernie Banks were here -- the day was 
picture-perfect, fit to play two. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big thrill to be here,'' Robinson said. ``The guys  
should come back. I wouldn't miss it. It's part of a tradition. 
It's the greatest hall of fame there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day also carried its share of nostalgia, especially for the  
small group of people known as the 39ers -- those who were here June 
12, 1939 when the doors to the Hall opened for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't sadness,'' recalled Catherine Walker, who was 8  
years old then and now works at the Hall of Fame as attendance 
supervisor. ``Just memories that have gone by. This is a special 
day. Who would have thought way back then as an 8-year-old that I 
would be riding in this parade?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely that any of the first five members -- Babe Ruth, Ty  
Cobb, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson -- would 
recognize the place today. From its humble beginnings in a 
1,200-square-foot building, the Hall of Fame has undergone five 
expansions that have transformed it into a 60,000-square-foot mecca 
for baseball junkies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really something to think of that small building and what  
it's grown into,'' said Homer Osterhoudt, who as a 19-year-old 
worked on the construction of the three-story brick museum. ``This 
is a special day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it was special in 1939, so much so that Ruth came out of  
retirement to play in an all-star game that also included the likes 
of Wagner, Eddie Collins, Charlie Gehringer, Dizzy Dean and Mel 
Ott. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Hall's attraction is its exclusivity -- only 181 of  
the more than 15,000 men who have played the game at its highest 
levels are enshrined. But getting in didn't occupy a lot of 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think any of us ever started out thinking we were  
going to be Hall of Famers,'' Robinson said. ``I certainly knew 
what it was all about. I knew the history of the game and what it 
represented. To be a part of it is absolutely wonderful. It's like 
your own little fraternity.''

<HEADLINE>  Paris Air Show Opens With Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LE BOURGET, France (AP) -- The world's largest air show opened on  
an ominous note Saturday when a prototype of Russia's most advanced 
fighter jet crashed during a flight demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue and white Sukhoi-30 MK had just finished fluttering  
like a leaf in a controlled descent when it appeared to lose power 
coming out of a dive at the 43rd Paris Air Show. 
</P>
<P>
	Two muffled blasts were heard as the plane went down, and black  
smoke billowed from the crash site on the airfield, far from 
spectators. The two pilots ejected from the jet and were not 
seriously injured, the air show's organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the moment we don't know if it's a mechanical incident or  
if he flew too low,'' said Patrick Guerin, an air show spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The twin engine jet crashed hours after French President Jacques  
Chirac inaugurated the eight-day event on a day reserved for the 
news media. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,800 aerospace companies from 40 countries are  
participating in the show, which is held every other year at Le 
Bourget Airport north of Paris. Producers of military aircraft, 
cruise missiles and other state-of-the-art weaponry are exhibiting 
their goods alongside makers of civilian airliners and business 
jets. 
</P>
<P>
	All are vying to sell in a market made increasingly competitive  
by cutbacks in defense spending by cash-strapped governments and a 
weakening demand for passenger planes. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of a concerted sales pitch, F-16 and Eurofighter jets  
looped and corkscrewed through the overcast skies above the 
airfield. Spectators felt their chests shake when pilots gunned the 
engines. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin's C-130J, a ponderous four-engine military  
transport, arced steeply over the tarmac before landing to let the 
Sukhoi take its turn in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's leisurely mood suddenly grew anxious three minutes  
later when the Russian jet crashed. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he tried to recover, he couldn't,'' said Edmond  
Marchegay, the show's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	The last plane to crash at the air show was also Russian -- a  
MiG-29 that went down in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, when you crash in such a way, you are not helping  
your sales and marketing campaign,'' said Oreste Fabbro, a 
marketing manager for the Eurofighter, which is built by a 
consortium of German, Spanish, British and Italian firms. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Bengt Adamsson, a sales executive with Saab AB of  
Sweden, a maker of the delta-wing Gripen fighter, said that 
accidents during test flights are not unusual. The crash of the 
Sukhoi probably would not hurt its sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perspective customers have an awareness of these kinds of  
things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The air show is expected to generate millions of dollars in  
sales, and orders have already started rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolls-Royce said Saturday it had received an order worth up to  
$88 million to supply the engines for Brazil-made Embraer RG-145 
jets ordered by an Italian airline, Al Italia Express.

<HEADLINE> Actor DeForest Kelley Dead at 79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- DeForest Kelley, whose portrayal of the  
cantankerous and compassionate Dr. McCoy on the original ``Star 
Trek'' series highlighted an acting career dating to the 1950s, has 
died after a lengthy illness. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley died shortly after noon Friday, said Carol Pfannkuche, a  
spokeswoman for the Motion Picture and Television Country Home and 
Hospital, a retirement facility in suburban Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Leonard ``Bones'' McCoy was one of the colorful crew of  
23rd-century space travelers that helped make the ``Star Trek'' 
television series a lasting cult favorite. The program aired from 
1966-69 on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The verbal sparring and the love-hate relationship between McCoy  
and the coldly logical Mr. Spock provided grist for many of the 
lighthearted moments in the series, its spinoffs and several 
ensuing films. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just a country doctor!'' McCoy would exclaim when called  
on to cope with the other-worldly illnesses and calamities that 
beset the USS Enterprise, but he would always come through for his 
captain. 
</P>
<P>
	Bones hardly went an episode without arguing or complaining.  
</P>
<P>
	``I signed aboard this ship to practice medicine -- not to have  
my atoms scattered back and forth across space by this gadget,'' he 
growled in one episode. His exclamations included ``I'm a doctor, 
not a mechanic'' and ``I'm a doctor, not a bricklayer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``DeForest Kelley was a Southern gentleman all of his life -- a  
kind, good, wonderful friend,'' said William Shatner, who played 
Capt. James Kirk. ``I will miss him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock: ``He represented  
humanity and it fitted him well. He was a decent, loving, caring 
partner and will be deeply missed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born Jackson DeForest Kelley on Jan. 20, 1920, in Atlanta, he  
played supporting roles in a number of movies, including ``The Man 
in the Gray Flannel Suit'' (1956); ``Gunfight at the O.K. Corral'' 
and ``Raintree County'' (1957) and ``Apache Uprising'' (1966). 
</P>
<P>
	He also made appearances on dozens of television shows,  
including ``Gunsmoke'' and ``Bonanza.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Star Trek,'' which was created by Gene Roddenberry, brought  
Kelley out of relative obscurity and into the limelight of popular 
culture. He played the role in six of the ``Star Trek'' films. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley didn't object to being typecast as McCoy.  
</P>
<P>
	``He loved it. He loved that series so much,'' said A.C. Lyles,  
a friend and longtime Paramount Studios producer who knew Kelley 
for five decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyles recalled how Kelley went up for a leading role in ``This  
Gun for Hire'' in 1940, losing out to Alan Ladd but gaining a 
Paramount contract and regular roles in Westerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always used him as a heavy, a mean man, and he was marvelous  
at that,'' Lyles said. In real life, Kelley was known for his great 
sense of humor and a skill at growing roses. 
</P>
<P>
	McCoy helped to round out the core characters of the original  
cast -- the macho Kirk, the ever-placid Spock and the spirited 
engineer Scotty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite the character he played, he was a very sweet, shy and  
gentle man,'' said George Takei, 62, who played Sulu in the series 
and movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is survived by his wife of nearly 55 years, Carolyn. She  
was hospitalized at the Motion Picture facility with a broken leg 
and had been in the room next to her husband, Lyles said. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral plans were pending.

<HEADLINE>  Baseball Hall of Fame Turns 60 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Every time Phil Niekro returns to  
Cooperstown, he makes a beeline for the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love coming back here, especially when your plaque's hanging  
on the wall,'' the former Atlanta Braves knuckleballer said. ``And 
it's still there. I keep checking. You can't help not to. When you 
walk in, you're going to go see if it's still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Niekro returned to Cooperstown again on Saturday, but his plaque  
was an afterthought. The Hall of Fame was marking its 60th 
anniversary, and Niekro was one of the guests of honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a mystique about this town that I've never felt in any  
other little town I've ever been to,'' Niekro said. ``It's a family 
town. It's super-friendly. It's got the lake, it's got the hills, 
it's got the fresh air. It's got everything you want in a little 
town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on this day it had a good old-fashioned parade, with Niekro,  
former Baltimore third baseman Brooks Robinson, and longtime 
Philadelphia Phillie Robin Roberts leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great parade!'' Niekro said. ``The boys and girls and  
the grandmas and grandpas and the balloons, the bands. That was 
probably as good a parade as I've ever been in. There was a smile 
on every face. Every hand was waving. It was like you wanted to go 
sit on the curb and watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty years ago, about 15,000 people, most of them from in and  
around Cooperstown, attended the opening ceremonies of the Hall of 
Fame. On Saturday, a crowd of about 4,000 lined Main Street for the 
festivities. If only Ernie Banks were here -- the day was 
picture-perfect, fit to play two. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big thrill to be here,'' Robinson said. ``The guys  
should come back. I wouldn't miss it. It's part of a tradition. 
It's the greatest hall of fame there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day also carried its share of nostalgia, especially for the  
small group of people known as the 39ers -- those who were here June 
12, 1939 when the doors to the Hall opened for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't sadness,'' recalled Catherine Walker, who was 8  
years old then and now works at the Hall of Fame as attendance 
supervisor. ``Just memories that have gone by. This is a special 
day. Who would have thought way back then as an 8-year-old that I 
would be riding in this parade?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely that any of the first five members -- Babe Ruth, Ty  
Cobb, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson -- would 
recognize the place today. From its humble beginnings in a 
1,200-square-foot building, the Hall of Fame has undergone five 
expansions that have transformed it into a 60,000-square-foot mecca 
for baseball junkies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really something to think of that small building and what  
it's grown into,'' said Homer Osterhoudt, who as a 19-year-old 
worked on the construction of the three-story brick museum. ``This 
is a special day.''

	And it was special in 1939, so much so that Ruth came out of

<HEADLINE> Indians 4, Reds 3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Charles Nagy won his fifth consecutive start  
and the Cleveland Indians' bullpen narrowly escaped a couple of 
late Cincinnati threats tonight, preserving a 4-3 win over the 
Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Alomar hit his first homer in nearly a month to put the  
Indians ahead to stay and set up their second straight win over 
their intrastate rival. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy (8-3) overcame homers by Greg Vaughn and Eddie Taubensee --  
the only ones he has allowed during the five-game winning streak -- 
then watched the bullpen frustrate the Reds twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Reliever Ricardo Rincon provided the game's most electrifying  
moment when he loaded the bases with a couple of two-out walks in 
the seventh to bring up Sean Casey, hitting .382. 
</P>
<P>
	As fans chanted his last name in unison, Casey -- the first  
baseman who came from Cleveland in a trade last year -- flew out to 
David Justice on the warning track in left field. 
</P>
<P>
	There was another close call in the eighth, when Barry Larkin  
drew a walk from Paul Shuey and stole second and third. Hal Morris' 
sharp grounder up the middle deflected off Shuey's pitching hand to 
Alomar, who threw to first for the final out. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Jackson pitched the ninth for his 13th save in 14 chances.  
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 52,804 was equally divided in loyalties for a  
second consecutive night. Thousands of Indians fans provided the 
Reds with their first regular-season sellout this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Alomar drew an ovation from half of the crowd with a two-run  
homer off Pete Harnisch (5-6) that put the Indians ahead to stay 
4-2 in the fifth inning. It was Alomar's seventh of the season and 
his first since May 14. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians have won four of their five games at Cinergy Field  
in the last two seasons. Harnisch is the only pitcher to stop them 
there, outpitching Nagy for a 2-1 win in the series opener last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagy got the better of the matchup this time, holding the Reds  
to five hits in 6 1-3 innings. Two of the hits were solo homers of 
opposite extremes -- Vaughn hit one into the upper deck in the 
second inning and Taubensee hit one that deflected off the top of 
the wall in the seventh, cutting the lead to 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaughn's 14th homer was only the 27th to reach the upper deck in  
the stadium's 29-year history. The 428-foot shot landed in the 
first section inside the left-field foul screen and ended Nagy's 
streak of 30 2-3 innings without giving up a homer. 
</P>
<P>
	Taubensee's homer in the seventh barely eluded Justice's glove  
and bounced off the top of the wall, extending his hitting streak 
to a career-high 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Harnisch had to leave his start last Sunday in Kansas City after  
only 1 2-3 innings because of a sore shoulder. He seemed fine 
Saturday, striking out seven in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Alomar was ejected in the ninth by Bruce Dreckman for  
arguing ball-and-strike calls. The Indians played the rest of the 
game under protest. ... Jim Thome was out of the Indians' lineup 
Saturday and won't start Sunday. Manager Mike Hargrove is giving 
him some time off to try to help him break out of a slump. Thome 
pinch hit in the ninth and singled to break an 0-for-19 slump. ... 
Nagy struck out in all three at-bats, leaving him 1-for-13 career 
at the plate. ... Reliever Mark Wohlers will start a rehabilitation 
assignment with one of the Reds' minor league teams next week. 
Wohlers is on the DL with anxiety disorder. ... Vaughn also homered 
into the upper deck with San Diego two years ago. He's one of six 
players to hit more than one into the red seats.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Hit With Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A man injured in last week's deadly American  
Airlines crash has filed a lawsuit claiming the airline trained its 
pilots in unsafe cockpit practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Pennington, 44, was aboard American Airlines Flight 1420 on  
June 1 when the plane sped off a runway while landing at the Little 
Rock, Ark., airport and crashed into the steel posts of a catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten people, including Capt. Richard Buschmann, died and more  
than 80 were injured when the plane broke up and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed Friday in a Dallas County district court,  
contends Buschmann and a co-pilot did not follow a landing 
checklist, including failing to arm the landing spoilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit -- which does not specify damages -- blames American  
Airlines and its parent company, AMR Corp., for adopting ``policies 
and practices which were contrary to safe cockpit resource 
management.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines spokesman Chris Chiames said he found it  
``curious'' that lawyers have determined the cause of the accident 
before the National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other lawsuits have been filed regarding the crash,  
including one filed in Little Rock by the family of Debra Sattari 
of Vallejo, Calif., who died in the accident. The lawsuit claims 
the airline was negligent for trying to land the plane in a storm. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors in Chicago and Little Rock also have sued American.

<HEADLINE> Baptists Trying To Broaden Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WAKE FOREST, N.C. (AP) -- The president of the Southern Baptist  
Convention will propose that the denomination broaden its appeal to 
the nation's inner cities by founding multiethnic congregations 
from Boston to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan from Rev. Paige Patterson marks a dramatic shift for a  
denomination whose 16 million members live mostly in the suburbs, 
small towns and rural areas. It is to be presented next week at the 
group's annual meeting in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's desperation in the inner city,'' said Patterson, who  
is also president of Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in 
Wake Forest. ``There are people there who have never experienced 
love and compassion, who don't know where their next meal is coming 
from. We cannot afford, knowing we will stand before God, to 
neglect these masses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson, the architect of the denomination's conservative  
resurgence, will share the stage with Reggie White. The retired 
football legend and ordained Baptist minister is expected to 
address traditional family values. 
</P>
<P>
	The denomination, formed in 1845 by rural whites who insisted on  
their right to own slaves, has never before focused so sharply on 
diversity. Throughout the civil rights era, blacks were not welcome 
in most Southern Baptist churches. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, the denomination apologized to blacks for years  
of tolerating racism. It now has an estimated 2,800 churches with 
mostly black members -- a tiny sliver of the thousands of black 
Baptist churches affiliated with other conventions. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson will propose creating 180 churches in six cities over  
the next three years. Next year, efforts will be focused on Chicago 
and Phoenix. Boston and Las Vegas will follow in 2001, and 
Philadelphia and Seattle in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	In each city, a full-time coordinator will work with volunteers  
in nearby Baptist churches and associations. Initial efforts will 
include Bible studies and prayer groups before a church is founded. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholars say demographics may be one reason for the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``The average white Southern Baptist is 50 years old,'' said  
Bill Leonard, dean of the divinity school at Wake Forest University 
and a Baptist historian. ``They've pretty much saturated the 
suburbs, and they know the fastest-growing population is 
nonwhite.''

<HEADLINE> Switched Babies Case Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- The restraining order obtained by the  
husband of Kimberly Mays Weeks, who was switched at birth and 
became embroiled in a bitter custody battle with two sets of 
parents, has been extended indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weeks married Jeremy Weeks in February 1997. He obtained a  
restraining order June 1, saying his wife had been violent and he 
feared for his safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was in effect until June 14, but the couple reportedly  
wanted to resolve differences and try to win back their 
22-month-old son from state custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers with the state Department of Children &AMP; Families still  
are reviewing a case plan Mrs. Weeks signed -- which is the first 
step in getting her son back. 
</P>
<P>
	Weeks' attorney, Gary Fox, said the couple have not settled  
their differences. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing's changed. They haven't reconciled,'' Fox said. ``As  
far as I know, he's going to file for divorce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his request for the order, Weeks, 21, said his wife was ``out  
of control'' and had hit and slapped him, waved knives, and been 
verbally abusive. The court order bars Mrs. Weeks, 20, from the 
couple's home and her husband's workplace and from the home of his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weeks' life story was nationally reported when it was  
discovered in 1988 that she and another girl went home from a 
hospital with the wrong families. 
</P>
<P>
	After the other child, Arlena Twigg, died of heart disease, her  
family and Robert Mays, who had raised Weeks, battled over custody 
for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Weeks' lawyer Diana Tennis said Mrs. Weeks wants the  
relationship with her husband to be as close as possible, and is 
committed to getting their son back.

<HEADLINE> Twins' Hawkins Leaves Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Minnesota's LaTroy Hawkins was hit by a hard  
one-hopper from Jeromy Burnitz in the first inning and had to leave 
the Twins' game against the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Twins ahead 1-0, Jeff Cirillo singled with two outs in  
the bottom of the first. Burnitz followed with a wicked shot which 
nailed Hawkins just below the knee cap on his left leg. Cirillo 
advanced to third as the balled rolled toward the Brewers' dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins took a few steps toward first, but then fell to the  
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Benj Sampson relieved Hawkins who limped off the field with help  
from manager Tom Kelly and the trainer.

<HEADLINE> Wohlers Headed to Minors Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Reliever Mark Wohlers is headed to the  
Cincinnati Reds' minor leagues again to see if he can throw strikes 
in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Wohlers threw batting practice to teammates again Saturday and  
did well enough to let the Reds approve his next step. He'll report 
to one of their minor league teams in the next week to start a 
rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm ready,'' Wohlers said. ``I'm excited with the way I'm  
throwing the ball. Now it's time to start applying what I've worked 
on over the last couple of months in game situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds got Wohlers from Atlanta in a trade for John Hudek on  
April 16 and put him on the disabled list with anxiety disorder. 
Essentially, he lost the ability to throw strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	After working out with pitching coach Don Gullett for two weeks,  
Wohlers was eager to start a rehabilitation assignment with 
Triple-A Indianapolis. It couldn't have gone much worse -- he walked 
five of the seven batters he faced and threw four wild pitches 
against Toledo on May 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, he's been working out with Gullett and trying to fix  
flaws in his delivery by throwing batting practice to teammates. 
This time, he thinks he's ready to throw in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be good to get in there without the batting cage and  
with an umpire,'' he said. ``I never liked pitching batting 
practice anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gullett thinks Wohlers is ready, too.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's a matter of facing hitters and making the  
adjustments,'' Gullett said. ``I think he's a little tentative with 
his teammates in there. The real test is going to be against 
opposing hitters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds initially intended to send Wohlers to their rookie team  
in Sarasota, but later learned they couldn't do so. They weren't 
sure Saturday which team he would join. 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds would like to start him in the lower minors and  
eventually move him up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's best to have him go against hitters at the lowest  
level and with the least amount of pressure before we start to 
elevate him,'' general manager Jim Bowden said.

<HEADLINE> Three Killed in Michigan Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTHFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- A man who killed a psychiatrist and  
another person before committing suicide in the doctor's office had 
been treated by the doctor a year ago, the physician's daughter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four others were wounded in Friday afternoon's shooting at the  
office of Dr. Reuven Bar-Levav, who died inside his 12th-floor 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims were shot at close range with a handgun during  
``some sort of meeting,'' Detective Darrel Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was released from Southfield's Providence Hospital late  
Friday. Two victims were listed in fair condition and another in 
good condition this morning, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The name of the gunman and the other slain person were withheld  
by police. Police have offered no motive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears we've got a doctor-patient relationship,'' Police  
Chief Joseph Thomas said. ``We are still trying to determine why it 
happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Leora Bar-Levav, a psychiatrist who practiced with her  
father, said the gunman had sought help from her father about a 
year ago after reading his book, ``Sinking in the Shadow of 
Feeling.'' The father-daughter team specialized in long-term group 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bar-Levav said the gunman had been hospitalized previously  
and diagnosed elsewhere as a paranoid schizophrenic. He ``could not 
be treated adequately in our outpatient setting,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bar-Levav, who was not in the office during the shootings,  
said witnesses told her the gunman walked into the office and shot 
her father as he stood in the waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
	He then fired several rounds into a room where a group therapy  
session was being held before shooting himself, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups were scheduled to meet at the psychotherapy practice  
at the time of the 5 p.m. shooting. The building was evacuated 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father had a very, very big heart and a lot of dedication  
to the welfare of people everywhere, and a lot of faith in 
people,'' Ms. Bar-Levav said. ``Sometimes, he trusted them too 
much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bar-Levav, who shifted his practice to suburban Southfield from  
Detroit a few years ago, has written at least two self-published 
books, the last a 1995 effort titled ``Every Family Needs a CEO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the jacket of that book, Bar-Levav was born in 1927  
in Berlin, fled Nazi Germany with his family seven years later and 
went to what now is Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	In a posting on his Web site, Bar-Levav said the high school  
shootings in Littleton, Colo., in April underscored the need for 
``more and better gun control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What motivates kids and grown-ups to murder innocents is not  
the presence of guns but the absence of built-in values of right 
and wrong, one of the breeding grounds of blind hate,'' he wrote. 
``This urgently needs to be changed.''

<HEADLINE> NYC's Safir May Pay for Oscar Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Police Commissioner Howard Safir has reportedly  
agreed to reimburse a Revlon executive $7,000 for an 
all-expenses-paid trip to the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
	A city investigation cleared Safir of any wrongdoing but  
recommended that he repay the money to avoid any hint of 
impropriety, the Daily News reported Friday, citing an unidentified 
source. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir came under fire after he and his wife flew to Los Angeles  
for the Oscars on March 21 aboard a corporate jet chartered by 
Revlon president and chief executive George Fellows. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Rudolph Giuliani defended Safir, and the commissioner said  
he did not believe he broke any rules because Revlon does not do 
business with the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip came under more scrutiny after Safir initially said  
that because of a ``scheduling conflict,'' he would miss a City 
Council hearing about the police shooting of an unarmed African 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
	After being spotted on TV walking down the red carpet at the  
Oscars ceremony -- near actress Helen Hunt -- Safir took a red-eye 
flight back to New York and testified at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Safir's spokeswoman, Marilyn Mode, had no comment Friday on  
whether he would reimburse Fellows.

<HEADLINE> Louisiana GOP Wants First Caucus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALEXANDRIA, La. (AP) -- Louisiana's Republican leaders decided  
today to hold a 2000 presidential caucus one week ahead of Iowa's 
traditional first-in-the-nation caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	But the question of whether the Republican National Committee  
would recognize the caucus was not addressed by the 160 Republicans 
who gathered for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the members of the Louisiana GOP spent much of the time  
arguing over and eventually rejecting a competing proposal for 
Louisiana to hold the country's first-ever presidential primary 
with Internet voting. 
</P>
<P>
	It was defeated after dozens of Internet-balloting supporters  
walked out in a protest. They said they would file a lawsuit to 
reverse the caucus vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Benham, assistant executive director of the state party,  
had said Friday that the Republican National Committee wants all 
delegates selected on or after Feb. 7 -- the tentative date for 
Iowa's caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for the Louisiana caucus did not specify a date but  
said it would be held a week before Iowa's caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Louisiana held a caucus before Iowa's caucus, but most  
candidates shunned Louisiana because they worried about offending 
Iowa Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidate Gary Bauer, former head of the Family Research  
Council, predicted the RNC will recognize the Louisiana caucus. He 
said party officials would work out problems, and that candidates 
would have enough time to campaign in both states. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think that's a decent enough interval that it won't  
cause too many problems,'' he said. ``I was just in Iowa the other 
day and folks seemed comfortable with the role Louisiana has 
taken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Francis, Louisiana's Republican Party chairman, said seven  
candidates have indicated they would participate in a Louisiana 
caucus in 2000. The only candidates he named were New Hampshire 
Sen. Bob Smith, Bauer and publisher Steve Forbes. Conservative 
columnist Pat Buchanan has already announced he would participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign officials for the man considered by many to be the  
front-runner for the Republican nomination, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, could not immediately be reached for comment on the Louisiana 
caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Louisiana event is being called a caucus, it will  
function much like a primary. Registered Republicans will cast 
ballots at 100 voting stations in the state's 64 parishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Polling places will be open for eight hours. In 1996, they were  
open only four hours -- a situation that created long lines. And the 
caucus was also criticized for low turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20,000 Louisiana Republicans voted at 42 precincts in  
1996. In contrast, Iowa's caucus drew about 100,000 voters to 2,000 
sites

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us Makes Improvements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- While shoddy customer service is a problem at  
many businesses, Toys R Us has been cited as one of the worst. 
</P>
<P>
	In an acknowledgment of its troubles, the Paramus, N.J.-based  
company plans to launch its biggest customer service overhaul ever 
Sunday. The initiative is intended to rally Toys R Us' 52,000 U.S. 
employees to change how they treat customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can lose a customer very fast, but you can win them back  
and part of that comes with great service,'' says Toys R Us chief 
executive Robert Nakasone. ``It doesn't cost any more to smile or 
be polite to a customer, and there's a huge payoff if they come 
back to the store again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a tough few years for Toys R Us, and its problems --  
including sluggish sales and profits -- have been linked in part to 
poor service. Shoppers complain of cramped aisles, confusing 
layouts and apathetic salespeople who seem unable to distinguish 
Barbie dolls from baseball bats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate shopping at a store where the sales help literally  
barks at you if you have a question or need help finding 
something,'' says Jenny Wong, a New York mother of two who thinks 
of Toys R Us when asked about stores she really detests. 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart dethroned Toys R Us as the nation's biggest retailer in  
1998. Wal-Mart and other discount chains are stealing away 
customers by selling toys for less and doing it with friendlier and 
more attentive service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toys R Us allowed its stores to get tired, it allowed its  
service to get tired and that can't happen in any kind of 
retailing, but especially toy retailing,'' says Leonard Barry, a 
professor of retailing at Texas A&AMP;M University and author of 
``Discovering the Soul of Service.'' ``Toy stores are supposed to 
be a happy experience and selling today to the customer should be 
fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last year, Toys R Us has started a major renovation of  
its 1,500 stores, developing a brighter, easier-to-navigate layout. 
The company has also added more products that kids today want, such 
as electronics, science and learning toys and beauty accessories. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us is also stepping up its presence on the Internet, and  
later this month, is expected to unveil a new Web site that is 
easier to use. 
</P>
<P>
	But many analysts say the most crucial step in winning shoppers  
back is improving customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday night, every Toys R Us employee in the country will  
participate in a three-hour presentation and cheerleading session. 
The program will highlight the importance of courtesy and 
approaching the customer before the customer asks for help. 
</P>
<P>
	In the coming year, workers who never before got specialized  
training will be assigned a section of the store and taught about 
the toys there. 
</P>
<P>
	The program was designed with the help of the Disney Institute,  
which teaches corporations how to emulate the Magic Kingdom's 
customer service success. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Wong says the new program may prompt her to give Toys R Us  
another chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's see what happens next Christmas,'' she says. ``If they  
are nice then, I'll admit the program is working.''

<HEADLINE> Grant Finds Star Status 'Traumatic' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After taking nearly three years off, Hugh Grant  
is back with two romantic comedies -- and still complaining about 
the stress of being a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone came up to me today and said, `Hugh, a law has just  
been passed that you can't act anymore,' I'd be cracking open the 
champagne,'' Grant says in the July issue of US magazine. ``The 
older I get, the more traumatic I find it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant costars in ``Notting Hill'' opposite Julia Roberts and in  
the upcoming ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' with Jeanne Tripplehorn. He's 
also helping produce films with longtime girlfriend Elizabeth 
Hurley. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite their dignified British demeanors, Hurley says the  
couple is a fiery match. 
</P>
<P>
	``We both have lightning mood swings and within seconds go from  
shrieking and yelling and throwing things to laughing hysterically 
and sitting on each other's lap,'' Hurley said.

<HEADLINE> Cycling Champ Accused of Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- A German news magazine accused the  
cycling team of 1997 Tour de France winner Jan Ullrich of 
systematically using blood doping and other performance-enhancing 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ullrich himself had an unusually high red blood-cell count  
shortly after his tour victory, Der Spiegel magazine reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In an account released today in advance of the magazine's  
publication Monday, Spiegel said its article was based on training 
documents and statements made by unnamed former Team Deutsche 
Telekom aides. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to former members of the team, doping is used by  
Team Telekom precisely as systematically and comprehensively as it 
is by competing teams -- except that no one has been caught yet,'' 
Spiegel wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Spiegel said Telekom riders used EPO, steroids and growth  
hormones, provided and administered by the various support staff on 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	At a one-day race shortly after he won the 1997 Tour de France,  
Ullrich had a red blood-cell count ``way over'' 50, the allowed 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Ullrich did not stay in the team hotel to escape  
possible drug tests by the International Cycling Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Juergen Kindervater, spokesman for Deutsche Telekom AG, the  
sponsor of the team, denied Spiegel's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole article is a conglomeration of allegations. They are  
insinuations and conjectures,'' Kindervater said. 
</P>
<P>
	The spokesman said he had proof that Spiegel had been engaged in  
``checkbook journalism'' for several months, trying to ``bribe'' 
former team staffers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kindervater said the team underwent 180 drug tests a year.  
</P>
<P>
	Spiegel's allegations come three weeks before this year's Tour  
de France, and one week after the banning of Marco Pantani, last 
year's Tour winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantani also had an unusually high red blood-cell count before a  
stage of the Tour of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	A high count can occur naturally, but can also indicate the use  
of a synthetic form of the hormone EPO. 
</P>
<P>
	EPO, or erythropoietin, allows users to cram oxygen into the  
blood, enhancing their performance levels. It also has been linked 
to the deaths of about 20 cyclists since the late 1980s.

<HEADLINE> L.A.'s Subway Extends to Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The 4.6-mile Hollywood extension of the  
city's new subway opened today to huge crowds eager to test the new 
experience of getting around by underground rail instead of by car 
and bus. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 105,000 people rode at least a portion of the  
11.1-mile Metro Rail Red Line route that includes the new segment, 
said Ed Scannell, a spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first time on a subway,'' said Marcial San Pedro, a  
retiree riding with his wife, Aida, on a Metro Rail Red Line train 
rolling to a new station under the intersection of Hollywood 
Boulevard and Vine Street. ``This is my wife's first time too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rides on the Red Line were free all weekend, and the  
Metropolitan Transportation Authority provided entertainment at 
each of the five new stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The premiere of the Hollywood segment marked a major step for  
the much-criticized, over-budget and behind-schedule subway. Until 
Saturday, the Red Line ran just a little over six miles, from Union 
Station across downtown and a short distance to the west. 
</P>
<P>
	Now linking two distinct destinations, the subway drew crowds  
that gave it the bustling appearance of metropolitan underground 
systems elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfonso Rodriquez, MTA deputy executive officer and project  
manager of the Hollywood extension, said weekday Red Line passenger 
counts are expected to double now. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now we have 39,000 people boarding daily,'' he said.  
``With this extension, we expect it to go to nearly 80,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 4.6-mile segment, which was supposed to open last December,  
and a smaller addition that was already in service cost $1.74 
billion, about $288 million over budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, the Red Line will continue on from Hollywood to  
Universal City, then drop down into the San Fernando Valley. Its 
total length will be 17.4 miles.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Wildfire Scorches 5,000 Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fire crews in Arizona were nearing containment today of a  
4,470-acre wildfire that has forced 100 people from their homes on 
the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 firefighters formed a preliminary containment line  
this morning that has stopped the spread of the fire, U.S. Forest 
Service spokesman Bob Dyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added: ``When the winds come up today, we're  
anticipating spot fires across the line. Every ember that we've got 
is burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which was sparked Friday, has charred 4,470 acres of  
pine trees and heavy brush north of the town of Whiteriver, about 
130 miles northeast of Phoenix. Twelve buildings, including some 
homes, have been destroyed, Dyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 100 evacuees were staying in two shelters in Whiteriver.  
Officials were worried that heavy smoke could cause breathing 
problems for some people, including the elderly, Dyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sucking lots of smoke in all the valleys,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a wildfire ignited by lightning on June 3 had burned  
600 acres of Ponderosa pine near the north rim of the Grand Canyon 
by late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the fire had spread slowly to a mile east of the  
Mount Logan Wilderness Area but would be allowed to burn itself 
out.

<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In the first minute of his first  
campaign trip, George W. Bush grabbed the microphone aboard his 
``Great Expectations'' campaign plane and did his best imitation of 
a steward. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is your candidate, George W. Bush. Welcome aboard the  
inaugural flight of Great Expectations,'' he said, drawing polite 
laughter from his audience: Nearly 100 reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please store your expectations securely in your overhead bins,  
as they may shift during the trip and may fall and hurt someone -- 
especially me,'' Bush continued, reading from notes prepared by his 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a lighthearted way for the Texas governor to say, Give me  
a break. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading in polls, money raising and endorsements, Bush knows  
there is little chance that he can meet the expectations set for 
his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We ask for your indulgence and seek your personal  
understanding that while you are traveling with a well-trained 
crew, for many of us this is our first solo flight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The son of former President George Bush was referring to himself  
and his staff, not the flight crew. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The day went rather smoothly for Bush, with little turbulence.  
</P>
<P>
	He did, however, nearly trip up -- coming close to showing a lack  
of knowledge about Iowa mainstays when he visited a charity 
clothing center in Cedar Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
	Squinting at a sign on the wall, Bush read it out loud: ``This  
is my Yon ... Younkers?'' He looked at a local resident for help. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a retail outlet here, sir,'' a woman told him. A rather  
well-known one. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	His blue dress shirt soaked through with sweat, Bush spotted a  
baby in a crowd of 2,000 at one of his speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK,'' he said, realizing it was time for the typical campaign  
photo. ``Here we go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He gently took the 10-month old, Aaron Worf, from his mother and  
turned toward photographers. The doe-eyed baby didn't mind at first 
but suddenly broke into tears. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush teased one of the photographers. ``He took one look at  
you'' and cried, the governor said with a smile. ``It couldn't have 
been me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The photographer said he would take responsibility. ``This is  
the responsibility era,'' Bush said, using one of his campaign 
slogans to get another laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's mother, Donna, said she was impressed nonetheless.  
</P>
<P>
	``The man has charisma,'' he said. ``He makes people want to  
work for him and vote for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Dole, meanwhile, was clearly getting the most  
attention of the GOP presidential rivals who showed up at the World 
Pork Expo on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	After she delivered her speech and headed to a nearby tent for a  
news conference and autograph session about half the crowd of 400 
left with her, not good news for the contenders who followed her to 
the podium. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not comparing, I'm not looking at, I'm not being  
distracted by anything that other candidates are doing, even Lamar 
Alexander speaking as I'm speaking right now,'' Mrs. Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other rivals shrugged it off, including Ohio Rep. John Kasich.  
</P>
<P>
	``He said he's used to talking to an empty house -- he's a  
congressman,'' quipped one event organizer. 
</P>
<P>
	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in Iowa can get a bit chummy, as Mrs. Dole already  
knows and Bush will surely learn. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor and former Cabinet secretary both scheduled  
stops in Des Moines and in Cedar Rapids at different times of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	The two intersected briefly at the Cedar Rapids airport, where  
their respective campaign airplanes were parked next to each other 
on the tarmac. Mrs. Dole showed up to fly to California but took 
time to chat with some Bush aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Ari Fleischer, an aide to Mrs. Dole, was seen giving a big hug  
to Mindy Tucker, his counterpart with Bush. Bush was in a holding 
room in a nearby hangar during the encounter and the two candidates 
didn't meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said Bush had planned to say hello to Mrs. Dole. ``I wish  
it would have happened,''' Fliescher said. ``It would have been a 
wonderful moment.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Ex-Boxer $10.7M in Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The actual fight lasted just 70 seconds.  
The legal battle took several years. And Randall ``Tex'' Cobb won a 
$10.7 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury on Friday ordered Time Inc. to pay $10.7 million to  
ex-heavyweight boxer for a 1993 Sports Illustrated article that 
said he fixed a fight and shared cocaine with the loser. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tex has been a prisoner of this article for six years and  
there's no better feeling in the world than to have a jury come in 
and set the record straight,'' attorney George Bochetto said. 
``This jury set this man free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, 46, said the story headlined ``The Fix Was In'' ended his  
boxing career and nearly sidelined his acting pursuits. The jury 
deliberated about four hours before awarding him $2.2 million in 
punitive damages on top of the $8.5 million in compensatory damages 
it awarded Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The article described the 1992 bout between Cobb and Sonny  
Barch, a journeyman fighter and former Memphis State football 
player. The magazine said Cobb and Barch discussed how to throw the 
fight, with Cobb complaining of an injured shoulder and hoping to 
end the match quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	In the article, Barch said he told Cobb: ``I'm going to have to  
hit you to make it look good. But I won't hit your shoulder.'' 
Barch said that Cobb responded: ``Bubba, I appreciate it. I'll make 
it up to you,'' according to the article. 
</P>
<P>
	Barch allowed Cobb to hit him three times, dropping to a knee  
each time and triggering the three-knockdown rule, Sports 
Illustrated reported. Cobb was declared the winner by technical 
knockout 70 seconds into the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The magazine also reported that Barch said he, Cobb and a fight  
promoter shared cocaine after the bout. Sports Illustrated reported 
that both Barch and Cobb had flunked post-fight drug tests and the 
fight was declared a no-contest. In a follow-up, Sports Illustrated 
said that Cobb had tested positive for marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Juror Steve Reynolds, a Nashville schoolteacher, said the story  
was unfair, slanted and ``based on a shady individual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Robinson, managing editor of CNN-SI and a former Sports  
Illustrated senior editor who worked on the story, said the verdict 
``shocked us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our position is the story is accurate. The jury findings are  
not supported by the evidence,'' he said. ``We're very confident we 
will prevail on appeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cobb, a former Nashville resident who now lives in Philadelphia,  
has had roles in several movies, including ``Liar, Liar,'' 
``Raising Arizona,'' ``Uncommon Valor'' and ``The Golden Child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $2.2 million in punitive damages is approximately how much  
Sports Illustrated made in net income per issue last year, 
according to testimony. Sports Illustrated, a subsidiary of Time 
Inc., published 52 issues last year and reported earnings of more 
than $112 million.

<HEADLINE> Senators Disclose Financial Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators are not only legislating the future  
of cyberspace, they're also investing their personal money in such 
lucrative high-tech companies as America Online and Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a dozen senators reported buying or holding stock in  
high-tech companies in amounts ranging from as little as $1,000 to 
as much as $1 million, according to disclosure reports released 
Friday that detailed their personal finances in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The forms provide a glimpse into the assets, liabilities and  
outside earnings of senators -- many of whom are millionaires -- but 
describe figures in broad ranges. House members will release their 
forms next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports are just another sign of how much Internet companies  
have become a powerful force in both political and financial 
circles, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The high-tech industry has been the golden boy of the last  
session of Congress,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of 
the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies political 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their batting average is as high, if not higher, than any  
other industry in Washington. Everyone is pursuing their money in 
campaign contributions and everyone is trying to attach themselves 
to what they see is a rising star,'' Makinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed several bills favorable to the industry last  
year, including a temporary ban on Internet taxes, fewer limits on 
hiring immigrants with computer skills, new copyright protections 
and $100 million for the next generation of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., boasted a diverse portfolio in  
high-tech stocks -- reporting investments of between $100,001 and 
$250,000 in Microsoft, $100,001-$250,000 in Intel and other large 
stakes in Sun, Cisco Systems, IBM, Dell and Network Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The senator doesn't feel any conflict of interest with any of  
his financial holdings. His voting record is totally divorced from 
any of his financial holdings,'' said Gary Hoitsma, Inhofe's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and his wife reported shares in Intel,  
Microsoft and Lucent Technologies worth between $250,000 and 
$600,000. Graham also reported owning stock in Sun Microsystems, 
Inc., MCI WorldCom Inc. and Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., who didn't vote in 1998,  
owns $500,001 to $1 million in IBM stock and $250,000-$500,000 each 
in Intuit, Motorola and Cisco Systems, which makes the equipment 
that makes up the backbone of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller Internet investors included Sens. Tim Hutchinson,  
R-Ark., and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska. Hutchinson purchased shares 
last December in America Online, Lucent and Ticketmaster Online. 
Murkowski owned $15,001 to $50,000 in Lucent stock along with 
shares in Sun, Motorola and Iomega. 
</P>
<P>
	Some senators reported their greatest wealth came from spouses.  
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Heinz, the wife of Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., is an heir  
to the H.J. Heinz food fortune through her late husband, former 
Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa. Her wealth has been estimated in the 
hundreds of millions of dollars, with investments that include more 
than $1 million in both Intel and Nokia and $500,001 to $1 million 
in Sun, according to Kerry's filing. 
</P>
<P>
	Another senator with a wealthy spouse was Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.,  
whose wife, Anne, reported making more than $1 million from the 
sale of stock options for Quest Communications, a cellular phone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial disclosure reports also provided some atypical  
investments: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., received framed ship's papers  
signed by President James Madison and Secretary of State Robert 
Smith worth $2,500 from the Conservative Political Action 
Committee. McConnell deemed it acceptable under the Senate gifts 
rule because it was presented in recognition of his public service 
work on behalf of the First Amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	--Sen Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., received a painting, worth $6,824,  
from the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation to celebrate the 
establishment of the Patrick J. Leahy Humanitarian Award 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Jim Bunning, R-Ky., who pitched a perfect baseball game  
in 1964 for the Philadelphia Phillies, earned $34,884 from baseball 
card shows and other memorabilia activities. Bunning, inducted into 
the Hall of Fame in 1996, received a waiver to accept a free trip 
to Cooperstown, N.Y., for last July's ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., the oldest member of the Senate  
at 96, valued four burial plots in Aiken, S.C., at between $1,001 
and $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., earned $29,286 in residuals from  
his work as a movie actor -- his credits include ``Hunt for Red 
October'' and ``Die Hard 2'' -- before entering politics.

<HEADLINE> ALS-Stricken Catfish Hunter Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter's arms dangled  
limply by his side. 
</P>
<P>
	He couldn't raise them to acknowledge the emotional ovation from  
the crowd, his old teammates, his family and the ballplayers there 
to honor him and play the game Hunter handled with such passion and 
skill during a 15-year Hall of Fame pitching career. 
</P>
<P>
	His 3-year-old grandson, Taylor, did it for him, waving his  
hands to the crowd as he, Hunter and his wife, Helen, circled the 
field in a 1965 Mustang convertible before Saturday's game between 
the Oakland Athletics and Los Angeles Dodgers. It was a day to 
recognize Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter, who is battling amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like only 10 years ago I was out here pitching,  
giving up all those home runs,'' said Hunter, back in Oakland to 
raise money to fight ALS. It was his first trip back since the A's 
retired his No. 27 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	The illness progressively destroys nerves controlling muscle  
movement and eventually can lead to paralysis and death. 
</P>
<P>
	It's responsible for withering Hunter's arms, including the  
golden right arm that helped him win 224 games, including a perfect 
game, and five World Series rings while playing for the Kansas City 
and Oakland Athletics and the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	As his grandfather stood behind him on the mound where he had  
pitched so well, Taylor threw out the ceremonial first pitch. There 
to catch it was Jim Pagliaroni, who caught Hunter's perfect game 
against Minnesota in Oakland on May 8, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``This day is a tribute to you and your ability to overcome any  
obstacle,'' former A's broadcaster Monte Moore said in an 
introduction that brought a roar from the crowd. ``Today is 
dedicated to your vision of living with ALS and your pursuit of a 
cure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pagliaroni was joined by other former A's teammates of Hunter  
who were part of a dynasty that won three straight World Series 
from 1972-74. They included Joe Rudi, Ray Fosse, Dick Green, John 
``Blue Moon'' Odom, Vida Blue, Rick Monday, Campy Campaneris and 
Reggie Jackson, who greeted Hunter with a kiss on the cheek during 
a news conference before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a small way to say, `I'm your friend,''' Jackson  
said. ``There was nothing more important for me than to be here 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the most respected player really I've ever been around.  
That's why you see all these players here in unison. We admired him 
for the way he carried himself and the person that he is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter was overwhelmed by the show of support and his voice  
cracked more than once. Near the end of the news conference, he was 
asked where he was in his fight with ALS and how he was doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The main thing is, ALS, there's no cure for it and I know  
that,'' Hunter said. ``God can cure it and that's the only way we 
can go. We can turn to doctors. We can turn to anything you want. 
But God's the only thing you can turn to, and your family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to live with it,'' Hunter added. ``You've got to  
keep on going. You can't stop. I'm not going to stop. That's the 
reason I'm out here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter's foundation, which received a $20,000 check from the A's  
before the game, is dedicated to increasing awareness of ALS and 
funding research grants. 
</P>
<P>
	Hunter said he's staying positive and giving his fight against  
ALS everything he has. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a saying in my locker when I was at Kansas City my  
first year,'' Hunter told the crowd. ``It said, `Winning isn't 
everything but wanting to is.' If you want to do something bad 
enough, you've got to work for it. That's what I'm going to do.''

time to chat with some Bush aides. 
</P>
<P>
	Ari Fleischer, an aide to Mrs. Dole, was seen giving a big hug  
to Mindy Tucker, his counterpart with Bush. Bush was in a holding 
room in a nearby hangar during the encounter and the two candidates 
didn't meet. 
</P>
<P>
	Tucker said Bush had planned to say hello to Mrs. Dole. ``I wish  
it would have happened,''' Fliescher said. ``It would have been a 
wonderful moment.''

<HEADLINE> Preparedness Expo Readies for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WASHINGTON, Pa. (AP) -- Militia man John Trochmann says  
people should prepare for the worst as the clock ticks toward the 
year 2000 -- even though he thinks the Y2K craze was cooked up by 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Need a place to start? Try Trochmann's book stand at  
Preparedness Expo '99, which runs through the weekend in suburban 
Philadelphia. There's a book on do-it-yourself herbal remedies and 
guides on field survival and guerrilla warfare tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain elements of the government that planned (the  
Y2K craze) this way. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure 
that out,'' says Trochmann, a Navy veteran and a member of the 
Militia of Montana. 
</P>
<P>
	Trochmann was one of about 200 vendors who set up shop Friday  
for the exposition, now in its 10th year. Aisles were lined with 
showcases on everything from freeze-dried foods to power generators 
to first-aid kits and holistic healing remedies. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Dan Chittock, who has helped set up the event since its  
first year in Salt Lake City, says the expo has attracted extra 
attention lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been especially busy this year because of the Year  
2000 computer glitch problem,'' Chittock says. ``People are coming 
because if you are prepared, you don't have to be worried about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chittock promotes the expo, which is making nine stops around  
the country, as an event ``for peace of mind in our changing 
world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It usually attracts outdoors enthusiasts, health-conscious  
people and those who work in emergency management. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, more Y2K worriers have been in attendance. Many believe  
computers will break down and malfunction when the calendar hits 
2000 because they were originally programmed to interpret the 
``00'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Some think that could lead to electricity being cut off and bank  
accounts wiped out. Others think it could even lead to a breakdown 
in social order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that the media is downplaying the whole issue,'' said  
expo attendee Michael Leon, 36, of Hempstead, N.Y. ``We can't rely 
on the government because they won't be able to help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Leon strolled the aisles looking for items he said he could  
stockpile in case of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	One stand sold unusual items such as ``The Miracle Trigger'', a  
$20 device resembling a water pistol that vendor Mary Enna of 
Divide, Colo., said uses a brief electrical pulse to ``break the 
cycle of pain.'' She said that could be useful in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearby, representatives of Long Beach, Calif.-based Organic by  
Nature talked about their plant-based dried juice products. Some of 
the main ingredients include grass and barley. 
</P>
<P>
	``It taste like tea or spinach, depending on who you ask,''  
manager Amy Veneer said. ``But add it in with apple juice and it 
tastes real good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say shows like Chittock's unjustly feed into Y2K  
paranoia. Organizations like the American Red Cross advise the 
public to prepare for the millennium by stocking disaster supplies 
for several days and keeping some extra cash on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Landis of Boston University's Center for Millenial  
Studies said the attention being paid today to the Y2K problem is 
part paranoia, part legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the greatest deadline in the history of mankind,''  
Landis said. ``It looks like it may not be disastrous, but we're 
not out of the woods yet.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Hall of Fame Turns 60 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. (AP) -- Every time Phil Niekro returns to  
Cooperstown, he makes a beeline for the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love coming back here, especially when your plaque's hanging  
on the wall,'' the former Atlanta Braves knuckleballer said. ``And 
it's still there. I keep checking. You can't help not to. When you 
walk in, you're going to go see if it's still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Niekro returned to Cooperstown again on Saturday, but his plaque  
was an afterthought. The Hall of Fame was marking its 60th 
anniversary, and Niekro was one of the guests of honor. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a mystique about this town that I've never felt in any  
other little town I've ever been to,'' Niekro said. ``It's a family 
town. It's super-friendly. It's got the lake, it's got the hills, 
it's got the fresh air. It's got everything you want in a little 
town.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And on this day it had a good old-fashioned parade, with Niekro,  
former Baltimore third baseman Brooks Robinson, and longtime 
Philadelphia Phillie Robin Roberts leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``What a great parade!'' Niekro said. ``The boys and girls and  
the grandmas and grandpas and the balloons, the bands. That was 
probably as good a parade as I've ever been in. There was a smile 
on every face. Every hand was waving. It was like you wanted to go 
sit on the curb and watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty years ago, about 15,000 people, most of them from in and  
around Cooperstown, attended the opening ceremonies of the Hall of 
Fame. On Saturday, a crowd of about 4,000 lined Main Street for the 
festivities. If only Ernie Banks were here -- the day was 
picture-perfect, fit to play two. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big thrill to be here,'' Robinson said. ``The guys  
should come back. I wouldn't miss it. It's part of a tradition. 
It's the greatest hall of fame there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The day also carried its share of nostalgia, especially for the  
small group of people known as the 39ers -- those who were here June 
12, 1939 when the doors to the Hall opened for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't sadness,'' recalled Catherine Walker, who was 8  
years old then and now works at the Hall of Fame as attendance 
supervisor. ``Just memories that have gone by. This is a special 
day. Who would have thought way back then as an 8-year-old that I 
would be riding in this parade?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's unlikely that any of the first five members -- Babe Ruth, Ty  
Cobb, Honus Wagner, Christy Mathewson, and Walter Johnson -- would 
recognize the place today. From its humble beginnings in a 
1,200-square-foot building, the Hall of Fame has undergone five 
expansions that have transformed it into a 60,000-square-foot mecca 
for baseball junkies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really something to think of that small building and what  
it's grown into,'' said Homer Osterhoudt, who as a 19-year-old 
worked on the construction of the three-story brick museum. ``This 
is a special day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And it was special in 1939, so much so that Ruth came out of  
retirement to play in an all-star game that also included the likes 
of Wagner, Eddie Collins, Charlie Gehringer, Dizzy Dean and Mel 
Ott. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Hall's attraction is its exclusivity -- only 181 of  
the more than 15,000 men who have played the game at its highest 
levels are enshrined. But getting in didn't occupy a lot of 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	't think any of us ever started out thinking we were going to be  
Hall of Famers,'' Robinson said. ``I certainly knew what it was all 
about. I knew the history of the game and what it represented. To 
be a part of it is absolutely wonderful. It's like your own little 
fraternity.''

<HEADLINE> Aging Pacers Face Many Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- This was to be the year the Indiana Pacers  
took the next step, winning their first NBA championship since 
entering the league in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the aging team once again began its summer vacation in  
late spring amid questions about whether coach Larry Bird will 
stick around. 
</P>
<P>
	A 90-82 victory Friday by the New York Knicks sent the Pacers  
home pondering their futures after being ousted in the conference 
finals for the fourth time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	The same problems that frustrated Indiana during the  
lockout-shortened season haunted the Pacers against the younger, 
smaller, quicker and more athletic Knicks. Inability to hold big 
leads and win close games in the final minutes proved fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	Club president Donnie Walsh now has a major challenge to prepare  
the team for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight players are 30 or older, including all five starters, and  
they're all under contract for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there's uncertainty if the competitive spirit that  
put Bird in the Hall of Fame as a player will allow him to overcome 
the disappointments of 1999 and return as coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very disappointed with the way we played in this  
series,'' said Bird. He has one more year on his contract as coach 
and has said he won't make any decision on his future until meeting 
with his players. 
</P>
<P>
	That meeting will take place sometime next week, when it is  
expected that the players will tell Bird they want him back. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's only consolation was a Central Division championship.  
</P>
<P>
	But Indiana lost two of its three games at home against New York  
after sweeping Milwaukee and Philadelphia in the first two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The only fingerpointing after the team's last loss was by Reggie  
Miller, who had a history for dramatic success in the playoffs, 
particularly against New York. He pointed at himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Horrendous. Horrendous,'' Miller said of his 3-for-18 shooting  
effort on Friday. ``A lot of open looks. They were looking to ride 
my back this round, and I didn't do it for them. So I have to take 
responsibility for that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm disappointed because I definitely feel like I let our  
franchise down -- really our state. For me to come up so short in 
such a crucial part and a crucial time, it's very difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird spread the blame around.  
</P>
<P>
	``It seemed like we always had three guys who played well in  
each game. We never did get the five guys that we needed to win the 
ball game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Pacers pushed eventual champion Michael Jordan  
and Chicago to seven games last year before falling in the final 
minutes of the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's going to be changes,'' Antonio Davis said Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``What changes will be made I don't know. But we've asked  
management time and time again to give us chances and they've given 
us chances and kept the team together and everybody feels like we 
let them down. So anything that they do I'm sure we're going to 
agree with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers began preparing for the season long before their  
union and management reached an agreement to end the lockout that 
threatened the season. Starting in October, nearly every player 
participated in voluntary workouts on an almost daily basis in 
anticipation it would pay off. 
</P>
<P>
	It did. At least for a while.  
</P>
<P>
	Indiana got off to its best start since joining the NBA, winning  
nine of its first 12 games. It finished the regular season with 
four consecutive victories, giving it a 33-17 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven straight playoff wins lifted Indiana's confidence.  
</P>
<P>
	Then came the Knicks, the first eighth-seeded team to reach the  
conference finals. New York ended Indiana's streak of 12 straight 
home playoff victories in Game 1, outscoring Indiana 11-3 in the 
final 2:09 for a 93-90 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana held on to win Game 2 88-86 after the Knicks managed to  
overcome a 17-point first-half deficit to lead 78-72 in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	New York regained the advantage in Game 3 on Larry Johnson's l  
four-point play at the buzzer. Indiana again tied the series in 
Game 4, then returned home to lose Game 5 after building a 28-14 
lead in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough, very tough,'' Mark Jackson said. ``All the work,  
all the effort, all the energy. Tough.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Testing Campaign Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush, the untested  
presidential front-runner, plunged into the 2000 campaign today by 
defending his ``compassionate conservative'' brand of politics as 
he hoped to rise to the high expectations set for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who leads in presidential polling despite not spending a  
single day on the campaign trail, began a four-day trip to the 
presidential proving grounds of Iowa and New Hampshire by boarding 
his aptly named ``Great Expectations'' campaign plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ready to go?'' Bush asked his press secretary. It is a  
question that will be asked about the Texas governor again and 
again in the coming weeks: Is Bush ready to go? 
</P>
<P>
	Bush joked about the expectations with reporters on his plane.  
Pretending he was the pilot, Bush seized a microphone and 
announced, ``Please store your expectations securely in the 
overhead bins, as they might shift during the trip and may fall and 
hurt someone -- especially me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor's speech today, the first major address of  
his 2000 Republican bid, traced the broad themes of the campaign 
without offering specific policies, according to advisers with 
access to drafts. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush argued that Republicans can be conservative -- cut taxes,  
trim welfare rolls, reduce crime, improve schools, demand and 
promote personal responsibility -- without being mean about it. He 
vowed not to retreat from criticism, saying he has chosen the 
ground of ``compassionate conservatism'' and will not waver from 
that spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he makes his first public campaign appearances today,  
Bush launched his White House bid with private fund-raising events 
Friday in St. Louis and Chicago. ``See you in Iowa,'' he told 
reporters afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have joined with GOP presidential rivals to call  
``compassionate conservatism'' poll-driven political jargon. Former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander accused Bush of using ``weasel 
words.'' Former Vice President Dan Quayle prohibited his staff from 
using them. 
</P>
<P>
	There might be a tinge of jealousy behind the criticism. Bush  
built a huge lead in polls while remaining in Austin, sheltered 
from the perils of campaigning as his foes traipsed across the 
country for months. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio and former American Red  
Cross president Elizabeth Dole were campaigning in Iowa today, 
ceding no ground to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, a distant second behind Bush in polling, unveiled a  
10-point farm plan and dispatched aides to tell reporters that she 
was offering specific proposals while the front-runner sticks to 
generalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich offered reporters a hamburger lunch if they travel with  
him Sunday, knowing few would accept. It was a lighthearted jab at 
Bush, who was holding a lobster bake for the more than 100 
journalists flying to Maine and New Hampshire to witness his coming 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, alarmed by polls showing Bush ahead of Vice President  
Al Gore, are linking the Texas governor to an unpopular Congress. 
More than half of House Republicans have endorsed the governor. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can't influence them now, how will you do it as  
president?''' Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic 
National Committee, asked rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush shrugged off the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a tempting target to say George W. is a person  
who hasn't had to fight for anything in his life,'' he said in an 
interview before the trip. ``But I know what I believe in and I 
know the battles I've been through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, is many ways the phantom front-runner. Though far  
ahead of the pack in polling, money-raising and endorsements, the 
son of former President George Bush is little-known outside Texas. 
He is also untested as a national candidate, anointed the GOP 
favorite without a single campaign appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	His success is due in part to his name. One recent poll found  
that when questioners distinguished between Bush and his father, 
the governor's ratings dropped 15 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush secured re-election in 1998 with nearly 70 percent of the  
vote, including large portions of female and minority voters who 
traditionally shy away from the GOP. Though the Texas governorship 
is given little constitutional power, Bush can take credit for 
higher school scores, less crime, fewer welfare cases and lower 
taxes in the nation's second largest state. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's blend of conservative politics couched in soothing,  
moderate rhetoric could help move the GOP to the center -- much as 
President Clinton refocused his party away from its liberal 
extremes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	His critics say Bush is poll-driven, ideologically shallow and a  
natural-born waffler. Bush fostered the criticism by giving vague 
or conflicting opinions on national issues while overseeing the 
state's legislative session this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Iowa, Bush planned to visit a charity to highlight his  
efforts in Texas to get faith-based organizations involved in 
solving social problems, a pet issue of conservatives that Gore 
embraced recently. He hopes to stake his claim to the issue without 
mentioning the vice president.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Force Part of US Deployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. forces are heading into an area marked by  
death, destruction and repression -- and a fragile hope for peace. 
Their destination: East Timor, where 33 Americans are joining a 
U.N. mission to ensure calm before a summer vote on independence. 
</P>
<P>
	From Western Sahara to Panama, Korea to Haiti, and now Kosovo,  
more than 200,000 Americans, both military and civilian, are 
helping to keep the peace or protect U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Balkans mission -- in which 7,000 Americans are expected to  
participate in a NATO-led security force of 50,000 -- has received 
all the attention of late. That mission is but a small part of a 
much larger U.S. effort worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest and longest-standing U.S. military commitments are  
in Western Europe and East Asia, with roughly 100,000 each. About 
70,000 U.S. troops are in Germany, 40,000 in Japan and 37,000 in 
South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 25,000 U.S. troops are in Saudi Arabia or on ships nearby.  
They help protect the kingdom from neighboring adversaries and 
enforce a no-fly zone over southern Iraq. A separate Turkish-based, 
U.S.-led operation enforces a no-fly zone over northern Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Haass of the Brookings Institution worries that the  
recent emphasis on humanitarian missions overseas could detract 
from security priorities, including Korea and the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to do the Kosovos of the world, we've got to  
make sure we've got sufficient capacity to handle the priorities,'' 
said Haass, a former National Security official in the Bush 
administration. ``That will require some increased resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American presence abroad often has a come-and-go quality.  
</P>
<P>
	Ending the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia should lead to a  
quick reassignment of the 37,000 U.S. forces assigned to that 
mission, along with the many thousands from other NATO countries. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Americans peacekeepers go to Kosovo, the 587 in  
neighboring Macedonia are being phased out now that there is less 
concern about Serb-induced instability in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	When international peacekeepers went into Bosnia in 1995 after a  
bloody civil war, the force included 20,000 Americans. Now, there 
are 5,900 U.S. troops in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military presence in Panama is listed at under 4,000  
and declining; by year's end, they all must be gone, under terms of 
the Panama Canal treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 450 U.S. troops in Haiti are building roads, wells and  
other civic action projects. But there is a strong move in Congress 
to bring them home by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In eastern Cuba, about 1,000 troops at the American naval base  
carry out training exercises and, on occasion, provide shelter for 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Not far away, U.S. military personnel ply the waters of the  
Caribbean in search of U.S.-bound narcotics-laden boats. They also 
fly AWACs and P-3 planes over the Andes, hoping to track drug 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, seeking to avert more fighting between Peru  
and Ecuador, has contributed 21 armed forces personnel to the 
region as part of a multinational effort. 
</P>
<P>
	American service members are in some of the remotest areas in  
the world: 15 serve as part of a U.N. mission in Western Sahara, an 
Arizona-sized desert south of Morocco that features sheep, goats 
and camels -- and not many people. The issue there is independence 
for the territory vs. ties with Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
	About 900 U.S. troops in the Sinai Desert enforce a peace treaty  
between Israel and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans normally provide only nominal participation at best in  
U.N. peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In East Timor, 30 U.S. civilian police officers and three  
military liaison officers will form part of a U.N. mission assigned 
to ensure calm as the territory prepares for an Aug. 8 referendum. 
The choice is between independence and continued links with 
Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Of 15 such U.N. operations, including the one in East Timor,  
Americans participate in only six with 256 personnel assigned, the 
bulk of them civilian police. 
</P>
<P>
	That represents less than 2 percent of the 12,132 U.N.  
peacekeepers worldwide compared with the 25 percent U.S. 
contribution to cover the costs of these operations; six countries 
provide more troops to the operations, led by Poland, Bangladesh 
and India.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Children's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- To a graduating class that applauded him, snubbed  
him and protested his free-trade pursuits, President Clinton 
pledged Saturday an intensified campaign against child labor ``in 
conditions that shock the conscience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president ordered government agencies and federal  
contractors to make sure they are not buying goods made by 
indentured underage workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could see the conditions these 8- and 9-year-olds work  
in,'' Clinton told graduates and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want them to go to school, if you understand those  
countries will never grow until they begin to educate their 
children, the girls as well as the boys ... We have to start with 
the abolition of child labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's speech to the University of Chicago Class of 1999  
capped a 3 1/2-hour commencement ceremony. On stage, he offered a 
handshake to each of the 820 diploma-clutching graduates. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen, most of them women, marched determinedly past  
Clinton and his proffered hand. One of them, English literature 
major Sandra Ruiz, said later that, among other things: ``I don't 
believe in his war tactics, his policy in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens more students affixed to their black robes and  
mortarboards stickers proclaiming, ``Fair trade, not free trade -- I 
signed the pledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The students, who signed a pledge not to take jobs that would  
``undermine social and economic justice,'' had said in advance they 
would protest Clinton's support for free trade, maintaining that it 
places a lower priority on worker rights and environmental 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton seamlessly wove their protest into his address, saying  
the stickers proved ``we're worried about this global economy, 
we're not sure it's working in a way that's fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has an obligation to help overseas economies  
and build overseas markets for U.S. goods on terms that ``enhance 
labor standards and environmental protection all across the 
world,'' he said to applause. 
</P>
<P>
	He outlined his new executive order directing federal agencies  
to list products suspected to have been made by forced child labor 
and requiring federal contractors to certify that they've 
determined no abusive child labor went into the goods they procure. 
</P>
<P>
	``In many, many communities around the world, tens of millions  
of children work in conditions that shock the conscience -- and send 
the products to us and to other wealthy countries,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government in 1997 bought $57 million of products made by  
industries known to rely heavily on child labor, according to Iowa 
Democrat Tom Harkin, the leading Senate proponent of child-labor 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has already identified several problem  
industries, including carpets and bricks from India and Pakistan; 
fishing platforms from Indonesia; and fireworks from Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Clinton travels to Geneva to address the  
International Labor Organization on the eve of a planned vote to 
adopt a convention ending abusive child labor, sweatshops and 
unsafe working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Before leaving Chicago, Clinton also addressed personnel from  
the Illinois Air National Guard's 126th Air Refueling Wing, 
thanking them for their participation in the NATO air campaign in 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	He said first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a Chicago native,  
wanted to join him but was in Palo Alto, Calif., Saturday bringing 
their daughter Chelsea home from college for the summer.

<HEADLINE> War Against Domestic Abuse Working </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five years after the O.J. Simpson case  
awakened a nation to domestic violence, local police and 
prosecutors have been given extensive training and new tools to 
combat abuse. And the federal government has pitched in with more 
than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden acceleration is welcome news for women's groups that  
labored for three decades to make the war against domestic abuse a 
national priority. The turning point, many say, was media and 
public attention from the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a widespread belief that if your husband beat you  
up, you would call police and they would take him away. Suddenly 
people realized that's not always how it happens,'' said Kim Gandy 
of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest statistics from the Justice Department show that 20  
percent of domestic violence calls result in arrests, but there are 
no national figures on how many of those arrested are prosecuted or 
convicted. In fact, federal data on domestic violence are 
notoriously incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
	Those on the local front say police and prosecutors more  
aggressively are pushing cases to court and are more eager to 
receive training. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many more police officers at trainings who are ready  
to learn, who want to do something different,'' said Anne O'Dell, a 
former San Diego detective who trains officers to handle domestic 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	On June 12, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald  
Goldman were murdered. Evidence quickly emerged that O.J. Simpson 
had beaten his ex-wife, and police and prosecutors charged that he 
killed them. He was acquitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Within months, Congress approved a $1.62 billion Violence  
Against Women Act, dedicating more money to the cause than ever 
before while creating new federal laws. Advocates say it may have 
passed without the Simpson case, but probably would have been pared 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	The law is up for renewal this year, and already there are  
proposals to toughen the current laws and authorize more money. 
Republicans, who often seek to cut other social spending, mostly 
have been supportive. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1994 law made several changes.  
</P>
<P>
	States had to honor protective orders issued by other states. It  
became a federal crime to cross state lines to abuse a domestic 
partner. Federal funding for shelters more than doubled. New grants 
were given to train police and prosecutors, set up special units 
and track incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for certain grants, states had to adopt policies that  
encourage police to arrest offenders on a domestic call. In many 
states, police now must make an arrest when they go to a domestic 
dispute or explain in writing why they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not always this way.  
</P>
<P>
	Police used to show up, walk the offending party around the  
block to calm him down and leave, sometimes putting the victim in 
further jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosemary Bratton, an advocate who trains police in Wyoming, said  
that for many years, police were hostile to learning new ways: 
``They would challenge everything we had to say.'' The atmosphere 
has markedly improved, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of police reluctance has stemmed from victims who summon  
police but later want the charges dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the training centers on a ``cycle of violence,'' where a  
batterer will apologize after a violent episode, promising it will 
never happen again. Many women want to believe this is true, so 
they press to drop the charges, only to see violence reoccur. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Dell said police are now trained to press a case -- even  
without the cooperation of the victim -- and to collect more 
evidence at the scene: witness statements, photos, and information 
from the initial call. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal grants are also creating special units to handle these  
cases, like one on Cleveland's lower west side. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic violence cases in the city's second district are  
handled by special detectives, prosecutors, and a victim advocate. 
The cases all go to Municipal Judge Ronald B. Adrine, who 
emphasizes treatment for batterers and imposes jail on those who do 
not comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Many judges hate these cases and try to get rid of them as  
quickly as possible, Adrine said. The key, he said, is 
understanding that offenders ``are very manipulative. If you allow 
them to play you, they will play you,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many judges resist education and training, believing it will  
compromise their objectivity, he said. That sometimes frustrates 
advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	But progress continues, including heightened media coverage. The  
number of times domestic violence was mentioned in U.S. newspapers 
and magazines more than doubled in the year after the Simpson 
arrest and has continued to climb since. 
</P>
<P>
	That has helped motivate activists around the country.  
</P>
<P>
	``We energized and politicized a whole generation of activists  
whose whole job was mostly to buy toys for the battered women's 
shelter and never thought their job was to talk to the mayor,'' 
said Pat Reuss, who led a coalition that lobbied for the federal 
law. ``Now they're working with cops and prosecutors.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Children's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Signaling a stepped-up effort against child labor  
worldwide, President Clinton today ordered U.S. government agencies 
to make sure not to buy products made by indentured underage 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the University of Chicago's commencement  
ceremony, the president announced an executive order directing 
federal agencies to list products suspected to have been made by 
forced child labor. The order also requires federal contractors to 
certify they tried to determine whether child labor was used in 
goods they sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Any contractor who does not comply or violates the child labor  
ban would be barred from future dealings with the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you could see the conditions these 8- and 9-year-olds work  
in,'' Clinton told students and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The government in 1997 bought $57 million of products made by  
industries known to rely heavily on child labor, according to Sen. 
Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week, Clinton travels to Geneva to speak to the  
International Labor Organization. He will urge acceptance of a new 
convention to end egregious examples of child labor, sweatshops and 
unsafe working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's focus on child labor comes as he tries to revive his  
push to further open overseas markets to U.S. products and advance 
an agenda to stabilize the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	He made his call for Congress to pass expedited trade  
negotiating authority for presidents, and other free-trade 
legislation, with an eye toward members of his own party who have 
stymied his efforts in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Organized labor, in particular, has fought Clinton and his  
allies in the free trade fight -- Republicans and the business 
community -- because of worries about other countries' more lax 
protections for workers and the environment. Opponents of so-called 
``fast-track'' negotiating authority want workers' rights spelled 
out in all trade agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	In an attempt to satisfy those critics, Clinton stressed -- as he  
has for months -- the importance of such issues along with the 
opportunity the global economy provides. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to figure out how to build a system that is both free  
and fair,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, about a dozen students declined -- a couple with dramatic  
gestures -- to shake the hand of the president, who stood on the 
platform as they crossed to receive their diplomas. Many wore 
stickers saying, ``Fair trade, not free trade -- I signed the 
pledge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of students had said in advance they would protest  
Clinton's planned emphasis on free trade because they said his 
policies have placed a lower priority on labor and environmental 
standards. They signed a pledge not to take jobs that would 
``undermine social and economic justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also foreshadowed an upcoming agreement among the  
world's major powers to reform global financial systems as a 
prevention against the kind of economic turmoil that rocked Asia 
and Latin America and rippled throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton said leading industrial nations are close  
to a plan to triple the debt relief available to the world's 
poorest nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did not deliver the official commencement address for  
the 820 undergraduates' ceremony, but instead served as a 
``distinguished guest speaker.'' University rules established after 
World War II allow only faculty members to give the commencement 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules also prevented the president from receiving an  
honorary degree, as is customary when a president speaks at a 
college commencement. Only leading academic scholars are afforded 
that privilege by the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, Clinton planned to thank personnel from the  
Illinois Air National Guard's 126th Air Refueling Wing who 
participated in the NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Boy Drives After Dad Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- An 8-year-old boy grabbed the wheel of a  
tractor-trailer rig and steered it to a safe stop after his father 
suffered a fatal heart attack on a major highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Burness, 40, had taken his son, also named Ricky, along on  
a run to Baltimore to deliver a shipment of auto glass and was 
headed back home to Cedar Bluff, Va., state police spokeswoman Lucy 
Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	They were on the Capital Beltway just south of Washington, D.C.,  
when Burness felt ill early Saturday, Ms. Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He called the boy awake. Ricky came and sat next to his  
father, and within a few minutes his father collapsed behind the 
wheel,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck, which was on an exit ramp from the beltway to another  
highway, swerved and struck a sign and a light pole on the left 
side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	As it veered back toward the right, Ricky grabbed the wheel, hit  
the brakes and stopped the truck before it could spin out of 
control, Ms. Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy then used his father's CB radio to call for help.  
</P>
<P>
	Two truckers stopped to help the boy. Police and emergency  
response teams arrived soon after. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an extremely responsible boy who can stop a truck like  
that under those kinds of conditions,'' Ms. Caldwell said. ``The 
other truckers who were there and the police and rescue squads are 
calling him a hero.''

<HEADLINE> Hare Krishnas Threatened by Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALACHUA, Fla. (AP) -- Hare Krishnas with shaved heads and saffron  
robes still preach ``God consciousness'' on the streets and in 
temples. But in private talks and on public Web sites, many accuse 
their fellow devotees of the most godless of crimes. After 
surviving scandals involving drug and weapons charges against some 
leaders, the movement is in crisis again. This time the issue is 
child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	For at least a decade, current and ex-devotees claim, leaders of  
the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, 
knowingly permitted suspected sex offenders to work among 2,000 
children in its boarding schools. Now a law firm that has won 
millions from the Catholic Church is taking their case. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this could threaten the Hare Krishnas, the Eastern  
spiritual community that flowered in 1960s America only to wither 
in the '80s, a reminder of a lost ideal. 
</P>
<P>
	When the charges surfaced last fall, leaders pledged to atone.  
They were lauded for extraordinary openness when they acknowledged 
sexual, physical, and emotional abuse at the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Hare Krishna leaders announced in May that they would pledge  
$250,000 a year to investigate past child abuse and aid survivors. 
The group's Office of Child Protection compiled the names of 200 
people who allegedly inflicted abuse in the 1970s and '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the office reports it has finished investigating 30  
cases. The organization says the investigators' pace is 
appropriately deliberate, but it has some former students 
questioning how serious movement leaders are. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's spin control,'' says Nirmal Hickey, 28, a boarding school  
veteran whose father was the Hare Krishna minister of education. 
``It's totally phony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After years of silence, former students are lashing out at the  
movement. While some, like Hickey, have left completely, more live 
on the fringes. They chant in Hare Krishna temples, sometimes side 
by side with people they accuse of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas attorney Windle Turley is building a case on those  
survivors' behalf. ``We just made a decision to plunge forward on a 
very large scale,'' he says, refusing to provide details of a 
planned lawsuit. In 1997, Turley won a $120 million judgment in a 
sex abuse case against the Catholic Diocese of Dallas and agreed to 
a $30 million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	How movement officials respond will likely determine whether  
they hold onto their second generation, whether they become a model 
for religious groups or a warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have nothing to lose,'' says ex-student Arjuna, who like  
many Hare Krishnas adopted a single Hindu name. ``They have us to 
lose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	It was the height of the '60s when the Indian guru, A.C.  
Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, brought his distinctive form of 
devotional Hinduism to the United States. Soon, thousands of 
Westerners were wearing saris and pajama-like dhotis, living in 
Hare Krishna temple compounds, and chanting the mantra they 
believed would lead to a greater awareness of God known as Krishna. 
</P>
<P>
	George Harrison of the Beatles turned the chant into a pop  
mantra -- but this wasn't rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
	Prabhupada taught that celibacy was a means to achieve the  
highest spiritual state, and even married couples were not to 
engage in sex more than once a month. Children, he said, should be 
sent to boarding schools at age 5 so they could learn to be pure 
devotees, liberated from familial ``ropes of affection.'' Parents 
were then freed to sell devotional books and do other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sent my son away so I would be acceptable in the movement,''  
says one mother, Nikunjavasini. ``I thought he would have a more 
simple life in a more pure environment. I wanted so badly to 
believe in purity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the 1970s, 11 schools, known as gurukulas or  
houses of the guru, were operating in North America with several 
more around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Krsna Avitara, still boyish and lanky at 32, remembers seeing  
the movement's promotional films of children running through fields 
in Vrindavan, India, home of a Hare Krishna boys' boarding school. 
His parents, a pharmacist and a real estate broker in Miami, had 
joined the movement when he was 7. He grew up surrounded by 
pictures of his namesake, Krishna, a puckish blue-skinned deity who 
frolicked with the cowherds in his Vrindavan paradise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that we were going to do the same,'' Krsna Avitara  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	But there were no cowherds to greet the American boys with  
shaved heads and topknots when they arrived in Vrindavan in 1980. 
Home was a square concrete building with stone floors. One hundred 
boys ages 5 to 18 slept on mats and picked worms from their meals. 
</P>
<P>
	The day began at 3 a.m. with a march to the showers, followed by  
chanting in the temple. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. Krishna Krishna. Hare Hare.''  
</P>
<P>
	The ``gurukulis,'' as the students were known, attended classes  
in Hindi, Sanskrit, Hindu scripture, English and history, often 
taught by young, untrained teachers who lived with them. Most were 
the followers deemed least likely to succeed at proselytizing and 
fundraising, says E. Burke Rochford, Jr., a sociology professor at 
Middlebury College in Vermont, who has studied the Hare Krishnas 
for two decades and was asked by the organization to look into the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Many instructors lashed out at their charges, he and former  
students say. A week after he arrived, Krsna Avitara, then 12, says 
he was grabbed, hit and kicked by a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all had the same prayer,'' he says: ```Krishna, get me the  
hell out of here.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Some teachers were different, the ones who'd sneak out and buy  
them lemonade or care for boys with malaria. Festivals were the 
highlights. The newly outfitted students were paraded like priests 
before adoring crowds of Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But school offered few respites. Some children dreaded going to  
sleep, anticipating teachers' sexual advances. Referring to one 
teacher, Krsna Avitara says: ``A lot of my friends slept with him. 
We thought that this was what love was about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former devotee Ben Bressack, 28, says that beginning at age 10  
he was singled out by an 18-year-old teacher's assistant in 
Vrindavan. ``I was his girlfriend or boyfriend for years,'' he 
says. ``It was accepted. I didn't know any different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raghunatha, 34, says he endured beating during his first years  
at the schools, then at 15 was chosen to become a teacher's 
assistant. ``I beat the hell out of Krsna Avitara,'' says 
Raghunatha, who has since apologized. 
</P>
<P>
	Girls also report emotional and physical abuse.

	Rukmini, a student at the Los Angeles gurukula, describes a  
teacher attacking her with a metal pole. Her best friend, Jahnavi, 
says she was made to lick up a drink she'd spilled on the ground. 
More painful was being forced to sleep naked in a bathtub because 
she wet her bed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My security, love, peace of mind were taken away from me,''  
she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Sociologist Rochford says it is impossible to know how many of  
the approximately 2,000 boarding school students were abused. Even 
the most loyal Hare Krishnas tend to agree with his assessment that 
much of the harm occurred because the movement that prized celibacy 
did not value its children. 
</P>
<P>
	``Marriage and family life came to represent a sign of spiritual  
weakness,'' Rochford wrote in an article commissioned by an 
official publication of the International Society of Krishna 
Consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	Most parents, he wrote, ``accepted theological and other  
justifications offered by the leadership for remaining uninvolved 
in the lives of their children,'' though a Hare Krishna spokesman, 
Anuttama, says protecting children was a basic value. 
</P>
<P>
	Few students recall telling their parents about the abuse.  
Letters were censored, family visits rare. Bressack, for one, says 
he barely knew his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wasn't anyone special to me,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Only recently did she learn of the abuse. ``Every day she  
apologizes,'' says Bressack's brother, Arjuna. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Nikunjavasini, mother of another former student:  
``Sending my son away was the biggest mistake of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hare Krishnas debate how much their leaders knew about child  
abuse and when. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1986, former devotee Kenneth Capoferri was convicted of seven  
counts of lewd and lascivious conduct with young children at a 
child care center run by the Hare Krishnas in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, Frederick DeFrancisco, a teacher's assistant at the  
Hare Krishna farm in New Vrindaban, W.Va., was convicted of sex 
offenses against a child. 
</P>
<P>
	Anuttama, the spokesman for the Hare Krishnas, says that the  
GBC, or governing commission of top leaders, did not understand the 
depth of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	But longtime Hare Krishna Nara Narayan disagrees: ``The GBC was  
aware of the gurukula abuses from the very beginning ... I 
personally witnessed severe child abuse by the teachers and 
registered complaints to no avail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even a GBC member, Hare Vilas, says his colleagues were aware of  
the problem since the late 1980s and failed to act. ``The GBC has 
always been lackadaisical about going after perpetrators,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Former devotee Peter Chatterton, a father who once headed the  
international association of ISKCON temple presidents, says his 
family felt the repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
	Chatterton's teen-age sons hadn't said much when they returned  
home to Vancouver, B.C., after graduating from the Vrindavan school 
in the mid-1980s. Their story only emerged after Chatterton's 
daughter married a former Vrindavan teacher, Steven Kapitany. Six 
months into the marriage, a 12-year-old boy said Kapitany had 
molested him in Vancouver. Chatterton's son then divulged that 
Kapitany had abused him in Vrindavan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kapitany was eventually found guilty of sexual assault and  
sentenced to six months in jail in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, three of Chatterton's children told him that  
another Hare Krishna man had abused them. Chatterton asked 
Kalankatha, then temple president, to ban the man from the premises 
but he refused. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have moved heaven and earth if I'd had a shred of  
proof,'' Kalankatha says. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Hare Vilas, the regional director, asked the  
man to leave. But by then Chatterton had left the movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took all my faith and dumped it,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Hare Krishnas left the movement en masse during the 1980s, many  
sensing a growing disconnect between the group's espoused values 
and its gurus' behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In one case, a guru named Swami Bhaktipada was accused by  
prosecutors of ordering the murders of two members in the 1980s. In 
a plea bargain in 1996, he pleaded guilty to racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
	After a financial collapse, the movement closed all but a  
handful of its boarding schools worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	As disillusioned students left, their Hare Krishna parents often  
rejected them as failures, says Laxmimoni, now head of the Hare 
Krishnas' last U.S.-based boarding school, in Alachua, a rural town 
in north central Florida and home to the largest American Hare 
Krishna community. 
</P>
<P>
	But within a few years, students began coming back. Some say  
they returned because they had few job skills and little 
understanding of life outside. Others missed the intensity of the 
spiritual life. 
</P>
<P>
	In Alachua, hundreds of members practice the religion to varying  
degrees. Nationwide, about 100,000 worshipers attend Sunday 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really religious,'' says Krsna Avitara says, sitting  
in his sparsely furnished apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, images of Krishna flash on his computer screen, and an  
altar to the deity sits above his stereo. Each Sunday he, his 
18-year-old live-in girlfriend, Premanjana, and his old friend, 
Arjuna, go to the temple to chant and dance with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's intoxicating,'' Premanjana says.  
</P>
<P>
	Krsna Avitara nods. ``It's in our blood.''  
</P>
<P>
	Arjuna, 24, believes many early Hare Krishnas were lost hippies  
who misunderstood Prabhupada's teachings. His own father was a 
potato farmer in a nudist commune when Prabhupada visited. ``My 
brother was named Rainbow,'' he says, ``so you can tell where my 
mother was at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But religious truth, he maintains, transcends its adherents.  
</P>
<P>
	``Krishna is another name for God, and I have true love for  
God,'' he says. ``All the (Catholic) fathers accused of molestation 
didn't change Jesus Christ's teachings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The first public airing of child abuse came in May 1996 when 10  
former boarding school students addressed Hare Krishna leaders who 
had gathered in Alachua. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen 100 grown men cry before,'' says Jahnavi, who  
now heads Children of Krishna, an organization formed around the 
same time to help abuse survivors like herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The response looked promising. Hare Krishna leaders pledged  
$105,000 from their personal funds to the ex-students. During the 
next three years, Children of Krishna would give $85,000 in grants 
for counseling, education, and seed money for businesses. A year 
later the community formed the ISKCON Child Protection Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
	Krsna Avitara, who earned an economics degree from the  
University of Florida, was so encouraged he volunteered to teach at 
the boys' boarding school in Alachua. But it wasn't long before new 
doubts arose. 
</P>
<P>
	Half the ISKCON leaders did not come through with their personal  
pledges, spokesman Anuttama acknowledged. And temple leaders' plans 
to raise funds to build a multimillion-dollar temple in Mayapur, 
India, angered devotees who thought the money should go to 
ex-students. 
</P>
<P>
	So far the Office of Child Protection has conducted training on  
preventing child abuse and it has collected names of 200 alleged 
abusers, according to its head, Dhira Govinda, a social worker for 
the state of Florida's children and family services agency, whom 
former students call an advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the 30 people investigated, at least three suspects have  
been banned from Hare Krishna temples; another is in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, as lawyers gather their own evidence, former students  
voice mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	Arjuna has no interest in suing or leaving. Instead, he says,  
``We're going to raise our children in loving homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krsna Avitara agrees: ``I don't want any money from these  
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What he does want is assurance that the smallest child can learn  
about Krishna without being abused in his name.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Deny News Has Influence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- On his way to Heritage High School a few  
hours after a 15-year-old student wounded six classmates, Rockdale 
District Attorney Richard Read saw tearful students clinging to 
each other in shock. 
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, he faced cameras and microphones as the news  
media covered the nation's latest school shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Read says it was not the news coverage that cemented his  
decision to seek permission to try the juvenile suspect in the May 
20 shooting as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who makes a decision like this in a vacuum is acting  
irresponsibly,'' says Read. ``But to put it simply, this kid walked 
into a school, opened fire, and by doing that, robbed a community 
of its sense of security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As public attention focuses on the recent rash of school  
shootings, prosecutors say they don't pander to the media or voters 
when they decide to move high-profile juvenile cases to adult 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	But some child advocates disagree, arguing that lawmakers and  
prosecutors are sacrificing the future of many savable children in 
an effort to appear tough on crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have given the prosecutors absolute discretion,  
you've skewed the system,'' says Helen Leiner, chair of the 
juvenile justice committee of the National Association of Criminal 
Defense Lawyers. ``High-profile cases result in high-profile 
responses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Conyers case, Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon faces 21 charges  
including aggravated assault, cruelty to children and weapons 
violations and a potential sentence of 351 years in prison if 
convicted. If a judge decides to keep the case in juvenile court, 
Solomon's maximum sentence would be 60 months in the youth system. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Justice Department, 40 states and the District  
of Columbia passed laws in 1992-1995 making it easier for juveniles 
to be tried as adults. Thirty-eight of the states expanded laws 
covering crimes that automatically require adult treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a positive trend, if you ask me,'' said James  
Backstrom, the Dakota County Attorney in Hastings, Minn., and 
co-chair of the National District Attorneys Association's juvenile 
justice advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Georgia strengthened rules against juveniles charged  
with what prosecutors call the ``seven deadly sins'' -- murder, 
voluntary manslaughter, armed robbery, rape, aggravated sexual 
battery, aggravated sodomy and aggravated child molestation. Anyone 
over 13 who is charged with one of these crimes is automatically 
tried in adult court. 
</P>
<P>
	Any other cases -- except for defendants 15 or older involving a  
charge with a possible life sentence -- require prosecutors to 
petition the juvenile court to have the case moved. Read has begun 
that process in Solomon's case; the court is awaiting the results 
of psychological exams before holding a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the number of juvenile cases moved to adult court is  
up to 1 percent in 1996 from less than 0.6 percent in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Leiner says the system is unfair to many children, citing  
the case of a mentally disabled 15-year-old in Florida who was put 
in an adult jail -- his family couldn't afford the $500 bail -- and 
faced a life sentence for stealing $2 in lunch money. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida prosecutors have the discretion to take any juvenile  
case to adult court involving a violent felony. However, the 
charges against Anthony Laster were dropped after the lead witness 
changed his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	In a high-profile Georgia case, 15-year-old Jonathan Miller was  
tried as adult after a fatal attack on a 13-year-old neighbor. 
Miller, who hit the boy in the back of the head and then kicked 
him, was convicted of murder and assault and sentenced to life in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Ridge Circuit District Attorney Garry Moss said media  
attention surrounding Miller's case had nothing to do with his 
decision to bring charges that automatically moved the case to 
adult court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an elective office and should be political,'' Moss  
added. ``We are the public's most accessible office when it comes 
to law enforcement, but it's still our responsibility to do the law 
right first, and then worry about the public.''

<HEADLINE> Maryland Commuter Train Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDY HOOK, Md. (AP) -- Two men waiting for friends after a day  
of tubing on the Potomoc River were killed when they were struck by 
a passenger train, Maryland State Police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Bricken, 20, and Michael Caputo, 21, died instantly  
Friday evening after being hit by the Maryland Commuter Rail 
Service train, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train was carrying about 50 people and was traveling at  
about 50 mph. Passengers were loaded onto another train. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Lu Herman, spokeswoman for the state police, said the  
victims were waiting for two people who had gone to fetch their 
car. She said the engineer did not see them. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men were sitting on inner tubes at the edge of the  
tracks as the train neared, said Rebekah White, who was near the 
scene with members of her family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then the first gentleman was cartwheeling through the air,  
arms and legs going everywhere, and the other gentleman was like a 
top spinning around on the road,'' said her husband, Rocky White. 
</P>
<P>
	The witnesses rushed over to check for signs of life, but both  
men were dead.

<HEADLINE> Lobo To Miss WNBA Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rebecca Lobo, the New York Liberty's leading  
rebounder the past two years, will have to watch her teammates 
rebound for the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo's season lasted all of 42 seconds. It was ended by a torn  
anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee in the first minute of 
the Liberty's season opener against the Cleveland Rockers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm terribly disappointed that this happened,'' Lobo said  
Friday at Beth Israel Hospital, where she was undergoing therapy. 
``But I'm upbeat because I'm in great care. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be on the sidelines during the season cheering on my  
teammates. I will be back next season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Lobo, who led Connecticut to a 35-0 record and the  
NCAA championship in 1995, will be difficult to replace. 
</P>
<P>
	In the WNBA's first two seasons, she averaged 12.1 points and  
7.1 rebounds while playing in all 58 New York games. During the 
league's inaugural season in 1997, she was chosen to the All-WNBA 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge loss to our team,'' general manager Carol  
Blazejowski said. ``You don't replace a player of Rebecca's caliber 
overnight. The team, as a whole, will have to raise their level of 
play and fill the void that this injury creates to our team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty coach Richie Adubato, making his Liberty debut, was  
heartbroken. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rebecca is an integral part of both our team's offense and  
defense,'' he said. ``Losing her for the rest of the season is 
difficult. She was having a great training camp and playing very 
well. ... It now means that her teammates are going to have to step 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last four or five days, she was rebounding, knocking down  
jump shots, catching the ball in the low post and making her 
move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Teresa Weatherspoon: ``It's an awful feeling to know what  
Rebecca is going through. ... We will definitely pick it up for 
Rebecca.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Wicks, a member of the 1987 gold medal-winning U.S. team at  
the Pan American Games, will play additional minutes, as will 
rookies Tamika Whitmore and Michele VanGorp. 
</P>
<P>
	Team physician Dr. Susan Craig-Scott said Lobo will have surgery  
in 2-3 weeks. Craig-Scott said Lobo's rehabilitation will take a 
minimum of six months. 
</P>
<P>
	``She should be ready next season,'' the doctor said. ``We  
expect her to be back. She's a tough kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo was in tears Thursday night, especially when talking to her  
mother at the hospital and when speaking with her father by 
telephone. She was more upbeat Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope my New Year's Eve present will be that I will be back  
on the court,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was very upset when the injury first occurred, but she  
calmed down in the locker room.'' Craig-Scott said. ``She was in 
good spirits this morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo, the youngest member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic team that won  
the gold medal, said her worst injury before this season required 
arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt anything like this before,'' she said. ``It's the  
first injury that's taken me out of commission for this long a 
time. It's the first time I've had something of this magnitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo was hurt while grabbing a rebound after Kym Hampton's  
missed shot. She pivoted and fell, clutching her leg for about 30 
seconds as play continued before an official called an injury 
timeout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went in, got a sweet offensive rebound,'' Lobo said. ``And  
when I came down, I thought somebody hit me on the side of the 
knee, and it just buckled. ... But people who watched video of the 
play said nobody hit me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo was helped off the floor by Hampton and Wicks.  
</P>
<P>
	``She was crying,'' Wicks said. ``I didn't even ask her how she  
was, she just shook her head. She knew immediately that it was bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rebecca's so tough that she wouldn't stay on the ground with a  
twisted ankle or something small. I've never seen her cry, so you 
know it's bad.''

<HEADLINE> Witness: Shot Woman Was Defenseless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A woman killed by police gunfire had her hands in  
the air and was telling officers she was getting out of a car when 
she was shot, according to a woman who says she witnessed the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's shaking and saying 'I'm getting out, I'm getting out,''  
Lanita Gray told the Chicago Tribune. ``Then the gun goes off. I 
don't think (the officer) knew she shot her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of two cases last weekend in which Chicago police  
killed unarmed people during traffic stops. In the other shooting, 
police said a Northwestern University student was shot when he 
tried to grab an officer's gun. In both cases, the victims and the 
officers were black. 
</P>
<P>
	The shootings have prompted an inquiry by the U.S. Department of  
Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, 21, said she was at a South Side store with her children  
the night of June 4 when LaTanya Haggerty was killed, the Tribune 
reported in Saturday editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggerty was a passenger in a car that police had stopped for an  
expired license plate. The Chicago Sun-Times reported Friday that 
an unidentified source said the driver tried to hit them and that 
officers said they opened fire when the man pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
	After the car was stopped again, the driver ran away and  
Haggerty was shot, police say, when patrol officer Serena Daniels 
mistook a cellular phone in her hand for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't have to shoot that girl,'' Gray said. ``They think  
everything's a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said she heard Daniels curse to herself after she shot  
Haggerty and then later saw her stroke Haggerty's hair. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chicago police spokeswoman declined to discuss Gray's comments  
when contacted Saturday by The Associated Press. Spokeswoman Lauri 
Sanders said she did not know if investigators had interviewed 
Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Gray by the AP were unsuccessful.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tribune quoted unidentified sources as saying her account is  
consistent with other witness accounts of what happened the night 
the 26-year-old Haggerty died. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no comment Saturday from Daniels, whose home telephone  
number is not listed. 
</P>
<P>
	Haggerty's family has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the  
city of Chicago and Daniels.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Forms in Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Arlene, the season's first tropical storm in the  
Atlantic, formed far out at sea Saturday with winds near 50 mph and 
signs it would strengthen slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The primary good news is that it's no threat to anyone'' for  
now, said John Guiney, forecaster at the National Hurricane Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Saturday the storm was located about 485 miles southeast of  
Bermuda, or about 1,200 miles off the mid Atlantic Coast. It was 
moving toward the northwest at 2 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene was expected to strengthen with sustained wind reaching  
52 mph Sunday and to drift slowly northwestward, taking it slightly 
closer to Bermuda. Storms aren't called hurricanes until sustained 
wind reaches 74 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's still going be well enough away to not have any impact at  
all,'' Guiney said. ``I guess it just alerts us to the fact that 
the season has begun in earnest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pioneer of hurricane forecasting, Colorado State University  
professor William Gray, expects 14 named storms this season, the 
most he has predicted since beginning his annual forecasts in 1984. 
Nine are expected to become hurricanes, compared with an average of 
six over the past 49 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration issued its  
first preseason forecast this year, calling for three or more 
intense hurricanes. Two is normal in the June-through-November 
season.

<HEADLINE> Runner Marion Jones Returns to N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Marion Jones won the long jump on her sixth  
leap after three scratches Saturday at the Pontiac Grand Prix 
Invitational, an effort that was the best by an American this year 
but left her lying in the sand pit gripping her knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones went 23 feet on her final jump to overtake Adrien Sawyer,  
who jumped 22-4 1/2, and hyperextended her knee in the process. Sawyer 
had the best American jump this year, 22-5 1/4. Jones was one-half 
inch short of the best jump in the world this year by Fiona May of 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-event meet was held at the North Carolina State track  
where Jones trains six times a week. It was the final competition 
for most U.S. athletes before the USA Championships later this 
month in Eugene, Ore. The meet was held before the Foot Locker 
Outdoor Championships for high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones zipped down the runway on her first two jumps, but  
couldn't best 22-1 3/4 on either attempt. She encouraged the crowd to 
cheer her on by clapping her hands over her head, but on the next 
three jumps she scratched. 
</P>

	``After the first legal jump, it was time to crank it up,''  
Jones said. ``I definitely had a seven-meter jump in me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After landing on her sixth and final try, Jones grabbed her  
right knee and sat in the pit until her distance was measured. 
Jones was able to walk away and later came to the awards platform 
with an ice pack wrapped around her knee. She described the injury 
as a hyperextension. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came down wrong on my knee,'' Jones said. ``I think I scared  
myself a little bit. ... Sitting here now, I'm not really concerned 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After she won, Jones was surrounded by high school athletes  
snapping pictures and clamoring for autographs as she iced her 
right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's my hero,'' said 15-year-old Chinel Davis, a sprinter and  
long jumper from Bardonia, N.Y. Jodi Schlesinger, 18, a triple 
jumper from Bardonia, said she was going to take some of the sand 
from the long jump pit as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
	Jearl Miles-Clark was clocked in 50.68 seconds in the 400  
meters, the best time in the world this year. The best clocking had 
been 50.76 by Cathy Freeman of Australia and Suziann Reid of the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Regina Jacobs improved her best time of this year in the 800 --  
1:59.64 -- with a 1:58.55. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so inspired by all the high school athletes, I was not  
going to dog it around the track,'' said Jacobs, who admits she's a 
high school track ``junkie.''

<HEADLINE> It's Spurs-Knicks for the NBA Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	So this is what the post-Jordan, post-lockout NBA has given us:  
</P>
<P>
	An atypical postseason in which a dysfunctional,  
injury-decimated No. 8 seed can advance to the final round against 
a team of former softies who now look like a superpower. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Knicks and San Antonio Spurs are this year's  
finalists, and for the first time in four years the main mid-June 
attraction will not be a baldheaded shooting guard with icewater in 
his veins. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's enticements are as interesting as they are new:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Team Turmoil from the East, a Knicks squad with a coach, Jeff  
Van Gundy, in career limbo; a franchise center, Patrick Ewing, 
whose leg is in a cast; a former Public Enemy No. 1, Latrell 
Sprewell, who has found redemption in Sin City; and an 
underachiever, Marcus Camby, who has turned into a terror. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Team Terrific from the West, a Spurs squad with Tim Duncan,  
the best young 7-footer to come around in years, lining up 
alongside another 7-footer, David Robinson, who was the MVP not too 
long ago; and a supporting cast of former castoffs who have learned 
how charming life can be when most of their shots are open ones. 
</P>
<P>
	On paper, the series looks lopsided. San Antonio, with a 10-game  
postseason winning streak, was listed Saturday in Las Vegas as a 
10-point favorite for Game 1 Wednesday night at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	That will be no surprise to the Knicks, who have been called  
underdogs -- and dogs -- all season long. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come a long way, showed a lot of character,'' Ewing  
said. ``We're right there knocking on the door, all we have to do 
is kick it open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While much of New York was still basking in the afterglow of the  
Knicks' Game 6 victory Friday night over the Indiana Pacers, the 
Spurs were back at work in San Antonio trying not to underestimate 
an opponent that has overcome endless bouts of adversity. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one expects an eighth-seed to do what they did,'' coach  
Gregg Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	``And then when you see that Patrick's not there and Larry  
Johnson missed a big part of the game, of course that's a little 
bit surprising. When you think about the commitment they have to 
each other and how much they've played as a team, then it becomes a 
lot more plausible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs know that the Knicks without Ewing are going to have  
big problems defending Duncan and Robinson. What they don't know is 
how they'll react to playing in a spotlight much brighter than 
anything they've been under before. 
</P>
<P>
	All season long, the Spurs have perplexed opponents who have had  
to choose strategies: Should they double-team Duncan and Robinson 
in the low post and try to make their teammates beat them? Or do 
they defend the Twin Towers with single coverage and try to keep 
everyone else in check? 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks seem to subscribe to the latter theory.  
</P>
<P>
	``We know their big guys are going to get off and do things for  
their team,'' Sprewell said. ``We have to contain the other guys 
and not let them be big parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the finals begin, the Spurs will have had nine full  
days off since completing their sweep of the Portland Trail Blazers 
in the Western Conference finals. San Antonio also swept the Los 
Angeles Lakers in the second round and won its final two games in 
the first round against Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 10-game postseason winning streak is one shy of the NBA  
record of 11 set by the Lakers in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs also have a chance to eclipse the best postseason  
winning percentage in league history -- .923 by the Philadelphia 
76ers, who went 12-1 in the 1983 playoffs. But it would take 
another four-game sweep to set that record. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks will bring a 6-2 postseason road record into Game 1,  
along with an extraordinary amount of confidence and cockiness that 
helped them overcome devastating injuries to Ewing and Larry 
Johnson during the series against the Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	In their series against Miami, Atlanta and Indiana, the Knicks  
won the first game in their opponent's building each time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a team that has come together in spite of adversity,  
injuries, difficulties and uncertainties, and they clearly decided 
they wanted to win,'' team president Dave Checketts said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio and New York did not play each other in the  
lockout-shortened season, so this will be their first meeting in 
more than 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs swept the season series in 1997-98, back when the  
Knicks were an old, plodding team of veterans who had no idea 
they'd be remade so soon into an athletic, run-and-gun team. 
</P>
<P>
	New York thrived in the conference finals when it was able to  
outrun the old and slow Pacers, and the Spurs will no doubt try to 
keep them in low gear and turn them into a team of jump shooters. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sort of role reversal from the commonly held East vs.  
West theories that hold that the more wide-open style is always 
played by the team located farther left on the map. 
</P>
<P>
	In this wacky season, those old doctrines -- like a lot of  
commonly held beliefs -- have been turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's why we have an NBA finals that just might be  
intriguing enough to make people forget, at least temporarily, that 
there used to be a fella wearing No. 23 who used to make this time 
of year his personal showcase.

<HEADLINE> GOP Boosts Cultural Pollution Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Littleton, Colo., school shooting offers  
evidence of America's growing acceptance of violence, explicit 
language and incivility, and its unwillingness to stand up for 
right and wrong, the congressman who represents the town said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the GOP's weekly radio address, Rep. Tom Tancredo promoted  
legislation aimed at ``cleaning up the pervasive cultural 
pollution'' in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our material wealth has increased, but our cultural wealth has  
been squandered,'' said Tancredo, R-Colo. ``We have to come to 
tolerate ever more outrageous behavior, choosing to look that other 
way rather than appearing to be judgmental.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Americans ``now must turn our resolve to cleaning up the  
pervasive cultural pollution that has seeped into the nation,'' the 
congressman added. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, two students at the suburban Denver high school  
barged into the building with guns and homemade bombs, killing 12 
classmates and a teacher before both the pair committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Tancredo said government has a role to play in reversing the  
process of cultural decay. He touted legislation the House soon 
will consider that would curb children's access to explicit sexual 
or violent movies, video games and other attractions of modern 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The centerpiece of the legislation -- sponsored by Rep. Henry  
Hyde, R-Ill. -- would restrict sexually explicit or violent material 
from being made available to minors, much as current law shelters 
them from obscene material.

<HEADLINE> Cops in Shooting May Be Fired </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- A lawyer for four white police officers  
involved in the controversial shooting death of a 19-year-old black 
woman says the Police Department is preparing to fire them. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers ``are clearly devastated and frustrated'' with the  
decision, said Bill Hadden, who is representing the officers. He 
told the Press-Enterprise of Riverside that his clients are 
``political scapegoats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting of Tyisha Miller at a gas station last Dec. 28  
prompted complaints of excessive force and racial discrimination. 
After being summoned by a distress call, the officers fired 23 
shots at Miller, hitting her 12 times as she sat in her car outside 
the station. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say Miller had a gun on her lap and was unresponsive as  
she sat reclined in the driver's seat. One officer said Miller 
reached for the weapon as officers broke the car's driver's side 
window in an effort to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
	In May, the Riverside County district attorney's office declined  
to file criminal charges against the officers, saying that the 
officers may have made tactical errors but there was no evidence of 
criminal intent. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Justice and the state attorney general's  
office continue to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Jerry Carroll confirmed an internal affairs  
investigation into the case has been completed. He declined to 
discuss the findings but told The Associated Press he agreed with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll has previously defended the officers' actions, saying  
police sometimes must use deadly force to defend themselves. On 
Friday, he reiterated his support for them not to be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers have been on paid administrative leave.  
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Roth, a lawyer for Miller's family, questioned the length  
of time taken in preparing the 4,500-page report. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what we know about the case, there's more than enough  
evidence to support a finding that these officers grossly violated 
proper police procedures,'' Roth said. The family has filed a 
federal civil rights lawsuit against the city and several officers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some family members were pleased with the report but said it  
does not resolve the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a long way from justice, but it's a step forward,'' said  
Miller's aunt, Minerva Butler. ``This is not a celebration. It's 
not even a victory. It's not victory until it's over, when they are 
behind bars.''

<HEADLINE> Pilot Guilty of Conspiracy in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT STEWART, Ga. (AP) -- An Army pilot has been convicted of  
taking his wife and the wife of a co-pilot on an unauthorized 
helicopter ride in the Bahamas last summer that ended in a crash 
that killed both women. 
</P>
<P>
	A military judge spared 38-year-old Chief Warrant Officer David  
Guido from prison time and dismissal from the Army, instead giving 
him a reprimand and a total of $10,000 in fines and forfeited pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido testified that he took his wife on the flight to reward  
her for her support and to share his love of flying with her. 
</P>
<P>
	``She knew how much aviation meant to me,'' he said through  
tears. ``She was an active participant in my career. I have never 
known a more supportive woman. Yes, it clouded my judgment and, 
yes, I paid the price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge, Col. Kenneth Pangburn, on Friday found Guido guilty  
of conspiracy, misappropriating an aircraft and violating an Army 
regulation in the July 6 accident on Grand Exuma Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido's wife, Pam, and Rebecca Riddell, the wife of his  
co-pilot, Chief Warrant Officer Daniel Riddell, were killed when 
the UH-60 Blackhawk went down. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, assigned to Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, were in  
the Bahamas on a drug-fighting mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Guido, of North Haven, Conn., was accused of conspiring with  
Riddell and a technician to sneak his wife and Mrs. Riddell aboard 
the helicopter. The 19 1/2-year Army veteran was acquitted of a charge 
of conduct unbecoming an officer. He faced up to four years in 
prison, forfeiture of all pay and allowances and dismissal from the 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the judge saw the conduct for what it was and I  
appreciate his fairness,'' Guido said after the sentencing, as 
supporters shook hands and wiped away tears of joy. 
</P>
<P>
	Riddell pleaded guilty to wrongful violation of a military order  
and willful dereliction of duty. He still faces charges of 
conspiracy, making a false statement, wrongful appropriation of a 
military aircraft and conduct unbecoming an officer. He is awaiting 
a court-martial June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. William Westgate, who also was on the flight, was seriously  
injured in the crash. No date has been set for his court-martial. 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing in March, one investigator testified the  
accident was caused by a ``pitch-back attack,'' a flying maneuver 
that causes the helicopter to abruptly change directions by 
spinning the tail. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyers have said a mechanical failure was to blame and  
that the pilots did nothing dangerous.

<HEADLINE> Murdoch May Buy Publishing Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch's New York-based News Corp. is  
in discussions to acquire William Morrow &AMP; Co. and Avon Books, it 
was reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The publishing companies, owned by Hearst Corp., will be added  
to Murdoch's HarperCollins group if the deal is concluded, the 
Hollywood Reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcia Horowitz, a Murdoch spokeswoman, had no immediate comment  
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages seeking comment were left at the New York  
City offices of William Morrow and Avon, which were closed 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	News Corp. reportedly has held talks with several mid-sized  
players in its effort to expand its trade book publishing presence. 
The company had been talking with Viacom Inc. about merging 
HarperCollins with Viacom's Simon &AMP; Schuster, but those discussion 
broke off, the Reporter said, citing unidentified sources.

<HEADLINE> More Morningland Cheese Recalled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Missouri producer is expanding its recall of  
cheese that may be contaminated with listeria, a potentially 
life-threatening bacterium. 
</P>
<P>
	Morningland Dairy Farms Inc. of Mountain View, Mo., stopped  
producing and distributing cheese last month after the Food and 
Drug Administration found the bacteria in another type of cheese 
that Morningland had already recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	But Friday, the company also recalled 228 pounds of Morningland  
Dairy Mild Cheddar Cheese that it had produced before the FDA 
action. The cheese is made from unpasteurized milk, and 
contamination showed up in health tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The mild cheddar cheese was sold in plastic bags ranging from  
one-half to 20 pounds, with the code C179 written in ink on the 
label. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria can cause serious, potentially fatal, infections in  
young children, the elderly and people with weak immune systems and 
also can cause miscarriages. Healthy people, however, usually 
suffer short-term symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, abdominal 
pain and fever. 
</P>
<P>
	No illnesses have been reported from the suspect cheese.

<HEADLINE> Olympians Urged To Press for Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Athletes should take the lead in pressing for  
reforms in the Olympics, a former congressional leader who authored 
a critical report of the Salt Lake bribery scandal said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell said he was  
impressed by the path of changes the International Olympic 
Committee was pursuing in the wake of its worst corruption case and 
that ``there is a reasonable chance that something good will 
happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that more time was needed to tell if the IOC's  
actions were long-term changes or ``tinkering at the edges in a 
manner that is deemed sufficient to get past this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The course should be clear by year's end, Mitchell told a group  
of former Olympic athletes gathered to discuss their role in the 
reform process. He urged them to move to the front of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athletes must take the leadership role,'' Mitchell said in the  
keynote address before OATH, which was founded last March at the 
height of the scandal. ``You are in the best position of all to be 
influential because of the prestige your great performances and 
your record gives you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	OATH, for Olympic Advocates Together Honorably, was co-founded  
by Canadian swimmer Mark Tewskbury and businessman George Marsland 
to work for ``systemic reform'' in the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	`The unassailability of the IOC has, unfortunately, become the  
unaccountability of the IOC,'' Marsland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell headed a five-member panel appointed by the U.S.  
Olympic Committee that investigated the Salt Lake scandal and 
concluded that the case resulted from ``an improper culture of 
gift-giving'' entrenched in the system for choosing Olympic host 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said Olympic leaders, including IOC president  
Juan Antonio Samaranch, had ignored signs of corruption long before 
the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	While the USOC quickly adopted the commission's recommendations  
of more openness and accountability, the IOC has moved more slowly, 
and Mitchell has been criticized by some Olympic leaders for trying 
to impose American ways on one of the world's most broadly based 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in April,  
Mitchell said it was much easier for the USOC to quickly adopt 
reforms because the IOC had to do so much more. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we recommended to the USOC was to take two aspirin and go  
to bed,'' he said. ``What we recommended to the IOC was brain 
surgery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was why the focus must swing back to the stars of the  
games, Mitchell said, and why their participation was critical in 
assuring that the scandal of Salt Lake did not recur. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think most IOC members care much what I say,''  
Mitchell said at a luncheon attended by more than two dozen former 
Olympic competitors. ``I think the IOC will care very much what you 
say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a news conference, the former Senate leader and head  
of the panel that brokered peace in Northern Ireland said the 
athletes -- who have been among the loudest critics of the scandal -- 
must use personal persuasion to state their case. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no substitute for making a direct personal case on  
the merits,'' he said. ``And there is no one (than the athletes) 
with a higher standing with the public. They are in a unique 
position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the Mitchell commission's recommendations that the IOC  
quickly adopted was agreeing to include athletes as members, with 
the ranks filled by direct election of their peers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell spent much of the lunch talking with Johan Olav Koss,  
an Olympic speedskating champion and vocal critic of IOC 
leadership, who said he was pleased with initial steps taken by IOC 
2000, the 80-member task force that will draw up reforms. Koss is 
an athlete representative on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell said he was encouraged by Koss' comments.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a process. I think it is open,'' he said. ``I  
think there is a reasonable chance that something good will 
happen.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Rallies Reform Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura, the Reform Party's  
only statewide officer holder, told party activists at the state 
convention today to work hard and be patient. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention was the first since Ventura's stunning victory  
last November, and attendance of more than 200 delegates doubled 
the turnout at the 1998 convention. Still, the party's future 
viability is far from secure. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has major party status, making it eligible for public  
subsidies. But to maintain that, the party's presidential or U.S. 
Senate candidate must receive at least 5 percent of the vote next 
year. No strong candidate has emerged for either office. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders are looking to the state's 201 legislative seats,  
which are all up for re-election next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura, the former professional wrestler and first Reform Party  
candidate in the nation to win a statewide election, told activists 
to send him company at the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't sit on our laurels of winning governor. We can't do  
that. Frankly, I'll tell you why: I'm lonesome,'' Ventura said.

<HEADLINE> Statistics on Domestic Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	National statistics on domestic violence trends are scarce, but  
some are available. The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports: 
</P>
<P>
	--In 1996, just over 1,800 murders were attributable to intimates  
-- meaning current or former spouses, boyfriends or girlfriends. 
Nearly three in four had a female victim. 
</P>
<P>
	--About 30 percent of women who are murdered are killed by  
intimates. 
</P>
<P>
	--As overall crime has declined, the number of female victims of  
non-lethal intimate violence has declined. In 1996, about 840,000 
women were raped, assaulted or robbed, down from 1.1 million in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	--About half of incidents experienced by women are reported to  
police. Those who do not report most commonly say that they thought 
it was a personal matter, feared retaliation or felt police wold 
not be able to help. 
</P>
<P>
	--Nearly four in 10 offenders sentenced to jail for violence  
against a spouse, boyfriend or girlfriend had a restraining order 
against them when the committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	More information is often available at the state level, and it  
varies widely: 
</P>
<P>
	--In West Virginia, reports of domestic violence grew 3.3 percent  
in 1997, though advocates suggest that may be a function of better 
reporting. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres finally lost their  
home-ice magic with the 2-1 loss to the Dallas Stars in the Stanley 
Cup finals on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres had been 7-0 in the playoffs at the Marine Midland  
Arena, one short of the club record set by the 1975 team. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo's last playoff loss at home came in last year's  
conference finals against the Washington Capitals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGH TIMES:* Joe Nieuwendyk's two goals for Dallas marked his  
third multi-goal game of the playoffs and gave him an NHL-high 11 
for the postseason. He passed teammate Jamie Langenbrunner, who has 
10. 
</P>
<P>
	It was also a career high in playoff goals for Nieuwendyk, who  
scored 10 for Calgary in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEVASTATING DEFENSE:* In holding the Sabres to 12 shots  
Saturday night, the Stars broke a club playoff record. The Stars 
established that record this year when they held Ottawa to 15 shots 
in their first game of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCOREBOARD-WATCHING:* The fans really came out for Saturday  
night's Stanley Cup finals game -- and not only at the Marine 
Midland Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	With a sellout crowd of 18,595 at the Sabres' arena, a crowd of  
some 15,000 showed up at Dunn Tire Park just up the street to watch 
the game on a 20-by-40-foot video screen. The stadium is the home 
of the Buffalo Bisons of the International League. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IGNITING THE CROWD:* Dallas Stars rookie Jon Sim had the crowd  
all over him -- and the game hadn't even started yet. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Stars finished their pregame warmup on Saturday night,  
Sim was the last player coming off the ice when he committed a 
no-no: He shot the puck into the Sabres' net. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd booed, naturally.  
</P>
<P>
	Such actions in the past have sparked all-out brawls between NHL  
teams before games. Fortunately for Sim, no one else was on the 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOUBLE DUTY:* Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals in Buffalo had  
at least one thing that Games 1 and 2 didn't have in Dallas -- the 
Canadian national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
	Ingrid Smolinska, the fiance of Sabres forward Miroslav Satan,  
sang both the Canadian and American anthems before Saturday night's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	``O, Canada'' is sung regularly at Sabres games because a  
significant percentage of season ticket-holders are from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OFFICIALLY SPEAKING:* Terry Gregson and Don Koharski were the  
referees and Ray Scapinello and Jay Sharrers were the linesmen for 
Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SEEING COLORS:* The Marine Midland Arena was a sea of red,  
white and blue Saturday night. No, it had nothing at all to do with 
the American flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans all received red T-Shirts as they came through the  
turnstiles. The white came from the pom-poms left for them on the 
blue seats. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STICKY SITUATION:* Dominik Hasek has really been sticking it to  
the Dallas Stars. Ask coach Ken Hitchcock, who is really angry over 
the way the Buffalo Sabres goaltender drops his stick on the ice 
during play around his net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a real problem with that because he uses it perfectly  
as a stopper,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's bothered a lot of coaches in 
the league because we don't allow hockey players to play like that, 
so why should the goaltender play like that? 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only does the stick get dropped but it gets strategically  
placed. I don't like it if there's a double set of standards for 
people. That goal stick, to me if it goes outside that blue area, 
we should just shoot it into the stands.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE INJURY FACTOR:* Sabres coach Lindy Ruff was talking about  
how injuries are so much a part of hockey. That goes double late in 
the season when your team is in the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if you actually had the count of injuries, the number  
would be unbelievable,'' Ruff said, then without skipping a beat 
added, ``... although our team is completely healthy right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That got a chuckle from the press, which is well aware of how  
hockey teams tend to hide the kind of injuries they have as a 
tactical advantage. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT SO HANDY:* Mike Modano's wrist injury might affect his game  
somewhat, but he will be no worse than any of the other Dallas 
Stars, according to coach Ken Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players put it best,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's about time  
he feels like the rest of them -- average hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SMALL MARKET SALVO:* With the Buffalo Sabres in the finals,  
coach Lindy Ruff thinks they have struck a blow for small-market 
teams in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bodes well,'' Ruff said. ``Parity is at a premium. The gap  
between the superstars and the really good players is not that big. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have some good players in the system, you can build a  
good team. Spend your money on a few good players -- our goalie 
(Dominik Hasek) is certainly worth it -- and build around him.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HEATING UP:* The finals figure to become rougher as they go on,  
particularly if the Dallas Stars continue to target Buffalo goalie 
Dominik Hasek. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Buffalo's Jay McKee: ``There's an unwritten rule that you  
wouldn't intentionally run another team's goalie, but we're going 
to drive to the net hard. If we feel they're intentionally running 
over Dominik, then we'll just drive to the net harder and try to 
keep it fair. 
</P>
<P>
	``But if we get hauled down, then I guess we'll just end up  
going through (Stars goalie Ed) Belfour.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Alex Solis, sworn in as an American  
citizen on Thursday, celebrated Friday by riding four winners at 
Hollywood Park, including Aviate in the feature race. 
</P>
<P>
	Solis, a 35-year-old native of Panama, also won with Tanaasa in  
the second race, Bacavi in the fourth and Rock Hound in the fifth 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviate, the 2-5 favorite, took the lead midway through the  
stretch in beating Nausicaa by three lengths in the $51,352 
allowance feature for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aviate, who carried 119 pounds, covered 1 1-16 miles on turf in  
1:41 1-5 and paid $2.80 and $2.10. There was no show betting 
because only four fillies competed. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the third in 10 lifetime starts for Aviate and  
was worth $31,440, increasing the career earnings of the 
Kentucky-bred daughter of Lord Avie to $169,842. 
</P>
<P>
	Nausicaa, ridden by Brice Blanc and carrying 117 pounds, crossed  
the finish line 3 1/2 lengths in front of Courtesan and returned

<HEADLINE> Belle Returns to Orioles' Lineup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Albert Belle, benched for one game after a  
shouting match with Baltimore manager Ray Miller, returned to the 
Orioles lineup for Saturday's game against the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle didn't play Friday night, breaking his streak of 392  
consecutive games played. He had taken over the longest active 
streak in the majors after teammate Cal Ripken voluntarily sat down 
late last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, who has been suspended six times during his troubled  
career, clashed with Miller after failing to run out a ninth-inning 
grounder during Wednesday's 4-2 victory at Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In the bottom of the inning, Miller replaced Belle in the  
outfield with Rich Amaral, a move the manager said he planned to 
make anyway. But Belle was unaware of the change until he was on 
his way to the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
	After he jogged back to the dugout, TV cameras caught an  
exchange of profanities between Miller and Belle. The outfielder 
had to be restrained by teammate Jeff Reboulet. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller refused to say he was disciplining Belle by keeping him  
on the bench for Friday's game, which the Orioles won 6-2. Belle's 
replacement, Jeff Conine, went 3-for-5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albert Belle got the day off. That was my choice,'' Miller  
said. ``Any other reflection or matters about that subject will be 
handled internally. Let's leave it that way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle, batting cleanup, was booed loudly by the Turner Field  
crowd when he came up in the first inning Saturday. He responded 
with a single to right and scored on Will Clark's two-run homer, 
giving the Orioles a 4-0 lead.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Wildfire Scorches 4,470 Acres </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Fire crews in Arizona stopped the spread today of a 4,470-acre  
wildfire that forced 100 families to evacuate their homes on the 
Fort Apache Indian Reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	About 800 firefighters formed a preliminary containment line  
around the blaze north of Whiteriver, Ariz., about 130 miles 
northeast of Phoenix, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Bob Dyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added: ``When the winds come up today, we're  
anticipating spot fires across the line. Every ember that we've got 
is burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fire, which was sparked Friday, has charred acres of pine  
trees and heavy brush. Twelve buildings, including some homes, have 
been destroyed, Dyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 300 evacuees were staying in two shelters. Officials were  
worried that heavy smoke could cause breathing problems for some 
people, including the elderly, Dyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sucking lots of smoke in all the valleys,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a wildfire ignited by lightning on June 3 had burned  
800 acres of Ponderosa pine near the north rim of the Grand Canyon 
by late Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the fire had spread slowly to a mile east of the  
Mount Logan Wilderness Area but would be allowed to burn itself 
out.

<HEADLINE> Supremacist Wanted Everyone Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- A white supremacist arrested after buying  
hand grenades from an undercover agent said he wanted to send mail 
bombs to Washington and Montgomery, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Scott Gilliam said he didn't want to be like the  
Unabomber, who killed three person and wounded several others, a 
federal agent testified at a federal court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to kill everybody,'' David Pasqualotto, a special  
agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate indication what agencies or people might  
have been targeted in the national and state capital cities. An ATF 
representative did not immediately return calls for comment 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilliam, 27, was charged with possessing an unregistered firearm  
found at his home in Foley along with what agents said was 
apparently a silencer. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Gary Arm said at the hearing that Gilliam  
legally owned the firearm and has no criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal magistrate ordered him held pending the results of a  
psychological evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Gilliam, could face six or seven years in prison,  
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Bordenkircher. No charges were 
immediately filed in connection with the grenade purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Pasqualotto testified that Gilliam met with him Thursday,  
arriving with a loaded, cocked .45-caliber pistol on his hip and 
his 20-month-old son in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he wasn't quite right,'' Pasqualotto said.  
</P>
<P>
	The investigation started three weeks earlier when Gilliam  
contacted a man about obtaining C4 high explosive, Pasqualotto 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Gilliam also told the informant someone should kill the  
FBI sniper who killed the wife of white supremacist Randy weaver 
during an 11-day standoff in 1992 at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, along with 
civil rights lawyer Morris Dees of the Montgomery-based Southern 
Poverty Law Center.

<HEADLINE> Marla Maples' Publicist Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A former publicist for Marla Maples was  
sentenced Friday to 4 1/2 years in prison for burglarizing her 
apartment and taking pajamas, pantyhose and undergarments. 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Jones, 55, who represented himself, must serve 18 months  
before he is eligible for parole. He was given until Tuesday to 
surrender and was expected to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was caught on videotape going through Maples' closets and  
rooms on July 13, 1992, while she was out. Maples, who recently 
agreed to a divorce settlement from Donald Trump, barely remembered 
the items recovered from Jones' office.

<HEADLINE> Hastert Rises From Back Benches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sam Rayburn was Mr. Speaker, the legendary  
leader a congressman crossed at his own risk. To get along, go 
along, was his firm advice. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Cannon ruled as speaker with the power to give and take  
committee chairmanships and personally block legislation, until the 
House rebelled in 1910. 
</P>
<P>
	Tip O'Neill was a nationally known face, his leadership as  
speaker shaped by long-practiced skills as a bargainer and 
vote-counter. 
</P>
<P>
	Newt Gingrich was a fierce politician, leader and symbol of the  
Republican rise to House control after 40 years, then undone by 
his, and their, errors. 
</P>
<P>
	J. Dennis Hastert is none of the above.  
</P>
<P>
	He is not the first low-profile speaker of the House; there have  
been many more little-known than famed ones. But none of them 
vaulted from the ranks to the No. 1 job as suddenly as he. A GOP 
House poll shows that among Republicans beyond the Beltway, 
Hastert's deputies are better known than he is. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems Hastert faces would strain even a speaker with  
powers beyond the persuasion he is using to try to make the GOP 
majority work like one. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans outnumber Democrats 223-211 in the House, and the  
one independent usually votes with the Democrats. Since just six 
GOP defections can deadlock the House, Hastert's agenda of 
challenges includes sometimes rebellious conservatives, moderates 
worried about their budget priorities, spending limits that would 
compel politically unpopular cuts, and a commitment to reduce taxes 
in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's to deal with the budget, the 13 appropriations bills  
that are the only ones Congress is legally required to pass each 
year. It doesn't always happen; undone bills get lumped into 
resolutions to keep the government financed. In 1998, President 
Clinton was able to force some of his spending priorities onto the 
Republican Congress in those circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's Republicans don't want last year's outcome. So  
Hastert and GOP floor leaders tried to begin passing appropriations 
bills early, planning to have two done before Memorial Day. 
Instead, they ran into a slowdown by conservatives demanding 
spending cuts and had to shelve both. 
</P>
<P>
	That led to Hastert's unity lecture to House Republicans on  
Tuesday. The speaker told them that they needed to get behind the 
agenda set by their leaders or risk losing control of the House for 
lack of a GOP record on which to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some days you have to give your leadership the benefit of the  
doubt and just follow,'' Hastert said. ``That is the difference 
between a majority mentality and a minority mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich might have yelled at them. He once dismissed his GOP  
detractors as ``unruly children,'' and stupid. Hastert said at the 
start that wasn't his style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always try to talk with reason and straightforward, as  
honest as possible,'' the Illinois congressman said when he was 
asked whether he'd laid down the law at the GOP conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Republicans emerged united. But details are yet to come  
on just how to handle appropriations within a $538 billion ceiling 
for spending set by the appropriations bills. That does not include 
Social Security, other guaranteed benefit programs and interest on 
the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert's plan is said to involve shifting about $7 billion in  
spending among appropriations bills to make them all palatable 
enough to pass. ``We're standing together and we're united,'' the 
speaker said, to stay within the spending limits, present spending 
that would dip into Social Security funds, and try to cut taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	It may not work, but if it doesn't, and Republicans can hold  
their lines, they could do better politically than in earlier 
budget disputes with Clinton, who has vetoed appropriations bills 
that didn't meet his priorities and succeeded in forcing 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, party unity is more easily pledged than held, when the  
issues move from goals to specifics, on spending and on other 
measures. The House is to debate gun control legislation this week. 
Hastert favors a version Democrats and GOP moderates say is too 
weak, and some other Republican leaders oppose outright.

<HEADLINE> Running Stag Wins at Belmont </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Running Stag exploded down the stretch for a 7 1/4  
length victory in the 111th running of the $350,000 Brooklyn 
Handicap on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	His time of 1:46:1 tied the fastest in the thirty previous  
runnings of the race at nine furlongs, posted by Formal Gold in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Diamond was a distant second in the eight horse field  
another 2 1/4 lengths in front of Sir Bear, the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the first in four starts this year for the  
5-year-old horse. 
</P>
<P>
	Running Stag, ridden by Shane Sellers, earned $210,000 for  
Richard J. Cohen and returned $9.90,$5.60 and $3.20. Deputy Diamond 
paid $6.30 and $3.40 and Sir Bear was $2.40 to show.

<HEADLINE> Fan Interferes at College Series </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Some of the biggest playmakers in Friday  
night's game between Miami and Rice weren't even wearing a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of teen-age fans leaned over the left field wall to grab  
a ball that appeared to be within the playing field. The youths, 
seated in the general admission section at Rosenblatt Stadium, 
juggled the ball before it landed in the hands of fan Casey 
Culhane. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ruled a two-run home run for Miami's Bobby Hill, pulling  
the Hurricanes within 4-2 in the bottom of the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw it coming and thought, `I've got to catch it,''' Culhane  
said. ``It was instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The play was somewhat reminiscent of the 1996 American League  
championship series, when a young fan grabbed an 11th-inning home 
run by Bernie Williams and the New York Yankees got a 5-4 victory 
over Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Maier, 12, reached over the wall and snagged a ball that  
was about to be caught by Tony Tarasco. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, Rice left fielder Charles Williams didn't have a  
play on Hill's fly but he was moving over to prepare for the carom 
when Culhane reached over and caught it. Television replays showed 
the interference. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers wouldn't tell their ages but said they were from  
Lincoln, about 60 miles west of Omaha. They said they all play 
amateur baseball but declined to disclose which high school or 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the teen-agers called friends on his cellular phone after  
the catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was calling some buddies back home to see if they saw it on  
TV,'' Donny Wyar said. 
</P>
<P>
	A short time later, they were escorted away by stadium security  
officers and a sheriff's deputy. Kevin Mayer, supervisor of stadium 
security, said protocol requires fans be removed for interference 
regardless of the umpire's call. 
</P>
<P>
	As they left, the teens said they were rooting for the Owls.  
</P>
<P>
	``Give Rice our apologies,'' said Andy Newton, who had thrown  
the ball back on the field after Culhane handed it to him. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOLLYWOOD ON THE DIAMOND:* The Titans made the College World  
Series, and Kevin Costner will come. 
</P>
<P>
	Cal State-Fullerton sports information director Mel Franks said  
the actor was scheduled to fly into Omaha on Saturday for the 
Titans' game against Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	Costner, a Cal State-Fullerton alum, attended the series in 1995  
when the Titans won the championship. He was expected to arrive 
Saturday by private jet. 
</P>
<P>
	Franks said the star of ``Bull Durham,'' ``Field of Dreams,''  
``Dances With Wolves'' and ``Waterworld'' was hoping for just one 
thing in Omaha -- a game of catch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to be in the dugout but the NCAA said no,'' Franks  
said. ``He's bringing his glove.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Costner's agent, Steven Rivers, confirmed late Friday that  
Costner would attend. Franks said Costner hoped to participate in 
infield or batting practice before Saturday's game between the 
Titans and Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they'd let him, he'd ride on the bus with them and take  
(batting practice) and everything,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIGHLIGHT REEL:* Call it the consequences of making the play.  
</P>
<P>
	Jason Van Arkel, 23, suffered a bruised knee when he fell  
backward over the left field wall while trying to keep a beach ball 
from floating onto the field at Rosenblatt Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a hero,'' said Steve Lefeber, 42, of Omaha, another fan  
in the left field bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Arkel was helped off the field by grounds crew members but  
returned a short time later to cheers and a brief ovation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how I'm a hero,'' he said sheepishly. ``I just  
fell over the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started to fall headfirst, and I just grabbed the wall and  
landed on my knee,'' said Van Arkel, an overnight news producer for 
an Omaha radio station. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Arkel said he has been coming to the College World Series  
for years, but never with such an eventful day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was afraid they'd kick me out,'' he said. ``But they let me  
back in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One bystander called the episode ``the most exciting part'' of  
the nearly four-hour game. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BIG RED MACHINE:* There's only one thing that could push aside  
coverage of the College World Series in Omaha: Nebraska Cornhuskers 
football. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's sports section of the Omaha World-Herald, the  
College World Series and Stanley Cup finals competed with news 
about the recovery of injured Nebraska quarterback Bobby Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe missed most of last season with a torn knee ligament  
and had surgery in December. He rejoined his teammates this week 
during informal offseason workouts and continues to do 
rehabilitation work. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe wore no pads and didn't even participate in every  
exercise. But it was a start -- and it was section-front news in 
football-crazed Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *PLAYING TAG:* Oklahoma State had a painful first day -- in more  
ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Josh Holliday was hit twice by pitches in the Cowboys' 11-2 loss  
to Alabama. That tied a College World Series record and made 
Holliday the 18th player in CWS history to be hit twice in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinch-hitter Chris Becerra also was hit by a pitch, bringing  
Oklahoma State's season total to 96. The previous school record was 
84 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *EVERYTHING'S POLITICAL:* Rep. Lee Terry, R-Neb., used the start  
of the College World Series to increase his political profile, 
holding a fund-raiser at the adjacent Henry Doorly Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
	The event was expected to raise about $100,000 for the National  
Republican Congressional Committee, committee spokeswoman Jill 
Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Republican congressmen were scheduled to attend a  
reception and Friday's games, including Rep. John Thune of South 
Dakota, Nebraska Reps. Doug Bereuter and Bill Barrett and Rep. 
Frank Lucas of Oklahoma -- whose Oklahoma State Cowboys played 
Alabama in the series opener. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder said it is not uncommon for politicians to  
``piggyback'' such fund-raising events onto a sports event like the 
College World Series or the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fun,'' she said. ``And it's not the same old rubber  
chicken dinner.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ROLL TIDE:* Alabama shortstop Andy Phillips extended his  
hitting streak to 34 games Friday, breaking a tie with Louisiana 
State's Todd Walker for the Southeastern Conference record. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips singled to left in the third inning against Oklahoma  
State. He then stole second base, but was stranded there. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAMP OF APPROVAL:* The U.S. Postal Service has added its 33  
cents to the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office opened a temporary branch just outside  
Rosenblatt Stadium that will be open during the series. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office is across the street from the community of  
recreational vehicles known as ``Dingerville.'' The Postal Service 
said customers could buy special pictorial stamps, envelopes, 
regular stamps and other items.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Deal Plesac to Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dan Plesac, having the worst season of his  
13-year career, was traded by the Toronto Blue Jays to the Arizona 
Diamondbacks on Saturday for shortstop Tony Batista and 
right-hander John Frascatore. 
</P>
<P>
	Plesac, 37, who ranks 25th in major league history with 788  
appearances, was 0-3 with an 8.34 ERA in 30 games for the Blue 
Jays. He allowed a run in one inning Friday against Philadelphia 
after entering Toronto's game against the Mets in the 14th inning 
Wednesday and giving up a game-winning single to Rey Ordonez. 
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander appeared in a career-high 78 games in 1998, his  
third consecutive season with 70 or more games. Plesac is 
153-for-216 in career save situations (.708). 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays announced the deal shortly before their game  
Saturday night against the Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Batista, 25, became Arizona's starting shortstop last season  
when Jay Bell moved to second base. However, Batista had lost the 
full-time starting job in recent weeks and had been platooned at 
the position with Andy Fox. Batista was batting .257 with five home 
runs and 21 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
	Batista was Arizona's 14th pick, and the 27th choice overall, in  
last year's expansion draft from the Oakland A's. His departure 
leaves only six of the 35 players selected by the Diamondbacks in 
the expansion draft still on the Arizona roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Frascatore, obtained by the Diamondbacks this spring in a trade  
with St. Louis, was 1-4 with a 4.09 ERA in 26 relief appearances 
for Arizona. He gave up a two-run homer in the ninth inning of the 
Diamondbacks' 12-2 victory over Anaheim on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks were willing to part with a young talent like  
Batista because of a dire need to shore up its shaky bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little bit of a risk, but sometimes you have to take a  
risk,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said in Anaheim, where the 
Diamondbacks were playing the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	Plesac will join Greg Swindell as left-handers in the Arizona  
bullpen. The Diamondbacks, who lead the NL West, have blown 10 of 
21 save situations but there was no indication they look upon 
Plesac as a full-time closer. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said Fox, who played seven positions for Arizona last  
season, would be the regular shortstop, with Hanley Frias playing 
some at that position. Frias started at shortstop Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said the Diamondbacks do not want to move Bell back to  
shortstop because they believe Bell's shift is at least partly 
responsible for his strong season. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Womack, who played second base in Pittsburgh before being  
traded to Arizona this year, also is an option at shortstop, 
Showalter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks believe their shortstop of the future is Danny  
Klassen, currently with Triple-A Tucson.

<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Creighton University dental students Eric  
Elmquist and Chad Araki did their best Saturday to promote clean 
mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	Elmquist, from St. Peter, Minn., and Araki of Ewa Beach, Hawaii,  
stood on the crowded concourse below the Rosenblatt Stadium stands, 
passing out brochures about the dangers of smokeless tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we're making a difference,'' Araki said. ``A lot of  
people only associate tobacco with smoking. They need to be aware 
of the dangers of mouth, esophageal and stomach cancer, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A non-profit group, the National Spit Tobacco Education Program,  
set up the booth across from concession stands and near restrooms. 
The booth featured posters of decayed mouths and other tales 
intended to discourage use of smokeless tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to know about it,'' said passer-by Jerry Luke, 46,  
a banker from Atlantic, Iowa. ``Everybody hears about the 
importance of quitting smoking and they might think chewing is 
OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chewing tobacco is banned in the minor leagues and college  
baseball, although Florida State sports information director Rob 
Wilson said about two or three Seminoles use it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It used to be, 10 years ago or so, about 33 of the 35 players  
on a college baseball roster used it,'' Wilson said. ``Now, it's 
the other way around. Maybe just a couple of guys on a team do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles outfielder Chris Smith said he doesn't touch the  
stuff. As he autographed baseballs for elementary school-age fans, 
he was asked if he had any advice about chewing tobacco for 
youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	``You won't like the taste, so don't even try it,'' Smith said.  
``It's a bad habit. It's disgusting. It looks gross. Why would 
anyone want to put that stuff in their mouth?'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AGGIE-FRIENDLY CROWD:* Among the 19,745 fans who filled the  
stadium for the afternoon game was a legion of Texas A&AMP;M 
supporters. Maroon T-shirts and caps littered the stands. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans of the Aggies sat behind the A&AMP;M dugout, and they made  
themselves known early. Loud cheers went up when Steven Truitt led 
off the top of the second with a double and later scored on a 
single by Greg Porter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas A&AMP;M fans, famous for the coordinated cheers that shake  
the Kyle Field press box on football Saturdays, even tried to start 
the wave in the third. Moments later, they cheered again when Shawn 
Schumacher homered to right. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NICE HAIR, DUDE:* During Thursday's pre-series news conference  
featuring coaches from all eight teams, Florida State's Mike Martin 
said left-hander Mike DiBlasi was the team oddball. 
</P>
<P>
	Now we know why. When the Seminoles lined up on the third-base  
line for the national anthem, DeBlasi removed his cap to reveal red 
and gold streaks through his short hair. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ANOTHER ONE FOR JENNINGS:* For the second time this week,  
Baylor pitcher and designated hitter Justin Jennings won a player 
of the year award. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, it was the Dick Howser Trophy selected by the  
National Collegiate Baseball Writers Association. On Thursday, 
Jennings was awarded by Baseball America magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous winners of the Howser Trophy have included Robin  
Ventura (Oklahoma State, 1988), Jason Varitek (Georgia Tech, 1994), 
Todd Helton (Tennessee, 1995), Kris Benson (Clemson, 1996) and J.D. 
Drew (Florida State, 1997). 
</P>
<P>
	Jennings was taken by the Colorado Rockies as a pitcher with the  
16th selection of this month's amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season at Baylor, Jennings hit .386 with 17 home runs and  
68 RBIs and led the Big 12 with a 13-2 record on the mound. He also 
had 172 strikeouts in 146 2-3 innings with a 2.58 ERA.

<HEADLINE> Intersex Mice Found at Calif. Refuge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS BANOS, Calif. (AP) -- Something strange is happening to the  
rodents at a Northern California wildlife area where thousands of 
birds were poisoned by toxic runoff from farms in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Both male and female reproductive organs were found in one-third  
of the 87 field mice, house mice, harvest mice and California voles 
trapped last year on land that once collected toxic runoff at the 
Kesterson National Wildlife Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 percent of rodents trapped there showed such  
characteristics in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``The number of intersex mammals was a surprising finding to  
everybody,'' said Michael Delamore, chief of the U.S. Bureau of 
Reclamation's drainage program in Fresno. ``We're not sure what it 
means, because it's new, and the phenomenon hasn't been widely 
reported.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Technically, the rodents seem to be pseudo-hermaphroditic,  
according to biologist Gary Santolo, who led the investigation. 
They appear to be males from the outside, and lack a vagina, but 
have a fully developed set of female organs internally. 
</P>
<P>
	Some scientists say something in the environment is causing the  
outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fair to say that if it happened in four species and  
happened suddenly, it's indicative of an environmental cause of 
some sort,'' said Dr. Richard Auchus, an endocrinologist at the 
University of California at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Animals in the area have been monitored yearly since an  
investigation in 1985 revealed that selenium, a byproduct of 
agricultural runoff, was killing or deforming thousands of birds. 
</P>
<P>
	Massive quantities of selenium, pesticides and other toxic  
chemicals were being deposited in the refuge in ponds that served 
as a sump for farm runoff. The ponds have since been closed and 
filled in at a cost of $50 million. The refuge no longer 
encompasses the ponds. 
</P>
<P>
	Selenium is not believed to be the cause of the hermaphroditic  
rodents. All of them had elevated levels of the element in their 
livers, but studies of selenium's effect on lab mice have not 
induced similar deformities.

<HEADLINE> GOP Hopefuls Criticize Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Elizabeth Dole pledged more aid for  
farmers and offered ``courageous conservatism,'' while Lamar 
Alexander said President Clinton ``has been diddling'' while 
farmers went broke. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Rep. John Kasich of Ohio touted his work as head of the  
House Budget Committee in the busiest political weekend of the 
emerging campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio descended Saturday on the Iowa State Fairgrounds to  
talk farming with shirt-sleeved producers at the World Pork Expo, 
around a stage normally used for talent contests. 
</P>
<P>
	At the fairgrounds, Mrs. Dole touted a 10-point farm program  
that would cut taxes, boost exports and help struggling livestock 
producers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next president, whoever she may be, must stabilize the  
farm economy by exercising leadership to expand domestic markets 
and increasing exports,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Iowa produces a quarter of the nation's hogs and has suffered  
from low commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivals of GOP front-runner George W. Bush have attacked the  
Texas governor for being vague on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that people in Iowa want straight talk,'' said Mrs.  
Dole, the closest contender to Bush in most polling. ``I think they 
want people with the courage of their convictions. That's what I 
call courageous conservatism and that's what I'm bringing to the 
table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She rejected suggestions she was taking a shot at Bush, who  
describes himself as a ``compassionate conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm speaking for Elizabeth Dole,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	All the contenders sought to play on the down-home flavor of the  
Pork Expo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen so much pork since the highway bill passed  
Congress last year,'' Kasich said. ``The values that are practiced 
every day on the American farm are very special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander also focused on farming, arguing he would boost export  
subsidies, farm research and the use of ethanol-blended fuels. 
Clinton got most of his fire, 
</P>
<P>
	``While Bill Clinton has been diddling and Al Gore has been  
cheerleading, more farmers have been going out of business than 
during the farm crisis of the 1980s,'' Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Bush making his initial campaign foray into the state, a  
huge media crush descended on the state and a string of candidates 
sought to catch some of that attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning separately, a fourth Republican, conservative  
activist Gary Bauer, warned Democrats will pay a political price 
because of military weaknesses exposed in the Balkan bombing 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer said Friday night that though the Balkan bombing campaign  
had success, it underscored a shortage of weaponry because of 
Clinton's budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the course of that war he inadvertently elevated what is  
going to be a major issue in 2000,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued Saturday from Louisiana, he urged Congress  
to deny China normal trade relations with the United States and 
said the Clinton administration's China policy has been ``an utter 
disaster.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes Patients Rights Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his push Saturday  
for Congress to pass legislation guaranteeing rights for medical 
patients, and said GOP proposals to reform managed care were ``a 
patients' bill of rights in name only.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton used his first weekly radio address since the end of  
NATO bombing in Kosovo to highlight the safeguards he wants as part 
of a package of protections for the more than half of all Americans 
enrolled in managed-care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must do more to make sure that when health care plans cut  
costs, they don't cut quality, and that the bottom line never 
becomes more important than patients' needs,'' the president said 
in remarks taped Friday for broadcast Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants legislation that would ensure patients have access  
to health care specialists and emergency room services, and protect 
them from switching doctors in the midst of treatment.

<P>
	The most controversial -- and most expensive -- provision that  
Democrats are pushing would give patients the right to sue health 
plans and collect damages when treatment is withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said the Democratic measures is too expensive  
and could lead employers to drop coverage. Senate Republicans have 
their own legislation on health maintenance organizations that 
would cost less but would cover fewer Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	While pleased by GOP support for the issue and a pledge by  
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to bring managed-care 
legislation to a vote this summer, Clinton said the Republican 
proposals were inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Republican leadership's legislation falls far short of  
providing American families the protection they need in a changing 
health care system,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton listed protections not in various GOP measures,  
including guaranteed access to specialists and recourse against 
health plans that provide poor-quality care. Republican HMO 
legislation also would exclude tens of millions of Americans from 
protections, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``A patients' bill of rights that doesn't provide these  
important protections is a patients' bill of rights in name only, 
and our people deserve better,'' the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton directed health plans used by federal  
employees and their families to implement the patients' bill of 
rights. And in April, he touted figures showing that this action is 
costing less than $10 per person per year.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Fever Strikes Buffalo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Not since the Buffalo Bills earned their  
fourth consecutive Super Bowl trip in 1994 have fans in these parts 
been so pumped, looking again for that elusive major sports 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that the Buffalo Sabres' opponent in the Stanley  
Cup finals is the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas is the home of America's Team in football, the dreaded  
Cowboys who broke Buffalo's heart not once, but twice, with 
consecutive Super Bowl victories in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Worse yet, the Stars, the National Hockey League's best  
regular-season team, went into the finals heavily favored. The 
best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals are tied at one game each, with 
Game 3 to be played here tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	If a Buffalo team falls again to a Dallas team, Buffalo fan Bob  
Young said, ``I don't want to hear about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Stanley Cup win could boost the psyche of a city that's been  
dealt blow after blow from the outside world over its sports 
failures, harsh winters and economic hardships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be worse. We could live in Buffalo,'' columnist Woody  
Paige wrote in The Denver Post after the Colorado Avalanche lost to 
the Stars. He said Buffalo would be worse ``for obvious reasons'' 
and because Buffalo has never won a Super Bowl, an NBA 
championship, a World Series or a Stanley Cup ``and likely won't 
again this season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo falls more than Niagara,'' he declared.  
</P>
<P>
	Arun Jain, a marketing professor at the University at Buffalo,  
said an NHL championship would be good for the community. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Stanley Cup championship would give Buffalo a positive  
image; then, by inference, people would begin to think that there 
is something special about the city,'' Jain said. ``After they take 
a longer look at Buffalo, they'll learn that the city has a lot to 
offer beyond professional sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, it would make the city's long-suffering fans feel better.  
</P>
<P>
	``I am the consummate loser,'' said Dave Pietrowski, a Sabres  
and Bills season-ticket holder. ``I went to Syracuse University. 
I've been to two Final Fours, a Sugar Bowl, four Super Bowls, and 
my team has never won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Buffalo Bills quarterback Jim Kelly, who led his team to  
all those Super Bowls, is hoping the Sabres win. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are always ragging on the Bills and the people of  
Buffalo about those Super Bowls,'' he said. ``Maybe this will shut 
some people up.''

<HEADLINE>  Brewers Retire Molitor's No. 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Paul Molitor, who spent the first 15 years of  
his career with Milwaukee, saw his No. 4 uniform retired by the 
Brewers on Friday night to fans' cheers of ``Paulie, Paulie, 
Paulie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only other Brewers to have their jerseys retired are Hank  
Aaron (44), Robin Yount (19) and Rollie Fingers (34). 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor was greeted with a long standing ovation and told the  
crowd that if elected to the Hall of Fame, ``I'll be proud to go in 
as a Brewer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been embraced by the fans here, and I want to thank you  
from the bottom of my heart for that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 21-year career, which ended last season, Molitor hit .306  
with 3,319 hits, eighth on the career list. He was a five-time 
All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor was with the Brewers from 1978-92. He is now a part-time  
broadcaster for the Minnesota Twins but said he would like to get 
more involved in ``terms of teaching or shaping'' young players for 
a team. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there was some ill feeling when he left the Brewers as  
a free agent in 1993, and again in 1996 when he chose to play for 
the Twins instead of returning to Milwaukee, Molitor said he could 
return to the Brewers one day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be foolish to close the doors on any avenues in this  
game,'' he said. ``I would say the door's open.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molitor said many of his fondest memories are from his years as  
a Brewer, especially the friendships he made with Yount and Jim 
Gantner, both of whom spoke at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I talk about a specific year, '82 is the one that sticks  
out, believe me,'' he said, referring to the year the Brewers won 
the AL pennant and lost a seven-game World Series to St. Louis.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Goodwin on 15-Day DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Tom Goodwin was placed on the 15-day  
disabled list by the Texas Rangers on Saturday with a hip flexor 
injury sustained while running the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin suffered a small tear in his left hip flexor muscle in  
the sixth inning of Friday's 3-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies 
when he slid into third base on a double by Rusty Greer. The club 
said MRI results show the tear is not significant. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodwin, who was batting .240 with an American League-leading 27  
stolen bases, was placed on the disabled list for the first time in 
his career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers recalled Ruben Mateo from Triple-A Oklahoma to fill  
Goodwin's spot on the roster. Mateo, a 21-year-old outfielder 
considered the best prospect in the organization, was batting .340 
with 17 home runs and 58 RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Beat Generation Businesses Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When he wasn't on the road, Jack Kerouac  
spent some of his time at Vesuvio Cafe and City Lights Bookstore. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the owners of the two Beat Generation businesses have  
ensured that the landmarks will be around for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
	City Lights co-owners Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Nancy Peters,  
and Vesuvio managers Chris and Janet Clyde, recently bought the 
adjacent buildings where they had been long-term renters. Buying 
the buildings will keep the North Beach businesses out of the hands 
of mall developers and retail chains, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American corporate monoculture is making the world the  
same,'' said Ferlinghetti, a Beat poet and publisher who has run 
City Lights since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferlinghetti and Peters decided to buy their building in  
February after their neighbors across Kerouac Alley, named after 
the late author of ``On The Road,'' bought theirs in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferlinghetti brushed off questions about the sale price.  
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want to know,'' he said. ``We paid a small down  
payment. The bank really owns the building.''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Con Said To Admit Role in Deaths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- A man behind bars for a parole violation  
has admitted he was involved in the slayings of three Yosemite 
National Park sightseers, according to law enforcement sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugene Dykes of Modesto has been ``talking about what he  
knows,'' a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on 
Friday on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Other sources told the AP and the San Francisco Chronicle that  
Dykes admitted to taking part, but refused to elaborate on his 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Sund, a member of a wealthy real estate family in Eureka,  
vanished Feb. 15 along with her 15-year-old daughter Juli and their 
Argentine friend Silvina Pelosso during a trip through the Sierra 
foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	They were found dead weeks later and hours away from where they  
were last seen. The burned bodies of Mrs. Sund, 42, and Ms. 
Pelosso, 16, were found in the trunk of their charred rental car. 
Juli's body was discovered more than 30 miles away on a hill. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged in the slayings.  
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents have zeroed in on a loose-knit group of alleged  
methamphetamine users -- including Dykes and half-brother Michael 
Larwick -- and are confident that some of those responsible are 
already behind bars. They have refused to identify them or say how 
many there are. 
</P>
<P>
	Larwick has professed his innocence and said he provided a blood  
sample to clear his name. 
</P>
<P>
	Dykes was arrested March 5 -- weeks before the bodies were  
discovered -- on a parole violation after a standoff with 
authorities. He was later charged with being a convicted felon in 
possession of drugs and a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-con with a record of meth possession, unlawful sex and  
weapons convictions remains in custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe my son had anything to do with it,'' his  
father, Burel Dykes, said in May. ``He may know something, 
though.''

<HEADLINE> Camby Lifts Knicks to Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He looks like a basketball Gumby, all arms and  
legs stretched out, swatting shots away, grabbing rebounds, 
converting putbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus Camby, hidden away most of the season, turned out to be  
the catalyst for the New York Knicks' surprising advance to the NBA 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Camby came off the bench again in Game 6 against Indiana Friday  
night and contributed 15 points, nine rebounds and three blocked 
shots in the 90-82 victory that eliminated the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	With Larry Johnson down with sprained right knee ligaments,  
Camby played 37 minutes and can look for that kind of time in the 
NBA Finals against San Antonio starting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to go out there and play hard,'' said Camby,  
whose arrival in New York last summer was not exactly celebrated 
because the Knicks traded longtime New York favorite Charles Oakley 
to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``What drove me hard in the series was way back when I got  
traded, people were questioning the trade, saying I wasn't going to 
get it done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trade certainly wasn't coach Jeff Van Gundy's idea and he  
gave Camby only limited playing time during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the playoffs, Van Gundy gradually turned to the 6-foot-11  
Camby and was rewarded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy for Marcus because of his perseverance  
through the year,'' the coach said. ``He never pointed fingers of 
blame and just kept working and played so great. I'm really happy 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twice in the series against the Pacers, Camby had 21-point  
games. He grabbed 14 rebounds in Game 4 and 13 in the pivotal 
victory in Game 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the next challenge is San Antonio with David Robinson and  
Tim Duncan waiting for him under the basket. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to play hard,'' he said. ``I think this series  
helps me prepare for this. I'm definitely looking forward to the 
challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Wakefield Is New Red Sox Closer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A trip to New York turned out to be extremely  
costly for Boston's pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Bret Saberhagen was put back on the disabled list Saturday after  
cutting his left foot at a party, and with Tom Gordon hurting, the 
Red Sox said Tim Wakefield will be taking over as the team's 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care. Whatever it takes to win games,'' Wakefield said  
before Boston's 4-2 loss to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	Saberhagen, on the disabled list from May 6-June 1 because of a  
strained right shoulder, needed five stitches to close a cut 
sustained Thursday night when he invited teammates to a party at 
his Long Island home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It happened out on the pool deck,'' he said Friday. ``I'm glad  
it was me and not one of the other guys. I would have felt terrible 
if it had happened to someone else at one of my parties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To replace him, Boston recalled Kirk Bullinger from Triple-A  
Pawtucket, where he had six saves and a 3.00 ERA in 11 relief 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Portugal (3-4) will take Saberhagen's place in the rotation  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon blew his second straight save opportunity Friday night  
after converting a major league record 54 straight, then said his 
right elbow was hurting again. He spent a month on the disabled 
list earlier this season because of the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Boston decided to send him home for an MRI on Monday and,  
anticipating another trip to the DL, shift Wakefield into the 
bullpen. The Red Sox intend to bring up Jin Ho Cho from Triple-A 
Pawtucket to take over Wakefield's scheduled start Monday night 
against Minnesota at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Wakefield, 32, has made 165 career starts and 16 relief  
appearances. The knuckleballer is 3-6 with a 5.49 ERA in 11 starts 
and three relief appearances this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been in the bullpen before,'' Red Sox manager Jimy  
Williams said. ``He's done good out there, and we're in a situation 
right now where we need somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Gordon is 11-for-13 in save chances, the rest of Boston's  
bullpen is 6-for-16. Wakefield went 2-for-2 while Gordon was 
sidelined from April 18-May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's pitched three ninth innings for us this year, so he's not  
unfamiliar with it,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cho, 23, was 0-3 with an 8.20 ERA in four starts with the Red  
Sox last year, his first professional season, and went 8-3 in 18 
minor league starts. He is 7-1 with a 3.41 ERA this season at 
Pawtucket, striking out a team-high 58 in 71 1-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Modano Plays, Hull Doesn't </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dallas got injured Mike Modano back, but  
Brett Hull wasn't around long Saturday night as the Stars beat the 
Buffalo Sabres 2-1 in Game 3 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull, who scored 32 goals during the season and had seven in the  
playoffs, including the game-winner in Thursday night's 4-2 
victory, strained a groin muscle and played only 2:03 of the first 
period. He did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hully got a huge goal for us last game,'' Stars wing Dave Reid  
said. ``We just have to keep pumping. Everybody fills in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of the story of our team,'' Modano said.  
</P>
<P>
	Modano decided not to let a wrist injury keep him out. He played  
18:35, took five shots and won four of nine faceoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``He still has two good legs, and every time he has the puck  
he's a threat,'' Stars center Guy Carbonneau said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modano said he felt just a little discomfort as he skated a  
regular shift and worked special teams in Dallas' win that gave 
them a 2-1 lead in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We numbed it up a little bit to take the edge off,'' Modano  
said. ``As long as I don't feel it, it's fine. Just wanted to get 
out there and get a sweat, get involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, injured when he was checked along the boards by Sabres  
defenseman Jay McKee in Game 2, started at left wing with center 
Joe Nieuwendyk and Jere Lehtinen. He ended up skating on a line 
with Lehtinen and Tony Hrkac. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was limited in what I could do,'' Modano said. ``As far as  
faceoffs and bearing down it was not the way I wanted it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano, who called the injury ``a bad bruise,'' would play only  
if he could go full strength, Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock said 
before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players put it best,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's about time  
he feels like the rest of them -- average hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modano showed no signs of his injury. He stickhandled with  
apparent ease and indicated that he would be a factor early when he 
broke away from Sabres defenseman Rhett Warrener and went around 
McKee for two shots, both stopped by Dominik Hasek just a minute 
and a half into the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	His biggest problems were penalties. Modano took consecutive  
penalties in the second period for tripping and the slashing. Late 
in the period, he negated a Stars power play when he was called for 
interference on Sabres forward Dixon Ward with 37 seconds left in 
the period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too many refs out there right now,'' Modano said.  
</P>
<P>
	Modano had two assists in the first game against Buffalo for his  
fifth multi-point game of the playoffs. He had four assists in the 
last five playoff games and had a five-game playoff point (3-5-8) 
streak going into Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	He was tied for second in the playoffs in assists with 13, was  
fourth in points (18) and seventh in faceoff percentage, winning 
just over half.

overtook Iza Bon at the sixteenth pole and went on to a 3 1/2-length 
victory in the $100,000 Valkyr Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old filly carried 117 pounds and was ridden by  
Garrett Gomez. She covered 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf in 1:02 and 
returned $16.80, $6.20 and $4.40. 
</P>
<P>
	Iza Bon paid $4.60 and $3.60, while Queen's Bet was another  
three-quarters of a length back in third and paid $10.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Censored, the 13-10 favorite, pressed the early pace but faded  
and finished seventh in the field of nine California-bred fillies 
and mares. 
</P>
<P>
	The $60,000 purse brought Chichim's earnings to $144,310. It was  
her fourth victory in 12 starts for trainer Juan Garcia.

<P>
	His questions were answered quickly Saturday as the 4-year-old  
winner of the 1998 Belmont Stakes ran 1 1/8 miles in a track-record 
1:47.28 to win the $827,250 Stephen Foster Handicap for 3-year-olds 
and up at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse has been training just great,'' Walden said. ``I  
must have had 10 people come up to me the last two days and tell me 
I was a cinch just from seeing him train. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know about that Dubai thing. I've been waiting to  
run him and had been excited about it. Everybody wants to label the 
fact that they don't come back from Dubai well. I hope this puts it 
to bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advertised showdown between two former Triple Crown race  
winners eventually turned into a one-horse show. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jerry Bailey and carrying 120 pounds, Victory Gallop --  
who finished second in the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness to 
Real Quiet -- breezed past 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner 
Silver Charm in the stretch and beat him by 8 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old gray, ridden by 1999 Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
winner Chris Antley and carrying a race-high 123 pounds, broke 
strong but flattened out in the final furlong in losing his fourth 
consecutive race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just kind of ran an even race,'' said Antley, who was  
aboard the Bob Baffert-trained colt for the first time. ``I thought 
I had him in pretty good position but he just didn't fire when we 
needed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, who earned $512,895, went off at 6-5 and paid  
$4.60, $2.60 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Nite Dreamer, who carried 110 pounds and was ridden by Pat Day,  
finished second, about three-quarters of a length back, and paid 
$4.80 and $2.10. Littlebitlively, who carried 115 pounds and was 
ridden by Calvin Borel, was another three-quarters of a length back 
in third and paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Littlebitlively, who lost by a head to Silver Charm in last  
year's Clark Handicap, dueled with Connecting Terms for the first 
three-quarters of a mile. As the field moved around the far turn, 
Nite Dreamer made his bid for the lead as Victory Gallop charged 
from the back of the seven-horse field to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said he was amazed by the power in Victory Gallop's  
stride as he took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dropped back farther than I thought he would, about 12 or  
14 lengths off the lead,'' Bailey said. ``He was content to be 
there until I pulled the trigger. And then it was the most powerful 
rush I've felt around a turn since I've been riding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigar made strong moves all the way in races, but when horses  
take off like that and make up the kind of time he did today, it's 
just devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ride was Antley's first since pulling up an injured  
Charismatic as the colt neared the finish line in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic broke two bones in his lower left foot and was  
retired following surgery to repair the damage. Veterinarians 
credited Antley, who jumped off and immediately picked the leg up 
to keep weight off it, with preventing more serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly feel revived because the horse is OK -- that was my  
biggest concern,'' Antley said. ``Charismatic has given me so much 
in my career and my comeback. ... He gave me some of my greatest 
moments ever. I felt something was wrong and what I did was simply 
instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley said Charismatic had been on his mind a lot since the  
Belmont but had no effect on the way he rode Silver Charm on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``New race, new horse, new beginning and a lot of hope,'' Antley  
said.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Tests Campaign Waters in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush plunged into the 2000  
presidential race Saturday, declaring ``there's no turning back'' 
from his bid to usher in a new era of Republican politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud to be a compassionate conservative,'' he said.  
``And on this ground I will make my stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flying from Austin aboard his ``Great Expectations'' charter  
plane, the Texas governor embarked on his first campaign trip -- 
already positioned as the party's leader in polls, money-raising 
and endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running for the presidency of the United States,'' Bush  
said, making his intentions more clear than ever. ``There's no 
turning back and I intend to be the next president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican rivals, Democratic operatives and more than 200  
journalists followed Bush's every step, taking measure of whether 
he is prepared for the pressures of a front-running campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush displayed a knack for working small crowds: shaking hands,  
patting shoulders, grabbing elbows, signing autographs and joking 
with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Quick with a quip and sporting a crooked smile, Bush showed a  
hands-on, familiar campaign style reminiscent of President 
Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like those shades,'' Bush told Dorothy Thompson of Des  
Moines, placing his hands firmly on both of her shoulders and 
peeking behind the glasses. ``I like those eyes!'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Yvonne Peasley reached out to shake his hand, Bush noticed  
a camera dangling from her wrist. ``Let me have that,'' Bush said, 
slipping the camera off her arm and handing it to an aide. ``Let's 
get us a picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What a sweet, nice man,'' Peasley said later.  
</P>
<P>
	That is the impression Bush hopes to leave as he introduces his  
brand of ``compassionate conservative'' politics to Iowa and New 
Hampshire on this four-day swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In his centerpiece address at a country barbecue, Bush promised  
to end ``this season of cynicism'' in American politics. 
Republicans can be conservative without being mean about it, he 
said, offering these prescriptions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Cut taxes, but help people save and make more money.  
</P>
<P>
	--Cut welfare rolls, but ``confront the suffering that remains.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Retain local control of schools, but ``make sure that no single  
child gets left behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that this approach has been criticized, but why? Is  
compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our party be led 
by someone who boasts of a hard heart?'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of his campaign came quickly, from both parties.  
</P>
<P>
	``Compassionate conservatism is a contrived cop-out,'' said Joe  
Andrew of the Democratic National Committee, who pigeonholed 
reporters as they stepped out of Bush's motorcade for the address. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's surprising that he would launch his campaign on such  
defensive ground,'' said Brian Kennedy, political director for 
sagging GOP hopeful Lamar Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to cede to Bush, Alexander, John Kasich and Elizabeth  
Dole took their GOP campaigns to Iowa on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who petted pigs at a pork expo, called herself a  
``courageous conservative,'' implying that Bush has failed to take 
stands on tough national issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes watched Kennedy and Andrew walk  
from reporter to reporter. With a nervous laugh, she said, ``Bright 
lights attract moths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among Bush's policy proposals were promises to reduce marginal  
tax rates, allow Americans to invest their Social Security taxes 
and add ``a touch of iron'' to the U.S. military. He leveled one 
attack against President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, saying 
``they did not invent prosperity'' in America. 
</P>
<P>
	His top goals:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Draw a moral line'' and encourage personal responsibility  
from Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Get faith-based organizations and such as churches involved in  
easing social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improve schools so that ``no child will be left behind.''  
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, is many ways the phantom frontrunner. Though dominate  
in a campaign he avoided until now, the son of former President 
George Bush is little-known outside Texas. He has held elective 
office for just 4 1/2 years and has little experience as a national 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Bush with a wide lead over GOP foes, though pollsters  
say the Texas governor benefits from people confusing the younger 
and old Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Time magazine survey found 63 percent of Americans see  
George W. Bush as a lot like his father. A Newsweek poll found 49 
percent of Americans feel that being the son of a former president 
will help Bush is his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-elected governor also is being helped by a craving  
among Republicans for a winner, after Clinton won in 1992 and 1996 
and his party picked up House seats in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's blend of conservative politics couched in soothing,  
moderate rhetoric could help move the GOP to the center -- much as 
Clinton refocused his party away from its liberal extremes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Bush formally would announce his candidacy in the  
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the first step by pledging to compete in the Ames, Iowa,  
straw poll in August. Trying to lower expectations, aides said the 
odds were against Bush winning the event -- and it was unclear how 
much time and money Bush is willing to devote to contest. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  NL Suspends Mets' Valentine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that the National League has seen through  
his disguise, Bobby Valentine admits he was the mysterious man in 
the mustache but says he never went back to his team's dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets manager was suspended for two games and fined  
$5,000 Friday by the NL for returning to the dugout in a disguise 
after being ejected Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture looked like I was in the dugout, but they got it  
all wrong,'' Valentine said before showing reporters the spot 
between the runway and the dugout, where he stood with a fake 
mustache and glasses for the last two innings of Wednesday night's 
game against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I absolutely was never in the dugout,'' Valentine insisted.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was ejected in the 12th inning by plate umpire Randy  
Marsh for arguing a catcher's interference call on Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said he then went into the trainers' room and came out  
with eye black on his upper lip. He showed it to a couple of his 
pitchers in the clubhouse who laughed and then gave him sunglasses 
and a hat. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly was spotted in the dugout by a television camera.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't fooling anyone with that disguise,'' he said. ``If  
Randy Marsh saw it, I believe he would have laughed. This had 
absolutely nothing to do with the umpires. I did it to lighten up 
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman apparently didn't chuckle. He cited  
league rule 5.1, which says: ``When a manager, player, coach or 
trainer is put out of a game by an umpire, he shall leave the field 
immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule goes on to say ejected personnel ``shall remain in the  
clubhouse until the game is ended or change to street clothes and 
either leave the park or take a seat in the grandstand well removed 
from the vicinity of his club's bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand now that I wasn't supposed to be here,''  
Valentine said, standing one step away from the dugout. ``I had 
never read the rule before today. Now I know I need to be in the 
clubhouse. Every manager I've ever seen ejected has been standing 
in the runway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre, no stranger to turmoil, shook his  
head when asked about Valentine's penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``See what happens when you manage in New York,'' Torre said in  
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was laughing. The disguise, it was comical to look at it,''  
Chicago Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``Bobby's something. He's 
a character. He's a brilliant baseball man, extremely intelligent. 
I think Bobby was having some fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension was to start Saturday but Valentine appealed,  
meaning it will not begin until after a hearing before Coleman. The 
appeal likely will be heard next week in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to discuss it,'' Valentine said. ``I don't  
think anything is going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing appears to have changed, either, in the conflict between  
Valentine and Bobby Bonilla. After being told on Monday that he 
would not start for six days, the slumping Bonilla refused to pinch 
hit Tuesday. Valentine then refused to use him the next night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to be compatible with the manager,'' said  
Bonilla, who was available to play Friday. ``I need to do my job. 
He's the guy in charge and I will do whatever he asks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla claimed he learned about his benching from the  
newspapers as well as Valentine. The manager insists he told the 
player one day before it was reported in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him in my office Monday and told him other guys would  
play the outfield this week,'' Valentine said. ``There is no doubt 
in my mind that I told him, and there should be no doubt in his 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla, who is owed $9,575,411 through the 2000 season, is  
hitting .167 in 90 at-bats. He says he's not bothered by the 
situation and wants to stay with the Mets, even though they would 
like to dump him. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Steve Phillips reportedly put him on waivers  
last week and said he is exploring trades. Bonilla's salary and 
inability to play the field make him unattractive to most teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident Steve Phillips will be able to work out some  
sort of deal to the satisfaction of the Mets and Bobby Bonilla,'' 
said Jeff Borris, one of the outfielder's agents. ``I know they're 
trying to put something together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he has the authority from ownership to release  
Bonilla, but that remains ``a last resort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been disruptive and we need to settle it down soon,''  
Phillips said. ``It's not a situation where the two of them need to 
go out for dinner. But they have to get along within the framework 
of the team to help us win. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Mets activated RHP Greg McMichael and optioned INF  
Melvin Mora to Triple-A Norfolk. McMichael has missed the entire 
season with a sore shoulder. He gives Valentine 12 pitchers on the 
roster.

<HEADLINE> Grand Slams Coming at Record Pace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Picture the possibilities.  
</P>
<P>
	Runners on every base, leading away cautiously. The pitcher left  
with no margin for mistakes, no place to park the next hitter. The 
batter taking his practice swings, looking menacing, largely 
because of the danger he represents. 
</P>
<P>
	One swing, four runs.  
</P>
<P>
	The grand slam home run is baseball's ultimate exclamation  
point, a defining moment that changes the whole complexion of a 
ball game. It is a game-turner that touches off home plate 
celebrations, a convention of three runners, the batboy and the 
on-deck hitter as the batter completes his triumphant trot around 
the bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Major league hitters have been taking those trots at a record  
pace this season. A little more than one-third of the way through 
the season, 59 slams were hit. That pace would produce 165 of them, 
breaking the single-season record of 141 hit in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	But way before that there was Lou Gehrig, who had a record 23  
slams among his 493 career homers. When he hit them, they were just 
bases-loaded homers, not yet anointed with the more glamorous 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	The term grand slam, which has its origins in bridge, was first  
used in sports to describe Bobby Jones' sweep of four major golf 
championships -- the British and U.S. Opens and Amateurs -- in 1930. 
Later, it was extended to tennis' four majors -- Australia, the 
French, Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. Don Budge became the first 
American to complete a tennis Grand Slam in 1938 and two years 
later, baseball discovered the phrase. 
</P>
<P>
	It first appeared Aug. 20, 1940, in the San Francisco News when  
a home run with the bases loaded by Jim Tabor was described as a 
``grand slammer.'' Tabor knew all about those bases-loaded shots. 
He had hit two of them in one game a year earlier, on July 4, 1939, 
the day an ailing Gehrig was honored at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Gehrig, however, never bunched his slams the way modern sluggers  
are this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Robin Ventura hit two on May 20, one in each game of a  
doubleheader. Nomar Garciaparra also hit two on May 10 but needed 
just one game to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretty good stuff except that on April 23, Fernando Tatis hit  
two, not only in one night, or one game, but in one inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura's feat -- two slams in two games in one night -- was a  
record and made him the first player to hit two slams in a single 
day twice. He also did it for the Chicago White Sox on Sept. 4, 
1995. Nobody had ever hit two in one inning before Muscles Tatis, 
all 175 pounds of him, unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Willie McCovey, who owns the National League record with 18  
slams, has a theory. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think pitchers work on weaknesses as well as they did  
in my day,'' he said. ``I also think the ball is livelier. I see 
some funny-looking swings and the ball winds up in the upper deck. 
They're not that much stronger than we were.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grand slams are no simple matter. Consider that when Babe Ruth  
hit 60 home runs in 1927, just two came with the bases loaded. And 
he hit them in consecutive games on Sept. 27 and Sept. 29, No. 57 
and No. 59, making the Babe the first modern hitter to connect for 
slams in two straight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark McGwire had just two slams among his record 70 homers last  
season. And when Roger Maris broke Ruth's record with 61 in 1961, 
none were grand slams. 
</P>
<P>
	McCovey thought his success with the bases loaded was a matter  
of concentration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I approached at-bats differently when there were men in  
scoring position,'' he said. ``That's why I was a good RBI man. 
Mostly, it was concentration and determination. I seemed to be able 
to concentrate more on the pitcher and how he was going to pitch 
me. 
</P>
<P>
	``No at-bat is meaningless, but when nobody was on base, I  
wasn't able to concentrate as well. That's one of the reasons I 
admired Pete Rose. He approached every at-bat as if the game was on 
the line. I was not able to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most remarkable grand slam statistics belong to a  
couple of pitchers, Jim Palmer and Tony Cloninger. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer pitched for 19 seasons, threw 3,948 innings and never  
once gave up a home run with the bases loaded. And Cloninger, who 
had a career batting average of .192, is one of just 11 players to 
hit two slams in a single game. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloninger's big game came on July 3, 1966, in Candlestick Park.  
Besides the two homers, he had an RBI single, a bases-loaded fly to 
the fence and a chance at a third slam in the ninth inning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Denis Menke swung at a 3-1 pitch with the bases loaded to make  
the last out,'' he said. ``It would've been ball four. The crowd 
was rooting for me to get up one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``People don't remember that I won 113 games in the big leagues  
or that I won 24 one year and 19 in another. They just remember me 
as the pitcher who hit the two grand slams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer's record is not totally unblemished. Freddie Patek,  
hardly a slugger, got him in spring training one year, and Johnny 
Bench, a more legitimate threat, tagged one off him in the minors. 
Palmer blamed old pal Earl Weaver -- who else? -- for the Bench slam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pitching a game -- it was when I hurt my shoulder in 1967  
-- and Earl was managing Rochester,'' Palmer said. ``I was throwing 
about 80 mph. I couldn't throw at all. I struck out Bench the first 
time and I didn't know who he was. I'd seen him hit a little broken 
bat single and someone said he was a little Punch-and-Judy hitter. 
I had no idea he had 22 home runs in 30 games or something. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a 6-0 lead. I walked the bases loaded and Weaver was  
incensed. Bench was the hitter. He said to throw the ball down the 
middle and I did. He hit it about 475 feet to left center field. 
And that was the last time I listened to Earl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So how did Palmer avoid surrendering slams? The same way McCovey  
hit so many of them. Concentration. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't give in,'' he said. ``My first game in the big  
leagues, I came in in relief in Boston when I was 19 to face Tony 
Conigliaro. I'm a high fastball pitcher and he's a high fastball 
hitter. I ended up striking him out on three pitches. I never 
wanted to give in. You don't have to be a math major to know one's 
a lot better (to give up) than four.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The term grand slam is also found in cocktail lounges nowadays.  
Bartenders in the know construct them by mixing a half-jigger of 
blended whiskey, a quarter-jigger of vermouth, an eighth-jigger of 
curacao and an eighth-jigger of lime juice. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, by just hanging a curve ball with the bases loaded.

<HEADLINE>  NL Suspends Mets' Valentine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Now that the National League has seen through  
his disguise, Bobby Valentine admits he was the mysterious man in 
the mustache but says he never went back to his team's dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mets manager was suspended for two games and fined  
$5,000 Friday by the NL for returning to the dugout in a disguise 
after being ejected Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``The picture looked like I was in the dugout, but they got it  
all wrong,'' Valentine said before showing reporters the spot 
between the runway and the dugout, where he stood with a fake 
mustache and glasses for the last two innings of Wednesday night's 
game against Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``I absolutely was never in the dugout,'' Valentine insisted.  
</P>
<P>
	Valentine was ejected in the 12th inning by plate umpire Randy  
Marsh for arguing a catcher's interference call on Mike Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
	Valentine said he then went into the trainers' room and came out  
with eye black on his upper lip. He showed it to a couple of his 
pitchers in the clubhouse who laughed and then gave him sunglasses 
and a hat. 
</P>
<P>
	He quickly was spotted in the dugout by a television camera.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't fooling anyone with that disguise,'' he said. ``If  
Randy Marsh saw it, I believe he would have laughed. This had 
absolutely nothing to do with the umpires. I did it to lighten up 
the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NL president Len Coleman apparently didn't chuckle. He cited  
league rule 5.1, which says: ``When a manager, player, coach or 
trainer is put out of a game by an umpire, he shall leave the field 
immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rule goes on to say ejected personnel ``shall remain in the  
clubhouse until the game is ended or change to street clothes and 
either leave the park or take a seat in the grandstand well removed 
from the vicinity of his club's bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand now that I wasn't supposed to be here,''  
Valentine said, standing one step away from the dugout. ``I had 
never read the rule before today. Now I know I need to be in the 
clubhouse. Every manager I've ever seen ejected has been standing 
in the runway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees manager Joe Torre, no stranger to turmoil, shook his  
head when asked about Valentine's penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``See what happens when you manage in New York,'' Torre said in  
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was laughing. The disguise, it was comical to look at it,''  
Chicago Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. ``Bobby's something. He's 
a character. He's a brilliant baseball man, extremely intelligent. 
I think Bobby was having some fun with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspension was to start Saturday but Valentine appealed,  
meaning it will not begin until after a hearing before Coleman. The 
appeal likely will be heard next week in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to discuss it,'' Valentine said. ``I don't  
think anything is going to change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nothing appears to have changed, either, in the conflict between  
Valentine and Bobby Bonilla. After being told on Monday that he 
would not start for six days, the slumping Bonilla refused to pinch 
hit Tuesday. Valentine then refused to use him the next night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to be compatible with the manager,'' said  
Bonilla, who was available to play Friday. ``I need to do my job. 
He's the guy in charge and I will do whatever he asks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla claimed he learned about his benching from the  
newspapers as well as Valentine. The manager insists he told the 
player one day before it was reported in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called him in my office Monday and told him other guys would  
play the outfield this week,'' Valentine said. ``There is no doubt 
in my mind that I told him, and there should be no doubt in his 
mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonilla, who is owed $9,575,411 through the 2000 season, is  
hitting .167 in 90 at-bats. He says he's not bothered by the 
situation and wants to stay with the Mets, even though they would 
like to dump him. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Steve Phillips reportedly put him on waivers  
last week and said he is exploring trades. Bonilla's salary and 
inability to play the field make him unattractive to most teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm confident Steve Phillips will be able to work out some  
sort of deal to the satisfaction of the Mets and Bobby Bonilla,'' 
said Jeff Borris, one of the outfielder's agents. ``I know they're 
trying to put something together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said he has the authority from ownership to release  
Bonilla, but that remains ``a last resort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It has been disruptive and we need to settle it down soon,''  
Phillips said. ``It's not a situation where the two of them need to 
go out for dinner. But they have to get along within the framework 
of the team to help us win. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Mets activated RHP Greg McMichael and optioned INF  
Melvin Mora to Triple-A Norfolk. McMichael has missed the entire 
season with a sore shoulder. He gives Valentine 12 pitchers on the 
roster.

<HEADLINE>  Knicks Advance Without Johnson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On Friday night, the big L stood for longshot,  
which was the only way to look at how the New York Knicks advanced 
into the NBA Finals after Larry Johnson went down with a knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Already undermanned with the loss of center Patrick Ewing, the  
Knicks shrugged off Johnson's second-period knee injury to overcome 
the Indiana Pacers 90-82 in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference 
Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, whose `Big L' arm sign has become his trademark after  
baskets, missed the celebration. He was in the hospital with 
strained right knee ligaments after Travis Best rolled into him 
midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The collision left Johnson screaming in pain, clutching his knee  
and, some might have thought, taking the Knicks' chances down with 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't turn out that way.  
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, Larry's a great player and emotionally it takes a  
toll on your team,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``Our guys 
fought. We had to just hang around. Somehow we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the formula throughout the series and it worked again.  
At one point, Chris Childs made a third-quarter basket and formed 
the L with his arms, a reminder that the Knicks had Johnson on 
their mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston, who started the game missing four of five shots,  
hit 11 of his next 12 to lead all scorers with 32 points. Marcus 
Camby, who blossomed in the Indiana series, picked up much of 
Johnson's playing time and had 15. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to keep doing what I was doing after Larry went  
down,'' Houston said. ``I didn't want to put more pressure on 
myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Allan was huge,'' Van Gundy said. ``The will and the work and  
commitment they had, I feel good for those guys. It got to the 
point where all they cared about was winning. It's hard to get to 
but we got to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of Johnson seemed to be no big deal to the Knicks, who  
adjusted on the fly. Camby and Kurt Thomas picked up his playing 
time and, as they have throughout the playoffs, the Knicks found a 
way to win. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson went down, he remained on the floor for several  
minutes. He was immediately surrounded by teammates and helped off 
by Herb Williams and Chris Dudley, led into the locker room by Dr. 
Norman Scott, the team physician. 
</P>
<P>
	X-rays were negative and the preliminary diagnosis was sprained  
ligaments. Johnson was taken to a hospital for a precautionary MRI 
examination. He will be re-evaluated on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks' front line is already shorthanded after Ewing  
suffered a partial tear in his left Achilles, ending his season 
after two games of the Eastern Conference finals. Ewing led cheers 
from the bench as his team closed in on the victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Practice should be interesting,'' Van Gundy said, thinking  
about the injuries. ``I'm going to get some (playing) time in 
practice. So that will be good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was a vital cog in the Knicks' attack. His four-point  
play -- a 3-point field goal followed by a free throw -- with 5.7 
seconds left provided the deciding points in the Knicks' 92-91 
victory in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 5, Johnson hit consecutive 3-pointers down the stretch  
as New York pulled away for a 101-94 victory that put it in 
position to close out the Pacers at home. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was injured, Johnson had just scored two baskets after  
an 0-for-3 first quarter. He left the game having scored eight 
points in 14 minutes.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A bus collided head-on with a  
truck carrying apples in southwestern Brazil on Saturday, killing 
four people and injuring 20, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officer Ricardo Schneider in Cascavel, 600 miles southwest of  
Rio, said the bus was carrying mainly ``baggers,'' a local term for 
Brazilians who buy low-priced goods in nearby Paraguay and resell 
them illegally at home.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian aircraft manufacturer  
Embraer has won contracts worth $4.8 billion from European regional 
airlines, a record for the company, Brazilian media reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The orders are for 200 ERJ commuter jets, the Estado de Sao  
Paulo newspaper said. It did not name the buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The contracts were to be announced in Paris on Monday by Embraer  
President Mauricio Botelho, the daily reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Embraer is a former government-run company and chronic  
money-loser that turned around after it was privatized in 1994. 
Last year, it made a profit of $102.9 million, the first in its 
30-year history.

<P>
	Film footage showed cabinets and walls in the bar riddled with  
bullet holes. The Sao Paulo police department said it had no 
information on the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-six people have died in 28 multiple-victim killings in  
Sao Paulo this year, Globo said. Most of the shootings are believed 
to have been carried out by drug traffickers.

	SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- Costa Rica's governing party on  
Saturday denied claims it received $1 million in campaign money 
from a Mexican policitian cited in a U.S. intelligence report as 
posing a ``significant criminal threat'' to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A government statement called ``slanderous'' accusations that  
Carlos Hank Gonzalez, a former Mexican Cabinet secretary, gave the 
money to the 1997 election campaign of President Miguel Angel 
Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carlos Hank didn't give a single cent to the Social Christian  
campaign, and that can be verified by anybody,'' the statement 
continued. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, three congressmen of the opposition National  
Liberation Party said they had information on the alleged campaign 
contributions. The opposition has called for a formal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Media reports in May cited a U.S. intelligence report describing  
Hank Gonzalez and his sons as ``a significant criminal threat to 
the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Hank Gonzalez, one of the most prominent members  
of Mexico's ruling class, has denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs India, Pakistan Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Markets in India and Pakistan would remain  
open to U.S. farm products under legislation passed by the Senate 
that allows President Clinton to waive economic sanctions imposed 
last year after the countries conducted nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The tests led the United States, as required by law, to suspend  
agricultural credit programs and other aid, investments and loan 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressured by farm groups worried that U.S. growers would lose  
export markets amid plummeting commodity prices, Congress approved, 
and Clinton signed, a one-year waiver that exempted agricultural 
products and other items from the sanctions. The waiver expires in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, without objection, last week approved legislation  
that would lift economic sanctions for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major breakthrough,'' said a sponsor, GOP Sen. Pat  
Roberts of Kansas, who serves on the Agriculture Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going through a difficult time in agriculture, and this  
will mean USDA credit programs are available to India and Pakistan. 
It should be very significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that after last year's waiver, U.S. traders secured a  
wheat purchase from Pakistan worth nearly $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions drew heavy criticism in Congress as ineffective in  
controlling nuclear proliferation but damaging to U.S. economic 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has not dealt with the sanctions issue and the  
administration has not taken a position on the Senate measure. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, White House allies were pushing a three-year  
version of the waiver authority. What cleared the Senate as part of 
its fiscal 2000 defense spending bill is a broader, GOP-sponsored 
measure that suspends economic sanctions for the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would continue U.S. bans on missile and nuclear  
technology and military sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Looking beyond immediate trade deals, the Senate measure would  
help expand relations with India, said another sponsor, Sen. Sam 
Brownback, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on 
Near Eastern and South Asian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	With a growing population and expanding middle class, India  
could help offset the United States' heavy dependence on trade with 
China, said Brownback, R-Kan. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations with China are rocky in light of a recent  
congressional report alleging China stole secrets from U.S. nuclear 
weapons labs and NATO's accidental NATO bombing of China's embassy 
in Belgrade, which killed three Chinese citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plus, India is a democracy; China is not a democracy,''  
Brownback said. ``India doesn't have the human rights abuses that 
China does. India is not stealing our military secrets and India 
doesn't have missiles pointed at us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the trade issue grabs lawmakers' attention, the United  
States and other countries are urging India and Pakistan to show 
restraint as they fight over a disputed Himalayan battle zone along 
a 1972 cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between the two hostile 
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Rapids 1, MetroStars 0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Jorge Dely Valdes headed in a  
corner kick by Anders Limpar in the 88th minute Saturday night and 
the Colorado Rapids beat New York-New Jersey 1-0, the MetroStars' 
fourth straight loss. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the eighth in the last nine matches for the  
Rapids (8-3). The MetroStars (4-8) lost for the seventh time in 
their last eight matches. 
</P>
<P>
	The match appeared to be headed for a shootout but the Rapids  
got a corner kick when a counter attack cross was headed over the 
goal line by MetroStars defender Kevin Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Limpar, who has recorded all five of his assists this season on  
corner kicks, put the ball into the middle of the box and the 
6-foot-1 Dely Valdes outleaped the defense and MetroStars 
goalkeeper Tim Howard, snapping his header into the right corner of 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the game-winner, the MetroStars had the better chances. In  
the 19th minute, they had a flurry that included four quality shots 
on the Colorado goal. 
</P>
<P>
	But shots by Eduardo Hurtado and Brian Kelly were parried away  
by keeper Marcus Hahnemann, a rebound by Mike Sorber was blocked by 
Matt McKeon and Mark Chung's shot sailed high over the bar. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 44th minute, Hurtado was dragged down from behind just  
outside the box, resulting in a red card to Kevin Anderson. But the 
MetroStars were unable to capitalize on the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Hurtado had three more good chances in the second half but New  
York-New Jersey also lost defender Mark Semioli when he received 
his second yellow card of the match and was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
	Substitute Nansha Kalonji almost scored for the MetroStars in  
the 84th minute when his header, also off a corner kick, was saved 
off the line by defender Ross Paule. 
</P>
<P>
	Hahnemann had his third shutout of the year and second this  
season over the MetroStars, making seven saves.

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson Buys 'Wind' Oscar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Jackson got an Oscar for best motion  
picture today. The film was ``Gone With the Wind,'' and he had to 
pay $1.5 million for it. 
</P>
<P>
	The entertainer phoned in his bid to Sotheby's to purchase the  
statuette awarded to David O. Selznick for the 1939 movie, 
Sotheby's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the auction, the Oscar had been estimated at a value of  
up to only about $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Also sold on Sotheby's auction block Saturday was the film's  
final shooting script, containing the then-controversial line 
spoken by Clark Gable -- ``Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn'' -- 
Rhett Butler's famous last words to petulant wife Scarlett O'Hara. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog-eared script, with last-minute changes scribbled on pink  
and cream pages, was sold to an unidentified New York collector for 
$46,000, against a pre-sale estimate of $40,000 to $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	And then there was the orchid percale dress that took Vivien  
Leigh through much of the Civil War movie. She went from clean and 
neat before fleeing the burning Atlanta to dirty and tattered as 
she struggled to support her family at their once-grand estate, 
Tara. 
</P>
<P>
	The dress, one of 27 identical dresses made for the wear and  
tear of filming the movie, went for $90,500 to a Brazilian woman 
who wouldn't give her name to reporters. The costume had a pre-sale 
estimate of $10,000 to $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's auction also included memorabilia from the Coney  
Island amusement park, including a 1930s ``kicking mule'' game, 
whose object was to hit a donkey's behind. It drew $2,875. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fascinated by the peculiar brand of carnie and folk  
art,'' said seller Lenny Goodstein, who had traveled with a circus 
in his youth. 
</P>
<P>
	His collection of trophies from the Brooklyn amusement haven  
once known as ``Sodom by the Sea'' included the ``Extraordinary 
bubble blowing clown.'' The huge clown face, fitted with a 
bubble-blowing apparatus, fetched $10,350.

<HEADLINE> Padres Place Ashby on DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- San Diego Padres pitcher Andy Ashby was scratched  
from a scheduled start against Houston today night and placed on 
the 15-day disabled list because of a lower back strain. 
</P>
<P>
	``After talking it over we decided it was best to go ahead and  
(place Ashby on the disabled list) rather than try and see if he 
could go and risk aggravating it more,'' San Diego general manager 
Kevin Towers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The move is retroactive to June 7.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashby is 6-4 with a 3.65 ERA in 12 starts. The right-hander  
leads the Padres in victories and his two shutouts are tied for the 
major league lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Boehringer started in place of Ashby against Houston  
Saturday night. The Padres recalled right-hander Carlos Almanzar 
from Triple-A Las Vegas to take Ashby's spot on the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Almanzar, 25, was 1-2 with a 14.63 ERA in six relief appearances  
for Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE>  Bush Tests Campaign Waters in Iowa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush plunged into the 2000  
presidential race Saturday, declaring ``there's no turning back'' 
from his bid to usher in a new era of Republican politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud to be a compassionate conservative,'' he said.  
``And on this ground I will make my stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flying from Austin aboard his ``Great Expectations'' charter  
plane, the Texas governor embarked on his first campaign trip -- 
already positioned as the party's leader in polls, money-raising 
and endorsements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm running for the presidency of the United States,'' Bush  
said. ``There's no turning back and I intend to be the next 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This exploratory stuff is over. I'm running,'' Bush told  
supporters in Des Moines later in the day. ``I am some kind of 
fired up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican rivals, Democratic operatives and more than 200  
journalists followed Bush's every step, taking measure of whether 
he is prepared for the pressures of a front-running campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush displayed a knack for working small crowds: shaking hands,  
patting shoulders, grabbing elbows, signing autographs and joking 
with supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, he focused on telling Iowans what they like to  
hear. In Des Moines, he announced his supports of subsidies for 
ethanol -- a fuel made by corn -- and said he will compete in the 
August straw poll in Ames, Iowa, a traditional test of early 
political strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Bush's policy proposals were promises to reduce marginal  
tax rates, allow Americans to invest their Social Security taxes 
and add ``a touch of iron'' to the U.S. military. He leveled one 
attack against President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, saying 
``they did not invent prosperity'' in America. 
</P>
<P>
	His top goals:  
</P>
<P>
	--''Draw a moral line'' and encourage personal responsibility  
from Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	--Get faith-based organizations and such as churches involved in  
easing social problems. 
</P>
<P>
	--Improve schools so that ``no child will be left behind.''  
</P>
<P>
	Quick with a quip and sporting a crooked smile, Bush showed a  
hands-on, familiar campaign style. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like those shades,'' Bush told Dorothy Thompson of Des  
Moines, placing his hands firmly on both of her shoulders and 
peeking behind the glasses. ``I like those eyes!'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Yvonne Peasley reached out to shake his hand, Bush noticed  
a camera dangling from her wrist. ``Let me have that,'' Bush said, 
slipping the camera off her arm and handing it to an aide. ``Let's 
get us a picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What a sweet, nice man,'' Peasley said later.  
</P>
<P>
	That is the impression Bush hopes to leave as he introduces his  
brand of ``compassionate conservative'' politics to Iowa and New 
Hampshire on this four-day swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In his centerpiece address at a country barbecue, Bush promised  
to end ``this season of cynicism'' in American politics. 
Republicans can be conservative without being mean, he said, 
offering these prescriptions: 
</P>
<P>
	--Cut taxes, but help people save and make more money.  
</P>
<P>
	--Cut welfare rolls, but ``confront the suffering that remains.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Retain local control of schools, but ``make sure that no single  
child gets left behind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that this approach has been criticized, but why? Is  
compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our party be led 
by someone who boasts of a hard heart?'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Criticism of his campaign came quickly, from both parties.  
</P>
<P>
	``Compassionate conservatism is a contrived cop-out,'' said Joe  
Andrew of the Democratic National Committee, who pigeonholed 
reporters as they stepped out of Bush's motorcade for the address. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't beat Al Gore by trying to sound like Bill Clinton,''  
GOP hopeful Lamar Alexander said in the text of a speech scheduled 
for delivery in New Hampshire on Sunday. ``People are tired of Bill 
Clinton's weasel words. If we want to win, we should give them 
straight, plain talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander's political director, Brian Kennedy, followed Bush to  
every Iowa stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Refusing to cede to Bush, Alexander, John Kasich and Elizabeth  
Dole took their GOP campaigns to Iowa on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who petted pigs at a pork expo, called herself a  
``courageous conservative,'' implying that Bush has failed to take 
stands on tough national issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes watched Kennedy and Andrew walk  
from reporter to reporter. With a nervous laugh, she said, ``Bright 
lights attract moths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, 52, is many ways the phantom frontrunner. Though dominate  
in a campaign he avoided until now, the son of former President 
George Bush is little-known outside Texas. He has held elective 
office for just 4 1/2 years and has little experience as a national 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls show Bush with a wide lead over GOP foes, though pollsters  
say the Texas governor benefits from people confusing the younger 
and old Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	A new Time magazine survey found 63 percent of Americans see  
George W. Bush as a lot like his father. A Newsweek poll found 49 
percent of Americans feel that being the son of a former president 
will help Bush is his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The twice-elected governor also is being helped by a craving  
among Republicans for a winner, after Clinton beat his father in 
1992, won re-election in 1996 and his party picked up House seats 
in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's blend of conservative politics couched in soothing,  
moderate rhetoric could help move the GOP to the center -- much as 
Clinton refocused his party away from its liberal extremes in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Bush formally would announce his candidacy in the  
fall. 
</P>
<P>
	He took the first step by pledging to compete in the Ames, Iowa,  
straw poll in August. Trying to lower expectations, aides said the 
odds were against Bush winning the event -- and it was unclear how 
much time and money Bush is willing to devote to contest.

<HEADLINE> US Soccer Team Expects Good Crowd </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bruce Arena expects the U.S. men's soccer team  
to be at home in more than name only when it plays Argentina on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	When the national team played in the U.S. Cup in March, that  
wasn't the case. Throngs of fans cheered loudly for foreign players 
in the Americans' 3-1 victory over Guatemala in San Diego and their 
2-1 loss to Mexico in the championship game in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were very much the visiting team,'' said Arena. ``I don't  
mind that -- it's a great challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Arena expects a pro-American crowd of 40,000 at RFK Stadium.  
Since an exhibition between Argentina and Mexico at Soldier Field 
in Chicago on June 9 drew a sellout crowd of 64,443, that makes 
Arena's prediction more than wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time in a while,'' Arena said, ``I think we're  
going to see an American crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	How the retooled U.S. squad will react against a world soccer  
power, and what strategy Argentina will employ, remain to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams last met in 1995, when the U.S. upset Argentina 3-0 in  
the Copa America Cup, but Argentina holds a lifetime 4-1 mark 
against the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	This match should be a gauge of Arena's impact since taking over  
as coach last year -- and of the Americans' progress since a dismal 
showing in World Cup 1998 that hastened Arena's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right way to find a balance is to be given great  
challenges,'' Arena said. ``We realize this is just a measuring 
stick of where we are as a team and where our players are as 
individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina is the third South American foe the U.S. has played  
this year. The Americans previously tied Bolivia 0-0 and beat Chile 
2-1. The Argentineans, who are favored to win this year's Copa 
America in Paraguay, will be a stern test. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Marcelo Bielsa's squad for Sunday's exhibition, however,  
does not include several standouts who were not invited, committed 
to other teams or declined to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The most notable absence is injured striker Gabriel Batistuta,  
who leads the Italian league in scoring and netted nine goals in 
the past two World Cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to know what you're going up against,'' said U.S.  
midfielder Tony Sanneh, who has been playing with Hertha Berlin of 
the German League. ``But we have a general idea of what formations 
they're going to play. Hopefully we can make them adjust to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arena has summoned eight American players from foreign teams and  
10 more from Major League Soccer rosters. The U.S. will use the 
match as preparation for the FIFA Confederations Cup in Mexico in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
	Arena returns to the area where he led D.C. United to MLS titles  
in 1996 and 1997. While he continues to rebuild the U.S. team, 
Arena insists that his job description no longer includes selling 
American fans on the world's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not playing marketer,'' he said. ``I have enough problems  
trying to develop a team. .. The best way of marketing soccer is 
putting a good team on the field.''

	US Accepts Russia's Kosovo Move  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States tried to put the best face  
on a dismaying hitch in plans for postwar Kosovo today, with 
predictions that NATO and Russian forces can work hand-in-hand to 
keep peace in the province. Russian troops beat NATO peacekeeping 
teams into Kosovo, stealing some thunder from the victorious 
alliance. The Russians, who arrived unannounced late yesterday, and 
the vanguard of a British force both occupied the key Pristina 
airfield. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Henry Shelton said 
the two forces had a cordial meeting.

	Russia, NATO Tension Reported  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Streaming into Kosovo's capital,  
almost unopposed by retreating Serbs, NATO peacekeepers came 
face-to-face today with the Russian troops who beat them to the 
city. A U.S. official said the two sides were running ``a 
coordinated occupation,'' but some reports described tense moments 
between NATO troops and the small Russian force. U.S. and Russian 
negotiators are working to design a formal job for Russia in the 
Kosovo peacekeeping force. But there was no immediate result and no 
sign the column was planning to leave, as Russia's foreign minister 
had promised.

	Three Killed in Michigan Shooting  
</P>
<P>
	BINGHAM FARMS, Mich. (AP) -- A psychiatrist who was gunned down  
by a man seeking treatment could have done little to help the 
severely disturbed patient, the doctor's family said today. Joseph 
Brooks Jr., 27, killed Dr. Reuven Bar-Levav and a woman and injured 
four others before killing himself at Bar-Levav's office yesterday 
afternoon. One of the wounded remained hospitalized in fair 
condition today. The gunman had been diagnosed elsewhere as a 
paranoid schizophrenic and had come to the office several times, 
said Dr. Leora Bar-Levav.

	Experts See Computer Virus Trouble  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Nervous calls to computer support lines dropped  
off sharply today after two frenzied days of combat against a 
software bug that attacks with the speed of the Melissa virus and 
the destructiveness of Chernobyl. Computer experts, however, feared 
that the spread of Worm.Explore.Zip will pick up again when 
employees return to work Monday, adding to the tens of thousands of 
machines infected with the file-eating bug. The virus, first 
detected June 6 in Israel, did most of its damage in the past two 
days, infecting computer systems at several big corporations.

	S. Korea Heightens Attack Alert  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Communist North Korea sent patrol  
boats across a disputed sea border today after threatening to 
attack South Korean warships in contested waters of the Yellow Sea. 
The American-led U.N. Command, which oversees the fragile truce 
between the two bitter rivals, urged North Korea -- for a third time 
this week -- to hold a border military meeting to end the standoff. 
The armed standoff in the Cold War's last flashpoint entered its 
fifth day today, with the two Koreas hardening their stances after 
their ships nearly opened fire yesterday.

	Former President Returns To Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the most vilified  
former Mexican president in recent memory, returned home today to 
the country he left in disgrace four years ago. The two-day trip 
was the first visit home for the man widely blamed for the crushing 
1995 peso crisis and recession. The tone of Salina's return stood 
in contrast to that of his triumphant departure from the presidency 
in December 1994, after six years of market-oriented reforms that 
his supporters said elevated Mexico out of the third world.

	Health-Care Coverage Grows for Pets  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A growing number of people are paying up to  
$6,000 for kidney transplants and chemotherapy for their pets. 
``And why not?'' said Michael Garvey, who chairs the Animal Medical 
Center of New York's emergency department. ``After a long hard day 
at work, your pet is always happy to see you. You can't always say 
that about all the people in your home.'' Garvey is one of about 
2,600 animal doctors in Chicago for a weekend conference on pet 
treatments unheard of a few years ago and still largely unknown to 
many pet owners.

	Dallas' Star Modano May Play  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dallas' high-scoring center Mike Modano,  
saying he is ``feeling a lot better'', is indicating he is ready to 
go in tonight's Stanley Cup finals game against the Buffalo Sabres. 
But Modano also said he would wait to see how he felt at game time 
before making his final decision. The series is tied 1-1. Modano, 
the Stars' regular-season leading scorer and all-around best 
player, hurt his left wrist when he was hit by Buffalo's Jay McKee 
in Game 2 on Thursday night.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Takes Momentum Into Kmart 400 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROOKLYN, Mich. (AP) -- It has been a trying year for Jeff  
Gordon. The NASCAR poster boy, winner of three Winston Cup titles, 
is suddenly mortal. 
</P>
<P>
	For some reason his Chevrolet -- the familiar No. 24 car -- has  
more days when it runs like a lemon off the used-car lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gordon appears to be the man to beat Sunday in the Kmart  
400 at Michigan Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon shattered his own track record with a qualifying lap at  
186.945 mph. That earned him the right to start on the pole, next 
to Ernie Irvan. Gordon, who has won the Cup points series three of 
the past four seasons, has finished sixth or better in his last 
eight races at this 2-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	And starting at the head of the pack frequently pays off at  
Michigan. In the 57 Winston Cup races held at the track since it 
opened in 1969, the winner has come from the first five rows 51 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	The pole winner has won 13 times.  
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to be able to run as fast as you can throughout the  
whole race,'' said Irvan, who won at Michigan in 1997. ``Obviously, 
when you're in the lead, you'll use a little more fuel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fueling decision may have cost Gordon a chance to beat Bobby  
Labonte to the finish line last week at Dover, Del. But it has 
mainly been a balky car holding Gordon back. 
</P>
<P>
	His car did not finish four of the season's first 13 races. That  
equals Gordon's DNFs for the past two years combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely been a trying year for us, a little bit,''  
Gordon said. ``We've had lots of success the past few years, and 
when you've had that kind of success you want to live up to those 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's awesome pressure to live up to those expectations.''  
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett, who leads the Winston Cup standings with 1,984  
points -- 51 more than Jeff Burton, knows exactly what Gordon is 
going through. Jarrett has chased Gordon the past three years, 
losing the Cup title by Gordon only 14 points in 1997 and finishing 
third last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to chase 'em down is always harder to me,'' Jarrett  
said. ``That's difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not impossible.  
</P>
<P>
	To equal last year's win total of 13, Gordon would have to win  
10 of the last 21 races in this 34-race season. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, after 13 races, Gordon ranked third in the standings.  
But he won 10 of the last 20 races. When the dust had settled, 
Gordon had 5,328 points and won the Cup series by 364 points over 
Mark Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	He is currently sixth in the standings, 339 points back.  
</P>
<P>
	``We look at where we're finishing,'' Gordon said. ``It says a  
lot for us to be sixth in the points and have that many DNFs. I 
think it just shows how well we are performing when we do finish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No kidding.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon won the Daytona 500, won the Cracker Barrel 500 and won  
the California 500. Last week, he finished second at Dover and 
climbed from eighth to sixth in the standings. It was his seventh 
top-five finish this season, all of which have been third or 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny how last weekend at Dover like all of a sudden  
we're back on track,'' Gordon said. ``Everything is clicking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might be bad news for the rest of the field.

<HEADLINE> Swimmer Takes Comeback Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Four-time Olympic gold medalist Amy Van  
Dyken won a 50-meter freestyle race tonight, her first competitive 
race since she had shoulder surgery last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken, 26, won gold medals in the 1996 Summer Games in the  
50 freestyle and 100 butterfly, and as a member of the 400 
freestyle and 400 medley relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
	But she injured her right shoulder while lifting weights on May  
10, 1997, and couldn't take a single stroke in the pool for months 
without significant pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken, the American record-holder in the 50 at 24.87  
seconds, was timed in 25.95 Saturday night during the Charlotte 
UltraSwim. It wasn't close to her personal best, but it fulfilled 
her modest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I wasn't going to have a good start because it hurts my  
shoulder a lot at the start,'' Van Dyken said. ``I usually build up 
(speed) during the race, and that's what I did. It looked like I 
was going to lose for a while, but I just kicked it into another 
gear, and it worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Van Dyken, who has aspirations of competing in the 2000 Olympics  
in Sydney, Australia, is working her way back into shape. Charlotte 
was a positive step, one she hopes will help land her a spot on the 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, it's just make the team,'' Van Dyken said. ``I  
took that first step this morning in making my Olympic trials 
qualifying time, which I didn't have going into this meet. I've 
made the first step, the next step is to work hard, see what I can 
do and whatever happens is going to happen.''

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Begin Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India and Pakistan launched talks today  
aimed at resolving hostilities that have been raging for a month in 
the disputed mountain region of Kashmir, heightening tensions 
between the two nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	With airstrikes and ground troops, India has been battling  
Islamic guerrillas who seized mountain positions in Kashmir in May. 
It accuses Pakistan of backing the guerrillas in a bid to alter the 
cease-fire line dividing the disputed territory between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan has denied any ties to the guerrillas.  
</P>
<P>
	Before foreign ministers Jaswant Singh of India and Sartaj Aziz  
of Pakistan entered talks today in New Delhi, both sides continued 
to trade accusations over the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions flared in the capital during the talks as well. Riot  
police stopped protesters from marching on the Pakistani Embassy. 
They burned effigies of Aziz and the Pakistani prime minister, 
shouting, ``Sartaj Aziz go home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said Friday that India's only objective was to persuade  
Pakistan to remove the forces and respect the Line of Control, as 
the 1972 cease-fire line is known. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kashmir, the Indian army continued shelling the seized  
mountain positions today. Officers in the state capital, Srinagar, 
said troops were engaged in close-quarters combat to recapture the 
icy mountains in the Batalik region of the cease-fire line. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Delhi talks were clouded by Indian accusations that six  
soldiers were tortured in captivity in Pakistan and their bodies 
were mutilated. Pakistan's army, which handed the bodies to India 
on Thursday, denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
	India also produced telephone transcripts between two top  
Pakistani generals it said support its claims the Pakistani 
military controls the guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
	India says Pakistani troops are among the insurgents. Pakistan  
denies those claims and dismissed the phone transcripts as 
propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
	But Singh said the tapes raise ``serious doubts about  
(Pakistan's) professed aim of defusing tension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan says the guerrillas are from Islamic groups fighting  
for Kashmiri independence from majority Hindu India. Aziz said 
India was overreacting to the guerrillas' offensive and was 
escalating tensions along the border. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over  
Kashmir, since they won independence from Britain in 1947. India 
controls two-thirds of the territory, and Pakistan has the 
remaining third. 
</P>
<P>
	Muslim guerrillas have been leading an 11-year insurgency in  
Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Shooting Outside Wal-Mart Kills Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A man critically wounded his ex-girlfriend  
and fatally shot her fiance outside the Wal-Mart store where both 
victims worked before killing himself, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting happened Friday afternoon in an employee parking  
lot near the store, but ``innocent shoppers were not targeted,'' 
police spokesman Dave Gouran said. 
</P>
<P>
	David M. Jones, 26, was killed and his fiancee, Robin Kerl, 24,  
was in critical condition at a Madison hospital with a gunshot 
wound to the neck. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, Harvey Pierce, 45, was dead at the scene.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones and Kerl were engaged to be married. Pierce was Kerl's  
ex-boyfriend and had made past threats against the woman, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Store customers were told to stay inside after the shooting,  
said Molly Rogers, who was waiting to retrieve her van. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in there maybe 10 minutes when we heard, `Attention  
Wal-Mart shoppers, due to uncontrollable circumstances do not leave 
the store,''' Rogers said. Customers ``weren't panicked about it, 
but everyone got real worried.''

<HEADLINE> Victory Gallop Wins Stephen Foster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Trainer Elliott Walden wasn't sure how  
Victory Gallop would fare in his first start since a third-place 
finish in the Dubai World Cup in March. 
</P>
<P>
	His questions were answered quickly Saturday as the 4-year-old  
winner of the 1998 Belmont Stakes ran 1 1/8 miles in a track-record 
1:47.28 to win the $827,250 Stephen Foster Handicap for 3-year-olds 
and up at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``This horse has been training just great,'' Walden said. ``I  
must have had 10 people come up to me the last two days and tell me 
I was a cinch just from seeing him train. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know about that Dubai thing. I've been waiting to  
run him and had been excited about it. Everybody wants to label the 
fact that they don't come back from Dubai well. I hope this puts it 
to bed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The advertised showdown between two former Triple Crown race  
winners eventually turned into a one-horse show. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Jerry Bailey and carrying 120 pounds, Victory Gallop --  
who finished second in the 1998 Kentucky Derby and Preakness to 
Real Quiet -- breezed past 1997 Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner 
Silver Charm in the stretch and beat him by 8 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-year-old gray, ridden by 1999 Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
winner Chris Antley and carrying a race-high 123 pounds, broke 
strong but flattened out in the final furlong in losing his fourth 
consecutive race. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just kind of ran an even race,'' said Antley, who was  
aboard the Bob Baffert-trained colt for the first time. ``I thought 
I had him in pretty good position but he just didn't fire when we 
needed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Victory Gallop, who earned $512,895, went off at 6-5 and paid  
$4.60, $2.60 and $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Nite Dreamer, who carried 110 pounds and was ridden by Pat Day,  
finished second, five lengths back, and paid $4.80 and $2.10. 
Littlebitlively, who carried 115 pounds and was ridden by Calvin 
Borel, was another three-quarters of a length back in third and 
paid $2.10. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Silver Charm were Precocity, Da Devil and Connecting  
Terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Littlebitlively, who lost by a head to Silver Charm in last  
year's Clark Handicap, dueled with Connecting Terms for the first 
three-quarters of a mile. As the field moved around the far turn, 
Nite Dreamer made his bid for the lead as Victory Gallop charged 
from the back of the seven-horse field to take the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said he was amazed by the power in Victory Gallop's  
stride as he took the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He dropped back farther than I thought he would, about 12 or  
14 lengths off the lead,'' Bailey said. ``He was content to be 
there until I pulled the trigger. And then it was the most powerful 
rush I've felt around a turn since I've been riding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigar made strong moves all the way in races, but when horses  
take off like that and make up the kind of time he did today, it's 
just devastating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ride was Antley's first major race since pulling up an  
injured Charismatic as the colt neared the finish line in the 
Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic broke two bones in his lower left foot and was  
retired following surgery to repair the damage. Veterinarians 
credited Antley, who jumped off and immediately picked the leg up 
to keep weight off it, with preventing more serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I truly feel revived because the horse is OK -- that was my  
biggest concern,'' Antley said. ``Charismatic has given me so much 
in my career and my comeback. ... He gave me some of my greatest 
moments ever. I felt something was wrong and what I did was simply 
instinct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Antley said Charismatic had been on his mind a lot since the  
Belmont but had no effect on the way he rode Silver Charm on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``New race, new horse, new beginning and a lot of hope,'' Antley  
said.

<HEADLINE> Home Improvement Chain Files Ch. 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARGO, Md. (AP) -- Hechinger Co., the home improvement chain that  
has struggled against Home Depot and other rivals, has filed for 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it will close 89 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will focus on 117 healthier stores in 21  
states. The reorganization plan announced Friday is subject to 
court approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported a loss of $228 million in the last quarter.  
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1911, Hechinger grew into a Washington, D.C.,  
institution and one of the first large home-improvement chains in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	By the early 1990s, however, it was clear that the Hechinger  
family had failed to recognize the threat posed by Home Depot and 
Lowe's, which were beginning to dot the suburbs with superstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Hechinger was sold two years ago for $507 million to Leonard  
Green &AMP; Partners, a Los Angeles investment group. Hechinger also 
combined Builders Square with two other chains to create the 
third-largest home-improvement chain. 
</P>
<P>
	But Home Depot and Lowe's have added stores and boosted profits,  
while Hechinger has struggled.

<HEADLINE> Some Birth Moms Fight for Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Jane's biggest fear is that the son she  
gave up for adoption almost 40 years ago will show up on her 
doorstep with a camcorder and questions she doesn't want to answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Who is my father?  
</P>
<P>
	Why did you give me away?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be very angry,'' she says. ``The idea of the adoption was  
to permanently sever the relationship with the child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane, who asked that her real name not be used, is among  
opponents of Oregon's voter-passed Measure 58, which would allow 
adult adoptees to see sealed birth certificates. Birth mothers fear 
that if a court challenge by six anonymous birth mothers fails next 
month and the law goes into effect, the information will be used to 
find them. 
</P>
<P>
	``The birth mother is quarry to be hunted down,'' Jane says.  
``There's nothing there to protect them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the law say existing registries already list birth  
parents who want to be contacted, so last fall's vote threatens 
only those mothers, like Jane, who want their pasts left 
unexamined. 
</P>
<P>
	As a senior in college, Jane became pregnant to a man she'd been  
dating only briefly. It was the early 1960s and abortion was 
illegal, but Jane found two doctors known to perform them. Both 
refused because Jane had a tipped uterus, making the procedure too 
risky. 
</P>
<P>
	Four decades later, Jane has no wish to tell her child he was  
born because she couldn't find an abortionist. Neither does she 
want her son disrupting her life, demanding explanations and 
casting her in a role she never chose. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really feel resentful that someone can come in and stake a  
claim on my life,'' she says. ``They want to sit down at the table 
and be a member of the family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case challenging open access to birth certificates is to be  
heard July 14 in Salem by Marion County Circuit Judge Albin 
Norblad. The six women who brought the suit claim they were 
promised confidentiality when they relinquished their children. 
</P>
<P>
	Their attorney, Frank Hunsaker, asserts Measure 58 violates a  
state constitutional provision against infringing on existing 
contracts because it wipes out promises of confidentiality made to 
birth mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Backers of the new law argue that no one had the authority to  
make such promises. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie, another birth mother who backs the plaintiffs, has -- at  
age 70 -- kept the story of her son's birth a secret for four 
decades. She sought an illegal abortion in the late 1950s but was 
told her pregnancy was too far along. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the years have gone on, it's kind of been like it was  
something that happened to someone else,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie's late husband already had children when they married, and  
she doesn't want her stepchildren to know she had a baby. But she 
also has concerns about the stranger who is her son -- her husband's 
investments left her comfortably provided for, and she worries her 
son might try to claim an inheritance or otherwise harm her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows what kind of person he is?'' she says. ``Who knows  
what he'd do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout the Measure 58 campaign, adoptees spoke out, often  
emotionally, about their searches for birth parents. Some who'd 
found their parents took reporters along to share the reunions. But 
the comparatively rare interviews with birth mothers paled in 
comparison because the women -- all anonymous -- so zealously guarded 
their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Marie recognizes that insisting on anonymity hurt the birth  
mothers' ability to shape the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the news stories are slanted against the birth parents  
and for the adoptees,'' Marie says. ``I wish there was some way of 
letting people know it's not out of being coldhearted. I pray for 
him, but I don't want to meet him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jane frames the birth mothers' insistence on privacy as a  
feminist issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Her generation missed the freedom provided by the pill and the  
legalization of abortion. Adoption was the only workable choice in 
a culture that scorned unwed mothers. Maintaining privacy, Jane 
says, is the only way such women can define their own identities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boys and Girls Aid Society of Oregon, one of the state's  
largest adoption agencies, supports birth mothers who wish to 
remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	``Promises that have been made to them in the past must be  
addressed with respect and honor,'' the aid society said in a 
position paper issued during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	But Madelyn Freundlich, executive director of the Evan B.  
Donaldson Adoption Institute in New York, says it's unlikely 
anonymity was promised to birth parents in most earlier adoptions. 
Decades ago, she explains, unwed mothers were often considered 
immoral and had no leverage to stipulate conditions for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
	Birth records were sealed to protect the adoptive families'  
privacy, she says, a practice that also concealed birth mothers' 
names. In various states, she says, plaintiffs challenging open 
adoption records have been unable to produce written promises. 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that any representation (about anonymity) was  
made, it was verbal,'' Freundlich says. 
</P>
<P>
	Freundlich says Oregon's unconditional access to birth records  
is an important test case. ``The eyes of many states are on 
Oregon,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy lives in Oregon but would not be subject to the law  
because she surrendered her daughter for adoption in another state. 
But passage of Measure 58 turned her into an anonymous crusader for 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy says her daughter was conceived in a ``terrifying, brutal  
stranger rape'' and that adoptees who want to use birth certificate 
information to contact unwilling parents are committing ``emotional 
rape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are brutally invading our lives,'' she says. ``... I'm  
just as innocent as the adoptee. For most of us, this is the most 
painful thing we have ever been through.''

<HEADLINE> Rosa Parks Visits N.J. School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- History became a little more tangible  
for the students at the Cicely Tyson School of Performing and Fine 
Arts when they were visited by civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks, 86, was arrested in 1955 for refusing to give up her  
seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Ala., bus. Blacks 
responded with a crippling boycott, which many consider the start 
of the modern civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Students threw roses at her feet as she entered the school  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rosa Parks sat down and said, `No. No. Enough is enough,' to  
make it possible for you to understand that there is not a human 
being on the face of the earth who can keep you from achieving,'' 
actress Cicely Tyson said as she introduced Mrs. Parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Parks, who lives in Detroit, is to receive the  
Congressional Gold Medal later this month. She was recently 
included in Time magazine's list of top 20 heroes and icons of the 
20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	Her visit was part of a celebration and fund-raising event for  
the school.

<HEADLINE> Cemeteries in the Way of Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLARKSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- She seeks them out in a red Ford  
Windstar, scouring winding streets and ceaseless subdivisions with 
a self-trained eye. In the ever-expanding sprawl of the Home Depot 
epoch, she searches for the history that hides in the folds of 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lois Mauk is looking for the dead, the buried. More often than  
not, she finds them. 
</P>
<P>
	She finds them behind long-forgotten fences, under overgrown  
brush and between houses, their tombstones stacked like rubble. She 
finds them penned carefully into corners of a military 
installation. She finds them paved over by asphalt, trapped under 
shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Once there was unrestrained wilderness here, grass and trees to  
the horizon. That was 1801, when Mauk's ancestor, a Revolutionary 
War veteran named Bazil Prather, landed with his large family on 
the Ohio River's north shore to find a new life. Like so many after 
them, they came to Indiana to build. 
</P>
<P>
	And Indiana got built. From the earliest pioneers to the  
farm-to-market visionaries of the mid-19th century to today's 
frenetic developers, the state constructed a society to fit the 
nickname it bestowed upon itself: ``Crossroads of America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But now, the builders of the past and the builders of the  
present are colliding. Indiana is still building, its suburbs and 
``exurbs'' pushing out, out, out into the farmland. All over the 
state, tiny pioneer graveyards sit in the path of the very progress 
so coveted by the people who rest in them. 
</P>
<P>
	The dead, it seems, are suddenly in the way.  
</P>
<P>
	And here in the land of the living -- at the build-and-move-on,  
newness-obsessed end of the 20th century -- stalwarts like Lois 
Mauk, descendant of one of southern Indiana's first 
farmer-builders, are their primary line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	A giant of the Earth was he,  
</P>
<P>
	To win his fields from stone and tree. ...  
</P>
<P>
	It took a giant, nothing less,  
</P>
<P>
	To wrest farms from the wilderness.  
</P>
<P>
	--from ``Farm Funeral,'' by Indiana poet Tramp Starr, 1941  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	From the beginning, they wanted to build.  
</P>
<P>
	They came from the east and the south, from ``civilization'' as  
the early 19th century saw it. They bought inexpensive land from 
the federal government and waded into a wilderness to shape their 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	They tore through forests, felling trees, clearing thickets and  
displacing Indians to carve farmland. They constructed houses, 
cobbled together communities, planted seeds agricultural and 
familial. 
</P>
<P>
	Progress was the buzzword, and Indiana's pioneers were the  
perfect army. When they died, they were buried in quiet corners of 
their land. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the generations kept on building -- beyond anything the  
pioneers could have imagined. Industry arrived. Houses sprouted. 
Main Streets became interstates. Farms became suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
	On one hand, development was the future's lifeblood, a legacy.  
But history, especially in a region that so revered its pioneers, 
was important, too. So a contradiction was born, a tension between 
past and progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana songwriter John Mellencamp saw it; he vowed to ``die in  
a small town, and that's probably where they'll bury me,'' then 
lamented the endless ``little pink houses'' and the guy who's ``got 
an interstate running through his front yard, you know he thinks 
he's got it so good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's Indiana still embraces growth. It has 1,138 miles of  
interstate highway, and more are in the works. America's biggest 
shopping-mall developer, Simon DeBartolo Group Inc., is based in 
Indianapolis. The state population grew by nearly 300,000 between 
1990 and 1996, 64 percent of it in rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Those people need places to live, and the countryside beckons.  
Between 1900 and 1992, Indiana lost 6 million acres of farmland -- 
28 percent -- to other uses, including development: The number of 
permits issued to build new, single-family houses has nearly 
tripled since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	It can be seen from the interstates at 65 mph: sub-cities rising  
on city edges; developments named after the things they overrun; 
signs along highway corridors beckoning homebuyers to visit 
skeletal neo-neighborhoods plopped down where crops once grew. 
``New Homes! A New Life!'' one enthuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Such sprawl -- spreading so fast that states from Utah to  
Pennsylvania are trying to curb it -- is, in this region, an 
expression of a time-tested philosophy: Building Indiana makes it 
better. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're still taming the wilderness here,'' says Dale Ogden,  
history curator at the Indiana State Museum. ``Then, you cut down 
the trees and planted crops. Today, you pave it over and build a 
mall or a domed stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In this fast-forward environment, what role is there for the  
eternal? Just what is meant by a final resting place in a place 
where nothing -- nothing except death -- is final? 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The traffic sweeps along its way  
</P>
<P>
	Where once a swampy wood-lot lay...  
</P>
<P>
	A car slows, and a voice inside  
</P>
<P>
	Says, ``Yeh, I guess some hayseed died.''  
</P>
<P>
	--Tramp Starr  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	To be buried in America today is, many believe, to enter  
sanctified space. From memorial parks to colonial graveyards, 
cemeteries are sacred locations in several senses -- religion, 
family and community identity. 
</P>
<P>
	For historians, genealogists and preservationists, old  
cemeteries are artifacts of architecture, attitude and art. 
Gravestones decode family relationships; Indiana's public libraries 
are filled with cemetery data painstakingly recorded by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cemeteries are also bastions of localism, visceral reminders of  
yesterday's citizens and how survivors remembered the dead. ``Show 
me your cemeteries,'' goes a saying that graveyard preservationists 
attribute to Benjamin Franklin, ``and I will tell you what kind of 
people you have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What do early Indiana's cemeteries tell of its people? That a  
cholera outbreak killed several Dillin family members in the 
southwestern Indiana hamlet of Ireland, and disease-wary 
townspeople sealed the graves in concrete. That patriot Nathan 
Hale's descendants migrated to southeastern Indiana. That many 
pioneer cemeteries were set on hills so the dead and the living who 
came to mourn could, on a clear day, see forever. 
</P>
<P>
	``These cemeteries are little individual museums,'' muses  
Delbert Himsel, an Ireland farmer who restores pioneer graveyards, 
including his ancestors'. ``Everywhere I go around here, there's 
some of my history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though many today consider cemeteries inviolable, the notion is  
relatively new. Graves have long yielded to development -- usually 
public development. Family graveyards in North Kingstown, R.I., for 
instance, were moved to a public cemetery to make room for a World 
War II military installation. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, America's old graveyards are squeezed by the worlds  
growing around them. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the suburbs today was the pioneer ground of my  
ancestors,'' says Jim Wilgus, a 34-year-old American Heart 
Association executive in Indiana. As a boy, he picked tiger lilies 
for his mother in an old graveyard that survived the rise of his 
suburban Indianapolis subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
	In Snohomish, Wash., an 1875 graveyard partially paved over by a  
road has been threatened by the construction of a youth center. In 
Castaic, Calif., bones from the family of a 19th-century pioneer 
oilman were unearthed by workers digging a new development. In 
South Carolina, historians think they've found the remains of a 
sunken Confederate submarine's crew -- near the end zone of The 
Citadel's football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In Indiana, preservationists say 19th-century cemeteries are  
under siege. They cite example after example: the Rhoads cemetery 
near the Indianapolis airport, where 35 children and eight adults 
were exhumed to build a warehouse. Wilhoit in Ireland, where a 
developer dug up remains and, following state regulations, had them 
removed to an Indianapolis anthropology lab. Hale-McBride in 
Clarksville, where bodies were partially paved over by a strip mall 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everywhere you live, you're standing on someone else's  
civilization. I know that. But I don't want these things to be 
destroyed for no reason at all. And money is not a reason,'' says 
Dan Johnson, a retiree who, with his wife Betty, spends days 
restoring old southern Indiana cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
	This swallowing up of resting places, and the injustice that  
preservationists feel it represents, is where the activism comes 
from. 
</P>
<P>
	It is why Hugh Dillin, a federal judge, demanded to know why his  
forebears' remains in Wilhoit were dug up. It is why Delbert Himsel 
has restored cemetery after dilapidated cemetery, mowing grass and 
reinforcing tombstones with caulk and steel before they topple and 
slip into the earth. 
</P>
<P>
	It is why Ashley Loweth, all of 8 years old and a descendant of  
Nathan Hale, rode from Clarksville to Indianapolis to tell 
legislators about her ancestors, the ones blacktopped by the 
shopping center and the others whose stones sit nearby, penned in 
by road and parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	And it is why Lois Mauk, paralegal and family historian in the  
Indiana suburbs of Louisville, Ky., is mobilizing Hoosiers to 
safeguard old graves and tighten laws. Her Indiana Pioneer 
Cemeteries Restoration Project has identified more than 160 
graveyards whose existences are imperiled, many by development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want someone to be able to say, `This is where my  
great-grandfather's buried,''' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Mauk's efforts helped enact a law barring farmers  
from plowing over old graveyards; future legislation, she hopes, 
will include developers and make it harder for the state to grant 
disinterment permits without advance public notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Developers ought to be able to, in every case they possibly  
can, work around the cemetery,'' says Markt Lytle, a funeral 
director and state legislator from Madison, Ind., He sponsored the 
new law and promises more to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Lytle realizes the importance of building. ``Sooner or later,''  
he says, ``some of these cemeteries in some of this development are 
going to have to be moved. But when they are, we want to make sure 
they're removed and replaced properly.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	No finer tribute can be paid  
</P>
<P>
	To any dead than this; he made  
</P>
<P>
	A barren field to bloom, his hand  
</P>
<P>
	Brought fruitfulness unto the land.  
</P>
<P>
	--Tramp Starr  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The red Windstar pulls into the shopping-center parking lot and  
Lois Mauk pops out. She is not pleased. 
</P>
<P>
	In front of her: Hale-McBride cemetery, or what's left of it -- a  
smattering of old stones on a bleak patch abutting Blackiston Mill 
Road. Telephone booths sit at its edge; a rusty shopping cart 
floats in a rivulet nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes me sick,'' Mauk spits.  
</P>
<P>
	There is, she acknowledges, a conflict of values here: How do  
you remember the past when the present is important -- and so 
immediate? Edge-city land is more economically valuable as 
developed property than as ancient boneyard. But what spiritual 
value does a cemetery hold? What does our treatment of it tell us 
about our place in the world? 
</P>
<P>
	``It is part and parcel of being a civilized society to show  
respect for these postage-stamp pieces of property in developments 
that are often so huge,'' insists John Herbst, president of Conner 
Prairie, a ``living history museum'' that depicts the Indiana 
pioneer era, circa 1836. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody's saying you shouldn't go ahead and do new suburbs if  
there's a need,'' Herbst says. ``But if you've got a 500-acre tract 
and less than an eighth of an acre of pioneer cemetery, you can 
incorporate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That is happening as the preservation and family-history  
movements gain strength and as the so-called ``smart growth'' 
approach -- developers consulting with communities rather than 
simply building -- becomes more common. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good developers, the ones who are thoughtful, have already  
figured this out: Give the people a voice,'' says Michael 
Pawlukiewicz, director of environmental land use policy at the 
Urban Land Institute, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
	In Union, Ohio, northwest of Dayton, a developer who built a  
neighborhood around the Sweet Potato Ridge Road Cemetery in 1997 
promised to preserve it. At the Avondale Mall in Decatur, Ga., a 
small stone building surrounds the graves of Crowley Cemetery; 
visitors can view the parking-lot burial ground by asking mall 
security for a key. And in Jim Wilgus' old subdivision near 
Indianapolis, the little family cemetery is still protected by 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana developers like Greg Furnish, encountering more graves  
than ever as they build outward, are working with municipal 
governments and preservationists to find middle ground. Furnish's 
firm is developing 164 houses on an old family farm outside 
Clarksville, and plans to build around three old graves. 
</P>
<P>
	Three old graves of pioneers who were builders of Indiana, and  
thus, have something in common with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a small piece of the pie to keep everybody happy,''  
Furnish says. ``That cemetery was there way before we got there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Mauk, ``the stones on these graves are the only evidence  
these people existed. If we can't respect the dead, how can we 
respect the living?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She plans to be out there on the city edges for years to come,  
hacking through the brush to reach long-neglected graves. She'll 
write down names, maybe speak them aloud. She'll rally troops to 
preserve the bones of community and memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Because this is the earth where she wants to be buried. She  
wants to return to the ground that swallowed her ancestors, that 
contains her mother and pioneers like Bazil Prather -- the ancestor 
who fought to build a home on land that, true to Indiana heritage, 
now sprouts houses as fast as it once sprouted corn. 
</P>
<P>
	She wants descendants to visit, to look upon her gravestone,  
maybe to think of her from time to time. She wants, eventually, to 
rest in peace. 
</P>
<P>
	And when that happens, Lois Mauk would prefer not to be moved.

<HEADLINE> Driver in Deadly Crash Gets 7 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JANESVILLE, Wis. (AP) -- A van driver who pleaded guilty to  
vehicular homicide in a crash that killed seven members of a 
cross-country magazine sales crew has been sentenced to seven years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of the victims criticized Friday's sentence given to  
Jeremy Holmes, 20, of Clinton, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	``He got one year for my brother's death,'' said Jessica  
Christman of Virginia Beach, Va., the sister of Peter Christman, 
18. ``I'm going to live with his death for the rest of my life. 
That's not enough for what he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, who faced up to 21 1/2 years in prison, wept.  
</P>
<P>
	``Your honor, there's a lot that I could say about how I feel,  
and I do take responsibility for the actions,'' Holmes said in a 
halting voice. ``What it comes down to -- I'm sorry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said Holmes tried to switch places with a  
passenger because he had been spotted speeding and was driving 
without a valid license. 
</P>
<P>
	The van was carrying 14 young people on March 25 when it veered  
off Interstate 90 at 80 mph and rolled near Janesville. Twelve 
people were thrown from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had been selling magazine subscriptions door to door  
and was on its way back to a hotel. All of those aboard worked for 
YES, which recruits young people and sends them traveling the 
country selling subscriptions processed under a contract with a 
company called Subscriptions Plus. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes also was ordered to pay about $492,000 to victims and  
their family members while he serves probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Public Defender Brenna Lisowski said Holmes should not have to  
spend any time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consequences of this accident are beyond tragic, but the  
person who is sitting before you is not essentially a criminal,'' 
Lisowski said. ``It wasn't as though he was out joy riding.''

<HEADLINE> 'Scream' Stars Wed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- ``Friends'' actress Courteney Cox wed actor  
David Arquette on Saturday while hundreds of fans stood outside the 
church hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple and their celebrity 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
	The marriage took place at Grace Cathedral, followed by a party  
at a 1930s speakeasy-style club where the newlyweds and 250 guests 
drank Dom Perignon and dined on steak and lobster. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cox wore a white Valentino dress.  
</P>
<P>
	Among those who attended were ``Friends'' actress Jennifer  
Aniston and her boyfriend, Brad Pitt; actor Richard Benjamin and 
his wife, Paula Prentiss; and Paul ``Pee-Wee Herman'' Reubens. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple met on the set of the 1996 horror comedy ``Scream''  
and appeared together last year in the film's sequel. Arquette, 27, 
proposed to Ms. Cox, 34, on a Florida beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cox has co-starred on the TV show ``Friends'' since 1994.  
Arquette, the brother of actresses Patricia and Rosanna Arquette, 
recently appeared with Drew Barrymore in the film ``Never Been 
Kissed.''

<HEADLINE>  USOC Displays FloJo Memorabilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Eight-year-old Mary Ruth Joyner,  
her long black hair neatly braided, clutched her stuffed bear 
``Ted'' and watched intently as her mom settled into the starting 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Florence Griffith Joyner was about to dazzle the world again  
with her speed, style and grace. 
</P>
<P>
	The video footage of ``FloJo'' winning three gold medals in the  
1988 Olympic Games is part of a tribute to Florence Griffith Joyner 
that went on display Friday night at the U.S. Olympic Training 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner died last Sept. 21 at age 38 when she was stricken with a  
seizure as she slept at her home in Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always hard for me to sometimes see Florence run again  
and know that she's still has the family record,'' her husband, Al 
Joyner, said. ``I'm going to try to get it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Joyner played an important part in the tribute, donating the  
art kit that FloJo used to decorate her long, dazzling fingernails. 
Also on display is the hand torch she carried in the '88 Games in 
Seoul, South Korea, and an action figure depicting her as she 
bolted from the starting blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that makes the figures, Starting Lineup, sent the  
model to FloJo because she wanted to paint it herself to ensure the 
skin tone, hair color, white shoes and red uniform were just right.

	``I wish she was here to see it,'' Joyner said as he walked  
among the poster-sized pictures and glass displays. ``She probably 
would have wanted more fingernail shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since her death, several tributes have been paid to Joyner, who  
still holds world records for the 100 and 200 meters, but Al Joyner 
said the U.S. Olympic Training Center has special meaning for the 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is where dreams start,'' he said, ``but this is also  
where they continue to live. You know what it feels like to train, 
but when somebody else thinks you deserve it, that's the highest 
honor they can bestow on you. You can't train for that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The display will be open to the public at the U.S. Olympic  
Visitor Center until Aug. 13. It includes clothing that FloJo 
designed as well as books she wrote and the U.S. team ring she 
received in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted it to be colorful and lively -- just like she was as a  
person,'' said Erica Hutchinson, who arranged the display. ``Al 
said he enjoyed it. That's what means the most to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl called the tribute  
one of the proudest moments in his two terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we admire her, but we really see a person who has  
made a difference in the lives of young women and young men who are 
looking for direction,'' Hybl said. ``Her impact goes on.''

	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Eight-year-old Mary Ruth Joyner,  
her long black hair neatly braided, clutched her stuffed bear 
``Ted'' and watched intently as her mom settled into the starting 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Florence Griffith Joyner was about to dazzle the world again  
with her speed, style and grace. 
</P>
<P>
	The video footage of ``FloJo'' winning three gold medals in the  
1988 Olympic Games is part of a tribute to Florence Griffith Joyner 
that went on display Friday night at the U.S. Olympic Training 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Joyner died last Sept. 21 at age 38 when she was stricken with a  
seizure as she slept at her home in Mission Viejo, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always hard for me to sometimes see Florence run again  
and know that she's still has the family record,'' her husband, Al 
Joyner, said. ``I'm going to try to get it back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al Joyner played an important part in the tribute, donating the  
art kit that FloJo used to decorate her long, dazzling fingernails. 
Also on display is the hand torch she carried in the '88 Games in 
Seoul, South Korea, and an action figure depicting her as she 
bolted from the starting blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company that makes the figures, Starting Lineup, sent the  
model to FloJo because she wanted to paint it herself to ensure the 
skin tone, hair color, white shoes and red uniform were just right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish she was here to see it,'' Joyner said as he walked  
among the poster-sized pictures and glass displays. ``She probably 
would have wanted more fingernail shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since her death, several tributes have been paid to Joyner, who  
still holds world records for the 100 and 200 meters, but Al Joyner 
said the U.S. Olympic Training Center has special meaning for the

<HEADLINE> Stars Lose Hull to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Brett Hull, one of the Dallas Stars' top  
scorers, strained a groin muscle in the first period of Saturday 
night's 2-1 victory over the Buffalo Sabres in Game 3 of the 
Stanley Cup finals and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a pulled groin and he is day-to-day,'' Stars coach Ken  
Hitchcock said. ``This is the same injury that he has had twice 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time (he) had it, he was right back 24 hours later.  
Next time, it was seven days before he came back. So we are not 
really sure right now. We can probably give you a better evaluation 
in a day or two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hull played only about two minutes of the first period, taking a  
big hit from Buffalo's Alexei Zhitnik. 
</P>
<P>
	Hull has seven goals and seven assists in 19 playoff games,  
including two goals in the first two games of the finals. He scored 
the game-winner in the Stars' 4-2 victory on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to Saturday night's game, he had a team-high 13 shots.  
During the season, he had 32 goals to rank behind two behind team 
leader Mike Modano. Hull also had 26 assists.
