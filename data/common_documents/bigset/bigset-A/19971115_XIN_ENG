<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The German industrial holding
conglomerate Viag said today its pre-tax profits reached 2.19
billion marks (1.27 billion U.S. dollars) in the first nine months
this year, up 20 percent over the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerate's turnover in September rose 18 percent to
36.58 billion marks. Viag expected the overall figure for the year
1997 would top 50 billion marks.
</P>
<P>
The turnover growth was achieved despite some early start-up
losses in telecommunications operations, and half the growth came
from newly-acquired holdings during the period in which it had
invested 6.1 billion marks, Viag said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from telecommunications, Viag also has stakes in energy,
chemicals, packaging, and logistics companies.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Launched by Chinese Rocket Passes In-Orbit Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A telecommunications
satellite launched by a Chinese rocket for APT Satellite Holdings
Limited, a Hong Kong-based major satellite operator in the
Asia-Pacific region, passed all the in-orbit tests today and will
commence commercial operations soon.
</P>
<P>
A reception was held today at Hong Kong's JW Marriot Hotel to
mark the successful launch of the APSTAR IIR satellite, which was
launched accurately into orbit on October 17 by the powerful Long
March 3B launch vehicle of the China Great Wall Industry
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was then successfully stationed at 76.5 degree
East Longitude on October 27. The in-orbit tests finished today
showed complete compliance with each prime specification and that
the satellite was ready for normal operation.
</P>
<P>
This was the third flight of the Long March-3B (LM-3B) rocket
and the second success since August of this year. Up to now, China
Great Wall Industry Corporation has signed 26 foreign launch
service agreements and successfully launched nine
telecommunication satellites.
</P>
<P>
APSTAR IIR is a high powered satellite manufactured by Space
Systems/Loral of the United States and has a mission life of 15
years.
</P>
<P>
The satellite has 28 C-band and 16 Ku-band transponders at TWTA
power level of 60W and 110W respectively.
</P>
<P>
Being equipped with high EIRP (equivalent isotropic radiated
power) value and the more reliable Ku-Band transponders, the
satellite is able to transmit TV programs directly to the densely
populated areas covered by the bandwidth, which lays the
foundation for future direct broadcasting satellite services.
</P>
<P>
APT Satellite Holdings Limited presently owns three in-orbit
telecommunications satellites, APSTAR I, APSTAR IA and APSTAR IIR,
altogether 92 transponders and provides satellite broadcasting
services to over 100 countries throughout most of Asia, Europe,
Africa and Australia, reaching approximately 75 percent of the
world's total population.
</P>
<P>
The Long March 3B (LM-3B) launch vehicle is the most powerful
of the Long March series and is capable of launching a payload of
up to five tons into geo-synchronous transfer orbit (GTO).
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), attended the reception and extended
his congratulations to the three companies.

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- India has agreed to gradually
lift import restrictions on the European Union (EU)'s
agricultural, industrial and textile products, a press release
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The settlement came as the culmination to negotiations between
the two sides after the EU requested mediation consultations under
the World Trade Organization (WTO) in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
India will phase out the restrictions over a six-year period
and a substantial number of EU's exports will be liberalized
within the first three years, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
"We are very satisfied with this settlement," said Leon
Brittan, vice-president of the EU's executive body European
Commission. He added that the settlement "represents a significant
improvement in market access for EU exporters and means EU
priority products are ensured early liberalization".
</P>

The EU is the main trading partner of India, which has
maintained import restrictions on a large number of products for
close to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
The EU-India trade in 1996 totalled 18.483 billion ECUs (about
24,000 million U.S. dollars), representing a growth of 85.3
percent since 1991.

<HEADLINE> HK Economists Stand for Linked Currency System: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A number of Hong Kong
economists stand for maintaining the linked exchange rate system
between the HK dollar and the U.S. dollar, Financial Secretary of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's (SAR) government
Donald Tsang said today.
</P>
<P>
After his two-hour meeting with a group of senior academic
experts here, Tsang told reporters that the 10 economists believed
that maintaining the link would not only be instrumental to the
SAR's future growth and in fact would enhance its competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very good exchange, two hours. They gave me a lot of
very interesting ideas," he said. "But one thing which is quite
unanimous among our academics was that it was utterly important
from Hong Kong's position as an international financial center to
maintain the linked exchange rate system."
</P>
<P>
"They believed that we have the technology, we have the
expertise, we have the resources and the determination to defend
the link," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the meeting focused on "the various
activities in the currency market and the turbulence in the
currency market" in Hong Kong and the Southeast Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that they mainly discussed whether the
SAR government needs to defend the 14-year-old linked exchange
rate system and how it may stabilize the local stock market facing
challenges from international speculators.
</P>
<P>
Tsang also told reporters that his colleagues will discuss in
details with the economists the "technical matters" including the
"currency board system" and "the way for dealing with the
speculators."
</P>
<P>
Since the turbulence occurred in the local stock market in late
October, the SAR government has repeatedly voiced its
determination to defend the peg system between the HK dollar and
U.S. dollar and described the SAR's economic fundamentals as good.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today vetoed a congressional rejection of his line-item veto on 38
military construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Last month Clinton for the firs time used the line-item
authority, a power that the president can use to veto individual
spending items in bills, to delete 38 projects in 24 states worth
287 million U.S. dollars from the fiscal 1998 military
construction spending bill.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "The projects in this bill would not
substantially improve the quality of life of military service
members and their families."
</P>
<P>
Then the Senate voted to disapprove of Clinton's veto of 36 of
the projects and the House voted to restore all the 38. As a
congressional version to kick the ball back to the president, the
Senate then agreed with the House to fully restore the projects.
</P>
<P>
The Republican-dominated congress will not let the matter over.
It can still override his veto with two-thirds votes in the House
and Senate when it resumes session next year.

</P>
<P>
"I thought it was appropriate under the circumstances," Clinton

</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United Nations made the correct decision in
withdrawing all the U.N. weapons inspectors in protest against
President Saddam Hussein's order to expel American inspectors
within the U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is how to stop Saddam Hussein from

Clinton said the United States also supported the U.N. decision

<P>
Asked whether the withdrawal of the U.N. inspectors meant the
Iraqis got his way, Clinton said it would be a mistake to say
that.

"If his objective is to lift the sanctions, he has undermined
that objective,," he said. "The sanctions will never be lifted as

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Pick Up in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. producer prices
rose by slight 0.1 percent in October, indicating that inflation
at the wholesale level nearly disappeared, the Labor Department
reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Prices paid for finished goods to producers such as food
processing plants and auto factories inched just 0.1 percent
higher, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The monthly situation follows a sharp 0.5 percent jump in
September and a moderate 0.3 percent rise in August. The increases
came after seven consecutive declines, a post World War II record.
</P>
<P>
The Producer Price Index has declined at a 1.2 percent annual
rate for the first 10 months of this year, compared with a 2.8
percent increase during all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Inflation has remained remarkably low this year, despite robust
growth and the lowest unemployment in 24 years. Some economic
analysts are predicting the financial chaos in Southeast Asia will
work to contain the prices of some commodities and goods next
year.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Price Index, which includes service costs in
addition to retail goods prices, hasn't actually fallen, because
it more fully reflects rising wages. But it's increased at an
annual rate of just 1.8 percent through September.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, the wholesale level has recorded a sharp
decline in energy costs from January through May. However, even
excluding volatile food and energy costs, the producer index for
finished goods increased at only a 0.3 percent annual rate through
October, compared with a 0.6 percent increase for all of last
year.
</P>
<P>
In October, prices excluding food and energy were unchanged.
The seasonally adjusted price of new cars shot up 0.7 percent, but
prices fell for trucks, footwear and health products.
</P>
<P>
Energy costs rose only 0.1 percent in October. Gasoline fell
3.6 percent, but heating oil rose 2.1 percent; residential natural
gas, 2.9 percent, and electric power, 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose 0.4 percent. Vegetables soared 16.8 percent,
with cauliflower up 269.7 percent and broccoli 108.1 percent.
Fruit prices rose 4.2 percent, pushed by a 63.2 percent increase
in raspberries and a 20.6 percent jump in table grapes.
</P>
<P>
But eggs fell 10 percent; pork 6.4 percent, the most in nearly
a decade; chicken 1.3 percent, and beef and veal 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, intermediate prices rose 0.3 percent and crude goods
costs 0.6 percent, mostly because of big jumps in natural gas and
crude petroleum.

provide a good opportunity for deepening understanding of the two
peoples and improving DPRK-Japanese relations, said Kim Yanggon, a
senior official of the DPRK's Workers' Party of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation is composed of officials from the
Liberal Democratic Party, which is led by Japanese Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, and its two allies -- the Social Democratic
Party and New Party Sakigake. It is the first Japanese official
mission dispatched to Pyongyang in two and a half years.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Invests in Rolls Royce's New Engines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The British Government provided
200 million pounds (320 million US dollars) in financial support
to Rolls-Royce to help develop a new generation of aero engines.
</P>
<P>
The decision was seen as an encouraging pointer to British
Aerospace's plea for a contribution towards the cost of providing
the wings for a longer-range version of the A340.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the investment, John Battle, the industry minister,
said Thursday that the money was being advanced as a long-term
investment on which the government expected to earn "a commercial
rate of return."
</P>
<P>
The long term investment over the next four years to
Rolls-Royce plc towards the design and development of their
important new range of Trent engines will extend the Trent family
to enable to power all of the world's new large aircraft, Battle
said.
</P>
<P>
The Trent 500 has been selected by Airbus Industrie as the
power plant for the new A340-500/600, in a privileged partnership
announced at the Pair Air Show in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is believed here that the government's support reflects the
importance of this project to the UK economy and the clearly
established need for public funds to enable it to go ahead.
</P>
<P>
However, Battle said that the taxpayer should receive a rate of
return comparable with what the company will earn from the engine.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the minister is also discussing the help for
Rolls with the European Union but feels it comfortably meets the
rules covering state investment.

<HEADLINE> Singaporean Official speaks of Financial Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's financial
deregulation plans will be based more on American and European
experience than on Japan's model, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien
Loong, who heads Singapore's financial sector review committee,
said today.
</P>
<P>
At the end of his five-day working visit to Japan, Lee Hsien
Loong told the local media that his trip gave him some insight
into the Japanese financial reform, the local TV stations
reported.
</P>
<P>
Lee was briefed by Japanese Vice Minister of Finance Eisuke
Sakakibara on Japan's financial deregulation during the visit.
</P>
<P>
Lee said early this month that Singapore would review its
financial services sector, stressing that with the industry in a
stronger position to take risks, the emphasis should shift from
regulation to supervision that would deal differently with good
and bad institutions.
</P>
<P>
The proposed financial sector reform would be carried out not
in a big bang way, but more as a series of thunderclaps beginning
next year, he said last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Before winding up his Japan trip, Lee said that Singapore is
studying some Japanese reform such as allowing cross activities
and loosening control on fee and payment structures.
</P>
<P>
But overall, he said he felt Japan's situation is different
from Singapore's as the Japanese financial system is much bigger
and more regulated.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, American and European financial sector changes are
more relevant as they are more technological than regulatory in
nature.
</P>
<P>
Particularly noteworthy, Lee said, is the structural changes
resulting from the banking and financial institution mergers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Drop 0.2 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. retail sales went
down by a 0.2 percent in October, the second monthly straight
decline, the Commerce Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
The department noted that sales totaled a seasonally adjusted
213.7 billion dollars, as compared with 214.1 billion dollars in
September. But excluding the drop in autos, sales were up 0.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Sales in September were revised from an initially reported 0.3
percent advance to a 0.1 percent decline. From June to August,
sales had risen for three months.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales account for about one-third of the nation's
economic activity, and the recent sluggishness has caused some
concern over how robust the holiday shopping season will be. The
Christmas season often accounts for half of a retailer's earnings.
</P>
<P>
According to the department reports, sales of durable goods,
items such as furnaces and furniture expected to last more than
three years, plunged 0.9 percent after falling 0.8 percent a month
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Auto dealers also witnessed a 2 percent drop following a 1.4
percent decline in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
There was similar situation in other durable goods categories
as well. Sales of building materials and hardware were down 0.1
percent, while purchases of furniture and other home furnishings
were flat.
</P>
<P>
However, nondurable goods such as food and fuel managed a 0.2
percent gain on top of a 0.4 percent advance in September.
</P>
<P>
Department stores recorded a 1.1 percent increase, erasing a
0.4 percent dip a month earlier. Clothing store sales increased
0.9 percent, as against September's 1.9 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
Purchases at grocery stores were up 0.3 percent following a 0.7
percent gain a month earlier. Gasoline station sales rose 0.4
percent after a 1.5 percent increase the previous month. Drug
store sales advanced 0.7 percent, slower than the 1.3 percent gain
in September. But checks at restaurants and bars were off 0.3
percent following a 1.4 percent increase a month earlier.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Britain Moves to Exert More Pressure on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain stepped up its pressure
upon Iraq today by putting some British planes on alert as Prime
Minister Tony Blair warned the Iraqi government would make a
"severe mistake" if it continued to defy the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Armed Forces Minister John Reid announced in
parliament that the government would put a squadron of RAF Harrier
jets on a 48-hour alert as a "sensible precautionary measure."
</P>
<P>
This is the latest British military move following British
Defense Secretary George Robertson's announcement Thursday that
the British aircraft carrier Invincible would be sent to the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
The crisis between the United Nations and Iraq continued
worsening when Baghdad ordered Thursday all American arms
inspectors of the UN Special Commission on Iraq to leave the
country immediately.
</P>
<P>
Although Reid said no decision had yet been taken to send
either the RAF planes or the aircraft carrier Invincible to the
Gulf, local political analysts said that both moves were seen as
part of preparations to back any possible U.S. military action
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Force is not ruled out, of course. We are not ruling out any
options including the military option but we hope for a diplomatic
solution," Reid said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Blair reaffirmed Britain's tough
stance towards the Iraqi government by saying that he wanted to
"make it absolutely clear to Saddam Hussein that he must come back
in line with Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
"If he doesn't, then he's going to make a very, very severe
mistake indeed," Blair said. Downing Street sources said that
Blair would have a telephone conversation with U.S. President Bill
Clinton later this evening to review the latest situation.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook held
talks with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in
Edinburgh to discuss the latest development of the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Albright told reporters after the meeting that she had been
told Britain "is beefing up its forces in the Gulf" and they also
discussed measures "in which we could increase the pressure on
Saddam Hussein."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Cook, who expressed his country's
solidarity with the Americans, said that he still hoped a
diplomatic solution could be found despite the "grave" situation.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a future round of intensive diplomacy," Cook
said. "There is a sense of urgency. All options are open."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Orders 2nd Carrier to Gulf amid Rising Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid rising tensions with
Iraq after Baghdad expelled American inspectors, U.S. President
Bill Clinton today ordered the aircraft carrier George Washington
to leave the Mediterranean for the Persian Gulf to join the
aircraft carrier Nimitz, already deployed there.
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was appropriate under the circumstances," Clinton
said during a photo session with Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United Nations made the correct decision in
withdrawing all the U.N. weapons inspectors in protest against
President Saddam Hussein's order to expel American inspectors
within the U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
"The real issue is how to stop Saddam Hussein from
reconstituting weapons of mass destruction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States also supported the U.N. decision
to send a U-2 spy plane over Iraq this weekend. "Because if we're
not on the ground, it's important to be in the air," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the withdrawal of the U.N. inspectors meant the
Iraqis got his way, Clinton said it would be a mistake to say
that.
</P>
<P>
"If his objective is to lift the sanctions, he has undermined
that objective,," he said. "The sanctions will never be lifted as
long as he does not comply."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the U.S. goal was to "stop Saddam Hussein from
reconstituting his weapons of mass destruction." "Any specific
tactic will be designed to achieve that goal," he added.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the second U.S. aircraft carrier doubles the
number of American Navy warplanes in the Gulf, putting some 100
combat aircraft and another 50 support aircraft in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain ordered its aircraft carrier HMS Invincible
to Gibraltar from the Caribbean, Christopher Meyer, the British
ambassador to the United States, told CNN in an interview. The
British also put "a number of fighter-bomber aircraft" on alert,
the ambassador added.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Washington now wanted
the United Nations to continue bringing "proper pressure to bear
on Saddam Hussein to achieve compliance" with U.N. weapons
inspection resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Heart Checks Urged for Diet Pills Users in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Americans who
have taken fen-phen or Redux should get medical checkup now to see
if they develop symptoms of heart trouble, U.S. federal health
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Even if they feel fine, dieters who took the diet drugs at any
time should go to their doctor, according to recommendations
issued Thursday by the Food and Drug Administration, the National
Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
The new advice comes two months after fenfluramine -- the "fen"
in the diet drug combination fen-phen -- and Redux were pulled
from the market because they had been linked to potentially deadly
heart valve damage.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, 14 million prescriptions have been written for
fenfluramine or Redux, mostly for women. The government estimates
between 1.2 million and 4.7 million Americans have taken the
drugs.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary evidence from five surveys indicates that about 30
percent of those who used the drugs had heart valve abnormalities,
although most had no symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The government now has reports of at least 132 people who have
taken fenfluramine or Redux and have valve deformities. FDA
surveys suggest 30 percent of dieters with no symptoms might have
valve damage.
</P>
<P>
The new guidelines are an attempt to quell confusion until the
government learns more about fenfluramine and Redux, said Dr.
Murray Lumpkin of the FDA.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Publish New Highway Code in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Department of
Environment and Transport said that it is updating the country's
Highway Code to reflect current traffic practices and new concerns
about road safety.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports today said that a final version of the new
code will be published in the middle of next year to replace the
current one which was revamped in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The new code will spell out the dangers of using a hand-held
telephone and warn against being distracted by a hands-free set.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Road Safety Baroness Hayman said, "No one is
saying that you can't have a mobile phone in your car. It can be a
life-saver. It's how and when you use it that is important."
</P>
<P>
She warned that the government did not rule out the possibility
of legislation to ban using mobile phones while driving.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, drivers who argue with their passengers, fiddle with
the radio or eat a sandwich while driving on the road will also be
in breach of the new code.
</P>
<P>
Hayman, who is consulting the industry and motoring
organizations about the new code, said that she hoped the proposed
changes would make the code easier to follow.

<HEADLINE> Developing Countries Urged to Look for New Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The developing countries
should look for other sources of finance to support their
population programs in the face of dwindling funding from
traditional donor countries, a U.N. official said today.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) Nafis
Sadik told a press briefing here that some donor countries were
facing budget problems and had advised they would be cutting
their aid to the body.
</P>
<P>
"Japan, which is one of our biggest financiers, has just
announced that it is having budget problems because of the
situation on the international financial markets and would not be
able to continue providing funds for us," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sadik, who is in the country to attend the UNFPA Africa
Division Regional Meeting underway in Harare, said the meeting
would discuss how member countries could mobilize resources to
fund their population programs.
</P>
<P>
"We need to mobilize resources from bilateral donors at
country level and hope that the world bank will increase its
support of population programs," she said.
</P>
<P>
She hoped some developing countries in the Africa, Caribbean and
pacific bloc, which had included population issues in their proposals
for a new trade agreement with the European Union after expiry of the
Lome Convention in 2000, could secure funding from the union.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would also discuss progress on the implementation of
recommendations of the Cairo Population Conference.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Laments Erosion of Zimbabwean Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today expressed disappointment at the low level of
government support for arts, saying this was contributing to the
alienation of the Zimbabwean culture.
</P>
<P>
He was officially opening the Zimbabwe Heritage Exhibition '97
at the National Art Gallery in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said there was a tendency to treat cultural activities
as mere appendages to big social programs, thereby providing the
sector with meager resources.
</P>
<P>
As a post independent society, Zimbabweans continue to suffer
a "wound in the soul", as the long-term effect of cultural
debasement which colonialism contrived in order to facilitate
their subjugation.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the renowned Zimbabwean poet, Musayemura Zimunya, at
one point rightly described the indigenous people of this country
as cultural hollow men and women."
</P>
<P>
Pledging financial support for the development arts, the
president said, "it is only through a combined effort of our
population sectors that the future of both visual and performing
arts can be secured."
</P>
<P>
Efforts were underway to make art more easily accessible to a

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Currency Drops to Record Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's financial market
was today on the verge of collapse after the local currency
Zimbabwean Dollar (ZD) plummeted to a record low due to panic
importer demand of the U.S. Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) had to intervene in the
foreign exchange market to raise the Zimbabwean Dollar from an
all time low of 25 Zimbabwean Dollars before recovering to about
17 Zimbabwean Dollars to one U.S. Dollar compared with Thursday's
closing of 14.25 Zimbabwean Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Currency traders say they have seen huge importer demand
because the RBZ is short on reserves and is limited in the way it
can intervene. This has led to panic importation," said Sagit
stock brokers in an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors in recent days that Zimbabwe's foreign
currency had fallen to below two month's worth of imports.
</P>
<P>
Noted economist Joseph Muzulu attributed the depreciation to
importer demand, speculation and the fact that there was little
progress with regards to balance of payments support from the
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said speculation in the market that the Zimbabwean Dollar
would continue to depreciate and importers would benefit more if
they waited was also a contributory factor.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Seeks Dialogue with Security Council: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today urged the U.N.
Security Council to stop repeating American rhetoric and start
serious dialogue with Iraq to solve the current crisis over
weapons monitoring.
</P>
<P>
"It is useful, proper and logical to discuss how to start real
and serious dialogue with Iraq," Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed al-Sahhaf said at a press conference here Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
In a less upbeat tone, the foreign minister reiterated that
Iraq "seeks no confrontation with anybody," but a dialogue, even
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has taken the position that it was ready for serious
political dialogue with the U.S. without any preconditions since
April 1991 and it has maintained its position, al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only way which can be used by Iraq and the U.S. to
solve their differences," he said, adding a dialogue does not mean
Iraq backs off from its demands regarding the lifting of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq wants "its concerns and grievances heard and a dialogue
opened" to get rid of the seven-year-old crippling U.N. sanctions,
he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He rebuffed accusations that Iraq is trying to make use of the
current suspension of U.N. weapons inspection to produce
biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
The factories, labs and equipment under monitoring are
categorized as "of dual use" and are not capable of churn out
prohibited materials, and it takes months to produce biological
agents, as known to experts, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the Iraqi people, who gathered in presidential palaces
of Saddam Hussein to form human shields in an attempt to fend off
possible military actions, have now been around and inside many
factories, palaces, industrial compounds.
</P>
<P>
The forming of human shields has become a popular movement all
over the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The press conference came after U.S. President Bill Clinton
confirmed that aircraft carrier George Washington has been ordered
to join another aircraft carrier Nimitz in the Persian Gulf,
apparently to brace for possible conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The two-week-old standoff between Iraq and U.S. and UNSCOM,
which oversees elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction
is possibly coming to a showdown. Baghdad expelled six Americans
on the U.N. inspection teams hours after the Security Council
passed a resolution Thursday condemning Iraq's non-compliance and
interference in inspection missions.

development, cooperation and integration in the continent and to
establishing the African economic community as the most viable
framework for such development.''
</P>
<P>
He further said OAU has been cognizant of the need to work
together and to build a solid partnership with all organizations
and institutions concerned with the destiny of the African
continent and its peoples.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is attended by over 300 representatives of the
three million Rotarians in 29 different countries who have
arrived in Ethiopia to lend their services in the polio
immunization campaign which targeted 8.5 million children under

Addressing the meeting, President of Rotary International Glen
Kinross stressed the need to mount a global assault on poverty,
hunger, illiteracy and diseases.

</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Ethiopian Speaker of the House of the
People's Representatives Dawit Yohannes said the Ethiopian
government's main agenda is to ensure the economic development of
the country, and it is well aware that building a prosperous,
self-reliant society can never be achieved without guaranteeing
the Ethiopian child.
</P>
<P>
As children mean Ethiopia's tomorrow, he said, they should
have a healthy and promising environment and are "protected from
polio and other child killer diseases.''
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia yesterday launched its first nation-wide immunization
days against polio.

the United States and Britain will start a four-week long joint
military drill from Saturday, Kuwaiti Air Force Colonel Ali

</P>
<P>
Al-Kandari was quoted by the Kuwait News Agency as saying that

The crisis escalated after U.N. inspectors pulled out of
Baghdad today following Iraq's decision Thursday to order six
American members to leave Iraq immediately.

<HEADLINE> Government Slams Turkish Visit to Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
condemned a forthcoming visit by Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit to the northern areas of the island occupied by
Turkish troops.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit will be on the island Saturday with Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem to participate in "celebrations" marking the
15th anniversary of the establishment of "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash declared the breakaway
state in November 1983, a move the U.N. Security Council
described as "legally invalid."
</P>
<P>
Government spokesman Manolis Christofides said in his daily
news briefing that Ecevit "has returned to the scene of his crime
and (this) proves that crimes committed in Cyprus against
international law and order are carried out by Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Greek Cypriot students in Nicosia took to the
streets today to protest against continuing Turkish occupation and
formation of the regime in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A petition adopted by the students calls on the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council to exercise their influence
on Turkey "to change its intransigent stand and pave the way for
the reunification of Cyprus and its people."
</P>
<P>
Christofides said the government expected the protest rallies,
which it endorses and approves, to be within the bounds of
legality.
</P>
<P>
The police have taken strict security measures to avert any
incidents.
</P>
<P>
The eastern Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974
when Turkey landed its troops and took over the northern third of
the island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup seeking union
with Greece.

LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright expressed her hope here today that the
American strategy of diplomacy combined with military presence
would make Iraq change its mind.
</P>
<P>
Albright made the statement as tensions continued rising
substantially with Washington sending the second aircraft carrier
to the Gulf and London putting some of fighter planes on alert
following Baghdad's expulsion of American arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference after meeting with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon, Albright said, "Our
strategy is to combine intensive diplomacy with a robust military
presence in the Gulf which we are convinced is the best way to
convince Saddam Hussein to reverse course."
</P>
<P>
"Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction is
a threat to everybody in the region and they will not discriminate
if and when they are used," she added.
</P>
<P>
On the stalled Middle East peace process, Albright said that
she had told Netanyahu that "it is time to move the (Middle East
peace) process forward."
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is essential for both sides to live up to
agreements and not to make any steps that make it more complicated
to move the process forward," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who is on a round-the-world trip aimed at
revitalizing the deadlocked Middle East peace process, is to hold
talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Switzerland

<P>
LONDON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The gold price on the London
market today fixed at its lowest level in 12.5 years as unwanted
metal poured onto the market already saturated with bullion.
</P>
<P>
The price had briefly touched a low of 300.00 dollars per ounce
earlier today before finding some support and closing at 302.55
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"If it (300.00 dollars) starts to give, we could be looking at
290.00 dollars quite easily," said one dealer.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the focus of the market's increasing
distress has been the very public ruminations by central banks on
what to do with their gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
The gold price had surged to a high of 416.25 dollars in
February 1996, but has been in decline since then.
</P>
<P>
A survey of gold market analysts by Reuters earlier this month
found that the average gold price for next year was forecast
between 300.00 dollars and 325.00 dollars.

MOGADISHU, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Apart from human and
livestock fatalities, the floods that hit seven regions of
southern Somalia are also bringing about starvation and famine in
many flood-besieged villages and towns.
</P>
<P>
In Gedo, Middle Jubba, Lower Jubba, Middle Shabelle, Hiran,
Bay and Bakol regions of southern Somalia, life has become
difficult for hundreds of thousands of people in the flood
affected towns and villages as the food prices rose to five
folds.
</P>
<P>
The communication problems created by the floods are
sharpening not only the prices of the locally produced food items
but also the prices of imported rice and spaghettini.
</P>
<P>
These communication hindrances are also affecting the capital
Mogadishu with an increase of more than 50% in the prices of the
coal used for the cooking, milk, vegetables and butter which come
from these regions.
</P>
<P>
These disasters are taking place at a time when Somalia's
faction leaders are meeting in Cairo for a possible solution to
the long-standing political crises in the country which also made
it difficult for the international community to easily tackle the
flood problems in Somalia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Germany's electrical engineering
group Siemens AG announced today that it has acquired the
fossil-fueled power generation operations of the U.S. Westinghouse
group at a cost of 1.525 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the deal had been reached by the two companies
today, Siemens said, adding that the takeover had still to be
approved by anti-trust authorities in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Based in Orlando, the United States, the Power Generation
Business Unit of the Industries and Technology Group of
Westinghouse has a work force of about 8,000 and is an active
supplier in the international markets for gas turbine,
combined-cycle and steam power plants.
</P>
<P>
By acquiring the Westinghouse unit, Siemens, which currently
has an 11 percent share of the world market in fossil-fueled power
generation, will be able to outstrip the Swedish-Swiss group ABB
as the world's No. 2 in power generation business after the U.S.
General Electric (GE).
</P>
<P>
Westinghouse, once the second largest U.S. electrical group
after th GE, has been transforming itself into one of the leading
U.S. media companies in recent years after its acquisition of the
media giant CBS.
</P>
<P>
The last remaining industrial business of Westinghouse, namely
its nuclear power generation operations, would also be sold by
mid-1998, the company announced today.

<HEADLINE> Butler Hopes Inspectors Back to Iraq Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, chief
weapons inspector of the United Nations, said today he believed
U.N. inspectors, now pulled out of Iraq, would be back to
discharge their duties again.
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to believe that the international community is simply
going to walk away from the very large problem that is presented
by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction," he said in an interview
with CNN. "We'll have to be back, in one way or another, and as
soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Six American inspectors of the U.N. weapons inspection teams
left Iraq late Thursday following Baghdad's order of their
expulsion. And the other 68 U.N. team members also flew out of
Iraq Friday to Bahrein under the order of Butler in protest to
Iraq's expulsion of the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Butler said Iraq might be engaging in "dangerous and illegal"
activities in the absence of the U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We can't see exactly what's happening now in the way that we
could before, and so of course we are concerned with our backs...
that activities may be taking place that are dangerous and
illegal," he told CNN.
</P>
<P>
There are still seven U.N. staff staying in Baghdad, guarding
equipment in a monitoring center there and 12 Chileans who fly and
service U.N. helicopters.

Butler said the flights of U-2 spy planes would be more
important now with no inspectors on ground in Iraq. He emphasized
that while U-2 planes were U.S.-made and piloted, they were under
the jurisdiction of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis have said they would shoot down U-2 once found
flying over their territorial air. And the United States has vowed
to take retaliation if the Iraqis try to do so.
</P>
<P>
Butler hoped that the United Nations would take even greater
economic sanctions as the next step of warning. He said the new
punitive measure should "hit the spot."
</P>
<P>
"Sanctions are tough, they already are, and who knows, maybe
the (Security) Council will decide that more are required.
Whatever they decide it will have to be something that hits the
spot," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was necessary to "find a way to bring Iraq back to
its senses... and to get our monitors and inspectors back in the
country."

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Militias Accused of Breaching Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The military junta in Sierra
Leone, which is opposed to the disarmament of the armed forces,
has accused the hunter militias known as Kamajors of violating
ceasefire under a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Junta spokesman Aliu Kamara today claimed the Kamajors have
kept harassing civilians and vehicles as well as burning down
houses in the southeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
They are trying to capture a town in that area as their base
to fight against the junta, the spokesman told the British
Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors used to be hunters in the hinterland and have
fought for the restoration of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah since
he was deposed in the May 25 coup this year.
</P>
<P>
Repeated clashes were reported between the Kamajors and the
junta forces before the peace agreement was signed in Conakry,
Guinea, last month, which calls for ceasefire in that country.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, all people with guns, including
the Kamajors and the national army, will be disarmed and
President Kabbah is supposed to be reinstated in April next year.
</P>
<P>
The accusation came after the junta refused the demand of the
west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG for the
disarmament of the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The junta and ECOMOG held a two-day meeting near the capital
Freetown to search for modalities to implement the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
But the smooth development of the peace process suffered
setback as the two parties differed as to who should be disarmed,
among other issues.
</P>
<P>
By accusing the Kamajors of breaking the ceasefire, Kamara
said the armed forces of Sierra Leone will not launch any
military operation to check it.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the junta is waiting to see how ECOMOG, which is
responsible for monitoring the ceasefire and disarmament in the
country according to the Conakry agreement, is going to deal with
the situation, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
So far no response from ECOMOG is available.
</P>
<P>
However, a traveller back from southeastern Sierra Leone to
Freetown was quoted as confirming that the junta soldiers clashed
with the Kamajors starting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There has been no let-up since then, even as I left the area
on foot to join a vehicle at Kenema yesterday afternoon," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies said there was heavy fighting at Ngigeahun, where
several houses have been torched, according to a report reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors were rooted from the area in August by government
soldiers and former rebels now allied to the ruling junta.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development (IGAD) has appealed for humanitarian
assistance to flood victims in southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to an IGAD press release today, Kinfe Abraham,
director of political and humanitarian affairs of IGAD, said
after three weeks of disastrous flooding, international aid is
only now slowly reaching southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Aid agencies report that 450 people have drowned and 600
others are in imminent danger from rising waters, with 150,000
people displaced, 43 villages destroyed and 10,000 animals
killed.
</P>
<P>
The release said tens of thousands of hectares of land have
been inundated and 800,000 people are at risk of starvation and
diseases, particularly malaria and cholera.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims are reportedly living in trees to escape
the crocodiles, snakes and other animals competing for food and
dry land.
</P>
<P>
"Despera`e appeals are being made by the aid agencies for
transport, equipment and skilled personnel to help hundreds of
thousands of Somalis who are displaced by the floods," the
release quoted the director as saying.
</P>
<P>
Roads have been swept away and relief workers are trying to
reach the victims with food and medicines, some of which are only
accessible by boats, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Since the region's airstrip has been submerged, the aid
agencies are appealing for helicopters, the release added.
</P>
<P>
Somalia is a member of IGAD which also includes Djibouti,
Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda and the Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Annan Renews Appeal to US Congress for Payment of Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua)-- United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan today renewed his appeal to the U.S.
Republican-controlled Congress to approve the proposed payment of
American arrears to the world body.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, Annan said that he was
"disappointed" and "concerned" with the fact that the U.S.
Congress "did not act" on the legislation put forward by the
Clinton administration that "would have taken a significant step
toward funding the more than 1 billion U.S. dollars in overdue
U.S. payments to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"It is both unreasonable and regrettable that the legislation
was held hostage to the entirely unrelated domestic politics of
abortion," the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that the failure "comes during a week when the
United Nations Security Council had been seized by the crisis
regarding arms inspection in Iraq, in which the United Nations
plays a role that is indispensable to international peace and
security as well as to the vital national security interests of
the United States."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. owes a total of some 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to the
United Nations. The Clinton administration pledged that the U.S.
would first pay 1 billion U.S. dollars this year and the rest in
the next few years when Annan took the post early in the year.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the Organization was in a deep financial crisis,
the U.N. chief expressed the hope that the pledge of the Clinton
administration was still valid now.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged all member states to "take serious stock of our
financial vulnerabilities."
</P>
<P>
He said that he was asking the president of the U.N. General
Assembly to reconvene, as a matter of urgency, the Assembly's
high-level group on finance to explore all possible options for
ensuring prompt payment by member states of their dues, and to
report their recommendations before the end of the current session
of the Assembly."

make greater peace and reconstruction efforts and calling on the
international community to extend their helping hands.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, members of the Security Council agreed unanimously

<P>
At the end of the two-day meeting of the Inter-state Defense

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Boycott of Doha Not to Affect Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's boycott of the Middle
East and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference, due to open in
Qatari capital Doha Sunday, will not affect its relations with
Qatar, Egypt's ambassador to Doha Mohamad Meneissi said today.
</P>
<P>
Nor will it affect the treatment of Egyptians working in Qatar,
Meneissi told reporters shortly before leaving for Qatar at the
end of a week-long "vacation at home."
</P>
<P>
Meneissi said he was recalled by the Foreign Ministry back to
Cairo last weekend for consultations on means to restore the
"usual warmth in bilateral ties" with Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Their relationship was adversely affected by Egypt's criticism
of Qatar's insistence in holding the conference regardless
widespread Arab opposition, and by Qatar's decision to bar
Egyptian nationals from entering the country during the conference.
</P>
<P>
"The reason Egypt is boycotting the Doha conference is that
Israeli Premier Benjamin Netanyahu continues to refuse to listen
to the voice of reason and persists in his disregard for signed
agreements," Meneissi explained.
</P>
<P>
He said he met Foreign Minister Amr Moussa several times to
discuss ways to shore up Egypt-Qatar relations, adding he will
talk to Qatari "brothers" within the context of "continuous
understanding and consultation between the two sisterly countries"
in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador denied that Egyptian living in Qatar are the
targets of certain sort of harassment as a result of Egypt's
stance on the conference and that he is the subject of any press
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian ambassador ruled out Arab mediation to calm down
the situation between Egypt and Qatar. "The relationship between
the two countries is such that it would require no mediation
whatsoever," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not expect much from the Doha conference in
light of the massive Arab boycott. Most Arab countries, including
Egypt and Saudi Arabia, refused to send their delegations to the
meeting which also includes Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The conference is being held at a time the intransigent
attitude of the Israeli government has hurled back the peace
process to zero point and wreaked havoc on the outcome of the
three economic conferences in Morocco, Jordan and Egypt,"
Meneissi added.
</P>
<P>
The boycott camp views the gathering as a reward to the
Netanyahu government's hardline policy, held responsible for
bogging down the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> EU Delegation Visits Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
delegation visited Lebanon today on the fifth leg of its Middle
East tour aimed at reviving the stalled peace talks and playing a
larger role in the region.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jacques
Poos, whose country now holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
They held talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi and Foreign
Minister Fares Boueiz to discuss the regional situation,
especially in south Lebanon. The EU special envoy to the Middle
East Miguel Angel Moratinos was present at the meetings.
</P>
<P>
At a joint news conference after meeting with Boueiz, Poos told
reporters that their talks focused on two difficulties Lebanon is
facing - the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon and the 350,000
Palestinian refugees living in Lebanon, who make up one tenth of
the country's population.
</P>
<P>
"We reaffirm our support to the implementation of the
U.N. Security Council resolution 425 and demand Israel withdraw
from south Lebanon without any condition," Poos said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985, Israeli troops carved out a 1,200-square-kilometer
enclave in south Lebanon along the common border to buffer
cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern settlements.
</P>
<P>
Asked about proposed pressure on Israel, he said that if
pressure is used in tackling international affairs, it will only
bring negative results. The best way is through means of friendly
dialogue, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for the Palestinian refugees, he said a fair and lasting
peace couldn't be achieved if this problem is not resolved and any
solution to the problem should be based on the principles of
international laws.
</P>
<P>
Before arriving in Lebanon, Poos and his delegation visited
Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas and held
talks with their leaders.

Vedrine will visit Israel first as a symbolic gesture to turn

11.

Vedrine accused Netanyahu of adopting a "catastrophic policy"

UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council condemned again today the military coup in Sierra Leone in
May, 1997, which overthrew President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and
pressed the junta to restore peace and a democratic government.
</P>

According to a presidential statement released here today, the
Security Council showed its concern about the threat caused by the
coup to peace, security and stability in the region.
</P>

"The Security Council expressed its full support and
appreciation for the continued efforts of the Committee of Five on
Sierra Leone of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) to seek a peaceful settlement of the crisis and the
restoration of the democratically-elected government and
constitutional order," the statement says.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, it says, the Security Council welcomes the
peace plan agreed last month between the ECOWAS Committee and
representatives of the junta.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah already accepted the peace plan in his
statement of November 5.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also calls upon the junta to fulfil its
obligations under the peace plan, and in particular the ongoing
maintenance of the cease-fire, the statement says.

It reiterates the need for the provision and distribution of
humanitarian assistance in response to local needs, and calls upon

It urges all States and relevant international organizations to
continue to assist those countries dealing with the influx of
refugees caused by the crisis in Sierra Leone.

Meanwhile, the Security Council reminds in the statement all
states of their obligation to continue to comply strictly with the

Speaking to the reporters, President Udovenko said the

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Sign Land Mine Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister
Lloyd Axworthy today failed to take Lebanon into signing the
Convention to Ban Anti-Personnel Mines during meetings with
Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
When meeting with Axworthy, Lebanese Foreign Minister Fares
Boueiz said if Israel signs the treaty, it will become easier for
Lebanon to sign it. Lebanon is concerned about the issue, but it
is impossible for Lebanon to sign it while Israel is outside it,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berry expressed the same idea at
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon rejected the signing to the ban because the Islamic
resistance in the south uses anti-personnel weapons in its fight
against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy explained to reporters at a joint news conference
with Boueiz that the aim of signing the treaty is to help the
countries concerned remove the mines and provide victims with
financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy arrived in Beirut Thursday night on his ongoing tour
of the region aimed at drumming up support for the treaty that
prohibits the manufacture, trade and use of anti-personnel land
mines.
</P>
<P>
In addition to talks with Lebanese leaders, including President
Elias Hrawi, Axworthy went to the country's southern port city of
Saida Friday afternoon to meet with a group of children victims of
land mines.
</P>
<P>
Canada signed the treaty several months ago and destroyed its
last land mine last week.
</P>
<P>
A conference on the land mine ban will be held in Ottawa on
December 2-4 when those participating countries are expected to
sign the treaty. Canada hoped Lebanon can be among the first batch
to sign.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast tour has taken the Canadian foreign minister to
Egypt, Israel and Jordan, and will take him to Syria Friday
night.

<HEADLINE> Survey: One Million U.S. Women Stalked Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- More than one million women
in the United States are stalked every year and one out of every
12 women will be stalked at some point in their lives, a national
survey said.
</P>
<P>
The study released by the Justice Department Thursday also
reported that more than 370,000 men are stalked each year. The
majority of stalking victims of both sexes were between the ages
of 18 and 39. About 10 percent were under 18.
</P>
<P>
Of the stalking victims, 59 percent of women were stalked by
spouses, former spouses, live-in partners or dates, while 70
percent of men were stalked by "acquaintances" or strangers, the
study showed.
</P>
<P>
About half of the stalking victims told the police, the survey
said. And about 25 percent obtained restraining orders against the
stalker. One-quarter of the women who reported to the police said
the cases were prosecuted. Convictions were obtained in 54 percent
of the cases and 63 percent of the convictions resulted in jail
time, the study said.
</P>
<P>
The stalking data are part of a larger National Violence
Against Women survey being prepared by the Denver-based Center for
Policy Research, a private organization specializing in empirical
research on family violence.

<HEADLINE> Danish Wins OOCL Yachting Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 15 (Xinhua) -- After a tight-scheduled
final day, 1997 Oriental Overseas Container Line Ltd. (OOCL)
Etchells World Yachting Championships came to a close here on
Saturday, with Denmark's two-time Olympic champion Poul-Richard
Hoj-Jensen winning the top place of the final point standings.
</P>
<P>
But it was Australia's Noel Drennan, who won the trophy of the
three-year-long, four regatta OOCL World Series.
</P>
<P>
As Race 5 for Friday was postponed due to a lack of wind,
Saturday saw two races on the program.
</P>
<P>
The organizers were much worried as many of the overseas
sailors had booked air tickets for Sunday and only a light wind
was available today.
</P>
<P>
The 30-boat-strong, international fleet went out early today to
compete two shorter, nine miles races. Olympic bronze-medalist
Jeff Madrigali from the United States took the fifth race,
followed by Hoj-Jensen and another American Steve Wright.
</P>
<P>
It was Australian Colin Beashel, a two-time Etchells world
champion and America's Cup veteran, who finally had his first, in
Race 6. Hoj-Jensen was second again and Wright took another third.
</P>
<P>
After the sixth and final race, Hoj-Jensen was ranked atop the
final points standings, followed by Colin Beashel, Drennan,
Australia's America's Cup winner John Bertrand and Madrigali.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the organizing committee were lucky to get both
races completed, which guaranteed a on-time conclusion of the
World Championships.
</P>
<P>
However, Drennan, with his third overall in the OOCL World
Championships, second in the Hong Kong, China Championships
earlier this month, and second in the 1996 OOCL Fifth Asia Pacific
Championships, took away the OOCL World Series trophy. The OOCL
World Championships is the last leg ofthe World Series.
</P>
<P>
The world championships attracted a field of thirty boats and
91 sailors from six countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian PM Ends Visit to Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 15 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Prime Minister
Haris Silajdzic wrapped up his two-day official visit here today,
during which he held talks with Kuwait leaders on strengthening
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said in an interview with local Kuwait news
agency Kuna before leaving "We wish to promote economic ties with
Kuwait as our political relations are already strong."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait and Bosnia have similarities as to geography, population
and military force, he said, expressing hope that superpowers
would restore security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the two countries have potential in further
developing economic and trade ties on an even footing, noting that
Bosnia is rich in its sufficient and skillful workforce as well as
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Silajdzic held talks with Kuwaiti Amir
Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and Crown Prince and Prime
Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
He praised the positive and supportive stance of Kuwait to
Bosnia during the civil war in former Yugoslavia. The Kuwaiti
leaders, on their part, expressed thanks for his calling on Iraq
to comply with the U.N. resolutions adopted since it invaded
Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait was among the first countries to welcome the
independence of the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina from the
former Yugoslavia in April 1992 and recognized it as an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
In January 1993, Kuwait and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina
announced the establishment of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti cabinet of ministers last Wednesday expressed the hope
that Silajdzic's visit would contribute to substantiating the
"already deep-rooted relations" between the two friendly
countries.

MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus said here today that he saw
no need to extend an IMF program for the Philippines despite
concerns that Manila failed to fulfill key conditions.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any merit in extending the program," Camdessus
said at a press conference. He was in the country following visits
to Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The exit of the Philippines from the IMF tutelage is "not at
all a problem" since the IMF program is due to expire at the end
of this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has been hoping to graduate from the IMF after
35 years of being put under the IMF economic stewardship.
</P>
<P>
However, its scheduled exit in December was put in doubt when
the country's Supreme Court announced an oil deregulation law
"unconstitutional".

WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton dispatched an aircraft carrier to join
another already in the Persian Gulf in an attempt to signal that
the United States did not take lightly Iraq's expulsion of six
American members on an international weapons inspection team.
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright had talks with
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel in London, during
which she called on Israelis and Palestinians "to move on the
peace process." She will meet the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat
on her way to a Middle Eastern economic conference in Qatar that
major Arab nations are boycotting.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- Congress's refusal to pay almost 1 billion dollars owed by
the United States to the United Nations hit here like a hurricane
today, unleashing fears that the world body will run out of money
in 1998 and all but sinking the Clinton administration's hopes of
getting the U.S.share of the U.N. budget reduced from 25 percent
to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton signed Friday a 13.8 billion dollar
Interior Department appropriations bill that clinches a pair of
hard-fought environmental victories for the White House while also
expanding a number of federal timber programs bitterly opposed by
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
Herald Tribune
</P>
<P>
-- While U.S.-led military action has succeeded before in
thwarting President Saddam Hussein of Iraq when diplomacy has
failed, the challenges raised by Saddam's defiance this time make
the use of force more problematic, according to administration
officials and outside specialists.
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary-General Kofi Annan assailed Congress and the
anti-abortion lobby in the United States on Friday for killing a
plan to pay the United Nations more than 1 billion dollars in back
dues, calling the vote "unreasonable and regrettable."

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Enterprise Property Rights Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's First Enterprise
Property Rights Transfer Fair, the first of its kind in the
Chinese capital, attracted prospective buyers for some 56 small
industrial and service enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The total assets of related enterprises exceeded 600 million
yuan. Their assests vary from one million yuan to more than 10
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises involved came from the machine-building,
chemical, textile, electronics, food processing and commercial
sectors in the suburban counties of Daxing, Miyun, Changping and
Huairou.
</P>
<P>
Said enterprises faced severe financial problems with most of
their equipment and facilities remaining idle.
</P>
<P>
The fair was sponsored by the Beijing Economic Development
Investment Company (BEDIC) and the Beijing Property Rights
Transaction Service Center (BPRTS).
</P>
<P>
BEDIC President Wang Qi said that transactions will mainly
involve negotiated transfers. Auctions will be introduced in cases
where there are more than one bidder.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that none of the city's over 34,000 industrial
enterprises had previously been sold, a situation quite different
from the rapid development of property rights transfers in
southern cities.
</P>
<P>
China has established over 190 intermediary agencies dealing
with property rights transfers.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai witnessed some 300 property rights transfers in the
first half of this year, with the total transaction volume of 5.3
billion yuan representing a five-fold rise on the previous year's
period.
</P>
<P>
China is proceeding in line with the economic development
policy adopted by the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China and is urging small- to medium-sized enterprises to
seek development by reorganizing assets and introducing various
modes of ownership.
</P>
<P>
The policy stipulates that collectives, individuals and foreign
investors are permitted to purchase the assets and management
rights of state-owned enterprises.

BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will launch a campaign
in the coming months to clean up white pollution.
</P>
<P>
One step city officials plan to take is the installation of a
network of trash cans along main streets and in residential
districts.
</P>
<P>
In another step, non-recyclable shopping bags will be phased

<HEADLINE> Ramos Calls for Strict Compliance of Ceasefire Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos today called for strict compliance by both the government
and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) with the ground rules
of a general ceasefire forged between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Both sides should refrain from all acts that might set back
efforts to "establish permanent peace in Mindanao," the southern
Philippines, Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MILF signed a general ceasefire
agreement in July this year. To make it effective, they discussed
the basic rules to implement it in their ensuing negotiations and
inked a ground-rule agreement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ramos hailed the signing of the agreement, which eventually
paved the way for the holding of formal talks between the two
sides, as "a significant milestone in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The agreement bans both sides from committing hostile acts such
as kidnappings, attacks, bombings, robberies, raids, ambuscades,
summary executions and other criminal atrocities.
</P>
<P>
It also identified the specific ground rules covering the
movement of both government and MILF forces, conduct of inquiry by
an independent ceasefire watch group, disposition of violations of
the ceasefire and security of the government and MILF negotiators.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos congratulated both negotiating panels for
their efforts in coming out with the rules.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, their complementary efforts are clear manifestation
that we are one nation and one people who can work together toward
the attainment of a lasting peace and continuing economic
developing in Mindanao," he said.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a 12,000-member group operating in Mindanao. After
the mainstream Moro National Liberation Front signed a full peace
deal with the government in September 1996, it became the largest
rebel group in the country.

MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) Michel Camdessus said here today that the IMF
would oppose the creation of an independent Asian fund to bail out
troubled regional economies from the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference shortly after his arrival, he

Camdessus' remarks came ahead of a meeting to be held here on
November 18-19 by deputy finance ministers from the United States,
Japan and Asian economies to discuss the details of the
multi-billion dollar fund.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Asian fund should complement IMF programs and that
any spending it makes to help countries should be linked to the
IMF, he said, adding that if not, such a fund would be questioned
by regional markets.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is on a Southeast Asia tour which has brought him to
Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand to discuss the
financial situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the last leg of the tour, Camdessus is
expected to discuss with Philippine government officials the
country's economic situation and its proposed exit from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Saying that the country was less affected by the regional
currency turmoil due to sound economic fundamentals, he urged the
Philippine government to further strengthen its financial sector.

FUZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Rural residents in Fujian, a
coastal province in east China, purchased goods valued at 22.3
billion yuan during the first nine months of this year, up 16.8

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the U.N. commission
for monitoring the oil-for-food deal between the U.N. and Iraq
Benitton Stefan arrived here Friday on a week-long mission, a
U.N. source said today.
</P>
<P>
Stefan is scheduled to hold a series of meetings with Iraqi
leaders before heading for the northern provinces on a four-day
visit. He will leave Iraq on November 23.
</P>
<P>
The main aim of Stefan's visit is to get acquainted with the
humanitarian situation in Iraq, the source added.
</P>
<P>
This is Stefan's first visit to Iraq since he was appointed
head of the commission by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan in
October.
</P>
<P>
The current tension between Iraq and the United Nations over
the U.N. weapons inspectors did not affect the operation of the
oil-for-food program, according to the monitors of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Stefan's visit came when Iraq was facing possible U.S. military
strike due to its non-cooperation with the U.N. weapons
inspection teams and its expulsion of Americans working for the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
This showed the determination of the international
organization to go on with the implementation of the
oil-for-food deal and the supply of foodstuffs to the Iraqi
people who are suffering under the seven-year-old U.N. sanctions
imposed after Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal which was launched last December,
Iraq was allowed to export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil
over six months to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian
goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
The crippling economic sanctions cannot be lifted unless
U.N. arms inspectors verify that Iraq has eliminated all its
weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
SHANGHAI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Automobile

<HEADLINE> China Upsets Olympic Champions Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSAKA, Japan, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Asian Champion China
produced the biggest surprise Saturday at the men's competition of
the current world volleyball Grand Champions Cup, upseting Olympic
and European Champion the Netherlands 3-1 in a match played with
the newly introduced 25-minutes rule.
</P>
<P>
The highly spirited Chinese spikers clinched the contest over
their Dutch rivals 15-13, 15-10, 12-15 and 15-5.
</P>
<P>
Dutch head coach Toon Gerbrands claimed his team was the first
victim of the new 25-minute rule, which restricts the first four
sets of a match to be played under service-point scoring system
within 25-minutes.
</P>
<P>
If any of the first four sets goes more than 25-minutes, the
game will be changed to rally-point scoring system till a team
completes the necessary winning points of 15 or win the
tie-breaker by two points.
</P>
<P>
"First, I should say we played a very bad game today, but you
can see what happened with the time system, the weaker team can
win by luck." Gerbrands told a post-game press conference.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch side led 12-10 when the scoring board turned into
rally-points system and China tied it at 13-all with two smart
smashes and one lucky drop. Then blocker Zheng Liang sealed the
set for China by knocking down two powerfull smashes from Ducth
top spiker Bas Van De Goor in the last two plays.
</P>
<P>
"We led 12-10 in the first set, and suddenly the system
changed, the weaker team tied the scores by lucks. Otherwise we
would win the set." said Gerbrands.
</P>
<P>
"With the new system, we had no chance to rally. That's very
difficult. Our problems began after that (losing the first set)"
he added.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese Coach Wang Jiawei, who guided his boys for their
first Asian Championship title in 18-year last October, had
different opinions about the new time rule: "The team with less
mistakes could win matches with the new rule."
</P>
<P>
"We know they are the Olympic Champion and European
champion. To play against such a strong team, we had nothing to
lose. We want to learn in physical and mental aspects from them.
But in the first set, I found they didn't show their best forms.
So I am confident that even if the match were played in old
system, we still would have chance to beat them today, " he said.
</P>
<P>
In the second set, China led 13-10 into the rally-point
overtime. With fast breaking and solid blocking on the net, they
left no gap for their Dutch rivals to steal the game.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, hosts Japan beat Australia in straight
sets 3-0. The Japanese team controlled everything on the court
and never looked back before routing their younger Australian
counterparts 15-4, 15-10 and 15-3 with various weapons of
smashing, droping and blocks.
</P>
<P>
The Australian team, picked up by the International Volleyball
Association (FIVA) to replace African champion, would learn a lot
from its counterparts, which include continental champions of the
Netherlands, Cuba, Brazil and China. Japan took part in the event
as hosts.
</P>
<P>
"We has great disadvantage today. Our four key players arrived
in Japan last night and had no practice. This event is a
fantastic learning oppotunity for us." said Stelio De Rocco, the
head of Australia.
</P>
<P>
In Friday's last contest, Northern American Brazil rallied from
the first-set down to beat the Northern, Central American champion
Cuba 13-15, 15-10, 15-4 and 15-9.
</P>
<P>
The 12-day tournament started on Friday with the women's
competition, which include continental champions of Cuba, Brazil,
Russia and China, as well as FIVA selected team South Korea and
hosts Japan. The men's and women's events are played in alternate
days.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's First International-Aided Agricultural Project Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region's
first agricultural development project assisted by an
international organization has been completed after eight years.
</P>
<P>
The project, aided by the World Food Program of the United
Nations and covering more than 6,600 hectares of land in the Lhasa
River Valley, has greatly improved local agricultural and stock
raising conditions, according to the local agricultural department.
</P>
<P>
"It has settled the region's irrigation problem through the
construction of water conservation works," said a local
agricultural official, adding that more than 2,600 hectares of
farmland has been added to the irrigation area.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a net increase of some 700 tons of grain will be
added to the annual output of the area covered by the project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the project has helped the region raise the
husbandry output through grass cultivation and feed
improvement. The daily milk output per cow will increase by 1.13
kg, and the number of sheep grazing on every hectares of grassland
will exceed 45.
</P>
<P>
The project, launched in 1990 and with an overall investment of
nearly 100 million yuan (about 12.5 million US dollars), has
planted 2,000-plus hectares of trees, cultivated nearly 600
hectares of grass, added a length of 580 km to the region's
ditches, and provided training for 36,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Imposes Yellow Fever Vaccination Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Travelers from yellow
fever endemic countries will need a vaccination certificate
recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) to enter
Malaysia, its Health Minister Chua JUI Meng said today.
</P>
<P>
The entry condition imposed with immediate effect also applied
to Malaysian travelers who visited these countries, 33 in Africa
and 10 in South America, he told a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The countries on the African continent include Angola, Burkina
Faso, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Gambia, Kenya, Liberia, Senegal,
Somalia and Zambia while those in South America are Bolivia,
Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French-Guyana, Guyana, Panama, Peru,
Surinam and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
He said those without the vaccination certificate would undergo
quarantining process for a maximum of six days, which is the
incubation period of the disease, at entry points.
</P>
<P>
"This is to protect our citizens because our population is not
used to the infection of the virus," he said, adding that although
the country has yellow fever virus vector, the population is free
of the disease so far.
</P>
<P>
Yellow fever is an acute, infectious tropical disease caused by
a virus transmitted through the bite of yellow-fever mosquito.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the vaccination certificate is valid for 10
years and travelers to endemic countries must be vaccinated 10
days before departure. There are seven vaccination centers in the
country for Malaysian travelers.
</P>
<P>
He said the Foreign Ministry had also been directed by the
Cabinet to notify Malaysian embassies and high commissions
overseas in the affected countries on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
He said his government was serious over the ruling in view of
the expanding close ties in trade and investment as well as in
education between Malaysia and countries concerned due to its
active South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that if an epidemic were to occur in a
population like Malaysia, the death rate from the disease could be
up to 50 per cent for adults and up to 75 per cent for children.

<P>
PARIS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. President Bill Clinton Friday tried to convince
U.S. allies the need to force Iraq yield, while indicating that
Washington does not hesitate to act alone and resort to force by
announcing the dispatch of the aircraft carrier George Washington
to the Persian Gulf. In the meantime, the United States is
intensifying its negotiations with the members of the the U.N.
Security Council for hardening the stranglehold on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
-- According to the entourage of President Jacques Chirac, in the
case of an American military attack on Iraq, France will not oppose
the use of force while regretting the turning of the situation.
Chirac also expressed his regret over the ``obstinateness
of Iraqi leaders'' who he said had made ``an error'' by expelling
the United Nations arms inspection team. French presidential
officials estimated that the United States had ``fallen into a
trap'' prepared by Saddam Hussein who wanted to expel the United
Nations arms inspectors from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time, the United States President Bill Clinton
had indicated that as long as Saddam Hussein is in power, the United
Nations economic sanctions against Iraq should not be lifted. ``What
he had just done (expelling U.N. arms inspectors) is to ensure that
the sanctions will remain in place until the end of time,'' said
Clinton on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- President Jacques Chirac said at the 7th summit of
French-speaking countries in Hanoi on Friday that the Francophonie
movement is ``a resolutely political enterprise which is patient on
its way but ambitious in its vision.'' He recommended former United
Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali as the new spokesman
for the Francophonie movement, as ``one needs a man who is
universally known to affirm in the world the importance of the
Francophone political space.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Values Contribute to Global Century: Mahathir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said today Asians and their Asian values would
contribute to the Global Century because they believe in
prospering others in order to prosper themselves, the Malaysian
national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir described the 21st century as the "Global Century"
rather than the Asian Century.
</P>
<P>
However, it is the Asian values that would help the Global
Century become reality, "for we do not believe in destroying
others, undermining them deliberately, doing shady things in order
to ensure that they fail," he said today at a function in
Langkawi, a resort island, some 500 kilometers north from here.
</P>
<P>
"Nor do we gloat obscenely when we see others suffer as a
result of our actions," he added.
</P>
<P>
"These Asian values will not only overcome the present problem
but will actually help us to be magnanimous to those who try to
disable us. Thus will the Global Century be brought about," he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the present financial woes facing Southeast Asia, Mahathir
said the woes were due to greedy foreign traders who decided to
take everything for themselves and in the process, impoverishing
their host partners.
</P>
<P>
He said such traders neither practiced smart partnership nor
took a long-term view.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said such a partnership was exploitative and the host
country should avoid this type of investors.
</P>
<P>
"If allowed to invest, they should be restricted...the source
of their funds must be carefully examined," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Asia, Europe Urged to Take Measures to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Asian and European countries
are urged to take measures to promote their cooperation in tourism
as the industry plays an important role in their economic and
trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
First of all, visa processing procedures should be simplified,
said Asian and European representatives in a chairman's statement
released here on Friday after the second Asia-Europe business
forum (AEBF ii) closed.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, improvement should be made in the issuance of
multiple visas, extension of validity, and renewal of visa, said
the representatives from 10 Asian nations and 15 European nations
who attended the two-day event.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, consumer protection directives and guidelines in both
regions should be made transparent to reduce the impact of these
rules on travelers and increase tourism.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Asia and Europe should enhance their cooperation in
professional training and education in tourism to meet the
challenges of globalization as professionalism and quality
services will play a growing important role in the future.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the representatives also recommended that the
governments should simplify custom formalities and regulations for
international conferences and exhibitions and liberalize the
services to promote tourism.
</P>
<P>
Rules on imports of printed materials, brochures, and samples
used for international conferences and exhibitions should be eased
and exempted from import duties.
</P>
<P>
Refundable bank guarantee system should be established for
re-export of equipment used for exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
In connection with liberalization process, the representatives
said that tourism activities should be managed under freer
competition.
</P>
<P>
Existing restrictions such as the issuance of tour guide
licenses and work permits should be liberalized in both Asia and
Europe.

<HEADLINE> UNIP to release car for investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The UNIP Party said it will
release to the Human Rights Commission the vehicle which its
leader Kenneth Kaunda and Liberal Progressive Front (LPF) leader
Rodger Chongwe were in during the August 23 shooting accident.
</P>
<P>
Central committee member of the opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) Toyaonse Kabwe said here Friday his
party will cooperate with the local commission to facilitate
investigation into the alleged shooting of the two opposition
leaders by police if requested, according to Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
"We can release the vehicle to the Human Rights Commission and
not police because they can tamper with the evidence. We trust
the commission is composed of objective and impartial people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Kabwe said it is unfortunate that President Frederick Chiluba
has concluded that the two men were not shot.
</P>
<P>
Kabwe said the two leaders were sent to the General Hospital
in the central town of Kabwe for treatment and that a medical
report from the Hospital showed they suffered bullet wounds.
</P>
<P>
Yet Chiluba told new German ambassador to Zambia on Thursday
that the two leaders were dramatizing the alleged shooting in
order to discredit his government.
</P>
<P>
He said they had not been shot at although live ammunition was
fired in the air to disperse an illegal assembly.
</P>
<P>
After the Kabwe accident UNIP refused to hand over the car to
police for investigation and said it would only hand it to an
international investigation team.

<P>
COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- At least 55 people have been
taken in for questioning in Colombo following Friday's power plant
bombing by the Tamil rebels, police said here today.
</P>
<P>
A number of the detained have been released after being cleared
of any connection with the incident, which was blamed on the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), police said. Among those
questioned were 11 women.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tight security network is in force in Colombo and
its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Police also concluded after having done initial investigations
that the LTTE is lacking of "bomb experts." They said the rebels
who sneaked into the power plant apparently did a hurried job.
</P>
<P>
Six out of nine magnetic explosive devices they planted on four
oil tanks were duds, according to police. Early reports said there
were a total of ten explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
The biggest thermal power plant of Sri Lanka caught fire Friday
morning at around 5 o'clock due to the explosions of the devices.
Fire brigade and security personnel brought the fire under control
within about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
No one was killed or wounded in the incident and the plant
sustained minor damage.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Denies Arms Supply to UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official has
denied reports that the Zambian government has been supplying
arms by air to Angola's former rebel movement UNITA, Times of
Zambia reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted state house Cabinet Minister Eric Silwamba as
saying Friday that the Zambian government has never been involved
in the supply of arms to UNITA but that some private companies
have been violating Zambia's airspace to engage in the illegal
arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Reports of Zambian government's involvement are totally false
and the issue is now as good as resolved, Silwamba said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a meeting with visiting Angolan Home
Affairs Minister Santana Andre Pitra.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Star of South Africa, according to Times
of Zambia, quoted diplomatic sources in Luanda, Angola as warning
Zambia to cut off UNITA's supplies from its western region or
face the same sort of military intervention that toppled the
governments in the two Congos, which were both supplying UNITA
with weapons.
</P>
<P>
Silwamba noted that a South African company named Metex
International which is involved in the arms deal with UNITA has
been banned and its personnel deported from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Some senior Zambian personnel at Ndola Airport who were linked
to the deal has been sacked and the cabinet has signed a
statutory instrument empowering the Zambia Air Force to shoot any
plane using the country's airspace without permission, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
"We can only confirm that our airspace was violated at one
time and we took remedial measures. Our Angolan friends were
right to complain. But relations are now very good," said
Silwamba.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the Angolan minister said reports of
Angola's accusing Zambia of being involved in the arms deal with
UNITA are merely trying to strain relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he complained that some countries are still
supporting UNITA despite a United Nations arms sanctions.
However, he added, the issue is now being resolved by various
committees of the Southern African Development Community.

<HEADLINE> UN Worried Over UNITA Disbanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations observers
in Angola have expressed worries that the National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) has not approved them of
restarting the disbanding of UNITA militiamen based in Bailundo.
</P>
<P>
The Angola News Agency today quoted Nicholas Duse, head of
U.N. observers in central Angola as saying that the work should
have started on November 10, but no approval has been given by
UNITA leadership so far.
</P>
<P>
Registration of UNITA militiamen headquartered in Bailundo was
unilaterally halted by the former rebel movement on October 30
when the U.N Security Council announced sanctions on the
movement.
</P>
<P>
So far, according to Duse, the number of UNITA generals and
other senior officers and soldiers in Bailundo is not available
to the U.N. observers. Up to October 30, only 80 UNITA militiamen
had registered and handed over their weapons to the observers.
</P>
<P>
People should wait patiently for the change of UNITA, since
without peace, Angola would have no other way out, Duse noted.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the meeting between Angolan President Eduardo
dos Santos and UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi at the end of this
month will generate new stimulus to the peace process in Angola.

forum for coordination of efforts in this sphere," they said.
</P>
<P>
The representatives urged Asian and European governments to
establish investment regimes offering mutually beneficial
conditions, while taking account of their diverse economic
situations.
</P>
<P>

international bodies on investment protection principles, they
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Corp has resumed
production on its 747 jumbo jet assembly line, though efforts to
solve production problems are not complete.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's announcement today ended a 20-day shutdown during
which the production of 747-400's was halted and that of 737's was
slowed at a cost of 2.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown was ordered to eliminate problems caused by trying
to meet booming demand for airlines around the world.
</P>
<P>
Boeing, the world's largest aerospace manufacturer
headuqartered in Seattle, Washington State, received a record of
712 orders for new planes last year, up from 338 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The company now will resume turning out four 747s a month, and
is expected to increase its capacity to five a month by mid-1998,
said Brian Ames, spokesman for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Boeing said the shutdown would result in the

<HEADLINE> PNA Decides to Boycott Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has officially decided to boycott the Middle
East and North Africa economic conference due to open Sunday in
Qatar to protest Israel's derailment of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The decision to boycott the regional economic conference to be
held in Qatari capital Doha was made at a three-hour PNA Cabinet
meeting held in the West Bank city of Ramallah Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, Minister of Higher Education, told reporters
after the cabinet meeting that the PNA decided to boycott the
Doha conference in order to protest Israel's refusal to honor
the signed peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi condemned what she called "Israel's deliberate attempt
of derailing the peace process, refusing to implement the signed
agreements and continuing settlement activities."
</P>
<P>
The PNA's decision to boycott the Doha conference cast further
shadow over the annual economic gathering which was originally
initiated in 1994 to consolidate the peace process through
promoting Israeli-Arab economic cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the traditional list of boycotters which include
Syria, Lebanon, Iran and Iraq, this year leading Arab countries
such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Bahrain, and the United Arab
Emirates have also decided to shy away from the conference to
express their anger at the stalemate in the peace process caused
by Israeli hardline policies. But Jordan, Kuwait, Yemen, Tunisia
and Oman will attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy announced Thursday that he
would not attend the Doha conference and the Israeli delegation
will be headed by Industry and Trade Minister Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Levy's announcement was issued despite the fact that United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who herself is to
participate in the meeting, had been trying to press Israel to
send Levy.
</P>
<P>
The massive boycott of Doha conference highlights the
increasing isolation of Israel and unity of Arab countries at a
time when the Middle East peace process is virtually deadlocked
on all tracks because of Israel's hardline policies and its
refusal to implement the signed agreements.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed.
</P>
<P>
This week, the CPO physicals market was firm, supported by
buying interest for the Malaysian palm oil from private Pakistani
and Indian traders and by the talks that Indonesia may impose
quota for its crude palm oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Ivan Wong, a private crop forecaster, released his estimate on
Friday that Malaysia's October palm oil output at 922,000 tons,
less one percent from September's output.
</P>
<P>
Wong put end-October stocks at 1.005 million tons against the
Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority's figure at 877,704
tons for the end of September, 1997.
</P>
<P>
November South closed the week 65 ringgit (19.69 U.S. dollars)
higher to 1,710 ringgit (518.18 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals are expected to extend its uptrend next week
on the anticipated continuous strong buying interest, a dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
On the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), tin started on the
higher note this week at 18.19 ringgit (5.51 U.S. dollars) per kg
as the three-month tin on the London Metal Exchange (LME)
rebounded by 80 U.S. dollars per ton last Friday but the earlier
gains were eroded on Thursday after tin price on the LME dipped by
80 U.S. dollars per ton overnight.
</P>
<P>
However, strong buying interests on Friday ahead of the weekend
aided by the softening of the ringgit, pulled the tin price from
17.95 ringgit per kg back to 18 ringgit level.
</P>
<P>
Tin closed the week at 18.01 ringgit (5.45 U.S. dollars) per
kg, up 19 sen from last week's close at 17.82 ringgit (5.4 U.S.
dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover this week totaled 358 tons against 415
tons last week.
</P>
<P>
On the Malaysian rubber market, December RSS One closed the
week 10 sen lower to 277.00 sen (83.93 U.S. cents) per kg while
SMR 20 slipped by 8.5 sen to 277.50 sen (84 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The International Natural Rubber Organization (INRO) daily
market indicator for November 13 was at 202.40 Malaysia/Singapore
cents per kg against 207.31 cents on November 6.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 204.86 cents per kg this
week against 208.12 cents per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber market is expected to experience slow and
quiet trading next week as most players are likely to take to the
sidelines in the absence of fresh leads amid poor market sentiment
which is not only prevailing in Malaysia but also in the region
following the economic instability in Thailand as well as the
regional currencies, a dealer said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Issues Water Shortage Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Interior and Local
Government Secretary Robert Barbers today called on all local
officials to immediately implement contingency measures to cushion
the effects of El Nino, specially the shortage of water.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of President Fidel Ramos' call to respond to El
Nino, Barbers said that local government units should lead in the
drive to conserve water and take necessary steps to protect the
country's water resources.
</P>
<P>
"We must immediately put into action practical water
conservation measures which will reduce our water consumption and
allows us to recycle water," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barbers said local government units can enact ordinances
banning the drawing of water from communal waterworks system for
watering lawns, gardens, campuses, parks and for pressurized car
washes.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local government units to monitor the use of all
public deep wells, fountains, and springs to ensure that the water
from these sources are properly utilized, preferably only for
cooking and for other basic human needs.
</P>
<P>
Industrial users should have their own water sources so as not
to prejudice the water available to the general public or unduly
deplete communal water systems such as rivers and lakes, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Barbers ordered all regional offices under his
department to undertake an information campaign to disseminate
water conservation measures and to explain the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that water shortage brought by the El Nino
weather phenomenon will be very serious in the Philippines. The
Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System in Metro Manila has
announced that it will reduce water supply and the number of hours
of water service.
</P>
<P>
"The lowered levels in our dams and water catchments will
worsen even more unless the weather cycle brings us typhoons,"
Barbers said, adding it is necessary to "do everything possible to
alleviate the adverse effects of the El Nino".

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) ended the week sharply lower on lack of buying
support amid concerns of high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The 100-quality stocks Composite Index fell 29.98 points to
677.47, the all-share Emas Index dropped 9.99 points to 189.67,
the Second Board Index lost 19.45 points to 328.17 while the

</P>
<P>
The benchmark touched an intra-week high of 700.96 on Monday
and a low of 671.86 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The market started the week broadly easier in reaction to
heavyweight utility, Tenaga Nasional's much lower profit of 144.7
million ringgit (43.85 million U.S. dollars) following a loss of
1.3 billion ringgit (393.94 million U.S. dollars) in foreign

<P>
On the local front, players remained jittery over the banking
sector despite assurance by International Monetary Fund managing
director Michel Camdessus that Malaysia's banking sector did not
face serious problems.

<P>
They were bearish over the regional outlook and worried over
the possibility of rising rates after banks raised their base
lending rates to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE showed an initial reaction to rally on Wall Street
which rallied on Alan Greenspan's testimony to the Congress that
the impact of the currency turmoil in Asia on the U.S. economy was
modest before rises were capped by concerns.
</P>
<P>
On the KLSE, the mainboard volume totaled 760.462 million
shares worth 2.574 billion ringgit (780 million U.S. dollars) from
1.250 billion shares valued at 4.993 billion ringgit (1.51 billion

<HEADLINE> Minister Discloses Gender Imbalances in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Gender
and Community Development Janat Mukwaya said here that
decision-making is still predominantly a male domain in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
She was quoted by local paper The New Vision as saying Friday
that at ministerial level, six out of 54 ministers are women,
which was a percentage of 11.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Gender imbalances are equally evident in the civil service,
health and education sectors, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"In the civil service, women make up only 19.4 percent of the
total permanent secretaries, while out of 45 chief administrative
officers, five are women," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, although women constitute 70 to 80 percent of the
agricultural labor force, only 7 percent own land and 30 percent
have access to land and control over proceeds.
</P>
<P>
"Women's productivity is further hampered by inadequate access
to credit and general lack of skills and appropriate flow of and
access to information," Mukwaya added.
</P>
<P>
In the education sector, she said, gender imbalances are
evident in the literacy rate and access to education.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the 1991 population and housing census, Mukwaya said
61.3 percent of females are illiterate compared to 38.7 percent
males.
</P>
<P>
She disclosed gender imbalances while launching a national
gender policy as a legal framework which will guide policy makers
and all actors in development to redress existing gender
imbalances.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: LTTE Bombs Colombo to Divert Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Tiger of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) rebels once again proved they are Sri Lanka's biggest
obstacle on the hard road to peace when they planted bombs in a
power station in Colombo Friday morning, causing minor damages to
four oil tanks.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the second in one month by the LTTE following
the fatal bombing attack in the downtown business area of Colombo
on October 15, which killed 18 people and injured 100 more others.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts here said the two incidents showed that military
victory of the government troops in the north has forced the
rebels to resort to a new round of terrorist bombing attacks in
the capital to shake off their military pressure on battle fields.
</P>
<P>
Since the Operation Jayasikuru (Certain Victory) was launched
on May 13 to obtain a 70-kilometer-long transport line running to
the north, the troops have killed over 2,500 rebels.
</P>
<P>
The road is of vital strategic importance to the government,
which has to rely heavily on costly marine and airborne
transportation owing to constant rebel assaults on land route to
Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
The troops so far have cleared about two thirds of the road as
the operation entered its final phase. In desperation, the Tigers
slipped into Colombo seeking every chance to create chaos, the
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said the rebel leader, Velupillai
Prabhakaran, had fled Sri Lanka for another country weeks ago. If
the reports were true, they could be further indicators that the
LTTE is facing an unfavorable situation in the north as a result
of offensives by the Army.
</P>
<P>
Foreign diplomatic sources here said due to the military
assaults in the north, several LTTE guerrilla troops had been
dispersed into small units after they lost contact with their
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Some of the units moved southwards and infiltrated into the
capital.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said the bomb blast in Colombo last month was
carried out by one of such units. Those rebels had brought a total
of six truck-bombs into the city, according to the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Tigers defied tight security in Colombo and
attempted to give a bitter bite to the government when they
sneaked into Sri Lanka's biggest thermal power plant in pre-dawn
darkness and planted ten magnetic explosive devices on four oil
tanks.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the swift action of the security forces a fire
following the explosions of the devices was put off within 30
minutes, averting a major disaster.
</P>
<P>
A prominent feature of the two attacks was that the rebels
chose the traditional Full Moon Day to carry out their actions.
Both October 15 and November 14 were Full Moon Days when people do
not need to go to office.

<HEADLINE> Census on Non-Beijing Permanent Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- "I am a population surveyer in
this area and entrusted by the government, I have come to your
home to register non-Beijing permanent residents. I need your
help, and please answer a few questions."
</P>
<P>
Old lady Lu Xiulan, who works at the Dahongmen Neighborhood
Committee, feels uneasy when she introduces herself this way to
her "neighbors", a group of young non-Beijing residents. These
young people used to call her "aunt".
</P>
<P>
However, such introduction must be strictly used for surveyers
to carry out the first census on the migrant population in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xiulan and many other surveyers all underwent a week special
training before they started registration routines.
</P>
<P>
The total number of surveyers stands at over 60,000, consisting
of staffers of government departments, workers, farmers, students,
soldiers and retired elders.
</P>
<P>
Surveyers were trained to introduce the aim and significance of
the census, and they must be polite to those surveyed. Surveyers
must use standard language and can not ask misleading questions.
</P>
<P>
Lu Xiulan said, "I feel like a lawyer in a foreign film, not to
ask questions to mis-guide the surveyed."
</P>
<P>
Each surveyer carries a form specially-designed on the basis of
demography and statistics.
</P>
<P>
Based on experiences of past censuses, the Beijing Municipal
Statistics Bureau also works out a computer program for the
current census on non-Beijing residents, for future use in guiding
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
The current census on the migrant population in Beijing started
on November 1 and will end today.

</P>
<P>
Experts said it will cost around 750 million U.S. dollars to
repair the concrete shell.
</P>
<P>
To date, the Group of Seven industrial powers - Britain,
Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States - have
approved a 300 million dollars grant to help the project and the

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Sign Planned Peace Treaty with Tribal Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
scheduled to hold the next and probably final round of talks with
the tribal rebels on Sunday, in a bid to finalize the
controversial peace agreement for the trouble-torn Chittagong Hill
Tracts (CHT).
</P>
<P>
After six rounds of secret talks since the Awami (people's)
League took power last June, the government has finally reached a
draft agreement with the Parbattya Chattagram Jana Sanghati
Samity, the political wing of the armed rebels.
</P>
<P>
Official sources could not confirm any date of signing of the
agreement but there is speculation that it may be signed any day
between November 16 and 21 if there are no fresh complications.
</P>
<P>
"Some minor issues were yet to be resolved but those could be
solved easily," said an official of the prime minister's office,
adding that the two sides have been centering on the control of
the local police, the local administration and its power over
land.
</P>
<P>
Other sources indicated that the agreement might be signed
after the three-nation Business Summit scheduled for November 23
with the participation of prime ministers from India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bangladeshi tribal refugees, crammed in six camps in
the Indian state of Tripura, will resume returning home on
November 21.
</P>
<P>
The planned peace agreement on the CHT has already come under
strong criticism by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP), and its allies, including Jamaat-e-Islami, who say
the accord would jeopardize national sovereignty and territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
The BNP-led combined opposition of the CHT has called for a
dawn-to-dusk countrywide general strike on the day when the
agreement is signed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Continue Allowing Ukrainian Steel in Duty Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The United States recently
decided to postpone investigation into Ukraine's alleged dumping
of steel and allow Ukrainian steel to enter the U.S. market duty
free until 2002, media here reported today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S, Department of Commerce imposed preliminary duties on
Ukrainian steel this summer after U.S. mills accused Ukrainian
steel makers of selling their products at dumping prices.
</P>
<P>
However, under the terms of a five-year agreement signed
recently, the U.S. has given Ukraine an annual duty-free quota of
158,000 tons of steel, a far cry from the 350,000 tons Ukraine
wanted.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government started levying duties of 100 percent and
177 percent respectively on Ukrainian mills after U.S. companies
complained last November.
</P>
<P>
With the duties imposed, the Ukrainian steel industry lost up
to 70 million U.S. dollars this year. Ukraine exported 572,000
tons of steel with an average price of 361 dollars per ton to the
U.S. in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Asia, Europe Push Ahead Trade Facilitation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Second Asia-Europe
Business Forum (AEBF II) Friday urged the private sectors in Asia
and Europe to speed up their input into government initiatives
such as the Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAP).
</P>
<P>
The plan should be finalized early in order to allow the
governments of Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) countries to adopt it at
their meeting in London on April 3-4 next year, the forum said in
a chairman's statement released at the end of its two-day meeting
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The forum agreed that the priority areas suggested in the
framework for TFAP endorsed by economic ministers at their meeting
in September 1997 in Japan are generally commendable," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
The forum called on governments to enhance their work in the
areas of government procurement, quarantine inspection, and
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
Governments should ensure transparency, simplification,
availability and consistency of trade information, particularly
with regard to regulations, standards and other procedures related
to trade in goods and services with the objective of achieving
unified testing standards and acceptance of suppliers declarations
on conformity, the forum said.
</P>
<P>
It proposed the setting up of a data base on trade standards
and procedures of ASEM countries for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
The forum also pointed out that deregulation should be
encouraged in order to increase trade opportunities and joint
ventures in the field of goods and services between Asian and
European companies.
</P>
<P>
"Rules and regulations governing trade and trade related
activities for foreign firms should be made readily available,
applied effectively, consistently and in a non-discriminatory
manner," the forum said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
Also, the forum urged governments to proceed with early and
full implementation of the commitments undertaken in the Uruguay
Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The priority should be given to tariff quotas and licenses,
simplification of customs procedures, transparency of relevant
laws and regulations, trading rights and distribution in local
markets, intellectual property rights, and standards testing and
certification, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Strengthening two-way trade flows in goods and services
between Asia and Europe is a major objective of the Asia-Europe
Business Forum," it said.
</P>
<P>
Describing its role in this respect, the forum said that it
will provide private sector input into government initiatives,
identify obstacles to trade activities and the solutions, find
opportunities for closer private sector cooperation, and support
efforts to strengthen the multilateral system embodied in the
World Trade Organization.

metropolitan area with about 1.5 million slum-dwellers, the
independent United News of Bangladesh (UNB) reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Zillur Rahman, minister of local government, rural development
and cooperatives, quoted the statistics from the latest survey
made by the Urban Poverty Reduction Project while replying to a
slum-related question raised in the Parliament Thursday, UNB said.
</P>
<P>
The present government has no plan to rehabilitate the
slum-dwellers, the minister stated, adding that such a program can
be taken if the country gets necessary foreign assistance for the
purpose.
</P>
<P>
The minister told the Parliament that 130 slum families were
rehabilitated in City Palli in 1990 in order to ensure a
pollution-free environment in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Dhaka City Corporation has been conducting a
project to improve the living standard of 31,000 people in 18
slums since 1991 with financial assistance from UNICEF and
technical assistance from the Local Government Engineering
Department, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The project includes drinking water supply, primary healthcare,
primary education and credit for self-employment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka, capital of Bangladesh, has a population of nine million.

<HEADLINE> Major Infectious Diseases Decline in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of major
infectious disceases has been declining in China in the past seven
years, an official with the Ministry of Public Health said.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted Wang Zhao, department director in
charge of disease control with the Ministry of Public Health, as
saying that China has detected no polio cases caused by "wild
polio virus" since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a four-day national meeting on
communicable-diseases control and prevention, she said the country
registered 922 cholera cases, a drop of 81 percent from the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of new-borns in cities are now vaccinated
against hepatitis B, the average rate for rural areas is 42.5
percent, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The hepatitis B antigen positive rate among children below 10
years old has dropped from around 10 percent in the early 1990s to
the current 1.19 percent.
</P>
<P>
She said, thanks to a sound anti-epidemic network, no serious
epidemics were reported after natural disasters such as flooding,
earthquake and drought.
</P>
<P>
All newly emerging and re-appearing communicable illnesses,
such as HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, are under strict surveillance.
</P>
<P>
However, the official emphasised that this is no time for the
nation to rest on its laurels, adding more efforts will be needed
in the future to maintain this achievement and tackle new problems
brought by the newly appearing and re-emerging illnesses.

<HEADLINE> Major Gas Field in Northwest China Under Full Exploration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Changqing Gas Field in
northwest China has entered full-scale exploration since the first
high-yield gas well was sunk in the field on June 22, 1989.
</P>
<P>
The field is situated in the Erdos Basin which sits on the
juncture of Shaanxi, Gansu, Shanxi provinces, and Ningxia Hui,
Inner Mongolia autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Over the past eight years, the Changqing Petroleum Prospecting
Administration, which is in charge of oil and gas prospecting and
development in the gas field, has spent over three billion yuan on
gas prospecting and has sunk 220 testing wells.
</P>
<P>
The gas field is proven to have gas reserves of 289.6 billion
cu m, and has a gas-bearing area totalling over 4,960 sq km.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the Changqing Petroleum Prospecting Administration
has invested 1.2 billion yuan in building 14 gas accumulation
stations, sinking 39 gas treatment wells, laying 450 km of
pipelines and building China's largest gas purification station,
with a gas accumulation capacity of three billion cu m.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, now with an annual capacity of 840 million cu m
of gas, started to supply gas to Xi'an, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, last June, and to Beijing last
September. By the end of October, it had produced 1.9 billion cu m
of gas.
</P>
<P>
Shi Xingquan, Director of the Changqing Petroleum Prospecting
Administration, pledged that his administration would work harder
to bring the volume of proven gas reserves from the present 289.6
billion cu m to 1,000 billion cu m by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
He is confident of realizing the goal as the Erdos Basin,
China's second largest after Tarim Basin, also in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has 4,170 billion cu m
of gas resources which account for over 10 percent of China's
total.
</P>
<P>
The gas field will form a production capacity of 5.5 billion cu
m of gas by the turn of this century and will further increase the
capacity to 10 billion cu m by the year of 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to him, two more pipelines, Shaanxi
(Qingbian)-Ningxia (Yinchuan) and Shaanxi(Qingbian)-Gansu
(Lanzhou) pipelines, will soon begin construction. It is expected
that the two pipelines will be finished and put into service in
1998 and 1999, respectively.

ROME, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini today offered up his recipe for sharpening the country's
competitive edge on the global market.
</P>

"In a world of ever more liberalized trade, new results must be
reached within a framework that ensures full implementation of the
rules governing competition," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the World Trade Organization (WTO), which
has created an intergovernmental work group to give in-depth
attention to this issue, should play a fundamental role.
</P>

The meeting is co-organized by the European University
Institute and the Italian Foreign Trade Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Russia Agrees to Drop Import Tax on Ukrainian Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian coffers will see a
sweeter year in 1998 as Moscow agreed Friday to drop a 25 percent
import tax on Ukrainian sugar.
</P>
<P>
However, under the deal reached here, Moscow will impose an
annual quota of 60,000 tons on imports of Ukrainian sugar.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed on a list of Russian commodities that
would enter the Ukrainian market duty-free.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is the largest sugar producer among the former Soviet
republics. Its sugar, used to sweeten the whole Soviet Union, was
forced out of the Russian market when Moscow announced a
25-percent import tax last May, a heavy blow to its fragile
economy.
</P>
<P>
Kiev, in retaliation, decided to levy value-added taxes on
Russian exports to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
As a result, trade volume between the neighbors plummeted in
the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Observers say export of 60,000 tons of sugar will not help Kiev
much because Ukraine used to sell Moscow more than one million
tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Trade is expected to remain a main topic during Ukrainian
President Leonid Kuchma's visit to Russia from November 16 to 17.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Mexico Pledge More Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and visiting Mexican President Ernest Zedillo signed here today a
joint declaration for more cooperation between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We met to carry forward the mature partnership between our two
governments, marked by mutual respect...to continue our personal
contacts in order to spur further cooperation on issues of vital
importance to our citizens," the two leaders said in the joint
declaration.
</P>
<P>
The joint declaration, signed after a meeting between the two
presidents at the White House, said that they agreed to cooperate
in talks on climate change, border and drug control, macroeconomic
issues, trade and environment.
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade between the U.S. and Mexico has doubled since the
North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect in 1994 and
will total 165 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, which has been the second largest export market for
U.S. goods ahead of Japan, was one of the countries that is
considered by the U.S. as vitally important to its long-term
prosperity and security.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that two neighbors and partners, like the
U.S. and Mexico, can address even the most complex issues through
mutual respect, constructive dialogue and cooperation," the two
leaders announced.
</P>
<P>
The increased trade between the two countries and across the
2800 kilometer border have brought many problems.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents expressed concern about food safety and
agreed to establish a way to ensure food products traded between
their countries were safe.
</P>
<P>
"We also agreed on the need to further bolster efforts to
reduce the demand for illicit drugs, as part of a comprehensive
approach to anti-narcotics cooperation," they said.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the two countries need "effective action
against drug corruption on both sides of the border."
</P>
<P>
On climate change, they said they agreed that developed
countries like the U.S. must lead by reducing emissions of
green-house gases and Mexico, like other developing countries,
"should be willing to participate in an approach global regime."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the two presidents also attended a signing
ceremony of a convention on stemming the illicit firearms signed
by 29 members of the Organization of American States (OAS).

successfully used silt in the West Lake of Hangzhou City in east
China's Zhejiang Province to produce organic composite fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
Large-scale experiment indicated that the yield of rice
cultivated with the application of silt-turned fertilizer shot up
at least 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Silt in the lake is 0.6 meters thick while water depth averages
only 1.59 meters.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1996, the Zhejiang Yinshida Corporation began to
develop West Lake silt.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Heng, General Manager of the company, said, with support
from the State Science and Technology Commission, a pilot plant
has been built and it can process 50,000 cubic meters of lake silt
and produce 60,000 tons of organic composite fertilizer annually
starting from next year.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian First Deputy Foreign
Minister Igor Ivandor reiterated here today that Russia is against
the use of force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Interfax news agency, Ivandor said a
constructive way should be found in implementing the U.N. Security
Council resolutions on Iraq's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Any military action against Iraq must be taken with prior
approval from the Security Council, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivandor called on Iraq to facilitate the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors, but said what Iraq has done in fulfilling Security
Council resolutions and destroying the banned weapons should be
looked at objectively.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Russia's State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, approved a resolution that calls for measures other
than force in settling the current crisis.

<P>
CARACAS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan National
Anti-drug Commission (CNA) is launching a national offensive
against the consumption of crack.
</P>
<P>
"We are developing a national offensive to show people the
damage caused by crack," Carlos Tablante, Minister of State and
CNA president, was quoted as saying by the local media today.
</P>
<P>
Crack consumption has reportedly increased gradually in
Venezuela. Official data shows that in 1995 only 77 grams of the
drug were seized.

But last year more than six kilograms of the drug were
confiscated and up to the first week of this month 19.5 kilograms
were seized.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A terrestrial animal
investigation group of south China's Hainan Province has
discovered 107 kinds of wild animals in the Wuzhi Mountain Nature
Reserve in the central part of the island province.
</P>
<P>
Rare animals including black bears, clouded leopards, sambars
and silver pheasants are listed among the 107 kinds of animals.
</P>
<P>
The provincial investigation group went through the nature
reserve from east to west between October 5 and 7 to conduct
investigation.
</P>
<P>
The investigation group believed that large animals like black
bears and clouded leopards scatter all over the nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the discovery indicated that a complete ecological
system including a complicated food-chain exists in the Hainan
Wuzhi Mountain which guarantees balance between various kinds of
animals.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that protection efforts should focus on black
bears, clouded leopards and other kinds of animals and their
ecological environment.

<HEADLINE> Police Say 3 Tamil Rebels Had Entered Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Three rebels of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had sneaked into a power plant and
planted bombs onto four oil tanks, causing explosion and fire to
the plant in Colombo, police said here today.
</P>
<P>
Police said initial investigations have revealed that the
terrorists had entered the security zone of the power station from
its railway line side by cutting barbed wire entanglements early
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Tigers fixed a total of ten magnetic explosive devices onto
four diesel tanks after they entered the plant, police said.
</P>
<P>
Security personnel also found two leaflets in Tamil giving
instructions as to how to use the explosive devices.
</P>
<P>
Fire broke out following the explosion of the devices at around
5 o'clock local time Friday at the biggest thermal power plant in
Sri Lanka, which was built in 1963 and expanded thereafter.
</P>
<P>
The fire was brought under control within 30 minutes and the
tanks sustained minor damages, according to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
Friday's power plant fire was the latest attempt by the LTTE to
create chaos in the capital city Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a truck bomb exploded in the business center of
Colombo, shocking economic nerves of the country as 18 people were
killed, 100 more others wounded and many landmarks damaged.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- China will launch an improved
model of Long March-2-III rocket loading with two iridium
satellites owned by US-based Motorola Inc during the first week of
December, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It will be the 11th launch this year by the China Academy of
Launch Vehicle Technology, said Li Jianzhong, director of the
academy, China's rocket researcher and developer.
</P>
<P>
The ten previous successful launches of satellites and other
objects marked this memorable year, which has seen the highest
success rate of 100 percent, Li said at a press conference
yesterday celebrating the academy's 40th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the academy is considering listing itself on the
stock market as part of the efforts to promote the development of
launch vehicles.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, it is trying to shorten the research
and developing periods of launch vehicles as it works to develop a
mature rocket-production industry.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Li added, his academy is strengthening
quality control to ensure and enhance the stability of its rocket.
</P>
<P>
In the past 40 years the academy has developed a series of Long
March launch vehicles that can meet the requirements of most
launches and has occupied a share of the world market of launch
services.

was a "prudent measure" for any contingency, which might occur
amid rising tension with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I have ordered today the aircraft carrier George Washington to
the region as a prudent measure to help assure that we have the
forces we need for any contingency," the president told reporters

ATHENS -- Washington should pressure Ankara into cooperating
towards resolving the protracted Cyprus problem, said Greek
Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after briefing Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos on recent foreign policy developments, Pangalos

WASHINGTON -- Richard Butler, chief weapons inspector of the
United Nations, said Friday he believed U.N. inspectors, now
pulled out of Iraq, would be back to discharge their duties again.
</P>
<P>
"I refuse to believe that the international community is simply
going to walk away from the very large problem that is presented
by Iraq's weapons of mass destruction," he said in an interview
with CNN. "We'll have to be back, in one way or another, and as
soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Six American inspectors of the U.N. weapons inspection teams
left Iraq late Thursday following Baghdad's order of their
expulsion. And the other 68 U.N. team members also flew out of
Iraq Friday to Bahrein under the order of Butler in protest to
Iraq's expulsion of the Americans.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A replica of an ancient
seismograph invented by Chinese scientist Zhang Heng is on display
in the Guangdong Provicial Museum in Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Technicians from Henan province produced a duplicate of the
2.96-meter high, 2.68-meter in diameter device that is shaped like
a wine vessel.
</P>
<P>
According to the State Seismology Bureau, it is similar in
appearance, structure, and function to a description provided by
historical documents.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Heng made the original in A.D. 132, and his device
monitored an earthquake 854 kilometers away in A.D. 138.
</P>
<P>
But, the scientist only worked on a simple description of his
invention in 196 characters. So, for hundreds of years, inventors
in many countries have tried to duplicate the seismograph, but its
complex internal structure defeated them.
</P>
<P>
After the exhibition here, a Guangzhou auction house will
auction the machine off in December.

<HEADLINE> Shanxi Benefits From Controlling Soil Erosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The ten-year construction
project on the Fenhe River, located in north China's Shanxi
province, has not only effectively controlled erosion, but has
also helped local farmers escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the Fenhe River Basin, especially areas in the
upper reaches of the river, long suffered from the effects of
severe soil erosion which not only led to poverty, but also
threatened the integrity of the Fenhe Reservoir and agricultural
and industrial production of the area.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the provincial government has invested 200 million
yuan (12.5 million U.S. dollars) in efforts to control soil
erosion in the upper reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
Soil erosion on some 150,000 ha in the upper reaches of the
river has primarily been controlled over the past decade. New
vegetation planted on 112,000 ha has effectively improved the
local ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
Some 31,000 ha of farmland in the upper reaches have been
reclaimed, and the per capita income of local farmers has jumped
to 1,000 yuan (125 US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Americans Abroad Warned of Retaliation on CIA Shooter Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
today warned American citizens abroad that they could be targets
for retaliation after a U.S. jury recommended to sentence to death
a Pakistani for killing two CIA officers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It was the second such warning since Mir Aimal Kasi was
convicted of murder Monday by the same jury in Fairfax, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"The Department advises Americans traveling abroad that the
potential exists for retaliation by Kasi's sympathizers against
American interests," the State Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"While we have no specific threat information, American
citizens traveling abroad should pay close attention to their
personal security practices overseas in light of the potential
threat," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
After Kasi's conviction, four Americans were shot dead in
Karachi, Pakistan. Pakistani officials and some U.S. lawmakers
said the killings were apparently retaliation for the conviction
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kasi, 33, was convicted of shooting dead two CIA officers and
wounding three others outside the main gate of the Central
Intelligence Agency in Langley, Virginia, on January 25, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Kasi returned to his native Pakistan after the shooting.
Following four and a half years of manhunt, the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) tracked him to a Pakistani hotel and
arrested him in June, then brought him to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member Fairfax County jury made the death penalty
recommendation today. But the judge is expected to pronounce the
final sentence on January 23.

<HEADLINE> Automation Technology Targets Growing Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Automation technology and
equipment, key elements in the nation's campaign to renovate large
and medium-sized state enterprises, will find a large and
enthusiastic market in China, experts said in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The further development of automation technology will have
extensive prospects owing to China's sustained economic growth,"
said Zhang Yijun, vice-director of the Manufacturing Technology
Committee under the China Automation Association (CAA).
</P>
<P>
The country's loss-making state enterprises will carry out
large-scale technological renovation, as a result of the central
authority's determination to intensify reforms by means of merger
and the joint stock system.
</P>
<P>
"The automation technology will play a key role in this
campaign," an industrial expert said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that China need 100 units of large
distribution control systems (DCS) and 500 small DCS units
annually.
</P>
<P>
The country also sees high demand for programmable logic
controllers (PLC). More than 200 units of large PLC are ordered
annually, along with 2,000 units of medium-sized equipment and
20,000 units of small equipment.
</P>
<P>
"The demand for automation technology and equipment is very
strong, but the product quality should be given great attention,"
said Zhou Donghua, CAA vice-secretary general.
</P>
<P>
In an effort to improve the technology for industrial
automation and quality inspection, the China International
Automation and Quality Control Machinery and Equipment Exhibition
will be held in Beijing next year.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Cataract Sufferers Getting International Assistance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A four-year-old internationally
project has helped more than 6,000 farmers, herdsmen, urbanites,
workers and officials suffering from cataracts in the Tibet
Autonomous Region recover their eyesight.
</P>
<P>
The oldest of the patients is 106, and youngest, three months
old.
</P>
<P>
Government departments have put 36 million yuan (4.5 million US
dollars) into the program, and according to the Aid Tibet
Development Fundation (ATDF) in the capital city, Lhasa, in the
third quarter of this year, 2,500 cataract patients underwent free
eye surgery.
</P>
<P>
The region has the highest incidence of cataract disease in
China, because of its high altitude, long periods of sunshine,
strong ultraviolet rays, and brightness from the snow in winter.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, ATDF has invited people from foreign
non-governmental charitable organizations to operate free of
charge on local cataract sufferers. The project has gotten help
from the US SEVA Foundation, the Nepal Eye Program, the Foundation
Eye-Care Himalaya of the Netherlands, and Germany's Christofle
Blindness Mission.
</P>
<P>
ATDF and SEVA have signed an agreement to set up an eye
treatment center in Lhasa. The center will also be responsible for
training medical workers.
</P>
<P>
ATDF, Lhasa's first non-governmental charitable organization,
was established ten years ago. Its aim is to make better use of
foreign assistance to speed up the economic and social development
of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
ATDF has raised over 100 million yuan (12.5 million US dollars)
and launched more than 360 assistance projects.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief Comes to Review Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Managing Director Michel
Camdessus of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is arriving
here today from Bangkok to review the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is on the last leg of his Southeast Asia tour to
check on the region's currency turmoil. He has been to Jakarta,
Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus is expected to discuss with President Fidel Ramos and
government officials the status of the Philippine economy and the
exit of the country from the IMF program.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the IMF has asked the Philippines to "be more
realistic" and reduce its 1998 economic growth target to a range
of four to five percent from the projected 6.5 to 7.5 percent,
saying a higher growth target may result in bigger budget deficit
and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Manila last month slashed its 1997 growth target by two
percentage points to between 5.5 and 6 percent as a result of the
currency crisis sweeping the region.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is hoping to put its economic house
in order to be able to graduate from 35 years of IMF tutelage by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the scheduled exit was put in doubt after the
country's Supreme Court declared the oil deregulation law
"unconstitutional" a couple of days ago. The law was one of the
three parts of a program which the Philippines must complete
before quitting the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said the currency situation
in the country is stabilizing even when the country maintains its
plan of exiting from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"We have not needed an IMF assistance package. In fact, we are
due to exit from the IMF while others are entering," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the trip to Manila, Camdessus will also discuss the
setting up of an Asia fund to help battle the currency crisis.
President Ramos said the country has been all set to push for the
fund despite the IMF's opposition.

<HEADLINE> House Committee Begins Investigating Influential Congressman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The ethics committee of the
U.S. House of Representatives Friday began investigating
Pennsylvania Representative Bud Shuster, an influential Republican
whose Transportation Committee authorizes highway and mass transit
programs affecting every state.
</P>
<P>
The move was based on a complaint challenging the propriety of
Shuster's personal and professional ties with Ann Eppard, a
transportation lobbyist who was his congressional chief of staff
for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Under his leadership, Congress this week completed action on a
9.7 billion-dollar bill that will keep state highway programs
operating for another six months.
</P>
<P>
"I'm pleased that the committee is moving expeditiously. This
is the proper procedure," Shuster said.
</P>
<P>
Ann Eppard Associates, specializing in issues before Shuster's
committee, took in 1.1 million dollars from 17 clients in 1996,
House records show. Her firm had 23 active clients this year and
took in 740,000 dollars in the first six months.
</P>
<P>
Eleven clients signed up in 1997, citing the new highway bill
as a subject matter for her lobbying.
</P>
<P>
Shuster last year called the complaint by the private
Congressional Accountability Project a "smear campaign" and "a
transparent attempt to influence" his 1996 re-election campaign.
The watchdog organization was founded by congressional critic
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
Eppard also serves as assistant treasurer for his campaign and
has provided transportation for him. She receives a monthly
consulting fee for her campaign work and has helped him raise 1.7
million dollars since 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ethics complaint grew out of Shuster's disclosure that he
and his family have used Eppard's residence for overnight lodging
many times. Critics say the practice violates a ban on gifts.
Shuster and Eppard say the arrangement is legal because of their
longtime friendship.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have looked into allegations that Shuster and
Eppard used campaign funds for personal use and that business
deals were made with Eppard's son, Ralph, to win Shuster's help in
settling the property disputes, according to reports.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Army Official Resigns over Marine Remarks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Army
Secretary Sara Lister resigned today over her recent public
comments that Marines were "extremists" and "dangerous," the
Pentagon announced.
</P>
<P>
"Her resignation was submitted, accepted, and I think the
matter is over," Defense Secretary William Cohen told reporters at
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Lister had apologized to the Marine Corps' commanding general,
but angry members of Congress on Thursday demanded her immediate
resignation.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Army said Lister thanked President
Bill Clinton and the Secretary of the Army for her opportunity to
serve the country and the Army.
</P>
<P>
Army Secretary Togo West said that "Lister has served soldiers,
civilians and their families with great dedication; however, we
certainly understand and respect her decision."
</P>
<P>
Lister, the Army's assistant secretary for manpower and reserve
affairs, made the comments on October 26 at a conference in
Baltimore sponsored by Harvard University's Institute for
Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
"I think the Army is much more connected to society than the
Marines," Lister said. "The Marines are extremists. Whenever you
have extremists, you've got some risks of total disconnection with
society. And that's a little dangerous," she added.
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Charles Krulak said that Lister's
remarks had dismissed "222 years of sacrifice and dedication" of
the Marines.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote to President Clinton calling
for her immediate dismissal.

<HEADLINE> Developmental Retardation of Obese Children Studied in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A study at No. four Hospital of
Harbin, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang province,
has shown that the accumulation of fat in the pituitary can cause
developmental retardation in obese children during puberty.
</P>
<P>
Around 10 percent of the corpulent children studied showed
developmental disturbances. The survey also shows that their
posterior pituitary gland was less dense than that of normal
children, hindering the secretion of a gonad stimulating hormone
during puberty and affecting the development of the sex organs.
</P>
<P>
So, researchers develped a "Degreasing Therapy" that involves
the use of medicines and a changed lifestyle. One part of the
therapy is the use of an enema to stimulate the development of
external genital organs and the prostate, and Chinese medicines
are used to reduce their weight and recover the normal functioning
of the pituitary gland.
</P>
<P>
"It is just not enough to take medicine. The most important
thing is to change corpulent children's lazy habits," says
Prof. Li Jiqi, a member of the China Sex Science Association.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also suggested a low-sugar, low-salt, high-protein,
and vitamin-rich diet for obese children. Clinical studies using
the therapy on 1,000 children have had good results, with 70
percent of them increasing development of the genital organs and
losing a great deal of weight.

one for Rafter, and hit 28 winners against Rafter's 13.
</P>
<P>
Rafter, the first Australian in the season-ending event since
Pat Cash in 1987, has beaten Sampras only once, in 1993. Sampras
has won all eight meetings since then, the last three in straight
sets.
</P>
<P>
Sampras will play Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman, who beat
second-ranked American Michael Chang 6-4, 7-5 in the White Group.
</P>
<P>
Bjorkman has jumped from No. 69 to No. 4 in the world after
winning three titles this year, including last week's tournament
in Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
Chang was making his sixth appearance in the championship. The
only time he advanced past the round-robin play was in 1995, when
he reached runner-up.
</P>
<P>
Spaniard Moya, Australian Open runner-up, will face Yevgeny
Kafelnikov of Russia.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, eliminated Thursday, withdrew from his last,
meaningless match against Kafelnikov with a back injury. The ATP
invited Tim Henman to replace him.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador On Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The universal
principles of human rights must be integrated with the specific
conditions of each country, Chinese Ambassador to the United
Nations Qin Huasun stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Third Committee (Social, humanitarian and
cultural)of the fifty-second session of General Assembly on the
question of human rights, Qin Huasun said mankind is at present at
a historical turn of the century. International activities in the
field of human rights are also at a critical crossroad. Reviewing
the past helps us gain new insights.
</P>
<P>
Qin said in carrying out commemorative activities for the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
five-year review of the Vienna Declaration and program of
Action, the international society should carefully summarize
experience and lessons of the past and ensure the development of
human rights activities into the next century in a right
direction.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the universal principles of human rights must be
integrated with specific conditions of each country. The
universally recognized principles governing human rights result
from the development of human civilization, which are of positive
significance to the future development of mankind and applicable
to every member of the international community.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China is of the view that it is normal for countries
to have differences on the question of human rights. What is
important is how to deal with these differences. Practices have
proved as long as countries enter into dialogue on an equal
footing and on the principles of mutual respect and seeking
common ground while reserving differences, they will be able to
enhance understanding and narrow differences.
</P>
<P>
Qin said China is not in favor of practicing power politics,
exerting political and economic pressure on countries with
different views and imposing one's own ideology and values on
others in the field of human rights. There are more and more
countries supporting to handle the question of human rights
through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Qin said the international community should take practical and
effective measures to remove at the earliest possible date various
unfair and irrational phenomena in the international field of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said in today's world, hegemonism and power
politics remains the major threat to world peace and stability.
The unfair and inequitable international economic order continues
to undermine the interests of developing countries. The gap
between the rich and the poor is further widening. War, poverty
and discrimination have deprived hundreds of millions of people of
their basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
Qin said a few countries use human rights as a political
instrument, pursue selectivity and double standards in the UN
human rights field and grossly interfere in the internal affairs
of developing countries. At the same time, economic, social and
cultural rights that developing countries are concerned about have
been long neglected and the implementation of the right to
development has long been delayed.
</P>
<P>
Qin called on the countries concerned to abandon prejudice and
self-interests and work together with developing countries to
reverse the current erroneous trend in the international field of
human rights and take effective measures to promote the global
realization of human rights and fundamental freedom.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jury Recommends Death for Pakistani in CIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- A United States jury today
decided Mir Aimal Kasi, a Pakistani, should get the death penalty
for killing two CIA employees in a shooting rampage outside the
spy agency's headquarters near Washington, D.C. in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Fairfax County jury, which convicted Kasi
on Monday, is only a recommendation, but Virginia judges generally
abide by such decisions.
</P>
<P>
The judge is expected to pronounce the final sentence on
January 23.
</P>
<P>
It took the panel less than seven hours. Kasi showed no emotion
as the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
Kasi, 33, was found guilty of killing Frank Darling, 28, and
another CIA employee, Lansing Bennett, 66, on January 25, 1993. In
the shootings, two other CIA employees and another person were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
Kasi returned his native Pakistan after the shooting. Following
four and a half years of manhunt, the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) tracked him to a Pakistani hotel and arrested
him in June, then brought him to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The jury's decision came two days after four Americans were
shot to death in Karachi, Pakistan, that U.S. lawmakers said was
apparently retaliation for the conviction on Monday.
</P>
<P>
A group that claimed responsibility for the killings threatened
more attacks if Kasi was sentenced to death, according to reports
from Pakistan.

<P>
WELLINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand First party
 failed this morning to decide whether to stay in the coalition
Government, Radio NZ Reported.
</P>
<P>
Party leader Winston Peters was due to announce his party's
decision on whether to stay in the future government led by new
National Party leader Jenny Shipley who replaced Jim Bolger early
this month.
</P>
<P>
NZ First is now having its annual convention in the South
Island city of Christchurch. Peters told delegates that the party
executive and caucus will meet separately tomorrow for further
talks on the decision.
</P>
<P>
The report also said Peters approached the Labor Party last
night on the possibility that NZ First supported a Labor
government if Labor agreed to the 5 billion-dollar (3.1 billion
U.S. dollar) extra spending and tax cuts contained in the
coalition agreement with National.
</P>
<P>
But Labor leader Helen Clark had turned down the offer, saying
that it would not be credible for Labor to form a government on NZ
First terms. She said there should be an early election.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges U.S. to Pressure Turkey on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Washington should pressure
Ankara into cooperating towards resolving the protracted Cyprus
problem, said Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after briefing Greek President Costis
Stephanopoulos on recent foreign policy developments, Pangalos
said that the initiative by U.S. presidential envoy on the Cyprus
issue, Richard Holbrooke, was important as far as the U. S.
undertook by all means at their disposal to pressure Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. could exert pressure by means of the military supplies
it gave Turkey and which were used in Cyprus, he said, adding
that Washington could limit those supplies or enforce a ban on
their use on the Aegean coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on criticism by the U.S. envoy that the European
Union (EU) had not undertaken any initiatives on the Cyprus issue,
he said that any effort by the EU to find a solution did not
require an "American mediator." "We can do this by ourselves," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been unofficially partitioned since 1974 when
Turkish troops took control of its northern third following an
abortive coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> American Nations Sign Convention Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-nine members of the
Organization of the American States (OAS) today signed a
convention against the illicit manufacturing and trafficking of
guns, ammunition and explosives.
</P>
<P>
A signing ceremony, which took place at the headquarters of
OAS in Washington, was attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
The convention is aimed at stemming the illicit manufacturing
of, and trafficking in firearms, ammunition, explosives and other
related materials.
</P>
<P>
"Gun trafficking is an issue of national security for our
governments, and a matter of neighborhood for all of us in the
Americas," Clinton said at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the document, Clinton added, shows that
countries on the West Hemisphere "are speaking with one voice,
acting with on conviction and leading toward one goal: to stem the
illegal flow of guns, ammunition and explosives in our hemisphere."
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that the new treaty will not affect the
lawful sale, ownership or use of guns.
</P>
<P>
Zedillo, who arrived here for a state visit on Thursday,
praised the U.S. and other OAS members for their support for his
proposal raised by him last year on the creation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"The most promising approach to confronting drug trafficking
and organized crime is an integrated strategy designed to respect
the sovereignty of each country and capable of taking full
advantage of the multilateral mechanisms that the international
community has at its disposal," said Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, OAS Secretary General Cesar Gaviria
called the convention a "powerful tool" that will help governments
protect "the people who walk down our streets and the children who
play in our parks."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Puts Gas Supply on Ration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today decided to ration
gas supply around the country starting Saturday in the face of
possible military actions taken by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the Oil Ministry, was announced on TV
Friday evening. The ministry cited swelling crowds and long queues
in gas stations as the reason for the latest rationing.
</P>
<P>
Under the new regulations, gas supply to a private car will be
curtailed to 40 liters for every four days while taxi and minibus
can get only twice as much during the same time span.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe this is a step taken by the Baghdad
government to prepare itself for a possible military showdown with
the U.S., which has ordered its aircraft carrier George Washington
to join another one USS Nimitz in the Persian Gulf for
"contingencies."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has vowed to shoot down any U.S. plane overflying Iraq on
inspection missions and refused to back down on its demands that

UNITED NATIONS, November 14 (Xinhua) -- The excessive accumulation
and illicit circulation of small arms and light weapons will greatly
worsen the situation and increase conflicts in the regions of turmoil,
Sha Zukang, Chinese ambassador on disarmament, said at the U.N.
headquarters here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Commission of the Disarmament and International
Security, Sha said that the illicit circulation of such arms will also
lead to expansion of terrorism and drug trafficking, hindering the
social and economic development in different regions.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese delegation is for a proper disposal of the
excessive accumulation of small arms and opposes resolutely any
countries' engagement in illicit circulation of any weapons, which
brutally interferes in the internal affairs of the sovereign countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also noted that the just needs of relevant
countries in self-defense and security should be put into full
consideration, while exercising the weapon control.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Second Carrier to Gulf a "Prudent Measure" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 14 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton
argued for his sending the aircraft carrier George Washington to
the Persian Gulf, saying it was a "prudent measure" for any
contingency, which might occur amid rising tension with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I have ordered today the aircraft carrier George Washington
to the region as a prudent measure to help assure that we have
the forces we need for any contingency," the president told
reporters at a White House briefing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, Clinton announced the move during a
photo session with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo. He said
that "it was appropriate under the circumstances" to order the
George Washington from Mediterranean to the Gulf to join
another aircraft carrier Nimitz, already deployed there.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the second carrier, expected about a week
later, would double the number of American Navy warplanes in the
Gulf, putting some 100 combat aircraft and another 50 support
aircraft in the region.
</P>
<P>
On its way to the Persian Gulf, the George Washington will be
accompanied by the USS Annapolis, an attack submarine, the
destroyer USS Carney and the cruiser USS Normandy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the George Washington, the Pentagon also is
considering sending F-117 stealth fighters, and other Air Force
warplanes to the region as a major military buildup, some
officials said after the announcement of the dispatch of the
second carrier.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States would continue on diplomatic
front to impose pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein so
that he could be forced to reverse his policy toward U.N.
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"The United States will work intensively with our allies and
our friends in the region and around the world to convince Iraq
to comply with the will of the international community as
expressed in the United nations resolution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton supported U-2 mission under U.N. order to fly over
Iraq next week, because "without inspectors on the ground, it is
more important than ever to monitor events from the air."

Democrats failed earlier in the day to win enough votes to send it
to the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
Among its options, the White House could send up a new nominee
who would draw less criticism from Republicans opposed to Lee's
support of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also could put Lee in the job on an interim basis, with
Congress adjourned for winter recess.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what he does. At this point, it's dead," Hatch
said of the Lee nomination. He suggested Clinton "find somebody
for this position who will build a consensus."
</P>
<P>
Supporters want the White House to resubmit Lee because they
intend to intensify efforts to build grassroots support for a full
Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
Democrats blocked a Senate Judiciary Committee vote Thursday
that would have killed the nomination. Hatch, rather than leave
the nomination in limbo, had the nomination returned to the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
But Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute for Justice,
who has led the opposition to Lee, said, "Clinton should withdraw
the nomination."
</P>
<P>
Hatch and other critics of affirmative action say Lee is wrong
for the job and that his support of such efforts will cloud his
judgment. Hatch also disagrees with the administration in its
support for affirmative action.
