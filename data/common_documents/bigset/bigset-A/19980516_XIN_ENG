<HEADLINE> Blair to Make Another Trip to N.Ireland Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair is
planning another trip to Northern Ireland next week, the third
visit this month, a government spokesman announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
"He is determined to up his involvement and continue to
maintain the momentum," the spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who came back from a one-day visit to
Northern Ireland only Thursday, decided a new trip after an
opinion poll in Dublin's Irish Times newspaper showed that backing
for the deal in Northern Ireland had slipped to 56 percent from 73
percent a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the poll, only 35 percent of the pro-British
unionist community planned to vote 'yes' and 45 percent were
against last month's deal.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, support for the deal in the Irish Republic has
risen by 11 points to 72 percent, with only five percent of the
electorate planning to vote "no".
</P>
<P>
The fate of the Northern Ireland peace agreement, reached on
April 10 by the eight political parties, will be decided by the
voters of both sides of the Irish border on May 22.
</P>
<P>
Blair's spokesman said that secret polling by Britain's
Northern Ireland Office had shown that a recent appearance by
Blair on Ulster Television had had "a significant result" but he
decided to give further details about the polling.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Newspapers Condemn India's Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Canada's major newspapers condemned
Friday India's nuclear tests, saying that the country is playing
with fire and will pay the price of international brinksmanship.
</P>
<P>
India's nuclear tests are "flouting a foundational norm of the
modern order" and "undermining global security", the Globe and
Mail newspaper said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
"India's arrogant bravado in detonating two more nuclear-weapons
tests this week despite widespread international condemnation is
appalling," said the Gazette newspaper in its editorial.
</P>
<P>
While noting India's recent nationalist remarks, the paper
said: "These dangerously misguided statements from the birthplace
of Gandhi show how removed India has become from mainstream
international opinion."
</P>
<P>
The paper called for measures to contain a nuclear threat
caused by India's tests. "It must be made to understand that a
nuclear outlaw can't expect business to continue as usual."
</P>
<P>
Canada's major business daily, The Financial Post, described
India's nuclear tests as "playing with fire".
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to tell if this crisis will evolve into a
tit-for-tat arms race between the two foes (India and Pakistan),"
the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, UNDCP to Start New Drug Eradication Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and the U.N. International
Drug Control Program (UNDCP) will start a major alternative
development project for the Wa area in the country's northern Shan
state, a UNDCP official said here Friday at the end of his
five-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Pino Arlacchi, executive director of the UNDCP, told a press
briefing that the project will have a direct impact on 30,000
people at an estimated cost of 15 million U.S. dollars over a
five-year period and will strike at the heart of the illicit
heroin and methamphetamine production and trafficking area.
</P>
<P>
He expects support from the international community for the
UNDCP's efforts to combat drug trafficking and abuse through its
new "world strategy" that has been endorsed by all member states
of the latest commission on narcotic drugs which met in Vienna two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
He praised some previous cooperation projects with Myanmar as
successful.
</P>
<P>
Pino arrived here Monday to obtain first-hand information
concerning the drug control problem facing Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he discussed with the Myanmar authorities a
15-year plan for the total elimination of opium.
</P>
<P>
He also toured the border areas in Kokang and Wa regions and
discussed with local authorities the current drug control
situation in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar cooperated with the UNDCP in drug elimination in three
projects of integrated rural development in eastern Shan state's
Mongyang and Tachilek and Southern Wa region's Wan Ho Tao since
1994 and the projects were successfully completed in 1996 and
1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
The UNDCP has also been involved in some multilateral anti-drug
cooperation projects between Myanmar and its neighboring
countries.

<HEADLINE> Permit to Export Lake Water to Be Cancelled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian province of Ontario
says it plans to cancel a controversial permit that would allow a
company to take water from Lake Superior and export to Asia,
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The province granted the permit two weeks ago, which had led to
sharp criticism from environmentalists and Canada's federal
government.
</P>
<P>
Ontario Environment Minister Norm Sterling said Thursday that
the province has drawn up a new policy restricting the transfer of
water out of the province's water basins, including the Great
Lakes.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that he intends to withdraw the
controversial permit granted to Nova Group of Sault Ste. Marie
late last month, which hoped to export 600 million litres of
freshwater a year to Asia.
</P>
<P>
The federal government of Canada welcomed the province's
intention to cancel the permit. "It makes it easier" for Ottawa to
figure out how to ban water exports for good, said federal
Environment Minister Christine Stewart.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the controversy over the export of water may not go away
in Canada even if the permit is withdrawn in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
Another Canadian company is reported to have won the support of
Newfoundland government for its plan to export 52 billion litres
of water a year from Gisborne Lake on the southcoast of the
province.
</P>
<P>
That's about 87 times the amount proposed by the Nova Group
from Ontario province.
</P>
<P>
The water export plan is now awaiting final approval from the
province and from the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans,
the reports said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Up Slightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite the fall-out from the
Asian financial crisis, the United States industrial output edged
0.1 percent higher in April, the Federal Reserve said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The slim increase in production at factories, mines and
utilities, which was better than expected, followed a moderate 0.3
percent gain in March and drops of 0.3 percent in February and
January.
</P>
<P>
In April, at factories alone, output rose 0.3 percent, but that
followed March's 0.2 percent drops and February's 0.4 percent
decrease.
</P>
<P>
In utilities, production slumped a seasonally adjusted 1.9
percent after March's 6 percent rise, due to a return to more
normal temperatures after a mild January and February.
</P>
<P>
In mines and oil wells, production saw a 0.2 percent plunge,
the third consecutive drop.
</P>
<P>
Production was bolstered in April by gains in automobiles,
though the level there remained below year-end output, and by
computers, home appliances, carpeting, semiconductors, lumber,
furniture, rubber, plastics and communication equipment.
</P>
<P>
However, the monthly output declined in tobacco, cigarettes,
chemicals, paper and aircraft.

<HEADLINE> New Car Sales in Western  Europe Fall in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- New Car sales in western Europe fell
1.7 percent year-on-year last month, the first time this year,
according to figures from the European Automobile Manufacturers'
Association (EAMA) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The EAMA blamed the Easter holidays, which fell in April
instead of March as in last year, for the drop as it cut the
number of sales days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the association said another factor leading to the
fall was a 14 percent drop in sales in Germany, the region's
largest single market.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that buyers in Germany had pulled forward
purchases into March to escape a one percent value added tax rise
from April 1.
</P>
<P>
It said that adjusting for the distortions, underlying growth
in April was about six percent.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fall last month, new car sales in the first quarter
of this year were still 8.1 percent up over the same period last
year and were higher-than-expected.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that the Volkswagen group further tightened its
grasp on the region's market leadership, with a market share of
19.1 percent, up from last April's 17.8 percent, and was more than
five percentage points ahead of its nearest rival, Italy's Fiat
group.
</P>
<P>
However, sales by General Motors fell by 18 percent
year-on-year in April, followed by Ford, down 14.8 percent, and
BMW, down 13.3.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and the United
States will hold their six-monthly summit next Monday in London
where the Helms-Burton law will be a key and thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit will discuss trade-related issues such as
the U.S. extraterritorial legislation, as embodied in the
Helms-Burton legislation which effects investment in Cuba, and
present concerns for the World Trade Organization ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, still negotiating with the United States
for a solution to the problem of U.S. extraterritorial laws, has
stressed that the Helms-Burton and D'Amato laws are not only
illegal but also counterproductive since they make EU-U.S.
cooperation more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are expected to raise concerns about the EU's
approach toward hormones in beef and its policy on the import of
bananas.
</P>
<P>
The EU-U.S. trade and investment relationship is the biggest
in the world, and its health is vital to each other and the global
trading system, according to European Commission officials.
</P>
<P>
More than 350 billion ECU worth of goods and services are
traded between the European Union and the United States each year
and each partner is the other's largest source and destination of
foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
The European Union and the United States signed, on December 3,
1995, a New Transatlantic Agenda which framed the transatlantic
relationship in promoting peace and stability, responding to
global challenges, contributing to the expansion of world trade
and building bridges across the Atlantic.

<P>
PARIS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- France Friday sent its condolences on
the death of the U.S. singer and actor Frank Sinatra, who is very
popular in France although sometimes seen as a symbol of U.S.
cultural imperialism.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac described Sinatra as "an
immense figure of art and spectacle" and a "hot and passionate
personality."
</P>
<P>
"His talent, his charisma, his voice accompanied and made our
epoch dreaming," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of Culture and Communications Catherine
Trautmann called the crooner "an unbelievable singer (chanteur
fou)" and idol of several generations.
</P>
<P>
She said that few artists could have a career as long and as
brilliant as his.
</P>
<P>
The Cannes International Film Festival now being held in the
southern French Mediterranean city also paid homage to the
legendary singer.
</P>
<P>
The French media called Sinatra the "icon" of the American
civilization and "the voice" of America for his numerous
successful songs.
</P>
<P>
Sinatra died on Friday in Los Angeles at the age of 82.

ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Army Chief General
Jahangir Karamat Friday evening held an hour-long meeting with the
visiting high-level U.S. delegation on the regional situation
arising from India's series of nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
General Karamat informed the U.S. delegation, led by Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, of Pakistan's security concerns
in the wake of Indian nuclear tests earlier this week, defense
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian action, which poses an immediate and grave threat to
Pakistan, is a serious blow to the international non-proliferation
efforts, the sources quoted Karamat as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the U.S. delegation, which arrived here Friday
morning, briefed the Pakistani army chief on the U.S. perception
of the current South Asian situation and sanctions against India
imposed by the international community.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources did not go into the details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. delegation held a 90-minute-long meeting with
Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan and both sides
described the discussion as "good."
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the American delegation, as said by the U.S.
Embassy here Friday, will "be describing the full impact of
sanctions imposed on India by the U.S. and other nations as well
as counseling restraint on Pakistan's part in its response to the
Indian move."

<HEADLINE> Tough Times for Zimbabwe's Timber Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's timber industry is
facing hard times due to low demand on the troubled domestic
market and turmoil in the traditional Asian export markets.
</P>
<P>
"The regional markets, particularly South Africa, remain in an
oversupply situation. Despite strong economic fundamentals, the
timber consuming sectors have failed to achieve anticipated
levels of consumption," the Zimbabwe News Agency Friday quoted a
statement from Border Timbers Ltd. as saying.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation prevailing in southeast Asia, and in
particular South Korea, virtually eliminated this market for the
foreseeable future, the company said.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, these difficulties have resulted in the major
timber producing countries of south America and Australia
increasing their level of exports into the European and north
American markets," it said.
</P>
<P>
The consequent oversupply situation in those markets had
produced depressed prices for timber products.
</P>
<P>
Although management was exploring other international markets
and a number of options were being considered, it said, the
outlook for the year was not optimistic.

<P>
HARARE, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's flue-cured tobacco
growers agreed Friday to withhold their crop from auction floors
until May 26 to allow time for consultations on low prices being
offered this year.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is the country's biggest foreign currency earner.
Flue-cured tobacco is realising an average 1.27 U.S. Dollars per
kg compared with last year's 1.65 U.S. Dollars per kg, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Paul Webb, president of Zimbabwe Tobacco Association, said
Friday that the decision of the growers would allow the
government, growers, merchants and buyers to resolve the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to him, growers in Malawi, Zambia, South Africa and
Tanzania supported the move.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Lands and Agriculture Minister Kumbirai Kangai said
the move by tobacco growers was logical as prices they were
receiving were below production costs.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations over the issue were underway between the
government and growers, said the minister.

LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain tops the world in the
proportion of unmarried teenage mothers, with 87 percent of
adolescent births in the country occurring outside marriage,
national newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a survey of 53 countries all over the world, the

significantly higher than in most third world countries.
</P>

The study said that poverty and a lack of education and
employment opportunities were behind the trend in Britain and it

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May, 15 (Xinhua) -- From July 1, South Korea will allow
foreigners to purchase land of any area for whatever purpose, in a
bid to revitalize the domestic real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Under the new real estate law passed on Friday by the South
Korean National Assembly, when a foreign company takes over a
domestic firm, it will also be allowed to possess the firm's land
in its name.
</P>
<P>
The current real estate law bans land sales to foreigners
except when the land is to used for factories, offices and
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
The present real estate law entitles foreigners who have lived
in the country for five years to buy 660 square meters of land for
residency and 165 square meters of land for commercial purpose,
but non-residential aliens have no right to buy land.
</P>
<P>
The new law, which simplifies the land purchase procedures,
will enable a foreign land buyer to get the permit upon the
signing of the contract. Under the old law, it takes at least two
months for foreigners to get the permit.

Some 45 people including parliamentarians from the SAARC
countries -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka -- attended the meeting organized by the
Lower House Population and Social Committee of Nepal.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Vows to Give Priority to National Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif said Friday that his country "will give top priority to
national security" and it is closely watching the situation
arising from Indian nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan does not need any foreign assistance and will take
all decisions in the best interest of the nation," Sharif said
after meeting with a high-level U.S. delegation led by Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, which is here on a mission to
convince Pakistan not to follow India's suit.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the international community should
"realize Pakistan's serious concern over the Indian nuclear
tests."
</P>
<P>
"We have the nuclear capability but we have not used it for
nuclear test as Pakistan is a responsible nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has extended invitation to India to resume official
talks but "India's attitude disappointed us," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Indian nuclear tests are a matter of concern for us," he said.
"My government is studying as to whether the international
sanctions on India are hard or soft."
</P>
<P>
To a question concerning possible U.S. sanctions against
Pakistan if the country goes nuclear, the prime minister said,
"Pakistan has already been facing sanctions, it is not new for
us."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.S. delegation, sent by President Bill Clinton
immediately after the Indian nuclear tests, also held talks with
Pakistani Army Chief General Jahangir Karamat and Foreign Minister
Gohar Ayub Khan.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Drug Tamoxifen Can Save Lives of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Another 20,000 lives each year could
be saved worldwide if the breast cancer drug tamoxifen was gaven a
much wider use, British scientists have claimed.
</P>
<P>
Tamoxifen, which works by blocking the female hormone
oestrogen, has not usually been given to younger patients because
doctors did not believe it helped pre-menopausal women.
</P>
<P>
But writing Friday in The Lancet medical journal, researchers
from Oxford University said that a global study of 30,000 women
has overturned this pereception, showing that tamoxifen can also
be a life-saver of young breast cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
Professor Richard Peto, from Oxford University, Thursday
presented the results at a news conference, saying that "Starting
tamoxifen immediately after breast cancer surgery prevented one in
six women from relapsing and one in twelve from dying,
irrespective of age."
</P>
<P>
The research, coordinated by the Clinical Trial Service Unit at
Oxford, brought together detailed information from 55 randomized
trials conducted over the past two decades in 15 countries.
</P>
<P>
It showed that starting tamoxifen early and continuing it for
around five years halved the recurrence rate and improved
long-term survival, even in younger women.
</P>
<P>
The drug was found effective whether or not chemotherapy had
been given, and whether or not the cancer had already spread to
the local lymph glands.
</P>
<P>
Although results showed tamoxifen can cause small risks of
cancer of the lining of the womb or a blood clot in the lungs,
researchers said the drug prevented 30 times as many deaths as it
caused.

<HEADLINE> German Far-Right Party to Stand in National Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The far-right German People's Union
announced Friday that it will stand in country's national
elections in September this year in an attempt to win seats in the
federal parliament in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in the southern German city of Munich,
the far-right party, known by its German initials as the DVU, said
that it hoped to win as many as nine percent of the vote in the
September elections so as to be represented in the federal
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Under the German election law, a party must break a
five-percent threshold in order to be seated in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to DVU's announcement on Friday, German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said that he was sure neither the DVU nor any other
far-right parties would be voted into the Bonn parliament.
</P>
<P>
"None of the rightwing parties will take the five-percent
hurdle. We must do everything to ensure this," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
The DVU, a fiercely anti-immigrant group of rightist
nationalists, has emerged as the fastest-growing German party on
the far right, feeding on voter resentment over the country's
double-digit unemployment and the large population of foreign
immigrants who are accused by rightist extremists of stealing jobs
and milking the country's generous social welfare benefits.
</P>
<P>
Campaigning on a platform calling for expulsion of "all foreign
bandits" and "jobs first for Germans only", the party scored a
stunning 12.9 percent of the vote in the regional legislature
election of the eastern German Saxony-Anhalt state last month.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest gains of a far-right party in any state
assembly votes in Germany since 1945, which also enabled the DVU
to become the first radical right party to enter a state assembly
in eastern Germany since the 1990 German reunification.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Top Banker Says Reform Key to African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
Governor Micah Cheserem has said painful economic reforms are
Africa's only way out of deep economic mire and poverty.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the CBK monthly report for May, which was available
Friday, Cheserem said those African countries which implemented
appropriate reforms have consistently achieved high economic
growth, some as high as 10 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
"Many African countries have, however, undertaken far-reaching
economic reforms within the last 10 years, which are now yielding
positive results," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Like in a surgery, most economic reforms entail temporary
pain but assure long-term gain," claimed Cheserem, who is
reportedly a firm advocate of strict monetary policy and
belt-tightening.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the debate in Africa was shifting to how
fast and in what sequence reforms should be implemented, from
whether or not they were required in the first place.
</P>
<P>
Evidence of Africa's economic despair was seen in excessive
donor dependence, high levels of crime, wars and civil unrest,
and low and falling per capita incomes exacerbated by high
population growth rates, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He saw further evidence of the despair in worsening
infrastructure, rampant unemployment, abject poverty and
unsustainable debts caused by unmanageable budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
"The great economic hopes at attainment of independence have
not been realized by many African countries," he said,adding
"They remain economically dependent on the West."
</P>
<P>
He urged faster privatization of state enterprises across the
continent and granting of autonomy to the managers of public
institutions that include local authorities and universities.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Voices Grave Concern over Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
expressed grave concern over the Indian nuclear tests, saying he
would seek a "strong and unambiguous" denunciation at the Group of
Eight (G8) summit due to open later Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that India carried out second round of nuclear
tests on Wednesday despite universal opposition, triggering fresh
wide-spread criticism across the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, Clinton, who is in Birmingham to attend the G8 summit,
noted that he would appeal to all the participating leaders to
condemn India by saying "I hope they will be as strong and
unambiguous as possible."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, whose government has imposed economic sanctions on
India, paid tribute to Japanese government for agreeing to cut off
economic assistance to India.
</P>
<P>
On the same occassion, Prime Minister Hashimoto said that the
Japanese government was "extremely concerned" over the current
developments in India.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a British Presidency spokesman told a press briefing
that the G8 leaders are expected to issue a strong statement on
the Indian nuclear tests during the three-day summit.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Inflationary pressure eased in
Kenya in April, thanks to improved basic food supplies, the
stability of the Shilling and the restrained expansion of money
supply, the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has said.
</P>
<P>
The underlying three-month annualized inflation fell to 26
percent in April from 34.2 percent in March, according to the May
edition of the CBK Monthly Economic Review available Friday.
</P>
<P>
Overall inflation also declined last month mainly as a result
of the slower pace of price hikes for basic foods over the first
three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The improved availability of basic foods implied that the food
price inflation went up by only 3.7 percent in the year to April
compared with the increase of 22.8 percent in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Food therefore contributed only 15.7 percentage points to
April's month-on-month inflation compared with 57.1 percentage
points over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The three-month annualized inflation went down to 13.1 percent
in April from 34.7 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The overall month-on-month inflation fell to 7.0 percent from
8.1 percent, while the average annual inflation declined to 9.9
percent from 10.6 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
The month-on-month inflation for the lower income group fell
to 5.9 from 7.1 percent in March. The figure for the middle and
upper income groups also fell to 10.5 and 10.6 percent from 11.7
and 10.8 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it's managing to maintain the annual
expansion in broad money supply below 8.3 percent so as to ensure
that the month-on-month inflation is brought down and confined
below five percent by June, the first month of next budget year.
</P>
<P>
The government budget deficit should also be reduced to below
2.4 percent of gross domestic product by that time, the bank
noted.

<HEADLINE> EU-Russia Summit Releases Joint Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Birmingham, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The EU-Russia relation has
started a new stage since the EU-Russia Partnership and
Cooperation Agreement entered into force on December 1, 1997, an
official joint statement said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have moved quickly to set up the mechanisms that will
implement the agreement," added the statement adopted by Tony
Blair, President of the Council of the European Union, Jacques
Santer, President of the European Commission, and Boris Yeltsin,
President of the Russian Federation.
</P>
<P>
Stating the role the EU/Russia is going to play, the statement
said: "The EU-Russia strategic partnership based on shared values
and interests will do much to enhance peace, stability and
prosperity on the European continent."
</P>
<P>
Referring to how to further their relationship, the statement
said, the integration of Russia into the world economy has been at
the "core" of their discussion on the EU-Russia relations.
</P>
<P>
The recent decision of the EU to remove Russia from the list of
countries with non-market economy status for anti-dumping purposes
recognizes Russia's substantial progress and will further promote
commercial and economic ties, it added.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also discussed the enlargement of the EU, the Middle
East peace process, the situation in Kosovo, environmental
protection and other issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Two Thousand Genocide Suspects Plead Guilty in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 15 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 genocide suspects from
Rilima Prison, in Ngenda Commune, about 50 km south of the
Rwandan capital Kigali have pleaded guilty and confessed their
involvement in the 1994 blood-letting.
</P>
<P>
"The guilty was made in front of officials of Rwandan Ministry
of Justice and some western donors," a senior official in the
Justice Department told the Rwanda News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government was represented by Gerard Gahima,
secretary general in the Ministry of Justice, who was accompanied
by representatives from the United States, Belgium, Canada, and
Holland who have contributed a lot to the recovery process of the
Rwandan judicial system which was ruined by war and the genocide.
</P>
<P>
As indicated by Gahima, the government has welcomed these
waves of confessions which were a result of sustained
sensitization campaigns in Rwandan prisons about the genocide
law.
</P>
<P>
Under this law on the punishment of genocide crimes, suspects
who plead guilty and confess about their crimes see their
sentence reduced.
</P>
<P>
However, the suspects have ignored this segment of the law
because of negative campaigning by some bad elements which
reportedly had misinformed the detainees that because of their
big number, the government will not be able to try them and would
subsequently release them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's confessions at Rilima prison where over 7,000
genocide suspects are currently detained followed those of 15
suspects of Kigali prison.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts in the Rwandan capital believe that the
flood of confessions at Rilima were triggered by the public
execution of 22 genocide suspects three weeks ago, and the recent
guilty plea made by former Rwandan interim prime minister Jean
Kambanda in Arusha, Tanzania before the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan hoped that the leaders of the group of industrialized
nations will give positive consideration to his proposals on
Africa at their summit in Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday,
Annan said, "A strong endorsement by the Summit of the United
Nations and its many contributions would be most welcome".
</P>
<P>
A copy of the letter was made available by the U.N. Public
Information Office on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was grateful for the supportive comments by G-8
foreign and finance ministers regarding the U.N. and and the
success of the U.N. reforms during their meetings held in London
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said: "the Foreign and Finance Ministers
also referred generously to recent report on the Causes of
Conflict and the Promotion of Durable Peace and Sustainable
Development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"That report included a number of recommendations on the
subjects of international aid and debt relief, the implementation
of which requires the cooperation of your countries.
</P>
<P>
"The decline in levels of development assistance needs to be
reversed, aid should be restructured to target high impact areas,
and a larger share of aid to Africa should be spent in Africa
itself.
</P>
<P>
"More over, the current debt burden for many African countries
is unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
"My report recommends that all donor nations convert into
grants the remaining official bilateral debts of the poorest
African countries, and that access to the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries Debt Initiative be broadened significantly so more
African countries can be accommodated at an early opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"I very much hope that the G8 leaders will give positive
consideration to these proposals."
</P>
<P>
Annan submitted his report to the Security Council on April 16
followed by his 12-day-long 8-country East African trip ending on
May 10.
</P>
<P>
He will brief the Security Council on the journey next week,

<HEADLINE> Palestinians in Lebanon Mark 50 Years of Their </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Palestinian refugees
across Lebanon Friday went into their second day of activities to
commemorate their expulsion from Palestine by Israel 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians in the Baddawi and al Bared refugee camps in
northern Lebanon's coastal city of Tripoli held a march inside the
camps, chanting slogans denouncing Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, students binding their heads with black cloth
released helium balloons carrying the names of Palestinian towns
and villages, some of which have become part of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since Israel was created on May 14, 1948, more than 700,000
Palestinians have been forced to flee their homes and live as
refugees throughout the world, mainly in neighboring Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Angered Palestinians in Lebanon's largest camp at Ain
al-Hilweh, east of southern coastal city of Sidon, set fire to car
tires at one of the entrances to the camp and burned Israeli and
the U.S. flags.
</P>
<P>
Similar protests were also held at refugee camps in the
country's eastern part of Bekaa where Palestinians suffered the
heaviest air raid in more than two years by Israeli warplanes two
days ago. At least 10 Palestinians were killed and 27 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
In the capital of Beirut, Palestinians staged a sit-in in front
of the office belonging to the United Nations Relief and Works
Agency (UNRWA) which is in charge of affairs of Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
They presented a statement to the agency, in which they urged
the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to "step in to bring about
the implementation of U.N. resolutions that guarantee our people
the right of self-determination, to return home and set up an
independent state with Jerusalem as the capital."
</P>
<P>
A total of 360,000 Palestinians are now living under the
financial support of the UNRWA in 12 camps across Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They are not granted work permit and banned from leaving and
entering the country by the Lebanese government.

ISLAMABAD, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz

held detailed discussions on the geopolitical situation in South
Asia in the wake of Indian nuclear tests earlier this week.
</P>

According to a press release issued by the Foreign Office

has been perilously destabilized besides the fact that the
strategic situation has been fundamentally altered, posing new
dilemmas and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, who is leading a high-caliber U.S. delegation,
explained that the United States views the Indian tests as an
extremely negative development.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Japan have already imposed harsh
sanctions against India and the Group-8 summit meeting in Britain
will also formulate a "strong and firm" response, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sharif informed the U.S. officials that the Indian action has
posed a serious threat to Pakistan's national security.
</P>
<P>
Talbott recognized the threat to Pakistan's security and stated
that the United States considers Pakistan as a friend and that it
is against destabilization of the region.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister assured the U.S. deputy secretary of state
that Pakistan would give consideration to the U.S. assessment and
views.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would, in the final analysis, respond in consonance
with the magnitude of the threat it faces and the requirements of
its security and national interests, he said.

<HEADLINE> Forest Fires Crisis in Southeast Asia Far from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The crisis caused by forest
fires in South East Asia is far from over, the Executive Director
of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) Klaus Toefer
warned on Thursday, according to U.N. Public Information Office.
</P>
<P>
Asked by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to coordinate U.N.
response to the fires amid reports of sporadic rainfall in East
Kalimantan, Indonesia, Toefer said that "a repetition of the
emergency of 1997 is quite possible", adding that this is not the
time to be complacent.
</P>
<P>
The recent rainfall has not been adequate and the issue must
stay at the top of the international agenda, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fires are still burning in many locations and with the imminent
start of the dry season new fires can be expected at any time.
</P>
<P>
Last month in Geneva, Toefer presented a 10 million U.S. dollar
short-term action plan to donor countries to provide training for
fire fighters and assistance to Indonesia. So far the response has
been inadequate, the U.N. Office said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
Over 300,000 hectares have burned in East Kalimantan this year.
Most of the fires were set by people clearing land, but some of
the problem has been blamed on the drought caused by the El Nino
phenomenon.

<HEADLINE> G8 Leaders Kick off Annual Summit in Birmingham </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- State or government leaders from
the Group of Eight (G8) countries kicked off their annual summit
Friday evening in Birmingham, promising to set out clear
directions on major issues of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of the Birmingham summit, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, whose country is the current G8 president,
urged his fellow partners to make joint efforts in preventing the
summit from becoming a "talking shop".
</P>
<P>
Blair noted that G8 leaders "should set out some clear
directions on financial standards and the international financial
system and produce greater openness and transparency" in a bid to
make sure the Asian financial crisis would not be replicated.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the the Birmingham summit should
"underlie the degree to which global markets can not work properly
unless there are clear accounting standards and measures of
transparency that countries are prepared to adopt."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of fighting against international crime, Blair
expressed his government's hope that the G8 leaders would endorse
some "specific measures" to make it easier to combat international
organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Early Friday, U.S. President Bill Clinton told reporters that
he would seek a "strong and unambiguous" denunciation of India's
nuclear tests, which has triggered wide-spread criticism.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United States and Japan had decided to
impose economic sanctions against India.
</P>
<P>
A British government spokesman said that the G8 leaders are
expected to issue a strong statement to condemn India's nuclear
tests, but he ruled out the possibility of adopting a " G8
sanctions package."
</P>
<P>
During the three-day conference, the leaders from the United
States, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan, Russia and Britain
would also discuss employment, environment protection, debts
relief, the situation in Kosovo and the Middle East peace process.

<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese and Malaysian leaders
Friday lashed out at India's recent nuclear tests, saying the move
will lead to another round of nuclear arms race in south Asia.
</P>
<P>
India's five nuclear tests within 48 hours earlier this week
will destabilize the region, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Muhammed said at a joint press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
"India should use its resources in developing its economy and
combating poverty," El-Bashir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his government decries any nuclear tests even if
the doer is a friendly country, urging the concerned parties to
stop the tendency to conduct nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
He left here for home Friday afternoon after a three-day visit
to Sudan.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Khartoum, the Malaysian prime minister
signed with the Sudanese side a number of agreements on the
initiation of a joint ministerial committee, boosting the trade
exchange and encouraging bilateral investment.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the Malaysian leader's visit is to promote the
investment of his country in the fields of oil exploration and
extraction, diplomatic sources here said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The Lagos Police Command Friday expressed
concern over the rising incidents of murder in the state following a
spate of killings in recent two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The official News Agency of Nigeria quoted senior police sources as
saying that people in the state were easily mowed down with guns over
simple arguments or over failed business recently.
</P>
<P>
The latest development has forced the police to have a rethink of
the whole security situation in the state, which is the commercial and
industrial center as the former capital seat of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to police, the killings in the busy areas of the
state show a high proliferation of arms.
</P>
<P>
The force records no fewer than 20 gun-related murders every week,
a figure the force said was becoming alarming.
</P>
<P>
The rising murder cases could be attributed to the smuggling of
firearms through the various border posts in the last one year, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Only recently, Lagos police discovered large consignment of
cartridges abandoned in the border post concealed in bags of foodstuff,
medicines and other consumable items imported through neighboring
Benin.
</P>
<P>
Security agents in the border posts have been put on high alert as
a reaction to the incidents, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Curb Illegal Firearms Along Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia will establish several
border posts along the Zambian-Angolan border to control
proliferation of illegal firearms from Angola, a government
official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Home Affairs Deputy Minister Peter Muunga said the
Zambian government is concerned with the growing insecurity on
the border with Angola where villagers are reportedly obtaining
military guns from that country in exchange for food.
</P>
<P>
He said the proliferation of guns in the area is threatening
security in his country.
</P>
<P>
He said some of guns could be the ones being used by criminals
who are terrorizing people in Lusaka and other parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Some people are taking advantage of the absence of security
check points to trade in firearms and therefore there is need to
establish security check points along the border to curb crime,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Muunga said that more than 1,000 guns have been confiscated by
the country's security forces since 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, villagers in Sinjembela in Western Province
bordering Angola confiscated 211 AK-47 riffles since 1995 from
villagers who obtained them from Angola in exchange for food.

<HEADLINE> Kabila to Cooperate With UN in Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Kabila, President of
the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), has committed himself to
resolving a dispute with the United Nations over an investigation
into human rights abuses, South African Press Association (SAPA)
quoted a senior South African diplomat as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kabila said he will discuss the possibility of a UN team
returning to the DRC to continue its investigation into alleged
abuses in his country, Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad said
after he and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki met Kabila for more
than three hours.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan withdrew the UN team from the
DRC last month, accusing the government of obstructing attempts
to investigate alleged massacres of Hutu refugees by Kabila's
forces and Rwandan Tutsi allies.
</P>
<P>
Kabila had given assurances that a constituent assembly will
be in place by June and that democratic multi-party elections
will be held by June 1999, Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the steps we can take to help consolidate the
democratic process," Pahad was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was agreed that South Africa will send technical teams to
the DRC soon to assist in its economic transformation.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and Pahad also held talks with Salim Salim,
secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity, and
Namibian President Sam Nujoma.
</P>
<P>
They are in Kinshasa to attend a regional summit on security
issues, which was postponed just hours before it was scheduled to
begin Friday morning because of tension between Eritrea and
Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki's spokesman Ricky Naidoo said the two countries are
members of the summit's organizing committee and tension between
them over recent cross-border raids forced the postponement of
the summit.

The South African delegation were due to return to South

LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- A hard-line Protestant guerrilla
group in Northern Ireland announced on Friday it was calling for
an unequivocal ceasefire but still urged voters to reject the
peace deal in the upcoming referendum.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), which
previously refused to join in ceasefires of the main Protestant
guerrilla groups, declared an "unequivocal ceasefire".
</P>
<P>
The statement was read out by one of six armed and masked LVF
members at a news conference that said the organization was
calling for the truce to create "a proper climate" in which voters
could make up their minds.
</P>
<P>
The LVF called on voters to oppose the deal in the referendum
next Friday, saying the deal was a sell-out and a Yes vote would
mean Northern Ireland would be "lost forever."
</P>
<P>
"We continue to be of the view that we cannot in conscience
recommend this agreement to the people of Northern Ireland," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The LVF, which is thought to have killed 11 Roman Catholic
Irish nationalists since last December, is a maverick group that
believes recent peace moves will lead to an ending of British rule
and a merger of Northern Ireland with the neighboring Irish
republic.

CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Five subterranean natural gas fields have been
discovered in Egypt's north Port Said, west Abu-Madhi in the Nile
Delta and Baltim.
</P>
<P>
Some 4 million cubic meters of gas will be able to be pumped
from these fields daily, in addition to 7,000 barrels of oil
condensate that can be used in improving the quality of heavy oil
crudes.
</P>
<P>
The gas reserve of these fields are estimated at 35.4 billion
cubic meters and the investments in developing the fields amounted
to 12.5 million U.S. dollars, according to sources of the Egyptian
Petroleum Corporation.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- The Iranian government allowed for the first time the
exploration for oil and gas in the Iranian Kurdistan area, cabinet
spokesman Ata-Allah Mohajerani said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The area, adjacent to the Iraqi Kurdistan region which has
major oil fields, is one of the Iranian less developed areas and
suffers from a high rate of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for Iran to explore for oil and gas in
the west of the country as the Iranian operating oil fields are
mainly in south and southwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
The oil industry was fully nationalized in the 1950s and
continued to be state-controlled after the Islamic Revolution in
1979.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the second major oil producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) at present. It produces up to
3.7 million barrels of oil per day, 2.5 million barrels of which
go for exportation.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- Kuwait and Egypt will sign an agreement aimed at
canceling tariffs late this month under a five-year plan to boost
bilateral trade, Kuwait News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which will be signed in Kuwait, comes within the
framework of a series of free trade zone agreements signed
previously between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Current annual trade volume between Kuwait and Egypt stands at
around 25.88 million U.S. dollars in Egypt's favor.
</P>
<P>
The tariffs will be cut by 50 percent for the first year, and
then they will be reduced gradually in the next few years until a full
exemption is reached.

bilateral ties between the two sisterly countries and the
prevailing situation in the region".
</P>
<P>
"The visit was scheduled upon the request of Gouled to pay a
working visit here and have consultations with Ethiopian senior
government officials," the agency added.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not disclose whether the visit was
related to current border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea
and whether Djibouti will be a third party to mediate the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Former Zairean Generals Granted Asylum in Niger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Three former Zairean
generals, who sought a safe haven in South Africa, were granted
political asylum in Niger, South African Home Affairs Minister
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi told reporters in Cape Town Thursday that the men had
initially sought asylum in Cote d'Ivoire after leaving South
Africa. When this was refused, they had been granted asylum by
Niger.
</P>
<P>
The three generals, Kpama Baramoto, Mudima Mavua and Ngbale
Nzimbi, were arrested by South African police in December on
charges of attempting to enter the country with false documents.
They were later released.
</P>
<P>
The government of Laurent Kabila, president of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, demanded the extradition of the generals who
were accused of plotting to assassinate Kabila.
</P>
<P>
They fled former Zaire when former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko
was ousted by Kabila in May 1997.

<HEADLINE> Britain Lags in European Electronic Commerce Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain is lagging behind its
European partners in adopting the Internet for business, according
to a survey from UK market research company already.
</P>
<P>
The survey, based on interviews with 900 business in the UK,
France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands, has found that
60 percent of companies questioned now have access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
It revealed that Spain is leading Europe in electronic
commerce, with 46 percent of companies linked to the Internet
already conducting business on-line.
</P>
<P>
Spain is followed by France and Germany with the figures of 33
and 20 percent, while the UK, Italy and the Netherlands appear to
be lagging with figures less than 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the UK and the Netherlands are ahead in using the
Internet for recruitment. One in five UK companies with Internet
access is now recruiting new staff through the Internet, far more
than among other European businesses.
</P>
<P>
Nearly a quarter of European companies with Internet access are
already earning revenues, the survey showed, suggesting that
European companies have begun to recognize the importance of
electronic commerce and to close the gap with their U.S.
counterparts.

LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government on Friday
urged its expatriates in the riot-torn Indonesia to leave the

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Visits Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Jawad Anani arrived here Friday for a two-day
visit to discuss bilateral relations and the stalled Middle East
peace process, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Cairo International Airport, Anani told
the news agency that he carries a verbal message from King Hussein
of Jordan to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his country's desire to enhance relations with
Egypt and continue bilateral coordination and consultation.
</P>
<P>
He added that his visit to Egypt comes at a critical time for
the peace process, pointing out the necessity of coordination on
this issue between Jordan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Jordan's reaction to the recent incidents in
the Palestinian areas, Anani said the Jordanian government issued
a statement on Thursday and condemned the bloodshed and violation
of the Islamic holy places in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Eight Palestinians were reportedly killed and 200 others
wounded by Israeli army gunfire in the clashes between the
Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers Thursday in the areas.
</P>
<P>
The clashes broke out as hundreds of thousands of Palestinians
took to the streets to mark the 50th anniversary of Nakba, or
"catastrophe" in Arabic, which refers to the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The violence was resulted from the failure of the Israeli
government to meet its commitments to what were signed in the
framework of the peace process, the Jordanian official said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said "it is a
critical time that requires coordination of positions on the peace
process and on what is happening in the occupied Palestinian land."
</P>
<P>
He added that Anani's visit also aims to enhance cooperation
between the two countries and review bilateral ties, especially
in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Anani said in Amman on Thursday that he will discuss with the
Egyptian side the ways of pushing bilateral cooperation in the
fields of economy, trade, investment, labour, and service to a new
level that can serve as a model for an Arab free trade zone.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian foreign minister will also hold talks during his
visit with the Egyptian leaders on these issues.

<HEADLINE> Ross meets Netanyahu in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Ross, U.S. special envoy
to the Middle East, Friday met with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu here after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright failed to persuade the Israeli leader into accepting a
U.S. proposal on withdrawal by Israeli troops from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said that talks would
continue with Israel because the Clinton administration believed
that "there is sufficient reason for serious work to continue."
</P>
<P>
"I would expect that work to continue this afternoon," Rubin
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is leaving Washington for New York late Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He had two inconclusive meetings Wednesday and Thursday with
Albright over what size Israel's troops should withdraw from the
West Bank. U.S. officials said the gaps still remained.
</P>
<P>
"As for the question of whether we have bridged the gap, I
cannot say that we have and I cannot say that we are on the verge
of putting the peace process back on track," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
He said Albright might talk to Netanyahu by telephone and Ross
might meet him again before he flew back to Israel.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Foreign Affairs
Department said Friday that it was dismayed at reports of Palestinian
deaths in clashes with Israeli troops Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department called on Israelis to withdraw from Palestinian land
as set out in the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
"The existence of Israeli settlers with an accompanying military
presence in Palestinian areas such as Gaza, Bethlehem and Hebron can
only serve to heighten the risk of confrontation," the department said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This in turn emphasizes the need for a speedy Israeli withdrawal
from Palestinian land as envisaged under the Oslo accords."
</P>
<P>
In condemning the deaths and injuries suffered, the statement
called for all concerned to exercise restraint and for calm to
prevail.
</P>
<P>
At least eight Palestinians were killed and more than 200 injured
in the bloodiest fighting between Israelis and Palestinians in nearly
two years.
</P>
<P>
Twenty Israeli soldiers and two Israeli civilians were also injured
following mass Palestinian protests marking the founding of the
Israeli state 50 years ago.

<HEADLINE> China Respects Romanian People's Choices: Li Ruihuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), Friday said China respects the choices of the
Romanian people of their own social system and path of
development.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a meeting with Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu here Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said China believes that the Romanian people will overcome
their difficulties and make great achievements in building their
country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader said full respect for the rights of the
people of other countries to independently choose their social
system and path of development and non-interference in others'
internal affairs are the basic principles strictly abided by the
Chinese government in its international exchanges.
</P>
<P>
He said the people of a country care the most about the destiny
and future of their own country and they know the best of their
own land.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, only the people of the country can determine what
the road the country should take, added Li, who is also a member
of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Forcing a social system and ideology on others will get nowhere
and it may lead to international conflict and confrontation, the
Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
Certainly, on the way of choosing its road of development, a
country may encounter some setbacks and relapses, but eventually
it will find a road that fits the country and is accepted by the
majority of the people, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said during the meeting that Romania pays
importance to developing relations with countries in the
Asia-Pacific region and promoting its relations with China is one
of the priorities in Romanian foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
The president said there's a huge potential in economic and
trade cooperation between Romania and China. He hoped the two
sides can make joint efforts to expand such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the Southeast Asian financial crisis, China's
economy has maintained stable. This is of great significance to
the world economic development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Li, the visiting chairman of the top Chinese
consultative body, met with Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile,
Senate Chairman Petre Roman and Chairman of the Chamber of
Deputies Ion Diaconescu.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here Thursday for a four-day official visit to
Romania, after which he will go to Italy, Spain and France.

<HEADLINE> Ice Cream Market Gets Hot in Beijing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Nestle has become the synonym for instant coffee in
China, Nestle's ice cream has been struggling to gain a bigger
market share over the past couple of years by giving out
refrigerators to retailers, the same as Wall's, and covering
Beijing's double-decker buses with flamboyant ads.
</P>
<P>
With Wall's as its main rival, Nestle slashed the price on
seven kinds of ice cream and popsicles in April following Wall's
price-cutting action the previous month, and its fruit-flavored
Zigzag, whose price was cut the most (from 2.8 to 1.5 yuan), soon
became one of the most marketable.
</P>
<P>
While foreign brands claim the lead positions in Beijing's ice
cream market, the Yili group, a dairy from Inner Mongolia, was a
dark horse in the Beijing market during the past year due to its
successful marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
TV viewers were bombarded by ads for its Bitter Coffee series,
and Yili first targeted Beijing's outskirts with its relatively
low-priced products.
</P>
<P>
After getting a firm footing around Beijing, Yili then
infiltrated the downtown area and finally became one of the most
popular brands in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Yili expects nationwide sales of 900 million yuan and sales
volume of 120,000 tons this year, compared with 600 million yuan
and 80,000 tons last year. Beijing will remain its most important
target market.
</P>
<P>
With the improved living standards and changing lifestyles, the
ice cream market in China is believed to have great potential by
industrial experts, who say the nation's consumption of ice cream
will grow at annual rate of 3-to-6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Great Care Needed for Disabled People, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- All sectors of the society should
take care of and make concerted efforts to help the disabled,
especially those living in poverty, a high-ranking official said
today at a seminar on helping the disabled.
</P>
<P>
Helping the disabled is a work of great political, social, and
economic significance, said Ismail Amat, state councillor and
head of a State Council committee in charge of work for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
He addressed the seminar which was jointly sponsored by the
committee and the Beijing Municipal Government to mark China's
eighth National Day for Aiding the Disabled.
</P>
<P>
A program aimed at helping the disabled escape poverty is being
carried out across the country, he said, adding that it is the
full responsibility of governments at all levels to shoulder the
task of helping the disabled and the drive also needs support from
all sectors of the society.
</P>
<P>
Yang Zhong, deputy head of a State Council committee in charge
of poverty relief, said special assistance will be rendered to the
disabled and publicity work on the poverty-relief drive for the
disabled will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
China's Law on Protecting the Disabled issued in December of
1990 designated the third Sunday of each May as the National Day
for Aiding the Disabled, which is May 17 this year.
</P>
<P>
China has a disabled population of more than 60 million. Owing
to the country's efforts in promoting the welfare of the disabled,
millions of disabled persons have been rehabilitated or have
escaped poverty.
</P>
<P>
Deng Pufang, chairman of the China Disabled Persons'
Federation, Zhou Qiang, secretary of the Secretariat of the
Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, and
Beijing Vice-Mayor Meng Xuenong also delivered speeches at the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality Improves This Week in Major Cities of China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China had no heavy or medium
pollution this week, according to the lastest air quality report
on 33 major cities.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the China Environmental Monitoring
Center (CEMC), says for May 8-14 the atmospheric pollution
index (API) of most of the 33 major cities has decreased.
</P>
<P>
The report gives the API of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen
oxide (NOX) and total suspended particles (TSP).
</P>
<P>
Air quality is listed on five levels by the State Environmental
Protection Administration. An API from 0 to 50 is level I, meaning
excellent air quality; 51 to 100 is level II, or good quality; 101
to 200 is level III, or slight pollution; 201 to 300 is level IV,
or medium pollution; and above 300 is level V, or heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
The report says that Beijing, Guangzhou and Harbin had slight
air pollution, with APIs above 100. The biggest problem in
Guangzhou was NOX, and for Beijing and Harbin it was TSPs.
</P>
<P>
Hefei, Nanchang, Ningbo, Xiamen, Zhuhai and Beihai all had
excellent air quality this week.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 24 cities had good air quality: Shijiazhuang,
Changchun, Zhengzhou, Kunming, Hohhot, Jinnan, Tianjin, Shenyang,
Hangzhou, Chongqing, Guiyang, Qingdao, Yinchuan, Shanghai, Wuhan,
Lianyungang, Dalian, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Changsha, Suzhou, Nanning,
Shantou and Fuzhou.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the CEMC say that the good weather across the
country this week has helped the air quality improve, especially
bringing down the TSP.

BAODING, Northern China, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Zeng Qiliang
confirmed his supremacy again by winning the men's 100-meter
breaststroke title at the Chinese National Swimming Championships
here Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Zeng, Asian record holder and national champion, exploited his
powerful strokes by ousting other rivals to finish first in one
minute 2.52 seconds, ahead of Zhu Yi in 1:03.37 and Wang Xinqiang
in 1:03.74.
</P>
<P>
"I'm so happy to retian the national title, because I only did
some recovery trainings after the World Championships," said Zeng
who ranked third in the last year's rankings in 1:01.66.
</P>
<P>
Zeng made a historic breakthrough for the Chinese men swimmers
in January when he took the silver medal in the 100 meters
breaststroke in 1:01.76 at the World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"But the semifinals does a little disadvantage to our
sprinters," he said, "In my point of view, more games we take more
energy waste."
</P>
<P>
Cui Ziyi, from northeast China Qiqiha'er, became another
14-year-old champion in the women's 200-meter butterfly in 2:12.51
after Ning Bo won the 400-meter medley title on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The result of 2:12.51 is her career best, and she also clocked
previous best of 2:13.33 in yesterday's semifinal," said coach Xu
Yongsheng, "This is her first national title, and I'm proud of
her."
</P>
<P>
The men's 100-meter backstroke title went to Wang Wei in 56.76,
and Fu Yong finished second in 57.58, Tian Bin third in 57.69.
</P>
<P>
Chao Na, the 18-year-old from Beijing, led in the women's 100m
freestyle semifinals in 56.54, while the 400m medley world record
holder Chen Yan finished second in 57.05.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka held a ceremony here
Saturday evening to mark the 25th anniversary of the completion of
the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga said it was with great pleasure that she attended the
ceremony to mark the 25th anniversary of the completion of the
BMICH, a gift from the government and people of China to the
government and people of Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The president pointed out that the BMICH has played a great
role in helping Sri Lanka hold international conferences and
develop foreign economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Chen Defu said that 25 years
ago, with the blessing of the then Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai and
Sri Lankan Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike and through the
joint efforts of engineers and technicians from both China and Sri
Lanka, the BMICH, a present of the Chinese government, came into
being.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the BMICH has since not only symbolized the
1,500-year-old traditional friendship between the Chinese and Sri
Lankan peoples, but also showed the strong friendship and
cooperation between the Chinese and Sri Lankan governments.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has sent the Hangzhou Youth Acrobatic
Troupe here to join Sri Lankan artists in performances to
celebrate the anniversary.

<HEADLINE> Ice Cream Market Gets Hot in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Never having much fancy for ice
cream, Yan Yi was delighted to find so many types of ice cream for
sale in Beijing since she opened a small grocery downtown five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
"There are at least a dozen brands without counting those
lesser-known ones, and those priced between one and two yuan sell
the fastest," said Yan, in her mid-30s, adding that money earned
from selling ice cream and popsicle makes up more than half of
her shop's total turnover from April to October each year.
</P>
<P>
Yan is not alone among Beijing's small shop owners and
peddlers, who have made their living mostly from the city's
booming ice cream industry during the last five years.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's ice cream industry started a period of rapid
expansion in 1993, and 1995-1996 saw a production peak, said Tian
Zongxiang, an official with the Beijing Food Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the production fell slightly to 48,000 tons, while
the total market volume approached 800,000 tons, or every
Beijinger consumed 6.6 kilograms of ice cream and popsicle each
year," said Tian.
</P>
<P>
Wall's, the world's largest ice cream producer based in
Britain, appears to be the leader in this ice cream craze.
</P>
<P>
Since starting its China operation in 1993, Wall's has expanded
its business from Beijing to 60-plus Chinese cities from the
northernmost Heilongjiang Province to the southernmost Hainan
Province.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts rate Wall's as China's No.1 ice cream seller,
and believe its market share in Beijing exceeds 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
They point out that the key to Wall's success is its brand
promotion strategy. Its Paddle Pop, Cornetto and Magnum have
become representatives for ice cream at different prices and of
different tastes.

</P>
<P>
After the stopover here for additional supply of fuel and water
as well as maintenance of the engines, the vessel set sail again
later in the afternoon for the journey of 26,000 nautical miles,
with a targeted time of 80 days. it is scheduled to return to
Gibraltar on July 3.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the vessel would break the current world record
of 83 days, nine hours and 54 minutes on a around-the-globe
journey by any motor-powered vessel, which was set in 1960 by
American submarine USS Trident.
</P>
<P>
"We are now only some three hours behind the schedule. It is
quite satisfactory so far as compared with such a long journey,"
said Phil Hagen, director of the project.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge to the ship and its crew is the
durability of its equipment, he said. And he had to make
well-schemed arrangement for the consumption and supply of fuel
and water on the way.
</P>
<P>
"We can't sail too fast as it would cost too much fuel. And if
we carry too much fuel, it would add to the ship's overall weight
and thus increase the burden on the machines. In that case, the
engines would soon get too hot to keep running," he said. "So we
had to make a choice and strike a balance on various factors."
</P>
<P>
The toughest sections of the journey are yet to come, he said.
The vessel would undergo a real test when sailing from Yokohama,
Japan, to Honolulu later this month and completing the final leg
of the journey, from New York to the starting point of Gibraltar,
in eight days.
</P>
<P>
"There is always something unpredictable on the way, like
weather and status of the machine," Hagen added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing-Toronto International Hospital Under Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's first hospital to
specifically cater to the health and medical needs of foreign
expatriates and some wealthy Chinese people is being constructed at
the Beijing Development Zone, and is scheduled for operation next
spring.
</P>
<P>
The hospital will cost 25 million U.S. dollars. Of that, 11
million U.S. dollars comes from the Canadian side, the Interhealth
Canada (China) Inc.; and 5.5 million U.S. dollars from the Chinese
side, the Beijing Comprehensive Investment Company and the China
National Medical Equipment Import and Export Company, and bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Providing the cost breakdown was John Tegenfeldt, executive
director of the Beijing-Toronto International Hospital here today
in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Tegenfeldt said that within three-to-four years the investment
can be recovered, adding that the speed will be relatively fast.
</P>
<P>
The confidence comes from several surveys which came to the
same conclusion: more and more Chinese people will become wealthy and
have more sophisticated medical and health care needs and will
rise to become the international hospital's major consumers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the hospital also plans to open health
care centers in Shanghai, Chengdu, Tianjin and Dalian, which would
be linked to the Beijing hospital with an integrated telemedicine
system currently under development. The telemedicine line would
also join the hospital to Hamilton Health Sciences and other top
Canadian hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Manley urged Tegenfeldt and the Chinese partners to work
closely to build the project into a model for Sino-Canadian
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Tegenfeldt said that the hospital will be managed like a club
and that life-time memberships will cost 6,000 U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak, Chirac to Issue "Special Statement on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
French President Jacques Chirac are expected to issue a "special
statement" on the Middle East and the peace process during
Mubarak's visit to Paris which starts on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statement will deal with the role Europe and the whole
world should assume for removing the obstacles that hinder the
peace process and for resuming the negotiations on just bases in a
bid to maintain stability in the region, according to the Middle
East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
The statement will outline the two leaders' visualization of the
practical steps which should be taken immediately to spare the
region a whirlpool of violence and to get out of the impasse.
</P>
<P>
MENA said the two leaders are expected to call for adherence to
the U.N. Security Council resolutions, the continuation of the
Madrid formula, especially the land for peace principle,
implementation of the signed agreements and the resumption of
talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks from where they stopped.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, during his three-day state visit to France, will focus
his talks with Chirac on the developments in the Mideast peace
process and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has repeatedly warned against the explosion of violence
as the Mideast was passing through a critical point due to
Israel's rejection of the U.S. initiative to break up the ice on
the Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Clashes which erupted Thursday and Friday in the West Bank and
Gaza between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli forces have led
to the deaths of nine Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Several French ministers have visited Cairo over the past few
months to explore closer cooperation with the Egyptian officials.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rules Out Giving Up Nuclear Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan on Saturday ruled out
the possibility of giving up the nuclear option and vowed that it
would not submit to any brow-beating.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of giving up of our options," Foreign
Secretary Shamshad Ahmed told a press briefing hours after U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott left for Birmingham,
Britain, to brief President Bill Clinton on his talks with
Pakistani leaders.
</P>
<P>
Talbott, at the head of a high-level U.S. delegation, was on a
mission to convince Pakistan not to follow India's suit by
exploding a nuclear device.
</P>
<P>
"Why are you trying to dissuade us from an option which is of
vital national interest for us," Shamshad responded to a Western
journalist who suggested that Islamabad should give up the nuclear
option.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the visit of the U.S. delegation, he said the
United States now has a much better understanding of Pakistan's
position vis-a-vis India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
He said his country has assured Washington that it would not
act in haste and its final decision will be driven by its supreme
national interests and the scope of the threat posed to its
security.
</P>
<P>
"Our response will be well-considered, mature, sober and
comprehensive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad was critical of some big powers' indifferent attitude
toward the timely warnings from Pakistan about India's nuclear
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
"Even the official announcement by the Indian government to
induct nuclear weapons was brushed under the rug," he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, he rejected a major power's
condemnation of and sanctions against India as "irrelevant and
inefficient."
</P>
<P>
"Mere condemnations and sanctions will not make much difference
to India," he said, adding that "a country with much less
resources than India has survived such sanctions."
</P>
<P>
He said India tried to gate-crash into the nuclear club and
the U.N. Security Council as a permanent member under the "smoke
and haze" of its underground nuclear tests. "It is incumbent upon
the whole world to prevent such an unfair development."
</P>
<P>
He called India a violator of the U.N. Charter and Security
Council resolutions, which does not enjoy even the confidence of
regional countries.

<HEADLINE> Somali Reconciliation Meeting Postponed for Third </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 16 (Xinhua)-- Somalia's national reconciliation
conference scheduled to begin in the town of Baidoa Friday has
been postponed for the third time.
</P>
<P>
In a large and exhaustive meeting in Hotel Sahafi of
Mogadishu, the Cairo peace agreement signatories otherwise known
as the National Coordination Committee have agreed upon the
convening of the Baidoa meeting within 90 days beginning from
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a written two-page statement signed by the two cochairmen
of the Cairo peace deal, Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Ali Mahdi
Mohamed, the signatories attributed the continuous postponement
to the difficulties they met in the formation of Mogadishu's
all-inclusive administration and the floods that hindered the
communication in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Baidoa conference had been postponed twice since the Cairo
agreement was signed late December last year for different
reasons including the lack of financial support which has been
preconditioned on settling Mogadishu's crises and establishing
administration there.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Friday night, the faction leaders pointed
out the existence of what they called both internal and external
enemies who oppose to the convening of any reconciliation
conference in general and that of Baidoa in particular.
</P>
<P>
The faction leaders have also pledged in their statement that
Mogadishu's administration will be established within the next
few days and the opening of the air and sea ports will be
assured.
</P>
<P>
Their decisions also include the dispatch of a high-level
delegation consisting of the Cairo conference co-chairmen and
other senior officials from the regions of Bay and Bakol to go on
a tour to those regions ten days after the formation of
Mogadishu's administration so as to pave the way for the
convening of the Baidoa conference.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo peace deal sympathizers, Egypt and the Arab League,
have pledged their full support for the Baidoa conference once
the air and sea ports of Mogadishu are opened for public and
commercial services.
</P>
<P>
There are growing speculations that these successive
postponements for the Baidoa national conference would in the end
encourage morally and materially those against the Cairo peace
deal while on the other hand demoralizing some of the faction
leaders and the Arab League member states who would finance the
conference.
</P>
<P>
By just stating that the Baidoa meeting will be held within 90
days it means that the faction leaders who are so far interested
in the Baidoa conference including Ali Mahdi, Hussein Aidid,
Osman Ali Atto and Mohamed Qanyare, are now themselves less
consistent as shown in their failure to fix an exact date for the
convening of the Baidoa meeting.

<HEADLINE> Pak Asks G-8 to Take Notice of Indian Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif has sent a message to leaders of the Group-8 countries,
drawing their attention to the consequences that would ensue from
India's induction of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Sharif expressed the hope in the message, dated May 13 and
issued by the Foreign Office Saturday, that the G-8 leaders would
recognize and be receptive to Pakistan's legitimate needs for
self-defense. The G-8 leaders are holding a summit in Birmingham,
Britain.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear testing by India of a whole range of weaponry,
"including systems which are Pakistan specific has multiplied
manifold the immediacy and the magnitude of threat to our
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Besides fundamentally altering the precarious strategic
balance, which contributed to the maintenance of a tenuous peace,
this Indian action has raised the possibility of aggressive
military acts against Pakistan," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
"You would certainly agree that overt weaponization by India is
yet another manifestation of the highly irresponsible and reckless
actions taken by India to escalate tensions in the region in
recent weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of these ominous developments which pose an
immediate threat to our security, we cannot be expected to remain
complacent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are once again being asked to exercise restraint at an
extremely critical juncture on matters involving national security
and survival," Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
"I trust that you would recognize and be receptive to
Pakistan's legitimate needs for self-defense," he said.

any country and that the Indian government is committed to
de-nuclearization of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Nordic countries urged India to refrain from any action
that could further deteriorate the situation in the region and to

<P>
PARIS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The president of France's Liberal
Democratic Party (LD), Alain Madelin, Saturday called for a
leading role for his splinter party in the newly-formed right-wing
coalition, the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Addressing 1,500 LD representatives attending a congress in
Paris, Madelin said the LD, from now on, was a co-founder of the
Alliance rather than being affiliated to the Union for French
Democracy (UDF).
</P>
<P>
"More than ever, the LD should exist as it is and affirm its
independence," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Alliance, established on Thursday, consists of the Gaullist
Rally for the Republic (RPR), the UDF and some splinter parties
including the LD, which came into being after the rightwing's
failure in last year's early legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
Interviewed by the daily, Le Figaro, on Saturday, Madelin
proposed, in a ten-point platform, a referendum to reduce
government power, a reduction in state employees.
</P>
<P>
He also called for privatization of state-owned enterprises and
cuts in state spending by one percent every year.
</P>
<P>
The LD platform was the first presented by a French rightwing
party since the legislative elections last year. The RPR and UDF
have so far failed to take any initiatives.

local telecommunications network has more than 27,000 end ports,
providing reliable and spacious platforms for all industries to
develop their own application systems.
</P>
<P>
At present, the local government, the finance, security,
taxation, meteorology and enterprise sectors of the province have
already built their own specialized information networks and
computer-supported management systems on the basis of the public
communication network.
</P>
<P>
The province put into operation a public multi-media
communication network on May 17, 1997. The local multi-media
network was linked with the nationwide one at the end of last
year. It opened the "Fujian Hot Line" Web site today.
</P>
<P>
The next step that it will take is to build a wide-band
multi-media network.
</P>
<P>
It will complete the wide-band platforms in the cities of
Fuzhou, Xiamen and Quanzhou by the end of this year. It will
further expand the wide-band network to cover the whole
province. The expanded network will provide such services as image
transmission, multi-media communication, interactive video and
call-in video.

<HEADLINE> Finnish Businessmen Withdraw from Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- About 130 Finnish businessmen and
their family members have left Indonesia by Finnish airline
flights. The first batch of 30 people arrived in Finland Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Some passengers were quoted by the Finnish News Agency as
saying at the airport that the situation in Jakarta was so
dangerous that there was no reason to postpone their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The report said there were more than 400 Finnish people living
in Indonesia. Most were expatriates with Finnish businesses, and
their family members.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of serious rioting in Jakarta and other
parts of the country, the Finnish Embassy in Indonesia has
maintained close contact with the Finnish airline so that
expatriates could be evacuated to Finland or other safe areas such
as Singapore.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Finnish Foreign Ministry has not enacted a
withdrawal plan, but advised Finns not travel to Indonesia for
fear of mishaps.
</P>
<P>
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari and Foreign Minister Tarja
Halonen have expressed their grave concerns over the situation in
Indonesia and called for dialogue between all parties concerned to
prevent more bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1998, many Finnish businesses have
terminated contracts with their Indonesian counterparts because of
political disturbances in the country.
</P>
<P>
Related insurance provided by the Finnish National Exports
Insurance Bureau in the first four months has dropped from 3.7
billion Finnish marks (681 million U.S. dollars) to two billion
marks, or 368 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Airlines To Operate Osaka-Xiamen Route </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan Air Transportation Co. Ltd
(JAT) signed an agreement Friday with Xiamen Gaoqi International
Airport on ground service, paving the way for its Osaka-Xiamen
route to become operational on July 20.
</P>
<P>
The company's Boeing 767-300 aircraft, capable of accommodating
210 passengers, will depart Xiamen, a port city in east China's
Fujian Province, for the three-hour flight to Osaka three times a
week.
</P>
<P>
JAT's China service began in 1987. It now has 28 shuttle
flights linking major Japanese cities including Tokyo, Osaka and
Fukuoka with Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian, Qingdao and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the Osaka-Xiamen route will facilitate air
traffic to neighboring Jiangxi, Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces.
</P>
<P>
A 1997 governmental accord between China and Japan on air
traffic has allowed the Japanese company to extend its service to
China's inland areas. Routes to Tianjin, Shenyang, Chongqing,
Wuhan and Kunming are expected.
</P>
<P>
JAT, as a leading airlines in Japan, has the largest domestic
share of business. It has a registered capital of 72 billion yen
(540 million U.S. dollars), a workforce of 14,000 and 132 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen airport ranks fourth in China in passenger flow with
an increase of 700,000 passengers in eight years. It welcomed 3.55
million visitors last year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Promises Lebanon Full and Just Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Saturday
promised Lebanese government that it would be committed to helping
seek a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The promise was made in a letter from Washington conveyed by
the U.S. charge d'affairs in Beirut to Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi and Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The letter came less than 24 hours after Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan in New York that Israel is serious in
wanting to leave Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"We affirmed to the secretary-general Israel's decision, after
20 years, to accept U.N. Resolution 425, and to expedite as soon
as we can a withdrawal from Lebanon," Netanyahu told reporters
following his meeting with Annan.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected Israeli conditional withdrawal offer,
which asks Lebanese government to take measures for the safety and
security of Israel's northern border before any pullback can be
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon insisted that the withdrawal should be unconditional in
line with the 1978 U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat here refused to reveal the content of the
letter or provide any further details.
</P>
<P>
The letter came at a time when the peace talks on
Palestinian-Israeli track were deeply stranded.
</P>
<P>
Local observers are eager to see if the letter represented a
change in the U.S. Mideast policy, in which Washington has always
focused peace efforts on the Palestinian-Israeli track.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been occupying a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip
in south Lebanon since 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
villages and towns from lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Clashes broke out frequently between Israeli occupation forces
and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas, who are spearheading
a guerrilla war to try to oust 2,000 Israeli soldiers from south
Lebanon.

WASHINGTON, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>

</P>

rioting that has grown into the hundreds, President Suharto has
rolled back fuel-price increases he imposed only days ago at the
insistence of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
-- A dispute between Russia and the International Monetary Fund
has emerged over how to reduce the nation's budget deficit.
Russia's new Prime Minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, wants to slash
billions of dollars in spending without raising taxes. IMF
officials are urging Kiriyenko to draft a series of tax increases.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>

Chairman Dan Burton under fire for his handling of the campaign
finance investigation, Democratic candidate Bob Kern has high

<HEADLINE> APEC International Economic Forecast Symposium Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation's
(APEC) '98 International Economic Forecast Symposium was
inaugurated today here in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The two-day event will be devoted to studies and discussions on
the economic development tendencies of the Asia-Pacific region,
the negative impact of Southeast Asia's financial turmoil,
technological cooperation among APEC members and problems related
to sustained economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening ceremony, Chinese ambassador to APEC
Wang Yusheng said that Asia's economic vitality is crucial for
global development. As a major regional organization, APEC is
speaking louder in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the financial crisis that plagued Southeast Asian
countries last year has raised new subjects in economic
cooperation among APEC members.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrated financial problems may originate from an
irrational industry mix and a stagnant high- and new-technology
development, which should be appropriate to a country's economic
growth rate, the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, Wang concluded, the only way out for the
crisis-hit countries lies in making structural improvements and
pursuing a higher new-product replacement rate.
</P>
<P>
Vice-minister of China's State Development Planning Commission
Wang Chunsheng gave a speech on "mitigating crisis, improving
cooperation and recovery prosperity" at the morning session.
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting are 30 delegates from 16 APEC
members, APEC officials, officials from the Asia Development Bank,
scholars from Stanford University, the University of Connecticut
and Stockholm Institute of Economy.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Ex-Head of State Warns Against Anarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Excessive corruption, embezzlement
and other forms of fraudulent practices in Nigeria's public
sector pose serious problems to economic development of the
country, according to former head of state General Mohammadu
Buhari.
</P>
<P>
Buhari further averred that social anarchy is imminent unless
the gap between the rich and poor is bridged, the leading
national newspaper This Day reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a lecture Friday in the northern city of Kaduna,
Buhari said that the way corruption and fraud have been perfected
is alarming as "public officials behave as if both divine and
secular laws were put in the statute books as a mere sport."
</P>
<P>
The retired general served as head of the tough military
government that ruled the most populous black African country
between 1983 and 1985 before a bloodless coup forced him to quit
office.
</P>
<P>
Due to his good fame in governance, he was chosen by the
current head of state General Sani Abacha to chair the Petroleum
Trust Fund (PTF) established in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The fund, with estimated resources of billions of U.S. Dollars
accrued from the margin of the rise in the prices of petroleum
products, is specialized in funding projects related to
infrastructure and public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Taking a swipe at the current public sector for its indulgence
in corrupt and fraudulent practices, the PTF chairman lamented
"it has become so bad that it is looking as if there are hardly
any honest people left."
</P>
<P>
In what observers see as the most serious condemnation of the
country's prevalent corruption for some time in Nigeria, Buhari
stated that "nowhere else in the world can one find a society
tolerating the theft of its precious resources in broad daylight
with nothing happening to the thieves."
</P>
<P>
Bemoaning the state of affairs, the former head of state took
exceptions to the notion that "a day in the office, as far as the
general public is concerned, often means eight hours of
converting public resources to private purses."
</P>
<P>
As to why this situation has continued unchallenged, he said
"part of the answer is the grinding poverty which occupies
people's attention and allows them little time for luxury of
concern in bringing about changes."
</P>
<P>
Apart from the deteriorating leadership, tribalism and
sectionalism are also factors to imprison Nigeria, according to
him.
</P>
<P>
In his 31-page paper, described by the official newspaper New
Nigerian as "concise, factual, logical and profound", the former
head of state also touched on the military, politics and
politicians, economy and crisis management.
</P>
<P>
The strong challenge of the leadership was made as all the
country's five political parties adopted General Abacha as their
sole consensus candidate for the August presidential elections
for his capable leadership and contribution to the country.
</P>
<P>
Reportedly having close relations with Abacha, Buhari
completely avoided one subject matter in his paper -- the
speculated transformation of Abacha to civilian president.
</P>
<P>
Whether Abacha should make himself the next president has
become the focus of attention not only in Nigeria but also in
other parts of the world, especially the West.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Accuse Israel over Bloody Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat Saturday held Israeli government responsible for the bloody
clashes Friday, Voice of Arabs Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Eight Palestinians have been killed by Israeli army gunfire and
over 200 injured in clashes which erupted as Palestinians staged a
"million-man march" across the autonomous areas to mark the 50th
anniversary of "al nakba."
</P>
<P>
Al nakba, Arabic for the "catastrophe," refers to the loss of
Palestinian homeland following the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violent clashes broke out at a time when the peace
process was deeply stranded due to Israel's rejection to a
U.S. formula calling a further 13.1 percent Israeli pullback from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ereket accused Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of
trying to capitalize on the political situation in the U.S. to
derail implementation of the Oslo accords, which stipulate that
Israel and the Palestinians hammer out a final peace deal by May
1999.
</P>
<P>
He warned of a "big explosion" in the region unless the
U.S. administration brings pressure to bear on Netanyahu to change
his hardline policy and honor the signed agreements between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright failed once again to achieve a breakthrough to end the
14-month-old impasse in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, also minister of local government in the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA), said Palestinian people are determined
to continue struggle despite 50 years of Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
He said PNA President Yasser Arafat will hold talks with
Jordan's King hussein Saturday, which is aimed at strengthening
coordination and consultation over the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Build Dredger for Mozambique's Beira </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has donated
14.9 million U.S. Dollars toward Mozambique for building a
dredger to dredge the channel in Beira Port.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed here Friday by Mozambican
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Leonardo Simao and
Japanese Ambassador to Mozambique Asao Tuskahara, the dredger
will be built in Japan and handed to Mozambique in 1999, the
Noticias newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With the dredger in use, the channel in Beira Port will be
dredged frequently so that large ships can come in and leave the
port without waiting for the rising tide.
</P>
<P>
The channel in Beira Port has not been dredged since 1990. The
water level of the channel is only five meters deep and full of
sludge. After dredging, the water level will be eight meters
deep.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Simao said, the Japanese donation
will help improve the efficiency of Beira Port, benefiting not
only Mozambique but also the member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
In the view of the Mozambican minister, there has been
significant progress in the cooperation between Mozambique and
Japan in terms of both quantity and quality.
</P>
<P>
Simao pointed out that the cooperation among businesses and
the Japanese private investments have started as a number of
Japanese companies have expressed their interest in investing in
the southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese ambassador said that the project of building the
dredger has great significance in consideration of the importance
of Beira Port's location.
</P>
<P>
He said that as far as Zimbabwe and Malawi are concerned, the
distance is the shortest if their goods are transported through
this port.
</P>
<P>
Now, Beira Port has a handling capacity of about 2.6 million
tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mozambique and Japan have been
cooperating in the rehabilitation of roads and bridges, in
sinking wells in rural areas, and in such fields as agriculture,
fishery, basic education and health care.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 16 (Xinhua) -- At least 1,288 Singaporeans have
returned to Singapore from Jakarta, the riot-ridden capital city
of Indonesia, as of Saturday noon and the Foreign Ministry said
400 more will arrive later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Singapore Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA)
said that it had arranged for Singapore Airlines (SIA) to mount
additional flights to and from Jakarta since Friday and that this
will be continued as long as there is a need.
</P>
<P>
As compared with seven flights normally, the SIA operated 11
flights on Friday and there will be at least 10 flights for
Saturday, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking the same approach in Surabaya. Singaporeans who
want to come home will be able to do so with increased capacity
SIA flights. If MFA assesses that there is a need to mount
additional flights, we will make the arrangements with SIA," it
continued.
</P>
<P>
"Having assessed the situation, we concluded that mounting
additional flights by SIA was the most practical, efficient and
safe means of getting our people home given the fluid situation,"
Verghese Mathews, MFA's director of consular affairs, said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Residents Urged to Cast Their Vote in LegCo Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- An official of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) expressed the hope here
today that more voters would participate in the first Legislative
Council (LegCo) election on May 24.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Michael Suen made the
statement in a letter broadcast in local radio RTHK today.
</P>
<P>
Suen said the election to be held on 24 May is of historical
importance since Legislative Council members are the public's
mouthpiece.
</P>
<P>
"It is clearly provided in Article 68 of the Basic Law that the
method for forming the Legislative Council shall be specified in
the light of the actual situation in the HKSAR and in accordance
with the principle of gradual and orderly progress.
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate aim is the election of all the members of the
Legislative Council by universal suffrage," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law has stated clearly the method for forming the
first, second and the third term of the Legislative Council, he
went on.
</P>
<P>
"From now until 2004, everyone in Hong Kong should actively
participate in all the elections to understand more about the
meaning and significance of the elections, so as to get
well-prepared for the implementation of the provisions in Annex II
of the Basic Law concerning the method for the formation of the
Legislative Council and its voting procedures after 2007," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The official said the Government is "duty-bound to promote
voter registration, prepare for the election, and appeal to the
voters to vote."
</P>
<P>
"We keep reviewing the situation and make improvements, with a
view to enhancing Hong Kong people's participation in public
affairs," he said.
</P>
<P>
There is only one week to go before the polling day, Suen said,
adding while all the candidates are vigorously preparing for the
election, his colleagues responsible for preparing the election
are working round the clock.
</P>
<P>
"All of us have a common goal, that is, to have a fair, open
and honest election. We also hope that more voters will
participate in this historic event," he said.

<HEADLINE> King Hussein: Netanyahu Contradicts Himself </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein here Saturday
criticized Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for
contradicting himself over peace between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with visiting Swiss President
Flavio Cotti, the king said that by saying that that peace between
governments was just peace on paper, Netanyahu should mean that
peace between peoples was real peace; However, what the prime
minister actually did showed is that he respected neither peace
between governments nor peace between peoples.
</P>
<P>
"He contradicts himself," Hussein told Cotti, who is to visit
Israel on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The peace between the Israeli and Palestinian governments was
embodied by the "land for peace" principle, the Oslo accords and
other relevant treaties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and his cabinet showed their disrespect for this
peace by refusing to fully implement the principle and the
agreements, he added.
</P>
<P>
The peace between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples was not
respected by them, either, as Netanyahu's government kept silent
about extremists' recent violence on Islamic holy places, said the
king.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the arson Thursday night of a gate leading
to the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, the third holiest shrine of
Islam.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Israeli government's hardline policy turned
recent peace meetings in London and Washington into nothing, which
also showed that Israel was not willing to respect either type of
peace, according to the king.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli stand constituted a stark contrast with that of
the Palestinians, who have fully accepted a United States
proposal, under which Israel was asked to withdraw from 13.1
percent more of occupied Palestinian lands, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been deadlocked since
last March due to Jewish settlement expansion in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During recent meetings in London and Washington on reviving the
peace process, Israel stuck to its refusal of the U.S. proposal,
citing security needs.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss president discussed with the king ways to revive the
stalled Mideast peace process and bilateral economic ties. He is
scheduled to leave for Israel on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> IBF Slims Entries for Major Badminton Tournaments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Badminton
Federation (IBF) has decided to slim the rapidly expanding size of
major internaitonal tournaments, either sanctioned by the
Federation itself or the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
At the IBF Annual General Meeting (AGM) here on Friday,
badminton's world governing body confirmed that it had accepted
the IOC proposal to cut down the total mumber of players for the
Olympic Games in sydney in 2000. The IOC had proposed to cut the
total entry at the Olympic badminton tournament from 192 in
Atlanta down to 172 at the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
And the IBF came to the agreement that the six of the Sudirman
Cup competitions to be too large to find large enough venues for
hosting the tournament. The regulations for the world mixed team
champpionships were therefore amended to give the IBF Council the
power to restrict the number of entries "if thought to be
necessary".
</P>
<P>
At the AGM held at the Hong Kong Jockey Club on Friday, a few
new Council members were elected, which included Edgar Batalla
Agipay from the Philippines, Robert Leole from Tanzania, Prakash
Padukone from India and Yang Shu'an from China, according to an
IBF news release issued here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Changes were also made to the Laws of Badminton at four-year
intervals. Revised laws were adopted for implementation on August
1 this year, it was decided.
</P>
<P>
The main features of these changes were that setting will only
be permitted (and to three points) at 14 points for doubles and
men's singles, and at 10 points for ladies' singles.
</P>
<P>
A 90-second interval between the first and second games will be
permitted and on-court coaching allowed during that interval, the
IBF ruled.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians clashed again
Saturday with Israeli troops in the West Bank city of Hebron and
East Jerusalem, but no fatal casualties were reported so far.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, which is situated in the south of the West Bank,
hundreds of Palestinians took to the street in the city center
where Jewish settlers are living and clashed with Israeli troops,
according to the Jerusalem-based Palestinian press service JMCC.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians threw stones at the soldiers, who returned
with rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
Confrontations between Palestinians and Israeli security forces
 took place Saturday at Salah Eddine Street of East Jerusalem,
where most of the residents are Arab Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians were asking the Israeli side to release five
Palestinians who were arrested during the Thursday demonstrations
when the confrontations took place.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians held a "Million People March" on Thursday to mark
the 50th anniversary of "al nakba," Arabic for the catastrophe,
which befell upon Palestinians together with the creation of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
About 1 million Palestinians lost their homeland to Israeli
occupation in the first Mideast War in the wake of the founding of
Israel.

At least nine Palestinians were killed Thursday when angry
Palestinians clashed with Israeli forces, leaving another bitter
memory of hatred among the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hong Kong Stock Market Ends Week 5.2% Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's stock market closed
the week's trading 5.2 percent lower, amid mounting concern over
the worsening crisis in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng index shed 521.99 points during the week to
Friday to close at 9,538.39, after losing 4.8 percent in the
previous week.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty over the direction of U.S. interest rates and
rising local interbank rates were also blamed by local brokers for
the continued fall.
</P>
<P>
Investors preferred to stand on the sidelines and daily
turnover remained meager, ranging from the lowest of 3.6 billion
HK dollars (464 million U.S. dollars) on Monday to the highest of
8.3 billion HK dollars on Thursday (1.066 billion U.S. dollars) .
</P>
<P>
This compared with last year's average daily turnover at 15.46
billion HK dollars (1.98 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Hong Kong share prices inched higher in cautious
trading, with the market barometer Hang Seng Index firming 0.35
percent to finish 35.99 points higher at 10,096.37.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the market tumbled 254.86 points or 2.52 percent to
close below the 10,000-point level, as interest rates jacked up
and regional markets weakened. The Hang Seng Index saw
across-the-board decreases in all the four sub-indices.
</P>
<P>
The market suffered more losses on Wednesday when Hong Kong
shares sank 372.22 points or 3.78 percent to 9,469.29, the lowest
level since January 27. Mounting concern over continued turmoil in
Indonesia and a surge in interbank rates hit hard property,
finance and also China's mainland-related stocks.
</P>
<P>
Thursday saw the market recover some of the lost grounds. The
blue-chip index gained 122.66 points, or 1.30 percent, to close at
9,591.95.
</P>
<P>
On the last trading day of the week, the market shed 53.56
points or 0.56 percent to close at 9,538.39 in thin trading.
</P>
<P>
Brokers expected Hong Kong shares to remain volatile amid
Indonesian crisis next week.
</P>
<P>
"Trading will remain volatile with the market focusing on the
developments in Indonesia," said a broker.
</P>
<P>
About 170 people were reported dead after a fire set by rioters
raged a Jakarta supermarket Friday morning. Hundreds of shops and
buildings were looted or burned by rioters in the last few days
when the political unrest escalated.
</P>
<P>
Financial dealers warned that there is a real risk that the
deteriorating situation in Indonesia may trigger a more profound
outflow of international capital from the region and a renewed
round of pressure on the regional financial markets.

<HEADLINE> Denmark to Provide 200 Million Dollars to Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Danish government has decided
to release 200 million U.S. Dollars in aid to Uganda in the next
five years, a senior official of the Danish Foreign Ministry has
said.
</P>
<P>
The money would be used for road repairs, health services,
agriculture and the judiciary, Geert Aagaard Andersen, head of
the Department for east and west Africa in the ministry, said in
a press release issued here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Last year we disbursed 60 million U.S. Dollars to Uganda and
the same level this year,"the visiting Danish official said. "For
the next five years we shall disburse 200 million U.S. Dollars
for projects and programs."
</P>
<P>
This money excludes technical assistance and Danish aid
through multilateral organizations, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Danish government is deeply concerned
over the increase in the number of cases of theft, embezzlement
and mismanagement of funds in the Danish-financed programs.
</P>
<P>
He warned that this poses a threat to the possibilities of
their long-term cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Denmark uses one percent of its gross domestic product as
development assistance to underdeveloped countries and it is the
highest in the world.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Call On U.S. To Clarify Stance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriots have called on the
United States to clarify its stance over Cyprus, Turkish Daily
News reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This request was in response to a statement made by U.S. State
Department spokesman James Rubin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rubin blamed the collapse of U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke's
recent Cyprus mission to the Turkish side, saying "the primary
responsibility lies on the Turkish side."
</P>
<P>
However the Turkish Cypriots stressed that "it is obvious that
overblown accusations cannot bear any fruit."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's May 2-4 mission failed to bring Turkish and Greek
Cypriots back to the negotiating table due to the preconditions
set by Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots demanded recognition of the breakaway
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus ahead of a resumption of
negotiations on "state-to-state" basis, and withdrawal of Cyprus'
application for the European Union membership.
</P>
<P>
Terming these preconditions as unacceptable, Holbrooke said
they made a "meaningful exchange" impossible.
</P>
<P>
But he also accused the EU of failing to treat Cyprus and
Turkey equally on the accession talks. The EU excluded Turkey from
its list of membership candidates.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriots walked out of the peace negotiations last
summer in protest of the EU's decision to begin accession talks
with Cyprus, but not Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated
south and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops landed and took over the northern third of the
island in the wake of an abortive pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is recognized only by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.N has been trying for decades to reunify the island
under a bizonal and bicommunal formula.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister
Syed Hamid Syed Jaafar Albar said Saturday the air force is ready
to fly in more Malaysians from Indonesia if there is a request
from the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Two C-130 transport aircraft were sent by the air force to
Jakarta to bring back Malaysians wishing to return home following
the unrest in the Indonesian capital.
</P>
<P>
"We can bring back those wishing to return. We will cooperate
with the Foreign Ministry, that's why we have sent two C-130
planes today," he told reporters after attending the commissioning

</P>
<P>
On news reports that large numbers of Indonesians were coming
over to Malaysia by sea from Dumai port in Sumatra, the minister

prevent the entry of illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Malaysia Airlines (MAS) which normally uses the

Jakarta-bound flights to the bigger Boeing 747-400 to cope with
the heavy passenger demand from Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
There are heavy reservations from all its destinations in
Indonesia over the next couple of days, according to an MAS
spokesman who however said except for Friday, when MAS added an
extra Airbus flight to and from Jakarta, the airline was operating
on its usual schedules from Indonesia.
</P>

CHONGQING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Historians in southwest China's
Chongqing Municipality have found an album of 150 photos about the

during the Anti-Japanese War (1937-1945).

<HEADLINE> Indian Opposition Parties Flay Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Some leading opposition parties
in India have condemned the government led by Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee for the nuclear tests, saying it was pursuing a
hidden agenda of fundamentalist Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial to be published in its organ "People's
Democracy," the Communist Party of India (Marxism) (CPI-M) said
the nuclear tests were conducted with an intention to divert
people's attention from pressing issues and would whip up an arms
race in the subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
Such a decision could jeopardize the recent advances towards
good neighborly relations, asserted the editorial, adding that
Defense Minister George Fernandes' statements on China, prior to
the tests, were "actually a build up to making the bomb."
</P>
<P>
The move was motivated by concerns other than India's security,
said the CPI-M.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was "obviously guided
by its strident jingoism" to "divert people's attention away from
the fast deteriorating conditions of livelihood and whip up an
arms race in the subcontinent with strong communal overtones,"
said the editorial.
</P>
<P>
"What has transpired within two months since the BJP assumed
power which warrants such a drastic shift in our security
perceptions? This is a question that the BJP has to answer to the
Indian people," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Rashtriya Janata
Dal (RJD) also echoed the same tone on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, some mass organizations staged protests in New
Delhi, castigating the government for conducting the nuclear tests
and appealed to the people not to fall prey to pseudo-nationalism.
</P>
<P>
The Students' Federation of India condemned the government for
backtracking from the policy of nuclear disarmament. It termed the
BJP's decision as deliberate and guided by electoral interests.

policy.

region.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Opposes Any External Interference: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi has said that his government opposes any kind of external
interference with the democratic process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister Friday called on the donors to be honest
and realize the fact that democratic process is itself a process
of consciousness of the local citizens.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, any kind of external interference with the process
is not allowed, the Noticias newspaper Saturday quoted Mocumbi as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican prime minister made this remark after some
donors expressed their concerns over the boycott of some
oppositions.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties boycotted the local elections scheduled
on June 30 on the excuse that there were riggings in the voters
registration at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The United States publicly expressed its disappointment and
suspended its financial support for the Mozambican elections.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) also expressed its worry about the
current situation for the coming local elections. It said that
it will take further measures within days. EU has not suspended
its support for the elections.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mocumbi said that the Mozambican government is
carrying out its responsibilities firmly and frankly.
</P>
<P>
Any donor, if thinking calmly and seriously about the problems
in Mozambique, would have no reason to complain of what the
Mozambican government has done since the democratic process
started, said Mocumbi.
</P>
<P>
In response to the U.S. and EU reactions, Mocumbi said that
they can even make a comparative study between Mozambique and
other African countries.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the boycott of the opposition parties will
jeopardize the national reconciliation in the southern African
country, the Prime Minister gave a no answer.
</P>
<P>
Elections themselves are signs of national reconciliation,
said Mocumbi.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Tanzanian Peasants Threatened by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in
Rufiji District in east Tanzania's Coast Region are facing a
severe shortage of food following devastating floods which washed
away 41,000 hectares of farms early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Regional Commissioner, Prof. Philemon Sarungi, said
most of the hunger-stricken peasants are eating seeds given to
them in January for planting, according to a report by The
Guardian Saturday
</P>
<P>
The regional commissioner, who went to the Prime Minister's
office to report the famine situation Friday, said urgent
measures are needed to save the lives of the starved.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation is so bad that people's health is
tremendously deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The regional authorities will send some 25 tons of
fast-maturing maize seeds to be planted as an urgent measure to
deal with the food deficit, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rufiji is famous for rice production but recent rains have
swept away paddy, maize, cassava, and banana.
</P>
<P>
The famine was contrasted by agricultural harvest in other
areas. Farmers in the Lake Zone regions have expressed worries
that bumper harvest of rice this year have led to a slump of
prices.
</P>
<P>
A kilogram of rice in Mwanza, Shinyanga and Mara regions sells
at 50 to 100 shillings (about 0.15 US dollars) while Dar es
Salaam residents still buy rice at more than 500 shillings a
kilogram.

MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Former Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim, a

his defeat Saturday afternoon to Vice President Joseph Estrada,

According to the latest partial results provided by the

</P>
<P>
The official vote counting is still at the provincial level and
the partial results could not be released until the end of next

Lim was the fourth presidential bet to concede defeat to
Estrada. The others were former Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, former
defense secretary Renato de Villa and former Philippine Charity

<P>
SHENYANG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The Liaohe Oilfield in Liaoning
Province in the northeast, the third largest oil production center
in China, has used two billion US dollars of overseas funds since
the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The overseas investment has been used to finance prospecting,
development and in-depth processing of oil and gas at the
oilfield, said an official with the oilfield.
</P>
<P>
Overseas companies like Shell Exploration (China) Limited of
the Netherlands and Tongli Energy Canada Ltd have been cooperating

China B. V. of the United States has been cooperating with the
Liaohe Oilfield on raising the rate of recovering thick oil.
</P>
<P>
Beckury International Limited based in Hong Kong has spent 1.08
billion yuan in purchasing the right to develop 70 percent of the
Lengjiapu oilfield, a subsidiary of the Liaohe Oilfield. It is
considered China's largest onland oil development project
involving overseas cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the contract signed between the Hong
Kong-based company and the Liaohe Oilfield started on March 1 this
year and all assets will be transferred over to the Liaohe
Oilfield when the cooperation contract expires 25 years later.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Environment Minister Alfeyo
Hambayi has warned of stern action against investors in the
forestry sector involved in deforestation.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi voiced the warning at a Mwekera Forestry College
graduation ceremony held Friday in Kitwe, about 400 kms north of
the capital city of Lusaka, Zambia Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hambayi also warned the local community not to indulge in
deforestation which he said will create a lot of environmental
problems in the country if not checked.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to warn public officers, private individuals and
investors in the forestry sector who are involved in illegal acts
that they would be dealt with ruthlessly," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The environment ministry is preparing a national forestry
policy and a forestry bill to curb the problem of deforestation
and ensure that the forests benefit the local community,
according to Hambayi.
</P>
<P>
He challenged the forestry college graduates to implement the
skills they have acquired and sensitize the communities to the
dangers of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of Zambia's territory is covered by forests, but
the deforestation is intensifying since the country has not
worked out efficient measures of protection up till now.

MANILA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Vice President Joseph

<P>
According to the latest partial unofficial results released
here, Estrada, candidate of Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino
(Lammp) (Fight of Patriotic Filipino Masses), has won 6,263,179

</P>
<P>
De Venecia is the standard bearer of the ruling Lakas-NUCD

<HEADLINE> Draft Treaty Launched for E. African Regional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A draft treaty for the
establishment of the East African Community has been published in
the capitals of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania to enable the
participation of people in the treaty making process.
</P>
<P>
Launching the treaty, Nicholas Biwott, East African and
Regional Cooperation Minister, said Friday that the move was
unprecedented in the history of treaty making, according to local
press reports Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The formation of a joint legislative assembly, supreme court,
defense and military pact, and a monetary union for the three
member states are among the highlights of the draft treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister said that the draft treaty would be
debated for three months starting from May 20 before the final
copy would be ratified next November by the presidents of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Gradually, Biwott said, there will be a common market for the
East African Community following the formation of a monetary
union and ultimately a political federation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that in order to liberalize trade within the region,
a common market would be established for a free movement of goods
and services.
</P>
<P>
Custom duties and other charges imposed upon imports of
locally manufactured goods will be gradually removed and a common
external tariff will be maintained in respect of imported goods
from elsewhere, he added.
</P>
<P>
Biwott stated that the treaty is attempting to revive common
services and economic integration in the region such as
railroads, harbors, posts and telecommunication services, and
income tax services.
</P>
<P>
According to the treaty, each of the three member states shall
elect nine members of its National Assembly to form the regional
legislative assembly.

<HEADLINE> UTC to Set Up 30 Joint Ventures in China By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- George David, chairman of United
Technologies Corp. (UTC) of the United States, promised two years
ago to then-Chinese Premier Li Peng that UTC would set up 30 joint
ventures in China by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We will keep our promise to the premier," David said. His
confidence came from the rapid development of UTC in China in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
Since Otis Elevator Company, a UTC subsidiary, set up a joint
venture in 1984, UTC has established 23 joint ventures in China
with an investment of 300 million US dollars. Another nine
cooperative projects are being negotiated.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 Chinese have been hired for these projects in the
fields of aircraft engines, air conditioning, elevators,
automotive components and industrial gas turbines.
</P>
<P>
David told the Chinese media in an interview here recently
that, although UTC's investment in China is not as high as that of
other capital-intensive foreign companies, UTC has transferred
many advanced technologies to China.
</P>
<P>
These technologies have helped products of UTC's China joint
ventures take over a large market share in China.
</P>
<P>
UTC also is collaborating with Chinese scientists and engineers
on advanced technologies to support the UTC-China joint ventures'
manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
David admitted that the controls on high-tech exports to China
imposed by the United States have adversely affected UTC's
development in China, and said that his company has asked the US
government to change its policy.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the US government abolished the policy, UTC
would transfer its most advanced technology to China.
</P>
<P>
David, who has visited China more than 20 times, said that
China's investment environment has improved significantly during
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
UTC's affiliates include Pratt &AMP; Whitney, Carrier, Otis,
Sikorsky and Hamilton Standard.

In an interview published Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister and

education were also on top of the agenda during the visit, he said.

Vietnam and Russia closer in restoring and broadening their
traditional markets in each other's country.
</P>
<P>

to be optimistic about the prospect of their trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade, about 300 million U.S. dollars in 1997,
would be increased by 10 times in the coming years as expected by
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, he said.
</P>
<P>
Methods of payment is one of the most difficult problems in
expanding the trade ties, Cam noted, adding that he discussed with
Russian leaders on possible solutions to the problems.
</P>
<P>
Cam and his Russian counterpart also exchanged views on
regional and international issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> European Sports Ministers Meeting Ends in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 15 (Xinhua) -- European sports ministers said here
Friday that strong and ethical values, both ancient and modern,
were the keys to tackling the problems and challenges of the
sports world in the run-up to the 21st Century.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here after the closing session of the
15th Informal Meeting of European Sports Ministers, said it was
agreed that "traditional sporting ideals should be resurrected."
</P>
<P>
It explained that this would help "both to counter the
dominance of money in today's sports and to make the most of the
power of sport to create social bonds."
</P>
<P>
It added "these values include tolerance, fair play and the
contribution sport can make to building peace, including the ideal
of the Olympic truce during major sporting events."
</P>
<P>
The meeting also emphasised the need for new laws and ethical
decisions on specifically modern sports problems, including
violence, doping, ever-increasing commercialization and the impact
of new media technologies.
</P>
<P>
It unanimously endorsed the important role of sport in creating
social cohesion, as set out in the action plan of the Council of
Europe (CoE)'s Second Summit of Heads of State and Government.
</P>
<P>
It also agreed future priorities for further work in this field
and that the voluntary sector had an important role to play, the
press release said.
</P>
<P>
Head of Sport Division of CoE Gorege Walker said at a press
conference that there was a very clear demonstration of
willingness by the ministers of countries represented here to
promote sports development.
</P>
<P>
A CoE Committee for Sports Development will meet next month and
discuss the unanimous suggestions, the conclusions and the ideas
that have been put forward here, the official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cypriot Education and Culture Minister
Lykourgos Kappas, Greek Alternate Foreign Minister George
Papandreou sent a message to the meeting, suggesting that during
the 2004 Athens Olympics a truce should be adopted like the one
during the ancient Olympics in Greece.
</P>
<P>
European sports ministers welcomed the proposal, as well as the
initiative of the International Olympic Committee to revive the
ideal of Olympic truce as a basic and effective measure for world
peace and understanding, Kappas said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting was attended by ministers and top officials
from 47 European countries. Israel and a number of
non-governmental organization also took part as observers.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Go Ahead with Pledged Loan to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Saturday promised to
go ahead with its commitment to provide the 250 million U.S.
dollars loan to Indonesia despite the social unrest in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"We give it to a nation. Obviously, whoever succeeds the
government will have obligations as much as they have obligations
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international
bodies," Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told reporters
at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport upon his return from an
eight-day visit to Egypt and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The 250 million U.S. dollars loan Malaysia pledged is given to
Indonesia while the latter awaits the IMF bailout package to be
released to revive its economy.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that when a country borrows money and there are
changes in the government, it would not mean that the loan would
be written off.
</P>
<P>
To a question on whether the IMF is to be blamed for what has
happened in Indonesia, Mahathir said "IMF is not sensitive to the
social cost of economic restructuring...as if the economy and
society have got no relation whatsoever."
</P>
<P>
To another question on whether the IMF should relax its tight
conditions before releasing funds to Indonesia, he said the
organization should see that when it imposed conditions which
stifled the economy, the people would suffer.
</P>
<P>
He said in a society which depends on subsidy, the people would
need more subsidies when the value of their currency depreciated.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the situation in Indonesia was regretful and
added that the disgruntled parties should sit down and resolve
their differences.

<HEADLINE> Three Countries Set to Close Down Dhaka Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Three countries have set to close
down their resident missions in Dhaka shortly mainly due to their
"budgetary constraints", an English daily here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The three countries are Belgium, Brazil and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
The embassies of Brazil and Hungary had already stopped normal
operations while the Belgian embassy was preparing to close down
by the end of this month, The Daily Star quoted diplomatic sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
All the three countries had cited "budgetary constraints" as
the main reason for their decision to wind up their diplomatic
missions in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
This is for the first time that three countries are closing
down their resident missions in Bangladesh, the daily said, adding
that with these three missions closed down, the number of foreign
resident missions in this South Asian country will come down to
46.
</P>
<P>
Winding up of the three missions might seriously affect
Bangladesh's access to these countries, hampering both trade and
diplomacy in the long term, diplomatic observers predicted.

<HEADLINE> Thailand makes Plan to Address Plight of Jobless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Labor and Social Welfare
Ministry has worked out a plan which aims to curb the problems
stemming from unemployment, the Nation quoted Saturday a senior
ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Phan Chantrapan, permanent secretary of the ministry, said the
difficulties confronted by the 1.2 million unemployed people in
Thailand will be alleviated with the help from the ministry's
five-part plan.
</P>
<P>
Under the first part of the plan, cash from the social security
fund will be used to buy the bond of the Medium-sized Industry
Financial Corporation of Thailand (MIFCT).
</P>
<P>
The ministry aims to help the MIFCT because it has been
extending loans to small scale business, helping save the jobs of
some workers at the risk of redundancy.
</P>
<P>
Second, adjustments will be made to regulations to allow the
maximum number of business start-up loans by the public welfare
department to increase.
</P>
<P>
Third, funds will be set aside to support about 350,000 people
for employment in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth part of the plan, financial assistance will be
available to workers made redundant without compensation from
their employers.
</P>
<P>
The last part of the plan said that the ministry will organize
on-the-job training in line with the new industry structure
designed to cope with skill needs when the economy begins to
recover.

<HEADLINE> Postmaster Foresees More Open Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- China's postal service is looking
for opportunities to introduce foreign expertise and investment in
this government-controlled sector, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"We are preparing for this (the opening), though there is no
timetable as yet," the newspaper quoted Postmaster General Liu
Liqing as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liu, director of the State Postal Bureau (SPB), said that the
newly set up bureau is negotiating with the United States and
other countries on the mutual opening of postal markets.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of SPB marked the ending of 40 years of joint
administration of the postal and telecommunications sectors by the
government.
</P>
<P>
The independent SPB is looking for opportunities to introduce
foreign capital, technology and management experience to modernize
the country's postal network, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, SPB is considering holding high-level
investment promotions abroad.
</P>
<P>
He named a number of huge infrastructure projects for possible
foreign investment, including express mail service (EMS) joint
ventures and a 500-million-US-dollar nationwide postal business
computer network.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that the French Government proposed to
provide tens of millions of US dollars of loans to help extend
automatic postal sorting to 63 Chinese cities by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Government also offered to grant China 12 million US
dollars to buy 200 large postal transport vehicles.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand has already signed an agreement with China to send
a panel of management experts to local postal services in north
China's Hebei Province.

<HEADLINE> Riots, Looting Worsen Indonesia's Economy: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The wide-spread riots and looting
in Indonesia's capital city of Jakarta over the past few days may
further worsen the country's already weakened economy, a senior
official said.
</P>
<P>
"The action outside the pro-reform movement has really harmed
us," Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartsasmita said here Friday night after returning from
a visit to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, a further plunge in the rupiah would
certainly hurt the welfare of ordinary people because it would
make prices of basic commodities more expensive since their
production still required imported materials, the daily newspaper
Jakarta Post reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
From Wednesday afternoon to Thursday evening, Jakarta and
nearby towns were spooked by riots and looting which resulted in
the burning of many buildings and brought business operation to a
virtual standstill.
</P>
<P>
Official TV Indonesia and Antara News Agency reported that
hundreds of people were killed or wounded as well as hundreds of
shops, buildings, cars were destroyed during the rioting.
</P>
<P>
Kartsasmita said foreign investors had postponed their
investment plans in the country as a result of the riots.
</P>
<P>
He said that the distribution of basic needs had been badly hit
by the riots in Jakarta, the government would provide a total of
125,000 packages of basic commodities on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope stores and markets which did not get burned can start
doing business again," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Official Foreign Reserves Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's official foreign
reserves as of the end of April stood at 29.5 billion U.S.
dollars, up 900 million dollars from April 16, according to
figures released by the Thai Central Bank available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the International Monetary Fund agreement, the Central
Bank must maintain gross official foreign reserves of 23-25
billion dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Suchada Kirakul, the central bank's deputy director of economic
research, was quoted Saturday by the Bangkok Post as saying that
the increase of official foreign reserves came from foreign direct
investment and the purchase of new shares issued by Thai companies
and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Another factor driving up reserves was the purchase of baht to
settle currency swap obligations built up in speculative attacks
last year that forced the bank to abandon a pegged exchange rate
mechanism on July 2, 1997.

<HEADLINE> Air China Seeks Fare Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- The passenger capacity rate of Air
China's Shanghai-Beijing route is 94 percent on Sunday and 80
percent on Tuesday compared with 30 percent before a restriction
on air-fare discount rate took effect early this month.
</P>
<P>
Officials from this flag carrier of China were quoted by
today's China Daily as saying that the restrictions help
standardize the travel agency market and are in the interest of
all airlines.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an order late
April that tickets on domestic routes may be sold at no more than
a 20 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
As to the first quarter of this year, China's civil aviation
industry, including Air China, suffered financial losses. One of
the reasons, attributed by Air China Vice-President Fu Baoxin, is
that, in the domestic market, the number of available seats has
been slightly higher than demand, which increased slowly in the
first three months.
</P>
<P>
Some airlines raced to discount fares to attract more
passengers and some agencies lowered prices to sell more
tickets. While, the big discounts didn't find larger sales but
resulted in losses for every airline, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the Asian financial crisis has also
contributed to the losses in many Chinese airlines, especially
those with a concentration on international routes.
</P>
<P>
Both the number of passengers and the amount of cargo on Air
China's previously profitable routes to Japan and South Korea have
decreased substantially since the latter half of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The company is working on ways to improve services to lure more
passengers. It signed an agreement with Northwest Airlines of the
United States in New York on Tuesday to introduce a code-sharing
service. Fu said, "Combining airline services is a good trend."

ROME, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
summoned the Indian ambassador for a dressing down after the
second round of Indian nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Dini also told a cabinet meeting on Friday that Italy
reiterated its "strong condemnation" of the tests this week,
saying they ran against the trend of growing peace and security in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said after the meeting that his ministry
summoned Indian Ambassador Fabian Pranchu and expressed the deep
concern in the Italian government and political and media circles
following India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
The tests went against the international trend of nuclear
disarmament and efforts to promote a global nuclear test ban, said
Dini.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government urged New Delhi to reconsider its
security policy in the face of unanimous protests worldwide over
the tests.
</P>
<P>
Dini added that officials of his ministry also met diplomats
from the Pakistan Embassy in Rome and asked the Pakistani
authorities to take a responsible and a self-controlled attitude
toward India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Italian Green Party Senator Athos De Luca on Friday
asked Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Foreign Minister Dini to
recall the Italian ambassador in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
De Luca also gave the Indian embassy in Rome a joint letter
signed by Green Party senators, which expressed grave concern over
the tests.
</P>
<P>
India detonated three underground nuclear devices on Monday and
two more on Wednesday, defying widespread criticism from the
international community.

JAKARTA, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank, Bank
Indonesia, had halted all bank-clearing activities, including
foreign exchange transactions, a statement issued by the bank

banks to participate in clearing, therefore it has decided that

The action effectively freezes local trading in the rupiah
which crashed through 11,000 to the U.S. dollar on Thursday and
was quoted at 10,300 to 11,300 in Singapore Friday.

BEIJING, May 16 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Beijing's Temple of
Heaven Park, one of the main tourist attractions in the Chinese
capital, can now get guided services in their own languages or
dialect.
</P>
<P>
The new service, called recorder guides, is actually recordings
in English, French, German, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Spanish,
and Cantonese. They are provided to visitors who do not understand
Mandarin.
</P>
<P>
The script for the recorder guides, written by specialists on
the Temple of Heaven, covers a wide range of information on the
temple based on historical records, interwined with anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
The recordings were made by announcers of different languages
at China Radio International, China's sole multi-language radio
station.
</P>
<P>
Built in 1420, the Temple of Heaven was a site for ancient
emperors to worship the heavens. Occupying an area of 273
hectares, it is four times the size of the Forbidden City, and
consists of five building complexes. The temple became a park in
1918.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has applied to the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to list the
Temple of Heaven as a world heritage site.
</P>
<P>
About 10 million domestic and overseas tourists come to the
park each year.

<HEADLINE> ADB Loan Helps Clear Air in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 16 (Xinhua) -- An environmental protection project
financed by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) has kicked off in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province to clean up the heavily
polluted air.
</P>
<P>
The project, using ADB's loan of 156 million US dollars and
domestically-raised fund worth 146 million US dollars, expects to
update technologies and equipment of heating systems and power
plants and install facilities to pipe in natural gas to Xi'an,
Xianyang and Tongchuan, three major cities in the province.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi's air quality has been deteriorating over recent years
due to increased use of coal by large enterprises and
households. Acid rain, coal dust and other air pollutants have
caused damages to the cities' buildings, public utilities,
cultural relics, and farm crops, forests, and lakes, and have
become a hazard to people's health.
</P>
<P>
When the environmental project is completed in 2002, the
province will be able to cut coal use by 818,000 tons annually,
which will reduce the amount of TSP (total suspended particles) by
110,000 tons and sulphur dioxide by 16,400 tons, local sources
said.

<HEADLINE> Year 2000 Problem Comes on Top of Agenda: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 16 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Hong Kong official
in charge of information technology Friday called on the community
to pay serious attention to the year 2000 problem and to give top
priority to its solution.
</P>
<P>
K. C. Kwong, secretary for information technology and
broadcasting, said at the anniversary dinner of the British
Computer Society (Hong Kong Section) here: "This millennium
problem has an immutable deadline and will arrive in less than 600
days,"
</P>
<P>
"We need to raise awareness at all levels within our community
and particularly among our business people," said the official,
who urged managers to put the resolution of the problem on the top
of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
The year 2000 problem is commonly known as the "millennium
bug," which is potentially disastrous if not removed from the
sophisticated web of computer systems by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up a high-level inter-departmental
steering committee on year 2000 compliance. "Over 50 percent of
our existing computers are already confirmed to be year
2000-compliant," said Kwong. "We are now working on the remainder
and expect to achieve compliance well within 1999."
</P>
<P>
He noted that good progress has been made in the private
sector, especially in the financial service area. Over 90 percent
of the banking institutions and 70 percent of the insurers are
expected to solve the problem by the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says Israel Wants to Withdraw From Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here Friday that he reaffirmed to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan Israel's decision to withdraw its
forces from Southern Lebanon "as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after he met with Annan at the Latter's
office here, Netanyahu said Israel wants to accept U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425 adopted 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.N. wants to take up this decision, then by all means
Israel would obviously respond positively," he said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution adopted on March 19, 1978 calls for Israel's
withdrawal from a so-called "security zone" captured by Israel to
prevent guerrilla attacks against northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Despite his assertion that the withdrawal has no conditions,
Netanyahu emphasized to Annan the need for Lebanon to take
measures ensuring peace and security in Southern Lebanon after
Israel's pullback, a U.N. official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has withheld the position since it unveiled in early
April its decision to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Both Lebanon and Syria have rejected the conditions. Syria
wants to link the withdrawal with the return to Syria of the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the U.N. role in the transition of the territory
back to Lebanon, the U.N. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said the U.N. secretary-general has set up an internal
working group "to look at what the role would be."
</P>
<P>
It is too early to define the role before any broad political
agreement would be reached between the concerned parties, he
added.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose broadly
Friday as traders turned to the U.S. currency again.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 134.52
Japanese yen, up from 133.73 yen late Thursday. The dollar also
bought 1.7847 German marks, up from 1.7776 marks.
</P>
<P>
Currency traders said they were pleased that the economic
summit in England had not committed publicly to helping Japan
intervene to prop up the yen, something that would weaken the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
But there also was uncertainty heading into the weekend as
meetings continued among the leaders of the United States,
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday: 1.4860 Swiss francs, up from 1.4804; 5.9835 French

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls India's Nuclear State Claim "Deplorable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday called
India's claim to the status of "nuclear weapons state" a
"deplorable step," which could isolate itself from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said earlier in an
interview with the weekly magazine India Today that India had "the
capacity for a big bomb" and so had joined the club of nuclear
weapons states.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said, "We regard
this action as another deplorable step that further escalates an
already unfortunate situation.
</P>
<P>
"We hope India refrains from taking any further steps to
further isolate itself from the international community."
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the nuclear weapons states were defined by the
Non-Proliferation Treaty as those countries that had detonated
nuclear devices by 1968. He added that only an amendment to the
treaty could change the definition.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not suggesting we would even consider it. I'm just simply
pointing out the legal situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said India's nuclear tests this week could not win itself
a quick seat in the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard talks of India becoming a permanent member of the
Security Council.... I believe Secretary (of State Madeleine)
Albright's comment was that she didn't regard that as very likely
given the current circumstance," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If they think they've helped themselves move to a status that
will permit them to be a permanent member of the Security Council,
they should think again," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said India's chances were not helped "because Germany and
Japan, two countries that we have supported for permanent
standing, unlike India, of the Non-Proliferation Treaty."
</P>
<P>
With regard to Pakistan's possible nuclear tests, Rubin said
the United States was worried about its response with its own
testing to India's.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. diplomatic mission led by Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott had talks with the Pakistani government in
Islamabad Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We made very, very clear to them the seriously negative
consequences that would encue from testing and the fact that they
would be far, far better off if they chose the diplomatic road,
the high road, the road of the rest of the world," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"But we believe that testing is a live possibility. We are very
aware of the political pressures that exist in Pakistan. But we
hope that... the government analyzes the situation and concludes
that not going forward with the testing program will redound to
the advantage of Pakistan," he added.

Indonesia as the situation there is further deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The evacuation plans were made after officials urged most
Americans to depart Indonesia as soon as possible and ordered U.S.
government employees deemed nonessential to leave as well.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Tries to Stop Arms Sale to Iran Via Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department said
Friday that it is trying to stop arms dealers using Canada as a
conduit for U.S.-made weapons and military parts bound for Iran in
violation of a trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
"The State Department has been working diligently with law
enforcement agencies to shut down diversion networks with
significant success," State Department spokesman James Rubin said
at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Rubin did not say how much illicit trade had come to light, but
he cited the recent indictment in the U.S. of two Iranian-born men
living in Canada for trying to divert parts of Hawk
surface-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported Friday that a significant portion
of the American-made weapons and parts that Iran buys illicitly
move through Canada, taking advantage of regulatory loopholes and
the Canadian government's decision not to support the American
embargo.
</P>
<P>
Rubin, explaining the loophole, said the international traffic
and arms regulations for the U.S. defense trade do not require
licensing for certain defense exports for Canada.
</P>
<P>
"This exemption reflects the largely open borders that exist
between the two countries for trade purposes," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The (State) department is considering options that would
narrow this international traffic and arms regulations exemption
so as to better support the law enforcement efforts already
undertaken," he said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper described several similar Iranian arms deals and
added that Iran was not the only country to receive U.S.-produced
military equipment shipped through Canada.
</P>
<P>
"It's not our embargo," the newspaper quoted Lynda Watson,
director of the export controls division in the Canadian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade as saying.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Supply Stands at 4,254 Tons in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The total world gold supply amounted
to a record 4,254 tons last year, but the big increase in gold
supply is unlikely to be repeated this year, the Financial Times
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Citing a latest report by the London-based Gold Fields Mineral
Services consultancy, the newspaper said that of the 4,254 tons of
total gold supply last year, central bank sales, producer hedging
and selling by speculating investment funds accounted for 1,179
tons, which more than doubled the amount recorded in the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The record supply, together with Asia's fall in demand due to
the economic crisis in the second half of last year, pushed the
price down to its lowest for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The report said that central bank net sales contributed 406
tons to supply, compared with 275 tons in 1996, and it forecast
that central banks would continue selling this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, forward sales by producers added 329 tons to supply
last year, up from 30 tons in the previous year, while option
hedging contributed 184 tons, up from 101 tons.
</P>
<P>
Newly produced gold supply increased to a record 2,464 tons
last year, compared with 2,357 tons in 1996, and was forecast to
fall this year.
</P>
<P>
The consultancy predicted that gold price this year will still
be under pressure as the full impact of the Asian economic crisis
is still to be felt, and the low oil prices will hit gold demand
in the Middle East region.
</P>
<P>
The booming world stock markets will also be bad for the gold
price, the report added.

<HEADLINE> More Bulletproof Vests for Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
sign a law to help local police departments buy more bulletproof
vests, Vice President Al Gore told police and relatives of slain
officers Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We must protect those who protect us," Gore said at a memorial
service for fallen police officers here.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Friday approved spending 25 million dollars for
vests for police departments where the gear is scarce or
nonexistent. Half the money will go to jurisdictions with fewer
than 100,000 people. The House approved the same legislation
earlier in the week. Local police must match the grants dollar for
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Vests are too expensive for many of the smallest police
departments, police groups said. A study last year by the National
Association of Chiefs of Police concluded that 10 percent of the
nation's forces are without vests, leaving about 60,000 officers
unprotected.
</P>
<P>
Many people are startled to learn that in poorer departments,
officers often must buy their own vests, Gore said. He cited
figures showing that 43 percent of officers have vests in such
departments, while 96 percent of officers have vests in
departments where the gear is supplied.
</P>
<P>
Body armor can be highly effective but is far from foolproof.
Preliminary FBI figures showed 27 officers slain last year were
wearing bulletproof vests.
</P>
<P>
But the vests have saved about 2,000 officers' lives since they
have been in wide use over the past decade, said Gerald S.
Arenberg, spokesman for the National Association of Chiefs of
Police.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
also spoke.
</P>
<P>
Part of the memorial service was dedicated to the 171 police
officers the national Fraternal Order of Police said were killed
on duty last year. Their names will be added to the granite Law
Enforcement Officers Memorial on the Mall.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Urges Debt Relief by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Carol Bellamy, executive
director of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), has
expressed strong support for efforts aimed at removing the debt
burden from the poorest nations, mostly in Africa, by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The current summit of eight industrialized nations should
revise the scope and timetable of the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative (HIPC), she said in a statement released by
UNICEF here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The HIPC, adopted in 1996 by the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank, was designed to bring an end to the debt
crisis in the least developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Despite some benefits to a tiny number of countries, the most
debt-burdened states cannot await the three to six years that the
HIPC process requires, Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
She said the resources devoted to debt reduction under the HIPC
should rise from the presently anticipated figures of
approximately 7.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Africa's debt totals 235 billion dollars, while "the 7.5
billion dollars represent less than 4 percent of the total," she
noted.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks End Week Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 15 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe ended
the week mixed Friday, with London and Paris extending Thursday's
losses to close down and Frankfurt finishing higher.
</P>
<P>
Britain's FTSE-100 index of leading shares closed down 0.52
percent or 30.7 points at 5,917.8, also a drop of 54.5 points from
last week, depressed by worries over the near-term direction of
world interest rates and political unrest in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that weak futures trade, a moderate rise in
sterling, and Asian jitters also sent the market lower.
</P>
<P>
But a partial recovery from early losses on Wall Street took
London shares off their lows by the close.
</P>
<P>
Banks performed poorly, with sellers sweeping through Bank of
England, Woolwich and Lloyds TSB.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, French shares also ended the session lower
as worries over the political and economic situation in Indonesia
and a dull Wall Street weighed on market sentiment, with the
CAC-40 index closing down 21.75 points or 0.54 percent at
3,990.23, but a rise of 83.87 since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, in Frankfurt, the DAX-30 index ended the week up 31.92
points or 0.60 percent at 5,393.14 as the market was boosted by
the rise of the dollar above 1.78 marks and staged a modest rally
at the end of a sluggish session.
</P>
<P>
But traders expected little new impulses amid a lack of
market-making news.

<HEADLINE> G-7 leaders Issue Statement on World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, May 15 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of the G-7 countries
and the president of the European Union commission discussed the
world economic and financial situation, and the challenges they
face in strengthening the global financial system here Friday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after an informal G-7 leaders' meeting
Friday afternoon said that they "will work together to achieve
sustained non-inflationary growth."
</P>
<P>
"Such growth and stability are more important than ever, not
only for our own economies, but also for other economies in the
world, particularly the recovering economies in Asia," it said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders strongly welcomed the Japanese government's
substantial economic policy package announced last month and the
progress toward implementation to revive confidence and to achieve
long-lasting domestic demand-led growth.
</P>
<P>
Japan explained its intention to strengthen the financial
system by resolving decisively non-performing asset problems and
by other means, and stressed the importance of promoting
structural reforms, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the decisions taken on May 2 on the establishment of
European monetary union (EMU), the leaders looked forward to a
successful EMU which contributes to the stability of the
international monetary system.
</P>
<P>
On the global financial system, the statement said, "It has the
power to bring immense economic benefits to all countries and
people."
</P>
<P>
But the Asian financial crisis has revealed that there are
potential weaknesses and vulnerabilities in the global financial
sysytem; therefore, urgent steps are needed to be taken to
strengthen the global financial system, it added.
</P>
<P>
The leaders also endorsed the report by their finance ministers
on ways to strengthen the global financial architecture, on which
they attached particular importance to:
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing transparency;
</P>
<P>
-- Helping countries throughout the world prepare for global
capital flows;
</P>
<P>
-- Ensuring that the private sector takes full responsibility
for its own decisions in order to reduce moral hazard.
</P>
<P>
They also asked their finance ministers to take forward these
ideas in cooperation and discussion with emerging market and other
countries, with the international financial institutions and the
private sector.
