IN HIS FINEST HOUR, YZERMAN WINS BIG ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the course of the Stanley Cup finals,
Brendan Shanahan said that hockey teams _ like pets with their
owners _ begin to resemble their leader over time.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, then the strange and wonderful relationship
between Steve Yzerman and the Detroit Red Wings came full circle on
Tuesday night. The Red Wings, who were regarded as the classic
can't-win-the-big-one team through the early 1990s, won their
second consecutive Stanley Cup on Tuesday night, finishing a
four-game sweep of the Washington Capitals with a 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   And Yzerman, who was once regarded as the classic great player
who can't win the big one, is now viewed as the National Hockey
League's most respected leader after winning the Conn Smythe trophy
as the playoffs' most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, who was named captain of the rebuilding Red Wings as a
21-year-old in the 1986-87 season, captured the first major trophy
of his starry 15-season NHL career when he was handed the Smythe
trophy on Tuesday night after a dominating and defining playoff
performance. Yzerman led all playoff scorers with 24 points on 6
goals and 18 assists, finished the post-season at plus 10 and
manufactured key offensive plays in each of the Red Wings' first
three victories over the Caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do anything specific,'' Yzerman said when asked about
his leadership style. ``I don't think, `What do I do to lead this
team today?' We just kind of go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the Wings see Yzerman's role a little
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see how hard Steve plays every night, how much he
sacrifices for the team,'' said Shanahan, the Wings' wing. ``You
can't do that as a team unless your captain plays that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Scotty Bowman said: ``Steve Yzerman has been through it
all. It starts with him. When you have a player playing as hard as
he does every night, it spills off.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way with Yzerman, whose career in Detroit
underwent wild fluctuations before he finally settled into his
current role as the team's governing spirit. In six seasons from
1987 to 1993, Yzerman averaged 122 points a season and was
generally regarded as the game's third-best offensive center behind
Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. But the Wings' success, especially
in the playoffs, did not equal Yzerman's individual success.
</P>
<P>
   When Bowman took over the team in 1993-94, the Wings were a
talented, explosive offensive team that was also too soft for the
playoff grind. Bowman eventually changed the makeup of the team,
transforming the Red Wings into a gritty squad capable of playing a
strong two-way game. And critical to that makeover was the
transformation of Yzerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We depended on Steve to score too much,'' is Bowman's
explanation. ``When you're not expected to score 65 goals a season,
you can do more things. As you get older, and get more experience,
you evolve into that kind of player. I've seen it happen to a lot
of players.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bowman almost did not see it happen to Yzerman. Early in the
1995-96 season, the Wings were discussing a potential trade
involving Yzerman with the Ottawa Senators. The story in Detroit
goes that Bowman was considering the move when the Red Wings'
owner, Mike Ilitch, stepped in and said Yzerman was not going
anywhere. A year later, the Wings won their first Stanley Cup. On
Tuesday night they were fitted for a second ring and Yzerman was
awarded the Smythe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he likes it this way better,'' Bowman said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan was asked if the Wings' second cup and Yzerman's
performance moved the Wings' captain into the special ring occupied
by Gretzky and Mark Messier as the game's greatest leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to compare him to anyone specifically,''
Shanahan said. ``Each player is unique. But I'll just say this.
I'll say he's now one of the great captains of all time.'' &QL;

   Yzerman &QL; 
invaluable &QL; 
to Wings
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last season, the Detroit Red Wings' march to the
Stanley Cup championship had a ``win one for Stevie'' undertone.
</P>
<P>
   Center Steve Yzerman, their venerated captain, had suffered
through some down seasons in Detroit before the Red Wings turned
things around this decade. When they won the Stanley Cup for the
first time since 1955 last June, the hockey world exulted in
Yzerman's success.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Yzerman bandwagon picked up the campaign that
despite 15 strong seasons in the NHL, he had never won a major
individual award. Now, that has changed as well, as Yzerman was
voted the unanimous winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy, which goes
annually to the most valuable player to his team in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman finished with 24 points in 21 games, the leading scorer
in the playoffs. He had six goals and 18 assists and scored at
least one point in each of the four games in Detroit's sweep of the
Washington Capitals that was completed with a 4-1 victory Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until last year, I hadn't won anything in my career,'' said
Yzerman. ``This is pretty exciting to have this happen. Right now,
I'm having the greatest time I've ever had in my career. This is
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to have my name on a trophy that has some of the
greatest players in the history of hockey on it. When I came into
the league 15 years ago, I don't think anybody knew how to spell my
name or pronounce it. I'm kind of thrilled that the Yzerman name is
going to be on there.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman has been the Red Wings' captain since 1985, when he was
21 years old and Detroit was a struggling team. He adapted to
numerous changes in the organization and is repeatedly cited by
teammates as the glue that holds the team together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Stevie, we wouldn't be where we are right now,'' said
defenseman Nicklas Lidstrom. ``He seems to get better every year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came here four years ago, I heard rumors that there was
no leadership in the Detroit dressing room,'' said veteran
defenseman Slava Fetisov. ``In the last four years, I've never seen
a leader like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman believes that winning two straight Stanley Cup titles
and the Conn Smythe this year does not make him any greater or
lesser of a player than he was during the years when the Wings were
struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it takes any special ingredient that guys who
have won have and guys that haven't won are lacking,'' said
Yzerman. ``Everybody wants to proclaim that this guy is a winner,
that he knows what it takes to win. I think you play hard and if
you're fortunate, you play on a good team that wins a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fear for all those years was never getting the experience
of knowing what it's like to be on the ice in the Stanley Cup
finals and go through the pressure of winning and the
celebration.''

COMMENTARY: ALL BRILL ALL THE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 7th graf for change in wording) (lb) 
 By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the wonderful word ``oleaginous'' didn't exist, someone would
have to invent it to describe Rahm Emanuel, the White House spin
artist who has set the Washington news agenda for this entire week.
</P>
<P>
   It was Emanuel, with downcast eyes and a noble tremor in his
voice, who took to TV on Sunday to herald the cover story of the
new magazine Brill's Content as a ``bombshell'' with implications
not only ``grave'' but also ``serious.'' His was a performance
self-righteous enough to make one shout, ``Bring back Sidney
Blumenthal!''
</P>
<P>
   Emanuel's ``bombshell'' was the news that Ken Starr and company
had been talking to reporters _ and that Starr had admitted so in
an interview with Steven Brill, the magazine's editor and the cover
story's author.
</P>
<P>
   Bombshell? As Brill himself said during one of his nonstop TV
appearances, ``It's no revelation to anyone that Ken Starr has been
leaking material.'' Nor is it a revelation to anyone that Starr
would confess to what Emanuel and Brill (but as yet no judge) call
a misdeed: Starr long ago proved himself the most self-destructive
hunter of gargantuan prey to come our way since Ahab.
</P>
<P>
   But Emanuel is no fool. With his ``bombshell,'' he deflected
attention from his own appearance in the Brill article, which
describes how he ``cynically'' tried to discredit a damaging and
still undisputed New York Times story about Betty Currie's
revelations to Starr investigators.
</P>
<P>
   And he knew the media would take the bait _ even as they faulted
the White House for ``changing the subject'' to Starr _ because
they welcomed the opportunity to avoid the real subject of Brill's
24,000-word piece. The Brill article is called ``Pressgate,'' not
``Starrgate,'' and the bulk of it is about the press's behavior,
not the independent counsel's, during the first three weeks of its
All Monica orgy.
</P>
<P>
   You'd hardly know this from much of the coverage that Brill's
Content is getting, especially on TV, site of the initial hysteria.
You wouldn't know, for instance, that Brill tracks down exactly how
a false ``one-source story from a fifth-hand source,'' about a
Secret Service agent's supposed witnessing of a Monica-Clinton
tryst, was spread as fact by all too many of the country's major
news operations.
</P>
<P>
   Or that he unearths the genesis of the illusory semen-stained
dress and details just how it morphed into the holy grail of
scandal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue in ``Pressgate'' is not that many reporters
talked to prosecutors _ as is their right _ but that a small
minority of them wrote erroneous stories that were then amplified
by the echo chamber of a feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Since the new, Brill-fed frenzy began, most of the press
criticism has been directed at Brill himself _ some of it well
deserved. He should have disclosed his contributions to Democratic
campaigns, including Clinton-Gore, and he should have avoided an
appearance of partisanship by keeping his checkbook shut to start
with.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to argue that Brill, who at The American Lawyer
magazine published the Stuart Taylor Jr. article that rekindled the
Paula Jones case, is a Clinton lackey. Nor is he single-mindedly
anti-press. His article names the names of those who resisted the
stained dress and other unfortunate multimedia pileups.
</P>
<P>
   And at least Brill has said he will admit mistakes _ though
perhaps to a fault, given that his first issue contains a
correction about a prototype issue not seen by the general public.
(He'll probably even run Starr's 19-page letter to the editor.)
</P>
<P>
   What's been remarkable this week is how few in the thin-skinned
media have been willing to concede any errors and how many just
duck Brill's questions altogether.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday ABC News' ``World News Tonight'' ran ``A Closer Look''
about the Brill piece in which Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts
sounded off without so much as acknowledging that their own Sunday
show figures in it at length. On Tuesday a Wall Street Journal
editorial trashed the Brill piece as ``Tabloid Criticism'' without
disclosing that it reports on The Journal's retracted account of a
White House steward and stained tissues.
</P>
<P>
   Only on Wednesday is Brill's Content actually available to
civilian readers. The difference between the cover story they find
there and the one spun by the media and Emanuel could be a future
cover story in itself _ though not, heaven help us, at 24,000
words.

METS SHUT OUT EXPOS, 2-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ It used to take Al Leiter two and a half hours just
to get to the seventh-inning stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old left-hander would throw down and in on hitters
with fastballs and sliders, which would often evolve into deep
counts and plenty of walks. Leiter averaged more than five walks
per nine innings over the first 11 seasons of his major league
career.
</P>
<P>
   But, as Mike Piazza observed after Leiter had completed an
overpowering five-hit shutout in a 2-0 victory on Tuesday night
over the Montreal Expos in an economic 2 hours 26 minutes: ``I
think he's more of a complete pitcher now. He used to live and die
on cutters and fastballs inside and forget all about the outside
corner to right-handed hitters. What he's doing now is getting more
outs on minimal pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter threw just 105 pitches on Tuesday night, with just one
walk mixed in. ``He went into the ninth inning with less than a
hundred pitches,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``You'll have
to ask him when was the last time he did that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``High school,'' answered Leiter (8-3), who won for the fifth
straight time. ``And those were only seven-inning games.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiter added: ``This is the best I've ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an All-Star in my eyes,'' said Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as much as anybody in baseball, he deserves to be on
that team, along with one of his teammates,'' the pitching coach,
Bob Apodaca, said, meaning Rick Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland, who will manage the National League All-Star team
in Denver three weeks from Tuesday, is using a statistical formula
to help determine who will be on his pitching staff. But no matter
how the numbers crunch, it would be difficult to imagine Leyland
leaving Leiter out.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Leiter, who pitched two seasons for Leyland in
Florida, was simply dominating. He struck out seven batters. Of the
five hits he allowed, four of them were singles. Leiter broke three
different Bradley Fullmer bats. No Expo advanced past second base,
and only two _ F.P. Santangelo in the fourth and Shane Andrews in
the eighth _ even made it past first.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout was Leiter's second this season, both coming in the
last 24 days, with Piazza behind the plate. He had only three
shutouts before this season.
</P>
<P>
   The complete-game performance lowered Leiter's earned run
average to 1.53, the best mark in the majors. In 13 starts, he has
allowed just 15 earned runs in 88 1/3 innings. He has walked just
30 batters, an average of 3.1 every nine innings. In seven of his
starts, Leiter has walked two batters or less.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter is now 4-0 following a loss.
</P>
<P>
   To show just how dominant Leiter has been since the Mets General
Manager Steve Phillips obtained him from Leyland's salary-slashing
Florida Marlins during the off-season, Leiter has yet to allow over
three runs in any of his starts this year.
</P>
<P>
   Five times now, Leiter has not allowed any runs at all.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case much of this season, Leiter was able to win
without much offensive support. Piazza, who was playing for the
first time since he strained his shoulder in Miami last Friday,
scored the only run Leiter would need in the top of the sixth, on a
Butch Huskey run-scoring single off Dustin Hermanson (4-6), who
lost despite surrendering just three singles in his six innings of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza went 2 for 5 in his return and is now 25 for 67 (.373) as
a Met. And the catcher fired a bullet to nail Rondell White on an
attempted seventh-inning steal to end the inning with the Mets
still leading by a solitary run.
</P>
<P>
   They added one more in the top of the eighth on John Olerud's
leadoff double and a two-out Rey Ordonez run-scoring single. Two
runs is not much. But eight times this season now, it has been
plenty for Leiter, who was also helped on Tuesday night by a nice
reaching grab by Luis Lopez in left on a ball hit hard by
Santangelo to the warning track in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really has been better probably than he had been in most of
his past years,'' Valentine said of Leiter, who has incorporated a
changeup and curveball into his repertory this season. ``I remember
him as a thrower. Now, we're seeing a left-handed pitcher who has
real good stuff.''

NBA players out, 
Rudy T in Worlds
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NBA players are out and Rudy Tomjanovich is in as coach for the
U.S. team that will play in the World Championship of Basketball
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The executive committee for USA Basketball, the governing arm
for international play by U.S. teams, met Tuesday and voted to
replace the collection of 12 NBA players who had been selected to
play in the World Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich, meanwhile, reaffirmed his commitment to coach the
national team, which will be made up of players from the
Continental Basketball Association and collegians. Also eligible
will be Americans who have been playing professionally overseas and
retired NBA players who do not have prior commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich will be the first NBA coach ever to lead non-NBA
players into international competition for the United States. He
was chosen by USA Basketball to coach the World Championship team
last year. But because of the NBA's labor unrest, his status as
coach had become clouded.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, however, he said there was no doubt in his mind that
he wanted to coach the U.S. team once it was decided that CBA
players would be used in the tournament July 29 through Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm obviously disappointed that I won't be coaching a team
(consisting) of NBA players in the World Championships this
summer,'' he said. ``However, while the makeup of the team will
drastically change, it doesn't change my feelings one bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was selected to coach this team, I stated that I was
extremely honored to be the coach and to represent our country. And
I feel the same way now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This tournament, worldwide, is the biggest thing (in
basketball). And it's an extremely big honor for me. I made a
commitment, and I feel I should stick to that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich will commence the imposing task of fielding a
replacement team for the NBA players who were essentially booted
off the U.S. team Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Players Association last week informed USA Basketball
that the 12 players, most of whom were chosen before the
just-completed season, would make their intentions known July 2
about participating in the World Championship. NBA owners are
planning to lock out the players and reopen
collective-bargaining-agreement negotiations July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Players originally selected to the team were: Detroit's Grant
Hill, Seattle's Vin Baker and Gary Payton, Minnesota's Kevin
Garnett and Tom Gugliotta, Milwaukee's Terrell Brandon, Charlotte's
Glen Rice, New York's Allan Houston, Atlanta's Christian Laettner,
Sacramento's Chris Webber, San Antonio's Tim Duncan and Miami's Tim
Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   ``USA Basketball is extremely disappointed in the position the
original 12 players have taken,'' said Warren Brown, executive
director of USA Basketball. ``On June 12, we received from the
Players Association a letter that players as a courtesy would let
us know on July 2 whether the players would participate. Not that
they would. But whether they would, which emphasized even more to
us that, knowing our commitments, we had to move ahead. That
resulted in a call of the executive committee, at which it was
voted that these players would be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts our organization in the position of being held
hostage. There's a great deal of disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Players Association was lobbying Monday
and Tuesday for USA Basketball to submit the 12 original NBA
players selected to FIBA, the world governing body for basketball.
That roster can include 24 names. But submitting all 12 NBA players
would have left only 12 other slots open. And USA Basketball was
not willing to restrict itself if NBA players proceeded with their
boycott of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Tuesday, Players Association executive director
G. William Hunter said, ``The players wanted to exhaust every
possible opportunity to participate in the World Championships, but
the decision was clearly taken out of their hands by the actions of
USA Basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Tomjanovich both said the new selection process will
include players from the CBA, colleges and any other player who is
not in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The game plan now is to get a roster of at least 24 players and
bring them to Chicago on July 8, when the U.S. team will begin
training camp. Tomjanovich, incidentally, will be given a large
role in choosing the final 12 players who make the U.S. squad.

MARTINEZ LIKELY TO NEED SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Dodgers right-hander Ramon Martinez will receive two
more opinions in the next two days, but it appears he will need
surgery to repair cartilage and rotator-cuff damage in his pitching
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez will be examined this morning by Angels orthopedist
Lewis Yocum, then fly to Birmingham, Ala., where he will be checked
by renowned shoulder specialist William Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, he has the same problem that Todd Hollandsworth
has, plus damage to the rotator cuff,'' Dodgers manager Bill
Russell said. ``A lot depends on what they see in the next couple
of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez left Sunday's start against Colorado complaining of
stiffness. Monday was the one-year anniversary of Martinez going on
the disabled list with a partial tear of the right rotator cuff
that forced him to miss two months last season.
</P>
<P>
   Head trainer Charlie Strasser said Martinez's injury did not
come on one pitch. In his three previous starts, Martinez walked 16
batters and struggled with his mechanics. The key to his 7-2 start
this season was maintaining a consistent delivery that used more of
his body and less of his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martinez does have a cartilage tear on top of the
shoulder, which is similar to Hollandsworth's problem, the extent
of the injury will be checked in the next two days. Hollandsworth
underwent surgery last Thursday and will miss the rest of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of right now, we are expecting him to make a start in seven
to nine days,'' Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire said.
</P>
<P>
   Replacement for Martinez: For now, left-hander Dennis Reyes will
take Martinez's spot in the rotation. He will make Saturday's start
in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes has had two disappointing outings recently in relief.
Against Seattle, 10 days ago, Reyes retired the side in order after
taking over for Dave Mlicki, then walked the bases loaded the next
inning. In his previous appearance, Reyes retired the first eight
Cincinnati Reds, then allowed five consecutive hits in the 12th to
lose 8-4.
</P>
<P>
   Randy who? The Dodgers will continue to evaluate their starting
pitching, but Claire said he does not expect the Mariners' Randy
Johnson to be available.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers and Seattle spoke for five days about Johnson
earlier in the month but could not reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Mariners have been very clear that Randy Johnson
will not be traded,'' Claire said. ``I haven't talked to them and I
don't think I will. But I always listen to anyone that calls.''

Schourek walks his way to peril
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Before Tuesday's game, Mark McGwire spent a considerable amount of
time trying to convince anyone who would listen that the St. Louis
Cardinals are more than a one-man team.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates spent the next few hours proving the point.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' much-anticipated batting-practice session began
at about 5:40 p.m. and lasted into the night as they pounded the
Astros 9-4 before a crowd of 34,822 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The fans came to see McGwire and home runs. They saw both, just
not in the same combination. McGwire walked twice, grounded into a
double play, flied out to right field and struck out. Although he
went hitless in the game, he was a big hit at the box office,
helping the Astros draw their largest weekday crowd since opening
day.
</P>
<P>
   The National League's second-most prolific home-run team belted
three against the Astros as part of a 12-hit assault that included
seven extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy on a baseball team can't dominate like in other
sports,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``We didn't see
McGwire do his thing tonight, but we sure saw it from a lot of
their other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schourek caught the brunt of the Cardinals' fury, allowing
six runs on five hits and a career-high seven walks in just three
innings. Schourek had allowed two runs, six hits and four walks in
his previous 14 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the first couple of pitches, I knew I wasn't going to be
on top of my game,'' Schourek said. ``I thought I could at least
keep us in the game, but I couldn't get ahead (in the count), and I
didn't have much confidence in my stuff. It's hard to win like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Astros missed an opportunity to increase their
two-game lead over the Chicago Cubs in the National League Central.
The Cardinals, who were expected to contend for the division title
but find themselves stuck in next-to-last place, moved within 8{
games of the Astros in what is a pivotal three-game series for the
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know this is a big series,'' said Dave Clark, who started
in left field for the Astros. ``Any time you play a team in your
division, you don't want to let them beat you up and get new life.
We can't let that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was the Astros who appeared a bit lifeless most of
Tuesday night, and probably with good reason. Their team charter
didn't arrive from Cincinnati until 2:30 a.m., and most players
didn't get to bed until at least an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly don't want to sound like I'm making excuses, but I
was pretty tired from a long day (Monday),'' Schourek said. ``Once
I started throwing in the bullpen (before the game), I was just
beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually know what you've got before you go out there, but
I didn't think much of it because I've thrown a lot of good games
after I felt miserable in the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't one of those occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals threatened to make this a laugher, scoring four
times against Schourek in the first inning. Schourek was his own
worst enemy, walking three batters in the inning. Tom Pagnozzi
drove home one of the runs with a sacrifice fly to left, and Gary
Gaetti did the rest of the damage with a three-run homer into the
left-center-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Gaetti led the Cardinals with three hits and three RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' hitters gave Schourek a new lease on life by tying
the game with four runs of their own in the bottom of the first.
Jeff Bagwell's two-run double was the biggest blow, while Ricky
Gutierrez and Brad Ausmus chimed in with RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek (3-5) threw 42 of his 100 pitches in the first inning,
and Cardinals starter Juan Acevedo (2-1) delivered 31 pitches in
the opening frame.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' offense slowed to a crawl after the first, but the
Cardinals kept walking the walk. Schourek issued three more free
passes in the third, including a bases-loaded walk to Brian Hunter
that gave the Cardinals a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete didn't look like he was missing by too much, which
sometimes tells you a guy is trying to be too careful,'' Dierker
said. ``You have to give the Cardinals credit. He made a lot of
close pitches, and they took them. You just can't work around that
many walks.''
</P>
<P>
   After allowing a leadoff double and running the count to 2-0 on
Delino DeShields in the fourth inning, Schourek was hooked in favor
of rookie lefthander Trever Miller, who coaxed a double-play
grounder from McGwire but served up a two-run homer to Brian
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's RBI double off Miller stretched the Cardinals' lead to
8-4 in the fifth inning, and DeShields hit a solo homer in the
eighth off new Astros reliever Reggie Harris to give St. Louis its
final margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros managed just three hits and only five baserunners
after the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like another game after we came right back and tied it
at four in the first inning,'' Clark said. ``We were right back in
the game, but after that, all the air was let out of the balloon.''

GRIEVE SENDS ATHLETICS PAST RANGERS, 9-7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Ben Grieve had a night to remember in his
first major-league game at The Ballpark in Arlington. The Rangers
hope Matt Perisho can forget his night.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve led the merciless assault on Perisho in his first start
with the Rangers, hitting two home runs as the Oakland Athletics
held on for a 9-7 victory. The Rangers have lost five of their past
six games and were knocked out of first place in the American
League West for the first time in 68 days after the Anaheim Angels
beat the Seattle Mariners, 3-2, late last night.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho moved into the rotation on the same day that Bobby Witt
was cut loose but didn't fare much better, giving up seven runs in
2 1/3 innings. He allowed five hits, three walks and hit one
batter.
</P>
<P>
   Grieve, a graduate of Martin High School, did much of the damage
with a two-run homer in the first and a two-run shot in the second,
his first multi-home run game in the major leagues. The rookie was
called up to Oakland last September.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any game to hit two home runs is pretty special,'' Grieve
said. ``To do it here in front of people I know is even more so. It
is pretty exciting.'' Grieve's father, Tom, was in the broadcast
booth as the Rangers' television analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates said he thought Perisho's struggles
were the result of being too excited about his promotion to the
major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worse I've ever seen him, so I know he's better
than that,'' Oates said. ``I've never seen him give up six runs
total, much less one game. I don't think he gave up six runs all
spring (training). He might have been a little excited trying to
impress everybody. He was jumping a little bit and wasn't hitting
his spots. That's not his style of pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho agreed, saying, ``I like to get the ball and throw it,
but I might have been throwing the ball even before I got back on
the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho's spot comes up again on Sunday, but Oates wouldn't say
if he would get another start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comment on that until I talk to (general manager) Doug
Melvin and see what his plans are,'' Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were hoping Perisho would give a boost to a starting
rotation that had a 5.72 earned-run average coming into the game,
second-highest in the American League. Instead, he only made the
recent trend even worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very discouraged,'' Perisho said. ``I really wanted to
help these guys when they needed me. I'm very disappointed I didn't
give them a better effort. The offense scores seven runs, and I
give up seven, that's not right. If they're going to score seven, I
need to keep them under seven. That's very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starters are 1-4 with a 9.20 ERA in their past six games
and have a 6.38 ERA in their past 51 games. Last night marked the
18th time in 69 games a Rangers starter lasted less than five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't keep going to our bullpen in the fourth and fifth
innings or we're going to be dead by the All-Star break,'' Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, trailing 9-0, battled back with two runs in the
fourth and five in the fifth. They even had the tying run on base
in the fifth after Fernando Tatis' two-run single made it a 9-7
game. But Tom Goodwin, with runners on first and third, struck out
against reliever Buddy Groom to end the rally.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Rangers seemed to expend all their energy just
getting it that close. After Tatis singled, Groom and fellow
relievers T.J. Mathews and Bill Taylor combined to retire 13
consecutive Rangers batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just dug too deep a hole,'' Oates said. ``That seems to
have been the script a number of times. Their bullpen matched our
bullpen, but our starter didn't match their starter. We've got to
get some innings out of our starters.''

NIGHT OF HOPE WITH PERISHO PERISHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Lights. Camera. Rerun.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Matt Perisho's debut in a Rangers uniform was memorable
for three things _ one of which may still be traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Perisho was fresh off the Triple-A farm. Admittedly,
he was thrust into a difficult and demanding situation. Admittedly,
I am fresh out of excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, for those who were looking at Perisho as a season's hope
worth clinging to, it was a demoralizing spank in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Seven runs. Two innings. Two home runs by Oakland's Ben Grieve,
one of which might have left vapor trails as it rocketed into the
right-field second deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really trying hard to impress everybody,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates assessed. ``I thought he was jumpy a little
bit, and that's not the way he pitches. He wasn't trying to hit his
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho barely hit anything. He threw 64 pitches, and 31 of them
were balls. Those that were strikes seemed to whiz back in his
teammates' directions at an alarming speed.
</P>
<P>
   Just turned 23, Perisho faced 16 Athletics batters, and nine of
them reached base.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like batting practice. But around here lately, it's
called Rangers starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   And, egads, it has even infected the drinking water. Blessed
with a nine-run lead, Oakland's Mike Oquist couldn't last through
the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dark day all around. Bobby Witt's pitching merited
yesterday's pink slip, but somber faces in the Rangers' clubhouse
reflected the loss of Witt, the person.
</P>
<P>
   Former club general manager, now broadcaster, Tom Grieve first
saw Witt when Bobby was pitching for the U.S. Olympic team in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen his whole career _ the highs, the lows,'' Grieve
said. ``And I don't think that, with the exception maybe of Steve
Buechele and Geno Petralli, there's ever been a player that I
thought more of than Bobby Witt.''
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the agate transactions today will be the fact that Witt
was 7-0 at one point just 13 months ago. But Witt's signature in
recent seasons is that he logged a lot of innings. And somewhere
between last year's 7-0 and this season's dreadful 7.66 earned-run
average, Bobby Witt pitched his way out of the Rangers' future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we showed some patience, looking for changes,''
Oates said. ``But I didn't see a whole lot of changes in Bobby.''
</P>
<P>
   If Witt is wise, he will stay home in Colleyville for the rest
of this season and work up a sweat only driving to cash the
Rangers' paychecks. With rest and a vigorous off-season, he could
well be invited to somebody's spring training camp next season.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not getting anybody out now. A hasty change of scenery
might only prompt teams to write him out of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as one page turned here last night, the attention turned
to Perisho. He earned his long-awaited first start on the modest
wings of a 7-5 record and 4.00 ERA at Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   So, what did he do there, anyway, Oates was asked?
</P>
<P>
   The manager formed a pair of imaginary quote marks with his
fingers and answered, ``Pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates said, ``He got people out.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had pretty good stuff,'' Perisho said. ``I just
didn't execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``My command just wasn't there. I was so caught up in trying to
get people out, my focus was more on the big picture than one pitch
at a time. Before I knew it, I was down, 7-0.''
</P>
<P>
   With Witt erased, however, Perisho's performance was not so much
a trial as it was a job interview. There are more moves to be made,
probably beginning with the imminent call-up of another Martin High
graduate, pitcher Todd Van Poppel.
</P>
<P>
   The task is simple. The best five arms _ whether some belong to
Perisho, Van Poppel or a rumor named Pete Harnisch _ will pitch
and, somehow, try to halt the current Rangers slide.
</P>
<P>
   They have lost five of their past six in ominously lackluster
fashion. June has been an unkind 7-8.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has been spotty. The hitting has run the gamut from
sporadic to less-than-timely.
</P>
<P>
   But it's the starting pitching that has sucked the juice out of
what was once a robust and promising division lead.
</P>
<P>
   In Darren Oliver and John Burkett, Oates said he has at least
seen signs of improvement. Some of us would demand a peek at that
microscope.
</P>
<P>
   But Perisho was expected to come in, fill a starter's role and,
if nothing else, provide hope.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was another night of summer reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Lights. Camera. Yikes.

RED WINGS SWEEP UP SECOND STRAIGHT CUP 
</HEADLINE>
 WINGS-CAPITALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were just too much. The Detroit Red Wings were
too talented, too deep, too fast, and too experienced for the
Washington Capitals. And as a result of their 4-1 victory in Game 4
Tuesday night at the MCI Center, they are the Stanley Cup champions
for the second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings become the first team to repeat as champion since
the 1991 and '92 Pittsburgh Penguins. They are the first team to
earn back-to-back 4-0 sweeps in the finals since the Islanders in
1982 and '83.
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Bowman earned his eighth Cup as a coach, tying him with
the great Toe Blake of Montreal for all-time honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real good influence on me,'' said Bowman. ``To be
thought of in the same breath is a real honor for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Red Wings captain Steve Yzerman was awarded the Conn Smythe
Trophy as the most valuable player in the postseason. He was a
unanimous selection.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was especially poignant in light of the presence of
defenseman Vladimir Konstantinov, who was instrumental in the
Wings' run to the Cup last year but whose career was ended when he
was seriously injured in a limousine accident a few days after the
team's victory. Yzerman and his teammates were overwhelmed at the
sight of Konstantinov being wheeled onto the ice to share in the
celebration. After carrying the Cup, Yzerman handed it to
Konstantinov, who, in a wheelchair, was able to hold it with help
from his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very emotional,'' said Yzerman. ``A year ago at this
time, we were told he and (team masseur Sergei Mnatsakonov) might
not live. A year later, for him to be on the ice with us is pretty
significant. Throughout the year, we were aware of his progress. He
was never forgotten on our team, but he was never used as a
motivational ploy. They're two really special guys for different
reasons on our team. Our team has just grown closer throughout the
last year. The only thing we really care about is winning and
playing well together.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome may have been the same as in the first three games,
but the decisive win marked the first game in this series not
decided by a goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings started Tuesday's game the same way they started
the previous three _ by taking the lead. Former Boston College
standout Doug Brown put Detroit up, 1-0, with a power-play goal at
10:30, set up brilliantly by center Sergei Fedorov. Fedorov cycled
around the right side, lulling the Capitals under his spell. Then
Brown came bolting down the left side. Fedorov dished a pass from
the right point underneath the stick of Washington center Adam
Oates to Brown in the left circle. Brown fired a shot that beat
goalie Olaf Kolzig through the pads as Wings left wing Tomas
Holmstrom used the blade of his stick to tie up Kolzig's stick.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit dominated the rest of the period. The Capitals could
barely penetrate the Red Wings' zone, and when they did, they
couldn't forecheck and could barely generate a shot, much less a
scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Red Wings upped the lead to two goals
when right wing Martin Lapointe scored from long range. Center Igor
Larionov wheeled around the right circle and fed Lapointe just
inside the blue line. Lapointe blasted the puck from the middle of
the point, and it sailed past Kolzig at 2:26. It was Lapointe's
ninth goal of the playoffs, and it appeared the Red Wings were
going to romp to their second straight Cup.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Capitals rallied midway through the period, pulling
within 2-1. Detroit defenseman Jamie Macoun turned over the puck in
the Red Wings' zone, leading to a Brian Bellows goal at 7:49. Oates
assisted, giving him 100 career playoff assists, good for 13th in
NHL history. It was the only shot that beat goalie Chris Osgood,
who had 30 saves.
</P>
<P>
   That woke up the crowd, but less than four minutes later, the
Red Wings regained their two-goal lead. The Detroit power play, 0
for 12 entering Game 4, capitalized for the second time to make it
3-1. Holmstrom, behind the Washington net, dished a pass to
defenseman Larry Murphy in the right circle, and Murphy fired it
over Kolzig's glove at 11:46. Fedorov picked up his second assist.
</P>
<P>
   Brown scored his second of the game at 1:32 of the third,
boosting the lead to an insurmountable 4-1. Slava Kozlov, in the
left circle, threaded a perfect pass to Brown, who was charging the
net. Brown popped in the shot at the right post, the Red Wings'
third power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of what we did,'' said Washington coach Ron Wilson.
``I'm very proud of our team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have kind of an empty feeling right now,'' said Kolzig, who
had a remarkable playoff run. ``But in a few weeks, it will pass
and we'll realize how great a season we had.''

   Mac attack lesser &QL; 
of Astros' worries
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EVERYBODY came out to watch the big dog bite. Almost 20,000 people
saw fit to boo and cheer during batting practice as Mark McGwire,
America's latter-day Paul Bunyan, took his Ruthian rips for the
first time as a professional in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rat, Gary Gaetti, had a bigger night. So did several of
the other Redbirds.
</P>
<P>
   Rats.
</P>
<P>
   On both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were 12 hits and 11 runs before the fourth inning
ended, McGwire's contribution to St. Louis' share of same was
mostly passive, albeit hardly negative. He scored twice on a pair
of walks _ the first had preceded Gaetti's three-run home run _
then grounded into a double play right before Brian Jordan socked a
two-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Schourek's pitch count reached triple digits without him
making it out of the fourth inning. If the Astros ultimately lose
the National League Central, it will be because of games like this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Even Delino DeShields went yard off Reggie Harris, although the
emergency Astro, Mike Hampton's roster replacement, immediately
redeemed himself _ and provided a nice story for his grandchildren
_ by whiffing McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, Gaetti, Jordan and DeShields have 22 homers.
McGwire, of course, has 31. You look at Tuesday's 9-4 final, and
you can't believe the Mack truck went 0-for-3 with only his weak
fly to right, in five plate appearances, leaving the infield in
fair territory.
</P>
<P>
   Downer early
</P>
<P>
   Hampton's inevitable landing on the disabled list had started
what figured to be a festive evening on a downhill run, and the
Astros never recovered. As badly as the Cardinals are heaving
baseballs toward home plate, the Astros found a way to do it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Pete was trying to be too fine or what,''
manager Larry Dierker said. ``I don't mind him being careful with
McGwire. But you've got to go after the other guys. It's hard to
pitch around that many walks.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if McGwire, ever a marked man, had been allowed to do
his usual dirty work. Schourek was so knees-knocking careful with
No. 25, whose homer count to date factors out to a season total of
73, he forgot how to throw strikes, period, issuing seven free
passes before he trudged back to the dugout, arm dragging, to more
than a smattering of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   People were miffed, I think, because if the Astros had to take
such a drubbing, they wanted it to be somewhat of McGwire's doing.
Baseball, still a damaged game, its cancer only in remission, can't
have too many heroes who are appreciably larger than life. McGwire
is such a figure, Mighty Casey-esque in both stature and
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Young or old, you hold your breath while he awaits every pitch.
Amazing things can always happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically,'' Dierker said, ``it's a little different
facing them because nobody has ever been as hot as McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   Going back only to the start of the 1996 season, he has 141 home
runs. Despite his feats of late, though, it's a fact that St. Louis
stands a minus-13 to .500 since his celebrated arrival from Oakland
at the outset of August last season.
</P>
<P>
   The message? Herculean hitting may sell the most tickets, but
those guys on the hill always hold the key to the pearly gates of
postseason happiness.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire can belt 80 dingers between now and the end of
September, each one longer than the previous, and the Cardinals
will still be buried in the nether regions of the division
standings if their earned run average stays where it is today,
pushing 5.00.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen teams lead the league in runs scored and finish
last,'' Dierker said. ``But you will never see a team lead the
league in ERA and finish last.''
</P>
<P>
   Weakened dam
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have remained atop the standings for almost the
entire season because their arms have kept a leg up on
expectations. Unfortunately, with Hampton down for at least his
next two starts after pulling a groin muscle in Cincinnati on
Monday night, the dam is showing signs of giving way.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Ramon Garcia and maybe Chris Holt, who himself went on
the 60-day DL Tuesday. Then there's Doug Henry, who won't pitch
before the weekend because of an ouchy elbow. At the current
attrition rate, Dierker may have to activate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, the Astros signed Lee Smith, who is at least as old as
dirt, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   The skipper said he could, in a pinch, probably get a man to hit
a grounder to first base, but he doubted he could cover. Afterward,
however, Dierker didn't feel much like being funny.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Hampy's hurting, probably the result of an ill-timed,
50-minute rain delay in Cincy, he knows how tenuous the Astros'
grip on first place is. Mark McGwire is one of his lesser problems,
if not the least of them.

   Red Wings relive &QL; 
their sweep dream
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ After a 42-year drought for the Detroit Red Wings,
it's raining Stanley Cups on the most dominant team in the National
Hockey League during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings won their second straight championship Tuesday
night, beating Washington 4-1 and sweeping the outmanned Capitals
4-0. The sweep was the second straight for Detroit and the fourth
in a row in the finals, the first time that has happened in league
history.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Detroit had beaten the Caps in nearly every
aspect except one _ the power play. They took care of that in the
clinching game, breaking an 0-for-12 slide with a 3-for-4
performance with the man advantage. Doug Brown scored the first and
last goal for the Red Wings, with Martin Lapointe and Larry Murphy
adding second-period goals.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Yzerman was held off the board Tuesday, but he finished
with a league-high 24 points in 22 games and was named the winner
of the Conn Smythe Trophy as the MVP of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Scotty Bowman won his eighth Stanley Cup as a coach,
tying Toe Blake for the most by a coach. Blake's final title for
Montreal came in 1968, when the Canadians beat the St. Louis Blues,
who were coached by Bowman in his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional moment on the ice after Thursday's game,
Vladimir Konstantinov, injured last year in an auto accident six
days after the Wings won the Cup, took part in the award
ceremonies. Konstantinov, a rugged defenseman who was a key member
of last year's team, suffered severe head injuries and remains
confined to a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 16th win (in the playoffs) was for No. 16 (Konstantinov's
jersey number,'' said Detroit defenseman Slava Fetisov. ``I know
he's going to be walking soon. I know that. He's a great man.''
</P>
<P>
   After Yzerman, the captain of the Wings, accepted the Cup from
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, he skated to Konstantinov and handed
him the trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional moment, since we've had him in our
thoughts all year,'' said Yzerman. ``It was the appropriate thing
to do. I mean, a year ago we were told he might not live. To be on
the ice when we won again was pretty significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings had not won the Stanley Cup since 1955 when they
swept Philadelphia last season. This time, they waited only one
year and nine days to become the first team since Pittsburgh in
1991-92 to repeat as the NHL champion. The Red Wings have been in
the finals three of the last four years, losing in 1995 to New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we won last year, you say `If we never win again, we'll
be happy,''' said Yzerman. ``That's not true. As soon as the
playoffs came around this year, you could tell everybody wanted it
more. In that way, it was very satisfying to win it again.''
</P>
<P>
   A pattern that the Caps couldn't find a way to change doomed
them in the franchise's first-ever appearance in the finals.
Detroit dominated the first period again Tuesday, taking a 1-0 lead
on Brown's first goal at 10:30.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit outshot the Caps 14-6 to run their first-period total in
the series to a remarkable 51-21. Considering that number,
Detroit's 5-0 bulge in first-period goals could have been much
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seemed to beat us in just about every single area,'' said
Washington coach Ron Wilson. ``Not by a large margin, but in a lot
of ways. They came in and knew exactly what to do. Each game, the
first scoring chance they had went in. That just seemed to knock
the wind out of us each time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings carried the play much of the period. After an
excellent offensive shift by Kirk Maltby, Joey Kocur and Kris
Draper, a Red Wings fan seated in the upper reaches of MCI Center
shouted: ``And that's our fourth line.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was frontline player who set up the Wings' first goal.
With Detroit on the power play, Sergei Fedorov executed a spin move
in the corner and made a rink-wide pass that landed on Brown's
stick. Brown beat Washington goaltender Olaf Kolzig, and Detroit
continued its first-period blitzkrieg.
</P>
<P>
   In the four games, the Red Wings scored on their sixth, fifth,
first and fourth shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the story of the series,'' said Washington defenseman
Joe Reekie. ``They scored in the first period, and we played
catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, Kolzig, whose excellent work in goal
has been a constant throughout the playoffs, was guilty of a rare
stumble. After taking a pass from Igor Larionov, Lapointe sent a
quick but seemingly stoppable shot at Kolzig. The puck, however,
beat Kolzig on the right side along the ice to make it 2-0 at 2:26.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when Brown scored a power-play goal at 1:32 of the final
period to make it 4-1, there was no doubt that the Wings would be
just as efficient as the last three Stanley Cup winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed our team had a lot of ways to win,'' said Bowman.
``We were totally focused. We had a tough season, getting over the
accident. Coming in, I wasn't sure if we could win another Cup. But
as time went on, Vladie's recovery was a big influence on our team.
We weren't going to let down.''

MARTINEZ, RED SOX SUBDUE WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-WHITE SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The mystery of Pedro Martinez is no mystery at all.
The more pitches he throws, the better the result. It sounds
strange, but it seems to work for the gifted Red Sox righthander.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night he threw a season-high 140 pitches in just seven
innings to beat the Chicago White Sox, 6-1, at Comiskey Park. But
that's just what he needed, Martinez said _ a gut-wrenching outing
in which he could push himself to the limit without fear that one
bad pitch would send him to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he did give up a monster 418-foot home run to Frank Thomas
in the fifth inning, which cut Boston's lead to 3-1. Martinez also
walked five, which can happen when he's throwing a lively fastball
and a temperamental breaking ball.
</P>
<P>
   But how can you complain when your starter gives up only four
hits and strikes out 11? When he needed to be, Martinez was
dominating. He ended all but one of his seven innings with a
strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I needed to air it out,'' said Martinez (8-2), who had
given up four home runs in each of his last two starts and been
roughed up uncharacteristically in each of his last four. ``Let it
go and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody goes through a slump. I'm glad I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His best inning was perhaps his last inning,'' said manager
Jimy Williams. ``He threw quite a few pitches, but maybe he needs
those pitches. I don't necessarily like to do that with pitchers.
But he's a kid who can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro had very good command and location. The ball was coming
out of his hands very easy. It was alive. He didn't try to muscle
it. He used his arm and his legs.''
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 13,483 came to Comiskey Park expecting a pitchers'
duel. Reggie Jefferson changed that forecast in a hurry. After
Jason Bere opened the game by walking Darren Lewis, Jefferson
belted his seventh home run of the year for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that would have been enough cushion for Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team tonight is together,'' Martinez said. ``They did well.
I did well. Hopefully, this is the turnaround.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the offensive support was excellent as the Red Sox
pounded out 12 hits. Jefferson had three, as did Nomar Garciaparra
and Lou Merloni.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's output, which boosted his average to .300,
included a seventh-inning triple that set up Boston's final run; he
scored on Troy O'Leary's two-out single. Merloni had a two-run
double in the sixth that made it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``My team deserves the credit,'' said Martinez. ``So do my
manager and my pitching coach. I really appreciate that Joe
(Kerrigan) and Jimy trusted me that long.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should thank Jefferson, too. With fellow DH Jim Leyritz
stirring up controversy about players' roles on the team, Jefferson
went out like a professional hitter and did his thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a game plan and an approach to hitting,'' said
Jefferson. ``I knew what I wanted to do out there. The thing that
helps me is a will to go out and put up numbers. I know it's tough
to do when your at-bats are limited. But I still say I've got to do
it or I won't be here. That's what motivates me.''

ANGELS MOVE INTO FIRST PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels will welcome back manager Terry Collins
tonight with the best present he could have hoped for _ first
place.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday night's 3-2 win over the Seattle Mariners, the
Angels took over the lead in the American League West by one-half
game over the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Collins completed his eight-game suspension Tuesday night for
the June 2 fight with Kansas City. When he began the suspension,
the Angels trailed the Rangers by three games. After going 6-2
during Collins' absence, the Angels grabbed the division lead for
the first time since April 9.
</P>
<P>
   They got another strong outing from starting pitcher Jason
Dickson (7-4), who gave up two runs and seven hits in seven innings
to get the win. After starting the season 1-4, Dickson has won six
consecutive decisions, including four in a row as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels bullpen _ Mike Holtz, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Troy
Percival _ combined to throw two perfect innings to close it out.
Percival pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to record his league-leading 21st
save of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got all the offense they would need in the first
three innings off Mariners starter Bill Swift (6-4) and reliever
Bob Wells. Jim Edmonds had a two-run single in the first inning and
Matt Walbeck drove in the third run with a single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mariners have watched helplessly as their season
has fallen apart before their eyes. Coming off a division title,
the Mariners were supposed to contend for the AL West title but
instead went into Tuesday's game in last place, 11{ games out of
first. The problems include a horrible bullpen, the Randy Johnson
situation and losing Jay Buhner for two months. But nothing seems
to be getting any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total (expletive) mess,'' Mariners manager Lou Piniella
said. ``We can't catch and we can't throw. You just do the best you
can and don't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mariners management has said it won't trade Johnson, the
club seems eager to make whatever changes it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of areas we'd like to make changes,''
Mariners general manager Woody Woodward told the Seattle Times.
``Up to now we've been letting the guys on the roster try to pull
this together, and it hasn't been working. If I could do something
now to shake up the club, I'd love to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, say they aren't about to take the Mariners
lightly, last place or not, having seen the Mariners rally from a
13-game deficit in August of 1995 to win the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still a talented team,'' Tim Salmon said. ``We've seen
them come back from 13 games before. I don't put it past them.
They're definitely a team you can't take lightly. You still go
after them like they're a first-place team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got help from the Mariners immediately Tuesday, as
first baseman David Segui booted Darin Erstad's grounder leading
off the bottom of the first inning. Dave Hollins doubled Erstad to
third, and both scored when Edmonds singled to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels increased their lead to 3-0 in the third inning when
Walbeck's two-out single to center scored Salmon from second.
Third-base coach Larry Bowa appeared to give Salmon the stop sign.
But Salmon, who is limited to DH duty because of a torn ligament in
his left foot, ran through it and scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson held the Mariners scoreless through five innings but
gave up two runs in the sixth. Edgar Martinez's RBI groundout and
Glenallen Hill's RBI double cut the Angels' lead to 3-2.

EDITORIAL: STILL TIME TO OVERHAUL THE COURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   New York's legislature may close down for the season this week,
and slink home after having done virtually nothing but pass
fiscally dangerous tax cuts. However, there is still time to change
things. A breakthrough plan to reorganize the state's inefficient
and complicated court system can be approved if only Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver summons the will to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing makes the virtues of the plan more obvious than Silver's
attempts to avoid responsibility for killing it. So far, his
strategy has been to tie it to a bill providing a permanent funding
source for legal services for the poor. The legal services cause is
important, but it is being used here merely as a poison pill to
make the court reorganization plan unpalatable to Senate
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The state's courts are a mess, impossibly complicated and
inefficient. The reorganization plan is the product of years of
work by Chief Judge Judith Kaye, an appointee of Mario Cuomo. Her
work has been endorsed by virtually every good-government group in
the state, as well as Gov. George Pataki. Republicans in the Senate
seem to be acting in good faith. They prepared a serious bill in
plenty of time for action, and their proposal is close to Kaye's.
Its questionable features could easily be bargained away in
negotiations with the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are afraid court reorganization will take away
patronage, such as attorney's fees for handling estates in
Surrogate Court. They also worry that reorganization might reduce
their control over judicial appointments in New York City. The
Assembly was very slow to produce a bill. The one that emerged
incorporated only part of Kaye's plan, added a big step backward on
merit selection of judges and weighed the whole package down with
the poison pill of legal services funding, which the Democrats
claimed was not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   Because it involves amending the state's constitution, any court
reorganization bill must be approved by two separately elected
legislatures and by the voters in a statewide election. If Silver
negotiates seriously with the Senate, the plan can pass before a
new legislature is elected this fall and go into effect in January
2000.
</P>
<P>
   If Silver fails to act, or the Assembly passes a meaningless
bill that cannot get Senate approval, the reorganization will at
best be delayed until 2002, and very possibly succumb permanently
to Albany torpor. The state will lose tens of millions of dollars a
year in savings. Citizens will continue to struggle with the most
complicated court system in the nation, which features 11 separate
trial courts, including different venues for divorce and
child-custody cases.
</P>
<P>
   Too often in Albany, politicians spend more time plotting a
posture that will allow them to shift the blame than actually
trying to make progress through compromise. This week, Silver can
take a bold step toward reform, or he can fall back on the
legislature's traditional tactics of evasion. If he fails to do the
right thing, opponents of incumbent Democratic Assembly members
this fall will have a right to blame them for the lost opportunity.

EDITORIAL: THE BUNKER IS NOT A LAUGHING MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 17:
</P>
<P>
   Given Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's talent for making enemies _ as in
hot dog vendors, jaywalkers and taxi drivers _ it is hard to resist
poking fun at his latest plan for a $15 million bunker, or ``crisis
center,'' as the mayor's supporters prefer to call it. Despite the
merriment this inspires in the city's journalists and talk-show
hosts, the mayor's proposal makes sense. Crisis experts have said
for some time that New York City desperately needs a modernized
command center to cope with sudden emergencies ranging from
blackouts to floods or riots and even biological or chemical
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's bunker idea was tucked into a back corner of his
capital-budget proposal for this year. The price tag would be $15
million. As now planned, it would occupy space on the 23d floor of
7 World Trade Center in downtown Manhattan, commanding unobstructed
views and proximity to federal agencies whose expertise is often
crucial in emergencies. City officials decided to lease the space
as the most secure and usable of more than 50 buildings surveyed in
the last year and a half. Once constructed, the command hub would
be able to withstand hurricane winds, bullets and some kinds of
bombs. It will have work space for 100 people with back-up
electricity, phone lines and elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if a Hollywood-sized Armageddon hits _ the asteroid
or the tidal wave _ this center would crumble into a pile of rubble
like everything else. In the event of a nuclear attack, let's face
it, we're vapor, including the mayor and his colleagues at command
central. For other disasters, however, the city's trained emergency
managers need the best possible place to work. Some will argue
about the cost. This could be the subject of negotiations, assuming
that the mayor and City Council are still talking. Nevertheless,
New York needs a four-star command post. The mayor's crisis center
deserves to survive the jokes and the politics of City Hall.

   BRUSSELS _ Once more, miserable groups of old people, women and
children stream down Balkan mountainsides, fleeing their burning
homes. With Bosnia fresh in the mind, calls for NATO action in
Kosovo are becoming more strident.
</P>
<P>
   A number of immediate measures were agreed upon at the recent
meeting of the alliance's foreign ministers, and further options
are under examination. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana has
said repeatedly that ``nothing is ruled out.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing should be ruled out: an armed incursion by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison with Bosnia is erroneous and dangerous. In
Bosnia, Muslims were defending themselves against murder and
expulsion by well-armed Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, the self-styled army of liberation is fighting the
regular Yugoslav military in an attempt to break away from Serbia.
A NATO incursion would be seen as support for that movement _
something else again from stopping mass murder.
</P>
<P>
   The postwar European settlement was determined by the 1975 Final
Act of the Helsinki Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe. This rests on the maxim that frontiers will not be changed
by force.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, consisting of Serbia and
Montenegro, is a legally recognized country with internationally
accepted borders. Kosovo is a province of Serbia, whatever the
so-called ethnic composition of its population.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking or circumventing this maxim would be extremely
dangerous. It would be opposed by other parties to the Final Act,
Russia in particular. It would also open a Pandora's box in the
ethnically intermingled Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a practical aspect: An attack by NATO in Kosovo
would be countered by regular Yugoslav troops. Unlike the ragtag
forces of the Bosnian Serbs, this is a disciplined and
well-organized force that would be defending its homeland against
external aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO could undoubtedly raise a larger and technically
far superior force, an attack could be extremely costly in terms of
Yugoslav and allied casualties. The outcome would be uncertain; it
could well become NATO's Suez.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, neither the will nor the means for such action exist in
the alliance. The U.S. Congress is attempting to reduce military
commitments overseas. All European allies are streamlining their
forces and shaping them for rapid deployment to crisis points
rather than for engagement in a massive, possibly drawn-out,
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Kosovo crisis must be faced. In addition to
the increasing exodus of refugees, the danger of the conflict's
spreading to neighboring countries is evident.
</P>
<P>
   It could draw in Albania as well as Macedonia and Bulgaria,
which have sizable ethnic Albanian elements, in addition to Greece
and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   As immediate measures, NATO will begin helping Albania
reconstitute its army and will organize peacekeeping exercises in
Albania and Macedonia. It is also sending a naval force to the
Albanian port of Durres, and an airborne warning and control
detachment is to move to Macedonia this week.
</P>
<P>
   Further options include deploying NATO forces along the Albanian
border with Kosovo, reinforcing the small U.N. force in Macedonia
and establishing a no-fly zone, similar to that enforced over
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But an incursion into Kosovo is not under consideration, and
suggestions that one is are dangerous and harmful.
</P>
<P>
   As long as intervention appears a possibility, it raises
expectations that cannot be met and that can result in actions by
the Kosovo Liberation Army that would cause further bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia is rightly detested
for the havoc he has caused with his policies and actions. He
should be made to respect the rights of individuals and minorities.
But methods and organizations other than NATO exist _ and action by
them is now essential. &QL;

DODGERS LOSE, FALL 10{ BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Bit by bit, the Dodgers season is slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   They found out in Tuesday's 10-6 loss to the San Diego Padres at
QualComm Stadium that Chan Ho Park was not ready step up and
replace injured ace Ramon Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   In any other June, they could have absorbed the pounding Park
took in front of 38,166, but this isn't just any June. The loss
dropped the Dodgers 10{ games back in the National League West,
their biggest deficit in nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
   With Martinez facing surgery on the right shoulder he injured
Sunday, the Dodgers were hoping Park (5-4) could regain the command
that made him the club's top pitcher last season.
</P>
<P>
   They even spotted him a 2-0 lead on home runs by Gary Sheffield
and Raul Mondesi on a rare night when Padres right-hander Kevin
Brown (7-3) did not have his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers now have dropped three straight and looked
awful against a team that is threatening to run away with the
division. San Diego won for the eighth straight time and ran its
home record to 25-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who finally appeared to have passed the .500
barrier for good last Friday, are 34-35.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Dodgers held a players-only meeting with
hopes of regaining some of the fire lost in back-to-back losses to
Colorado on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They were facing a Padres team that moved back into first by
sweeping the San Francisco Giants over the weekend. The Giants won
Tuesday, remaining 3{ back.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers rallied for three runs in the ninth inning against
right-hander Brian Boehringer. Jose Vizcaino singled home two runs
and Sheffield followed with an RBI double. But Trevor Hoffman came
on to get the final out for his 21st save in 21 opportunities, the
only closer in the major who is perfect this season.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sheffield continued his hot hitting since joining
the club in the big May 15 trade with the Florida Marlins. His
three hits improved his batting average to .352 (35 for 96) since
joining the club.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, however, is Bobby Bonilla, who continues to
struggle since his first weekend with the club. Tuesday, Bonilla
went 0 for 4, including an inning-ending double play in the eighth
after the first two batters reached base.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who was 2 for 20 on the homestand, has one hit in his
last 24 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Park was coming off his first victory since May 13 when he
allowed just one run in eight innings against Oakland last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But against the streaking Padres, Park had to be that good again
_ and he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   His first mistake was allowing a single to Brown with one out in
the third. Quilvio Veras followed with a base hit to left. After
Steve Finley flied to left, Tony Gwynn lined a two-out, two-run
double to right-center that tied the score 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took a 3-2 lead in the fourth without barely taking
the bat off their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Joyner walked with one out and went to second on an
infield out. He moved to third on a passed by catcher Charles
Johnson and scored on a wild pitch by Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres took the lead for good in the sixth when Gwynn opened
with a single to left and Ken Caminiti hit a two-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   For Caminiti, who missed most of May with a strained left thigh,
it was the continuation of a great June.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit safely in the last seven games _ all Padres
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn returned to the Padres lineup for the first time in six
games and acted like he was never gone.
</P>
<P>
   He pinch hit Friday night and his sacrifice fly to the warning
track brought more than 60,000 fans to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres appeared to blow open the game in the seventh when
former Dodger Carlos Hernandez lined a three-run double into the
left field corner against Mark Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie allowed a fourth run and all of them were unearned. With
one out, Greg Vaughn grounded to short, but Eric Young did not
touch the bag as he tried to complete a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Second base umpire Jim Quick ruled the base runner, Caminiti,
was safe. When Hernandez doubled it just seemed like piling on. It
turned out to be a critical play.

VALLEY DIVISION WINS CAL LEAGUE ALL-STAR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER _ The much-maligned Freeway Division was giving the
California League and a Lancaster Municipal Stadium crowd of 4,714
what few expected: a competitive California All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The quintet that saw its first-half champion finish just two
games over .500 refused to bow down to a Valley Division that
claimed four of five teams completing the halfway mark with at
least a .500 record, including first-place San Jose's 46-24 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Freeway took a major detour in the fifth inning, however,
and the favored Valley Division took command, scoring five times to
win 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Freeway Division pitcher Brent Iddon of the Rancho Cucamonga
Quakes was the victim of both timely Valley hitting and shoddy
defense by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage began with singles by Michael Byas and Jeff DaVanon.
With Byas at third, right fielder Luke Allen misjudged Josh
Klimek's fly ball for a three-base error and the go-ahead runs.
</P>
<P>
   Iddon recorded one out but yielded a smash off the
right-center-field fence by Modesto's Cody McKay for a triple. When
Allen bobbled the ball for his second error of the inning, the
catcher chugged around third and scored to make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The circus atmosphere didn't stop there. Rod Barajas doubled and
moved to third on a groundout. With Visalia's Mike Holmes in for
Iddon, JetHawk Adonis Harrison's grounder to the right side was
booted by second baseman Dionys Cesar of Visalia.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Juan Dilone, a 25-year-old veteran of seven
minor-league seasons, was the unanimous choice as the game's most
valuable player. The Dominican Republic native slammed a
second-inning home run off UCLA product Pete Zamora as part of a
3-for-4, three-RBI night.
</P>
<P>
   JetHawks right-hander Brian Sweeney struck out the side
sandwiched between a walk in his one inning to earn the pitching
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Freeway Division started quickly when San Bernardino's Rich
Saitta hit the 1-2 pitch of San Jose's Jason Grote over the
right-center-field fence for a home run leading off the game. Twice
the Valley Division tied the score but fell behind a run, the last
time in the top of the fifth when JetHawks ace Patrick Dunham
allowed the go-ahead run on Luke Allen's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   This All-Star game meant as much to Visalia's Duane Filchner
than perhaps to any of the remaining 43 players. The 25-year-old,
in his fourth season with the Oakland A's organization, retired
following the game in favor of a position in the athletic
department at Radford University. Filchner participated in the
pregame home run contest and thrilled the crowd by going deep 12
times in the opening round.
</P>
<P>
   Filchner, who singled in three at-bats as the starting
designated hitter, reached the finals against Modesto's McKay.
After each hit one home run, McKay defeated his Oakland teammate
with a homer over the fence in right in a one-pitch tiebreaker.
Combining the three rounds, Filchner actually outhomered McKay
19-18. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

AFI'S TOP 100 FILMS LIST LACKS REAL AMERICAN FEEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The American Film Institute's official list of
the 100 greatest American movies of all time is finally out and it
looks, well, mighty official.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen from a ballot of 400 titles and voted upon by some 1,500
film industry professionals, academics and critics, the top 100 is
almost pathologically balanced between well-known artistic
milestones and widely beloved entertainments. The pattern is
established right at the top with ``Citizen Kane'' and
``Casablanca,'' long considered Hollywood's ultimate auteur and
studio-system movies, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The list appears almost machine-tooled to satisfy both aesthete
and sentimentalist, the spectacle-dazzled and the fans of
character-driven fare (``Lawrence of Arabia'' at No. 5, ``The
Graduate'' at No. 7), and young and old. Indeed, the titles split
50-50 before and after 1960, the year Billy Wilder's
frank-for-its-time, 93rd-ranked ``The Apartment'' won the Oscar and
Alfred Hitchcock's 18th-ranked ``Psycho'' effectively changed all
the rules.
</P>
<P>
   While this seems unusually neat for even a semi-democratic
enterprise, the list managed to include space for a few fun
surprises. ``Chinatown,'' at No. 19, ranked higher than one would
expect the best-written movie of all time would in a poll conducted
primarily among Hollywood insiders, a group notorious for its
collective contempt of literary quality.
</P>
<P>
   Along those same lines, it was nice to see the rigorously
challenging likes of Stanley Kubrick's ``2001: A Space Odyssey''
(No. 22) and ``Dr. Strangelove'' (No. 26), Martin Scorsese's
``Raging Bull'' (No. 24) and even ``The Godfather Part II'' (at No.
32, the only sequel on the list) so high in the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they were all beaten by ``Star Wars'' (No. 15) and
``Gone With the Wind'' (No. 4), but it would have been foolish to
expect otherwise. This was always going to be a popularity contest
as much as a measure of artistic merit.
</P>
<P>
   The truly disheartening thing about the AFI list is that, when
it does get arty, it does it in a popularity-poll manner, too.
Sure, ``Raging Bull'' and ``Godfather II'' are anything but
easy-to-take, reassuring movies -- but even the folks who don't
like sitting through them know that they're widely acclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   What the 100 failed to leave space for were equally great but
lesser-known works, sometimes to the point of neglecting the most
quintessentially American films and filmmakers altogether. And in
the case of John Ford -- well, I'll get to that in a moment, once
I've revved up.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously missing from the list are any works by, arguably,
the three greatest practitioners of American film comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Buster Keaton, whose Civil War-set masterpiece ``The General''
was a nominee, defined in his silent comedies a uniquely U.S. view
of man as both master and servant of runaway technology. German
emigre Ernst Lubitsch not only brought continental sophistication
to our sex farces, but worked out a deft, subtle filming style that
gave visual life to sound comedy. His ``To Be or Not to Be,''
potentially the most tasteless film of the World War II era, ended
up the century's supreme monument to the importance of laughing in
the face of horror.
</P>
<P>
   And the all-but-forgotten -- by AFI voters, anyway -- Preston
Sturges was the most popular comedy maker of those dark, early-'40s
days. His films captured the brash energy and rule-breaking
impudence that, indeed, was the nation's secret weapon. Of Sturges'
half-dozen knockabout masterpieces, the one that had to be on this
list, but wasn't, is ``Sullivan's Travels,'' a cockeyed tribute to
the primal power of fun at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   The AFI list is also light on the distinctively American cycle
of film noir, those shadowy, paranoid, mid-century crime films that
expressed society's psychological responses to a rapidly changing,
endlessly threatening world. To make the AFI list, it helped if a
noir was made by a well-known director like John Huston (``The
Maltese Falcon,'' No. 23) or Wilder (No. 12 ``Sunset Boulevard''
and 38th-ranked ``Double Indemnity'').
</P>
<P>
   What's generally considered the best of the bunch, though, the
1947 ``Out of the Past,'' was made by B-movie master Jacques
Tourneur, not a household name even among the director-savvy set --
and, apparently because of that, ``Past'' seems destined to remain
an underappreciated nonclassic.
</P>
<P>
   It hardly needs to be said that all 100 films on the list were
made by white guys. You can't blame the voters too much for that;
the industry has been a virtually exclusive,
European-descended &UR;  &LR; males' club for at least eight of the 10
decades being celebrated here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you'd think that, given the chance to honor some films
that address the tortured racial relationships that are such an
integral part of our national fabric, Spike Lee's searing ``Do the
Right Thing'' could have trumped 99th-ranked ``Guess Who's Coming
to Dinner,'' a film of such condescending hokeyness it gets my vote
as the worst movie to make the top 100 cut.

AFI'S TOP 100 FILMS LIST LACKS REAL AMERICAN FEEL
</HEADLINE>
 Los Angeles: top 100 cut. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But anyone could have predicted that the list would have its
outrageous omissions and head-scratching inclusions. Within the
list, however, is the most damning evidence that this endeavor,
like any other attempt to numerically rank an entire field of
creative work, is bound to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I'm revved up now. It cannot be debated that John Ford was
the film poet of the American experience. He is not unrepresented
on the AFI list; three features made the cut. But boy, is he
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's thoroughly decent ``The Grapes of Wrath'' just missed the
top 20, but that's not the problem. Though it's a ``little guy''
film par excellence, `Wrath'' cut out the bleaker aspects of John
Steinbeck's certifiably great American novel and ended on a note of
much more simplistic uplift than the author imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Which there'd be nothing wrong with if it weren't for the fact
that ``Grapes of Wrath'' is No. 21 while way down at No. 96 -- just
three notches ahead of the egregious ``Guess Who's''! -- is Ford's
toughest, most complex and, of course, most troubling work, ``The
Searchers.'' Talk about confronting our racial problems head-on:
This all-encompassing western, just barely this side of
unforgiving, shows us in the harshest, most effective way we can
see that the only hope for our future is in growing together.
</P>
<P>
   Could an American film have a more essential message? In one of
the AFI 100 &UR;  &LR; specials coming up on the TNT cable network, Steven
Spielberg -- the director, significantly, with the most films
(five) on the list -- says there is one thing he has to do before
he makes any movie.
</P>
<P>
   He has to look at ``The Searchers.'' No. 96.

CHINA WARNS IT MAY DEVALUE ITS CURRENCY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 9th graf with update on Hong Kong market)  (ja) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ As if the falling yen were not causing enough
heartache in Asia, investors here and abroad are now fretting about
another potential crisis: the devaluation of the Chinese currency.
</P>
<P>
   China's finance minister issued a pointed warning Tuesday that
the Asian crisis could destabilize its currency. China has so far
refused to devalue the yuan, which is also called the renminbi,
even after a tide of devaluations swept through Asia last fall. But
there were new signs Tuesday that the persistent weakness in the
Japanese yen was sorely testing Beijing's resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The finance minister, Xiang Huaicheng, said in an article
Tuesday in The People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, that
China's struggle to meet its economic growth target could
``increase pressure on the stability of the renminbi.'' Later in
the day, China called on Japan to show the ``courage and wisdom''
to halt the yen's slide.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's statements were the latest in a chorus of complaints
by Chinese officials about the declining value of the yen. And they
have kindled fears throughout Asia that Beijing could be laying the
groundwork for a devaluation of its own. ``When so many Chinese
officials come out, they mean business,'' said Guonan Ma, co-head
of economic research at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong, ``If the
yen continues to fall, they will reach a breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most analysts still doubt that China plans to
devalue its currency in the short term. It is more insulated than
other Asian countries from the pressures of the global marketplace.
With President Clinton scheduled to arrive next week, China also
has compelling political reasons not to tamper with its currency.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sheer number of statements by Chinese officials has
made investors nervous. The growth rate of China's economy is
slowing, exports are declining, and as the yen drops, pressure
increases to devalue the yuan. Some analysts think that a Chinese
devaluation would kick off a new wave of tit-for-tat devaluations
around the region _ leaving Asia's currencies in tatters and its
economies in an even more precarious state.
</P>
<P>
   ``An ill-considered devaluation could start another round of
instability,'' said Miron Mushkat, director of strategy at Indocam
Asia Asset Management in Hong Kong. ``China's devaluation would
push us back to square one.''
</P>
<P>
   The renewed fears of a Chinese devaluation came on a day when
Asia's financial markets zigzagged sharply in the yen's wake. After
plunging on Monday to some of their deepest lows in years, stocks
rebounded Tuesday morning when the yen briefly strengthened against
the United States dollar. When it retreated Tuesday afternoon,
shares also dropped. At the end of the trading session, most of the
markets were down, though Hong Kong's benchmark index, the Hang
Seng, gained 0.7
</P>
<P>
   [Hong Kong stocks rose sharply on Wednesday morning, up nearly 4
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   The yen, after seesawing on rumors of Japanese government
intervention, traded at 144.56 to the U.S. dollar late in the day
here. (It settled later in New York at 143.47, an improvement from
146.15 late Monday.)
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese yuan was unchanged at 8.2798 to the dollar, but only
after China's central bank intervened to support it. China also
lowered interest rates for dollar-denominated deposits, a step that
could foreshadow a general cut in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   That would be welcomed by Chinese companies, which are battling
the now-familiar Asian affliction of slackening domestic demand,
tight credit and dwindling exports. But despite the persistent
rumors, it is far from certain that a devaluation would be a tonic
for China's mixture of economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several economists contend that it could hurt. For one,
it would seriously erode confidence in Hong Kong, which has been
struggling to shore up its own currency in recent days. Although
the Hong Kong dollar is linked to the American dollar, it is
psychologically supported by China, since last July the sovereign
authority.
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaints about the yen's value, it is also not
clear that it affects China all that much, at least not at current
levels. China and Japan have few overlapping export industries _
unlike, say, Japan and South Korea. ``People are making a link
between the yen and the yuan, but there is actually very little
link,'' said Dong Tao, a senior regional economist at Credit Suisse
First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that China actually benefited from a slumping yen in
one respect. Beijing has an estimated $40 billion in foreign debt
denominated in yen. As the yen depreciates against the dollar,
China's debt burden lightens.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a weak yen hurts China insofar as it pulls the rest
of Asia into a deeper economic mire. Asian markets, including
Japan's, account for 43 percent of China's exports. And those
countries are buying fewer Chinese-made textiles, farm products,
toys or low-cost electronics. After increasing 20 percent last
year, China's exports declined by an estimated 1.5 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in exports will make it difficult for China to meet
its goal of 8 percent economic growth in 1998. Most economists now
expect Chinese output to grow 6 percent to 7 percent this year. The
slowing growth means mushrooming unemployment, and with it, the
possibility of social unrest. Some analysts said this could
eventually force Beijing's hand.
</P>
<P>
   A key difference between China and most other Asian countries is
that its currency is not fully convertible and is therefore not
vulnerable to speculative attacks. Unlike many of its Asian
neighbors, China is also running a comfortable trade surplus and
has $140 billion in foreign reserves.
</P>
<P>
   For China, whether to devalue its currency is in part a
political decision, according to some analysts. By maintaining a
stable currency, Beijing has become an island of calm in the Asian
economic storm. Mushkat of Indocam said China had inherited the
mantle of economic leadership from a troubled Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he said the noises coming from Beijing were the sign of
a rising economic power beginning to flex its muscles. ``It's not
so much laying the groundwork but keeping their options open,'' he
said. ``China is playing the game, while Japan doesn't even
understand what the game is.''

JOHN GUTMANN, 93, PAINTER WHO BECAME A PHOTOGRAPHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Gutmann, a painter who left Germany in 1933 and reinvented
himself as an optimistic photographic chronicler of Depression-era
America, died on Friday at his home in San Francisco. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   In the America of the 1930s, Gutmann found an exuberant car
culture, a dizzying array of billboards and graffiti, a racially
diverse citizenry, music and dancing in the streets and young women
galore. He photographed them all.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his pictures are photojournalistically straightforward,
modern photojournalism having developed in Germany in the late
1920s. A fair number of his pictures also show the influence of the
avant-garde that flourished in Europe in the late 20s and early 30s
and that was to determine the course of photography for the next 50
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann's ``Elevator Garage'' (Chicago, 1936), for example, has
the distinctive bold, tilted angle and arresting cropping of
Russian Constructivism. ``Web of Light,'' in which the shadows of a
grid fall on the face and torso of a young woman, is uncannily
reminiscent of Alexander Rodchenko's ``Girl With Leica,'' but the
pictures were taken in 1934 on different continents. ``Turning to
Look'' (1935) is the sort of extreme close-up portraiture used by
avant-garde masters like Max Burchartz.
</P>
<P>
   Self-taught and unconcerned about developing a signature style,
Gutmann never stopped experimenting with ways to frame a picture.
Some of his images predate by two decades the kind of informal,
lonely-in-America pictures that Robert Frank, also an immigrant,
made famous in ``The Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The big round brass ``eye'' of the tuba held by a young player
in Gutmann's ``Indian High School Band'' (Arizona, 1937) is in
exactly the same position as the tuba in Frank's ''Political Rally,
Chicago.'' In Frank's picture the tuba obscures the player's face;
in Gutmann's, the tuba is poised like some omniscient eye above a
young man with a bandage on his somber face.
</P>
<P>
   And like Helen Levitt years later, Gutmann found fleeting
lyrical moments on the streets. ``Jitterbug'' (New Orleans, 1937)
catches the gentle grace in the movement of two dancers in a world
of their own, the young woman wearing a short skirt, white carnival
mask and hat.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gutmann always considered photo captions important, he
declined to explain his intent. ``Ambiguity,'' he once wrote, ``is
an essence of life. In this sense I am not interested in trying
desperately to make art, but I am interested in relating to the
marvelous extravagance of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutmann was born in 1905 in Breslau, Germany. He studied
painting at the State Academy of Arts and Crafts in that city, and,
after receiving a bachelor's degree in 1927, moved to Berlin, where
he earned a master's degree at the State Institute for Higher
Education. For artists, the late 1920s in Berlin was a gloriously
heady time _ a time of Cubism, Futurism, Constructivism,
Expressionism and Surrealism _ and photography was an integral part
of the avant-garde.
</P>
<P>
   But with the Nazis taking control, Gutmann, who came from a
wealthy Jewish family, was unable to exhibit his paintings or get a
teaching job. A friend recommended that he go to San Francisco to
make a living as a photographer. Before leaving Berlin in late
1933, Gutmann bought a Rolleiflex and shot three test rolls of
film. He also managed to get a contract from Presse-Foto in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he signed up with the New York City picture
agency Pix Inc., which placed his work in magazines like Life, The
Saturday Evening Post, Look and Time. In 1936, Gutmann also began
teaching art at San Francisco State College. A decade later, he
founded the creative photography program there, one of the first in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Gutmann served with the U.S. Office of War
Information in China, Burma and India. After he retired from San
Francisco State College in 1973, he devoted much of his time to
editing and reprinting his photographs for exhibitions and
publications. In 1984, ``The Restless Decade,'' a book of his
1930's pictures, which he considered his best work, was published
by Harry N. Abrams; it has been reissued in paperback.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1980, the Fraenkel Gallery in San Francisco, which
represents Gutmann, has held regular exhibitions of his
photographs. In 1989, a major retrospective of his work, ``Beyond
the Document,'' traveled from the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art to the Museum of Modern Art in New York and to the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   No immediate family members survive.

RICHARD L. ROSENTHAL, UTILITIES ENTREPRENEUR, DIES AT 82 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard L. Rosenthal, who took control of a small troubled
company called Citizens Utilities after World War II and built it
into a powerhouse of profit that made millionaires of many
investors who stuck with him until he retired in 1989, died on
Saturday. He was 82 years old.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Hinda, said on Tuesday that he died at home in
Stamford, Conn., after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal not only made a mark as a builder of profitable
companies like Citizens Utilities, which has its headquarters in
Stamford, he was also known as a supporter of the arts.
</P>
<P>
   He established the Richard and Hinda Rosenthal Foundation in
1948 to give cash awards to writers, painters and young film
directors. Brian De Palma and Martin Scorsese were among the
recipients when they were still making their way as young
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who have been fortunate in society should make a
real effort to put something back,'' Rosenthal said in a 1983
interview. ``I don't mean just money, but energy and thought _ the
whole panoply of one's intellectual capacity and experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal stood taller than 6 feet, with reddish hair and a
craggy face framed by dark horn-rimmed glasses. He reveled in the
limelight and tried his hand at acting. He had a small part,
playing a judge, in a film called ``Bad Boys,'' directed by his
son, Rick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reasonably may be said that I have been too vainglorious,''
he said in a 1981 Forbes magazine interview. ``But it reasonably
may be said that we have fulfilled what my objectives have been.''
</P>
<P>
   His career was not a story of rags to riches through hard work.
It was of an ambitious young man who, after the Depression,
concluded that success required knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal graduated summa cum laude from New York University
with a Bachelor of Science degree and then went on to graduate
studies. ``We were deadly serious about studying because we knew we
had to know something _ and prove it _ in order to get any kind of
job after leaving school,'' he once said of his graduating class.
</P>
<P>
   He used his analytical abilities to land a $75-a-week job at
Wertheim &AMP; Co., a Wall Street investment firm. While there he
developed a research technique that involved traveling to study a
business firsthand by interviewing management and employees instead
of relying on material provided by companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some friends on Wall Street were impressed with his abilities.
They formed an investment group and asked Rosenthal, then 29, to
buy control of some companies. He focused on utilities because he
considered their managements ineffective and thought they failed to
exploit growth opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal and the group acquired three small companies: Citizens
Utilities, in 1946; Michigan Gas and Electric, in the Upper
Peninsula of Michigan, in 1947, and the New York Water Service
Corp., a water utility, in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   During most of his career at Citizens Utilities he held the
positions of president, chief executive and chairman.
</P>
<P>
   His approach was to be highly diversified by region to better
ride out economic cycles and not be under the influence of
regulators from a few states.
</P>
<P>
   He acquired more than 40 companies to build Citizens Utilities.
Its revenues rose from $2.4 million to more than $300 million when
he stepped down in 1989. By then Citizens Utilities had about
460,000 customers in more than 500 communities in 12 states.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal also found an innovative way to raise money for his
ventures. Instead of paying out most of the earnings in dividends,
as most utilities do, he issued a special type of stock in which
shareholders got stock as dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Investors enjoyed one of the highest annual rates of return in
the utility industry during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most utility executives, he rarely built new power plants
to meet rising demand for electricity in the many fast-growing
Western areas into which he expanded. Instead he bought power from
other producers.
</P>
<P>
   To manage the widespread businesses, he sought executives who
could operate independently. He kept a tight rein, however,
requiring them to submit weekly reports, and he visited them
periodically.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal also built the New York Water Service Corp. into a
diversified company called Utilities and Industries, which owned

ANGELS MOVE INTO FIRST PLACE

<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels will welcome back manager Terry Collins
tonight with the best present he could have hoped for _ first
place.
</P>
<P>
   With Tuesday night's 3-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners, the
Angels took over the lead in the American League West by one-half
game over the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Collins completed his eight-game suspension Tuesday night for
the June 2 fight with Kansas City. When he began the suspension,
the Angels trailed the Rangers by three games. After going 6-2
during Collins' absence, the Angels grabbed the division lead for
the first time since April 9.
</P>
<P>
   In Collins' place, bench coach Joe Maddon, pitching coach Marcel
Lachemann and third-base coach Larry Bowa worked together and made
all the in-game decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys in the dugout did a tremendous job,'' said Angels
center fielder Jim Edmonds, who gave the Angels a 2-0 lead in the
first inning with a two-run single. ``They let us play and have
fun, and it showed. It's a credit to the coaching staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddon was the one who formally made all the moves, filled out
the lineup cards and made pitching changes. He said he enjoyed the
past eight games, but he's not reluctant to give up the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's not my team,'' Maddon said. ``I'm just glad I didn't
screw it up while I was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just playing well when this (suspensions) all came
down. We continued to play well. This whole time was just a
continuation of what we've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got another strong outing from starting pitcher Jason
Dickson (7-4), who gave up two runs and seven hits in seven innings
to get the win. Most important for Dickson, he didn't walk a
batter. After starting the season 1-4, Dickson has won six
consecutive decisions, including four in a row as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels bullpen _ Mike Holtz, Shigetoshi Hasegawa and Troy
Percival _ combined to throw two perfect innings to close it out.
Percival pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to record his league-leading 21st
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels got all the offense they would need in the first
three innings off Mariners starter Bill Swift (6-4) and reliever
Bob Wells. Edmonds had a two-run single in the first inning off
Swift, who had to leave the game after two innings with a bruised
chest muscle. He was hit by a line drive off the bat of Justin
Baughman in the second. Matt Walbeck drove in the Angels' third run
with a single in the third off Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels pitchers did the rest and the team moved into first
place. However, there was no celebration in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the date today? June 16?'' Edmonds asked. ``We've been
there before, and out of it. You can't worry about it; it comes and
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mariners have watched helplessly as their season
has fallen apart before their eyes. Coming off a division title,
the Mariners were supposed to contend for the AL West title but
instead are now 12 games behind the Angels and in last place. The
problems include a horrible bullpen, the Randy Johnson situation
and losing Jay Buhner (knee surgery) for two months. Nothing seems
to be getting any better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total (expletive) mess,'' Mariners manager Lou Piniella
said. ``We can't catch and we can't throw. You just do the best you
can and don't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Mariners management has said it won't trade Johnson, the
club seems eager to make whatever changes it can.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a number of areas we'd like to make changes,''
Mariners general manager Woody Woodward told the Seattle Times.
``Up to now we've been letting the guys on the roster try to pull
this together, and it hasn't been working. If I could do something
now to shake up the club, I'd love to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, though, say they aren't about to take the Mariners
lightly, last place or not, having seen the Mariners rally from a
13-game deficit in August of 1995 to win the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still a talented team,'' Tim Salmon said. ``We've seen
them come back from 13 games before. I don't put it past them.
They're definitely a team you can't take lightly. You still go
after them like they're a first-place team.''

RED WINGS WIN 2ND CONSECUTIVE STANLEY CUP 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First, his Detroit Red Wings teammates placed the
Stanley Cup _ 35 inches tall, 35 pounds, its base filled with 2,225
names, including his own _on his knee. Then they got behind
Vladimir Konstantinov's wheelchair and gave it a gentle push to
begin a slow parade of triumph across the ice before thousands of
cheering fans.
</P>
<P>
   Every spring, the tournament championship of the National Hockey
League is celebrated with a procession around the rink, but none
has included such poignant joy. There was a wide smile on
Konstantinov's face, a fat cigar in his hand, a team hat on his
head, a red jersey on his chest and tears in many eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantinov, a star of the Red Wings' championship team last
spring, suffered severe brain damage last June, six days after
Detroit won its first cup after a 42-year drought. Also seriously
injured in that limousine accident was Sergei Manatsakanov, a team
masseur. The injuries and the recovery of the two men provided an
undercurrent of an emotional and, ultimately, successful season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, we were told these guys might not live,''
Detroit's captain, Steve Yzerman, said, referring to Konstantinov
and Manatsakanov. Giving Konstantinov the cup first, Yzerman said,
``was the appropriate thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   They won on Tuesday night by 4-1 over the Washington Capitals at
the MCI Center, sweeping the final round of the tournament in four
consecutive games. Last season, they won in four over Philadelphia.
In the last four seasons, all the cup finals have ended with
four-game sweeps. The Wings are the first team since the 1992
Pittsburgh Penguins to win two consecutive post-season
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman didn't get any goals or assists on Tuesday night. Two
goals were scored by Doug Brown, and the others were by Martin
Lapointe and Larry Murphy. Sergei Fedorov had two assists. But
Yzerman, who led the tournament with 24 points, won the Conn Smythe
trophy as most valuable player of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Also taking a bow was Scotty Bowman, the coach, who won his
eighth cup ring as a coach to go with one other earned as a
front-office executive in Pittsburgh. Bowman has tied Toe Blake,
his former mentor in Montreal, with eight championships as a coach.
At the age of 64, Bowman said he was not sure if he would return
next season to try to break the record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough decision,'' Bowman said. ``I've got
to leave some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman first coached in the finals 30 years ago, with the St.
Louis Blues, losing in four consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   As most members of the team did, Bowman spoke of Konstantinov.
``Everyone knows what it was for,'' Bowman said. ``That's what we
all wanted to do. We knew he was at the game. We had a tough
season, getting over the accident. Everybody said, we're not going
to let those guys down.'' Konstantinov sat in a private box about
20 rows up from the net that the Wings shot at for the first and
third periods.
</P>
<P>
   During a timeout, early in the third period, he stood up with
help to acknowledge the cheers of the fans, many of whom chanted:
``Vlad-die! Vlad-die! Vlad-die!'' Although it was a road game for
the Wings, the building was filled with thousands of fans clad in
red-and-white clothing. The Wings are a core franchise from the
NHL's ``Old Six'' era, and many of their Michigan-bred fans have
migrated across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   When Konstantinov stood, the players on the Detroit bench took
notice and acknowledged him by tapping their sticks on the ice.
Fedorov, one of the ``Russian Five'' who led Detroit to its
championship last season, spoke of the emotion then and afterward.
``When I saw Vladdie on the ice, I couldn't believe my eyes,''
Fedorov said. ``He was a happy kid.'' Fedorov spoke of the
destruction of Konstantinov's ability to process information and
how he worried if Konstantinov would grow weary quickly. He knelt
down beside him and talked softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Vladdie, are you a little tired?''' Fedorov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was. I said, `You sure?' He said, `No, I'm not
sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Fedorov noticed Konstantinov waving his hand,
signaling two fingers for two Stanley Cup championships. Satisfied
that his friend was in fine form, Fedorov left to join other areas
of the celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very inspirational to see him in the building,''
Fedorov said. ``Our thoughts are with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman said of Konstantinov, ``He was never forgotten, but
never used as motivational ploy.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was the only game of the series that did not end in a
one-goal decision. Chris Osgood, the Detroit goalie, stopped 30 of
31 shots and said he had no hard feelings to fans or journalists
who have questioned his abilities after giving up remarkably soft
goals in each of the four rounds. ``I don't hold any grudges,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   So did the Capitals, who made their first appearance in the
finals in their 24-year history. They made the game close only
briefly, early in the second period, when Brian Bellows cut the
Detroit lead to 2-1. Ron Wilson, their coach, told why he stayed on
the bench to watch the Red Wings celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of hockey,'' he said. ``You want to see the Stanley
Cup up close and dream that next year it's going to be our team
holding it above our heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman spoke of how Konstantinov's Russian teammates _ Fedorov,
Slava Fetisov, Igor Larionov and Slava Kozlov _ kept track of their
comrades' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a day that went by that they didn't phone,''
Bowman said. ``Those four in particular felt such a part of
them.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the Red Wings have five players from Russia and
three from Sweden, Bowman said: ``Our Europeans have really
integrated; that's what makes a team.''

THE TRANSFORMATION OF CAPTAIN YZERMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By ED WILLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ During the course of the Stanley Cup finals,
Brendan Shanahan said that hockey teams _ like pets with their
owners _ begin to resemble their leader over time.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, then the strange and wonderful relationship
between Steve Yzerman and the Detroit Red Wings came full circle on
Tuesday night. The Red Wings, who were regarded as the classic
can't-win-the-big-one team through the early 1990s, won their
second consecutive Stanley Cup on Tuesday night, finishing a
four-game sweep of the Washington Capitals with a 4-1 victory. And
Yzerman, who was once regarded as the classic great player who
can't win the big one, is now viewed as the National Hockey
League's most respected leader after winning the Conn Smythe trophy
as the playoffs' most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, who was named captain of the rebuilding Red Wings as a
21-year-old in the 1986-87 season, captured the first major trophy
of his starry 15-season NHL career when he was handed the Smythe
trophy on Tuesday night after a dominating and defining playoff
performance. Yzerman led all playoff scorers with 24 points on 6
goals and 18 assists, finished the post-season at plus 10 and
manufactured key offensive plays in each of the Red Wings' first
three victories over the Caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty exhausted,'' Yzerman said. ``I haven't had time to
sit on the couch and just watch TV for a long time. It's been a
long season.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm thrilled to have my name on the trophy with so many
great players. When I came into the league, I don't think anyone
knew how to spell my name or pronounce it. I'm proud the Yzerman
name is going on the trophy. This is very gratifying.''
</P>
<P>
   And well deserved, according to Caps Coach Ron Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scores points, he kills penalties, and he plays the power
play,'' Wilson said. ``He was their most consistent and important
player. He deserves the award.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman was at his best in Game 2 of the final when the Wings
came back from 3-1 and 4-2 third-period deficits to record a 5-4
overtime victory that changed the complexion of the series. His
two-goal performance also followed some rough treatment at the
hands of Caps center Dale Hunter in the opening game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took quite a beating,'' said Wings Coach Scotty Bowman.
``He's always geared up, but that got him geared up to beat them
with his stick and skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give a lot of credit to Steve Yzerman.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way with Yzerman, whose career in Detroit
underwent wild fluctuations before he finally settled into his
current role as the team's governing spirit.
</P>
<P>
   In six seasons from 1987 to 1993, Yzerman averaged 122 points a
season and was generally regarded as the game's third-best
offensive center behind Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux. But the
Wings' success, especially in the playoffs, did not equal Yzerman's
individual success.
</P>
<P>
   When Bowman took over the team in 1993-94, the Wings were a
talented, explosive offensive team that was also too soft for the
playoff grind. Bowman eventually changed the makeup of the team,
transforming the Red Wings into a gritty squad capable of playing a
strong two-way game. And critical to that makeover was the
transformation of Yzerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do anything specific,'' Yzerman said when asked about
his leadership style. ``I don't think, `What do I do to lead this
team today?' We just kind of go out and play.''
</P>
<P>
   But other members of the Wings see Yzerman's role differently.
Shanahan was asked whether the Wings' second cup and Yzerman's
performance moved the team captain into the special ring occupied
by Gretzky and Mark Messier as the game's greatest leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to compare him to anyone specifically,''
Shanahan said. ``Each player is unique. But I'll just say this.
I'll say he's now one of the great captains of all time.'' &QL;

YZERMAN NAMED PLAYOFF MVP 
</HEADLINE>
 SMYTHE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He has been on the Stanley Cup champions the past
two years, but as far as individual honors go, Red Wings captain
Steve Yzerman had won only the 1988-89 Lester Pearson Award, which
goes to the top NHL performer as selected by his fellow players.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday night Yzerman added another award. The 33-year-old
center was unanimously chosen winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as
playoff MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has had a distinguished 15-year career, Yzerman didn't
achieve a great deal of recognition until last year. Ironically,
that recognition comes as his offensive numbers are diminishing.
After being strictly an offensive gun from 1987-88 through 1992-93
_ when he had more than 100 points each season _ Yzerman has become
a strong, dependable two-way player.
</P>
<P>
   This year he had 69 points in the regular season, 24 of them
goals. In the playoffs, which concluded Tuesday when Detroit
finished its sweep of the Washington Capitals, Yzerman had 6 goals
and 24 points in 22 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely just as good this year,'' said Yzerman. ``We
were able to relax a little bit more and enjoy the whole ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we won last year, I think we all kind of said to
ourselves, `If we never win again, we'd just be happy.' But as soon
as the playoffs come around, you can tell every guy wanted to win
every bit as much as before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to have my name on a trophy that has some of the
greatest names in hockey. When I came into the league, I don't
think anybody really knew how to spell my name or pronounce it, so
I'm very proud of the fact that the Yzerman name is going on a
trophy that will be a part of hockey for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, like Bruins captain Ray Bourque, would like to have a
career that spans 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last season, I thought about how much longer I wanted to
play,'' said Yzerman. ``This is my 15th season in the league and I
want to play 20. Right now I'm having the greatest time in hockey
in my life, so I can't possibly think about not playing again. I'm
glad the season is over but I look forward to coming back and
trying again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman is exhausted after a season that seemed as if it would
never end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been difficult, with the Olympic Games in the middle of
the season,'' he said. ``It seemed like once the season started, it
never stopped. You never got a chance to catch your breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playoffs are incredibly draining. I'm looking forward to
taking it easy for a while. It's been a draining year, but
obviously, it's been an enjoyable year.''

ANGELS TOP MARINERS, TAKE WEST LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Two of the best things going for the Mariners
couldn't prevent them from absorbing another loss Tuesday night on
a rocky journey through California.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui made an error. Bill Swift lost a game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariner news only gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the leaderboard changed at the top of the
American League West, the bottom stayed the same. The Anaheim
Angels took over first place ahead of the Texas Rangers and buried
the Mariners a little deeper in the basement with a 3-2 victory
before 27,952 fans at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, the Mariner staff leader in wins with six, absorbed the
most pain in Seattle's ninth loss in 12 games against
California-based teams, suffering a bruised right pectoral muscle
when clobbered by a line drive in the second inning. Although his
status is listed as day-to-day, the veteran sounded as though his
next turn is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you get hit in the shoulder area, it's going to be
stiff and sore,'' he said. ``The last time I got hit by a line
drive was in '86 when Gary Gaetti hit one off my forehead. That
didn't hurt and I didn't miss a turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Angels second baseman Justin Baughman hit a line
drive up the middle and Swift barely had time to react. He ducked,
turned his head and put his glove up for protection. The ball hit
the right side of Swift's chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw him a changeup and he hit a changeup back to me,''
Swift said. ``It wasn't thrown that hard and didn't hit me that
hard. I turned away, but not far enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The stunned pitcher retrieved the ball between the mound and
first base, underhanded a throw to Segui and continued toward the
Mariner dugout, being met by manager Lou Piniella and trainer Rick
Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   Swift shrugged off the pain, returned to the mound and finished
the inning. But after watching the right-hander throw several
warmup tosses before the third inning, Piniella went to the mound,
put his arm around Swift's shoulders and made a pitching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to stay in, but you could tell it was bothering him
because he was pushing the ball,'' Piniella said. ``It was pretty
obvious and you don't want to take any chances (of risking further
injury).''
</P>
<P>
   Swift said he tried to continue, but he could feel tightness
developing and returned to the clubhouse for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty stiff and sore,'' he said. ``I was even having
trouble shaving.''
</P>
<P>
   He will have more treatment Wednesday and be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   As poorly as the Mariners have played defense this season, Segui
was the exception. He had no errors through the first 69 games.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has one.
</P>
<P>
   Segui misplayed Darin Erstad's inning-opening grounder in the
first and ex-Mariner Dave Hollins doubled to right. Jim Edmonds
then delivered a two-run single to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad's run was the 31st unearned run allowed by the Mariners
and Segui's error was Seattle's league-high 61st.
</P>
<P>
   Even a potential Gold Glove winner isn't immune to mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball took a little hop and came up on me, but I should
have had it,'' Segui said. ``It was about the easiest play I had
all night, but I knew (Erstad) runs real well and I turned to get
in position to make the throw before making the throw instead of
getting in front of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed it up and put Swifty in a bad situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The bobble forced Segui to hold the runner on base and open a
hole between first and second. Hollins found it with a line drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one is on base, I'm playing back and that ball is hit
right at me,'' Segui said.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, knocking the Rangers out of first place for the
first time since April 7, scored the eventual game-winning run in
the third inning off Bob Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle sliced the gap to one run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   After Segui's double put runners on second and third with one
out, Edgar Martinez hit a run-scoring infield out and Glenallen
Hill scored another with his second double of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's drive off winner Jason Dickson missed going over the
fence by inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just aren't going our way,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   But until the sixth, another familiar Mariner problem
re-emerged: the inability to get hits with runners in scoring
position. Seattle had runners on second base in each of the first
four innings and none advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the ball hard, but right at people,'' Piniella said.
``And when we had people on base early in the game, we couldn't get
the key hits.''

U.S. TOOK STEP BACKWARD AGAINST GERMANY
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Tab Ramos was just one of 22 clueless Americans eight
years ago on an adventure they had no hope to comprehend. Thrown
into the World Cup the United States' first since 1950 the Yanks
arrived in Italy as tourists, as rank amateurs taking on seasoned
pros. They found themselves headed home, humiliated, just two weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just walked on the field with our cameras, really,'' Ramos
remembers. ``Let's be honest, we had a team that didn't belong in
the World Cup. We never thought we'd go to the World Cup. The
United States hadn't been to the World Cup in 40 years, and here
for some reason we qualified, and we were like, `How did we do
this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's a memory that popped into his head Monday night as he
looked on in disgust as the Americans, now professionals with World
Cup aspirations, were overpowered by Germany in their World Cup
opener. He couldn't abide the hesitation in the United States'
play, the manner with which they backed down to the Germans in the
first 45 minutes of the clash at Parc des Princes.
</P>
<P>
   And it reminded him of the dark ages just eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alexi (Lalas), Marcelo (Balboa) and myself were on the bench
watching the first half,'' he said when it was over. ``It looked
like we'd gone backward, and we looked more our '90 team than our
'94 team, and that's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Balboa, too, was part of that team; Lalas was in the stands, his
face painted red, white and blue, his dreams of Cup glory still
four years off. They didn't enjoy what they saw Monday night,
either, but it was Ramos who felt he must speak out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can lose to Germany, 2-0, 10 years from now,'' he said,
``but what's disappointing is that the impression we left is that
we were a team hoping not to have a lot of goals scored against us.
That's not what we came here for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here to win the World Cup, because we know that's
not going to happen. But we want to show we've improved, and we
didn't do a very good job of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind that are arguable. Some, Reyna included,
believe Coach Steve Sampson left too many experienced players
Ramos, Balboa and Lalas included on the bench. Others, among them
Sampson, think the Yanks reacted poorly after surrendering an early
goal and couldn't bounce back. Whatever the reason, it wasn't a
pretty sight; aside from the first 15 minutes or so of the second
half, the United States had no business being on the field with
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it was necessarily the lack of World Cup
experience or taking of an early goal that led us to play with
`timid' play,'' Sampson said. ``It is important against Iran (on
Sunday) that we do inject a little more offense, a little more
experience. It's important we show the physical side of our game
and impose our game on the Iranians. That's essential from the very
first second. Can't afford to make that mistake twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Ramos: ``If we don't play any better against Iran, we won't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the end of the Americans' Cup. A victory over the
Iranians is essential to keeping its second-round hopes alive, and
some sort of positive result a win or a tie; we won't know which
until after Sunday also is necessary against Yugoslavia on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos hopes to make an impact against Iran. Sampson has told him
he'll start in that game, probably in place of Ernie Stewart.
Frankie Hejduk, who nearly pulled the Americans even with a fine
header in the 53rd minute, also will be in the lineup, if one hears
the messages Sampson is sending; he'll step in for Mike Burns, as
he did at halftime on Monday. The other potential change from the
first-game lineup would be Roy Wegerle in place of Eric Wynalda,
but Sampson said Tuesday he has not yet made a determination on a
starting forward.
</P>
<P>
   Might makes right
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the first minute how Germany planned to
neutralize the Americans take midfielder Claudio Reyna out of the
match and their plan worked to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna, whom the Germans were familiar with from his work with
Bundesliga straggler VfL Wolfsburg, received a blow to the kidney
from Jens Jeremies just seconds into Monday's clash, and the 1860
Munich midfielder beat up on Reyna the rest of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our clear tactical intention, because we know he is
the key to their team,'' German forward Juergen Klinsmann said.
``The intention was for Jens to make life difficult for him, and we
felt that tactic worked successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna said he wasn't surprised by the attention he got from
Jeremies, whom he described as ``overly aggressive'' whenever he
plays for 1860 or for the German squad.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest criticism of Reyna, widely considered the greatest
player the United States has produced, is that he doesn't like
physical play. Expect the Iranians and Yugoslavs to treat him in a
similar manner.
</P>
<P>
   Rally, er, shorts?
</P>
<P>
   Winger Frankie Hejduk, the surfer-turned-soccer star who made
the biggest impact for the Americans on Monday, took a page from
baseball superstition and twisted it in an effort to overcome the
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Since baseball players will often turn their caps backward in an
effort to spur their team in a comeback what's known as ``rally
caps'' former UCLA star Hejduk thought it might be wise to do
something similar. When he learned he'd be coming on for the second
half, he dropped his shorts, turned them around, and made sure they
were on backward before taking the field.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, he replied, in quintessential Frankiespeak: ``Rally
cap, bro, rally cap.''
</P>
<P>
   He says it has worked several times with the Tampa Bay Mutiny,
but its failure to inspire anything more than one superb chance on
Monday has made Hejduk swear off the ``rally shorts'' idea for the
future,
</P>
<P>
   A bad sign
</P>
<P>
   Eric Wynalda, who didn't manage even a shot in 63 minutes as the
Americans' striker, says he knew things were going wrong almost
from then start.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first couple minutes, I was listening to (German
defenders) Christian (Woerns) and Juergen (Kohler) and Olaf (Thon)
talk to each other,'' he said. ``They were very optimistic. They
were saying, `Go forward, I've got him, I'll stay with him, you
go.' I understand German, so I'm talking back to them, saying,
`Ooh, that's not a good idea, you don't want to leave me here
alone.'
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they scored, Olaf said to Juergen, `Where are you
going? It's 1-0. You stay here with me.' Suddenly, instead of
having 11/2 guys marking me, I had four. They're not dummies. They
weren't going to take any chances. And they sure as hell weren't
going to let me have space to run. They're up 1-0 eight minutes
into a game. If anybody knows how to go into a defensive shell,
it's the Germans, the most organized team in the world. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``That early goal really put a damper on things. What we really
wanted was to frustrate the Germans into forcing the issue, which
would open things up for me and Claudio and Ernie (Stewart). When
they got ahead early, they were able to seal it up, and they just
kept squeezing it tighter and tighter and tighter as the game went
on.''

GREAT DEBATE: WOODS OR DUVAL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Stand back, please, while the country's greatest
golfer makes his way to the first tee. That includes you, too,
Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   As the 98th U.S. Open unfolds Thursday at The Olympic Club, the
ground has shifted, something that happens a lot in this town. The
guy with the goatee and wraparound sunglasses belongs inside the
ropes, not outside them. In fact, put David Duval _ not Tiger Woods
_ at the top of golf's leader board.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 months, since the previous U.S. Open at Congressional
Country Club in Bethesda, Md., Duval has ruled the game like no
other. Check the win column. Check his bank statements.
</P>
<P>
   Duval doesn't ask, ``Are you ready for me?'' Instead, he has
slipped past everyone in a quiet, methodical fashion, posting five
victories since October. That's more than double anyone else,
including Tiger, who has two. Duval has collected earnings of
$2,845,249 since Congressional, a full million more than Mr. Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Duval, 27, a Jacksonville, Fla., native and son of a Senior PGA
Tour player, carefully sidesteps the issue of whether he is golf's
top player now. But he didn't dismiss it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair for me to answer that,'' he says. ``If
I say yes, then I am arrogant. If I say no, I have no confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have no problem sizing up Duval's newfound stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been kicking everybody's rear end,'' said Gary McCord,
CBS-TV golf analyst and part-time PGA Tour player.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Duval's absolute brilliance won't last forever. Golf
never permits anyone to get too comfortable or too cocky. The
latest reminder of this came when Woods hit his plateau, posting
merely reasonable success after an astonishing pro debut.
</P>
<P>
   What Duval has done is tantalize us with the possibilities of
returning golf to its heyday _ a stage for two heavyweights to
separate themselves from the PGA Tour masses on a regular basis and
clearly divide the galleries. Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus did
this. So did Byron Nelson and Ben Hogan. Match play.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s had no such arrangement, nor have the '90s so far,
forcing golf followers to settle for man against the game, the
course or the elements. Which is not nearly as much fun.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 23, and Duval have the shots to get this done and slip
away from the rest of golf's enormously talented 20-something
players, a group that includes Justin Leonard, Ernie Els, Phil
Mickelson and Jim Furyk. Since last year's U.S. Open, Woods and
Duval have played in 14 tournaments together. Head to head, they
are 7-7. In majors, they are 2-2. In 13{ events together (Duval
missed one cut), four strokes separate them, in Duval's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congressional, Duval has 10 top-10 finishes, Woods nine.
Duval has played 38 rounds in the 60s, Woods 30. Duval's best round
is 62 and his worst is 77; Woods' high and low are 63 and 77.
</P>
<P>
   Woods carries an edge in length, averaging seven more yards per
drive (295.6) than Duval in 1998. Yet Duval leads the tour in
putting (1.705 per hole) and birdies (4.61 per round) this season.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a green jacket _ and he had an arm in one
sleeve last April before finishing second to Mark O'Meara _ Duval
has done it all. He just hasn't let you know it. There have been no
leg-splitting, fist-pumping gyrations, no commercials, few magazine
covers.
</P>
<P>
   Duval chooses to go about his work without the sideshow. This
seems to satisfy him. This seems to be his only drawback in the
public's mind. But that's OK. Nicklaus, when initially compared to
the swash-buckling Palmer, was said to be about as dull as watching
a fairway being mowed. Duval suffers from a similar perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is a shy person and America likes its sports heroes
complete,'' said Peter Kostis, renowned instructor and CBS-TV
analyst. ``People want the bright smile, the tongue hanging out.
America wants the ancillary things from its sports stars. David
hasn't done that. He's going to come in behind other guys, slightly
behind, because of the charisma factor. But he's a helluva
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods had his normal circus-like following Tuesday during a
morning practice round at Olympic, while Duval had far fewer fans
watching him prepare. It's human nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``David has played great,'' Tom Watson said. ``But the fans
still want to see Tiger Woods. It's been that way in the history of
the game. People gravitate to people with the names.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players remain just as adamant as the fans over the game's
top player. Five recent wins make no difference to them either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Tiger, because he's No. 1 in the world rankings,'' said
Lee Westwood, considered Europe's top player. The IMG Sony world
golf rankings, a compilation of wins and top finishes over a
two-year span, list Woods first and Duval sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' smugness and confidence seem to greatly overshadow the
workmanlike Duval. And it starts at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young players like David Duval are the ones who understand
how gifted Tiger really is and the ones who recognize his true
skill as a golfer,'' said Tiger's father, Earl. ``They do not have
the talent Tiger has. But the good thing about golf is there is
more than one way to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Duval was effectively humbled before he could think of
getting a big head. A four-time All-American at Georgia Tech and
1993 college player of the year, he failed to earn his tour card
and spent the '93 and '94 seasons on the Nike Tour. Once on the big
tour, he suffered through the indignation of several near-misses,
finishing as a tournament runner-up seven times before his
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Duval keeps himself well grounded. While Woods bounces from
restaurant openings to photo shoots away from the course, the
Floridian goes skiing or surfing off the beaten track. He arrived
at the Open after a week of fishing in Montana. He'll leave the
glitz for Woods, but he remains competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago in Ohio, Duval looked out at a crowded room of
reporters and kidded that they must have been expecting Tiger.
Then, as if acknowledging his newly acquired star status, he had
another observation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nobody left,'' he said slyly.

   TOKYO _ As the yen continues to fall, experts worldwide say it
is due to severe loss of confidence in the Japanese economy. In
Japan, the experts say it is Nippon uri, or the selling out of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason, surely, is the extraordinary situation
surrounding interest rates in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   With the official discount rate stuck at 0.5 percent, and many
depositors in Japan getting less than 1 percent interest for their
money, it was inevitable that they would eventually begin to look
abroad. When they did, it was inevitable that the yen would begin
to weaken.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who keeps his money in yen is losing not just the
interest spread but also the exchange gains, a total of well over
10 percent per annum for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is not the yen collapse we see today but the
absence of collapse years ago when it was already clear that the
economy would not recover quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Timidity, misguided patriotism and optimism for early recovery
were the main reasons why most Japanese kept their money in Japan.
It has taken the best part of five years, and some easing of the
rules on sending money abroad, for depositors to get smart.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than loss of confidence or the selling out of Japan, what
we see now is a belated understanding of how foreign exchange
markets work.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly with the economy generally. It has long been obvious
that no economy, not even Japan's, could stand a sudden collapse of
the grossly inflated asset values built up during Japan's bubble
economy of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, once the collapse got under way there was every chance
that it would spiral. Even interest rates at close to zero would
not stop the rot.
</P>
<P>
   The one person to realize this was the then-prime minister and
Keynesian economist Kiichi Miyazawa, back in 1992. But, as he said
on a recent television program, his proposal then for the
government to step in decisively to rescue bank loans already
turning sour because of collapsing asset values was derided on
every side, and by the business community especially.
</P>
<P>
   Right through until very recently, the business and other
``experts'' _ many heavily influenced by imported
Reaganite/Thatcherite policies _ told us variously that all would
be well if Japan simply bankrupted inefficient financial
institutions, embraced full deregulation, privatized the post
office system, moved to small government, reformed its
administration, increased the ratio of indirect to direct taxes,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   It was similar to the way many in the West used the 1980s
recessions to push their own private agendas.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, we had the unbelievably foolish attempt late last
year to introduce an item that had long been high on the Finance
Ministry agenda, namely, a long-term program of severe fiscal
restraint _ at precisely the moment when the economy needed fiscal
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. experts were urging their favorite agenda item,
massive tax cuts _ in a nation where high savings propensity and
current pessimism guarantee that such cuts will simply end up as
extra savings, which is the last thing needed by Japan's
demand-starved economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the politicians have at last begun to stop
listening to these experts. Firm action to expand government
spending and rescue the banking system is at last being promised.
</P>
<P>
   These moves may be in time to rescue the economy. But things
would have been much better, for Japan and the rest of Asia, if
they had come in 1992. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Aching back and all, Fred Couples on Tuesday
said he likes his chances to win the 98th U.S. Open. In his bag, he
carries course familiarity. He might be 800 miles from his
birthplace, but he feels at home at The Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of Seattle,'' Couples said after touring the
difficult, tree-lined course.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old golfer, still fighting the back stiffness that
has plagued him much of the past four years, spent long sessions on
the driving range before and after a five-hour practice round. He
was all business, rifling iron shot after iron shot toward the
ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Couples paused long enough to ponder an August return to
Seattle for the PGA Championship, the likely discontinuation of his
hometown charity tournament after three years and life after his
father's death.
</P>
<P>
   Couples expects his PGA appearance at Sahalee Country Club to be
highly emotional, one marking his first competitive appearance
before friends and relatives. Tenative plans have him arriving
early for the major tournament and playing a few extra rounds in
Redmond, then staying over and relaxing with those closest to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to go play in Seattle,'' he said. ``I'm very
lucky. I could have gone my whole career and never played in my
hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples is counting on future playing trips to his old haunts as
well, with the new TPC Course at Snoqualmie Ridge expected to
attract a PGA Tour stop as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   He is committed to a newly created world tour event in 1999,
which will prevent him from playing in the restart of ``The Seattle
Open,'' slated for a late August date when contracts are signed.
But he has every intention of playing in the event otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would definitely play,'' he said. ``I wouldn't be sitting in
Dallas (where he lives) with a Seattle tournament going on.''
</P>
<P>
   That being said, he expects his ``Fred Couples Invitational,'' a
two-day charity event held at Overlake and Inglewood country clubs,
to have run its course.
</P>
<P>
   Couples, his hair graying around the edges, said he has found an
inner peace which comes from moving on from personal tragedy and
playing well again. His father, Tom, died from cancer last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things go good, I try not to wear that too much on my
shoulder;. when they go bad, I'm the same way,'' he said. ``But
people are going to find out. You try to keep it semi-secret that
your father is sick and two days later everyone knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peace comes from playing good golf. On the other hand, if I
was 150th on money list and struggling, I would be miserable. When
doing anything well, you're going to have more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Couples enters the Open coming off a win at The Memorial two
weeks ago, his second of the season. He has runner-up finishes at
the Masters and Byron Nelson, two events that easily could have
been victories.
</P>
<P>
   He sees a score close to par winning at The Olympic Club. He
sees a guy hanging tough in the tortuous conditions pulling out a
hard-earned victory. He sees himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do,'' he said. ``I've played well here before. At Riviera
(in Los Angeles), I've always played well. They remind me of
home.''

   TOKYO _ As the yen continues to fall, experts worldwide say it
is due to severe loss of confidence in the Japanese economy. In
Japan, the experts say it is Nippon uri, or the selling out of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason, surely, is the extraordinary situation
surrounding interest rates in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   With the official discount rate stuck at 0.5 percent, and many
depositors in Japan getting less than 1 percent interest for their
money, it was inevitable that they would eventually begin to look
abroad. When they did, it was inevitable that the yen would begin
to weaken.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who keeps his money in yen is losing not just the
interest spread but also the exchange gains, a total of well over
10 percent per annum for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is not the yen collapse we see today but the
absence of collapse years ago when it was already clear that the
economy would not recover quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Timidity, misguided patriotism and optimism for early recovery
were the main reasons why most Japanese kept their money in Japan.
It has taken the best part of five years, and some easing of the
rules on sending money abroad, for depositors to get smart.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than loss of confidence or the selling out of Japan, what
we see now is a belated understanding of how foreign exchange
markets work.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly with the economy generally. It has long been obvious
that no economy, not even Japan's, could stand a sudden collapse of
the grossly inflated asset values built up during Japan's bubble
economy of the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, once the collapse got under way there was every chance
that it would spiral. Even interest rates at close to zero would
not stop the rot.
</P>
<P>
   The one person to realize this was the then-prime minister and
Keynesian economist Kiichi Miyazawa, back in 1992. But, as he said
on a recent television program, his proposal then for the
government to step in decisively to rescue bank loans already
turning sour because of collapsing asset values was derided on
every side, and by the business community especially.
</P>
<P>
   Right through until very recently, the business and other
``experts'' _ many heavily influenced by imported
Reaganite/Thatcherite policies _ told us variously that all would
be well if Japan simply bankrupted inefficient financial
institutions, embraced full deregulation, privatized the post
office system, moved to small government, reformed its
administration, increased the ratio of indirect to direct taxes,
and so on.
</P>
<P>
   It was similar to the way many in the West used the 1980s
recessions to push their own private agendas.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, we had the unbelievably foolish attempt late last
year to introduce an item that had long been high on the Finance
Ministry agenda, namely, a long-term program of severe fiscal
restraint _ at precisely the moment when the economy needed fiscal
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. experts were urging their favorite agenda item,
massive tax cuts _ in a nation where high savings propensity and
current pessimism guarantee that such cuts will simply end up as
extra savings, which is the last thing needed by Japan's
demand-starved economy.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the politicians have at last begun to stop
listening to these experts. Firm action to expand government
spending and rescue the banking system is at last being promised.
</P>
<P>
   These moves may be in time to rescue the economy. But things
would have been much better, for Japan and the rest of Asia, if
they had come in 1992. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ Just like the advent of the first millennium, the
approach of the year 2000 is bringing dire predictions of disaster.
Doomsayers are warning of aircraft falling from the sky, riots,
famine, martial law and stock market crashes.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the warnings are based not on superstition
but on hardheaded analyses of the potentially devastating effects
of the so-called millennium bug _ the inability of computers to
recognize the year 2000 because past programmers used only two
digits to denote years, without identifying the century.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, countless computer software systems and millions of
chips embedded in ``intelligent'' products around the world are
likely to shut down or go haywire on Jan. 1, 2000, jeopardizing
basic services from electricity and water supplies to transport,
health care and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   A few scattered optimists still argue that the problem has been
grossly exaggerated, and it is true that some of the worst-case
scenarios are overly hysterical. But most experts insist that it is
now too late to avoid serious disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred professionals surveyed by the Washington D.C.
Year 2000 Group rated the impact of the problem on the United
States at an average of just under five on a scale of zero to 10 _
with 10 representing the collapse of the U.S. government and
possible famine.
</P>
<P>
   A rating of five signified mild recession, isolated food, fuel
and power shortages, disruption of transport services such as
trucking and air travel and runs on banks. Some people, however,
fear it will be much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell,
told a recent conference organized by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington that there was a 60 percent
chance of a severe global recession and that Wall Street could fall
by 30 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   Much will depend on how far governments and private businesses
succeed in defusing the time bomb over the next 18 months. Nobody,
however, believes that all the errors will be corrected _ not even
in the United States, which leads the world in tackling the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Most other countries are far behind. Instead of giving priority
to the millennium bug, Asia is largely focusing on resolving its
financial crisis and Europe on introducing its single currency, the
euro. Many developing countries are hardly aware of the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Even companies and government departments that think they have
made the necessary technical adjustments will be vulnerable to
disruptions if their suppliers and other contacts have failed to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Contagion could spread from uncleansed systems back to those
that have been corrected.
</P>
<P>
   One does not have to believe the most extreme scenarios to take
the sensible precautions most experts now recommend. Businesses,
for instance, should assign top managers, not just technical
experts, to the problem, draw up contingency plans for coping with
systems failures and postpone complicated operations like
accounting changes.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the same applies to governments, which have the added
responsibility for heading off military disasters, such as might be
caused, for example, by false warnings of nuclear missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, political leaders urgently need to explain the risks
and activate coordinated responses. In the United States, there is
widespread amazement at the silence of Vice President Al Gore, the
administration's top computer geek, whose bid for the presidency in
the 2000 elections could be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to take to the hills, as some survivalists are
urging. But the Central Intelligence Agency is advising its
employees to pay their bills early in December 1999, keep cash on
hand and lay in extra blankets.
</P>
<P>
   And many people, whether they are superstitious or not, probably
won't want to be in a plane as the millennium dawns. &QL;

   PARIS _ In the 1996 U.S. presidential election, ``soccer moms''
were a prime target of vote canvassing by the candidates. What's
happened to them?
</P>
<P>
   The phrase referred to middle-class housewives, characterized as
soccer moms, who often drove their kids to soccer games or
practices.
</P>
<P>
   It was coined against the background of the growing popularity
of soccer in the United States in this particular demographic
segment two years after the country played host to the World Cup in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, as the U.S. team competes in the World Cup in
France, soccer commentators and the media are once again discussing
the same old subject: Is soccer taking hold in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes and no, it seems. According to Brian Remedi,
an official at the U.S. Soccer Federation, the answer is yes.
``Soccer moms still very much exist and will increase in the future
as the sport will become even more popular in the country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say, however, that soccer as a spectator sport
has yet to take root in American society, although it has taken
hold in schools and colleges, and Hispanic immigrants
enthusiastically follow the game.
</P>
<P>
   A resident in Chicago contacted by telephone said on June 14:
``The whole city was literally watching the Chicago Bulls (win the
NBA title), and I am not kidding because I was downtown last night,
and when it was over, everyone was out in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say that soccer does not appeal to the psyche of Americans
as much as basketball because of few goals and no breaks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Soccer Industry Council of America, a committee
of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, 18 million
Americans played soccer at least once in 1997, unchanged from the
1995 figure. In 1993, the number was 16.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly soccer is not the most popular sport in the country.
Basketball, baseball and American football are known to generate
more spectators,'' said Remedi.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted: ''It will be a long road to catch these sports.
But keep your eyes out because soccer in the United States will be
coming up over the next few years, particularly with our new league
which is in its third season now.''
</P>
<P>
   While soccer has not reached the status of basketball and
baseball, the American Soccer Federation is embarking on a new
project that looks ahead to 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no little plan,'' said federation president Alan
Rothenberg. ``This is a vision on a grand scale.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the project, about $50 million will be spent for
soccer development during the next 12 years. The federation will
expand on its current program called Project 40, in which teenagers
leave college soccer to join professional teams in exchange for
room, board and scholarship.
</P>

   The federation intends to have up to 120 youth players in its
professional development program by 2009, according to Remedi.

<P>
   How far the project will succeed remains to be seen, and the
future of soccer as a spectator sport is anyone's guess.

doubts that soccer will ever become a major sport in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good idea why the United States has the sporting
activities that it does, because of its determination to be
independent of the British, certainly not to adopt games that were
of British origin like soccer and cricket,'' he said.

<P>
   ``It is a sign of the way the United States sees itself in the
world, a sign of the traditional insularity of the country,'' he

   Duncan Sisson, 18, from New York, who watched the U.S. national
team beaten by Germany 2-0 on June 15 at the Paris stadium, said he
prefers soccer to other games like baseball and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a traditional sport and I like the tradition part. But
the way I feel about soccer is still a minority view,'' Sisson
said. &QL;

   PARIS _ In the 1996 U.S. presidential election, ``soccer moms''
were a prime target of vote canvassing by the candidates. What's
happened to them?
</P>
<P>
   The phrase referred to middle-class housewives, characterized as
soccer moms, who often drove their kids to soccer games or
practices.
</P>
<P>
   It was coined against the background of the growing popularity
of soccer in the United States in this particular demographic
segment two years after the country played host to the World Cup in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, as the U.S. team competes in the World Cup in
France, soccer commentators and the media are once again discussing
the same old subject: Is soccer taking hold in the United States?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes and no, it seems. According to Brian Remedi,
an official at the U.S. Soccer Federation, the answer is yes.
``Soccer moms still very much exist and will increase in the future
as the sport will become even more popular in the country,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say, however, that soccer as a spectator sport
has yet to take root in American society, although it has taken
hold in schools and colleges, and Hispanic immigrants
enthusiastically follow the game.
</P>
<P>
   A resident in Chicago contacted by telephone said on June 14:
``The whole city was literally watching the Chicago Bulls (win the
NBA title), and I am not kidding because I was downtown last night,
and when it was over, everyone was out in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say that soccer does not appeal to the psyche of Americans
as much as basketball because of few goals and no breaks.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Soccer Industry Council of America, a committee
of the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association, 18 million
Americans played soccer at least once in 1997, unchanged from the
1995 figure. In 1993, the number was 16.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly soccer is not the most popular sport in the country.
Basketball, baseball and American football are known to generate
more spectators,'' said Remedi.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted: ''It will be a long road to catch these sports.
But keep your eyes out because soccer in the United States will be
coming up over the next few years, particularly with our new league
which is in its third season now.''
</P>
<P>
   While soccer has not reached the status of basketball and
baseball, the American Soccer Federation is embarking on a new
project that looks ahead to 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no little plan,'' said federation president Alan
Rothenberg. ``This is a vision on a grand scale.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the project, about $50 million will be spent for
soccer development during the next 12 years. The federation will
expand on its current program called Project 40, in which teenagers
leave college soccer to join professional teams in exchange for
room, board and scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The federation intends to have up to 120 youth players in its
professional development program by 2009, according to Remedi.
</P>
<P>
   How far the project will succeed remains to be seen, and the
future of soccer as a spectator sport is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   But John Williams, a sociologist at the University of Leicester,
doubts that soccer will ever become a major sport in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good idea why the United States has the sporting
activities that it does, because of its determination to be
independent of the British, certainly not to adopt games that were
of British origin like soccer and cricket,'' he said.
</P>

said.

VALLEY DIVISION WINS CAL LEAGUE ALL-STAR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS COCOLES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANCASTER _ The much-maligned Freeway Division was giving the
Lancaster Municipal Stadium crowd of 4,714 what few expected
Tuesday night: a competitive California League All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   The quintet that saw its first-half champion finish just two
games over .500 refused to bow down to a Valley Division that
claimed four of five teams completing the halfway mark with at
least a .500 record, including first-place San Jose's 46-24 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The Freeway took a major detour in the fifth inning, however,
and the favored Valley Division took command, scoring five times to
win the game 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   With his team leading 3-2, Freeway Division pitcher Brent Iddon
of the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes was the victim of both timely Valley
hitting and shoddy defense by his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage began with singles by Michael Byas and Jeff DaVanon.
With Byas at third, right fielder Luke Allen misjudged Josh
Klimek's fly ball for a three-base error and the go-ahead runs.
Iddon recorded one out but yielded a smash off the
right-center-field fence by Modesto's Cody McKay for a triple. When
Allen bobbled the ball for his second error of the inning, the A's
catcher chugged around third and scored to make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw (Valley Division manager Rick Burleson) waving me
in, I thought he was joking,'' said McKay, who spent two weeks at
Double-A Huntsville, flew into LAX at 4 a.m. Tuesday and leaves
today for a stint at Triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (McKay) was about halfway home, he had tired a little
bit. I could see it,'' Burleson said. ``Had it been a clean relay
throw, it would have been a bang-bang play at the plate. It was a
gamble and it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The circus atmosphere didn't stop there after Rod Barajas
doubled and moved to third on a groundout. With Visalia's Mike
Holmes in for Iddon, JetHawk Adonis Harrison's grounder to the
right side was booted by second baseman Dionys Cesar of Visalia.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose's Juan Dilone, a 25-year-old veteran of seven
minor-league seasons, was the unanimous choice as the game's most
valuable player after going for 3 for 4 with a home run and three
RBI.
</P>
<P>
   JetHawks right-hander Brian Sweeney struck out the side
sandwiched between a walk in his one inning to earn the pitching
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous when I came in to the game,'' Sweeney said.
``I was a little wild with the walk, but there was a lot of
adrenaline in me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Freeway Division started quickly when San Bernardino's Rich
Saitta hit the 1-2 pitch of San Jose's Jason Grote over the
right-center-field fence for a home run leading off the game.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the Valley Division tied the score but fell behind a run,
the last time in the top of the fifth when JetHawks ace Patrick
Dunham allowed the go-ahead run on Luke Allen's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   This All-Star game meant as much to Visalia's Duane Filchner
than perhaps to any of the remaining 43 players. The 25-year-old,
in his fourth season with the Oakland A's organization, retired
following the game in favor of a position in the athletic
department at Radford University.
</P>
<P>
   Filchner participated in the pregame home run contest and
thrilled the crowd by going deep 12 times in the opening round.
Filchner, who singled in three at-bats as the starting designated
hitter, reached the finals against Modesto's McKay. After each hit
one home run, McKay defeated his Oakland teammate with a homer over
the fence in right in a one-pitch tiebreaker. Combining the three
rounds, Filchner actually outhomered McKay 19-18.

DODGERS FALL 10{ BACK WITH LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ It's only June, they keep saying, not even summer,
yet.
</P>
<P>
   What the Dodgers aren't saying is that they are coming very
close to a summer without hope.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's 10-6 loss to the San Diego Padres at Qual Comm Stadium
dropped them 10{ games back in the National League West, the
largest deficit they have faced in almost five years.
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of numbers are numbing for a team that was
overhauled a month ago in hopes of bringing it back to life. So far
it hasn't happened. What is next? Firing Bill Russell? Benching
Bobby Bonilla?
</P>
<P>
   Drastic measures, but the Dodgers' new management has shown it
will drop bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we are concerned,'' said catcher Charles Johnson,
one of the four players who came over May 15 in the Mike Piazza
trade. ``We want to get a little momentum going before the All-Star
break and see where it leads us. But that just isn't happening.''
</P>
<P>
   They knew coming to San Diego they were facing the hottest team
in baseball. The Padres (45-25) now have eight consecutive
victories and reclaimed the National League West lead by sweeping
San Francisco over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who appeared to have passed the .500 mark for good
Friday, have dropped three in a row and are 34-35.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we were only eight back,'' said Bonilla, who has
just one hit in his last 23 at-bats. ``Just a couple of days
ago....''
</P>
<P>
   It is bad enough that Ramon Martinez could be facing
season-ending surgery after reinjuring his right shoulder on
Sunday. It didn't help that Chan Ho Park failed to step into
Martinez's role as the staff ace.
</P>
<P>
   Park was coming off his first victory since May 13 when he
allowed just one run in eight innings against Oakland last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He threw hard Tuesday, but when he needed to make big pitches he
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Park (5-4) gave up a two-run double to Tony Gwynn in the third
inning that tied the game 2-2. It was Gwynn's first start in a week
since straining his left calf.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 3-3 in the sixth, Park allowed a two-run
homer to Ken Caminiti. Although the Dodgers scored three runs in
the ninth, they never recovered from Caminiti's home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest problem I had tonight,'' pitching coach
Goose Gregson said. ``He threw as well as I've seen this year, but
there are always players you make sure don't beat you. Those were
the guys who beat us tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers even spotted him a 2-0 lead on home runs by Gary
Sheffield and Raul Mondesi on a rare night when Padres right-hander
Kevin Brown (7-3) did not have his best stuff.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres appeared to blow open the game in the seventh when
former Dodger Carlos Hernandez lined a three-run double into the
left-field corner against Mark Guthrie, who replaced Park after six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie allowed a fourth run and all of them were unearned. With
one out, Greg Vaughn grounded to short, but Eric Young did not
touch the bag as he tried to complete a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Second-base umpire Jim Quick ruled the base runner, Caminiti,
was safe. When Hernandez doubled it just seemed like piling on. It
turned out to be a critical play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the way this stretch is going,'' said Young, who
stole his major league-leading 27th base.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Dodgers held a players-only meeting with
hopes of regaining some of the fire lost in back-to-back losses to
Colorado on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers rallied for three runs in the ninth inning against
right-hander Brian Boehringer. Jose Vizcaino singled home two runs
and Sheffield followed with an RBI double. But Trevor Hoffman came
on to get the final out for his 21st save in 21 opportunities, the
only closer in the majors who is perfect this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield continue his hot hitting since joining the club in the
big trade with the Florida Marlins. With three more hits he is
batting .352 (35 for 96) since joining the club.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonilla continues to struggle since his first weekend with
the club. Tuesday, Bonilla went 0 for 4, including an inning-ending
double play in the eighth after the first two batters reached base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is way beyond a slump,'' Bonilla said. ``This is
brutal.''

WESTPHAL TO BE NEXT SONICS COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Barely three weeks after George Karl's Seattle era
ended, the Sonics are set to begin their Paul Westphal chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic president Wally Walker has settled on Westphal to become
the team's next head coach, the Post-Intelligencer has learned. A
source within the organization and another close to the situation
said Walker would name Westphal to replace Karl before the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Both sources said the announcement could come as soon as
Wednesday afternoon. A news conference will certainly take place by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal beat out finalists Bob Hill, Charlotte assistant Paul
Silas and former Sonic assistant Bob Weiss. The Sonics waited until
after the NBA Finals so they could speak with Chicago's Phil
Jackson. Walker, though, lost interest in Jackson on Monday after
learning the Bulls coach wanted more time to decide his future.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal has been Walker's choice all along, and Westphal's
meeting with All-Star point guard Gary Payton on Monday cinched the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch in Oakland, Calif., Payton's hometown, they discussed
coaching philosophy and Westphal's ideas about how to run the team.
Payton left satisfied, and that is all Walker needed to hear.
Walker recommended Westphal to team owner Barry Ackerley, who was
impressed by the new coach in a meeting several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Walker needs only to finalize details. He and Westphal are
close to agreement on a two- or three-year deal worth between $1
million and $1.5 million each season.
</P>
<P>
   Walker refused comment Tuesday. Westphal has not spoken publicly
about his candidacy since the Sonics decided not to re-hire Karl.
</P>
<P>
   When Westphal is introduced, his task instantly becomes a
daunting one. Westphal, 47, has to at least match Karl's success.
Karl was essentially fired _ in technical terms, they allowed his
contract to expire and did not offer a new one _ despite the
coach's outstanding regular-season record: .719 winning percentage
and an average of 55 victories the past six seasons. But Walker
said the decision to release Karl was because he could no longer
trust the coach on sensitive matters.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Walker and Westphal have remained friends since both
played for the Sonics during the 1980-81 season. Walker also is
sold on Westphal's past success with the Phoenix Suns and his
reputation as a player's coach. It helps that Westphal is known to
be very discreet and conservative _ just like Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is entering the final season of his five-year deal as
president of the Sonics. It makes sense that, given the chance,
Walker would want to have a coach that is a more comfortable fit
with himself.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in Phoenix said that Westphal has not coached since 1996
for one simple reason: He has been waiting for the opportunity to
coach a good team. With Payton and Vin Baker already on hand and
the ability to add a big player in the free-agent market, the
Sonics are poised to again be a contender for the Western
Conference crown.
</P>
<P>
   After spending four years as an assistant coach in Phoenix,
Westphal took over the Suns and led them to the 1993 NBA Finals.
Phoenix lost the title to the Bulls, but won 62 games that year.
Westphal won 56 and 59 games the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   An injury-plagued season amid high expectations did in Westpahl.
Phoenix was 14-19 when the Suns fired him. Westphal, though, is
getting a second chance because of his association with Walker and
his established record. He also is a good communicator who can
balance relationships with management and players.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, Charles Barkley won his only Most Valuable Player award
under Westphal. Several Phoenix players, including Dan Majerle,
became All-Stars during Westphal's reign. Westphal also coached
marginal centers (Oliver Miller, Jerrod Mustaf, Mark West and Joe
Kleine) during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Those credentials bode well in Walker's eyes because Payton
finished third behind Michael Jordan and Karl Malone in the MVP
voting. In addition, Sonic starting center Jim McIlvaine is still
considered a major project.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's system will cater to Payton with uptempo offensive
sets. Westphal will occasionally trap and double-team on defense _
unlike Karl, whose constant double teams hurt the Sonics in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, without a shot at Jackson, Walker saw Westphal as
the best choice. Hill blew his chances by publicly campaigning for
the job. Silas and Weiss, both former Sonic players, were
considered risks because of unsuccessful stints as head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics felt they had to replace a proven winner with a
proven winner, which is why they will name Westphal as their next
head coach.

TIGER BRINGS THE HEAT TO EVERY EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM KEOWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The surprise isn't that Tiger Woods was walking around the
Olympic Club during a U.S. Open practice round Tuesday with four
uniformed police officers. The surprise was that he couldn't walk
around without them.
</P>
<P>
   People need to get close, to feel the flames. They need an
autograph or a glance or a brush of a sleeve. They need him to make
them a memory or maybe some cash.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is beyond golf, into another realm. Movie stars stay
hidden behind locked gates or tinted glass, emerging only in
virtual form. Woods is out there, among the people. With most
golfers, being among the people is a treat. For Woods, it's an
occupational hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone says Woods' charisma and race have transformed golf
into something more accessible to the people, but that's just the
start of it. Perhaps his most impressive act has been turning golf
into a contact sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get aggressive and tend to crowd in,'' Woods said,
describing his adoring throng. ``It gets pretty violent out there.
There are adults knocking over kids to get an autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco police officer Rich McNaughton drew Tiger duty
Tuesday, and you would think the assignment would be a chance for
an officer to take a break from mediating man's more heinous
endeavors. Instead, he got to see a moving cluster of human
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we weren't there, he wouldn't have been able to go from tee
to green from the 16th through the 18th,'' McNaughton said.
</P>
<P>
   (McNaughton did, however, have time to make an honest assessment
of Tiger's game _ ``I didn't think he played very well today,'' he
said in a concerned tone.)
</P>
<P>
   For Woods, there is the occasional death threat, which he shrugs
off as would any world-famous 22-year-old. There are kids working
for collectors and collectors working for themselves. In the middle
of it, there are also kids just trying to catch a glimpse of him,
just to say they did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to distinguish between the two,'' Woods says.
</P>
<P>
   It's also hard to imagine what could compel grown men to fire
their bodies into a crowd, through children, in search of a name
written on a piece of paper, but it takes all kinds.
</P>
<P>
   The police are with him all the way, every week. Without them,
he would be swallowed up, submerged inside a great clump of
humanity and carried away to a secret location filled with nothing
but felt pens and 8x10 glossies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody else can go from A to Z _ not him,'' McNaughton
said. ``Paul Azinger walked past us and nobody even noticed him. He
had to work his way through. You need some uniforms out there, just
so they take you seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods played with fellow Stanfordites Casey Martin and Joel
Kribel on Tuesday, and there is considerable sentiment that
Martin's situation has relegated Woods to secondary status this
week. In answer to that supposition, Woods says, ``That feels
great.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Woods is the main story. He always is. Every
tournament, every round, every hole, nobody in golf is watched more
closely. To the people who tune in only for the majors, Woods is
the show. Every golfer and every spectator is aware of his
presence, even if he does come to the Olympic Club as a prohibitive
underdog.
</P>
<P>
   The official dossier on Woods indicates a style that is not
suitable to winning a U.S. Open. His swashbuckling play is
apparently at odds with the calculated shot-making needed to excel
on a mind-numbing course such as Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the numbers bear out the theory. In his three U.S.
Opens, he is a combined 24-over par. To which he says, laughing a
self-assured laugh, ``I was 21 when you all started speculating on
this. I'm only 22 now.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jack Nicklaus suggested Tuesday, maybe Woods doesn't yet
deserve to be showered with expectations. Maybe it's not his turn.
Still, it sounds strange to hear that Woods' ability to hit the
ball a long way is actually a disadvantage. Woods doesn't
understand this, either; he seems to find it logical to assume that
if a man can hit the ball a long, long way off the tee, he probably
can throttle it down _ through club choice and etc. _ and manage to
hit it a little shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, although the course is the shortest U.S. Open course,
we're not talking about windmills and alligators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those golf courses where you don't always use
your length, but it's an advantage,'' he said. ``I think it's a
great advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else might be right. The circumstances might favor the
patient plodding of Mark O'Meara or Tom Lehman, but who would you
rather watch? Woods might finish 11th, but he'll be easy to find.
Just look for the group of grown men using 6-year-olds as ladders.

WHITE HOUSE BLASTS LOTT FOR VIEWS ON GAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ In an escalating war of rhetoric, the White House
pounced Tuesday on Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott's
controversial comments on homosexuality, calling them ``backward in
thinking'' and ``an indicator of how difficult it is to do rational
work in Washington.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using unusually blunt language, White House spokesman Mike
McCurry said Lott's comparison of gays to kleptomaniacs, sex
addicts and alcoholics reveals a prejudice that is, ``to put it
charitably, quite out of date.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority leader has taken an incorrect view that
homosexuality is a disease,'' McCurry said. ``It is not.''
</P>
<P>
   McCurry used the occasion to voice the administration's
strongest protest to date over the stalled nomination of San
Francisco philanthropist James Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg.
The nomination to the relatively inconsequential post is emerging
as a high-profile battleground over gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would they oppose someone who is otherwise well-qualified
to be a U.S. ambassador, other than the prejudice that exists in
their minds against people who are gay and lesbian?'' McCurry
asked. ``They're refusing to move forward on that nomination
because he's gay. That's quite plain and simply the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments came a day after Lott told an interviewer that he
believes engaging in gay sex is a sin and a problem to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should still love that person. You should not try to
mistreat them as outcasts,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others have a sex addiction or are kleptomaniacs,'' Lott
continued. ``There are all kinds of problems and addictions, and
difficulties and experiences of this kind that are wrong. But you
should try to work with that person to learn to control that
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments were made as part of a taped interview conducted by
conservative talk-show host Armstrong Williams for the America's
Voice network. The Hormel nomination was not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Williams defended Lott Tuesday, saying the senator was speaking
personally as a devout Southern Baptist, not as the majority
leader. Appearing on CNN's ``Inside Politics,'' he vehemently
disputed reports that Lott considers homosexuality immoral, making
a distinction between being gay and having gay sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many (gays) have decided to be celibate,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott declined to personally respond to McCurry's statement or to
discuss whether he is holding up Hormel's nomination because of his
religious convictions.
</P>
<P>
   However, his spokeswoman, Susan Irby, criticized McCurry, saying
his ``experience within this White House does not qualify him to
tell the American people what is right and what is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he considers to be backward are the views and values of
the great majority of Americans, who understand and are concerned
about the grave social and ethical questions our country faces,''
Irby said in a statement faxed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, asked about Lott's
comments, avoided the word ``sin'' but said: ``The Bible is very
clear on this. ... Both myself and Sen. Lott believe very strongly
in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics said Lott's comments reflect the growing influence
within the Congress and the Republican Party of socially
conservative groups such as Gary Bauer's Family Research Council
and James Dobson's Focus on the Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership has gone through contortions to
appease James Dobson, and this extremist rhetoric will backfire
because the majority of Americans oppose discrimination,'' said
David Smith, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign,
a Washington-based gay lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Birch, executive director of the Human Rights
Campaign, wrote to Lott Tuesday and offered to personally explain
``the many challenges facing gay people in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, Birch noted that the American Psychiatric
Association removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders
in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans, a gay Republican group, said Lott has
insulted the gay members of his party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is ignorance on his part or blatant pandering to
James Dobson and the radical right, it's wrong and it will cost the
party,'' said Log Cabin Executive Director Richard Tafel.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lott did not discuss Hormel in the interview, those
working to secure his confirmation viewed the comments as a bad
sign. Hormel, heir to a meat-packing fortune and a regular
Democratic Party contributor, was nominated by Clinton last year to
serve as ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination was approved by the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. But a small group of Republicans complained about
Hormel's support for gay causes and have prevented the matter from
reaching the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she has ``at least 60''
and perhaps as many as 62 votes in support of Hormel, more than
enough to confirm his nomination. But she first must convince Lott
to schedule a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she was ``shocked'' by Lott's comments and flatly
disagrees with his conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said she hopes that Lott's attitude toward
homosexuality will not affect his decision on Hormel.
</P>
<P>
   If Hormel cannot be confirmed because of his sexuality,
Feinstein said, ``Then the message (Republicans) are sending out is
that no one who is gay need participate in their government.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said that now more than ever an
``honest discussion'' regarding Hormel should be conducted on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, I worry about a climate that will become
increasingly polarized, increasingly poisoned, and we don't want
that to happen,'' he said in a speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone has pledged to use parliamentary maneuvers to try to
force a vote on Hormel as soon as the Senate completes work on the
tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The strongest comments came from the usually restrained McCurry,
who said that Clinton ``thinks the American people understand how
difficult it is to get business done in Washington sometimes when
you're dealing with people who are so backward in their thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For over 25 years, it's been quite clear that sexual
orientation is not an affliction, it is not a disease, it is
something that is a part of defining one's sexuality,'' he said.
``And the fact that the majority leader has such views, apparently
consistent with some who are fairly extreme in his party, is an
indicator of how difficult it is to do rational work in
Washington.''  &LR;

SENATE CAPS TOBACCO LEGAL FEES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    WASHINGTON _ By a one-vote margin, the Senate imposed Tuesday a
$4,000-an-hour limit on legal fees for trial lawyers as part of the
the half-trillion dollar tobacco legislation, removing a big
obstacle to passage of the bill.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 49-to-48 vote was a crushing blow to trial attorneys. By
some estimates, a handful of law firms involved in tobacco
litigation had stood to win a staggering $100 billion in legal fees
over 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The attorneys were expecting to collect contingency fees ranging
from 3 to 30 percent of the settlement. They argued that they are
entitled to such a mammoth payout because they were willing to take
on the tobacco industry years ago when no one else would, and would
have received nothing had they lost.
</P>
<P>
   New York University law professor Lester Brickman calculated
that without the fee cap, the tobacco legislation would have made
billionaires out of 10 lawyers and hundred-millionaires out of 50
more.
</P>
<P>
   The fee cap will ``cost the trial lawyers billions and billions
of dollars,'' Brickman said. ``They'll have to be content with a
few measly $100 millions instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts to limit legal fees, first to $250 an hour, and
then to $1,000 an hour, were roundly defeated. The highest-paid
lawyers in Washington charge roughly $500 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to make millionaires out of lawyers simply
because they were lucky enough or even wise enough to get into this
field at an opportune time,'' said Senator Slade Gorton, the
Washington Republican who sponsored the limit. ``We particularly
don't need to do it for those lawyers who didn't bother to get into
it until this litigation was a slam dunk.''
</P>
<P>
   The roll-call vote was prolonged by last-minute arm-twisting,
and the fee cap passed only when Gordon Smith, R-Ore., changed his
vote to yes.
</P>
<P>
   The $516 billion tobacco bill, sponsored by Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., would raise cigarette taxes by $1.10 a pack, regulate
tobacco marketing and set up a host of new programs covering
everything from illegal drugs to child care.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also settle 40 state claims against the tobacco
companies to recoup Medicaid costs for smoking-related illnesses.
State attorneys general had hired private attorneys to help them
with the litigation. The attorneys agreed to &UR;  &LR; work on a
contingency-fee basis, as is common in large cases, but that was
before anyone knew the settlement would reach into the financial
stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Some law firms were involved in several of the state suits,
standing to collect fees in each one. Six of the 12 law firms
involved in Florida's $11 billion settlement have been disputing a
deal that would provide $280 million in legal fees. The six firms
instead want $2.5 billion, or the 25 percent contingency fee
originally agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, state Attorney General Dan Morales and a federal judge
approved a $2.3 billion contingency fee to a handful of Texas
firms.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Gorton said the $4,000 limit should apply to
the Florida and Texas cases.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers are among the top donors to the Democratic Party
and one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington. They give less
money to Republicans because of the GOP's support for limits on
product liability, but nonetheless count many Republicans among
their key supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the attorney fee limits were a subterfuge
intended to kill the tobacco bill, which aims to reduce teen
smoking by increasing the price of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., argued that limits on attorney fees
are ``arbitrary and capricious'' and ``a profound mistake'' because
the Senate ``shouldn't be involved in deciding what legal fees are.
That's micromanagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dick Durban, D-Ill., himself a former trial lawyer, added,
``This bill is not about the lawyers, it's about our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   After approving the cap on legal fees, the Senate then turned
its attention to compensation for tobacco farmers _ another
powerful Washington lobby and the last big hurdle blocking the
bill. Lawmakers are grappling with the question of how much to
compensate farmers for losing what is already a government-created
windfall _ the valuable tobacco ``quotas'' that restrict tobacco
planting to keep prices and farmer incomes high.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco program dates back to 1933, when Congress gave
``temporary'' aid to farmers of a few Depression-era crops. Because
the quotas keep tobacco prices artificially high, they are
valuable. They can be bought and sold and even inherited; many are
owned by nonfarmers, who lease them.
</P>
<P>
   The original tobacco bill would pay tobacco farmers $28 billion
over 25 years if they relinquish their right to grow tobacco. It
would leave the quota system intact.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Republican Richard Lugar, who has led the drive to end
farm subsidies, pushed an alternative that would pay the farmers
$18 billion over three years and eliminate the quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Under both proposals, most of the money would go to roughly
124,000 farmers; if they receive $28 billion, that averages some
$200,000 per farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are split on the two alternatives; some support the
Lugar provision because it would allow them to continue growing
tobacco. Prices would fall, but so would costs. Others want the
option of keeping the quotas to maintain high prices if they decide
not to relinquish their quotas.
</P>
<P>
   All want to be paid. ``What growers want is compensation for the
value of the quota,'' said Graham Boyd, executive vice president of
the North Carolina Tobacco Growers Association. ``If you don't
compensate these people they are all going to go out of business
overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd defended payments to nonfarmers who own quotas, arguing
that many are widows who lease their quotas to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the tobacco bill remains murky after a month of
contentious debate. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott called for a
closed-door meeting of rank and file Republicans Wednesday to
determine strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Key Republicans continue to oppose the legislation because it
constitutes a huge tax increase and creates many new federal
programs. But GOP ranks broke when amendments were approved to cut
taxes for married couples and increase health insurance tax
deductions for the self-employed. If the bill clears the Senate, it
faces stiff opposition in the House, which also could make
substantial changes.

   In the future, you might be consuming foods that include
high-yield, insect-resistant breeds of corn and herbicide-resistant
soybeans. They're called ``transgenic'' crops, and some people
claim they may hold the power to increase food production around
the world. Seed companies say the plants they've created are safe.
But who's to know what will come from a romp in the field with an

 c.1998 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemplating world hunger from the vantage point of a
well-laden breakfast table is certainly comfortable, if odd.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last January, executives of Iowa-based Pioneer
Hi-Bred International, the ``world's largest developer, producer
and marketer of genetically improved seed,'' gathered at a cafe in
downtown Manhattan for a discussion about global food security.
</P>
<P>
   The three officials and a group of journalists ate pancakes and
muffins as Pioneer's chairman and CEO, Chuck Johnson, outlined his
vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business we're in is ensuring that the world has the
capacity to have the food it needs to survive,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   That future capacity, he is convinced, can come only from the
crops that companies such as Pioneer are producing: high-yield,
insect-resistant breeds of corn, soybeans, sorghum and sunflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer makes some of its seeds conventionally, by creating
hybrids. Back in the 1920s, though, the conventional was radical,
and the typical farmer looked upon the newfangled seeds, in
Johnson's words, as ``witchcraft and Satanism _ until he got his
first taste of the yield.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, however, Pioneer has been offering
genetically engineered seeds, which have genes spliced into their
chromosomes that make them more resistant to insects and weed
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told the journalists about herbicide-resistant soybeans
and a variety of corn that produces a toxin normally made by a
bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, a million acres of the Bt corn were planted
in the Midwest, with an increased yield of 10 percent to 15
percent, thanks to the way the Bt toxin discourages corn-eating
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's vice president for marketing, Mary McBride, then
chimed in, claiming that these ``transgenic'' crops have the power
to increase food production in the developing world with minimal
environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer, as McBride put it, is creating ``virtual acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of transgenic crops claim that ecological and
evolutionary forces could turn these crops into disasters. Perhaps
the plants will prove so robust that they will grow aggressively,
like weeds, and invade other environments _ including a neighboring
farmer's fields.
</P>
<P>
   Virus-resistance genes could escape into weeds and make them so
hardy they'd outcompete endangered plants in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic-resistance genes (which botanists insert into
transgenic crops as supposedly harmless markers) might escape into
soil bacteria and from there into those that infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Crops engineered to carry Bt-toxin genes might trigger the
evolution of ever adaptive Bt-resistant bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Is all this worry just more witchcraft and Satanism? The only
way to know how seriously to take such doomsday scenarios is to run
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have only begun to do this work, setting up
experiments to see how readily transgenic genes and proteins can
escape the crops they were meant to help. The results thus far are
proving that the doomsday scenarios are not pure fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers are split over whether the results should be
cause for anxiety. Much of the concern over transgenic crops stems
from the promiscuous sexual habits of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can pollen from one breed of plant fertilize another,
but different species can sometimes mate and produce hybrids that
can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Genes in one population of plants (crops, for example) can thus
seep into another population (neighboring weeds).
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s geneticist Norman Ellstrand at the University
of California at Riverside began warning of the dangers of this
genetic escape.
</P>
<P>
   One could, for example, imagine an herbicide-resistance gene
getting into weeds and making superweeds that could take over a
field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this possibility hinged on how likely it was for crops and
weeds to hybridize, and for the transgenic genes to establish
themselves in the wild population.
</P>
<P>
   Ellstrand decided therefore to measure the likelihood, and in
1996 he reported that domesticated sorghum, Sorghum bicolor, could
readily form hybrids with a weed called Johnsongrass, Sorghum
halepense.
</P>
<P>
   (Domesticated crops are often surrounded by their close weedy
relatives, since both flourish under the same conditions.)
</P>
<P>
   Using harmless gene markers rather than actual transgenes,
Ellstrand found that wind-carried pollen could create hybrid seeds
over 300 feet away from the original crop.
</P>
<P>
   These hybrids produced pollen and seeds as viable as the
johnsongrass, meaning that they could spread just as aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   More recent experiments with actual transgenic crops also show
that inserted genes can move between species.
</P>
<P>
   Plant geneticist Rikke Bagger Jorgensen of Denmark's Riso
National Laboratory in Roskilde studied the yellow-flowered crop
called oilseed rape, known in the United States as canola and in
Latin as Brassica napus. Oilseed rape is a cultivated cross between
a weed called wild mustard, or Brassica campestris, and Brassica
oleracea, the cabbage plant.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen planted a version of oilseed rape engineered to
survive a weed killer called Basta alongside its wild ancestor (and
weedy neighbor) B. campestris.
</P>
<P>
   Fertile hybrids easily formed, and when jorgensen sowed the
hybrids together with the original weed, a second generation of
seeds was produced. These seeds grew to adulthood and turned out to
be impervious to Basta as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen returned to her fields the following spring and
discovered that this second generation had produced offspring of
their own, which continued to be herbicide resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these results, Jorgensen and others remain sanguine
about the prospects of transgenic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put in genes that give the plant itself a better
resistance, for instance, to fungal pathogens or to insect pests,
then you can minimize your use of pesticides, and that would be
beneficial to the environment,'' Jorgensen says. And she believes
that as long as transgenic oilseed rape is carefully managed, it
can be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spray very early, before the campestris flowers, you
minimize its potential to hybridize,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unwise to grow Basta-resistant oilseed rape
alongside a crop resistant to a different herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what you'll have is Brassica campestris plants with
multiresistance in very few generations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A weed with only one herbicide-resistance gene would, however,
still be manageable. As one researcher said, you can always destroy
the plants with another herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of herbicide-resistant crops creating the need for
spraying still more herbicides doesn't fit well with the
environmentally friendly image offered by companies like Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some critics think that biotech corporations are actually
comfortable with that prospect because they can make transgenic
crops as well as herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech companies, since they make the herbicides, don't
see it as a big problem, because it forces them to make a new
herbicide,'' says botanist Hugh Wilson of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>

   Wilson has been studying transgenic gene flow and its possible
effects not on the struggle between weeds and crops but between
weeds and rare or fragile wild plant species.

<P>
   Herbicide resistance isn't so much of a problem in this regard,
since weed killers are found only on farms. Of far more pressing
concern to him is the possibility that genes for resistance to
insects, viruses and fungi can be just as important in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that a spread of genes from transgenic crops
into wild plants could allow them to outcompete other species.

   One possible way to contain the threat of transgene escape might
be to bar certain genetically engineered crops when weedy relatives
already exist in a given place.

<P>
   ``There are no weeds related to maize in Europe,'' says French
cytogeneticist Anne-Marie Chevre of the national Institute of
Agronomic Research at Le Rheu. ``But we have a lot of wild species
more or less related to oilseed rape in the field everywhere.''
Therefore France has permitted transgenic corn to be grown on its
soil.
</P>
<P>
   The United States could similarly allow transgenic maize
soybeans, and potatoes to be farmed, since they have no wild
relatives with which they are sexually compatible here. On the
other hand, squashes and sunflowers do.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways that this policy might go wrong, however. A
desperate farmer might ignore the law and plant a transgenic crop
that can breed with local weeds.
</P>
<P>
   And crop-to-weed gene exchanges are only one kind of change that
transgenic crops can bring. Researchers have been developing a
transgenic potato, for example, that can fight off the aphids that
feed on it. The new potato produces a protein called lectin that
ruins the aphids' digestion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhouse tests have shown that this transgenic potato can
reduce populations of the peach-potato aphid by half. That's
impressive but not quite good enough to allow the potatoes to
survive on their own. To fully protect their crop, farmers would
need to introduce aphid-devouring ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   But as entomologist Nick Birch of the Scottish Crop Research
Institute in Dundee has shown, the lectin in the potato makes
ladybugs ill: After eating transgenic potato-glutted aphids,
ladybugs produce far fewer offspring and live much shorter lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though he has shown how transgenic crops can have
harmful effects that spread through a food chain, Birch doesn't
think his results are cause for alarm. If ladybugs can also find
aphids in the wild that are unaffected by transgenic potatoes, the
plant's harmful effects will be diluted.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Birch thinks that with careful tests of their
potential effects, transgenic crops can prove safe and useful in
reducing our dependence on pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows _ maybe those witchcraft and Satanism theories are
indeed wrong ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemplating world hunger from the vantage point of a
well-laden breakfast table is certainly comfortable, if odd.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last January, executives of Iowa-based Pioneer
Hi-Bred International, the ``world's largest developer, producer
and marketer of genetically improved seed,'' gathered at a cafe in
downtown Manhattan for a discussion about global food security.
</P>
<P>
   The three officials and a group of journalists ate pancakes and
muffins as Pioneer's chairman and CEO, Chuck Johnson, outlined his
vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business we're in is ensuring that the world has the
capacity to have the food it needs to survive,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   That future capacity, he is convinced, can come only from the
crops that companies such as Pioneer are producing: high-yield,
insect-resistant breeds of corn, soybeans, sorghum and sunflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer makes some of its seeds conventionally, by creating
hybrids. Back in the 1920s, though, the conventional was radical,
and the typical farmer looked upon the newfangled seeds, in
Johnson's words, as ``witchcraft and Satanism _ until he got his
first taste of the yield.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, however, Pioneer has been offering
genetically engineered seeds, which have genes spliced into their
chromosomes that make them more resistant to insects and weed
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told the journalists about herbicide-resistant soybeans
and a variety of corn that produces a toxin normally made by a
bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, a million acres of the Bt corn were planted
in the Midwest, with an increased yield of 10 percent to 15
percent, thanks to the way the Bt toxin discourages corn-eating
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's vice president for marketing, Mary McBride, then
chimed in, claiming that these ``transgenic'' crops have the power
to increase food production in the developing world with minimal
environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer, as McBride put it, is creating ``virtual acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of transgenic crops claim that ecological and
evolutionary forces could turn these crops into disasters. Perhaps
the plants will prove so robust that they will grow aggressively,
like weeds, and invade other environments _ including a neighboring
farmer's fields.
</P>
<P>
   Virus-resistance genes could escape into weeds and make them so
hardy they'd outcompete endangered plants in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic-resistance genes (which botanists insert into
transgenic crops as supposedly harmless markers) might escape into
soil bacteria and from there into those that infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Crops engineered to carry Bt-toxin genes might trigger the
evolution of ever adaptive Bt-resistant bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Is all this worry just more witchcraft and Satanism? The only
way to know how seriously to take such doomsday scenarios is to run
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have only begun to do this work, setting up
experiments to see how readily transgenic genes and proteins can
escape the crops they were meant to help. The results thus far are
proving that the doomsday scenarios are not pure fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers are split over whether the results should be
cause for anxiety. Much of the concern over transgenic crops stems
from the promiscuous sexual habits of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can pollen from one breed of plant fertilize another,
but different species can sometimes mate and produce hybrids that
can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Genes in one population of plants (crops, for example) can thus
seep into another population (neighboring weeds).
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s geneticist Norman Ellstrand at the University
of California at Riverside began warning of the dangers of this
genetic escape.
</P>
<P>
   One could, for example, imagine an herbicide-resistance gene
getting into weeds and making superweeds that could take over a
field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this possibility hinged on how likely it was for crops and
weeds to hybridize, and for the transgenic genes to establish
themselves in the wild population.
</P>
<P>
   Ellstrand decided therefore to measure the likelihood, and in
1996 he reported that domesticated sorghum, Sorghum bicolor, could
readily form hybrids with a weed called Johnsongrass, Sorghum
halepense.
</P>
<P>
   (Domesticated crops are often surrounded by their close weedy
relatives, since both flourish under the same conditions.)
</P>
<P>
   Using harmless gene markers rather than actual transgenes,
Ellstrand found that wind-carried pollen could create hybrid seeds
over 300 feet away from the original crop.
</P>
<P>
   These hybrids produced pollen and seeds as viable as the
johnsongrass, meaning that they could spread just as aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   More recent experiments with actual transgenic crops also show
that inserted genes can move between species.
</P>
<P>
   Plant geneticist Rikke Bagger Jorgensen of Denmark's Riso
National Laboratory in Roskilde studied the yellow-flowered crop
called oilseed rape, known in the United States as canola and in
Latin as Brassica napus. Oilseed rape is a cultivated cross between
a weed called wild mustard, or Brassica campestris, and Brassica
oleracea, the cabbage plant.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen planted a version of oilseed rape engineered to
survive a weed killer called Basta alongside its wild ancestor (and
weedy neighbor) B. campestris.
</P>
<P>
   Fertile hybrids easily formed, and when jorgensen sowed the
hybrids together with the original weed, a second generation of
seeds was produced. These seeds grew to adulthood and turned out to
be impervious to Basta as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen returned to her fields the following spring and
discovered that this second generation had produced offspring of
their own, which continued to be herbicide resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these results, Jorgensen and others remain sanguine
about the prospects of transgenic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put in genes that give the plant itself a better
resistance, for instance, to fungal pathogens or to insect pests,
then you can minimize your use of pesticides, and that would be
beneficial to the environment,'' Jorgensen says. And she believes
that as long as transgenic oilseed rape is carefully managed, it
can be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spray very early, before the campestris flowers, you
minimize its potential to hybridize,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unwise to grow Basta-resistant oilseed rape
alongside a crop resistant to a different herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what you'll have is Brassica campestris plants with
multiresistance in very few generations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A weed with only one herbicide-resistance gene would, however,
still be manageable. As one researcher said, you can always destroy
the plants with another herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of herbicide-resistant crops creating the need for
spraying still more herbicides doesn't fit well with the
environmentally friendly image offered by companies like Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some critics think that biotech corporations are actually
comfortable with that prospect because they can make transgenic
crops as well as herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech companies, since they make the herbicides, don't
see it as a big problem, because it forces them to make a new
herbicide,'' says botanist Hugh Wilson of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been studying transgenic gene flow and its possible
effects not on the struggle between weeds and crops but between
weeds and rare or fragile wild plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide resistance isn't so much of a problem in this regard,

   The night sky seldom offers a ``first'' _ an event never before
seen, even by the most grizzled observer.
</P>
<P>
   This past January featured one of those rare spectacles, when
the asteroid-observing spacecraft NEAR became the first
interplanetary craft visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the craft zipped in for a close approach (using Earth's
gravity to change its trajectory), the sun glinted off its large
solar panels, resulting in star-bright flashes in the northwestern
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fail to spot NEAR? Don't despair. While there won't be any more
interplanetary probes to view, this time of year offers a slew of
other manmade objects slowly crisscrossing the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't visible two months ago, and they won't be around
after August. But they're here now during satellite season, when
Earth's northern axis tilts just 5 degrees from its maximum sunward
extreme, allowing satellites as low as 200 miles to stand in full
sunlight even an hour after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four decades, some 7,000 satellites have been
launched into orbit around Earth. They deliver weather images,
monitor ground resources, provide telecommunications and
navigational aid.
</P>
<P>
   More often they're used by the military _ to spy on us even as
we try to spy them.
</P>
<P>
   Most satellites are invisible, but a few hundred are large
enough (typically school-bus size) and low enough (200 to 600 miles
up) to catch our eye.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest satellites orbit Earth in 90 minutes and take nine
minutes to cross the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites perched 600 miles up appear some 10 times dimmer,
take an extra 20 minutes to circle the globe and require up to 18
minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know you've spotted a satellite? Elementary, my dear
Westar. If it's a silent dot with no accompanying lights that moves
in a straight line, and if it crosses the sky in minutes rather
than seconds, you've spotted either an alien mother ship or a
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites sometimes appear to zigzag, but that's an optical
illusion resulting from imperceptible eye-muscle movements.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites travel every which way, but never east to west.
That's because they're usually launched in the same general
direction as the rotation of Earth, which gives them a free
1,000-miles-per-hour boost.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't circle the equator but are angled northward or
southward so they can fly over much of our planet in just a few
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Many TV viewers aim backyard dishes at communications satellites
stationed 22,300 miles up. Orbits at that distance are
geosynchronous _ the satellites orbit at the same speed as Earth
and so appear motionless. Don't even think of finding them; they
are a million times fainter than their lower cousins and hopelessly
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites can shine fairly steadily or wink on and off if
they're tumbling. And if they're tumbling _ and most do _ they're
no longer functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this space junk was always junk. Last October we passed
the 40th anniversary of the first shiny, useless, basketball-size
artificial satellite, Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sputnik was too small to be seen by the naked eye, and
the awestruck world gazed unwittingly at the huge discarded
third-stage booster that went with it into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Today over 22,000 pieces of unrecyclable debris clutter the
skies, garbage masquerading as fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   If you need help tracking the major satellites, the Web site
http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/spacecraft.html
provides current passages.
</P>
<P>
   Or simply go out as evening twilight ends and look around. After
only a minute or two you'll strike orbiting pay dirt.

seep into another population (neighboring weeds).
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s geneticist Norman Ellstrand at the University
of California at Riverside began warning of the dangers of this
genetic escape.
</P>
<P>
   One could, for example, imagine an herbicide-resistance gene
getting into weeds and making superweeds that could take over a
field.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this possibility hinged on how likely it was for crops and
weeds to hybridize, and for the transgenic genes to establish
themselves in the wild population.
</P>
<P>
   Ellstrand decided therefore to measure the likelihood, and in
1996 he reported that domesticated sorghum, Sorghum bicolor, could
readily form hybrids with a weed called Johnsongrass, Sorghum
halepense.
</P>
<P>
   (Domesticated crops are often surrounded by their close weedy
relatives, since both flourish under the same conditions.)
</P>
<P>
   Using harmless gene markers rather than actual transgenes,
Ellstrand found that wind-carried pollen could create hybrid seeds
over 300 feet away from the original crop.
</P>
<P>
   These hybrids produced pollen and seeds as viable as the
johnsongrass, meaning that they could spread just as aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   More recent experiments with actual transgenic crops also show
that inserted genes can move between species.
</P>
<P>
   Plant geneticist Rikke Bagger Jorgensen of Denmark's Riso
National Laboratory in Roskilde studied the yellow-flowered crop
called oilseed rape, known in the United States as canola and in
Latin as Brassica napus. Oilseed rape is a cultivated cross between
a weed called wild mustard, or Brassica campestris, and Brassica
oleracea, the cabbage plant.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen planted a version of oilseed rape engineered to
survive a weed killer called Basta alongside its wild ancestor (and
weedy neighbor) B. campestris.
</P>
<P>
   Fertile hybrids easily formed, and when jorgensen sowed the
hybrids together with the original weed, a second generation of
seeds was produced. These seeds grew to adulthood and turned out to
be impervious to Basta as well.
</P>
<P>
   Jorgensen returned to her fields the following spring and
discovered that this second generation had produced offspring of
their own, which continued to be herbicide resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite these results, Jorgensen and others remain sanguine
about the prospects of transgenic crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can put in genes that give the plant itself a better
resistance, for instance, to fungal pathogens or to insect pests,
then you can minimize your use of pesticides, and that would be
beneficial to the environment,'' Jorgensen says. And she believes
that as long as transgenic oilseed rape is carefully managed, it
can be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you spray very early, before the campestris flowers, you
minimize its potential to hybridize,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   But it would be unwise to grow Basta-resistant oilseed rape
alongside a crop resistant to a different herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then what you'll have is Brassica campestris plants with
multiresistance in very few generations,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   A weed with only one herbicide-resistance gene would, however,
still be manageable. As one researcher said, you can always destroy
the plants with another herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of herbicide-resistant crops creating the need for
spraying still more herbicides doesn't fit well with the
environmentally friendly image offered by companies like Pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some critics think that biotech corporations are actually
comfortable with that prospect because they can make transgenic
crops as well as herbicides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biotech companies, since they make the herbicides, don't
see it as a big problem, because it forces them to make a new
herbicide,'' says botanist Hugh Wilson of Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has been studying transgenic gene flow and its possible
effects not on the struggle between weeds and crops but between
weeds and rare or fragile wild plant species.
</P>
<P>
   Herbicide resistance isn't so much of a problem in this regard,
since weed killers are found only on farms. Of far more pressing
concern to him is the possibility that genes for resistance to
insects, viruses and fungi can be just as important in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that a spread of genes from transgenic crops
into wild plants could allow them to outcompete other species.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   One possible way to contain the threat of transgene escape might
be to bar certain genetically engineered crops when weedy relatives
already exist in a given place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no weeds related to maize in Europe,'' says French
cytogeneticist Anne-Marie Chevre of the national Institute of
Agronomic Research at Le Rheu. ``But we have a lot of wild species
more or less related to oilseed rape in the field everywhere.''
Therefore France has permitted transgenic corn to be grown on its
soil.
</P>
<P>
   The United States could similarly allow transgenic maize
soybeans, and potatoes to be farmed, since they have no wild
relatives with which they are sexually compatible here. On the
other hand, squashes and sunflowers do.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways that this policy might go wrong, however. A
desperate farmer might ignore the law and plant a transgenic crop
that can breed with local weeds.
</P>
<P>
   And crop-to-weed gene exchanges are only one kind of change that
transgenic crops can bring. Researchers have been developing a
transgenic potato, for example, that can fight off the aphids that
feed on it. The new potato produces a protein called lectin that
ruins the aphids' digestion.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhouse tests have shown that this transgenic potato can
reduce populations of the peach-potato aphid by half. That's
impressive but not quite good enough to allow the potatoes to
survive on their own. To fully protect their crop, farmers would
need to introduce aphid-devouring ladybugs.
</P>
<P>
   But as entomologist Nick Birch of the Scottish Crop Research
Institute in Dundee has shown, the lectin in the potato makes
ladybugs ill: After eating transgenic potato-glutted aphids,
ladybugs produce far fewer offspring and live much shorter lives.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even though he has shown how transgenic crops can have
harmful effects that spread through a food chain, Birch doesn't
think his results are cause for alarm. If ladybugs can also find
aphids in the wild that are unaffected by transgenic potatoes, the
plant's harmful effects will be diluted.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Birch thinks that with careful tests of their
potential effects, transgenic crops can prove safe and useful in
reducing our dependence on pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows _ maybe those witchcraft and Satanism theories are
indeed wrong ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   Contemplating world hunger from the vantage point of a
well-laden breakfast table is certainly comfortable, if odd.
</P>
<P>
   One morning last January, executives of Iowa-based Pioneer
Hi-Bred International, the ``world's largest developer, producer
and marketer of genetically improved seed,'' gathered at a cafe in
downtown Manhattan for a discussion about global food security.
</P>
<P>
   The three officials and a group of journalists ate pancakes and
muffins as Pioneer's chairman and CEO, Chuck Johnson, outlined his
vision of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business we're in is ensuring that the world has the
capacity to have the food it needs to survive,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   That future capacity, he is convinced, can come only from the
crops that companies such as Pioneer are producing: high-yield,
insect-resistant breeds of corn, soybeans, sorghum and sunflowers.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer makes some of its seeds conventionally, by creating
hybrids. Back in the 1920s, though, the conventional was radical,
and the typical farmer looked upon the newfangled seeds, in
Johnson's words, as ``witchcraft and Satanism _ until he got his
first taste of the yield.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past few years, however, Pioneer has been offering
genetically engineered seeds, which have genes spliced into their
chromosomes that make them more resistant to insects and weed
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson told the journalists about herbicide-resistant soybeans
and a variety of corn that produces a toxin normally made by a
bacterium known as Bacillus thuringiensis, or Bt.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, a million acres of the Bt corn were planted
in the Midwest, with an increased yield of 10 percent to 15
percent, thanks to the way the Bt toxin discourages corn-eating
insects.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer's vice president for marketing, Mary McBride, then
chimed in, claiming that these ``transgenic'' crops have the power
to increase food production in the developing world with minimal
environmental impact.
</P>
<P>
   Pioneer, as McBride put it, is creating ``virtual acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of transgenic crops claim that ecological and
evolutionary forces could turn these crops into disasters. Perhaps
the plants will prove so robust that they will grow aggressively,
like weeds, and invade other environments _ including a neighboring
farmer's fields.
</P>
<P>
   Virus-resistance genes could escape into weeds and make them so
hardy they'd outcompete endangered plants in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Antibiotic-resistance genes (which botanists insert into
transgenic crops as supposedly harmless markers) might escape into
soil bacteria and from there into those that infect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Crops engineered to carry Bt-toxin genes might trigger the
evolution of ever adaptive Bt-resistant bugs.
</P>
<P>
   Is all this worry just more witchcraft and Satanism? The only
way to know how seriously to take such doomsday scenarios is to run
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have only begun to do this work, setting up
experiments to see how readily transgenic genes and proteins can
escape the crops they were meant to help. The results thus far are
proving that the doomsday scenarios are not pure fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers are split over whether the results should be
cause for anxiety. Much of the concern over transgenic crops stems
from the promiscuous sexual habits of plants.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can pollen from one breed of plant fertilize another,
but different species can sometimes mate and produce hybrids that
can reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   Genes in one population of plants (crops, for example) can thus
seep into another population (neighboring weeds).
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s geneticist Norman Ellstrand at the University
of California at Riverside began warning of the dangers of this

<P>
   The night sky seldom offers a ``first'' _ an event never before
seen, even by the most grizzled observer.
</P>
<P>
   This past January featured one of those rare spectacles, when
the asteroid-observing spacecraft NEAR became the first
interplanetary craft visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the craft zipped in for a close approach (using Earth's
gravity to change its trajectory), the sun glinted off its large
solar panels, resulting in star-bright flashes in the northwestern
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fail to spot NEAR? Don't despair. While there won't be any more
interplanetary probes to view, this time of year offers a slew of
other manmade objects slowly crisscrossing the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't visible two months ago, and they won't be around
after August. But they're here now during satellite season, when
Earth's northern axis tilts just 5 degrees from its maximum sunward
extreme, allowing satellites as low as 200 miles to stand in full
sunlight even an hour after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four decades, some 7,000 satellites have been
launched into orbit around Earth. They deliver weather images,
monitor ground resources, provide telecommunications and
navigational aid.
</P>
<P>
   More often they're used by the military _ to spy on us even as
we try to spy them.
</P>
<P>
   Most satellites are invisible, but a few hundred are large
enough (typically school-bus size) and low enough (200 to 600 miles
up) to catch our eye.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest satellites orbit Earth in 90 minutes and take nine
minutes to cross the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites perched 600 miles up appear some 10 times dimmer,
take an extra 20 minutes to circle the globe and require up to 18
minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know you've spotted a satellite? Elementary, my dear
Westar. If it's a silent dot with no accompanying lights that moves
in a straight line, and if it crosses the sky in minutes rather
than seconds, you've spotted either an alien mother ship or a
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites sometimes appear to zigzag, but that's an optical
illusion resulting from imperceptible eye-muscle movements.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites travel every which way, but never east to west.
That's because they're usually launched in the same general
direction as the rotation of Earth, which gives them a free
1,000-miles-per-hour boost.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't circle the equator but are angled northward or
southward so they can fly over much of our planet in just a few
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Many TV viewers aim backyard dishes at communications satellites
stationed 22,300 miles up. Orbits at that distance are
geosynchronous _ the satellites orbit at the same speed as Earth
and so appear motionless. Don't even think of finding them; they
are a million times fainter than their lower cousins and hopelessly
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites can shine fairly steadily or wink on and off if
they're tumbling. And if they're tumbling _ and most do _ they're
no longer functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this space junk was always junk. Last October we passed
the 40th anniversary of the first shiny, useless, basketball-size
artificial satellite, Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sputnik was too small to be seen by the naked eye, and
the awestruck world gazed unwittingly at the huge discarded
third-stage booster that went with it into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Today over 22,000 pieces of unrecyclable debris clutter the
skies, garbage masquerading as fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   If you need help tracking the major satellites, the Web site
http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/spacecraft.html
provides current passages.
</P>
<P>
   Or simply go out as evening twilight ends and look around. After
only a minute or two you'll strike orbiting pay dirt.

<P>
   The night sky seldom offers a ``first'' _ an event never before
seen, even by the most grizzled observer.
</P>
<P>
   This past January featured one of those rare spectacles, when
the asteroid-observing spacecraft NEAR became the first
interplanetary craft visible to the naked eye.
</P>
<P>
   As the craft zipped in for a close approach (using Earth's
gravity to change its trajectory), the sun glinted off its large
solar panels, resulting in star-bright flashes in the northwestern
sky.
</P>
<P>
   Fail to spot NEAR? Don't despair. While there won't be any more
interplanetary probes to view, this time of year offers a slew of
other manmade objects slowly crisscrossing the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't visible two months ago, and they won't be around
after August. But they're here now during satellite season, when
Earth's northern axis tilts just 5 degrees from its maximum sunward
extreme, allowing satellites as low as 200 miles to stand in full
sunlight even an hour after sunset.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four decades, some 7,000 satellites have been
launched into orbit around Earth. They deliver weather images,
monitor ground resources, provide telecommunications and
navigational aid.
</P>
<P>
   More often they're used by the military _ to spy on us even as
we try to spy them.
</P>
<P>
   Most satellites are invisible, but a few hundred are large
enough (typically school-bus size) and low enough (200 to 600 miles
up) to catch our eye.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest satellites orbit Earth in 90 minutes and take nine
minutes to cross the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites perched 600 miles up appear some 10 times dimmer,
take an extra 20 minutes to circle the globe and require up to 18
minutes to cross from horizon to horizon.
</P>
<P>
   How do you know you've spotted a satellite? Elementary, my dear
Westar. If it's a silent dot with no accompanying lights that moves
in a straight line, and if it crosses the sky in minutes rather
than seconds, you've spotted either an alien mother ship or a
satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites sometimes appear to zigzag, but that's an optical
illusion resulting from imperceptible eye-muscle movements.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites travel every which way, but never east to west.
That's because they're usually launched in the same general
direction as the rotation of Earth, which gives them a free
1,000-miles-per-hour boost.
</P>
<P>
   Most don't circle the equator but are angled northward or
southward so they can fly over much of our planet in just a few
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Many TV viewers aim backyard dishes at communications satellites
stationed 22,300 miles up. Orbits at that distance are
geosynchronous _ the satellites orbit at the same speed as Earth
and so appear motionless. Don't even think of finding them; they
are a million times fainter than their lower cousins and hopelessly
invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites can shine fairly steadily or wink on and off if
they're tumbling. And if they're tumbling _ and most do _ they're
no longer functioning.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this space junk was always junk. Last October we passed
the 40th anniversary of the first shiny, useless, basketball-size
artificial satellite, Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   The first Sputnik was too small to be seen by the naked eye, and
the awestruck world gazed unwittingly at the huge discarded
third-stage booster that went with it into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Today over 22,000 pieces of unrecyclable debris clutter the
skies, garbage masquerading as fireflies.
</P>
<P>
   If you need help tracking the major satellites, the Web site
http://liftoff.msfc.nasa.gov/realtime/jtrack/spacecraft.html
provides current passages.
</P>
<P>
   Or simply go out as evening twilight ends and look around. After
only a minute or two you'll strike orbiting pay dirt.

WHY ONLINE CHAT IS WHERE IT'S AT
</HEADLINE>
 CPT- COMPUTERS-BOMBAY-COLUMN-TEX 
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  DEAR DR.
BOMBAY: I love to chat online. My husband, however, hates it. He
says he can tell when I have been chatting and to whom. Can you
tell me how he does it? I always erase the history, but he has
another way.
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ You Talkin' to Me?
</P>
<P>
   DEAR YOU: Maybe your guilty conscience tips him off.
</P>
<P>
   But you don't really have anything to feel guilty about. Your
husband is the one who needs to unclench and join the rest of us
here in the late '90s. For millions of people, online chat has
replaced street-corner chatter and backyard-fence gossip. And, when
you consider that the guy on the other side of the fence may well
be Norman Bates, it's a heck of a lot safer as long as you use some
common sense: Don't give out your phone number or address, and
don't ever meet anybody you chat with in real life unless you do it
in a public place and drag a couple of your friends along. Oh, and
prepare to be disappointed, because in a chat room nobody is who
they say they are, and if they are, well, they're probably lying
about something else. That's OK. You can be whomever you want, too.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might think it's unhealthy to be friends with
strangers from around the world instead of your own neighbors. But,
really now, what do I have in common with a lunatic saxophone
player who puts ceramic chickens and one of those stupid windsocks
in his front yard? I'd much rather talk to Mandy, the 19-year-old
supermodel from Argentina, about quantum physics, geopolitical
economic strategy and interesting things you can do with Jell-O. At
least she says she's a supermodel. For all I know I'm talking with
Margaret Thatcher. Where's the harm?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, back to your husband being a loon. He's probably blowing
smoke about keeping track of your extracurricular typing. Maybe if
he's got way too much time on his hands, he's actually figured out
a way to make you think he knows all and sees all. For instance, if
you chat on Yahoo! or any other place where you use your browser,
the chat site not only shows up in your history folder, there's a
good chance some of the pages are in the browser cache. All you
have to do is dump your temporary Internet files to get rid of the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Or, maybe you're using some sort of a chat program that can log
your conversations, and your paranoid little hubby has switched
that feature on and forgotten to tell you about it. Could be he's
truly insane and has some sort of program running on your computer
that records all your keystrokes and commands. The problem is not
whether it's possible for him to do it, it's that he feels like he
has to do it at all, or at least intimidate you into feeling like
he can.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to get a cyberlife. Try exposing him to chat rooms in
small doses. Find a topic he's interested in, whether it's the
Stanley Cup playoffs or needlepoint. Locate a chat room or channel
dedicated to the subject, and ask him to try it out. Pretend you
like the same stuff. He can even call himself ``Studmuffin'' if he
wants to. I bet he'll get hooked the same way you did. And, if you
want, I'll introduce him to Mandy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if anybody out there knows a way that people can actually
track your chats the way this guy claims to, please let me know and
I'll pass it along. Nobody should be able to get away with that.
Besides, I'd hate it if my recipe for Hot Jell-O Surprise got out.
</P>

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Cyberscene: Sedentary surfers can find fitness tips
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's something a little silly about turning to your
PC for advice about exercise. After all, if you didn't spend so
danged much time sitting at the keyboard, cruising the Web and
sending e-mail, you'd get outside more.
</P>
<P>
   But since the PC and the Internet are facts of life now, you
might as well use some of the resources of the World Wide Web to
find ways to get in shape.
</P>
<P>
   We'll start our Web-based exercise program easy. Just click that
mouse button -- don't strain yourself -- on http://www
</P>
<P>
   .tyrell.net/(tilde)fitness/ and zap on over to World Fitness
Online. This is a good place to start, because you'll probably
agree with the philosophy here. The notion, according to this page,
is:
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is a precious commodity, as is fitness. We want to remain
fit, but we also need time to do other things with our lives. Some
people put fitness ahead of everything else and become gym rats,
spending endless hours pumping iron, running treadmills, doing
Nautilus circuits, etc. But most of us want real lives beyond the
gym.''
</P>
<P>
   The practical nature of this page also extends to the sort of
features you'll find. If you want to get in shape without spending
a lot of money, you'll be able to follow the directions here for
constructing some of your own exercise equipment, including a
wooden stair device. It isn't as fancy as the step machines you'll
find in the gym, but you won't need to spend your hard-earned money
to get one. And, since you'll build the wooden stepper yourself,
you'll get your first exercise just from constructing it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as you'd expect, there are sections that offer exercise
advice, as well as a forum where you can leave questions for the
exercise experts who hang around this site.
</P>
<P>
   Our next stop on our exercise circuit is at a place called the
Fitness Partner Connection Jumpsite. You'll find it at http://
</P>
<P>
   primusweb.com
</P>
<P>
   /fitnesspartner/. You already know that exercise alone isn't
enough for good personal fitness, so the emphasis of this site on
diet and eating the right foods will fit right in with your fitness
plan.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also get the sometimes-depressing news here of how many
calories you're burning while engaged in various exercise
activities. That's because there's a high-tech calculator that lets
you enter the information about your exercise program and get a
fairly accurate indication of the calories you burn.
</P>
<P>
   You probably know all about personal trainers. That's the rage
now at the gym. These folks help you set up an exercise plan and
health goals based on your age, weight, physical condition and
personal goals. Well, now it's time for you to meet a virtual
personal trainer that can do almost the same thing. Just head for a
site called The Fitness Zone: Fitness Profile at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .fitnesszone.com/profiles/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll fill out the on-screen form with the same kind of
information you'd give a real-world personal trainer and, in just
seconds, get an exercise profile and an assessment of your current
fitness level. You'll need to know your blood pressure to fill out
the form, but you should know that anyway, since a visit to your
physician is strongly recommended before starting any new exercise
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Since -- right or wrong -- most of us associate a fitness plan
with losing weight, you'll want to stop by a site called Shape Up
America at http://www.shapeup
</P>
<P>
   .org/sua/. That's the emphasis here, losing weight safely.
You'll find advice and support -- along with cautions about trendy
diets.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, to get started on your fitness program, perform this
low-stress exercise. Reach out with your right finger, turn off
your computer and take a walk.

SONY INTRODUCES A MUST-SEE LAPTOP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (ja) 
 By STEPHEN MANES    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the years, a few portable computers have managed
to bring sighs of envy from onlookers. The original Radio Shack
Model 100 may have been homely, but at a time when stashing a
computer in a briefcase was unheard of, it drew crowds in public
places. The original Apple Powerbooks positively exuded cachet. The
expanding ``butterfly'' keyboard of the IBM 701C forced users to
offer impromptu demonstrations; the company's svelte black 560
models still turn heads.
</P>
<P>
   Meet the newest attention-grabber. The Sony VAIO 505G is less
than one inch thick and weighs just under three pounds. It takes
its slimness as seriously as a fashion model, and its industrial
design is the stuff awards are made of. The silvery rugged
magnesium alloy case has a lavender, or ``VAIO-let,'' tint. The
battery, a dark silvery-purple plastic cylinder, fits on the back
edge between the hinges. Its roundness adds a touch of whimsy
vaguely reminiscent of the new Volkswagen Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   This Windows computer is not much bigger than a computer
magazine. The bright, sharp, 10.4-inch active-matrix screen shares
the 800 by 600 pixel resolution of the IBM 560 line, but its
smaller size gives it a better chance of being useful in coach
class seats.
</P>
<P>
   The VAIO also comes with a 200-megahertz Pentium MMX processor,
32 megabytes of random access memory, 256 kilobytes of level 2
cache, a 2.1-gigabyte hard disk and a built-in ``56K'' modem that
leaves the type 2 PC Card slot free for other things.
</P>
<P>
   The price for all this miniaturization is a surprisingly low
$2,000, but a slightly fancier model, the VAIO 505GX, is scheduled
to be introduced June 23 at the PC Expo show at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center. It increases the processor speed to 266
megahertz and adds a fast IEEE 1394 port that few users will ever
need. Those enhancements do not seem worth the extra $700 Sony will
exact for them.
</P>
<P>
   Both machines will officially be available July 24. The review
units I tried came with Windows 98 preinstalled, but lacked manuals
and the very last of their software tweaks and had some problems
suspending themselves and awakening where they left off.
Nonetheless, they came as close to being portable dream machines as
any I have ever used.
</P>
<P>
   The big question mark with a little machine is its keyboard. At
just under 90 percent of normal width, this one is serviceable but
not without annoyances. The right shift key is undersized, the top
row keys, including delete, are downright tiny, and the layout
takes getting used to. While you master it, you will probably be
glad for the oversized backspace key. Though the palm rest is
comfortable and helps counteract the screen's tendency to tilt the
unit backward when you use it in your lap, the keyboard lacks the
silken feel of IBM 560s.
</P>
<P>
   I strongly prefer pointing sticks to the touchpads that Sony
favors, but I was able to adjust this one to be a bit less twitchy
than some I have tried. On one unit the left button was excessively
stiff and unresponsive, so I did my clicking by tapping my finger
on the pad. A compartment at the edge of the screen holds a stylus;
in collaboration with a program called Scribblepad, it lets you
write or draw on the touchpad and see the results on the screen.
That might be a lifesaver if you need to sign a digital document
digitally, but I found it tricky to use. An unlimited undo feature
helps.
</P>
<P>
   The hard disk's sluggishness sometimes delays keyboard response.
To speed things up, I would seriously consider adding an extra 32
megabytes of random access memory for about $75. The current
maximum RAM total is 64 megabytes; newer forms of memory expected
later this year will extend that limit to 96.
</P>
<P>
   A monaural speaker, a headphone jack, a microphone (and separate
input), an infrared port and a Universal Serial Bus port are all
built in. A port replicator is included and offers the other
standard connectors _ printer, serial, keyboard, mouse and monitor
_ but dangles from the computer, connected only by a cable. The
unit also comes with an outboard floppy disk drive.
</P>
<P>
   A matching CD-ROM player costs about $300. It uses a PC Card to
connect, but in a rare design gaffe, it requires AC power and
cannot use the same power adapter as the computer. One of the
portable PC Card CD-ROM drives that can run on batteries would be a
better choice. Clever stereo speakers that cost about $100 a pair
and weigh about an ounce each snap on and off the edges of the
screen like ears without requiring cables. They improve the sound,
but the volume is low and their output will not be confused with
high fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   The computer's battery life is surprisingly good. In my tests,
the purple lithium-ion cylinder that comes with the unit lasts
about two hours at the maximum performance setting if you avoid
using the hard disk much and about an hour more if you let the
power management software reduce screen brightness and slow things
down. Frequent fliers will want the double-cylinder auxiliary
battery that adds about five ounces to the machine's total weight
but lasts significantly longer and helps balance the unit by
sticking out a bit at the back. Its only drawback is that it costs
about $300.
</P>
<P>
   A button beside the power switch can be programmed to run any of
three programs of your choosing whenever you press it alone or in
combination with the Alt or Control keys. A flip-out door turns
into a K56flex modem that accepts a standard phone jack,
eliminating the need for special connectors. Software should allow
it to be upgraded to the newer V.90 standard at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   What I hope will not become standard is Sony's practice of
making the warranty last just 90 days unless you register the
machine to get nine months more. Batteries are warranted for a
measly 30 days, period.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming months, lightweight computers ranging from cheaper
Windows CE machines to pricier machines with bigger screens and
their own distinctive looks will vie for the spotlight. But for the
moment the VAIO 505G is one of the best deals around. And if you
want to attract attention with your computer, there may be no
better way than to flaunt Sony's skinny lavender dandy.

<P>
   The government's antitrust battle against Microsoft Corp. has
not tarnished the company's reputation as an outstanding business
that makes high-quality products. But according to the latest New
York Times/CBS News poll, a majority of Americans do think that
Microsoft is a monopoly and that the Justice Department should
continue to investigate the company and its business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Both in a nationwide telephone poll last week and in follow-up
interviews, people again and again expressed deep admiration for
the accomplishments of Microsoft and Bill Gates, the company's
famous co-founder and chairman. Yet the same people repeatedly said
there was an important role for the government to play to make sure
that fair play was maintained in the high-technology economy that
Microsoft has come to symbolize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates has made an enormous contribution to this nation's
economy, creating jobs and wealth,'' said Richard Denoyer, a
65-year-old education consultant in Evendale, Ohio. ``But you've
got to give others a real chance to participate in these high-tech
markets as well. And it's the government's responsibility to check
things out, to make sure that Microsoft is playing by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   In the court of public opinion, the burden of proof clearly
rests on the side of the government to show that Microsoft has done
anything illegal. Fifty-five percent of Americans surveyed said
that they had a favorable opinion of Microsoft, while only 15
percent held an unfavorable opinion. (The remaining 30 percent had
no opinion on the matter.) Most people said their opinion of
Microsoft had not changed as a result of the Justice Department's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``People give Microsoft enormous credit for what it has
accomplished, but they also recognize that bad things could happen
and that market power can be abused,'' said Nicholas Donatiello,
president of Odyssey, a market research firm that studies how
consumers view technology companies. ``It's pragmatic and entirely
sensible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll, conducted June 7 to 9, surveyed 1,126 adults
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Microsoft's business practices, 54 percent of
those polled said they agreed with the statement that ``Microsoft
uses legally acceptable business tactics to sell and distribute its
products.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, only 19 percent said they agreed that ``Microsoft
uses illegal sales and business tactics to force people to buy its
products and keep other products from being used'' _ a pivotal
point in the government's antitrust case. The remainder agreed with
neither statement or had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the 60 percent of people who say the Justice Department
should continue to investigate Microsoft are not necessarily
convinced that the government was justified in bringing a major
antitrust case against the company last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has contended that Microsoft has used
unfair practices to defend its monopoly in the market for
personal-computer operating-system software, the program that
controls the basic operations of a computer, and to try to gain an
edge in the new markets of Internet software and commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, to be sure, plays no direct role in antitrust
policy. Yet it is inevitably a consideration when bringing a major
case like the suit against Microsoft. Congress controls the Justice
Department's budget, and a big case that is seen as too far out of
step with public opinion could bring pressure from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Microsoft suit was announced in Washington on May
18, Attorney General Janet Reno appeared before a battery of
television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of that exercise is to convince people that what the
government is doing is in the interest of the consumer,'' noted
Robert Litan, a former senior official in the Justice Department's
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion, he added, also sets the limits of government
action. The Justice Department, for example, has not moved to break
up the big software company, as was done with the Bell System in
1984 and as some industry analysts have advocated in the Microsoft
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is not ready for something that drastic, certainly
not yet,'' said Litan, who is the director of economic studies at
the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   People are split almost evenly on whether the government did the
right thing in filing suit against Microsoft, with 35 percent
saying it was right and 27 percent saying it was a mistake. The
remaining 38 percent were undecided or were not aware of the case.
</P>
<P>
   People who said the investigation should continue but thought
the Justice Department was mistaken in filing the antitrust suit
tended to view the appropriate role for government as more a
referee than a prosecutor. They also regarded some of what they had
heard of Microsoft's aggressive business practices as part of the
rough-and-tumble of capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Dianne Tytell, a 48-year-old office manager of a dental practice
in Virginia Beach, Va., said: ``Bill Gates probably did overstep a
few boundaries. If you're powerful and on top, that's what you do.
He should get the equivalent of a parking ticket for that. But I
don't think he's really done anything dishonest. And after all he's
achieved, I think it's wrong for the government to try to tear down
someone like Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times/CBS poll does illustrate the high regard that most
Americans have for Microsoft and for Gates. Nearly five times as
many people have a favorable opinion of Gates as have an
unfavorable opinion _ 39 percent to 8 percent, with the rest
undecided or unfamiliar with Gates. The favorable-unfavorable split
for President Clinton in the same poll is much more evenly divided:
at 45 percent favorable, 37 percent unfavorable and the rest
undecided.

<P>
   In the case of Microsoft, familiarity breeds respect _ or at
least familiarity with its products does. On almost every Microsoft
question asked in the poll, the more that people used computers,
the more pro-Microsoft their answers were. For example, among
people who not only use computers but have installed software on
their own, 78 percent had a favorable opinion of Microsoft compared
with 55 percent of all those questioned for the poll.
</P>
<P>
   The high approval ratings for Microsoft, according to
public-opinion analysts, owes much to the perception that the
company is a standard-bearer of a resurgent U.S. economy in the
1990s, led by high-technology industries. ``Microsoft is the
symbolic company and Bill Gates is seen as the personification of
America's recent success,'' observed Daniel Yankelovich, the
public-opinion analyst. ``The captain of our side is Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans are technological optimists, according to the
Times/CBS poll, with 59 percent saying that computers solve more
problems than they create, while 29 percent say they create more
problems than they solve. Among computer users, 71 percent see the
machines as solving more problems than they create. And two-thirds
of Americans now use a computer either at home or at work,
according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Americans appear to be embracing the information age
tentatively, if not fearfully. More than half of all computer
users, 52 percent, say they have never installed a software program
_ a basic step in computing. While technology enthusiasts never
tire of extolling the virtues of computers as personalized tools of
empowerment, the Times/CBS poll suggests that a large share of the
computer-using public has no interest in tailoring their machines
or changing them.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait of many people as passive recipients of computer
technology may also cast some doubt on one of Microsoft's arguments
in its dispute with the government. The Justice Department,
Microsoft says, has overstated the advantage the company enjoys
because the main desktop screen that users see when they turn on
their machines is Microsoft's Windows. That first screen can be
easily changed or modified, Microsoft insists.
</P>
<P>
   It can, but the poll indicates that fine-tuning software is
beyond many people.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's market power is viewed with both ambivalence and
pragmatism, according to the Times/CBS poll. Monopoly, it seems, is
no longer regarded as an economic evil. A majority of those
questioned say Microsoft is a monopoly _ a label Microsoft itself
shuns _ but 77 percent also say Microsoft makes high-quality
products. And 58 percent of computer users and 67 percent of people
who have installed software themselves consider Microsoft's
dominant role in the software business to be good for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   A certain ambivalence about big, successful companies, and what
the government's role should be in policing them, has been a theme
of American public opinion for decades, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Christopher Rogers, a 25-year-old medical student in
Philadelphia, who seems little concerned by the dominance of
Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's Windows is a great product,'' he said. ``It is a
monopoly but not in the traditional sense of controlling markets to
raise prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rogers, like others polled, is skeptical about whether
consumers would benefit if Microsoft were to control the market for
software used for browsing the Internet _ a market that is a focus
of the Justice Department's case. Only 8 percent of those polled
said it would be a good thing if Microsoft dominated the browser
market, 41 percent said it would be bad, 39 percent said it would
make no difference and 12 percent had no opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft pushing its Internet browser onto the market with
every copy of Windows does seem like a domineering thing to do,''
Rogers said. ``And I do think that's something worth
investigating.''

   The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone
interviews conducted June 7 to June 9 with 1,126 adults throughout
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The sample of telephone exchanges called was randomly selected
by a computer from a complete list of more than 42,000 active
residential exchanges across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Within each exchange, random digits were added to form a
complete telephone number, thus permitting access to both listed
and unlisted numbers. Within each household, one adult was
designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been weighted to take account of household size
and number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for
variations in the sample relating to geographic region, sex, race,
age and education.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such
samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in
either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out
all American adults.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller subgroups the potential sampling error is larger.
For example, for the 315 most sophisticated computer users in the
sample it is plus or minus six percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of
conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources
of error into the poll. Variations in the wording or order of
questions, for instance, can lead to somewhat different results.

WITH A NEW SMART SUITE, LOTUS CHASES ITS RIVALS' SUCCESS

 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week the Lotus Development Corp. will begin shipping the
Smart Suite Millennium Edition, which includes the latest version
of the 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, word processing, data base,
graphics and other productivity software. The question is does
anyone care.
</P>
<P>
   Battered by the relentless onslaught of Microsoft, Lotus has
seen its market share in desktop software dwindle so low that many
analysts no longer bother to track it. Although Smart Suite has
often been praised by reviewers and users as a cleaner,
less-cluttered alternative to Microsoft's Office 97, Microsoft's
ability to tie the applications to the Windows operating system has
proved an unbeatable advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Smart Suite is to be shipped on Wednesday at a suggested retail
price of $399; the upgrade price for users of older Lotus or
competing programs is $149. In addition to 1-2-3, Smart Suite
includes the Word Pro word processor, Freelance Graphics
presentation application, Approach data base, Organizer time and
contact manager and Screencam multimedia tool. It also includes
Lotus Mail e-mail as well as both the Netscape Navigator 4.0 and
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 browsers.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the original IBM personal computer were driven by Lotus
1-2-3, which combined an accountant's spreadsheet with a program
that could turn the rows of numbers into charts and graphs. But
Lotus stumbled as the PC evolved. It was late to market with a
version of 1-2-3 for the Apple Macintosh, allowing Microsoft Excel
to grab that market; late again when Microsoft Windows took off,
ceding the PC itself to Excel, and late again when the market
turned to the bundles of applications called suites. IBM acquired a
weakened Lotus in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably revenue there,'' said Jeff Tarter, editor of
Softletter, an industry newsletter. ``But a lot of it seems to be
stuff IBM's selling to existing accounts. Or, in some cases,
they're counting as sales stuff pre-installed on IBM PCs, which the
resellers promptly de-install. It's pretty much just a replacement
market _ anybody who's got 5,000 employees using 1-2-3 who doesn't
want to convert to Excel.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lotus 1-2-3 was once the world's leading software program,
Smart Suite is a distant third behind Office 97 and Corel Corp.'s
Wordperfect Suite, said Ann Stephens, an analyst with PC Data.
Measured in units, Lotus' retail market share is 3.7 percent,
behind Corel's 26.5 percent and Microsoft's nearly 70 percent;
Lotus' corporate market share is 2 percent, behind Corel at 2.6
percent and Microsoft with more than 95 percent. In dollar terms,
Lotus has 2.4 percent of the retail and 2.2 percent of the
corporate markets.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Papows, president and chief executive at Lotus, says
Smart Suite's global market share is higher than these figures
indicate, about 7 percent in dollars, 22 to 24 percent in units,
and higher than Corel's share. He said 7 percent of a $5 billion
market was still worth pursuing, and a profitable business. But he
conceded that Smart Suite had been battered by Office 97, largely
because Microsoft could offer it to PC makers along with the
Windows operating system at terms no one could refuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft, by means that one must argue are pretty predatory,
has clearly conquered a majority of the marketplace,'' Papows
asserted. ``But there's a certain percentage of the marketplace,
who because they are Notes or Domino users, or for whatever reason,
choose not to give their software dollars to Microsoft. The net of
this is we take a pragmatic view and look for meaningful ways we
can add value.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reviewers have long praised Smart Suite's superior integration
with Notes, Lotus' popular groupware program, which allows several
users to collaborate on documents and other projects across a
network. The new release adds stronger support for Domino, which
extends Notes to the World Wide Web for e-mail and other functions.
It also adds tools that enable users to create Web sites without
programming, and it incorporates IBM's voice-recognition
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're using Notes or Domino, Smart Suite blows away
anything else,'' said John Head, technical director of Arton Inc.,
a consulting firm in Carol Stream, Ill., that creates custom
applications for large corporations using Smart Suite. He added
that there were still Smart Suite installations at Fortune 500
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus counts International Paper, Abbott Laboratories and Mars
among major companies using Smart Suite. Analysts say many
companies still use 1-2-3 even if they have adopted Microsoft
Office for word processing and graphics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The types of people who are still using it have been working
with it so long, they've invested a lot of time and money in
building things with 1-2-3,'' said Roman Sochan, a consultant based
in Burlingame, Calif. ``Their biggest challenge is to work with
other customers and partners who are now using Excel.''
</P>
<P>
   Papows said he had no illusions about recapturing the market.
Indeed, Lotus works closely with Microsoft to make sure Smart Suite
can take full advantage of Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows NT.
The Millennium edition is designed so that users can exchange
documents with Office 97 with no loss of formatting. ``No one here
wants to get in front of that freight train,'' he said.

CHRISTIAN GROUP FEELS NET FILTER'S WRATH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (Attn: Miss., Mass.)   (ART ADV: Photo will be sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (af)  
 By PAMELA MENDELS c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   Concerned that
children have easy access to pornography and other inappropriate
material on the Internet, the American Family Association, a
conservative, Christian group, has been a vocal supporter of
filtering products, software meant to cordon off the nastier
corners of cyberspace from users, especially young children.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So it was with some surprise that officials at the group
recently discovered that their association's own Web pages were
being lumped together with skinhead, white supremacist and other
``intolerant'' sites blocked by a popular filter called Cyber
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA Web site ran into trouble with Cyber Patrol because
researchers at the company decided it met the filter's definition
of intolerance, which includes discrimination based on sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the passages Cyber Patrol found offensive, according
to Casey M. Smith Jr., executive assistant at the AFA, based in
Tupelo, Miss., was the following: ``Every time our young people
hear about a `gay' pride event or `coming out' celebration, they
become less sensitive to the perversity of homosexuality and more
likely to experiment with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith concedes that these words are strong stuff. But, he says,
they are delivered in the context of the group's belief that God
loves all and are not akin to Neo-Nazi or Ku Klux Klan-type
virulence.
</P>
<P>
   Association officials insist that their viewpoint is a
deeply-held religious conviction that does not equate to preaching
hatred of homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The group asked cyber patrol's ``oversight committee'' to remove
the block, but by a majority vote tuesday night, the committee
voted to keep the gate up, at least for now. The committee also
decided to take another look at the AFA site in a month and to
review other pro- and anti-gay web sites to see if they meet the
filter's ``intolerance'' definition.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber Patrol bans up to 12 categories of material considered
inappropriate for the typical 12-year-old surfing without an adult,
from gambling to cult Web sites. But customers can pick and choose
which categories to block, as well as unlock access to individual
sites they consider acceptable, according to Susan Getgood,
spokeswoman for The Learning Company Inc., the Cambridge, Mass.
educational software firm that makes Cyber Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   And, she notes, in Cyber Patrol's case online publishers who
believe their sites have been unfairly blocked can take the route
of the AFA and appeal the decision to an independent panel that
includes educators, parents and representatives of groups as
diverse as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and the
conservative group, Morality in Media.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime opponents of filters, who view the products as clumsy
high-tech censors, are savoring the irony of the dispute. ``This is
yet another illustration of how badly the filtering concept can be
applied, even coming back to bite proponents of that approach,''
said David L. Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a Washington, D.C.-based group advocating civil
liberties on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of filters respond that the flap in no way undermines
their belief in the necessity of the products to help parents
shield the young from what they view as pernicious influences
online.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Cyber Patrol chooses to leave our site blocked, it will be
unfortunate, but it will not change our viewpoint about the need
for filtering on the World Wide Web,'' Smith said before the vote.
He called filtering ``an absolute must.'' Wednesday morning, he
stood by his comments.

Big Plans For Future Of Presidio 
By Tom Abate 
c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  The Presidio is a relic of San
Francisco's colonial past, but Jim Meadows wants to make it a
prototype for the cyberfuture.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meadows is executive director of The Presidio Trust, the
quasi-public group charged with converting the former Army base
into a facility for a variety of civilian uses.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who gets what already has become a controversy. But the
arguments so far have overlooked a hidden asset _ one that Meadows
thinks can fuel the Presidio's economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a high-speed fiber optic loop already in place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet age, having fiber in the ground is like a
building site being wired for electricity or plumbed for water and
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows plans to make this fiber loop the nerve center of a web
of multimedia, video and Internet-based enterprises.One industry he
hopes to kick-start is the creation of distance-learning broadcast
centers for colleges.
</P>
<P>
   He also intends to plug all 1,600 housing units on the Presidio
into this fiber net, so folks at home will be able to hold
video-conferences with their offices or with other Presidio
families.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Meadows wants to turn the Presidio into San
Francisco's most wired neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just some bureaucratic dream. Before he came to the
Presidio, Meadows managed the conversion of Denver's Lowry Air
Force Base. There, he created a fiber town with 4,000 wired homes
and many multimedia enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's an investment in the future,'' said Denver City
Councilwoman Polly Flobeck.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows expects to encounter envy and opposition from those not
lucky enough to land in this high-tech Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   But he promised, ``There will be a broad range of opportunities
for people across the economic spectrum to live and work here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, all of San Francisco will be like this,'' he added.
``The fact that we can become a test bed for that 21st century city
is a plus and not a minus.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Wired voters? &LR;  ``All things in moderation'' might be the motto
of the largest single voting block in California, a group
identified as ``wired workers.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the gist of a new survey conducted by the Institute for
the New California, a public policy group in Walnut Creek. The INC
reached this conclusion after polling a scientific sample of
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute defined wired workers as wage earners who worked
outside the home, used network-connected PCs on the job, and were
relatively free to organize their own workdays.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Mike Hais said the survey respondents who fit this
definition identified themselves as independents, Republicans and
Democrats, in that order.
</P>
<P>
   They were heavily pro-choice on social issues, and moderate on
fiscal affairs. Their favorite politico was Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or not: The Institute was co-founded by Morley
Winograd, a former Bell executive who now serves as senior policy
adviser to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Bookmark it! &LR;  CMP, the Long Island-based trade-press
publisher, soon will unveil a new Web site that makes it easier to
find electronics industry information.
</P>
<P>
   CMP has taken the contents of dozens of its pubs _ among them EE
Times and Windows magazine _ and made it accessible from a single
page. It combines a search engine with a Yahoo-like set of
categories that point to sub-topics like semiconductors, PCs,
finance, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Other Web sites, notably Cnet and ZDNet, put tons of great
tech-type info online. But I think CMP has a better way to let
people quickly zero in on just what they want.
</P>
<P>
   The site won't be open to the public until Monday, but Chronicle
readers can get a peek today at www.cmpnet.com/search.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Questionable taste? &LR;  If it's such a boom time in Silicon
Valley, why did a recent survey of car dealers find that the
lowball Ford Taurus was the top-selling car in Santa Clara County
last year, while the Mercedes-Benz E-class was 15th on the list?
</P>
<P>
   Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by
phone (650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail (abate(at

AGENCY CUTS BUDGET TO PUT SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lh) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission decided Friday to reduce
by more than 40 percent the budget of a plan to connect schools and
libraries to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Under bipartisan pressure from members of Congress who
maintained that the program would increase long-distance telephone
rates, the commission agreed to trim the program. All three of the
Democrats on the commission voted in favor of the plan, while the
two Republicans opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, $1.275 billion will be raised for the
program this year, down from an original maximum of $2.25 billion.
Long-distance carriers are required to provide most of the money.
</P>
<P>
   About 30,000 schools and libraries have applied for about $2.02
billion from the program. Under the plan approved Friday, fewer
than two-thirds of those requests will be granted, which will skew
the distribution of money toward the poorest school systems.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has already raised $625 million for the program.
Under the plan approved Friday, it will raise another $650 million
between July 1 and the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne E. Bradley, a lobbyist in Washington for the American
Library Association, said, ``Clearly we're disappointed that it
will put a lot of schoolkids and libraries on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally a relatively obscure offshoot of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, the schools and libraries program
became the subject of a hard-fought political debate last week when
four powerful members of Congress urged the commission to cut off
its funding altogether.

<P>
   AT&AMP;T Corp. and MCI Communications Corp., the two biggest
long-distance carriers, have said in recent months that they
intended to pass the cost of their contributions to the program on
to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That set off a blast of protest on Capitol Hill, aimed at the
FCC and in particular at the commission's chairman, William
Kennard. Kennard had already angered many members of Congress by
pushing for free air time for political candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard Friday acknowledged the need for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were to fund at the full $2.25 billion rate,'' he said,
``there would probably be some upward pressure on long-distance
rates. My goal has been to have both lower rates and more money for
universal service.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the commission and Congress have been testy
for years. The two institutions have been battling over the proper
implementation of the Telecommunications Act, which was meant to
deregulate many elements of the communications market.
</P>

<P>
   The fight over the schools and libraries program has become
perhaps the commission's most important battle. The program enjoys
the favor of Vice President Al Gore, who has taken particular
interest in the Internet and other forms of advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC blew it,'' said Thomas Bliley, R-Va., who serves as
chairman of the House Commerce Committee, which oversees the
commission. ``Thanks to that agency and Vice President Gore, the
American people, including less-fortunate Americans, are stuck with
higher phone rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the program contend that the FCC illegally exceeded
its authority when it established a quasi-independent corporation
to disburse money to libraries and schools. On Friday the
commission agreed to merge the schools and libraries corporation
into the organization that administers subsidies to limit phone
rates in rural areas.

REPORT FROM E-3, THE GAME EXPOSITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LONNIE BROWN   Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   c.1998 N.Y. Times News
Service   In the past decade, the electronic gaming industry has
gone from a few hundred-thousand Atari game consoles hooked to home
televisions to a $10-billion-a-year industry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowhere is the expansion more evident than at the Electronic
Entertainment Exposition, a trade show also known as E3 that
features all the newest and latest game gear. This year, as last,
it was held at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta the
last weekend in May. About 40,000 people attended during its
four-day run.
</P>
<P>
   (Although it is a game-player's dream, there were no kids _ they
were excluded from E3 this year. Sony PlayStation officials took
that opportunity to set up a ``PlayStation City'' exhibit near the
center so kids could see some of the offerings inside E3 as well as
preview new PlayStation games.)
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit filled more than 35 football fields of space. If the
show is any indication, it looks like the coming year will bring
more of the same in computer games, an increase of the CD-like
disks called DVD that holds more than CDs, and more talking toys
that are built around computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   My Interactive Pooh from Mattel is one of them. Pooh joins
Barney and Barbie on the talk circuit. He sings more than two dozen
songs and plays about a dozen games. By linking him to the
computer, Pooh can be programmed to say the child's name, and other
features can be customized.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel is also expanding on its Barbie line with Barbie's Photo
Designer Digital Color Camera. The digital camera stores only six
photos at a time, which can be connected to a computer so they can
be saved for future use. Once in the computer, the child can use
the photos in other projects or with Barbie programs to make
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   (For more information: www.mattelmedia.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers are positioning DVD to replace CD-ROMs. One of the
attractions is the ability of a DVD to hold more than CDs. Take,
for instance, the announcement made at E3 by Mindscape Inc. The
company said that this fall it will bring out The Complete National
Geographics: 109 Years of National Geographic Magazine on DVD.
Actually, the more-correct title would have ended ``on DVDs.'' The
190,000 pages of National Geographic will span four DVD disks. The
CD-ROM version of the program, currently available, covers 31
disks.
</P>
<P>
   Mindscape will also expand on the National Geographic magazine
theme this fall when it publishes National Geographic Maps, a
four-CD collection of every fold-out map published in National
Geographic. The company will also join the trip-planning arena in
the fall with the release of National Geographic Trip Planner
Deluxe for planning trips in the U.S. and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   (For more information: www.mindscape.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Well-known learning software titles for children and young
adults from Davidson &AMP; Associates won't be sold under the Davidson
name any more. The products, which include the JumpStart Learning
System, the Blaster Learning System and Fisher-Price titles, will
be sold under the Knowledge Adventure brand.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement came at E3, along with another from the
company on its new assessment technology feature being incorporated
into its JumpStart Learning System programs. Before using the
software, kids will take an assessment test so the program can
determine where the child needs the most help. Then the program
will begin at the most appropriate level for that child.
</P>
<P>
   The new test will be included in soon-to-be released revamped
titles, JumpStart Preschool and JumpStart 1st Grade. It will also
be in a new title, JumpStart Adventures 6th Grade. The produces are
expected to be available in late summer or early fall. The price
will be in the $30 range.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the company name change, the Web address
changes, too: www.knowledgeadventure.com

PRODUCTS CREATED FOR THE DIGITAL ARTIST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every copy of Windows comes with Paint, a modest little art
program that lets you both draw your own pictures and make changes
in images created by others. But ``modest'' is the key word here _
don't call on Paint to do any heavy artistic lifting.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you'll need software tools with a higher level of
sophistication. If you're serious about working with images and are
willing to spend some time learning the intricacies of these
programs, you can achieve some spectacular results.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at two software programs at two ends of the price
spectrum, and a low-cost drawing tablet you can use with either
one:
</P>
<P>
   _ Paint Shop Pro 5.0, $99, Jasc Software: If you've used
consumer software to work with images _ such as Adobe PhotoDeluxe
or Microsoft's PictureIt! _ and have been disappointed with the
lack of flexibility or power, Paint Shop Pro is worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   And doing so is a snap. A fully functional version is available
for downloading from Jasc's Web site at www.jasc.com. Grab it, try
it, and if you decide to use it you can get a registration key, or
order the disk and accompanying manual online.
</P>
<P>
   Paint Shop Pro has long been considered an alternative to the
pricier Photoshop, but it's always been a step behind in
capabilities. Version 4.0, for example, lacked the ability to do
layers, a feature that lets you lay one image on top of another.
You can change one layer without affecting the rest of the image, a
powerful tool when combining pictures or going after special
effects.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Paint Shop Pro has been easier to use than
Photoshop, and its developers tried to automate tasks wherever they
could. For example, version 4.0 of Paint Shop Pro could
automatically create a shadow effect, something that had to be done
manually in Photoshop.
</P>
<P>
   This new version, though, brings Paint Shop Pro to near-parity
with Photoshop. It now includes the ability to do layers, albeit
with a simpler system than Photoshop.
</P>
<P>
   It also borrows from other programs, such as MetaTools' Fractal
Design Painter. It has nozzles that let you paint with specific
objects. For example, you can lay down a row of dice, cars,
airplanes, stars or any one of several dozen icons just by clicking
and dragging with your mouse. You can add others, too.
</P>
<P>
   Paint Shop Pro will read and save images in almost any popular
format, including Photoshop files.
</P>
<P>
   _ Photoshop 5.0, $995, Adobe Systems: This is the Cadillac of
photo-manipulation software _ and it's priced like a Caddy, too.
(If you're upgrading from earlier versions of Photoshop, or from
the ``light'' LE version, it's a lot cheaper _ in the $200-$300
range.) However, if you are a professional who works with digital
art, or someone who's adamant about having the best, there's really
no alternative. Photoshop is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Version 5.0 is not a radical departure over 4.0. Instead,
developers have concentrated on making Photoshop _ which has a
notoriously steep learning curve _ easier to use. Many common
tasks, such as the aforementioned shadow creation, have finally
been automated.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe has tweaked some of the commonly used tools in Photoshop
to make them friendlier. For example, artists who wanted to
indicate the edge of an object in an image had to painstakingly
draw around those edges. Now, the pencil and lasso tools are
magnetic _ the program itself senses where the edges are and clings
to them.
</P>
<P>
   Photoshop 5.0 also has multiple undo capability, so you can move
backward through various changes you've made.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe also has greatly enhanced the text features of Photoshop.
Text now has its own type of layer, with its own capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pablo, $99, KidBoard: When it comes time to draw something,
nothing beats a pen and paper. But most computer users who aren't
professional artists still struggle with a mouse, a distinctly
clunky drawing device.
</P>
<P>
   Computer drawing tablets have been on the market for years, but
generally they've been priced out of reach of many consumers. Pablo
is the first quality drawing tablet aimed squarely at the home
market.
</P>
<P>
   Its drawing area is decently sized, at about 8 inches by 6
inches. An attached overlay of plastic lets you put images
underneath for tracing.
</P>
<P>
   The stylus can be attached by a cord on either side of the
table, making it comfortable for either right- or left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo comes with two great software titles _ MetaTools Dabbler,
a drawing program that's a subset of the higher-end Fractal Design
Painter, and Kai's Power Goo LE, a ``light'' version of the popular
photo-distortion program.
</P>
<P>
   Using Pablo is simple. Just press a button on the stylus to
activate it. With art programs designed to work with a tablet _ and
all the titles mentioned here will _ the effects are similar to
using a real pen, brush or marker. The longer and harder you press
down, the darker and more pronounced the image will be on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Dabbler is particularly good for this, because, like Fractal
Design Painter, it emulates ``natural'' media, such as chalk,
charcoal or even crayons.
</P>
<P>
   If you are used to drawing with a mouse, it may take a while to
get the hang of drawing on a tablet and getting the results you
want. But once you master Pablo, it will be difficult to go back.

CARDS BRING HIGH-LEVEL GRAPHICS TO PRESENTATIONS ON TV SCREEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I do a great deal of PowerPoint presentations and I have to
use an overhead projector. A few years back I purchased a PC-to-TV
converter. The problem with this was that it would only handle the
lowest-resolution graphics available. Do you know of any way I can
use my PC and a TV as a monitor that will display the high level of
graphics that PowerPoint needs to be effective?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several graphics cards available now that feature
what's called TV-out. They will connect to either a monitor or a
TV, and the TV function is designed specifically for presentations.
</P>
<P>
   Canada-based ATI Technologies is the most prolific manufacturer
of these kinds of cards. At the high end is its All-in-Wonder and
All-in-Wonder Pro, two video boards that include 2-D and 3-D
graphics acceleration with a TV tuner and TV-out capabilities. They
start at about $170 and go up to $350, depending on the model and
the amount of memory installed.
</P>
<P>
   ATI also makes a low-end product, the 3D Xpression, with
PC-to-TV capabilities, that sells for about $120.
</P>
<P>
   STB Systems of Richardson also makes a TV-out version of its
popular Velocity 128 2-D/3-D accelerator. It sells for about $150.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you're interested in notebook computers with TV-out
capability, take a look at Compaq Computer Corp.'s Armada 4200
series.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure when you're shopping for any kind of PC-to-TV device
that you get one compatible with the television standards for the
countries you travel to. In the United States, for example, you'll
want one that's NTSC-compatible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is a BIOS and how do I upgrade it?
</P>
<P>
   A: BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System, and it controls
the ground-level functions of a personal computer. For example,
when your PC boots up, it's the BIOS that begins the process that
pulls in the operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The BIOS controls such basic things as screen display, the
keyboard, drives and serial ports. Other system components, both
hardware and software, work with the BIOS to improve the function
of these essential parts.
</P>
<P>
   The BIOS settings are stored in a chip on your system's main
board, and are usually held in memory by the power drawn from a
small battery. If you've owned a computer long enough, you've
probably had the unpleasant experience of having to reset your
system clock each time you boot up _ that's when that little
battery has gone dead. In some PCs, your system may no longer be
able to ``see'' your hard drives!
</P>
<P>
   You can change some of the functions of your BIOS. Check the
manual that came with your computer to see how to enter the BIOS
setup screen. In most cases, you'll need to hit a key just as your
system starts the boot process. On computers that use American
Megatrends BIOSes, for example, you hit the DEL key.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good idea to write down the settings in your BIOS before
you make any changes. Altering the BIOS is not kid stuff _ if you
don't know what you're doing, then don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   How the BIOS works is determined by software that is stored in
the chip. A modern BIOS chip is what's known as
``flash-upgradeable'' _ it can be altered by a program that's
designed to ``flash'' new instructions into it. If your BIOS is
like this, you can usually download a copy of the flash program
from the manufacturer's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   However, it's possible that you will have to replace the BIOS
chip itself in some older computers. And in much older systems, you
may not be able to make any changes at all.
</P>

THE LITTLE BOX THAT CAN SAVE A BIG BUNDLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  c.1998 The Boston Globe 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regular readers know that I like to keep my computer busy. Even
when I'm not working on it, the machine is often toiling away on
its own, indexing the data on my hard drives or downloading some
free software.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the coming of summer, I find myself punching the Off
switch more frequently than usual. It's the time of year for
sudden, violent storms, with lightning bolts that can toast
microcircuitry into pumpernickel.
</P>
<P>
   I love lightning; computers hate it. A near-direct hit 13 years
ago wrecked the first computer I ever owned. Yes, I was using a
surge suppressor. Good thing too _ the surge-box maker picked up
the $600 repair tab.
</P>
<P>
   That's why you install one of these devices _ insurance. Surge
suppressors give your computer an extra measure of protection from
electrical unpleasantness. And if they don't work, you won't have
to pay for the damage to your hardware.
</P>
<P>
   A host of electric power glitches can afflict computers.
Lightning strikes, of course, but also harmonic power-line noise
from electric motors. That can alter the standard 60-hertz
frequency that your computer is designed for. There are power sags
caused by other devices starting up _ if your lights flicker when
the fridge starts up, you know what I mean. There are brownouts _
longer-lasting power sags that may occur on hot summer days when
electric demand is greater than the utility can supply. And of
course the power can die altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Still, don't go getting paranoid. Phil Hester, chief technology
officer for IBM Corp.'s PC Division, tells me that computers are
tough enough for run-of-the-mill electrical glitches. ``All of the
computers and television equipment and stuff like that ... has some
sort of surge protection device built into it,'' said Hester.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Hester favors some extra protection. For most people,
that means a standard surge suppressor that filters the electricity
going to your computer.
</P>
<P>
   But be sure you're using it properly. That means that every
single electrical device connected to your computer should be
hooked up to the suppressor. Skip just one of them _ the printer,
say _ and a surge can pass through it and roast your machine. Your
phone line can carry surges right into your modem. Nowadays, surge
boxes nearly always include phone line protection. Use it. And if
your surge protector isn't properly grounded, it's no better than
an extension cord. So plug into a proper three-prong outlet. The
better surge suppressors will even have an indicator light to tell
you if they're grounded.
</P>
<P>
   A good suppressor should have been tested by Underwriters
Laboratories to let through no more than about 300 volts when it's
hit by a 6,000-volt power spike. This is called the UL 1449 rating
_ be sure yours meets this standard. Of course you should buy a
suppressor with a lifetime insurance policy to pay for damages to
your computer. But that doesn't mean the device itself will last a
lifetime. Many surge suppressors use circuitry that loses its
protective power after a few years. It makes sense to buy new every
half-decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Surge boxes won't help during a brownout or blackout. For that,
you need an uninterruptible power supply. Once only used in
businesses, they've gotten cheap enough to consider for the home.
</P>
<P>
   American Power Conversion of West Kingston, R.I., lent me their
BackUPS Office product for a tryout. It looks like an overgrown
surge suppressor with six outlets and a heavy lead-acid battery
inside, but it gets the job done. I pulled the plug on my home PC
by way of a test. The battery drove the computer with two hard
drives, and a monitor and my Iomega Zip drive, for 12 minutes
before it gave up the ghost. That was plenty of time to do a safe
shutdown. The BackUPS Office sells for around $125. And there are
more expensive battery backup devices that come with software
that'll automatically shut down your machine during a blackout.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM's Hester warns that even the best electrical protection
has its limits. ``If you have a lightning strike within 100 feet of
your house, it's like having a small stick of dynamite go off
inside the electronic devices in your house,'' he said. ``None of
this stuff is ever going to survive a direct strike.'' Which is why
I'll keep on shutting down my machine whenever the skies begin to
grumble.

boxes nearly always include phone line protection. Use it. And if
your surge protector isn't properly grounded, it's no better than
an extension cord. So plug into a proper three-prong outlet. The
better surge suppressors will even have an indicator light to tell
you if they're grounded.
</P>
<P>
   A good suppressor should have been tested by Underwriters
Laboratories to let through no more than about 300 volts when it's
hit by a 6,000-volt power spike. This is called the UL 1449 rating
_ be sure yours meets this standard. Of course you should buy a
suppressor with a lifetime insurance policy to pay for damages to
your computer. But that doesn't mean the device itself will last a
lifetime. Many surge suppressors use circuitry that loses its
protective power after a few years. It makes sense to buy new every
half-decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Surge boxes won't help during a brownout or blackout. For that,
you need an uninterruptible power supply. Once only used in
businesses, they've gotten cheap enough to consider for the home.
</P>
<P>
   American Power Conversion of West Kingston, R.I., lent me their
BackUPS Office product for a tryout. It looks like an overgrown
surge suppressor with six outlets and a heavy lead-acid battery
inside, but it gets the job done. I pulled the plug on my home PC
by way of a test. The battery drove the computer with two hard
drives, and a monitor and my Iomega Zip drive, for 12 minutes
before it gave up the ghost. That was plenty of time to do a safe
shutdown. The BackUPS Office sells for around $125. And there are
more expensive battery backup devices that come with software
that'll automatically shut down your machine during a blackout.
</P>
<P>
   But IBM's Hester warns that even the best electrical protection
has its limits. ``If you have a lightning strike within 100 feet of
your house, it's like having a small stick of dynamite go off
inside the electronic devices in your house,'' he said. ``None of
this stuff is ever going to survive a direct strike.'' Which is why
I'll keep on shutting down my machine whenever the skies begin to
grumble.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Technology guru foresees smaller, more powerful PCs
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Technology is changing so rapidly, economist George
Gilder said Thursday, people buying the latest in personal
computers are still like cavemen tapping away in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of boxes sitting on desktops, the personal computer of
tomorrow _ say, five years from now _ will be as small as
palm-sized cellular phones, but far more powerful and versatile
than today's PCs.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the view of Gilder, a Reagan-era economist
turned technology guru who spoke at Thursday's closing session of
Supercomm. The telecommunications and information conference at the
Georgia World Congress Center is scheduled to return to Atlanta
June 6-10, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most popular PC of the next level will be ... as portable
as your watch, as personal as your wallet,'' said Gilder, 58, a
writer of books and articles for magazines such as Forbes. ``It
will recognize speech; it will navigate streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Operating with the technology of a cellular phone, the
next-generation personal computers will have wireless Internet
access, Gilder said. Thus, even without access to a phone line,
people will be able to transmit electronic mail, read newspapers
and search the Web.
</P>
<P>
   People will be able to write as they drive, using speech
recognition to talk into their computers rather than type on a
keyboard, Gilder said. Those who want to work at home or the office
can plug in their machines to electrical sockets and hook them up
to full-sized monitors.
</P>
<P>
   These evolving technologies are available, for instance, as
mapping and speech-recognition software. But Gilder predicted
they'll become more reliable and affordable as manufacturers pump
billions of dollars into the potentially lucrative technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Spurring the investment, Gilder said, is a scarcity of time.
People are so obsessed by time _ ``time to market, time to
retirement, Michael (Jordan's) hang time,'' Gilder said _ that
technology is emerging to help people burdened by everyday tasks
and companies scrambling to transmit vast amounts of information.
</P>
<P>
   Experts predict the Internet will increasingly perform those
tasks, with competition driving down costs for the rising number of
Internet users. One of the biggest roadblocks, Gilder said, is
federal regulations of emerging technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Rising to prominence as a supply-side economist during the
Reagan presidency, Gilder is an unabashed critic of federal
intervention in capitalism. For instance, he lambasted the recent
lawsuits by the U.S. Justice Department against software giant
Microsoft and by the Federal Trade Commission against chip maker
Intel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really going to regret inviting the government in to
supervise software,'' said Gilder, referring to the government's
allegations that Microsoft's bundling of its Internet browser with
its Windows 98 software is unfair to competitors. In the Intel
case, the government accuses the company of withholding information
about chip designs from three companies it was fighting in patent
disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Gilder also criticized television as ``the top-down tool of
tyrants,'' contending the general public has limited choice in the
programs it watches. By contrast, he said, the Internet offers
``millions of choices.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the virtues of the Internet will become more
conspicious as time goes on,'' Gilder said.

SURVEY FINDS LITTLE HARM IN SURFING FOR CYBERSEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYCHE HENDRICKS   c.1998 San Francisco Examiner   SAN FRANCISCO
_ Sex is definitely a hot topic on the Internet, but the Web is not
breeding a generation of sex addicts, according to a new study by
Stanford researcher Alvin Cooper.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead, Cooper found, Web surfers are looking for a little
cybersex entertainment, and the anonymity of the Internet lets them
feel more comfortable exploring sexual topics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like the Web is this irresistible sexual magnet,
where people who venture in are going to get trapped,'' he said.
``Most people use it for sexual purposes in a recreational way,''
much as they might watch ``Baywatch'' or flip through a Playboy
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper heads the Marital Services and Sexuality Center in San
Jose, Calif. He and his research team posted a 47-question survey
on the MSNBC Web site in April, asking people about their ``on-line
sexual behavior,'' what they look at and what they get out of it.
</P>
<P>
   The team was hoping to exceed the largest previous study, which
looked at 400 people, Cooper said. But it was overwhelmed by the
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 5,000 people responded during the first 24 hours,''
said Sylvain Boies, a clinical psychology fellow at Stanford
University who helped produce the study. The survey yielded 13,500
responses, of which 9,100 were deemed usable.
</P>
<P>
   Of the respondents to the poll, roughly 8 percent could be
qualified as cybersex compulsives, using sexual sites more than 10
hours a week and reporting that their use distressed them or
interfered with their relationships. Cooper said 3 percent to 6
percent of the general population engages in compulsive sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex on the Internet is like alcohol,'' Cooper said. ``It's not
inherently good or bad, it's what you do with it. If you drink a
glass of wine a day, it might enhance your life. If you get sloppy
drunk every night, it's a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper cited in his report statistics gathered by Relevant
Knowledge, a Web traffic-tracking company, that found 9.6 million
users, or 15 percent of all Web users, logged on to the 10 most
popular sexual sites in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty widespread phenomenon,'' Boies said.
</P>
<P>
   For people predisposed to sexual compulsivity, the accessibility
and anonymity of the Internet can make it easier to fall into
destructive behavior, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those same traits of cyberspace may help people feel more
comfortable exploring erotic pursuits there. That may be why a
growing number of women are turning to sexy Internet sites, Cooper
speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the survey found that men seeking sex on the Internet
outnumber women five to one. And they're looking for different
things. Men went after pornographic pictures, while women joined
steamy ``chat rooms'' for hot talk.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers acknowledged that their respondents were
self-selected, not a random sample, and all were MSNBC users, whom
Cooper characterized as more professionally successful and affluent
than average Internet users. But because of the size of the survey,
he said, he believes it provides a valuable snapshot of people who
go on-line for sexual pursuits.

YEAR 2000 COMPUTER GLITCH COULD THREATEN MILLIONS OF INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM   c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ Financial
experts warned Wednesday that the possible Year 2000 computer
glitch could threaten the safety of billions of dollars in the
stock market.
<TEXT>
<P>
   While corporations and government agencies are spending tens of
billions of dollars to solve the problem, investors still do not
know if those organizations are devoting enough time and resources
to fix the potential computer bug before Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors need to know if their stocks will have value,'' Sen.
Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said at a Senate banking subcommittee
hearing on the impact of the Year 2000 problem on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett announced at the hearing that he has introduced
legislation that would require companies to make specific
disclosures about what they have done to solve the problem and what
work they have left to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The millions of people out there putting their money into
these companies have a right to know if they're prepared or not,
and those companies have an obligation to tell them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts warn that many computers originally programmed
to recognize only the last two digits of a year will fail or
malfunction on Jan. 1, 2000, when the machines will assume it is
1900.
</P>
<P>
   Under this theory, the impact of the glitch would be felt when
one computer system that thinks the year is 1900 interacts with
another computer system that thinks the year is 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The theory continues: Because computers can't think, neither
system can understand why it is 99 years ahead or behind. Unable to
sort out the problem, the two systems would either stop or give out
wrong information.
</P>
<P>
   Some computers can be reprogrammed through tedious review of
their software code, but many devices have embedded microchips that
must be physically replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Yardeni, chief economist for the North American division
of the investment firm Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said the potential
computer failures could prove devastating for many companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way things stand, there's a good chance the Year 2000
problem will cause a recession about the size we saw in 1973 and
1974 when the Middle East cut off our oil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett described how the glitch could impact even a company
that had its computers fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens when a company that relies on just-in-time
delivery wakes up and discovers the trains aren't running to bring
them their supplies? Or when their supplier is shut down because of
Year 2000? Or when many of the firms that used to buy the company's
products can't anymore because their factories are shut down?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``That's not even mentioning the problems a company
could have with basic things like using a telephone or trying to
make a financial transaction or even if the water is still running,
all of which could be affected by Year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven L. Hock, president of Triaxsys Research Corp. of
Missoula, Mont., a consulting firm, said that nearly half of the
nation's 250 largest companies have disclosed no information on
their Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   Of the companies that did provide some disclosure, most of the
information was so sketchy that it gave no clue as to where the
firms were in solving the problem, Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 10 companies gave specific details on their progress
toward fixing or replacing bad computer systems and predicted
whether they would be ready by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just don't know which companies are at risk, and
neither do investors,'' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Congress require all companies to answer a
standardized set of specific questions on their plans for fixing
the Year 2000 problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The questions need to be extremely detailed, so companies
don't have any room to write around the truth,'' Hock said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Stout, a professor of securities law at Georgetown
University, said companies would continue to avoid giving full
information unless they are forced to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, companies are afraid that telling the truth will
scare away investors or tip off their competition, so they don't do
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (STORY COULD END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Bennett's legislation would require a
company to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell what it is doing to fix the Year 2000 problem;
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose a summary of all costs already incurred in solving
the potential glitch and how much more money the company expects to
spend;
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide an estimate of expected litigation costs from Year
2000 problems;
</P>
<P>
   _ Report whether the firm is insured for the problem and how
much it is costing;
</P>
<P>
   _ Disclose whether the company has contingency plans to ensure
continued operations in the event of a Year 2000 computer failure.

CUTS POSSIBLE IN ONLINE PLAN FOR SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
 (ATTN: Va., Mich., Ariz., S.C.)  (ja) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL  c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing intense bipartisan criticism on Capitol
Hill, William Kennard, chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, offered Wednesday to scale back a plan to connect
schools and libraries to the Internet and said his agency would
make a final decision by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the Senate communications subcommittee
considering his agency's budget, Kennard proposed stretching the
initial spending on the project to cover 18 months, instead of the
planned 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally intended that the money we collected in the
first year would be dealt with all in a calendar period of Jan. 1
to Jan. 1,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 30,000 schools and libraries across the nation have
applied for a total of $2 billion under the program. About $625
million has been collected this year, most of it from big
long-distance phone companies. The commission and lawmakers are
concerned that financing all the applications from schools and
libraries could lead to higher long-distance rates. Opponents of
the program want to limit spending to the $625 million already
raised.
</P>
<P>
   People familiar with the negotiations between Congress and the
commission said that Kennard had started circulating a proposal to
give the program a maximum of $2.3 billion over 18 months, or about
$1.53 billion in 1998. Kennard was also weighing a plan to limit
the program to as little as $1.35 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The commission set a Friday deadline for a final decision on the
program's budget.
</P>
<P>
   Senators at the hearing said the program as wasteful and
ill-suited to connecting students to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which emerged from the Telecommunications Act of
1996, was originally limited by the commission to an annual budget
of $2.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear since the winter that the program would not
receive the full amount. But until Wednesday, the commissioner had
not publicly discussed altering the timetable for distributing the
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful members of Congress, however, want to go much farther
to rein in the program. The chairmen and ranking minority members
of both the House and Senate commerce committees, which oversee the
FCC, said in a letter last week that the commission should suspend
the collection of money for the program.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that the FCC exceeded its authority in
establishing a quasi-independent corporation to run the program and
say the commission ought to focus more closely on protecting the
subsidies that keep down phone rates in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was sent by Rep. Tom Bliley, R-Va., who is the
chairman of the House Commerce Committee; Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., who is the ranking minority member on the committee; Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who is chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee, and Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the ranking minority
member on the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Speaker Newt Gingrich and Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader, have spoken out against the program and both
President Clinton and Vice President Gore have voiced support for
the program.

ONLINE MOLESTER GETS 18 MONTHS IN PRISON FOR LURING GIRL ON
INTERNET 
(EDITORS: `VALLLEYGUY' IN LEDE IS CORRECT)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSE HIESTAND  c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News   LOS ANGELES -- A
financial analyst known online as ``Vallleyguy'' was sentenced to
18 months in federal prison for using the Internet to lure a
13-year-old girl to a motel room two years ago, officials said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   During sentencing Wednesday for Francis John Kufrovich of
suburban Woodland Hills, prosecutors also said three other
youngsters, some from the Los Angeles area, are prepared to testify
about sexual relations with the 43-year-old. Prosecutors declined
to say whether Kufrovich faces charges based on those allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 18 months in prison, Kufrovich also was ordered
to undergo three years of supervised release, mental counseling and
biannual lie-detector tests about his contact with minors,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sentencing in U.S. District Court in New Haven,
Conn., Kufrovich apologized tearfully to the Connecticut teen,
saying counseling has helped him to recognize his problem.
</P>
<P>
   Kufrovich said he had failed to get the mental help he needed.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, now 16, told Senior U.S. District Judge Ellen Bree
Burns that the incident put her into a deep depression and gave her
anxiety attacks that require medication.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very composed, articulate and intelligent girl from
a caring, intact family, and that's the point,'' said Assistant
U.S. Attorney Gates Garrity-Rokous. ``If it could happen to these
parents and this victim, it could happen to any family.''
</P>
<P>
   Kufrovich was ordered to pay $25,000 in restitution to the
victim and her family for psychiatric care and counseling,
Garrity-Rokous said.
</P>
<P>
   Kufrovich's attorney, Richard Anderson of Dallas, could not be
reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the first cases in the country brought under the
1996 Communications Decency Act, which makes it illegal to use the
Internet to persuade or induce a minor into sex.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Kufrovich met the teen-ager in an online chat
room before arranging to meet her in Irving, Texas, where she and
her mother were attending a swim meet in March 1996, Garrity-Rokous
said. Kufrovich checked into the same hotel and invited the girl to
his room, where he tried to molest her, court records said.
</P>
<P>
   Kufrovich pleaded guilty in March to one felony count each of
communicating interstate to entice a minor to engage in sex and
traveling interstate with the same intent.
</P>
<P>
   Because Kufrovich had no criminal record, federal sentencing
guidelines called for a sentence of 12 to 21 months, which is
considerably less than the maximum 10-year prison term, the
prosecutor said.

Big Plans For Future Of Presidio 
By Tom Abate 
c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  The Presidio is a relic of San
Francisco's colonial past, but Jim Meadows wants to make it a
prototype for the cyberfuture.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meadows is executive director of The Presidio Trust, the
quasi-public group charged with converting the former Army base
into a facility for a variety of civilian uses.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly who gets what already has become a controversy. But the
arguments so far have overlooked a hidden asset _ one that Meadows
thinks can fuel the Presidio's economic engine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a high-speed fiber optic loop already in place,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet age, having fiber in the ground is like a
building site being wired for electricity or plumbed for water and
sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows plans to make this fiber loop the nerve center of a web
of multimedia, video and Internet-based enterprises.One industry he
hopes to kick-start is the creation of distance-learning broadcast
centers for colleges.
</P>
<P>
   He also intends to plug all 1,600 housing units on the Presidio
into this fiber net, so folks at home will be able to hold
video-conferences with their offices or with other Presidio
families.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Meadows wants to turn the Presidio into San
Francisco's most wired neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't just some bureaucratic dream. Before he came to the
Presidio, Meadows managed the conversion of Denver's Lowry Air
Force Base. There, he created a fiber town with 4,000 wired homes
and many multimedia enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it's an investment in the future,'' said Denver City
Councilwoman Polly Flobeck.
</P>
<P>
   Meadows expects to encounter envy and opposition from those not
lucky enough to land in this high-tech Garden of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   But he promised, ``There will be a broad range of opportunities
for people across the economic spectrum to live and work here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, all of San Francisco will be like this,'' he added.
``The fact that we can become a test bed for that 21st century city
is a plus and not a minus.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Wired voters? &LR;  ``All things in moderation'' might be the motto
of the largest single voting block in California, a group
identified as ``wired workers.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the gist of a new survey conducted by the Institute for
the New California, a public policy group in Walnut Creek. The INC
reached this conclusion after polling a scientific sample of
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The Institute defined wired workers as wage earners who worked
outside the home, used network-connected PCs on the job, and were
relatively free to organize their own workdays.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Mike Hais said the survey respondents who fit this
definition identified themselves as independents, Republicans and
Democrats, in that order.
</P>
<P>
   They were heavily pro-choice on social issues, and moderate on
fiscal affairs. Their favorite politico was Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or not: The Institute was co-founded by Morley
Winograd, a former Bell executive who now serves as senior policy
adviser to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Bookmark it! &LR;  CMP, the Long Island-based trade-press
publisher, soon will unveil a new Web site that makes it easier to
find electronics industry information.
</P>
<P>
   CMP has taken the contents of dozens of its pubs _ among them EE
Times and Windows magazine _ and made it accessible from a single
page. It combines a search engine with a Yahoo-like set of
categories that point to sub-topics like semiconductors, PCs,
finance, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Other Web sites, notably Cnet and ZDNet, put tons of great
tech-type info online. But I think CMP has a better way to let
people quickly zero in on just what they want.
</P>
<P>
   The site won't be open to the public until Monday, but Chronicle
readers can get a peek today at www.cmpnet.com/search.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Questionable taste? &LR;  If it's such a boom time in Silicon
Valley, why did a recent survey of car dealers find that the
lowball Ford Taurus was the top-selling car in Santa Clara County
last year, while the Mercedes-Benz E-class was 15th on the list?
</P>
<P>
   Got a tip, gripe or brainstorm? Tom Abate wants to hear it by
phone (650-961-2689), fax (650-961-5023) or e-mail (abate(at

 ENTERTAINMENT SUMMARY No 390 - JUNE 17, 1998  
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. MING-NA WEN GIVES 'MULAN' A SPECIAL VOICE Ming Na-Wen made
people cry in ``The Joy Luck Club,'' made them gape in
``Streetfighter'' and made them blush in ``One Night Stand.'' Now
she's making them smile as the voice of the title character in
Disney's ``Mulan,'' which is already heralded as one of the
studio's best. Wen talks about the new film, its personal resonance
to her own life, her struggles to come to terms with her own ethnic
heritage and how her father's death during filming made ``Mulan''
even more meaningful to her. Wan appreciates the fact that
``Mulan'' is the first Disney animated feature to star a largely
Asian cast, and that its story will shatter some stereotypes. By
Jeanne Wolf. 1,400 words + photo. (Not available in England.)
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
IN MEMORIAM : PHIL HARTMAN When the comedian Phil Hartman was
murdered in his sleep by his own wife, who later took her own life
in a tragic murder/suicide on May 28, the world lost more than a
comic star. In a warm personal reminiscence, Andrew Ryan looks back
on four interviews with Hartman and recalls a comedian who was
unusually well-adjusted and at peace with himself. He was,
ironically, at a career peak when his life was tragically cut
short. From Canadian TV Guide. 1,200 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 3.
DONNY OSMOND BOUNCES BACK Donny and Marie are back - big time. Not
only are the 1970's teen idols launching a new ``Donny and Marie
Show'' this September, but Donny Osmond has a major singing role in
Disney's much-touted new animated movie ``Mulan.'' Osmond, now 40
and the father of five sons, talks about the new movie, the
less-than-squeaky-clean reality behind the 1970's Osmond image, how
he has coped with life after teen-scream success and how national
humiliation on ``The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' led to the new talk
show. By Cindy Pearlman. 1,400 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
BETTY THOMAS : PUTTING WORDS IN ANIMALS' MOUTHS
</P>
<P>
   WITH 'DR. DOOLITTLE.' Betty Thomas charmed viewers onscreen in
``Hill Street Blues,'' then moved behind the camera with two hits
in a row, ``The Brady Bunch Movie'' and Howard Stern's ``Private
Parts.'' Now there's her most complex film to date, ``Doctor
Dolittle,'' starring Eddie Murphy. Thomas talks about the new
movie, the challenges of combining live animals, computerized
animation and a cast of improvisation-happy comics, why she chose
to remake a 1967 flop and how she coped with Murphy's traumatic
fear of animals of any kind. By Ian Spelling. 1,300 words + photo.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
THE X-FILES DUCHOVNY MAKES THE BIG SCREEN LEAP David Duchovny would
seem to have it all. As the paranoid FBI agent Fox Mulder, he is
the star of TV's cult favourite ``The X-Files,'' earning $100,000
an episode. He has become an international sex symbol, but as he
prepares for a major jump to big screen star with the $60 million
movie ``The X-Files,'' he has mixed feelings. ``I'm grateful for
the celebrity it has brought ... but it's taken control of my
life!'' he complains. By Ivor Davis. 1,400 words + photos. (N/A
Great Britain and Australia.)
_______________________________________________________________ 6.
HARRISON FORD LITE You can't spend every summer of your life
keeping the world safe from terrorists and murderers. So after
``Patriot Games,'' ``The Fugitive,'' ``The Devil's Own,'' and ``Air
Force One,'' Harrison Ford lightens up a bit with a mix of romantic
adventure and screwball comedy in ``Six Days, Seven Nights.'' ``I
always think it's time to do something different,'' Ford says. ``I
was tired of seeing that grim and determined look on my face.'' By
Jay Carr. BPI. 1,600 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 7.
WITH 'GLORIA!', ESTEFAN REVISITS THE UPBEAT 70'S 'Disco' is no
longer a dirty word. In fact, disco nostalgia is a growing trend
today in films, clubs and TV ads. Latin star Gloria Estefan adds to
that momentum with a new album, 'Gloria!'. ``It's meant to be
really nostalgic for the days of disco, but with the cutting-edge
sounds of today,'' Estefan says. It's high-energy music with
Estefan playing the role of reborn adolescent. She is good at it -
and makes no apology for it. It will tickle '70s memories even as
it tugs listeners toward the millennium.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
CAROLINE LINK'S STRAIGHT TALK ``Beyond Silence'' is a film about
communication - even though two of its main characters never utter
a word. Much of this exquisite family drama concerns the fragile
line between understanding and misunderstanding, those insidious
places where communication falters and fades between parents and
children, brothers and sisters, and also, in this case, the deaf
and hearing worlds. By Renee Graham. From The Boston Globe. 1,200
words.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Tips for joining ranks of the nouveau techno-chic
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once upon a time, if you wanted to be techno-cool it
was enough to have an e-mail account and a fast computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays that won't get you into the club. So if the real geeks
and gurus edge away from you at work, I am here today to bring you
a message of hope. You, too, can be a geek, even if you think IRQ
once invaded Kuwait and the chips you are most familiar with come
in a bag.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, I'll show you several free ways to join the digital
elite. Once you've followed these simple steps, Bill Gates still
may not send you a Christmas card, but you'll gain new respect from
all those who wear propellers on their hats.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start at the very beginning -- that dull start-up screen
on your computer. You'll need some new wallpaper. This kind of
wallpaper doesn't come with paste. It's the background image on
your computer screen. Let's replace the dull stuff Windows uses
with one of your favorite photos.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a scanner, you can convert the photo to a digital
image yourself. If you don't have one, most photography places and
some office supply stores can do the conversion for just a few
dollars. Save the image as a bitmap file (that's a file that has a
BMP extension). Then put the image file in your Windows folder.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what to do next. Let's say you called your file
CECIL.BMP. Simply right-click on the screen, go to Display
Properties and you'll find CECIL has been added to your wallpaper
choices. Just select it and there, big as life, is a picture of you
holding that big bass you caught last year.
</P>
<P>
   Things are looking up now, but you still have a long way to go
before you're truly trendy. Now you'll need your own Web page. It
isn't enough to cruise the Web these days, you need a home on the
Web. Personal Web pages are important holding areas for all the bad
poetry you've ever written, for the photographs no one wanted to
see from your last vacation. You'll also want to put in links to
your favorite Web sites. (Be careful with the last item. You really
don't want to put in your favorite Web sites. Instead, use Web
sites that offer impossible-to-understand technical information.
The more technical the Web site, the cooler you are.)
</P>
<P>
   If you are rich and foolish, you can get space to park your Web
page from your current Internet provider. But, unless free Web
space is part of your account, you can use one of the many services
that gives Web space away.
</P>
<P>
   There are literally dozens of outfits that have these free
offers. You can ferret them out using a search engine and the
search words ``free'' and ``Web'' and ``space,'' but I'll give you
one good site right now that will give you 6 megabytes of space
free. It's Geocities, and you'll find the free offer at
http://www.geocities.com/members/.
</P>
<P>
   You could take a community college class and learn to write the
HTML code needed to create the Web page itself. But, instead, let's
go to a free site and download a program called AOL Press. It works
like a word processor and can spit out a Web page in just minutes.
Just drop in at http://www.aolpress.com/index
</P>
<P>
   .html to get your free copy.
</P>
<P>
   You're almost cool now. But there's one crowning touch. Live
chat is very trendy. You can spend hours each night telling
flattering untruths about yourself to complete strangers who, in
return, will do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone can log on to one of the chat channels and meet
people. What you need is your very own chat room. Hey, it's the
difference between renting and owning. You'll be able to put a link
to it on the Web page we just built, and instead of meeting your
friends on some public chat channel, you can meet at your place.
</P>
<P>
   Just go to the following Web address -- http://www.parachat.com/
-- and, in just seconds, you'll get everything you need to start
your own chat service.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. You are now technically cool.

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  GATES: GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO BLOCK  ENCRYPTION ARE FUTILE &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories. 
 &HT;     By ANDREW J. GLASS    c.1998 Cox News Service   WASHINGTON _ In
<TEXT>
a digital age, crime-fighters can no longer count on deciphering
coded messages to catch spies or crooks, several of the nation's
top software executives warned Thursday.
<P>
   ``That's just a fact of life,'' said Microsoft's Bill Gates,
adding , ``It's a change in the world of spying and law enforcement
that we cannot affect. I realize that it makes their job tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates's views were echoed at a news by a Microsoft business
rival, Eric Schmidt, chairman of Novell, who declared: ``The genie
is out of the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt contended that U.S. officials ``appear to be running a
jobs export program'' by barring Novell, Microsoft and others from
exporting their most advanced encryption systems even as foreign
firms craft similar or even better encoding tools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several attempts to fashion a compromise under pressure
from the White House and Congress, law enforcement officials remain
deeply at odds with the software industry over the encryption
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI wants Congress to pass a law that requires all encoding
programs to carry a hidden ``back door'' that would permit its
agents to tap into Internet messages under a court order, as they
are able to do today with phone taps. The FBI plan calls for
providing a trusted third party with a digital ``key'' that would
be available in conducting criminal or intelligence investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Business Software Alliance, an industry trade that
sponsored the news conference, countered with a study which held
that a government bid to curb Internet encryption would cost users
at least $7.7 billion a year and $38.5 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we've said in the past, encryption policy must be guided by
the digital Hippocratic Oath _ first, do no harm,'' said Schmidt.
``The high cost of the key escrow system documented in this study
does not pass this test.''
</P>
<P>
   In return for a ``key,'' the Clinton administration is willing
to lift its strict export controls on more powerful U.S.-made
encryption tools. The industry holds that it has been slow to
design truly unbreakable codes, which could further advance
Internet commerce, because it has effectively ceded the world
market to overseas competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff led on Tuesday to a summit conference between
government and industry leaders, including Attorney General Janet
Reno, FBI Director Louis Freeh and Thomas Constantine, head of the
Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was sponsored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a
key player on Capitol Hill on technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   About all that was decided in what Gates termed ``a good
exchange'' was that the group would meet soon again. ``There wasn't
any agreement to change our position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group also released a report on the benefits of
electronic commerce predicting that direct business-to-business
transactions in cyberspace in 2000 would range from $66 billion to
$171 billion. By 2002, the study foresaw electronic commerce
reaching the $300 billion level.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Internet birth a reality even though most couldn't see it
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The first delivery shown over the Internet produced a
baby boy, but thousands who turned in couldn't see the birth.
</P>
<P>
   For those who got through, the images were abrupt _ they tended
to freeze _ and blurry at best. Still, thousands tried to see the
birth of 7-pound, 8-ounce Sean, the fourth child of Elizabeth, a
40-year-old woman who didn't want her last name used. Cameras were
discreetly trained on Elizabeth's side and in front of her hospital
bed, but nurses backs blocked any view of the actual delivery.
</P>
<P>
   America's Health Network, which put the delivery on its Internet
site, said there were more than 10 million hits at the Web site
throughout the day. At any one minute, 5,000 viewers were able to
log onto the site.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth and the network said they wanted to help educate
mothers-to-be and quell their fears. But those who logged on may
not have gotten much of an educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit here and say this is the proper method to educate
the public,'' said Peggy Hotz, the department director for
perinatal services at Crawford Long of Hospital of Emory Hospital.
``The problem with the Web is that no one is there to give support
or answer questions that may rise from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did not rise at the crack of dawn to follow
Elizabeth from her 6 a.m. check-in to her delivery at 10:40 a.m.,
was Christopher Rywalt, a New Jersey resident who tried to showhis
wife's delivery live through the internet last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rywalt, who wrote about the conception and development of their
first baby on a Web site called ``It's Just Another Baby''
(http://www.westnet.com/ (tilde)crywalt/pregnancy.contents.htm),
admitted that he did not find Tuesday morning's live birth ``too
thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could just be bitter,'' joked Rywalt.
</P>
<P>
   He had arranged to show his wife's delivery over the Web, but
the hospital pulled the plug at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural outcome of the Web site. It was in
conjunction with the book and so those who were following it could
join in,'' said Rywalt. ``We wanted to do it because it was a fun
thing to do. The tradition on the Internet is that people say,
`This is fun, let's do it because we can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Werbach, managing editor of ``Release 1.0,'' a monthly
newsletter that discusses trends in the computer industry, said
that the amazing factor of the Internet is that it allows
information and events such as a live birth to be broadcast, an
event that the original creators of the Internet most likely never
imagined or expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is the Internet allows everybody to be a
publisher. It lets people who would not have access to the media to
get the word out,'' said Werbach. ``It makes it possible to
distribute information, although information on childbirth may be
stretching it.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Internet provides answer to help wanted ads
 &HT;    By Mike Drummond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -- Xiomara Young joined the millions of people who
shopped on the Internet this year. But she wasn't in the market for
a CD, a book or a car. She shopped for and found a job _ with Bank
One Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   She had never used the Internet for job hunting and was pleased
with the quick results.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised they called me in a week (after submitting my
resume),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Dayton-area employers increasingly are trawling the
Internet for workers as a way to fish for talent in a shrinking
labor pool. They see it as a way to broaden their reach, in
addition to buying traditional classified ads in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, newspapers are responding in part by putting their
classified ads online. The Dayton Daily News will begin posting
online classifieds before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of free and for-fee sites on the Net allow head hunters
and job seekers alike to find each other in a way impossible just a
few years ago. Several, including JobTrak, link employers with
colleges, offering the next best thing to on-site recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   An unscientific survey conducted by Washington Twp.-based Right
Management Consultants showed that one out of five Dayton-area
companies post positions on Internet job banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet as job-recruiting tool takes on added significance
when mapped against a joint University of Dayton and Wright State
University study this year, which showed there are more than 48,700
local jobs available in this time of near-record low unemployment
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Right Management conducted a local seminar Tuesday morning to
expose local employers to the recruiting possibilities of the 'Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised at who's out there,'' said Jennifer Warner,
vice president of Right Management's marketplace resources.
</P>
<P>
   The session's four panelists from NCR Corp., Standard Register
Co., Bank One and Midmark Corp., talked about their successes and
growing pains.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Dalinghaus of Bank One has filled four positions this year
via the local NationJob Network (www.nationjob.com/dayton).
</P>
<P>
   The company paid $3,000 to have its logo on the front page of
the network's local site, although companies can post jobs for
free. Dalinghaus said she receives at least two resumes a day via
NationJob. As far as she's concerned, the company's $3,000
investment, ``has more than paid for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Hoying, global recruitment director for NCR, offered a
hard lesson for companies posting their own employment sites. In
its haste to launch an employment page about two years ago, NCR
tabbed a third party, CareerMosaic, the hottest job bank on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   However, when NCR built its own corporate page, it looked
different than its employment page.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the job site is not on the same computer server as the
rest of NCR's Web pages, meaning the company has to go through
CareerMosaic to update the listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a computer company and not even hosting our own
employment site, which is kind of sad,'' Hoying acknowledged. NCR
is redoing its entire Web suite, she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has brought the world's employers to home PCs.
Workers can look for jobs virtually anywhere in the world, any time
of day, increasing the choices of an already mobile workforce. More
advances are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   New software in the works will let job seekers keypunch their
desired position, salary, location and other requirements and have
their PCs hunt the Web for suitable jobs. The software will alert
users when the search is done and keep the list on file.
</P>
<P>
   Carletta Railey-Worthy, a Lexis-Nexis human resources manger who
attended Tuesday's session, said, ``When you understand that power,
you can see a day when everyone will search for a job this way.

(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  TECH COMPANIES SEEKING FOREIGN WORKERS  REPORTEDLY LAYING OFF
AMERICANS &HT;     By CHRISTI HARLAN and KIMBERLY MARSELAS    Moving in (w)
Washington and (f) financial categories. 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service   WASHINGTON _ Some of the high-tech
<TEXT>
companies that are lobbying to hire more foreign workers are also
announcing layoffs of thousands of U.S. workers, Rep. Lamar Smith,
R-Texas, said Tuesday.
<P>
   Smith, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, is using
the layoff numbers to bolster his insistence that companies
employing foreign workers take specific steps to protect the jobs
of U.S. workers _ steps that companies are strenuously fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so wrong with asking companies to advertise jobs and
hire qualified American workers?'' Smith asked in a news release in
which he listed 21 ``high-tech dependent'' companies that have
announced layoffs in the past six months. The list includes
Motorola Inc., which announced layoffs of 15,000 workers June 4, as
well as consumer-products companies such as Sunbeam Corp., which
announced 6,400 layoffs last month.
</P>
<P>
   The companies and their trade associations said Smith is making
a connection where there is none. Jerry Jasinowski, president of
the National Association of Manufacturers, said the layoff numbers
have little to do with a shortage of qualified U.S. technical
workers and the companies' desire to hire the best workers, no
matter where they come from.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who get laid off and rehired every day,''
Jasinowski said. ``Even with that, we'll have this shortage.''
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement is the latest skirmish in what is becoming an
increasingly entrenched battle between Smith and the business
community over H-1B visas, which enable highly skilled foreign
workers to hold jobs with U.S. companies for up to six years.
</P>
<P>
   This year's allotment of 65,000 visas ran out almost six weeks
ago, and companies and their would-be employees are anxious for
Congress to make more visas available immediately and to boost the
number of H-1Bs available in coming years. The Senate has passed
legislation that would increase the visas, but the House version _
written by Smith _ is stalled because of corporate opposition to
the requirements he would impose on companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I don't know what I should do,'' said Valentina Videva, a
foreign student who worked as a manufacturing engineer at Texas
Instruments Inc. in Massachusetts until her student visa expired in
May. The H-1B visas were gone before she got one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I pack my belongings and return to Macedonia?'' she
asked. ``Or will the H-1B cap be increased so that I can stay
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Videva spoke Tuesday at a Capitol Hill press conference
sponsored by business and pro-immigration groups that are anxious
to see the House approve more visas. Outside the conference,
Smith's spokesman, Allen Kay, distributed the congressman's news
release questioning corporate layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, which was not represented at the news conference in
Washington, does not see ``a direct connection'' between the
layoffs it has announced and the company's desire to hire H-1B
workers, said spokesman Lonny Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a direct relationship between one or the other,''
Hurst said. The company is hoping early retirements and natural
attrition will trim its work force to cure a short-term business
downturn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long term, we are always looking for the most qualified
people,'' including foreign workers, Hurst said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's legislation would require companies to attest that they
made ``good faith, timely and significant steps'' to hire U.S.
workers for the jobs and that no U.S. workers were laid off from
the jobs being filled by foreign workers. Employers say the
requirements sound simple. but could turn into bureaucratic
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said Smith believes that U.S. businesses should retrain U.S.
workers instead of hiring foreign workers for technical positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an industry where people are trainable and
retrainable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jasinowski, with the National Association of Manufacturers, said
the need for highly skilled workers is immediate: ``We're doing
everything we can to improve the training and education of American
workers,'' he said, ``but that's not going to be enough, soon
enough.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    USGA's big decision: Ruling body to weigh in on equipment
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Whatever happens with today's United States
Golf Association press conference regarding equipment, there's no
likely need to panic. Do expect something long-term, but don't
presume anything immediate. The blue blazers and white caps won't
be riding herd with the 156 participants today, ordering them to
play the first round of the U.S. Open with persimmon woods,
nonperimeter weighted irons, a low-tech golf ball, plaid
bell-bottoms and Ban-Lon shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation has been rampant ever since the USGA said it was
studying possible restrictions on the kind of high-tech, highly
successful equipment that has been helping amateurs and pros all
over the globe come a little closer to figuring out the game of
golf. The USGA is concerned that technology is taking away from
talent and that in 20 years you'll need a 750-yard par-5 to protect
Old Man Par.
</P>
<P>
   Expecting the worst, equipment manufacturers such as Ely
Callaway have been advising consumers to do everything but sleep
with their Big Bertha drivers. It's unlikely, however, that the
USGA, on the eve of its showcase championship, would unload a
blockbuster announcement to cause panic in the golf industry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite theorizing you may have read about oversized,
titanium drivers soon going the way of the T. rex, until the USGA
brass met this past weekend in San Francisco, it had not decided
precisely what would be said at a press conference The Golf Channel
will televise live.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA is not expected to announce any rules changes today.
More likely is the announcement of a USGA task force to study the
equipment matter _ probably containing some people from the golf
industry, to help deflect potential legal problems. Any future
mandates are likely to contain a reasonable grace period, probably
by 2000. Plus, any changes would have to be discussed with Europe's
ruling body, the Royal &AMP; Ancient Golf Club in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be be surprised,'' said USGA senior director of
communications Marty Parkes, ``if the announcement Wednesday is a
dot-all-the-i's, cross-all-the-t's kind of thing. Certainly, we'll
have something to say about the issues, things to look at, some of
the future steps. But if somebody is looking for a Holy Grail or
something that's going to tie everything together comprehensively,
I think they might be disappointed.'' Indeed, the timing of a USGA
decree to potentially affect the golf consumer is puzzling. Golf is
enjoying its biggest boom since the 1960s. People are diving into
the sport by the millions. So what if modern equipment makes it
easier for them and less prone to give up? Is that, well, ``good
for golf?'' And, seriously, what's the difference between the
titanium/graphite age than what happened when golfers stopped
swinging tree branches and discovered steel?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very difficult situation because golf is doing so
well right now that it's like an economy _ you don't want to mess
with it,'' said Gary Player, who, like many older players, agrees
with the USGA's watchdog approach. ``The only disadvantage I see is
that you will never be able to compare golfers. You can never
compare Bob Jones with Jack Nicklaus because one man played with
hickory-shafted clubs and a ball that went 80 yards shorter. You
won't be able to compare Jack Nicklaus with Tiger Woods because
Tiger plays with metal-headed woods and a golf ball that goes 15
yards farther on fairways and greens that are immaculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Hale Irwin, ``I've maintained for years that we should have
our own set of rules and standards. The talent of the player should
speak before the technology. You can go down to Pro Golf Discount
and buy yourself a golf game now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The equipment has gotten out of hand,'' says Tiger Woods.
``Guys who aren't that strong are able to hit the ball over 300
yards. It's one of those things that's leveling out the playing
field. It's not putting demand on shaping shots anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   High-tech equipment is, however, putting demand on courses.
Augusta National, for example, announced last week significant
changes to four holes (Nos. 2, 11, 15 and 17) in an effort to
reward accuracy over distance.
</P>
<P>
   Distance is the number one advantage high-tech equipment offers.
Although oversized, long-shafted titanium drivers might mean just a
few extra yards for some golfers, most pros say they gain an extra
15-20 yards. Golf balls are going farther on their own, too,
although how much is up for debate. There's no denying, however,
the fact that the PGA Tour's average driving distance keeps going
up every year.
</P>
<P>
   And so do golf equipment sales. Golfers spent $2.5 billion on
equipment last year, which explains why Callaway and other
manufacturers are worried about even the slight hint of a ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``A USGA rules change would definitely affect (equipment
sales),'' said Darren Jackson, manager of Golf Warehouse in
Kennesaw. ``It just remains to be seen how much. ... Most players
really don't play under the rules of golf. If you asked everyone
who walks in here if they played in a USGA-sanctioned tournament,
maybe one out of 100 would say yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you've still got people who will walk in and ask for
whatever clubs they saw (professional players) using.''

FUEL CELL WILL SUPPLY POWER TO N.Y. TEST HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ART ADV: Graphic showing how a fuel cell works is being sent to
NYT graphics clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.) 
(th) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time, an energy technology called a
fuel cell will supply all the power to a suburban house, another
sign that fuel cells are on the verge of acceptance as an
economical alternative to traditional energy sources.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of fuel cells _ which convert liquid fuel into
electricity through a chemical reaction rather than combustion _
has been around for more than 100 years. But until recently, fuel
cells were so expensive that it was practical only for NASA's
specialized use on space missions. But the cells being tested now
are powerful, flexible and reliable enough to work as an affordable
earth-bound energy source.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a team of engineers will cut off the electricity
the local utility company provides to a brick ranch-style house in
Latham, N.Y., and switch on a back-porch component that looks more
like a home central air-conditioning unit than the small chemical
plant it really is.
</P>
<P>
   Developments in the past few weeks include the first commercial
sale of a fuel cell for remote power (to the New Jersey Department
of Transportation, for a traffic warning sign) and the first
street-ready car powered by a fuel cell (built by students at
Humboldt State University in California). And in April, Ford put
$420 million into Ballard Power Systems, a fuel cell company in
Vancouver, B.C., in which Daimler-Benz already has a major
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Energy Department, which is helping to pay for
the test in Latham, say they have high hopes that within a few
years thousands of homes will be drawing electric power from fuel
cells powered by natural gas or propane, cutting pollution and
consuming less fuel than conventional energy production.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year, we've seen significant breakthroughs,'' said
Energy Secretary Federico Pena in a telephone interview. ``We're
going to see fuel cells in homes, cars and other uses much sooner
than we had predicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reicher, the assistant secretary for energy efficiency and
renewable energy, said, ``The launch of a fuel-cell-powered house
is up there with the introduction of the electric refrigerator, the
room air-conditioner and the fluorescent light.''
</P>
<P>
   What has made fuel cells more practical has been improvements in
the gossamer-thin components, which look like plastic food wrap or
aluminum foil, that are used to turn a basic chemical reaction _
the combination of oxygen and hydrogen to make water _ into the
basis of an energy revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the fuel cell being used in house in Latham and
being studied for use in automobiles is called a proton-exchange
membrane. When a hydrogen atom _ one proton and one electron _ is
pressed against that membrane, the proton passes through and the
electron is left behind. That creates a positive charge on one side
of the membrane and a negative charge on the other; wire them
together, and the result is a flow of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Leonard, the program supervisor for fuel cells at
California's South Coast Air Quality Management District, one of
many government agencies eagerly watching the research, said:
``Splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen is a simple process that
takes electricity. Combining them to make water and electricity,
well, you don't get much simpler than that. I don't think there are
many doubters.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Michael Walsh, a mechanical engineer who is a
consultant to the company running the Latham test, Plug Power, and
who lives in the house five days a week with, among other devices,
a stereo, a personal computer and a clock radio that wakes him in
the morning. They will operate the same, whatever the electricity
source, he said, and people inside the house ``won't know whether
we are running on the grid or not.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the breakthroughs, fuel cells are still much too
expensive for everyday use. The car companies, which would probably
be the biggest users of an efficient fuel cell, say that they still
cost roughly 100 times more per horsepower than an internal
combustion engine does. Chrysler, for example, figures that each
car-sized fuel-cell stack it buys costs $170,000. And running
houses on fuel cells is substantially more expensive than relying
on power from conventional utility plants.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power will not say what its prototype cost, arguing that
the figure is about as relevant as the cost of producing the first
automobile of a model year; it is astronomical but allows the
production of thousands more units at lower cost. Plug Power
predicts that it can commercialize fuel cells for houses by 2000,
at a cost of $3,000 to $5,000 each. Detroit Edison, a part-owner of
Plug Power, plans to purchase 30,000 to 50,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey company, H-Power, also hopes for mass sales. In
March it made what it describes as the first ever unsubsidized,
fully commercial sale of a fuel cell that will supply energy for a
trailer-mounted highway sign, the kind that are commonly used to
warn of construction projects along the roadway. The company will
supply 65 of them for $759,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an arms-length sale, with no subsidies, with a warranty
and all the aspects of a commercial sale,'' said Arthur Kaufman, an
executive at H-Power.

NEW YORK TIMES ENTERS CROWDED LOCAL INTERNET MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (ja) 
 By SAUL HANSELL  c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Entering a market crowded with some of the biggest
companies in cyberspace, The New York Times Co. said Monday that it
would introduce an Internet service about entertainment,
restaurants and shopping in New York City and its suburbs. The
site, called New York Today, will be available, starting Tuesday,
at www.nytoday.com.
</P>
<P>
   The service will compete with New York Sidewalk from Microsoft,
Digital Cities New York from America Online and Citysearch New York
from Citisearch, a privately held company. All the companies are
seeking a share of the rich market for local advertising, which
includes classified advertising, yellow pages listings, outdoor,
broadcast and print ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local advertising is the biggest and most profitable market
for advertising,'' said Brian Oakes, an analyst with Lehman Bros.
who follows newspapers and Internet companies. ``It is critically
important for newspapers to win the local market, both in print and
online.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers may have an edge over technology companies because of
their history and reputation in the cities they serve, analysts
said. ``One of the problems for all these local arts and
entertainment sites is that they all look the same,'' said Patrick
Keane, an analyst with Jupiter Communications, a New York research
firm. ``The Times has an established brand, while the others have
to build theirs from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Donaghy, the general manager of New York Today, said that
he hoped that the breadth of the news and reviews about New York
events written for The New York Times would distinguish the site
from the competition. But Donaghy, said the company expected that
the most important advantage would be technology that allows each
user to customize the service to see both information and
advertising related to the user's own interests.
</P>
<P>
   The site is designed to look like an appointment calendar, with
weather forecasts, arts events and other information listed by
date.
</P>
<P>
   In one unusual feature, advertisers can have their sales and
other promotional events mixed in with the arts and entertainment
listings. Users can see a list of these sales and, if they choose,
have sales for categories of their choice displayed when they first
enter the site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the calendar listings, New York Today has a
number of other close links between advertising and the site's
editorial content. For example, a user who searches the classified
advertising listings of The Times for, say, condominiums in
Greenwich Village will also see advertisements offering listings of
the same type of property from several real estate brokers.
</P>
<P>
   That advertising will be marked as such and displayed in red
type, while editorial content will be in blue type.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Nisenholtz, the president of The New York Times
Electronic Media Co., said that such links were a service to users
in the long tradition of publishing. ``People often buy the
newspaper as much to read the ads as to read the news,'' he said.

JAPAN'S TROUBLE IS THAT IT IS LEADERLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Western governments have been unanimous in demanding
that Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto initiate sweeping
reforms designed to rescue his country's critically sagging economy
before it drags down the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is that Hashimoto, like most of his
predecessors, lacks both the authority and prestige even to
contemplate such a task.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto is, in reality, a minor personage, chosen as a
figurehead leader precisely because his political clout is all but
nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   That is how most post-World War II Tokyo governments have
operated: The real power brokers behind the scenes nominate straw
men to head the government because they're expendable and offer
little prospect of interfering with the authentic policymakers, who
have usually been potent and unassailable bureaucrats, invisible to
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Official leaders like Hashimoto come and go, forgotten soon
after they've left office.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, many Western officials are either ignorant of how
Japan is really run or have no idea of what to do about it. ``Does
one tell a (Japanese) cabinet minister that we are aware he is a
puppet and that we wish to deal with someone with genuine
authority?'' asked Edouard Lejeune, a retired French diplomat who
served in Tokyo. ``Obviously, that is impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   According to historian Richard Eluard, a specialist on Japan,
politics there ``have always been a shadow play, with the true
makers and shakers moving silently in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the past half-century, the Liberal Democratic Party
has officially monopolized power. However, the LDP is itself
divided into numerous factions, warring against one another and
each allied to a different group of bureaucrats. Hashimoto is a
junior member of one of these factions. His status stems from his
ranking within the party and not from the fact that he is the
current prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hashimoto's government has come up with several plans to
revive the economy, but all have been half-hearted and some even
contradictory _ reflecting the contending vested interests involved
in drafting them,'' explained Eluard, who has written several books
on Japan as well as Asia. ``The inevitable consequence is that
conditions have steadily worsened. Hashimoto has been little more
than an ineffectual bystander, having to accept what he was
given.''
</P>
<P>
   American and other worried Western officials have agreed for
some time that Japan's pressing need is to stimulate domestic
demand for goods and services. Japanese consumers have zipped up
their wallets and aren't buying _ partly because of their lack of
confidence in their rulers, exacerbated now by the sinking yen.
</P>
<P>
   But increasing consumer demand would mean lowering taxes and
relaxing monopoly conditions, which have kept prices and profit
margins much higher than in many other countries. But clamping down
on monopolies is strongly opposed by powerful bureaucrats in the
finance ministry, the ministry of industry and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   So for the moment, Western pleas are getting little response.

ON THE SCULLY SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(ATTEN: Moved for use by Escondido.) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``She's definitely buttoned-down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Emmy Award-winning ``X-Files'' star Gillian Anderson
describes the role that's made her rich, famous, a heroine of young
women and the dreamgirl of cyberactive young men everywhere like
she was objectively observing some odd clinical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, of course, comes off pretty no-nonsense herself. If it
weren't a part of her personality, she couldn't pull off that
special panache _ brainy, skeptical, stone-facedly self-controlled
_ that makes FBI agent Dana Scully one of television's most
fascinating and groundbreaking characters.
</P>
<P>
   But you can also detect contradictions and banked fires in the
29-year-old actress. Given the right stimulus, a wild side could
emerge, something Scully might deem as alien as a sewer-dwelling
human tapeworm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my outlets for any residual rebelliousness that crops
up in my daily life,'' Anderson says, tantalizingly declining to
give examples. ``But the course of events in one's life and the
degree of responsibilities one takes on sort of dictate how one can
or cannot be. Motherhood, becoming a scrutinized celebrity, having
to show up every day for the show ... I do miss the chance to just
go off and do something wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Now add to the list of Anderson's burgeoning responsibilities
that of movie star. But even that has more riding on it than your
average TV actor's initial forays into the costlier, higher-stakes
realm of feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and David Duchovny headline a $70 million film version
of their show, also called ``The X-Files,'' that opens Friday. Even
though there are many factors that will govern its commercial fate,
the industry will be judging how well the actors who play the
world's favorite unexplained phenomena-investigating,
conspiracy-chasing,
pathologically-reluctant-to-admit-they-adore-each-other couple come
off on the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who reportedly was paid a tidy $4 million for her
first major film role, is typically cool about the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge was to come up with a script that appealed to
both the pre-existing television audience and the people who have
never seen the series before,'' she says, looking Scully stylish in
a white business blouse and modestly slit skirt. ``I think Chris
(Carter, the show's creator and movie's producer) and Frank
(Spotnitz, the veteran ``X'' scribe who co-wrote the film with
Carter) have absolutely stepped up to the plate in terms of that.
But I don't see there being any risk for me in doing the film at
all. I'm very happy with what I've seen _ and excited by it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Scully and Duchovny's Fox Mulder have been
reassigned to an anti-terrorist unit following the destruction of
the X-Files in last season's closing episode of the show. But that
doesn't stop them from getting involved in another alarming
operation rife with alien colonizers and their apparent allies, the
international Syndicate of rich, powerful, ruthless and mysterious
men.
</P>
<P>
   Ranging from a bombed-out building in Dallas to a bizarre
experimental facility beneath the Antarctic snowpack to FBI hearing
rooms in Washington where, as usual, Mulder and Scully have a lot
of explaining to do, the movie indeed delivers its share of summer
entertainment excitement. But the scene that may excite X-Philes
most involves a close encounter between Scully and Mulder in his
apartment building's hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleasantly struck by the love story within the
film,'' Anderson says. ``To me, it seemed stronger than it is in
the series. There was an apparent intimacy between the two of us
that I thought really added an extra element _ and which is
something you don't see very often in an action adventure film.''
</P>
<P>
   Beautifully put. But don't think Anderson is about to let
romantic notions run away with Scully's better judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A love affair would ruin the show!'' she insists. ``When would
we talk about it? When would we kiss? Flying around a corner and
just before we shoot an alien, we're going to smooch? I don't think
so. We come closer, then we pull apart in the series constantly.
We're in this dance together, and that's how it works.''
</P>
<P>
   In real life, Anderson has been known to date several of the
series' guest actors. She was briefly married to one of the show's
assistant art directors, Clyde Klotz. The union produced daughter
Piper Maru, whom Anderson says ``teaches me a lot, mostly about
unconditional love and patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Professional success and the accompanying fame has put an
unexpected damper on her social life, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tricky, it's a big issue,'' she reveals. ``I've
experienced that a lot of men are threatened by a woman who makes
more money than they do over the long haul. So that's something
that needs to be discussed and considered when you're thinking of
being in a relationship with somebody. But then, when you go out on
a date with someone and you're not quite sure if it's going to work
out or not, the press on it forces the situation one way or
another.'' &QL; 
Then there's that other relationship the media can't seem to get
enough of: the supposedly frosty one between Anderson and Duchovny.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shifts constantly, on a daily basis,'' Anderson
says, by way of not going on record as liking her co-star. ``There
have been some absurd things written about our relationship, and
there have been some very accurate things written about our
relationship. I don't think anybody can really understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Producer Carter gives it the old college try.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relationships are always difficult, I don't care who they
are,'' says the man who supposedly knows all the secrets of the
``X-Files'' universe. ``Any relationship that is 5 years old has
had its stresses and strains. But the fact that we're all still
together, and they're friends and they work together on a daily
basis I think suggests that it's a very healthy relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been as vital to ``The X-Files'' health as the show
has been to her career. Born in Chicago and raised in London,
Puerto Rico and Michigan, she studied acting at the Windy City's
famed Goodman Theater School.
</P>
<P>
   She was also a complete punk at the time _ black clothes, Mohawk
hairdo, a piercing here and there _ and that decidedly
un-Scully-like presentation attitude traveled with her to L.A.
Though praised now for the exponential improvement in her fashion
taste over the last couple of years, initially Anderson was hardly
a casting director's dream.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter saw something in the grungy looking yet
self-possessed redhead at that first audition half a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a seriousness to her bearing that I knew was
Scully,'' he says. ``I knew she was someone who could deliver the
science believably. And she was, for me, not the kind of tootsie
that television likes to cast in male-female relationships. She had
it all.''
</P>
<P>
   And now she's itching for a little more. Anderson has made
several other movies _ ``The Mighty,'' ``Chicago Cab'' _ that are
awaiting release and is currently filming the relationship drama
``Dancing About Architecture'' opposite such formidable co-stars as
Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Mighty,'' which is based on the popular kids' novel
``Freak the Mighty,'' her character is an alcoholic biker type. One
of those rebel outlets she mentioned?
</P>
<P>
   At least Gillian Anderson has some. Which brings us back to the
subject of Scully and whether the poor gal ever has any fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Scully happy?'' she ponders. ``I think she could be, and
she wants to be. She could probably allow herself to be happy, but
it would be very difficult for her to switch attention from her
work to her personal life _ and away from Mulder, too.

<P>
   ``But I think she's generally happy. Just because she doesn't
smile doesn't mean she's not happy.''

   &UR; EDITORS: In honor of Father's Day on June 21, The New York Times
Syndicate looks at the changing institution of fatherhood from many
perspectives. We examine the conflicts men face balancing work and
family, and the trend toward becoming fathers in middle age. We
offer two essays by dads anticipating Father's Day: one nostalgic
and one humorous. And for those dads who love to hit the links, Jim
McKay picks his ten top golfers.

 &UR; From Child magazine &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Much is written about the struggles of working women balancing
work and family. But what about the working dad? In the 1990s, more
and more fathers want to play a significant role in rearing their
children, but the workplace is not always so accommodating. Levine
and Pittinsky describe how a father's work affects his family and
vice versa, and offer suggestions on how to achieve a better
balance. (slugged:

   As many women have children later in life and divorced men
remarry and have second families, many men in theIR late 40s, 50s
and 60s are finding themselves the fathers of newborns. They may
get mistaken for grandfathers, but this new breed of fathers brings
a fresh new perspective to fatherhood, the authors say, often
valuing their children as much or even more than work. But older
fathers also face doubts about whether it's fair to raise a young
child at an advanced age. (slugged:

   This Father's Day, Herrera's children have asked him to take
them to see ``Godzilla.'' The request evokes memories of his own
childhood, when he and his dad would go to the movies on Father's
Day, a rare time for them to be together, just the two of them.
``The time a child spends alone with his or her father is special.
Too often it's taken for granted by both parent and child,''
Herrera says. (slugged:

   Lying in bed before dawn on Father's Day, Applegate dreams of
sneaking out for a quick round of golf. He alternates between
musings about life as a golf pro and counting the blessings in his
own life. Good sense prevails: ``There are those Sundays when
abandoning your family to play golf is maybe just a little sick.
Father's Day is one, Mother's Day definitely another.'' (slugged:

   &UR; By MARTIN CARNOY AND DAVID CARNOY &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (From ``Fathers of a Certain Age'') &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   It is Saturday morning, 6:30 a.m., and a faint light is
beginning to creep through the blinds of the master bedroom where
two figures are sleeping peacefully in their queen-sized bed.
Suddenly, they hear the creaking of a door hinge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the figures in the bed stirs, turning over onto his back.
This is Adam, who, somewhere in his confused semi-consciousness,
feels a weight on his body and then his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy,'' a tiny voice says next to his ear, ``it's time to get
up. It's light out.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam groans, his eyes still closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go back to sleep, honey,'' he manages to say. ``It's
nighttime.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, still without moving, not addressing anyone in particular:
``Can't you do something about this? I'm 54 years old and there's a
child sitting on my head at 6:30 in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam says that on mornings like these, he feels as if he's
living in a lost episode of ``The Twilight Zone.'' He is a member
of a fast-growing group of men who are fathering in their late 40s,
50s and even 60s. At a time when they should be basking in the
midafternoon sun of lives well lived, these men are raising young
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are mornings when I'll wake up _ I most likely, get
awakened,'' says Adam, ``and I'll say to myself, where the hell am
I? And who's this insane person in my body who's doing this? And
then I realize, it's me. I'm the insane person.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he's had his morning coffee, that attitude has begun
to improve. And by midafternoon _ the time he usually takes his son
to the park _ he feels quite good about himself and the decision
he's made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, but I don't see myself as any older than those
guys over there,'' he tells us, pointing to a couple of men in
their early 30s playing with their children nearby. ``Sure, at some
level I know I look like Alex's grandfather, and sometimes I catch
strange looks, but in my mind's eye, I'm no different than they are
_ just another father in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam is typical of these fathers ``of a certain age.'' They have
always been around, but now there seem to be a lot more of them.
They are the grayheads standing in line at the supermarket or the
folks you mistake for grandparents at the local nursery school.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid increase of middle-aged fathers and the growing _ and,
many would say, inappropriate _ interest in fathering relatively
late in a man's life are mainly the result of delayed childbearing
by many professional women and the rise in the divorce rate. And
technology has made it much more possible today for older women _
and their older husbands _ to have children even if the wife is not
significantly younger than the husband.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like fun _ older men finding new meaning in life
and women attaining professional success first and then having
families, too.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that it is such a good thing. Those who
object see older parents as acting selfishly, against the interest
of the children they choose to parent. They do not find the
grayheads with preschoolers cute. For many Americans, middle-aged
parents are just one more symbol of the decay of traditional values
and the growing selfishness that puts misplaced self-satisfaction
ahead of the greater social good.
 &UR; THE GREAT MORAL DEBATE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter is an everyday miracle,'' a friend in his 50s
tells us, smiling. Steve has three grown children, all boys, from
his first marriage, and a girl, age 2, from his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take the incredible gift of a child for granted when
you are in late middle age,'' Steve goes on. ``The unfolding of
life has to be savored _ observed carefully, contemplated and
understood _ when your own mortality confronts you daily in the
unforgiving reality of the early morning mirror. My attachment to
my daughter also has an immediacy and unconditionality that seems
more like what mothers are supposed to feel. I have discovered real
parenting skills, the ones I was too busy to work on when I was
climbing the so-called ladder of economic and social success.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and others who are fathering second families tend to talk
a lot about the difference in feelings and commitment they have
this second time around. Fathers in their late 40s, 50s and beyond
tend to value children as much as their work, and often more. They
seem to spend more time with their children than younger fathers.
Some have retired from the working world completely and take on
roles as stay-at-home parents while their younger wives go to
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the intensity of later fatherhood, the new role is
not easy. The self-indulgence of late middle age bumps against the
energies of a new life demanding attention. Even if an older father
may not be as concerned with competing at work, and much more
concerned with discovering his emotions, he often wants to focus on
himself, his wife, his children from an earlier marriage or his
grandchildren _ all of which can be tough competition against the
needs of his still-young child.
</P>
<P>
   One older father, Larry, was talking to the wife of an old
friend when the conversation turned abruptly to older parents. The
woman was obviously disturbed by the notion that Larry and other
men her husband's age are fathering young children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine Alan (her son) today, at 27,'' she said, quite
agitated, ``if he had been born to a father in his 50s. Suppose his
father had even lived that long, he would be 80. Could a man 80
years old provide the emotional support that a typical kid like
Alan still needs in his 20s? Could that same father at 70 have had
any meaningful connection with a teenager?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt it,'' she said. ``More likely, Alan would now have to
be taking care of an old man with serious health problems. I don't
think kids in their 20s are ready to do that. They should not have
to do it. They should be free to think about themselves. God knows,
the ego trip ends soon enough, why make them take on the worry of
aging parents when they should be exploring life?
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what it is to lose a parent when you are
young,'' she continued, getting angrier. ``I lost my mother when I
was 21, and I never got over it. It is devastating and unfair.
Sure, it happens even when you are born to young parents like I
was. But fathers who start in their 50s stand a good chance of
dying before their kids are 20. You may not like that idea, but it
is true. It leaves a tremendous void.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry says the conversation shook him to the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was I irresponsible in having a child so late in life?'' he
worries. ``Do children who have older parents and lose them
prematurely suffer a harm that makes the whole enterprise pure
self-gratification? I realized that in the decision around this
child, neither my wife or I had given much thought to whether I
would be alive at 75 or what I would be like in my 60s as our then
teenager confronted puberty and high school. Our main concerns had
been around our own lifestyle and how it would have to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he thought about it further, Larry realized that having a
father at age 50 or even 35 as a normal turn of events is a recent
phenomenon. His own father was 33 when Larry's grandfather died a
``normal'' death at 62, and this grandfather was 34 when his father
died in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   Today, if a man reaches 50, he will, on average, live past 80.
True, there is still a good chance that, if he is an older father,
his child will lose him in his or her 20s, at a time when many
children are still emotionally and financially dependent on their
fathers. But there is an even better chance that the father will be
there for the child's wedding and the grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Larry also contemplated the quality of the relationship with his
young child. Older parents know that they risk making their
children face a father's ``early'' death. Yet they also know that
they can give their child a higher material standard of living,
more father time, perhaps a higher quality of the father's time and
probably a more stable marital relationship during the years the
father is present.
</P>
<P>
   When we ask Larry about this conundrum, he is still not sure
what the right answer is. But he does feel that he has probably
spent a lot more time thinking about parenting than younger parents
do _ certainly more than when he had fathered his first child at
the age of 27.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Larry seems to have settled, at least in his own mind,
that he is doing the right thing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Before I leave work, I call my wife to ask what our 5-year-old
son, Will, has been up to,'' says Michael Johnson, a general
manager at a printing company in Portland, Maine. ``Then when I
come home, I can tap right into Will's world. I'll say, `I hear you
were running around with an eye patch playing pirate today.' It
lets him know I have been thinking of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Johnson, more fathers today are making a connection between
their work life and their family life. Nearly 70 percent of working
men say that family is just as important as their job, or more
important, according to a national Roper Organization survey. As a
result, many working dads are struggling to find the balance that
was once thought to be only a mother's problem.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 46 percent of fathers today say they don't spend enough
``quality time'' with their children. And when they're unable to do
this, 78 percent of men say they feel guilty, according to a survey
of nearly 350 parents conducted at Ohio's University of Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   So in these times, it's no longer enough to simply ask whether a
working mother hurts her kids by being away from them most of the
day. We now also need to address the brand-new question: What are
the consequences for families _ and businesses _ when fathers work?
</P>
<P>
   For years, it's been a fact of life that dads' jobs typically
take them away from their children for more than eight hours a day.
It's been through their work, through being good economic
providers, that fathers have established their very identities and
taken care of their families.
</P>
<P>
   So it never occurred to families or employers that business
should do anything _ aside from providing a paycheck _ to support
men as fathers. After all, why would it matter? Weren't work and
family separate worlds?
</P>
<P>
   The answer seems to be a resounding no. Over the past two
decades, a new wave of research on child and family development,
which had previously focused nearly exclusively on mothers, has
begun to document the vital role that fathers play in their
children's lives. This has led to a revolutionary understanding of
working dads: A man's dual roles as father and worker have an
enormous impact on each other.
 &UR; HOW WORK AFFECTS FAMILY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are the unseen stakeholders in the American workplace,''
says Stewart Friedman, director of the Wharton Life Interests
Project at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
``Fathers' work is an unseen and underappreciated influence on
children's development.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are some surprising ways that a father's work has impact,
positive or negative, on his kids.
</P>
<P>
   + When fathers are satisfied with their jobs, their children
have fewer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman and Jeffrey Greenhaus, professor of management at
Drexel University in Philadelphia, found that children ages 4 to 17
whose fathers say they are satisfied with their work exhibit fewer
behavioral problems such as shyness, withdrawal and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a dad is able to sit at the dinner table and talk about
his work with a positive attitude, confidence and pride, that seems
to rub off on his kids,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   + Too many or too few work hours affect children's learning and
development.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of 3-to-6-year-old children undertaken at Ohio State
University in Columbus, sociologists Toby Parcel and Elizabeth
Menaghan, the authors of ``Parents' Jobs and Children's Lives''
(Aldine De Gruyter, 1994), found that a father's unemployment may
be linked to increased behavior problems such as whining, hitting
and acting out. Conversely, working sustained overtime _ not just
putting in occasional long hours _ may also have a negative effect
on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, vocabulary will not be as developed,'' Parcel observes.
</P>
<P>
   When Dad is around, on the other hand, there are big benefits
for kids, numerous studies show. For example, at 6 months of age,
babies with actively involved fathers score higher on an
intellectual ability test, according to a study by F.A. Pederson,
author of the ``The Father-Infant Relationship'' (Praeger, 1980).
</P>
<P>
   And for girls, feeling competent in math is linked to a close
and warm relationship with their fathers, according to studies at
the University of Michigan School of Social Work in Ann Arbor.
</P>
<P>
   + How a boss treats a father can affect how a father treats his
kids.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis-based art director Jeff Lovell, who has custody of
his three children, often has to come in late to work for family
reasons. Fortunately, he has a supportive boss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not be able to stay with the company,'' Lovell says,
``if they didn't trust that I'll always get the work done.''
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of autonomy on the job leads to higher self-esteem
for a dad, according to researcher Karen Grimm-Thomas of
Pennsylvania State University in University Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's likely that when parents see themselves succeed at work,
they feel more confident as parents,'' she says. ``And they are
clearer about what they expect from their children, too.''
 &UR; HOW FAMILY AFFECTS WORK &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Do businesses value a man for being a good dad _ and show it in
their policies?
</P>
<P>
   Not as often as dads would like. Flextime is rarely an option.
Paternity leave is rarely paid. And since men typically continue to
earn more than women, it is usually not financially feasible for a
father to take an unpaid leave even if a company offers it.
</P>
<P>
   But good managers are at least beginning to recognize the
interdependence of work and family.
</P>
<P>
   At Corning Inc. in Corning, N.Y., manager Ed O'Brien lets his
employees define their own schedules. And he values the expertise
good parents bring with them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empathy, listening skills, knowing how to teach others and how
learning takes place _ all of these child-rearing practices are
directly applicable to the workplace,'' O'Brien says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a father who just returned to his job as a purchasing
agent after taking paternity leave says that caring for his
4-month-old has given him a whole new way of listening to people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look more closely for nonverbal signals now,'' he says,
``and I can use this skill when I'm talking with colleagues and
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company is sensitive to a father's family
responsibilities, dads want to keep working there. Mike Dedek, a
software engineer and father of three who works at Lexis-Nexis in
Miamisburg, Ohio, says, ``My dedication to this company is
primarily due to their family friendliness.''
</P>
<P>
   When a company's policies and programs take family needs into
account, employees are 45 percent more likely to ``go the extra
mile'' for their employer, say researchers at Dupont in Wilmington,
Del.
</P>

   Not only do these kinds of programs increase worker dedication,
but, as consultant Richard Federico of William Mercer Inc. in New
York observes, ``When people are less stressed out, they tend to
produce better on the job.''
 &UR; ACHIEVING A BETTER BALANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How can you ease your own work-and-family juggling act,
especially when you may not have the most enlightened of bosses?
Here are some strategies.
</P>
<P>
   + Ask, don't assume.
</P>
<P>
   Think your bosses will never allow any adjustment in work
schedule, or that they'd interpret a family obligation as a lack of
commitment to the job? If so, you might actually cheat yourself of
what you need.
</P>
<P>
   One father was hesitant to ask his supervisor if he could stay
home with his son, who wasn't feeling well, so his wife took time
off from her own job. The next day his boss _ a working parent
herself _ happened to ask how things were going at home. When he
mentioned that his wife was at home with their sick child, the boss
said, ``Why don't you do your work at home if you need to?''
</P>
<P>
   The moral of the story: If you don't ask for what you need, you
won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   + Frame your request in terms of work.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss doesn't have to hear every detail of a family problem.
He or she just needs to be convinced that, in an emergency, you
have a plan for getting your work done, such as doing it at home or
having a colleague cover for you.
</P>
<P>
   + Use your human resources department.
</P>
<P>
   HR professionals today often receive special training in helping
employees negotiate sticky work/family issues. So, again, ask for
help.
</P>
<P>
   + Turn down extra work with business savvy.
</P>
<P>
   As downsizing leads to bigger workloads, it's increasingly
important to know how to turn down work that might compromise your
family's needs.
</P>
<P>
   One way is to present your boss with options for reprioritizing
your work: ``I'll be able to take on this assignment if I give up
some other stuff on my plate. Can we review my assignments and see
what I might delay doing, or perhaps delegate to someone else?''
</P>
<P>
   + Find strength in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having work/family problems, it's likely that your
fellow employees are, too. Chris Colbern, who supervises payroll
services at Cigna, a Philadelphia-based insurance company, gathered
a group of co-workers together to look at how other companies had
implemented flextime. The result: a new Cigna scheduling system
that virtually all employees prefer.
</P>
<P>
   It may not yet be the law of the land, but a member of the
nation's highest court is recognizing dads' family needs. In 1994,
shortly after her appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was asked why she agreed to a flexible schedule
for law clerk David Post, who was attending Georgetown University
at night. His wife, an economist, had a demanding job, so Post
needed to care for their children during part of each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my dream of the way the world should be,'' Ginsburg
said. ``I was so pleased to see that there are indeed men who are
doing a parent's work, who do not regard that as strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like David, I hope, will be role models for other men
who may be fearful they won't succeed in their profession if they
spend time caring for their children or are concerned they will be
thought of as less than a man if family is of prime importance.''

   These are the weddings you'll never read about in the
untarnished world of bridal magazines: weddings in which a jealous
ex-lover sets fire to the newlyweds' limousine, the bride's
embittered divorced parents ignite a brawl, the couple's dog
relieves himself accompanying them down the aisle, the bride is
mugged in the ladies' room ... Take a side-splitting walk on the
dark side of matrimony with Debbi J. Karpowicz. (slugged:

</P>

   Woodham, society columnist for the Atlanta Journal and

of wedding etiquette. Can the bride walk down the aisle alone? Can
her mother be matron of honor? Can the bride ask a guy to be one of
her attendants? With humor and commonsense, Woodham tackles these
and other thorny questions head-on. (slugged:

   ``The line between amicability and all-out war can be thin where

to minimize conflict, especially on potentially explosive issues

   Newlyweds may discover that the person whom they love has
domestic habits that they hate. What if the bride is a neatnik and
the groom is a slob? What if he can't bear to talk to anyone when
he first wakes up and she is all bubbly? Even bathroom habits, such
as how one squeezes the toothpaste tube and whether to leave the
toilet seat up or down, can cause domestic turmoil. DeMorier offers
ideas on how to keep the home from turning into a battleground.

 &HT;    
 By JOE APPLEGATE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It is 5 a.m. on Father's Day, and you have decisions to make. Do
you lie quietly and wait for your children to come tumbling in with
their annual offerings of gratitude and affection, their homemade
cards, fund-raiser tie clips and bad cologne?
 &HT;    Or do you sneak out for a quick nine holes before anyone's the
wiser?
 &HT;    You turn and in the dimness can just make out the sleeping face
of your wife. You ask yourself where in the world you would be
without her.
 &HT;    Myrtle Beach?
 &HT;    Naah! This is where you belong, you tell yourself angrily. You
dope! A wife and children, good health, a steady job _ be honest
with yourself, you sorry hacker, would you trade them for anything
on this planet? Would you?
 &HT;    You choke back a tear.
 &HT;    Yes! Tiger Woods' swing.
 &HT;    Again, wearily, you try to imagine playing golf for a living,
having a job where you don't have to answer a phone, phone in an
answer, estimate budget figures, figure budget estimates or budget
estimated figures while answering the phone.
 &HT;    You are not so naive as to think that professional golfers don't
hate their jobs sometimes. And yet, try as you might, you cannot
imagine Woods telling himself that if he can just finish the back
nine by 5 o'clock he might be able to wedge in a quick staff
meeting before dinner.
 &HT;    OK, dude, you tell yourself, that's enough for one morning, get
a grip. Back to reality _ and a good, sane reality it is. You've
got some blessings to count:
 &HT;    + A wife who accepts your form of folly and who gets her
exercise hauling heavy packages around shopping malls. You both
carry your own bags.
 &HT;    + Kids who can be induced to come and play golf with you _ even
if it is for a price. You control the bets, however, and every
penny you have to pay out is worth it. The expression on a kid's
little face when a 20-foot putt is worth 20 bucks is priceless.
 &HT;    + Your own good sense, when all is said and done, in knowing
when to go for the greens and when to lay back, as now, in bed.
 &HT;    There are those Sundays when a full round of golf is a natural,
healthy choice. Is there any better alternative to the stupor of
the Super Bowl than a bracing round of golf on a deserted course,
even a snowy one?
 &HT;    And then there are those Sundays when abandoning your family to
play golf is maybe just a little bit sick. Father's Day is one,
Mother's Day definitely another.
 &HT;    So today, of all days, it's best to be still and enjoy your
status as father. Maybe one day your kid, interviewed after winning
a tournament and a big check on Father's Day, will smile at the
camera, wave and shout, ``I love you, Dad!'' _ just the way Woods
did on Mother's Day, except, of course, that he said, ``I love you,
Mom!''
 &HT;    And just think how popping proud you'll be that Father's Day,
watching it all on your VCR after coming in from your
late-afternoon round.

 By TIM HERRERA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Thanks to past Father's Days, I can go a month without washing
underwear and my necktie collection rivals the discount racks at
any department store. As the father of four children, I own
countless mugs, T-shirts and finger-paint artwork that read
``WORLD'S GREATEST DAD!''
 &HT;    I treasure every handcrafted present my three boys and one
daughter have ever made, because they made them for me. However, my
hopes may be too high for 1998.
 &HT;    ``What do you want for Father's Day this year?'' my boys asked.
 &HT;    Despite the countless strips of colored cloth that seem to mate
in my closet, I could always use another necktie. Coffee-shop
coupons beat scraping pennies off my dresser for a morning cup.
 &HT;    But this year, I want something radical: I want peace on
Father's Day.
 &HT;    I'm not talking about world peace _ although that would be nice,
too. I want tranquility within the four walls of our two-story
house.
 &HT;    I answered, ``What if you guys quit fighting on Father's Day?''
 &HT;    You see, a day rarely goes by in our house without ``He hit
me!'' followed by ``He hit me first!'' Then comes the witty
``Did-not-did-too!'' exchange.
 &HT;    I'm asking for a one-day truce, one that even NATO diplomats
would have trouble arranging. The treaty doesn't have to be in
writing _ I'll accept a verbal agreement, with or without
handshakes.
 &HT;    But I want an entire day without hearing ``Dork!'' ``Dog
breath!'' or something worse echoing through our house as the kids
battle for the Nintendo, the VCR or the remote control _ my remote
control.
 &HT;    My request puzzled them. Either they didn't understand or they
knew the mission was impossible. I could tell they were hunting for
an escape clause in an agreement they were reluctant to make.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, no fighting's good, Dad,'' they said. ``But how 'bout if
we go to the movies like we did last year? Maybe we can go see
`Godzilla?'''
 &HT;    ``What the heck,'' I said. ``Who needs peace and tranquility,
anyway?''
 &HT;    It seems we are forming a Father's Day tradition. Last year, we
also commemorated the day by watching loud, frightening and scaly
creatures engaging in noisy rampages. No, we weren't watching ``The
Jerry Springer Show'' or anything on C-Span _ we went to see ``The
Lost World.''
 &HT;    It was a memorable day, but not because of the film. It was
memorable because the outing was their idea.
 &HT;    I ended up taking our two older boys _ ages 8 and 10 _ to the
``Jurassic Park'' sequel. I felt the younger kids were too little
to watch dinosaurs devour screaming humans, even at matinee prices.
 &HT;    While driving to the theater with the boys, I started thinking
about my father and the only time I could ever remember just the
two of us going to the movies.
 &HT;    It was a cool, spring Pennsylvania day. Dad and I carried light
jackets as we walked to the old Memorial Theater, strolling along
the steep hills, past the Veterans Memorial and my school, St.
Joseph's Elementary.
 &HT;    Dad was barely 5-foot-4, but I was still much smaller and
struggled to keep up with his quick stride.
 &HT;    Sometimes I get angry because I can't recall everything about
that day. However, I am grateful for one image still floating in my
mind: I remember looking over, seeing the light from the movie
screen flickering on Dad's face and thinking how cool it was that
he was just spending time with me.
 &HT;    All the way home from the theater, I replayed the film for my
father. Since Dad laughed, I was positive he liked the Batman movie
as much as I did. But I never really found out _ I never thought to
ask.
 &HT;    Dad died about five years ago, and every third Sunday in June I
think of our day at the movies.
 &HT;    As my sons and I walked out of the theater after ``The Lost
World,'' our eyes adjusting to the sunlight glaring off the parking
lot, my middle son turned and asked: ``Dad, did you like the
movie?''
 &HT;    ``I sure did, pal.''
 &HT;    He'll never know how glad I am that he asked.
 &HT;    When we're coming out of the theater this year, maybe I'll catch
them in a weak moment and ask them to pick up the smelly sweat
socks they've scattered from the corner of the kitchen to the edge
of the driveway.
 &HT;    While we're at it, let's have an armpit-noise ceasefire _
especially at the dinner table and at church.
 &HT;    But perhaps I should just appreciate the time with them. The
time a child spends alone with his or her father is special. Too
often it's taken for granted by both parent and child.
 &HT;    Maybe peace at home on Father's Day is a bit much to ask. Maybe
all we need is another nice monster movie and some time together to
create some moments worth reliving.

 &UR; By JIM MCKAY &QL; 
 &UR; (Excerpted from ``The Real McKay: My Wide World of Sports'') &QL; 
(Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than 40 years, I have walked the fairways of the world
behind the game's greatest artists, playing in the most famous
championships on the planet's most storied courses.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, golf has exploded, both as a spectator and a
participant sport. Why?
</P>
<P>
   To me, it has principally been the result of the sterling
careers of certain players, and not Arnold Palmer alone. I'll be
audacious enough now to list my top 10 players, whose achievements
I have described on ABC and CBS during the past 40 years.
 &UR; The McKay Ratings &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Jack Nicklaus
</P>
<P>
   Twenty majors in all. Will anyone ever equal that?
</P>
<P>
   Tack on a total of 70 wins on the PGA Tour, two Walker Cup
teams, six Ryder Cup teams (twice captain), two U.S. Senior Open
titles and a Senior PGA. He intimidated his peers like no one since
Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was not, however, without his crushing defeats or his
personal insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   His toughest loss came at Pebble Beach in the 1982 U.S. Open. At
the age of 42, he had finished his final round of the championship
and was standing beside the scorer's tent waiting to be interviewed
as the first player ever to win five U.S. Opens, if Tom Watson
bogied either of the last two holes. And Watson was in trouble, his
ball sitting in long grass behind the green of the par three 17th.
</P>
<P>
   From our tower at 18, I looked down on Nicklaus. He was staring
at a monitor showing Watson lining up his shot. From the difficult
lie, it might well run far across the green, leaving him a likely
bogie and setting up victory for Jack.
</P>
<P>
   But Watson made ``the shot heard round the world,'' knocking the
ball into the hole for a birdie. In that instant, as he stood just
below me, Jack's expression was not his usual ironic half-smile of
defeat, but a look of total shock and deep disappointment, the face
of a stricken youngster, not of the most famous golfer in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   2. Arnold Palmer
</P>
<P>
   To understand Arnold Palmer and his endless appeal to Everyman,
it helps to sit with him as I did at the home (in Latrobe, Pa.) he
and his wife, Winnie, have lived in for more than 35 years and
understand that he IS Everyman.
</P>
<P>
   He still loves to sit by the pool, looking down toward the
course he grew up on, just at the bottom of the hill. That day some
four or five years ago, he smiled and told me how he used to lie
outside his family's house on the edge of the course and wait for
the woman to come by the sixth hole--the woman who always gave him
a nickel if he would hit her ball over the water hazard for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see myself now when I was really small,'' he said.
``Making sure my dad couldn't see me because I wasn't allowed on
the course.''
</P>
<P>
   I once asked Arnold Palmer how he has kept such a hold on his
fans. He looked at me, a faint smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim,'' he said, ``maybe it's because they understand who I am.
I think I am an honestly sensitive and sentimental person. Maybe
they sense that I care a great deal about what I do and that their
encouragement means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Lee Trevino
</P>
<P>
   My most vivid memory of Trevino in his heyday is at the 1972
British Open on the Muirfield links in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been the pro-am preceding the Quad Cities Open as
far as his attitude was concerned. He kept up a running
conversation, or more properly a monologue, with the Scottish
gallery all the way around.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on one tee, he turned to the crowd and said, ``They
took me to an old castle for dinner last night. We had food like
they ate back in the old days, and we ate like they did--with our
fingers. Heck, back home in Texas I even have a cat I taught to eat
with a fork!''
</P>
<P>
   Then he laughed and knocked his tee shot in his usual
left-to-right arc into the middle of the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   4. Tom Watson
</P>
<P>
   Of his remarkable five British Open victories, four of them were
won by a single shot, one in a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   If Nicklaus was the greatest and Palmer the most charismatic of
championship golfers, certainly Tom Watson, as he plays on in his
late 40s, still convinced that he will win another major, is the
most tenacious.
</P>
<P>
   5. Gary Player
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1954, at the age of 18, Gary Player stepped off a
train at a small town in Scotland, carrying a cardboard suitcase
held together with a piece of rope. Since that day, he has become
the world's most traveled athlete, flying around the globe year
after year, winning the national championships of the United
States, Great Britain, Australia, Chile, and Brazil, among others.
</P>
<P>
   His dedication to fitness and proper diet borders on the
fanatical, and some of his beliefs approach the mystical. In the
earlier days, he would usually dress totally in black. ``Why?'' he
was asked. ``It must be terribly hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he replied, ``but it makes me feel strong.''
</P>
<P>
   6. Greg Norman
</P>
<P>
   I feel uncomfortable not placing Greg Norman in my top bracket.
Today, he is probably the best-known golfer in the world, having
won 55 tournaments internationally, as well as 16 on the American
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But...
</P>
<P>
   Every great player has performances he would rather forget, but
Greg's have come in the spotlight of major championships and have
come in such dramatic fashion that they dominate his image, despite
all his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   7. Seve Ballesteros
</P>
<P>
   His emergence was sudden, his impact enormous, his downfall
unforeseen and shocking.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? No one knows, although some theorists blame
imperfections in his swing, others the explosive nature of his
character. But it seems to be over for Seve at age 40, unless he
can pull some middle-aged miracles as he creeps toward 50 and the
Senior Tour. His impact on the game remains, however.
</P>
<P>
   It was his play that forced expansion of the Ryder Cup matches
from the U.S. versus Great Britain and Ireland to the U.S. versus
all of Europe. As a result, the matches,have become an increasingly
competitive and major event.
</P>
<P>
   8. Nick Faldo
</P>
<P>
   He has not yet joined the pantheon of the game, partly because
of his rather phlegmatic personality and, in the minds of some
people, because of his reliance on a golfing guru named David
Leadbetter, who completely rebuilt Nick's swing and follows him
around the course and to the practice tee as if Faldo were still a
student, not a champion.
</P>
<P>
   At times, I have found myself thinking, Can you imagine Ben
Hogan being followed every step of his career by a coach?
</P>
<P>
   9. Ray Floyd
</P>
<P>
   How's this for career longevity? He was only 18 when he turned
pro 35 years ago. Now, as he nears his mid-50s, he is still winning
on the Senior Tour and occasionally returning to the regular tour
to instruct his juniors by example on how to play the game with
skill and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   10. To round out my top 10, I'll have to resort to that old cop-
out, a tie. In this case, a three way tie, among Ben Crenshaw, Tom
Kite and Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   Now what shall I do about Tiger Woods and Ernie Els?
</P>
<P>
   All three of the world's famous championships were won in '97 by
men in their 20s; Woods, 21, the Masters; Els, 27, the U.S. Open;
and Leonard, 25, the British Open. Might one of them be the new
Nicklaus or Palmer? Possibly.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as ranking any of them, I can only echo the comment
made long ago by Red Smith. After Willie Mays had turned in his
second great season in the majors, someone asked Red if he thought
Mays was as good as Joe DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come back and ask me that in 20 years,'' he said, ``and I'll
tell you.''

 BOSTON: ... of careers.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The hostility toward Deborah Eappen surprised Caryl Rivers, a
Boston University professor and author of a new book on two-career
families. It seemed to suggest that, counter to some of Rivers'
research, society wasn't so comfortable with working mothers after
all.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivers points out that the backlash against Deborah Eappen
``was about more than working parents. It was class, it was who
pays for what, it was how much childcare should cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame fell on Deborah Eappen not simply for being at work when
her baby had to be rushed to the hospital but for allegedly
exploiting Woodward, who was paid $115 to work 45 hours per week,
even though the Eappens had the added expense of Woodward's travel
and agency fees.
</P>
<P>
   When, at trial, Woodward's legal team got a neurosurgeon to
admit that serum leaked from eight-month old Matthew Eappen's wound
_ a sign that the injury might have occurred long before he lapsed
into a coma _ many of Woodward's defenders blamed the Eappens for
accusing a working-class girl from economically faltering Elton,
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``One Less Baby, One More Volvo,'' read a sign thrust outside
the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the offices and living rooms of Massachusetts, some people
took sides on the merits of the case, with their sentiments falling
along class lines. Cocktail parties hummed with disgust over the
way Woodward's defenders were casting blame on a working mother.
Bars thundered with anger over Reilly's hubris in charging the girl
with anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   In England, where Woodward's neighbors posed for TV cameras
while following her trial in a pub in Elton, commentators wondered
aloud if Woodward were being mistreated because she was a foreigner
_ an English girl in ``Irish'' Boston. British newspapers routinely
referred to ``the Irish American prosecutor, Mr. Tom Reilly.''
</P>
<P>
   When Woodward, looking every inch the apple-cheeked schoolgirl,
took the stand to deny hurting Matthew Eappen, she won over her
countrymen. But many wondered: Would her stiff upper lip, which
impressed folks back home as a show of fortitude, come off as cold
to a jury in the more emotive US?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Any notion that Woodward lacked emotions evaporated the night
before Halloween, when she screamed and nearly collapsed after the
jury, revealing its decision in mid-evening, declared her guilty of
murder in the second degree.
</P>
<P>
   National TV networks interrupted their sitcoms and dramas for
the live ``feed'' from Cambridge. Within minutes, the country's
airwaves were congested with familiar celebrity-lawyers from
Simpson days: Alan Dershowitz, Johnnie Cochran Jr., Leslie
Abramson, Greta Van Susteren. And what had been largely a cultural
debate about childcare became another troubling referendum on the
efficacy of the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   One figure from the Simpson era didn't have to be &UR;  &LR; tracked down:
Barry Scheck, the forensic-evidence specialist with the distinctive
hectoring style, sat beside Woodward on the defense bench. He had
been part of Woodward's four-member defense team, assigned to
discredit the medical evidence pointing to ``shaken-baby syndrome''
as the cause of Matthew's death.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believed Scheck had done a pretty good job
raising questions about whether the baby had died of a fresh
injury, as prosecutors insisted. The prosecution was hardly
confident of a murder conviction. Reilly's assistants offered to
give the jury the option of finding Woodward guilty of
manslaughter. The defense, sensing an acquittal, refused.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fateful decision.
</P>
<P>
   After the jury convicted Woodward of second-degree murder, with
a minimum sentence of 15 years in prison, Scheck, Silverglate and
fellow defender Andrew Good met the media with the washed-out,
almost tearful faces of a baseball team having just lost the World
Series. They accepted responsibility for the failure to allow the
jury to consider manslaughter, and insisted that Woodward should
not be made to pay for their error.
</P>
<P>
   Silverglate, for one, believed the jury acted out a ``post-O.J.
backlash'' against cases in which the defense seeks to raise
``reasonable doubts.'' And, he says, Scheck ``reminded people more
viscerally'' of the earlier trial.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Judge Hiller B. Zobel, the veteran jurist known for his
willingness to go against convention. Eleven days after the jury
announced its decision, Zobel exercised a seldom-invoked judicial
prerogative to reduce Woodward's conviction to manslaughter, and to
limit her sentence to time served.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Did the widespread media coverage of public sympathy for
Woodward embolden Zobel to take such an unusual step? If so, that
by itself suggests that television is influencing the rendering of
justice.
</P>
<P>
   But the larger question remains whether society was well served
by the amount of attention given the case.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of better training for those who care for children,
yes. Philip Johnson, president of EF Au Pair, says the case
transformed his business, which oversees 4,000 foreigners working
in American homes. Standards are tougher: All au pairs now undergo
personality tests, and must document 200 hours of infant care.
Training now includes eight hours of instruction in coping with
children under age 2. The Massachusetts Legislature is considering
a bill to raise the weekly stipend for au pairs to $187. Still, the
number of British girls seeking placements plunged by about a half.
</P>
<P>
   By now, however, British anger over Woodward's treatment has
receded. Many still consider her a martyr, but many others have
come to decry the jingoistic response of what a columnist for The
Times of London called ``the crisps-munching pub crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some indication that, after viewers digest an
especially filling case, reason supersedes emotion. In
Massachusetts, Woodward served as one bookend to another hugely
publicized case, the murder of Jeffrey Curley, the Cambridge boy
lured by his killers with the promise of a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   If the Curley case persuaded some skeptics that there are, in
fact, crimes so heinous as to justify the death penalty, the
Woodward trial, which knocked Curley off the front page, argued in
return that life-and-death decisions ought not be entrusted to the
legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The last word on the Woodward case, some people believe, should
be ``if'': If only the prosecutor had charged her with a lesser
offense. If only the defense had allowed the jury to consider
manslaughter. If only the judge had let the jury's verdict stand
... Too many ifs for most tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This system is flawed, but that doesn't mean it's bad,'' said
Joshua Rubenstein, the northeast regional director of Amnesty
International. ``It's a human system. Just like everything else in
society.''

 By DEBBI J. KARPOWICZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Cakes topple. Drunken relatives fight. Brides turn out to be
allergic to their flowers. Gowns and tuxes don't arrive in time.
 &HT;    These are some of the mishaps that can beset a wedding, no
matter how carefully it is planned. Even wedding coordinators admit
that some things are beyond their control.
 &HT;    For example, Phyllis Block, head of the wedding team at The
World Trade Center in Boston, once handled a wedding at which the
couple's dog walked down the aisle _ and relieved himself.
 &HT;    Toni deLisi, a consultant in Waldwick, N.J., once planned a
wedding at The Plaza Hotel in New York, only to have thieves steal
the flowers from the delivery truck parked on Fifth Avenue.
 &HT;    Then there are times when things go really awry: Guests have
fistfights and get arrested. An ex-girlfriend sets the limo on
fire.
 &HT;    If anyone has seen couples get hitched _ with about every hitch
possible _ it's the Rev. Dennis James Robinson, a justice of the
peace and Unitarian minister based in Hopkinton, Mass.
 &HT;    Robinson, who performed 327 weddings in 1997, once married a
couple in a Jacuzzi filled with orange Jell-O. It involved 72
packets of gelatin, 268 gallons of water and a canoe-paddle
stirrer.
 &HT;    At one wedding over which Robinson presided, the bride's
divorced parents were on bad terms. After the groom's father gave
an emotional toast to the newlyweds, the bride's embittered father
grabbed the microphone and launched into a tirade.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to let you all know that my ex-wife is a no-good
 !!% !%!,'' he ranted. Everyone gasped, as he continued, ``I also
wanted you all to know that I contributed to this wedding.''
 &HT;    He was interrupted by his ex-wife, who shot back, ``No, you
didn't, you  !!%!'' The ex-wife then jumped up, grabbed her
ex-husband's throat and punched him in the stomach.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the ex-husband's new girlfriend clawed at the ex-wife
with her fingernails, while both reached for the microphone to use
as a weapon.
 &HT;    The fight eventually spilled out into the parking lot. When all
was said and done, 11 people were arrested.
 &HT;    Another time, Robinson officiated at a ceremony on a patio
overlooking a golf course. During the nuptials, he realized there
was a ruckus behind him, but he didn't dare turn around. When it
came time for the bride to say her vows, a breathy voice in back of
him yelled, ``I do.''
 &HT;    It was the groom's ex-girlfriend, decked out in a wedding gown,
determined to get revenge. Pandemonium broke out faster than you
can say ``Fatal Attraction.'' The groom then warned everyone to be
careful, as his former flame had recently broken into his house,
trashed it and slit his car tires.
 &HT;    When the chauffeur left the limousine for a moment, the angry ex
took lighter fluid, wrote ``I Love You'' on the hood of the car and
set it on fire.
 &HT;    ``I left before I heard what happened next,'' Robinson says.
 &HT;    Another memorable affair was an Irish wedding at which the
budget-conscious couple relied on a relative and a boom box instead
of hiring professional musicians. Unfortunately, Uncle Joe got
inebriated and played tunes that were inappropriate, to say the
least. The parents danced to ``Send in the Clowns,'' the newlyweds
waltzed to ``The Stripper'' and the groom and his mother danced to
``Do It to Me One More Time.''
 &HT;    Doug Giordano, director of food and beverage at New Jersey's
Woodcliff Lake Hilton, once had a bride who was assaulted by
strangers in the restroom.
 &HT;    This happened at another hotel, where the ballroom and the bar
shared a restroom. Apparently, three jealous _ and intoxicated _
female customers came upon the happy bride in the bathroom, held
her against the wall and burned holes into her gown with their
cigarettes.
 &HT;    At another wedding that Giordano handled, three rap stars, who
had just performed at The Meadowlands, returned to their hotel and,
out of boredom, crashed the wedding in the ballroom. They ran out
onto the dance floor and started to sing and dance, Giordano
recalls. When one of the bridesmaids confronted them, it evolved
into a fistfight ``with split lips, black eyes and five police
cars,'' he says.
 &HT;    At least there were no threats of bullets. Teddy Lenderman, a
wedding coordinator in Terre Haute, Ind., wore a bulletproof vest
for one of the weddings she worked on _ as did the priest, groom
and several members of the wedding party.
 &HT;    Apparently, the groom's irrational mother didn't like the bride,
and told him, ``If you marry her, I'm going to come in and blow you
all away.''
 &HT;    No one took Mom seriously _ until she showed up at a relative's
funeral, where she slapped the corpse and slammed the casket shut.
When the funeral director approached her, she kicked him and broke
his leg in three places.
 &HT;    On the day before the wedding, she called the rectory five times
and threatened the clergyman with bodily harm.
 &HT;    On the wedding day, the nervous groom called his mom and forbade
her to come.
 &HT;    ``She didn't show,'' Lenderman says. ``But in my 14 years of
business, at that point, I had never experienced anything so
nerve-wracking.''
 &HT;    The bride was the tremulous one at a wedding attended by Barbara
Sheehan, an executive at The Royal Hawaiian in Hawaii.
 &HT;    Sheehan recalls that the bride got halfway down the aisle, then
turned around to ask one of her bridesmaids a question:
 &HT;    ``You can learn to love someone, can't you?''

 &UR; By MARTHA A. WOODHAM &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; From ``The Bride Did What?!''
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Brides and grooms get so much advice _ most of it wrong _ that
they panic. It's like having a baby: As soon as people find out
you're expecting a wedding, they feel free to tell you what to do
and give dire warnings about being improper _ i.e., tacky.
</P>
<P>
   Your mother is sure she knows what's correct. Your beloved's
mother has her own ideas, and your neighbor down the street can't
wait to tell you horror stories about the tacky weddings she's
attended. You begin to feel queasy at the thought of ``Your Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, worry no more. Here are the Top Ten Marriage Myths _ and
the right answers, no matter what anyone says. Folks will swear
these myths are the eternal Etiquette Truth etched in stone and
handed down by some Etiquette God. Well, they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   1. The bride and groom must ask their siblings to be bridesmaids
and groomsmen.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is customary to ask brothers and sisters to be
attendants, the bride and groom are free to ask whomever they wish
_ best friends, pals from the office, a buddy from a favorite bar.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: This could be deadly. Friends come and go, while
your families are there forever. You avoid a lot of hurt feelings
by asking brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Tacky brides wail, ``But I don't feel close to his sisters. I
want my friends instead.'' A wedding is a great place to get
acquainted. After the ``I do's,'' those strangers will be your
sisters, too.
</P>
<P>
   2. The bride must be escorted down the aisle and given away by
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Being given away is a tradition that evolved from the days when
men bought brides from their fathers or, even worse, captured them.
Today many young women feel this custom is archaic. Somehow it was
charming when a woman went from her father's home directly to her
new husband's, but that's not true of most couples today.
</P>
<P>
   With so many women going to college, supporting themselves and
marrying later, being ``given away'' seems terribly out-of-date.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't want it, leave it out of the ceremony. And if you
choose, walk down the aisle by yourself. Not every bride has a
father, nor does every bride like her father. Some brides say going
solo made them feel like royalty.
</P>
<P>
   3. The bride's father must sit in the first pew with the bride's
mother, even if they hate the sight of each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a perfect world, divorced mothers and fathers would overcome
their loathing so all could be sweetness and light on their child's
wedding day.
</P>
<P>
   Let's get real. Divorce is a 1990s fact of life. When divorced
parents get along, it's wonderful. Mom and Dad can sit together,
one big happy parental unit on the first pew.
</P>
<P>
   This changes if stepparents are in the picture. Mom _ and her
new husband _ should sit in the first pew. Dad _ and his new wife _
should sit in the next pew.
</P>
<P>
   If they do not get along, Dad and his new wife should sit even
farther back in the church _ far enough away to avoid bodily harm.
(All of this goes for the groom's parents, too.)
</P>
<P>
   4. The number of groomsmen must equal the number of bridesmaids.
</P>
<P>
   So who's counting? Unlike many other areas of modern life, there
is no rule that says a wedding party must have equality.
</P>
<P>
   An equal number of men and women makes a pretty picture at the
altar _ and makes life easier for the wedding consultant _ but this
is not mandatory. You can have all men, all women _ even all
children if you like.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be politically correct at your wedding.
</P>
<P>
   5. A bride cannot ask her mother to be the matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can be a best man, there is no reason a mother can't
be matron of honor. It's a beautiful, loving gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The only drawback is if the wedding is a very large one. The
mother of the bride and the matron of honor each may have so many
duties that it could be a burden to ask your mom to undertake both
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But if a bride's mom is extremely organized and is her best
friend, she should ask her.
</P>
<P>
   6. A bride cannot ask her mother to escort her down the aisle.
</P>
<P>
   If a father can escort his daughter, there is no reason a mother
can't. More and more brides are asking their moms to make the
stroll down the aisle instead of bench-warming the first pew. This
custom is borrowed from Jewish ceremonies, where both parents
escort the bride and groom.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lovely gesture, and most moms are thrilled to be asked.
</P>
<P>
   7. A flower girl must be under age 6.
</P>
<P>
   The littler they are, the cuter they are _ and the more they can
disrupt your ceremony! The same goes for ring bearers.
</P>
<P>
   Flower girls have refused to go down the aisle or toss their
petals. One little ring bearer grabbed the flower girl's basket,
dumped the petals in a pile and began jumping on it.
</P>
<P>
   And my mom loves to tell of when I was a flower girl: At a
crucial moment in the ceremony, I stage-whispered, ``Mommy, I have
to tee-tee.''
</P>
<P>
   The only criterion for the job of flower girl or ring bearer
should be how important a child is to you. If the little girl or
little boy is someone you want to include, by all means do it, no
matter how old _ or young _ the child is.
</P>
<P>
   8. Brides and grooms must pick attendants who are close to their
own age.
</P>
<P>
   No, the only requirement for being an attendant is a sincere
attachment to the bride or groom _ and the ability to pay for the
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I know of brides in their 20s who had bridesmaids in their 60s,
and the weddings were full of love and rejoicing.
</P>
<P>
   9. A pregnant woman cannot be a bridesmaid.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mystery to me why it is considered poor manners to have
a pregnant woman participate in a ceremony so full of fertility
symbols.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, bridesmaids were young women who surrounded the
bride to confuse any evil spirits lurking about. Perhaps a
bridesmaid had to be fleet-footed, and it's hard to run when you
are pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   I see no problems with asking a friend who is with child, other
than logistical ones: She may have trouble fitting into her dress,
and she may feel uncomfortable standing for long periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   10. There can be only one maid of honor and one matron of honor.
</P>
<P>
   A bride may have two of either if she wishes. And she doesn't
have to limit herself to women.
</P>
<P>
   If the bride's best friend is a guy, she should ask him. But she
shouldn't call him, as one Atlanta bride did, her ``mister of
honor.''

 c.1998 Elegant Wedding, published by Philadelphia magazine.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His parents: ``Your turkey is dry, you didn't take the family
name and you're five years older than him.''
</P>
<P>
   Your parents: ``He's not your religion, he's supporting an
ex-wife and child and you make more money than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And if either of your parents nudges you about wanting
grandchildren one more time ...
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the line between amicability and all-out war can be
thin where in-laws are concerned. With practice, though, experts
say, you can learn to get along ... and the sooner the better.
</P>
<P>
   Intruding in-laws are a mainstay on the marital trouble list,
says Marlene Watson, a couples-and-family therapist in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents never stop being protective or wanting the best for
their child,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, she explains, one partner may feel that an in-law is
interfering and his or her spouse is not doing anything about it.
Then, to make matters worse, the spouse feels he or she is being
attacked by the partner and pressured by one or both sets of
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Battle No. 1 is, `Where's your primary loyalty?''' says
Watson, who is also director of the couples-and-family therapy
graduate program at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia. ``Your primary allegiance needs to be with your
partner, but you can't exclude parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to riding out most in-law conflicts is to act as a
united couple, Watson says. Both partners need to set up boundaries
and communicate them to the in-laws. This could mean asking your
mother not to call before 9:30 a.m. on weekends or telling your
father-in-law that your financial affairs are a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   It's also important not to put down your spouse's parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the partner defensive and rally to the side of the
parent,'' Watson says. Instead, explain to your mate what the
problem is and involve him or her in suggesting ways to resolve the
conflict.
 &UR; COUPLES AT RISK: WHO ISN'T? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Few people sail into in-law relationships without some
apprehension and discomfort at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marriage is a transition for everyone,'' Watson says.
``You're bringing together two sets of rules, and each family feels
its rules should be followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet many of these differences are arbitrary and not really
important, says Michael Ascher, a psychologist and professor of
psychiatry at Temple University School of Medicine. For instance,
he says, while a new bride may disapprove of her in-laws'
predinner-cocktail ritual, she can learn to accept that it isn't
tantamount to alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Studies indicate that younger people have more problems relating
to their in-laws than those over 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents and in-laws play a more significant role with younger
people, for whom conflicts about independence and autonomy still
exist,'' Ascher notes.
</P>
<P>
   In-law tensions may erupt as soon as the couple announces the
engagement. Parents may feel abandoned and experience anxiety about
the impending separation. There may be discomfort about
acknowledging their child's sexuality. They may fear adverse
changes in the family structure. Or differences in the new
son-in-law or daughter-in-law may be perceived as a threat or
rejection of their own values.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Bilofsky, a Cherry Hill, N.J.-based psychotherapist and
co-author of ``Inlaws/Outlaws: How to Make Peace with His Family
and Yours'' (Villard Books, 1991), encourages newlyweds to reassure
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heavy doses of `I love you, I will always love you and I will
always be your child' go a long way toward easing a parent's
troubled heart,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly if the bride is older than her husband, his mother
may feel that her daughter-in-law is trying to usurp her role. Or a
new wife may become anxious that the undesirable qualities she
observes in her new father-in-law will be transferred to his son.
And don't overlook potential sibling-in-law problems, Watson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siblings can have as major an impact on the couple as
parents,'' she says. `` They may call to ask for money, become very
protective or take a strong dislike to the in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Before you meet your in-laws, have your fiance brief you about
their likes, dislikes and sensitivities. The added knowledge will
reduce the risk of your offending them and enable you to ask
questions that engage their interest.
 &UR; POTENTIAL SORE SPOTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + Wedding planning.
</P>
<P>
   If a couple pays for all the arrangements, they may have things
exactly as they wish, Watson says. If parents are financing the
affair, though, the couple should be prepared to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   + Juggling families.
</P>
<P>
   One newlywed says the biggest adjustment has been getting used
to the visitation demands of her husband's large, very close
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into this huge family who did everything together. My
family felt like I was always with my husband's family for
birthdays, Sunday dinners and holidays,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she says, she had to deal with ``the insanity of
having to be at both sets of parents' homes for every holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the couple announced they were alternating: They
would spend Thanksgiving and Christmas Day with her family, and
Christmas Eve and Easter with his folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fourth of July is up for grabs!'' she says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Another time when both had sisters celebrating birthdays on the
same day, the couple simply agreed to split up so each could attend
his or her own family's party.
</P>
<P>
   + Negotiating.
</P>
<P>
   The experts agree that it is wise to deal with your own parents
about sensitive issues such as financial requests or choosing baby
names, especially early in the marriage. Not only do you know your
parents' quirks, but any resulting anger and annoyance is more
likely to be forgiven and forgotten with you than with your spouse,
Ascher says.
</P>
<P>
   Once you know your in-laws better, try to handle disagreements
yourself without putting your spouse in the middle. Find a tactful
way to ask that your mother-in-law call before dropping in. Or
state firmly that family-planning decisions are between you and
your husband.
</P>
<P>
   + Money.
</P>
<P>
   Asking parents for money can set the stage for disputes about
how the gift is used and how you're living your life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't accept large gifts unless you're willing to accept the
negatives that may go with them,'' Ascher advises. ``If you accept
a house down payment, expect visits and interference. Decide if
it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   + Criticism.
</P>
<P>
   If one of your parents is making derogatory statements about
your spouse, your first priority is to your husband or wife. A
parent should be told that he or she doesn't have to love your
spouse, but must respect your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tolerate your spouse criticizing your parents, and don't
let your in-laws play you against your spouse.
</P>
<P>
   + Cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your family ignores your spouse in conversations and
activities, continue to include him or her in important events and
discussions. Maintain a separate relationship with your parents,
too, such as having lunch sometimes, Watson recommends.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may just have to give a parent time,'' she says. ``Stay in
there and have faith.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you plain don't like one of your in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   ``Your best bet is to be patient, cordial and mannerly,''
according to Bilofsky. ``You have a loved one in common. Do it for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, she adds, ``Remind yourself that your in-laws
must have done something right _ look at the child they raised.''

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT DeMORIER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``Crib Notes for the First Year of Marriage''  
 &HT;    Whether you've been living together since junior high school or
spent your first night together on your honeymoon, the agenda for
the first year of marriage is pretty much the same. Just when you
thought you knew your spouse better than your spouse knew himself
or herself, you're really meeting each other for the first time.
 &HT;    Many young couples tend to see married life as an extension of
single life, with an additional person. But as soon as two people
step across the marriage threshold, with sweater-drying rack and
dartboard in hand, two sets of histories and expectations must
join.
 &HT;    Studies of marriage show there is no correlation between an easy
first year of marriage and living together prior to being married,
but living together does get a few of those
put-the-old-milk-carton-in-front-of-the-new-one-so-we-use-the-
old-one-first type of rules out of the way. Some of them, but not
all.
 &HT;    Below are some of the most common issues in the first year of
marriage, and some suggestions for how couples can deal with them.
 &HT;    + Feeling at home.
 &HT;    Having a housewarming or a dinner party is a great way to make a
new home your own, whether you have moved in with your spouse or
the two of you have moved into a new home together. Having friends
and family there to see you in your new surroundings can create a
sense of pride in your home, and a feeling of ease and comfort.
 &HT;    Sometimes it's the little things that help establish roots, such
as being the voice on the answering machine, planting a garden or
making friends with the neighbors.
 &HT;    + The slob factor.
 &HT;    If your spouse's housekeeping skills leave a bit to be desired,
if clothes and dishes pave a path from the couch to the
refrigerator, the pile method is a great alternative to bashing
your spouse with a tire iron.
 &HT;    The pile method simply involves picking a neutral location _ a
desk, a dresser, a closet, somewhere you can live with a mess _ and
placing all the wallets, car keys, dirty socks, magazines, dishes
and so forth in that place.
 &HT;    This works for the ``neatnik,'' because everything can be picked
up and deposited quickly, and it works for the slob because
everything is in one place. Note: This is a treatment, not a cure.
 &HT;    + The clash of expectations.
 &HT;    Sit down and discuss in detail how you expect your life as a
couple to be. Maybe your mental picture is unrealistic. You won't
know until it's out in the open. Be specific.
 &HT;    Do you expect coffee to be brought to you in the morning like
your father did for your mother? Do you expect your mate to be home
exactly at 5 o'clock? Do you expect to be able to have friends over
every night?
 &HT;    The majority of newlyweds' fights occur when one spouse is not
acting the way the other spouse expects. But no one, not even
Robert Duvall, can act without a script.
 &HT;    + The age-old toothpaste dilemma.
 &HT;    This type of conflict is quite normal and really simple to
resolve when you get right down to it. If your mate insists on
leaving the cap off the toothpaste, or worse, squeezing the tube in
the middle (gasp!), just buy two tubes of toothpaste.
 &HT;    To solve the problem of whether to roll the toilet paper over or
under _ believe it or not, this actually accounted for an entire
segment on Oprah _ try installing two rollers.
 &HT;    Of course, having separate bathrooms would solve not only both
these problems but also that perennial problem in the battle of the
sexes: Should the toilet seat be left up or down?
 &HT;    The best advice is just to get over it. Sure, you think the
world would be a lot better place if your mate would just ... But
would it really?
 &HT;    Personal habits take some getting used to. Any two people need
time to adjust to each other, a new lifestyle and new surroundings.
Relax. A routine will develop soon enough, and you will quickly
forget that you were ever uncomfortable.
 &HT;    + ``Don't talk to me before I have my coffee.''
 &HT;    There are morning people and there are night people. And then
there are peppy morning people. If you've married one of those
people who pop out of bed, draw open the shades and sing in the
shower ... first of all, my condolences. On the other hand, your
mate is probably a happy person, which may be why you fell in love
with him or her in the first place.
 &HT;    + ``Isn't the game over yet?''
 &HT;    Husbands watching sports all weekend is one of the most frequent
complaints heard from newlywed women. While women often complain
about their husband's sports-viewing habits, however, many women
actually like watching sports on television, particularly with
their mates. Where couples run into trouble is when watching sports
occupies the entire weekend.
 &HT;    One possible solution is planning specific games and sports to
watch, rather than just watching anything that's on.
 &HT;    Here are some other solutions:
 &HT;    Have a sports party. Invite friends or other couples over to
watch the game.
 &HT;    Participate in a sport together. Join a volleyball team or a
bowling league. Take up tennis or golf. Being involved in a sport
makes it more interesting to watch it on television.
 &HT;    Go to the sporting event together. Rather than lounge in the
easy chair all day Saturday, buy tickets to the local college
football game and make a day of it.
 &HT;    Go do something else on your weekend time together, and listen
to the game on the way.
 &HT;    + Sharing the covers.
 &HT;    There's not much people can do to change their behaviors when
they're fast asleep. Thus, newlyweds often complain about the
spouse's snoring, hogging the covers or kicking them in the middle
of the night.
 &HT;    There are some things both partners can do before falling
asleep, however, that can reduce the occurrence of cover stealing.
For instance, if the partner who steals the blankets dresses more
warmly for bed, he or she may not be as likely to feel cold during
the night. Likewise, if the partner who ends up without covers
during the night dresses more warmly, he or she will not mind as
much when the covers disappear.
 &HT;    Another solution would be to keep an emergency blanket next to
the bed so that whoever finds himself or herself without covers
during the night can use a substitute blanket.
 &HT;    For a more romantic option, try sleeping closer together. Body
heat is better than a blanket any day.

   When Anne Sexton came to teach at McLean Hospital, Eugenia
Plunkett had already been in and out of the hospital for almost
five years. An attractive and precocious high school poet from Fort
Smith, Ark., Plunkett had suffered a nervous breakdown after her
freshman year at Radcliffe. ``She wasn't prepared for the
transformation to Harvard,'' says her younger brother Robert, a
businessman in Fort Smith. ``Her grades had been straight A's
beforehand, but the competition was pretty tough. She wanted to
have more of a social life, but she didn't know how to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been Plunkett who suggested that patient librarian
Margaret Ball invite Sexton to teach at McLean. Although she made
much of being shy, she sent Sexton some of her poems before the
seminar began, and emphasized that she was a big fan. In one note,
she told Sexton, ``I feel like your stringbean girl,'' a reference
to a famous poem (``Little Girl, My Stringbean, My Lovely Woman'')
Sexton wrote on the occasion of her daughter Linda's 11th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The two women corresponded for about a year. Sexton gossiped
about the other patients in the seminar, and enjoyed sharing
confidences with her young acolyte. When Plunkett announced that
she had left her psychiatrist because he had divorced his wife and
refused to embark on an affair with her, Sexton _ no stranger to
the temptations of the therapist's couch _ reacted knowingly:
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have handled it better. Of course you felt rejected,
but it seems too bad that you had to stop seeing him. One thing
I'll say. All the psychiatrists I've seen have been crazy and yet I
learn from them. From your description of him you certainly
wouldn't want to be married to him, but I know the feeling better
than you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton offered heartfelt congratulations when Plunkett published
poems in the Hudson Review and the American Scholar during the
seminar. And she didn't hesitate to criticize Plunkett's work more
firmly than that of the other patients'. Upon receiving one batch
of Plunkett's poems, Sexton wrote her:
</P>
<P>
   ``I find them quite different and not worth much bother on your
part. ... Frost once said a poem should be `lively,' not personal.
I say a poem should be personal _ in the sense of somebody having
really lived something they are writing about.''
</P>
<P>
   At other times, Sexton would proffer advice tempered by her own
considerable self-doubt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Your work is very accomplished. You have tons of talent.
Still, I feel you are holding something back, some emotions you
don't dare speak of. Do you wish it that way, I wonder? And then
again should you listen to me _ the me who is known for spilling
her guts? ... I can't think rationally and you can. I envy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton said she ``envied'' Plunkett's abilities more than once,
and of course the young poet was duly flattered:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was quite proud to hear you envy my poem _ I hadn't expected
that at all, and it is quite a flattering thing to know.''
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1969, Plunkett returned to Arkansas, where she
remained in touch with Sexton. In June, she announced that she had
again been institutionalized _ ``No sweat, though, be out soon, I
think.'' She described the experience of listening to Sexton's
poetry/rock rec-ord, ``Anne Sexton and Her Kind:''
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried all the way through `Her Kind.' ... The music is
haunting, but nothing to the words. Had to hold my aide's hand _
she, poor kid, not having the faintest idea of what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the summer of the moon landing, and Plunkett sent
Sexton a poem about the event. In her last letter to her former
student, Sexton wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased that you sent the poem to me although I didn't
understand it. Your rhyming is very skillful, but I do hear you,
Jeanie, I do hear you sing.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, Plunkett published her only book of poetry,
``If You Listen Quietly,'' which included the poem, ``Fragment for
Anne.'' Sixteen years later, after an adulthood beset with
psychological and physical disorders, she died of a neurological
seizure in Fort Smith at the age of 53.

<P>
   In the fall of 1968, the poet Anne Sexton received an unexpected
invitation. An administrator at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
inquired if she might want to teach a weekly seminar for patients
there.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton was intrigued. She was at the height of her powers. She
had won the 1967 Pulitzer Prize for poetry, and had just been named
Phi Beta Kappa poet at Harvard. The media loved her, and hailed the
New England poetry ``renaissance'' starring Sexton, Robert Lowell,
and Sylvia Plath. A tall, striking beauty often mistaken for an
actress or a model, she would never again be confused with the
restless, intellectually curious Wellesley housewife who had
scratched out her first poems just 12 years before.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she was acutely aware of her own fragility.
Sexton, 40, had been in and out of mental hospitals for more than a
decade. In her journeys ``To Bedlam and Beyond,'' as she named her
first poetry collection, she had come to believe that madness was
the wellspring of true creativity. And McLean ``exerted an odd
fascination'' on her, according to Sexton's biographer Diane
Middlebrook, ``as the hospital of choice for Boston's occasionally
mad artists and poets.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton accepted the invitation. The McLean seminar lasted from
the fall of 1968 until the spring of 1969. Between 15 and 25
patients attended, irregularly, depending on their mental states.
Several hundred of the poems the patients wrote for the seminar are
stored in the Anne Sexton archive at the Ransom Center for the
Humanities at the University of Texas, where Sexton's daughter and
literary executor, Linda Gray Sexton, granted me permission to read
them. And, for the first time, several patients or relatives of
deceased patients have agreed to discuss the seminar and its impact
on their lives.
</P>
<P>
   At McLean, Sexton, the glamorous, seductive, mediagenic poet,
saw visions of her past self _ the helpless, bedraggled mental
patient. As she commented to one of her students: ``I suppose I'm a
person before I'm a poet. As a person, I wanted to tell everyone,
`Look, you're where I was. Come my way, too _ out of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The call came in September of 1968, in a note from Margaret
Ball, the patients' librarian at McLean:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
``Dear Mrs. Sexton, &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past two months, I have been directing quite a
small group of McLean patients who write. Some are quite talented;
some of the poems, especially, are fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard you had, at one time, an interest in the writings
of psychiatric patients; the patient who told me this is a great
admirer of yours and suggested I invite you to address the group. I
would like to amplify her suggestion to include a possible series
of workshop or lecture meetings which you would lead. Your visit or
visits would be immensely valuable to motivate as well as instruct
the patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexton did have an interest in the writings of psychiatric
patients. During her first institutionalization, at Westwood Lodge
in 1956, Sexton met a talented young musician who spoke in words
and images Sexton had never encountered before. ``I was thrilled to
get into the Nut House,'' Sexton later told a friend. ``I found
this girl (very crazy of course) (like me I guess) who talked
language.'' By ``language,'' Sexton meant the bold, figurative
language of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   According to Middlebrook, Sexton created her own Genesis myth
after her first nervous breakdown, as a writer ``born again'' from
the trough of despair. There was a vanity of identification. Her
mental instability linked her to the ``mad'' poets of her own
generation, like John Berryman, Lowell, and Plath, as well as to
Baudelaire, Coleridge, and Rimbaud, the French Symbolist who
claimed inspiration from ``a lengthy, immense, and systematic
derangement of the senses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I found I belonged to the poets,'' Sexton said, and with the
encouragement of her psychiatrist, she started writing poetry. Just
as Sexton herself would offer unbounded encouragement to her
students at McLean, Dr. Martin Orne responded generously to her
first baby steps into her incipient profession. ``He said they were
wonderful,'' Sexton recalled. ``I kept writing and writing and
giving them all to him. ... I kept writing because he was
approving.'' Writes Middlebrook: ``In 1957, poetry had saved her
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Sexton didn't have reservations about
the McLean assignment. ``Anne was quite agitated one day, and
called and said she'd been asked to do a poetry workshop at
McLean,'' says her friend Lois Ames, a poet and therapist who lives
in Sudbury. ``She saw this as an enormous responsibility. `What if
they're suicidal?' she asked. `What if I say something about a poem
that sends them over the edge?''' The pair decided that Ames, an
experienced social worker who was at the time functioning as
biographer, amanuensis, and all-purpose helpmeet for the
anxiety-prone poet, would help her teach the seminars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
McLean as mecca
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That the call came from McLean weighed heavily on Sexton's mind.
Sexton had always wanted to be a patient at McLean, but in her own
view, had never made the grade. McLean, a Harvard teaching
hospital, attracted well-to-do patients from all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was also expensive. Although she lived comfortably with her
husband, a textile executive, and daughters in Wellesley, Mass.,
McLean was a luxury Sexton couldn't afford. At the time of her
first breakdown, Dr. Orne had dispatched her to Westwood Lodge,
which was cheaper than McLean. When she collapsed a second time
within the year, Orne sent her to Glenside in Boston's Jamaica
Plain neighborhood, ``a grim institution for mental patients,''
according to Middlebrook. But Glenside was even less costly than
Westwood and would place less of a financial burden on the Sexton
family.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Ames remembers driving with Sexton to the Tuesday night
poetry seminars, and stopping the car on a bluff overlooking the
vast, landscaped McLean campus that looks more like a prosperous
New England boarding school than a mental institution. (Frederick
Law Olmsted, designer of Boston's Emerald Necklace and New York's
Central Park, and himself later a patient there, chose the site.)
``It would be twilight, and the lights would be coming up, and Anne
would say: `If only I could get a scholarship to McLean, I would be
well.' And I answered, `You don't want to go to McLean, they charge
an arm and a leg, and besides, they never let you out.''' At the
time, McLean generally required a three- to six-month stay, and was
charging patients $70 a day.
</P>
<P>
   But for Sexton, McLean was holy ground, the Tintern Abbey of
Boston, where many of the city's famous poets and artists had at
one time or another repaired to recharge their batteries for
renewed forays into the glamorous world of literature. ``We both
recognized that Sylvia Plath and Robert Lowell had been there, and
she wanted to be in that lineage,'' Ames recalls. ``The same way
she wanted to be buried in Mount Auburn cemetery, where her family
was buried. McLean was very much the bastion of those old WASP
families. It was the mental hospital, the place to go if you were
in trouble in those days. It was like going to Shreve, Crump &AMP;
Low.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekly seminars were held in the patients' library, inside
the new Rehabilitation Building. (The room is now a Patient
Resource Center run by the Manic Depressive and Depressive
Association.) Some of Sexton's initial trepidation about her new
charges was confirmed. From week to week, there was no way of
knowing which patients might show up for the seminar. While some
patients were allowed to meander around the hospital grounds or
even take the subway into town, others emerged from
maximum-security wards with aides, dubbed ``angels,'' holding them
gently by the wrist, indicating that their charges were on suicide
watch. Some patients' conditions varied from hour to hour, not to
mention day by day. A patient who wrote an excellent poem might
then disappear for several weeks until his or her condition
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Perkins, an author and documentary filmmaker now living
in Cambridge, was a patient at McLean in 1968. He described the
seminar in his 1994 memoir, ``Talking to Angels:''
</P>
<P>
   ``She would come every two weeks to meet with a small group of
aspiring poets. It was as boring a two hours as any other, although
some of the students were entertaining. These wackos would rise to
their feet and make up their poems right there, often yelling them
out loud. A chorus of nutcakes. Occasionally, Anne Sexton would
speak, but more often she sat there with the rest of us and let
events swirl around her. If people wanted to argue about poetry or
about poems, that was fine with her. Most of us, and I was one,
could barely raise our heads, let alone write poetry or find
anything intelligent to say.''
</P>
<P>
   One former patient, who has redirected her manic energy into a
successful career in broadcasting, has a less rosy memory of the
proceedings: ``Frankly, I couldn't care less about poetry, but she
was famous and I wanted to meet someone who was that well known.''
This woman called the elegant Sexton ``Sexy Annie,'' and even
questioned her motives for teaching the ``loonies:''

AFTER BATTLING LEUKEMIA, HEIDI ANDERSON GETS BACK TO HER FUTURE

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bentley College volleyball standout Heidi Anderson had no
interest in waking up mornings and finding patches of her long
blond hair _ a victim of the chemotherapy that was so necessary and
so devastating _ clumped on the pillow.
</P>
<P>
   So she had her boyfriend shave her head.
</P>
<P>
   She had no interest in dilly-dallying around about the whole
thing _ OK, maybe didn't quite realize the mess she was in _ and
urged the doctors to open her chest and insert that tube so she
could waste no time in getting her treatments and getting down to
the business of getting better.
</P>
<P>
   They did. It took time. She did get better.
</P>
<P>
   The other day Heidi Anderson, Bentley graduate and leukemia
survivor, was out dress shopping for something to wear this weekend
for a dinner in Marco Island, Fla., where she will be honored as
the winner of the Honda Inspiration Award, presented each year to a
collegiate woman athlete who has overcome great physical adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Her once straight blond hair grew back darker and more curly and
is long and she plans on growing it longer. She is two and a half
years out from the bone marrow transplant she received after it
became clear the chemotherapy wasn't going to take care of her
leukemia. She has heard that some doctors say that three years out
and you're considered cured, others that it's five years. And even
then they hedge and say you're 98 percent cured.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers in the past couple of years have been more about beating
the odds _ the chance of survival was 30 percent originally, 30
percent again in the bone marrow transplant, but then there was a
chance of surviving the transplant and coming out of it with some
other ailment _ than they have been about the numbers that used to
matter. The number of kills she had as an outside hitter, the
number of service aces, the scores of games took a back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it much,'' she said of the leukemia
numbers. ``Some doctors said when you're three years out they
consider you cured, but I don't think about it any more. I don't
think it's coming back. I don't want to live that way.''
</P>
<P>
   She is living life the way she intended before leukemia
interrupted it for a year and a half. She graduated from Bentley
last month and in August starts her training with the Marriott
Corporation as an assistant controller. Her boyfriend, Matt Genest,
the one who cut her hair, the one she met on the first day freshmen
reported to Bentley, the one she borrowed the Berwick Academy
baseball cap from to cover her bald head also missed a year and a
half of school.
</P>
<P>
   He moved in with her family in Jamul, Calif. to help when she
was sick. They both doubled up on courses to actually get out ahead
of schedule, considering the time they missed, and both graduated
with honors.
</P>
<P>
   She was a key member of the Bentley volleyball last fall, was
elected captain by players who barely knew her and helped the team
to a semifinal finish in the Northeast 10 Conference, ironically
the same place they ended up days before her cancer ordeal began.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson made the All Conference team as a freshman and helped
her team to the NCAA Northeast Regionals. She came back the next
season and coach Sandy Hoffmann asked her to be more of a team
leader. She was.
</P>
<P>
   But as the season went on her joints ached more and more and she
became more and more sick. Doctors thought she might have a virus
and had her sit out late in the season. She talked her way into
playing in the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played all weekend,'' she said. ``I was fatigued at times
and hurt at times, but I played.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the doctor called and said she wanted Anderson to have
more tests with a specialist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   They borrowed a car and Genest drove her to the hospital that
evening. Later that night she was told she had leukemia, her
parents and younger sister flew in from California and soon she had
no hair, had a tube in her chest, wouldn't leave the hospital for
weeks and would be in treatment for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst moment was when we were sitting there and the doctor
was explaining about the tube,'' Hoffmann said. ``That's when it
really hits you. I had to leave the room.''
</P>
<P>
   There were tough times ahead, though Anderson feels lucky she
didn't get nearly as sick in treatment as many people do. She has
been told she will not be able to have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very tough, but like my mother says, you never know
what the medical field is doing, they're coming up with things left
and right,'' she said. ``And there are kids out there that want
moms.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the projected two years of chemotherapy in seven
phases and there was getting to the end of the fifth phase and
being told that the chemotherapy had been suppressed but not wiped
out and she needed the bone marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that was probably the hardest was when they said I
was not going back to school, we were going to to have to try
something else after we had done this for a year,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Both her sisters were a perfect match for a transplant and she
received her bone marrow from her older sister, Julia.
</P>
<P>
   The transplant was a success and she got back to school in the
fall of 1996 and tried to get back to volleyball but was not yet
physically able. That was tough. So she served as kind of an
assistant coach.
</P>
<P>
   She kept working on her strength and conditioning and last fall
was ready to go. Still, there were drawbacks. She did not have her
old leaping ability so was better suited for defensive work in the
back lines than up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our first practices we were doing a lot of jumping in
training and she was going through the drills and was so upset that
some of the freshmen were beating her,'' Hoffmann said. ``Other
players might have quit, knowing they were not going to be the
player they could have been as a senior. If they knew how much
strength training and conditioning they'd have to do, more so than
other people, they wouldn't have come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson had no doubts. She was determined to do so as she spent
her time in the hospital and charted her own medications and
treatments. As the cards and letters and jerseys from players at
Harvard and Alaska and dozens of other teams and players she had
come in contact with poured in. As she planned with doctors _
including Dr. Robin Joyce at Beth Israel who her mother, Pat, raves
about _ her return to Bentley and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   She turned 23 last Sunday and this Sunday evening in Florida,
Honda will recognize the way she came back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really had a dignity about it, a strength,'' said Pat
Anderson, who has had people tell her about watching Heidi take
things on with her chin up. ``I think a lot of people looked at
that and thought, if this happens to me, I'm going to give it my
best shot.''

   The Boston Celtics once won 11 championships in 13 seasons. The
run began on Saturday, April 13, 1957, in Boston Garden with a
stirring 125-123 double-overtime victory over the St. Louis Hawks,
and it ended Monday, May 5, 1969, in the Fabulous Forum with an
upset 108-106 victory over the Los Angeles Lakers. There was one
playing link between Title No. 1 and Title No. 11 _ Bill Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls have won six championships in the last eight
seasons. Their run began Wednesday, June 12, 1991, in the Great
Western Forum with a 108-101 win over the Los Angeles Lakers and it
was expanded Sunday, June 14, 1998, in the Delta Center with an
87-86 win over the Utah Jazz. There have been two playing links _
Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Two great athletic teams. Two superb legacies. Two entirely
different worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have absolutely no idea what life was like in
Russell's time. The Bulls have never taken an overnight train. They
don't scrunch themselves into cabs. They don't change planes. They
don't stay two to a room in second-rate hotels with laughably small
meal money.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have their own charter plane. They stay in the very
best hotels. They never touch a piece of luggage.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have the finest medical assistance available. In the
early Russell days, the trainer didn't even travel.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls, like most NBA clubs, are a team of millionaires. The
Celtics worried about lining up offseason jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls have a palatial locker room and their own practice
facility. The Celtics used to dress in a slanted locker room in the
old, old Garden in which the tall guys stood at the top of the roof
slant and the small guys dressed at the bottom. Lockers? How about
nails? They practiced in such places as the Cambridge YMCA and
Tobin Gym _ after begging for the time.
</P>
<P>
   All these differences make it far easier for the Bulls to play
at their best. The flip side is that the old Celtics had far fewer
distractions. They never had off-day press conferences. They had no
endorsement deals. They were inherently hungrier and more dedicated
because, well, just because. So it was easier for them to focus on
the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   There are many ways of evaluating the differences between the
Russell Celtics and the Jordan Bulls. Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   Argument No. 1: Less Is Easier.
</P>
<P>
   In order to win his first nine titles, Russell and his mates had
to play two series a year. Win eight games and you're a champ. In
order to win their six, Michael and Scottie have had to win four
series annually. They need to win almost twice as many games (15)
in order to get their rings.
</P>
<P>
   It stands to reason that the more games you play, the more peril
exists. Just because you're supposed to win doesn't mean you're
going to.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Historical Advantage: Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Argument No. 2: Who'd You Beat?
</P>
<P>
   Russell began play in an eight-team league. The best 80
basketball players in the world were concentrated on those teams.
Even the worst teams had, in the context, very good players in
reserve. When he won championship No. 11, the NBA still had only 14
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls' championship run began seven years ago in a 27-team
league. It's now up to 29. Almost no one has a decent bench.
Centers are scarce. The talent is pathetically dispersed, and some
of the best players choose to stay in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Historical Advantage: Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Argument No. 3: We Coulda Had More
</P>
<P>
   Only Houston hardheads would deny that the Rockets won a pair of
championships (1994, 1995) that would have been Chicago's had
Jordan not taken his famous sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. But does anyone outside St. Louis believe the Hawks would
have won in 1958 if Russell had not injured his ankle? Twelve out
of 13 sounds pretty impressive.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Historical Advantage: No one.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Argument No. 4: We Don't Need No Stinkin' Seventh Games.
</P>
<P>
   We respect the Russell Celtics because they knew how to win the
so-called Big Game. Russell played in 11 winner-take-all games, 10
seventh games (five in the Finals) and one fifth. He was 11-0, and
in those games, he averaged 18 points and 30 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has a sparse Game 7 resume, which is to his credit. His
teams have been so dominant that there have been only two seventh
games in the seven-year Chicago run. They are, of course, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Historical Advantage: No one.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Argument No. 5. Modern Must Be Better.
</P>
<P>
   You hear the word ``athleticism'' so much these days, you'd
think players of the past didn't know how to run and jump.
</P>
<P>
   So hear this, and hear it well: William F. Russell would come
out of nowhere to block a Michael Jordan shot just as easily and
just as frequently as he did to Elgin Baylor, Jerry West, and Oscar
Robertson, to name three of the many NBA players of the '60s who
could step into the NBA today to make All-Star teams.
</P>
<P>
   And hear this: Sam Jones was a better guard than any current NBA
backcourt player not named Michael Jordan. Yeah, that includes Gary
Payton, Penny Hardaway, and anyone else you can name.
</P>
<P>
   And this: Before there was Scottie Pippen, there was John
Havlicek, who never had to come out of a game and who, at age 37,
shut off a prime-of-life Dr. J in the 1977 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between the '60s and the '90s is the coaching
approach, not necessarily the inherent athletic ability. Everything
is geared to defense today. In Russell's third championship season,
1960, the Celtics averaged 120 shots a game. In Jordan's six
championship seasons, the Chicago annual average is 86. The fewest
shots averaged by a Russell title team were 101 in 1968-69. The
game concept was entirely different.
</P>
<P>
   The modern defenses are more complex and sophisticated. Russell
&AMP; Co. had scouting reports and a memory bank. Jordan and Friends
have videotapes and computer printout tendencies. Meanwhile,
offenses are more cautious _ the fast break has almost disappered
as an art form _ and the players, however athletic, are woefully
incomplete once you take away their Plan A. The old guys were more
well-rounded basketball players. The modern defenses are combating
more and more players who really don't know how to play. Have
Russell anchor one of today's defenses and he would be even more
devastating. How about that?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Historical advantage: No one.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Bill Russell and Michael Jordan are the two greatest
demonstrated winners in American team sport history. On sport's Mt.
Olympus, they occupy the two finest houses.
</P>
<P>
   So whose best team would win?
</P>
<P>
   I don't know. But we're definitely going seven.

 UNDATED: ... the ``loonies:''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, Sexy Annie, why are you doing this?' She
replied that she wanted to `give back,' this, that, and the other.
I always had the impression that she was teaching us either as a
way to gather more material for her poems or she was doing it for
her biography, since her biographer was in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, there's no evidence that this suggestion is true.
Sexton kept few notes of the sessions, and most of those were
teaching guides for herself. She wrote only one poem, ``Out at the
Mental Hospital'' (``No one has been tamed out at McLean ...''),
about her experiences at McLean, and never published it.
</P>
<P>
   Former student Eleanor Morris has a fonder memory of the
sessions with Sexton:
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a mental image of Anne leaning on something in the
library, maybe a piano, and the rest of us sitting around in
chairs. She assigned us exercises, and you had to read your own
poetry, which took a lot of courage. What I remember most is the
blue, blue eyes. Her eyes were a piece of hope for me to see every
week, they were daring me to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Assessing the poems
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What was the poetry like? Several hundred poems are sitting in
the Sexton archive in Texas, mostly unread until now. A few of the
poems are very good, and were later published in literary journals
like the Yale Review, the Hudson Review, and the American Scholar.
Most of the poems were student quality, some good enough to publish
in the hospital newsletter. And some were just blots, words
scrawled on paper by men and women shocked, both literally and
figuratively, onto the verges of catatonia.
</P>
<P>
   One anonymous patient even satirized his mental predicament:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once I could
</P>
<P>
   and now I can't
</P>
<P>
   Write poetry
</P>
<P>
   I merely rant
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as Dr. Orne had done for her, Sexton believed in
encouraging all of her McLean students. When John Swan wrote a poem
called ``Kids,'' describing his feelings for his two young
daughters, Sexton handed back his work with ``GOOD'' swathed across
the page in capital letters. This fragment of Swan's evoked an
emotional response from Sexton:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This last time
</P>
<P>
   When the children were told I was off
</P>
<P>
   For another rest ...
</P>
<P>
   Lynn cried quietly ...
</P>
<P>
   Her real cry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She wrote: ``Powerful _ maybe better than anything Lowell or
Sexton has done on the subject.'' The praise was real, and her
comment anything but casual. At the time, Sexton perceived Lowell
as an important competitor, and both poets had trouble expressing
affection for their children in their poems.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Eugenia Plunkett, one of her more gifted students,
chided Sexton for being too solicitous of her students' feelings.
``You seem afraid to dis-courage anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter, Sexton responded:
</P>
<P>
   ``You are right. I don't like to discourage anyone at McLean. I
feel that everyone has something to say and will perhaps, in time,
have more important things to say. Poetry led me by the hand out of
madness. I am hoping I can show others that route.''
</P>
<P>
   But Plunkett's complaint wasn't quite accurate. When Sexton
sensed that one of her students could take constructive criticism,
she freely dished it out. She continually pressed one of her poets,
who later published a small collection of his poems, to push
himself beyond writing fragments, and expand into poetical form. He
sent her these lines from a poem called ``Anticipating Sexton'':
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I thought her eyes were green
</P>
<P>
   before she came. ... The scene
</P>
<P>
   was her with lanky bone
</P>
<P>
   and skirt above bare
</P>
<P>
   thigh past knee. ...
</P>
<P>
   Exalted like a queen among sin
</P>
<P>
   and those who only half dared to reach for help. But I believed
</P>
<P>
   that anywhere she'd come would be where
</P>
<P>
   all sorts of thoughts, ill-formed, might get conceived,
</P>
<P>
   and come out twitching, perfect infants through the hair
</P>
<P>
   I imagined she had never let them shave.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed, before meeting, to be, in that way, say, brave.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And she wrote back: ``Good ending,'' and asked for ``another
verse about what she is like _ however disappointing to me
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps better than her student Plunkett, Sexton, who had
already attempted suicide, understood how close to the precipice
some of her students were standing. Several wrote about their
suicide watches. One not-untypical fragment:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Half the skill of succeeding at suicide
</P>
<P>
   Comes with having a decent knife.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The needs are so immense at McLean,'' Sexton wrote to Plunkett
halfway through the seminar. ``And although I try to meet them I
generally fail.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pulling away
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1969, conflicting commitments _ a director had
invited her to stage her play ``Mercy Street'' in Manhattan _
started pulling Sexton away from the McLean seminar. She taught her
last class in June. She corresponded with several of the patients
for a few years after the class; although she lost touch with them,
several of them followed her high-profile career in the newspapers
and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, the intensely self-critical and depressive
Sexton viewed the seminar as a failure. In December 1973 she
gathered some of the McLean poems and notes into a manila folder
and scrawled a note in felt-tipped pen on the outside cover:
</P>
<P>
   ``First teachings of creative writing _ 1969 (very difficult due
to my insufficient knowledge of handling groups and the fact that
the group was constantly changing and the aides were easily mixed
up with the poets _ Decide more commitment on the part of the poet
is needed for me to be able to teach well.)''
</P>
<P>
   The students seemed to love Sexton, for her celebrity, for her
own struggles with mental illness, and for the effort she invested
in the course. The librarian Margaret Ball, who sent Sexton
periodic updates on the patients' lives between the seminars,
informed her more than once that her works were stolen from the
hospital library more than any other author's: ```All My Pretty
Ones' (replacement volume 4) lasted 1 week on the shelf before
stolen. ... It's their highest compliment, because usually they're
so honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Perkins, who remembers Sexton as ``very pretty and very
nervous,'' writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``I've since come to appreciate how difficult it must have been
for Anne Sexton to come back to the hospital and deal with a group
of loonies. She had been there herself. Maybe she felt she could
help one of us. Maybe she did.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not literally true that Sexton had been at McLean herself.
But, in a cruel reversal of the teacher-student relationship,
Sexton's awful wish was finally granted; she was admitted to McLean
for five days of psychiatric examination in 1973. Her former
student Eleanor Morris met Sexton unexpectedly in the North Belknap
medium security hall. ``She remembered me from the seminar, but we
didn't talk much,'' Morris recalls. ``She looked so awful ... my
heart went out to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the flesh was the terrible leveling of mental illness.
Sexton, the elegant, chain-smoking Pulitzer Prize winner cast
adrift among her student-patients on the desperate ocean of
unhappiness. Sexton was just one year away from her own suicide,
firmly embarked upon what one of her poetry cycles called the
``Awful Rowing Towards God.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris still remembers her clock-radio waking her on Saturday,
Oct. 5, 1974. A newsreader announced that the poet Anne Sexton had
died. ``It just said she had died, but I knew she had committed
suicide, and I spent the whole morning crying,'' Morris says.
</P>
<P>
   Morris still has a copy of a book of poems that Sexton gave her
after one of the seminars, a 1966 collection called ``Live or
Die.'' On the flyleaf, Sexton wrote: ``My directive is LIVE _ to
Ellie.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Morris is living and writing poetry in Concord.

CLINTON'S MEDIA TORMENTORS HAVE SOME EXPLAINING TO DO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steven Brill has just played the dirtiest trick imaginable in
the media game. He went around to the media zealots stoking the
flames and tending the smudgepots of the Get-Clinton Scandal
Machine. And he asked them a lot of questions _ (begin itals) on
the record, (end itals) if you can believe that quaint old
journalistic gimmick _ and then wrote down what they said, and
named them right there in his new magazine, ``Brill's Content.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not all. He compared what they say (begin itals) now (end
itals) to what they said (begin itals) then, (end itals), in the
heady days when Mt. Monica erupted and the scandal-mongers among
the media pack went berserk. Is there a more apt term for the media
meltdown dissected so pitilessly by Brill?
</P>
<P>
   It's the oldest trick in the journalistic notebook _ asking
questions on the record, and recording the answers verbatim. And
Brill, the brains behind ``Court TV,'' has scored impressively with
his inaugural issue of Content. He is not content with rehashing
the same old secretly sourced or sourceless gabble that has come to
characterize the Clinton-era journalism. Brill's stuff is all
straight-up.
</P>
<P>
   And an ugly picture it is. From the malevolent Lucianne
Goldberg, book agent to the duplicitous Linda Tripp, betrayer of
Monica's crush and confidences, to the incredibly-plugged-in
Michael Isikoff of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   The early line on Brill's 30,000-word autopsy of this D.C.
dustup was that Kenneth Starr, right-wing tobacco lawyer, impaled
himself _ again _ with his admission that he and his agents have
routinely leaked secret stuff to reporters in the scandal circuit.
But having read the first two-thirds of Brill's rehash (the rest
was lost in faxland, alas), I'd suggest the far more damaging stuff
is what comes out of the mouths of the players _ the Clinton-haters
like Goldberg and Tripp, their lawyers, agents, and handmaidens in
the prosecutorial corps, and the journalists themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek, for decades a smouldering second fiddle to Time
magazine, made a commitment at the corporate level to play up the
scandal. Isikoff and Howard Fineman, a Newsweek political writer,
wangled themselves lucrative cash deals with television networks
who saw, in an age of deconstructing viewership, a way to slash
their way back to profitability. Just when the O.J. trial left the
cable network news people sucking wind, Monica pops up to do for
kneepads and dry cleaners what O.J. did for bloody gloves and Bruno
Magli shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Newsweek wanted to do to Time what The Washington Post did to
The New York Times during Watergate _ leapfrog a long-standing
leader in the field. But Brill's reporting lays out in embarrassing
detail just how involved Isikoff was from the beginning in helping
construct the scandal: ``To Isikoff, he was simply musing aloud
about what would make a legitimate Newsweek story. To the Goldbergs
and Tripp, he was writing out specs. And by the end of October,
Isikoff's hopes had been fulfilled on both counts.''
</P>
<P>
   The question for Newsweek editors is: Was Isikoff ahead on this
story because he was part of the Get-Clinton conspiracy? Do
Newsweek's superiors countenance this kind of hanky-panky? Isikoff
was meeting regularly with Goldberg and Tripp, he was colluding
with prosecutor Starr on just how to time disclosures to exert
maximum pressure on witnesses Starr was trying to rubber-hose into
betraying Clinton. It smells like an Arkansas hog farm.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine how Watergate would be discredited, if we'd
learned Woodward and Bernstein were conspiring with John Dean,
suggesting traps he might set for Nixon, or playing games with
selected extracts of questionable tapes? Brill's verdict is
chilling: ``What makes the media's performance a true scandal, a
true example of an institution being corrupted at its core, is that
the competition for scoops so bewitched almost everyone that they
let the man in power (Starr) write the story _ once Tripp and
Goldberg put it together for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the Goldberg-Tripp desire for a lucrative book
contract about seamy White House sex''... an author in quest of
material teamed up with a prosecutor in quest of a crime, and most
of the press became a cheering section for the combination that
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Where were the Newsweek editors? Why didn't some bosses at ABC
and NBC rein in their heavy-breathing, impeachment-predicting
yarn-spinners? Why did the once-proud Big 3 network news divisions
plunge so readily in the sheepdip? Are the cable news networks so
shabby that they'll hype their ratings so crudely? Yes! in the case
of CNBC, MSNBC, and Fox, at least. They lured viewers with
half-baked fantasies about oral sex in the Oval Office. What
happened to the standards? (begin itals) What standards? (end
itals) TV journalism no longer has any standards, networks
included. And Newsweek has a lot of explaining to do.
</P>
<P>
   For readers who have long suspected that many media
personalities were hyping the various Clinton scandals for less
than pure reasons, Brill's article is a goldmine. Read it and weep
for the shoddy business that so much of Washington's celebrity
journalism has become.

RUSSIA'S ART AND ARCHITECTURE: A THOUSAND YEARS IN 3 HOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Onion domes. Icons. Gogol. Moussorgsky. Saints who have been
mummified, for public veneration. Stalin mummified, for the same
reason. ``The Face of Russia,'' a three-part TV series that airs on
PBS three successive Wednesdays at 10, presents a grand collage of
images and sounds, a millennium's worth. It's all laid out for you
by James H. Billington, the Librarian of Congress and a noted
historian who has been visiting Russia for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Billington fairly drowns in all the material he's given himself
to cover. A thousand years of Russian art, music, literature, film,
drama, poetry, religion, and politics is simply too much to tackle
in three hours, and as a result the shows seem scattered, and
Billington's choices sometimes arbitrary. In 1994, producer Daniel
Wilson and writer-narrator Rod MacLeish devoted the same amount of
time to a three-part television series just on the Hermitage, St.
Petersburg's 1,000 room palace-museum. Time magazine art critic
Robert Hughes had eight hours on TV to give his occasionally
outrageous opinions on 350 years of American art in his ``American
Visions'' series last year _ and Hughes kept his discussion to
visual arts. Billington could have used at least eight hours to
unravel a millennium's worth of Russian culture. As it is, his
series comes off as the couch potato equivalent of the tourist who
breezes through all of Russia in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Billington sometimes manages to go beyond the obligatory
_ the Hermitage, the Kremlin, the larger-than-life rulers from
Catherine the Great to Lenin. He takes us to a tiny, pristine
country church, and to the grandiose Church of the Transfiguration,
with its bouquet of 22 onion domes and its 30,000 hand-hewn wooden
shingles. The Church of the Transfiguration is on a remote island
where it couldn't have been seen by many: It was built for God, not
man.
</P>
<P>
   Enormity and excess are among the themes Billington treats in
this televised tapestry. Take bells. In Christianized Russia, they
conveyed the Lord's message, and because their power only extended
as far as their sound, they got bigger and bigger until Russia had
the biggest bell in the world, which is still ensconced in Moscow's
Kremlin. It has never been rung, because it is too heavy to get off
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Icons were the first art that Russia made her own, and it's with
icons that Billington begins, showing us mournful images of a grave
and tender mother of God cheek-to-cheek with a Christ who is a
miniature adult rather than a child. One of the show's strengths is
the chance it gives us to see icons not as we would in a museum _
static, hung against a white wall, behind glass _ but in use, being
paraded in streets, being prayed to.
</P>
<P>
   The icons that survived Stalin are often in sad shape, covered
in soot from worshippers' candles. While the fall of Communism
meant that icons could be freely exhibited once again, there is
little money to restore them. Skipping through the centuries,
Billington notes how important ancient icons were to such early
20th century giants of Russian art as Kandinsky and Tatlin. And he
shows contemporary icon painters at work, grinding precious lapis
and malachite into rich pigments bound with the yolks of eggs. The
desire of these artists whose lives have seen so much upheaval to
make art that will last a thousand years is a touching contrast
with their peers in the West, many of whom don't mind making art
that is short-lived either by intent or sloppy construction.
</P>
<P>
   Billington begins the second installment of ``The Face of
Russia'' with a classic contrast. In tones fit for a Halloween
creep-out, he describes a terrified visitor approaching the Czar's
inner sanctum, at the end of a maze of dark, cramped chambers in
Moscow's Kremlin. Then he moves to the ``window on the West,'' St.
Petersburg, ``a city designed not so much for people as for
parades,'' he calls it. Just as an icon was part of an icon screen,
so a St. Petersburg palace, however many acres it covered, was
merely part of an even grander design.
</P>
<P>
   The two great women empresses who ruled Russia in the 18th
century, Elizabeth and Catherine the Great, turned the capital into
a glittering stage set. There was misery backstage, though _ all
those millions of people living in poverty and ignorance. The
nightmare of their hopelessness found expression in the writing of
Gogol.
</P>
<P>
   You have to be really crazy about Gogol to forgive Billington's
concentration on this one author at the expense of a parade of
writers including Pushkin, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Chekhov, and
Turgenev. Gogol translated into English and then onto TV doesn't
have the force of the footage of Russian icons, architecture, or
opera. This weakest part of the series ends on a promising note,
though, ironically with Gogol's own words: ``Only in music does man
have freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Music and film are Billington's focus for the third and final
episode, Moussorgsky and Eisenstein his stars. While Tchaikovksy
and other composers were looking toward the West, Moussorgsky was
peering deep into the Russian soul. It's perhaps this search for
the most Russian examples of Russian art, especially art linked to
Russian history, that leads Billington to devote precious time to
realist artists like Ilya Repin, painter of impoverished peasants,
and to all but ignore great movements like Constructivism.
</P>
<P>
   In Eisenstein's epic ``October,'' Bolshevik soldiers storm
Rastrelli's great staircase in the Winter Palace to take over the
government. The real takeover, Billington points out, was utterly
lacking in such drama. ``More were injured in filming the
fiction,'' he notes, ``than in the real event.'' Russian film, he
says, is an example of a recurring three-step phenomenon in that
country: the wholesale takeover of an art form from another nation;
its transformation into something wildly inventive and uniquely
Russian; and its breakdown and dissipation. The same thing happened
with classical ballet, an art first borrowed from France, then
brought to its late 19th century zenith in Russia, where it is now
in disarray. In the public mind, ballet is indelibly associated
with Russia. Curiously, it's an art Billington barely mentions.
</P>
<P>
   While he doesn't come out and say that the Russia of today is a
mess, neither does Billington try to construct a happy ending for
his series. Near the end is a particularly dismal image. In front
of the palaces of the Hermitage, one of the world's most glorious
architectural ensembles, is a giant inflatable plastic toy palace,
for people to bounce on.

 &HT;    PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS KEEP MILITARY SKILLS SHARP _ FOR A PRICE
 &HT;    For release Saturday, June 20.

Times News Service.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a maneuver dubbed ``Operation Dino Mite,'' a
military helicopter hovered over a deep ravine, lowered a sling and
pulled up fossils of a 6-foot-tall Thescelasaurus dinosaur for
transport to Montana State University's museum.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Oregon and towns throughout Missouri, troops have
built athletic fields for schools and communities. And in
``Operation Reefex,''(cq) they have dumped 85 old combat vehicles
and tanks off the New Jersey shore to serve as a reef.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the post-Cold War military and its ``innovative
readiness'' training program. Launched in 1992 under the leadership
of then-Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., it
was born out of concern that the troops might have too much time on
their hands without a Soviet threat to confront.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the U.S. armed forces have been downsized
dramatically and stretched thin as they have been dispatched to
trouble spots around the globe. But the civil-military programs
have continued, despite questions about how carefully they have
been monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Although most projects have been short-range, low-budget items,
a major exception can be found on remote Annette Island in
southwestern Alaska. There, four branches of the armed services are
at work on a five-year project costing at least $20 million to
build 14 miles of gravel road, which the state has promised to pave
later for an estimated $15 million. The road will connect the tiny
Tsimshian Indian village of Metlakatla, population 1,600, to the
landing site for a planned ferry service that would be less than a
mile to the mainland, compared to the 15-mile trip now.
</P>
<P>
   This town on the only Indian reservation in the state had
unsuccessfully lobbied the federal and state governments for
decades to build the road, until they hooked up with the Department
of Defense. There they had a crucial ally in Sen. Ted Stevens, a
Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee and its
defense subcommittee, making him the most powerful senator when it
comes to deciding how the Pentagon will spend money. Moreover,
Stevens is famous for steering federal dollars in the direction of
his home state.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Stevens denied that the senator had proposed
``Operation Alaskan Road,'' as the project is called, but
acknowledged that his committee role put him in a position to make
sure it would be funded. ``It has been a department initiative, and
we've supported it,'' said John Raffetto, a spokesman for Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska road project, costing more than $5 million last year,
consumed nearly one-third of the $16 million annual budget for
civil-military projects for all states. But Raffetto bristled at
the suggestion that the project was pork-barrel spending for a road
that will easily cost $22,000 per island resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you insinuating that $20 million (over five years) is too
expensive for that much training?'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of
Congress, has raised questions about whether the Pentagon is
keeping tabs on its civilian projects, particularly the Alaska road
construction effort. ``The (Office of the Secretary of Defense) has
provided limited and inconsistent oversight,'' the accounting
office concluded in a report issued last March.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the ``training'' benefits were sometimes
questionable. Marines whose mission was to oversee fuel supplies
were detailed to do construction work, and combat engineers were
assigned work that bore little relation to combat-readiness,
including plumbing, masonry, and finished-work carpentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, it appeared the goal of completing the projects
took priority over the goal of providing valid valid military
training,'' said the accounting office. The study also said that
the Defense Department kept no accurate count of the number of
these projects, estimated at more than 130 nationwide last year,
and that officials had no actual cost total, since the various
services were absorbing expenses from their operations budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Alaska Road has required a major logistics effort,
including building a base camp of 37 buildings to house and feed
300 persons, including the National Guard and reservists from as
far away as Missouri and Massachusetts, who are shuttled in and out
on two-week shifts for their annual training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Already the undertaking has brought in 850 Marines, who spent 23
days on ships sailing to and from the island from their base in San
Diego. Bringing in heavy equipment, including a rock crusher,
five-ton dump trucks and a bulldozer, required three deliveries by
the military's biggest plane, the C-5 Galaxy. The planes flew in
from a National Guard base in New York at a cost of $12,605 per
flight hour, not counting the expense for the seven-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials described the road construction as
an example of doing for Americans what the U.S. military often does
in foreign countries where troops are stationed. ``This is a great
project,'' said Lt. Col. Kevin Kregcarek, spokesman for the Joint
Services Pacific Command, overseer for the Alaska road work.
</P>
<P>
   As for the questions the General Accounting Office raised about
training, Kregcarek said, ``I didn't see anything off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more generalists in the military, he added. ``You learn
to adapt and you build on that expertise and you get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon public affairs department, in a faxed response to
questions about the program, said this week that the department has
tightened up procedures for the program and directed all services
to determine whether there is an ``increase in training costs'' in
civilian projects.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also defended the use of the program to deploy
military doctors and nurses to assist in low-income communities
instead of confining their work to the military. ``Training in real
world scenarios builds unit and individual morale, contributes to
recruiting and retention, and provides a 'double bang' for our
military training resource tax dollars,'' it said.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN _ Perhaps no one in America has sacrificed
as much for marital relations in America as Bill Bradford II, one
of the inventors of the Johnny-Light. Two years ago, Bradford, a
resident of Burleson near Fort Worth, gave up a $90,000-a-year job
as an electrical engineer to market the device. The Johnny-Light
warns women in the middle of the night if some bonehead has left

   CSIBLEY-COLUMN _ ATLANTA _ Ellen Bryan _ Mrs. Wright Bryan _
died at the age of 93 years. It's funny the things that stick in
your mind about a person you don't know well, but cherish like you
cherish unexpected laughter and a crazy, odd meeting. Mrs. Bryan's
husband was editor of The Atlanta Journal, a newspaper we on The
Atlanta Constitution considered our unlikely, unloved competition.
But we did like the Bryans and rejoice in Ellen's humor and
goodwill.(Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED 6/16.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ We live in an enlightened age, right? More

truly makes them attractive. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

   REAL-LIFE _ So, let that Giuliani fellow worry about all those
folks up in New York City, the ones who need a hug and a smile and
a weekend in the country. I've got enough to keep me going right
here. And that's no exaggeration. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SALAMANDER-POEM _ AUSTIN _ U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks,
mixing rhyme and reason, kept the Barton Springs Pool open by
denying attempts to stop the city from cleaning the spring-fed pool
that is habitat to an endangered salamander and a cool respite for
Central Texans. In a 16-line poem and a 20-page opinion, the judge
took literary and legal swings at the Endangered Species Act,
ruling that the city's cleaning does not harm the 3-inch
salamander, which lives only in the local springs. (Copelin, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

   SMART-CAMPS _ Forget canoeing and horseback riding. These

   STREET-MINISTER _ RIVIERA BEACH _ About a year ago, after a
prophetic vision, Rev. Lessye Charlow set out to drive the drug
trade from her street. A minister for 45 years, she knows only one
way how. Several evenings a week, she wields a second-hand crucifix
and a personalized Bible, with the Red Sea miracle flagged by a
yellow Post-It note, and marches down the middle of West 33rd,
filling dealers and admirers alike with dread. (Trontz, Palm Beach

   LOTTA-CATS-RULING _ WEST PALM BEACH , Fla. _ Catherine Bradley,
the ``cat lady'' of Palm Beach, can feed wild cats now without
pussy-footing around the law. The Palm Beach County Commission on

wild cat colonies as long as they register with the Animal Care and

<P>
   BEER-MSKUBE _ Along with the darker Altbiers of nearby
Dusseldorf and the spritzy white beers of Berlin, Kolsch is the
least familiar of German styles in the United States. It's a
different kind of ale (an English word Germans never use), light as
a sister's kiss, pale as summer corn, served in a cylindrical

mixer manuals from around the same time and found the recipe. And

   YBORFLA _ TAMPA _ I strolled and shopped by day and crawled bar
to bar at night. This is the way to see Tampa's Ybor City. Ybor
City draws huge weekend crowds for its nightlife. Nightclubs are
shoulder-to-shoulder along the main street, Seventh Avenue, like
cheapskates at an open bar. That wasn't the case about 20 years ago
when Ybor was a crumbling, neglected, dangerous-at-night
neighborhood. (Lomartire, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SEASIDE _ SEASIDE, Fla. _ This small town built next to the Gulf
of Mexico gives contradictory first impressions. You see a
Victorian village with turn-of-the-century turrets, verandas and
picket fences. But on closer inspection it looks like a movie set
too perfect to be a real town. In fact, Seaside, which was the
location for the new movie The Truman Show starring Jim Carrey, is
not historic, unless 17 years _ the first house was built in 1981 _
counts as vintage. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   SEASIDEFLA-ARCHITECTURE _ SEASIDE, Fla. _ So what do people do
in this Architectural Digest-perfect town? One would think the Gulf
of Mexico would be the main attraction. No, indeed. Houses are what
draw sightseers, many of whom are architects and urban planners,
who come here to admire and photograph the real estate. (Blackerby,
Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SUWANNEE-HOUSEBOAT _ SUWANNEE, Fla. _ I'm on the Suwannee. The
houseboat is real and we're cruising lazily up the river
immortalized in Stephen Foster's song Old Folks at Home, a perfect
place to remember old daydreams. Our cruise begins at Miller's
Marina in the town of Suwannee, where the river empties into the
gulf on Florida's West Coast. The lower area of the river is a
national wildlife refuge. (Zent, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

 &HT;    Cookbooks provide delicious morsels of literary pleasure
 &HT;    By Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A ritual of summer is to stretch out beside the
pool or on the beach, or curl up on the patio or porch with a good
book. For those who read with a mixing spoon in one hand _ and
those who just love to eat _ the book in their laps is often a
cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   These are perfect choices for a light read, easily interrupted.
It doesn't matter if the cell phone rings or a friend drops by.
</P>
<P>
   The lazy days of summer arrive officially next week, so we went
looking for cookbooks that are a good read. We wanted more than
just a collection of recipes. Some that we found are interwoven
with the memories of life. Others focus on learning the techniques
rather than the precise ingredients that make a great dish. One is
a biography.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tidal wave of low-fat books continues, there are none
in this list. These books may be a light read, but they certainly
don't qualify as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   However, the fascination with Italian cookery continues. Two
books this season focus on life and food in the Sicilian-American
communities, one in the Little Italy of Manhattan and the other in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a bunch to put in a bookbag when you go to the beach or
back yard:
</P>
<P>
   E The Man Who Ate Everything, by Jeffrey Steingarten (Knopf,
$27.50). If irreverence is your bag, pick up this book by the food
critic of Vogue magazine. Don't expect recipes, though there are a
few tucked in peripherally, much the way some mystery writers do
these days.
</P>
<P>
   This is a writer who will start a chapter on ``Salad the Sient
Killer'' by saying ``I love salad, eaten in moderation like bacon
or chocolate, about twice a week.'' He travels all over the world
in search of perfection, going to Sicily to find the best granita,
and devotes a whole chapter to the pursuit of the best French
fries. He doggedly pursues answers. (This is an obsessive guy who
loaded a saltshaker with 15 grams of salt, counted 330 shakes
before it was empty just to figure out the number of milligrams of
salt in each shake.)
</P>
<P>
   Each free-standing chapter is perfect for a summer read on the
porch swing. The eclectic mix of recipes, from American apple pie
and butterscotch nut ice cream to chocolate granita and grilled
eel, may or may not tempt you to cook, but eaters will savor the
chase.
</P>
<P>
   E Bruculinu, America, by Vincent Schiavelli (Houghton Mifflin
$24) is aptly subtitled Remembrances of Sicilian-American Brooklyn,
Told in Stories and Recipes.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to be Italian or have roots in Brooklyn to enjoy
peering through this window of life into the Italian ghetto of
Brooklyn at the beginning of this century. Raised in a house where
Grandfather did the cooking, Schiavelli writes of a world where the
families were Sicilian first, Brooklynites second and Americans
only a distant third. He writes of their rituals of life that give
meaning to the food, and the recipes. Chicken soup is not just
soup, it is the specific meal served to the family taking care of
children during a funeral service. Veal cutlets were the staple at
the Men's Club and fried fish the essentials of Christmas Eve in
Bruculinu . It is a book with soul.
</P>
<P>
   For a slightly different look on the world, pick up Mangia,
Little Italy! Secrets from a Sicilian Family Kitchen , by Francesca
Romina (Chronicle, $18.95 paperback), which is based in lower
Manhattan's Little Italy section, adjacent to Chinatown. Romina
also interweaves stories and family recipes.
</P>
<P>
   E Tender at the Bone, Growing Up at the Table, by Ruth Reichl
(Random House, $23) is story behind one woman's life that has been
and is defined by food. Reichl is the most powerful restaurant
critic in the country, writing for the New York Times . What she
writes about here is not that job, but a focus on food that began
at an early age. Most people who've read the book or the reviews
remember most vividly her childhood accounts of a ``culinarily
challenged mother who once gave an entire party food poisoning.''
</P>
<P>
   From my view, Reichl is the most talented writer among newspaper
food critics, so this is a good read. Just don't expect insights
into the restaurant or reviewing businesses. A few recipes are
scattered through the memoir, none of them her mother's.
</P>
<P>
   E The Perfect Recipe : Getting It Right Every Time, by Pam
Anderson ($27, Houghton-Mifflin) is a good choice for serious cooks
who have yet to subscribe to Cook's Illustrated magazine. Anderson
is is executive editor of the magazine known to foodies for its
exhaustive testing, revising and retesting of recipes, with
perfection in mind. Much of the material appeared in Cook's, where
they kitchen trials range from roasting 40 turkeys or 20 prime ribs
just to find the answers. Readers will find out why brining a
turkey produces the best Thanksgiving bird, and why the milk goes
in before the butter for perfect mashed potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   E Great Pies and Tarts, by Carole Walter (Potter, $35). Don't
just cut to the recipes. Even if you are confident of your
pie-baking skills, be sure to browse the first 100 pages of this
book, particularly the chapter devoted to technique.
</P>
<P>
   The tips alone from this respected cooking teacher are worth the
price of the book. Did you know that old eggs separate more easily
than fresh eggs? That cream close to the expiration date will whip
better than very fresh cream? That a sifter should never be washed?
That citrus zest that has been finely grated will be more pungent
than zest that has been minced?
</P>
<P>
   The first part of the book is fairly encyclopedic but then come
the recipes. The array of pastry recipes is tempting, from toasted
coconut pie pastry or pine nut pastry to cookie-and-nut crusts made
with everything from biscotti or amaretti to ginger snaps. Basics
such as apple and lemon meringue pie are included, but this teacher
stretches the pastry imagination to put a sweet risotto filling in
an almond crust. Very precise instructions make it easy for even a
novice to succeed with the recipes.
</P>
<P>
   E Born to Grill, An American Celebration by Cheryl Alters
Jamison and Bill Jamison (Harvard Common Press, $27.95) is the one
major grilling book of the season, and it's one of the best choices
if a collection of recipes is all you're after.
</P>
<P>
   Moving from the world of slow, wood-smoked barbecues in their
bestselling Smoke &AMP; Spice , the authors now explore the realm of
open fire grilling. Big flavors dominate the recipes in this book.
It's a good choice for a last minute gift for Father's Day. Maybe
he'll read it and have something new for the Fourth of July.

   Johnny-Light a well-seated idea
</P>
<P>
   By John Kelso
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Perhaps no one in America has sacrificed as much for
marital relations in America as Bill Bradford II, one of the
inventors of the Johnny-Light.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bradford, a resident of Burleson near Fort Worth,
gave up a $90,000-a-year job as an electrical engineer to market
the device.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnny-Light warns women in the middle of the night if some
bonehead has left the toilet seat up.
</P>
<P>
   An eerie greenish glow lets those approaching the toilet know
that if they just sit down, they're falling in. Bradford says he
was spurred to come up with the Johnny-Light concept by ``all those
Ann Landers columns coming out about women falling in, in the
middle of the night. Now if a lady sees this soft green light, she
knows not to sit down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Johnny-Light fits between the back of the toilet seat and
the hinge. ``It makes it look like it's part of the toilet,''
Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford is on a mission. ``What I want to do is replace the tie
as the No. 1 Father's Day gift, and by the grace of God, I'm going
to do it,'' the determined Bradford said. ``But it's also a great
stocking stuffer, and it's cheaper than a marriage counselor for
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford has a way to go before he reaches the top of the silly
gift heap. So far, it's been rough. In two years, Bradford has sold
only 7,500 Johnny-Lights .
</P>
<P>
   At $10 a pop, that's a far cry from the money he was making
before he quit his day job. To help make ends meet, he umpires Pony
League and high school baseball games. And I imagine it helps that
wife Barbara has a job as a mortgage loan officer.
</P>
<P>
   There have been marketing problems along the way. When a TV show
reported the Johnny-Light's toll-free phone number incorrectly _
it's really 1-888-566-5483, not 1-800-566-5483) _ people found
themselves calling a sex line, Bradford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It said, 'Hi there . . . Are you ready for a good time?' ''
Bradford recalled. ``Actually, it says, `Hi sexy, and thanks for
calling the Pleasure Club Hotline.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bradford remains optimistic that the Johnny-Light will
make him a healthy income one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about how many residential toilets there are in
America,'' said Bradford, who came up with the idea for the
Johnny-Light because he kept waking up Barbara in the middle of the
night by turning on the light to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want to do, as our packaging says _ 'Lighting the way to
family harmony.' It's real simple. That's our mission. I guess
that's my commitment statement, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradford figures he must be on the right track. He points out
that ever since he and his partners patented the Johnny-Light,
imitators have come along.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we received our patents, all these other people started
coming out with other things for the toilet,'' he said. ``The Beep
Seat _ if the toilet seat's left up for any amount of time, it
starts beeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the His and Hers Light, another competitor. ``What
this is is a red light/green light motion detector that fits on the
back of the toilet lid,'' Bradford explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk up to it, when the toilet seat's down, a red
light comes on. If you walk up to it and the toilet seat's up, a
green light comes on.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds too complicated for me.
</P>
<P>
   So it's getting pretty high tech in the toilet seat warning
contraption development wars.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Bradford says, no one has come up with a
Clapper-type John device that makes the seat flap up and down when
you put your hands together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you, though, I tried to visualize that in my mind,
because, believe me, that has been thought about,'' Bradford said.
``But then you're looking at the mechanical, OK?''

 &HT;    Commission grants cats right to remain at Bradley's house
 &HT;    By Mary Lou Pickel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Catherine Bradley, the ``cat lady'' of Palm
Beach, can feed wild cats now without pussy-footing around the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County Commission on Tuesday (June 16) approved a
new rule allowing people to care for wild cat colonies as long as
they register with the Animal Care and Control Division and follow
certain requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``God in his mercy has given me my day here,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules also require owners to keep non-sterilized tabbies
indoors or face a yet-to-be-determined fine. The county would only
enforce the rules if neighbors rat out a roaming cat to animal
control officers. First-time offenders can escape the fine if they
sterilize their cat within 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioners also modified the qualifications for a hobby
breeder.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, which will go into effect in about three months,
are part of an overhaul of the county's animal care and control
rules, which haven't been changed significantly in nine years.
Officials hope the new rules will cut down on pet overpopulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our approach to feral cats has basically been to trap them and
kill them,'' Animal Care and Control Director Dennis Moore said.
That hasn't worked well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who founded the nonprofit Palm Beach Cat Rescue 12
years ago, feeds wild cats on the island and says the new rules are
modeled after her program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know each face of my 300 animals,'' she said. The rules
require Bradley and other caregivers to sterilize and vaccinate
cats, promote adoption of kittens, tag their ears, plant micro-chip
identifiers in their bodies, and, if necessary, euthanize sick
cats. Bradley said donations to her charity will cover the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The rules aim to reduce ``puppy mills'' by tightening the
definition of hobby breeders _ those who breed cats and dogs on a
smaller and higher-quality scale than commercial breeders.
</P>
<P>
   Some breeders, many from the Jupiter-Tequesta Dog Club, balked
at the requirement that they take back dogs that have been abused,
because that requirement might put them over the legal limit of
keeping 10 dogs on their property. They would always take back a
dog that didn't work out, they said, because they are responsible.
</P>
<P>
   County Commission Chairman Burt Aaronson didn't approve of a
``lemon law'' for dogs and voted against the entire ordinance,
which passed 4-1, with Commissioners Ken Foster and Mary McCarty
absent.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Older women would grace the screen
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We live in an enlightened age, right? More women are running
companies, fighting fires, mending bones.
</P>
<P>
   So what's wrong with Hollywood? There women are given the boot
just about the time they develop the grace, wisdom and strength
that truly makes them attractive.
</P>
<P>
   As for the men, well, they're playing opposite co-stars almost
young enough to be their granddaughters, let alone their daughters:
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty, 61, and Halle Berry, 29. Michael Douglas, 53, and
Gwyneth Paltrow, 24. Harrison Ford, 55, and Anne Heche, 29. Robert
Redford, 60, and Kristin Scott-Thomas, 37. Jack Nicholson, 61, and
Helen Hunt, 35.
</P>
<P>
   To put all this in perspective, Halle Berry was born one year
after Beatty made Bonnie and Clyde. Hunt was born the year
Nicholson made his ninth film, The Raven. Paltrow was born the year
Douglas starred in the second season of The Streets of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   To put this in another perspective, the scandalous May-December
romance in 1967's The Graduate involved actors Dustin Hoffman, 30,
and Anne Bancroft, 36.
</P>
<P>
   Is Hollywood run by male studio executives, by any chance?
</P>
<P>
   Although we have recently been treated to a glut of movies
starring old leading men/young leading ladies, the phenomenon is
hardly new. In her 20s, Grace Kelly was wooed by everyone from Gary
Cooper to Cary Grant to Bing Crosby, all in their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-plus years and a women's liberation movement later, the
age gap is widening instead of narrowing. Clint Eastwood, 68,
prevailed against producers who considered Meryl Streep, 48, ``too
old'' to play opposite him in The Bridges of Madison County. (No
doubt they were looking for a 25-year-old frustrated middle-aged
housewife.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Hollywood will adopt an employment policy for actresses
the airline industry long ago abandoned for stewardesses: No one
over 35 need apply.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's abandonment of over-40 actresses may be cruel, but
it's the kind of discrimination that affects few of us in the job
market. It merely affects us in our souls.
</P>
<P>
   What does it say to us when there are so few screen images of
women over 40 in romantic roles? When we see much younger women
being romanced by men our fathers' age? When Ally McBeal,
metaphorically speaking, boots Murphy Brown and Cybill out of prime
time?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we're old enough and smart enough not to base any portion
of our self-worth on Hollywood. But in some undeveloped corner of
our psyche, these images are still powerful. And hurtful.
</P>
<P>
   The final straw came last week, when my husband and I rented a
forgettable romantic comedy, Till There Was You. Dylan McDermott
played a scene with his aged, gray-haired mother, who looked as if
she needed a walker to get off the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looks awfully familiar,'' Jim said, hitting rewind. She
was familiar. She was the beautiful Karen Allen of Animal House and
Raiders of the Lost Ark fame .
</P>
<P>
   Allen is 46, McDermott 35. Could be worse. Glenn Close, 51,
played the mother of Mel Gibson, 42 _ her Gertrude to his
Melancholy Dane _ in 1990's Hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic _ and maybe not accidental _ that women's roles in
the movies contract as our roles in the real world expand. We can
be CEOs and doctors, but we can't find the kind of strong-minded,
articulate roles Katharine Hepburn played in her '30s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   Better change my attitude, though, or I'll never make it in
Hollywood. Word has it I'm being considered for a plum role as Jack
Nicholson's maiden aunt.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently visited Coors Field in Denver and noticed a
striking similarity between it and Turner Field in Atlanta. Were
they designed by the same architect?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, but the look is indeed similar. The Kansas City
architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum designed Coors
Field, which opened April 26, 1995. The firm Ellerbe Becket of
Minneapolis designed Turner Field, which opened March 29, 1997.
Many people think Turner Field resembles Orioles Park at Camden
Yards in Baltimore, also designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum.
Camden Yards opened April 6, 1992, sparking renewed interest in
``retro'' baseball-only stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the group Zero Population Growth do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The organization's goal is obvious from its name: ``to slow
population growth and achieve a sustainable balance of people,
resources and the environment,'' as its mission statement says.
Founded in 1968, Zero Population Growth says its mission is based
on the premise that the finite resources of the world cannot
support an infinite number of people. Based in Washington, it has
more than 55,000 members and 20 chapters nationwide (none in
Georgia).
</P>
<P>
   The organization advocates a variety of measures to reduce
population pressures, including adoption of a national population
policy, access to contraceptives, reproductive choice, school-based
comprehensive sexuality education and health-care services, and
international support for voluntary family planning programs.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Zero Population Growth, 1400 16th St. N.W., Suite
320, Washington, DC 20036 (1-800-767-1956) a scanner are remote,
whether the caller is using digital or analog, said Jeff Battcher
of BellSouth Cellular. Analog is a very secure technology, he said,
but digital is even more secure.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is indeed different. The terminology, however, is
something only an engineer could love. Analog uses a continuously
variable electronic signal that varies in frequency over a radio
channel, Battcher explained. Digital transmission/switching
technologies employ a variety of discrete, distinct pulses to
represent information.
</P>
<P>
   Battcher pointed out that it's against the law _ ``an illegal
invasion of privacy'' _ for anyone to intentionally listen to
wireless telephone conversations. In addition, since 1994 it has
been illegal to sell or import scanners that will pick up wireless
telephone conversations. It also is illegal to modify scanners to
receive those conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the ozone problems in the atmosphere, would it
help if people drove without using their vehicle's air conditioner?
</P>
<P>
   A: That wouldn't do a thing for the atmosphere. All you'll
accomplish is being hot. An air conditioner doesn't put a
significant drain on your vehicle's engine, so ground-level
pollution isn't noticeably increased by turning it on. The only
advantage you'd gain is a slight increase in fuel economy. Although
that means a slight reduction in air pollution, because you're
using less gas, it's not significant. Better, perhaps, to car pool,
take public transportation, ride a bike or walk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently listed Major League players who hit four home
runs in a single game. Didn't Atlanta pitcher Tony Cloninger hit
four grand slams in a game in the late '60s or early '70s?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you're recalling is a pair of grand slams Cloninger hit
July 3, 1966, in a game at San Francisco, giving him 9 RBIs.
Although he didn't hit four home runs in that game, his feat
nevertheless set a National League record for a pitcher, said
Braves publicist Glen Serra. Cloninger also had hit two home runs
in his previous game, but the bases weren't loaded then.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Didn't Atlanta pitcher Tony Cloninger hit four grand
slams in a game in the late '60s or early '70s?
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do we know how the number 911 was chosen for a universal
emergency phone call, as compared to any other random three digits?
</P>
<P>
   A: In November 1967, officials of AT&AMP;T and the Federal
Communications Commission met to find a means of establishing a
universal emergency number that could be implemented quickly,
something done as early as 1937 in Britain, the first country to
establish such a number. The next year, AT&AMP;T announced that it
would establish the three digits 9-1-1 as the U.S. emergency code.
It was selected because it was brief, easily remembered and had
never been authorized as an official code, area code or service
code. It also met the long-range numbering plans and switching
configurations of the telephone industry. On Feb. 16, 1968, the
first 911call in the United States was successfuly placed in
Alabama. The serving company was Alabama Telephone Co., which later
became Contel Corp. That 911 system is still in use.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can just anybody have their ashes scattered over the Grand
Canyon, or is it restricted to dignitaries? It was reported
recently that the late former Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.) wanted
that done for himself. If anyone can do it, what is the procedure
for requesting permission?
</P>
<P>
   A: The spreading of ashes at the canyon is not restricted to
dignitaries. But a permit is required, according to park
spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge. Some 20-30 permits are requested and
issued each year. A person wanting to spread ashes there must apply
in writing for a permit, stating whose ashes are involved, who will
be at the canyon to spread them and the date. Permits normally are
granted so long as the location requested is not by a water source,
sacred or archaeological site or a public use area. The address:
Grand Canyon National Park, Special Use Permits Office, P.O. Box
129, Grand Canyon, AZ 86023. Information: 520-638-7841.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Canyon isn't the only national park that permits the
spreading of ashes. It was done recently in the Everglades for
environmentalist and writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas. Anyone
contemplating such a request should contact the individual park's
superintendent's office.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will you settle a bet? Was the late Rep. Sonny Bono
(R-Calif.) ever the mayor of Carmel, Calif.? If so, was that his
first public office? Also, was Clint Eastwood ever elected to any
office?
</P>
<P>
   A: Q&AMP;A hopes you bet that Dirty Harry . . . er, Eastwood, and
not Bono, was Carmel's mayor. Eastwood was elected to a two-year
term April 8, 1986; he declined to run for re-election in 1988.
Bono also was a mayor, but of Palm Springs, Calif. He was elected
to a four-year term in 1988, his first public office. In 1992, when
that stint ended, he ran for the U.S. Senate, but finished a weak
third in the Republican primary. Two years later, however, he was
elected to represent California's 44th District in Congress, and he
won re-election in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A said young men still are required to register with the
Selective Service. My son will turn 18 later this month. Where,
how, and within what time frame must he register?
</P>
<P>
   A: Men can register by completing a form available at any post
office. Some high schools also have a faculty or staff member who
serves as a Selective Service registrar. Registration is required
within 30 days of the person's 18th birthday. Failing to register
makes a person subject to prosecution and fine up to $250,000,
and/or imprisonment for up to five years. Registration also is
required to qualify for federal student aid and most federal
employment. Information: 1-847-688-6888; or, on the Internet,
www.sss.gov/ (registration also is possible on-line).

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: My son will turn 18 later this month. Where, how, and
within what time frame must he register for Selective Services?
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what year did our young men no longer have to register for
the draft?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. government stopped drafting males in 1973, but
registration with the Selective Service System continues for almost
all male U.S. citizens, and male non-citizens living in the United
States, who are 18 through 25. Something called the ``stand-by
draft'' was created by the government in 1973, but discontinued in
1975. In 1980, Congress passed legislation resuming registration
requirements for the draft. Men who would be classified as
conscientious objectors if they were drafted also must also
register. Registration provides the government with a list of men
who could be inducted into the armed services in the event of a
national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At one time, hurricanes were named after women only. When
were men's names included?
</P>
<P>
   A: The practice of naming hurricanes solely after women came to
an end in 1978 when men's names were included in the eastern North
Pacific storm lists. In 1979, male names were included in lists for
the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know hurricanes are given names, and sometimes some of
those names, such as Andrew, are retired. Why is that done? What
others have been retired?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hurricane names typically are retired, says the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and replaced with new ones
when a storm associated with a particular name causes great loss of
life or property damage. The countries most affected by such a
storm can make a recommendation to the World Meteorological
Organization that a name be retired, Frank Lepore of the National
Hurricane Center in Miami told Q&AMP;A. In Andrew's case, it was the
United States that recommended scrapping it, with Alex taking its
place, starting in 1998. NOAA said such retirement isn't
necessarily permanent; the name just can't be used again for at
least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   These Atlantic Ocean storm names have been retired: Agnes,
Alicia, Allen, Andrew, Anita, Audrey, Betsy, Beulah, Bob, Camille,
Carla, Carmen, Carol, Celia, Cleo, Connie, David, Diana, Diane,
Donna, Dora, Elena, Eloise, Flora, Frederic, Gilbert, Gloria,
Hattie, Hazel, Hilda, Hugo, Ione, Inez, Janet, Joan, Klaus, Luis,
Marilyn, Opal and Roxanne.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard recently that formaldehyde is used in the process to
decaffeinate coffee. I've also heard that it is used in processing
milk. Is that true? It sounds very bad to me.
</P>
<P>
   A: Formaldehyde is not used in the decaffeination process of
coffee, nor is it used in milk processing for human consumption,
said Chris Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic
Association. It's sometimes used as a preservative on farms when
testing milk samples for various components in the milk, she said,
but not for processing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If formaldehyde is not used in processing decaffeinated
coffee, what is?
</P>
<P>
   A: Decaffeination agents include carbon dioxide; ethyl acetate,
a substance that occurs naturally in many fruits; methylene
chloride, a solvent; fats and oils; and water, said Chris
Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. The
Food and Drug Administration has determined that methylene chloride
is safe for use in coffee decaffeination in up to 10 parts per
million, but the coffee industry's practice results in levels 100
times lower than this amount, she said. The decaffeination process
starts with softening the green, unroasted beans in the agents,
after which they're ``agitated'' to draw the caffeine away. Then
the beans are heated and blown with steam, followed by roasting.

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Q: If formaldehyde is not used in processing

</P>
<P>
   Q: Monica Lewinsky has hired a new team of defense attorneys who
have been described in news reports as ``top notch, well-connected
and experienced.'' Since she is an unemployed former White House
intern, who is paying her legal bills?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reports published when the new legal team was brought on
board said Washington attorneys Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris were
recruited and hired by the Lewinsky family. Lewinsky's parents are
divorced. Her father, Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, is a radiation
oncologist in Beverly Hills, Calif. He has said that he paid the
legal bills of his daughter's former lawyer, William Ginsburg.
Monica Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, is a New York writer. Well
before the change in attorneys, Dr. Lewinsky mounted a defense fund
to help defray his daughter's legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Newspaper articles have reported that about 20 states have
high school graduation tests or ``exit exams.'' Will you list them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Education Commission of the States lists these: Alabama,
Alaska (effective Jan. 1, 2002), Arkansas, Arizona, Florida,
Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana (unless principal certifies student has
met ``Core 40'' requirements), Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts
(must pass proficiencies, but not a single exit exam), Mississippi,
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico (to graduate with a diploma), New
York, North and South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Minnesota students graduating in 2000 must pass tests in
reading, math and writing to meet the requirements of the Minnesota
Graduation Rule. And Pennsylvania students must achieve 52 state
academic performance ``outcomes'' (assessments) plus locally
developed outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Exactly what is required for a baseball pitcher to be awarded
a win, besides, obviously, the team winning? Why do some relief
pitchers get the win?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winning pitcher _ the one given official credit for his
team's victory _ can be the starting pitcher or a reliever who
comes in with his team tied or behind and wins the game. A starting
pitcher must complete at least five full innings to be so credited.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jerry Lewis has been honored many times over the years for
his work with muscular dystrophy. Do you know why he became
involved with that cause?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many people speculate that the actor and comedian must have
known someone, perhaps a family member, who was stricken with a
neuromuscular disease, but Lewis has never disclosed a specific
reason for his interest and involvement, Jim Brown of the Muscular
Dystrophy Association in Phoenix told Q&AMP;A. ``We're just very
thankful he has been involved for more than four decades now,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewis has been volunteer national chairman of the
health agency for more than 40 years, it's his fund-raising
telethons each Labor Day that have kept him _ and muscular
dystrophy _ most in the public eye. These efforts have raised more
than $900 million for the search for treatments and cures for some
40 neuromuscular diseases. Lewis also makes personal appearances on
behalf of MDA that are never publicized. ``There probably has not
been a single day in the last 45 years on which Jerry has not met,
worked for, phoned or just talked about youngsters and adults
living with neuromuscular diseases, and MDA's effort in their
behalf,'' Brown said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently visited Coors Field in Denver and noticed a
striking similarity between it and Turner Field in Atlanta. Were
they designed by the same architect?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, but the look is indeed similar. The Kansas City
architectural firm Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum designed Coors
Field, which opened April 26, 1995. The firm Ellerbe Becket of
Minneapolis designed Turner Field, which opened March 29, 1997.
Many people think Turner Field resembles Orioles Park at Camden
Yards in Baltimore, also designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum.
Camden Yards opened April 6, 1992, sparking renewed interest in
``retro'' baseball-only stadiums.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does the group Zero Population Growth do?
</P>
<P>
   A: The organization's goal is obvious from its name: ``to slow
population growth and achieve a sustainable balance of people,
resources and the environment,'' as its mission statement says.
Founded in 1968, Zero Population Growth says its mission is based
on the premise that the finite resources of the world cannot
support an infinite number of people. Based in Washington, it has
more than 55,000 members and 20 chapters nationwide (none in
Georgia).
</P>
<P>
   The organization advocates a variety of measures to reduce
population pressures, including adoption of a national population
policy, access to contraceptives, reproductive choice, school-based
comprehensive sexuality education and health-care services, and
international support for voluntary family planning programs.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Zero Population Growth, 1400 16th St. N.W., Suite
320, Washington, DC 20036 (1-800-767-1956). Or on the Internet:

</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that conversations from a digital phone cannot be
picked up on scanners or other phones, as they can be from regular
cellular phones? If so, what's the difference in technology?
</P>
<P>
   A: The odds of a cellular telephone conversation being picked up
by a scanner are remote, whether the caller is using digital or
analog, said Jeff Battcher of BellSouth Cellular. Analog is a very
secure technology, he said, but digital is even more secure.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is indeed different. The terminology, however, is
something only an engineer could love. Analog uses a continuously
variable electronic signal that varies in frequency over a radio
channel, Battcher explained. Digital transmission/switching
technologies employ a variety of discrete, distinct pulses to
represent information.
</P>
<P>
   Battcher pointed out that it's against the law _ ``an illegal
invasion of privacy'' _ for anyone to intentionally listen to
wireless telephone conversations. In addition, since 1994 it has
been illegal to sell or import scanners that will pick up wireless
telephone conversations. It also is illegal to modify scanners to
receive those conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Considering the ozone problems in the atmosphere, would it
help if people drove without using their vehicle's air conditioner?
</P>
<P>
   A: That wouldn't do a thing for the atmosphere. All you'll
accomplish is being hot. An air conditioner doesn't put a
significant drain on your vehicle's engine, so ground-level
pollution isn't noticeably increased by turning it on. The only
advantage you'd gain is a slight increase in fuel economy. Although
that means a slight reduction in air pollution, because you're
using less gas, it's not significant. Better, perhaps, to car pool,
take public transportation, ride a bike or walk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently listed Major League players who hit four home
runs in a single game. Didn't Atlanta pitcher Tony Cloninger hit
four grand slams in a game in the late '60s or early '70s?
</P>
<P>
   A: What you're recalling is a pair of grand slams Cloninger hit
July 3, 1966, in a game at San Francisco, giving him 9 RBIs.
Although he didn't hit four home runs in that game, his feat
nevertheless set a National League record for a pitcher, said
Braves publicist Glen Serra. Cloninger also had hit two home runs
in his previous game, but the bases weren't loaded then.

 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the veritable haberdashery of hats worn with distinction by
Jules Feiffer _ cartoonist, screenwriter, playwright, novelist _ we
can now add one more: editor.
</P>
<P>
   Feiffer presided over the publication of the just-plain-terrific
July issue of  &UR; Civilization &LR; . It's must reading for connoisseurs of
comic strips and cartoons (or ``drawings,'' as the old New Yorker
would haughtily have it), or just anyone who remembers ``the Sunday
funnies'' as a high point of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Caniff, Walt Kelly, Roy Crane, Will Eisner, Stan Lee,
Harvey Kurtzman, Peter Arno, Winsor McCay, Bill Mauldin: The
immortals are all here, lovingly evoked in essays by a roster of
writers and cartoonists enlisted by guest editor Feiffer. There are
reproductions of such classic strips as McCay's ``Little Nemo in
Slumberland,'' a ``Laffline'' that traces 100 years of comic
milestones, and political cartoons from such contemporary masters
as Pat Oliphant.
</P>
<P>
   One can, of course, argue about the left-outs. I personally
would have loved to see full appraisals of three geniuses who get
short shrift: Garry Trudeau, Charles Schultz, and Matt Groening.
But the issue reflects Feiffer's own view of the most significant
figures in cartooning history (in which number he himself would be
counted), as well as his taste for the surreal and subversive, the
edgily political, the dark and ``underground.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he is without an appreciation for more mainstream fare.
Feiffer's own essay recalls his youth in New York, where the best
comic strips ran in the worst newspapers, fishwraps so bad his
parents wouldn't allow them in their apartment (so he stole the
super's papers). He recaptures the exhilaration he (and many other
youngsters of his and succeeding generations) felt while reading
action strips whose good guys ``broke out of the page to get at the
bad guy, punching through the framed borders of panels, leaping

   Speaking of bad guys:  &UR; Cartoon News &LR;  reprints a bunch of
political cartoons published after the Titanic sank in 1912.
British cartoonists tiptoed around the issue of responsbility, but
American cartoonists pulled no punches in assigning blame to the
greed and hubris of the Titanic's owners.
</P>
<P>
   But then cartoons have always been among the best mirrors of the
times. Consider this sketch in Cartoon News that tweaks Clinton
apologists: It shows a man running out of a bank with a gun and a
bag of money. ``Hey! That was Senator Truall!'' cries a man.
Replies his wife serenely: ``Well, what he does in his private life
shouldn't concern us.''

   Cheryl Della Pietra spent a few months back in 1992 as an
assistant to Hunter S. Thompson and lived to tell the tale in this
month's  &UR; P.O.V. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The godfather of gonzo journalism emerges as just the wild man
you'd expect. As described by Della Pietra, days and nights with
Hunter resembled life on the edge of a volcano; he is depicted as
an eruptive figure fueled by quantities of booze and drugs that
would kill others. ``At this point in his life, he'd probably croak
if he stopped,'' nonchalantly explains Della Pietra, who seems to
have a gonzo streak in her as well.
</P>
<P>
   Her job was to ``have Hunter's hands on the typewriter by 2
(a.m., that is),'' a task she likens to ``caging a wild animal and
slowly cornering it into submission.'' He much preferred to ``jump
in the hot tub with a whole key lime pie, a cell phone, a bottle of
Champagne and `Caligula' on in the background.''
</P>
<P>
   The extremes of Thompson's life eventually wore Della Pietra
out, so she left. But she seems to retain an affectionate regard
for ``this deranged man,'' an affection we can't quite understand
but do believe, somehow, after reading this account.

   When Dawn Steel became pregnant in the mid-1980s, she was pushed
out of her job as president of production at Paramount. But she
fought her way back to become president of Columbia Pictures in
1987, the first woman ever to head both the production and
marketing divisions of a Hollywood movie studio.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Dawn Steel knew a thing or two about swimming with the
sharks. But how much did she know about movies? Producer David
Madden recalls the time Steel, then at Paramount, gestured toward a
pile of videotapes and told him: ``These are movies somebody told
me I should see. Do you think I should see any of these?'' In the
pile were such Cinema 101 classics as ``The Maltese Falcon'' and
``All About Eve.''
</P>
<P>
   Madden's reminiscence is part of an absorbing, shadows-and-light
portrait of Steel, who died six months ago of a brain tumor at age
51, in the current issue of  &UR; Premiere &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In recollections by friends, enemies, and colleagues, it becomes
clear that Steel could be a shark herself, with a habit of berating
producers and other underlings that earned her the sobriquet ``the
Queen of Mean.'' But she also respected those who stood up to her,
and once she'd made it up the greasy pole herself, was willing to
help other women executives looking to make it in an often-hostile
Hollywood.

   The old Mount Everest ``because it's there'' attitude toward
grueling expeditions has always struck me as a bit harebrained. I'm
more inclined to the view expressed by a character in Anne Tyler's
``The Accidental Tourist'' to the effect that ``the passage of time
should be adventure enough for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, I greatly enjoyed Todd Balf's acount in  &UR; Men's
Journal  &LR; of pedaling the new Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, a
2,468-mile off-road bike path. Even though he subjects himself to a
risky ordeal in remote places _ valleys, deserts, dirt roads,
tall-timber country _ Balf offers an engagingly anti-heroic,
self-deprecating take on the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   After three days during which he does not see a single other
soul, he confesses only half-jokingly, ``I want my blankey.'' To
keep grizzly bears away, he admits, he sings ``John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt'' as he bicycles up and down mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
   Charming as Balf's account is, though, I was still left
wondering: What's the point? Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to
make the arduous trek to the company cafeteria, fighting through
any and all obstacles, to get a piece of pie. Why? Because it's
there.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: My son will turn 18 later this month. Where, how, and
within what time frame must he register for Selective Services?
</P>
<P>
   Q: In what year did our young men no longer have to register for
the draft?
</P>
<P>
   A: The U.S. government stopped drafting males in 1973, but
registration with the Selective Service System continues for almost
all male U.S. citizens, and male non-citizens living in the United
States, who are 18 through 25. Something called the ``stand-by
draft'' was created by the government in 1973, but discontinued in
1975. In 1980, Congress passed legislation resuming registration
requirements for the draft. Men who would be classified as
conscientious objectors if they were drafted also must also
register. Registration provides the government with a list of men
who could be inducted into the armed services in the event of a
national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At one time, hurricanes were named after women only. When
were men's names included?
</P>
<P>
   A: The practice of naming hurricanes solely after women came to
an end in 1978 when men's names were included in the eastern North
Pacific storm lists. In 1979, male names were included in lists for
the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know hurricanes are given names, and sometimes some of
those names, such as Andrew, are retired. Why is that done? What
others have been retired?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hurricane names typically are retired, says the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and replaced with new ones
when a storm associated with a particular name causes great loss of
life or property damage. The countries most affected by such a
storm can make a recommendation to the World Meteorological
Organization that a name be retired, Frank Lepore of the National
Hurricane Center in Miami told Q&AMP;A. In Andrew's case, it was the
United States that recommended scrapping it, with Alex taking its
place, starting in 1998. NOAA said such retirement isn't
necessarily permanent; the name just can't be used again for at
least 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   These Atlantic Ocean storm names have been retired: Agnes,
Alicia, Allen, Andrew, Anita, Audrey, Betsy, Beulah, Bob, Camille,
Carla, Carmen, Carol, Celia, Cleo, Connie, David, Diana, Diane,
Donna, Dora, Elena, Eloise, Flora, Frederic, Gilbert, Gloria,
Hattie, Hazel, Hilda, Hugo, Ione, Inez, Janet, Joan, Klaus, Luis,
Marilyn, Opal and Roxanne.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard recently that formaldehyde is used in the process to
decaffeinate coffee. I've also heard that it is used in processing
milk. Is that true? It sounds very bad to me.
</P>
<P>
   A: Formaldehyde is not used in the decaffeination process of
coffee, nor is it used in milk processing for human consumption,
said Chris Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic
Association. It's sometimes used as a preservative on farms when
testing milk samples for various components in the milk, she said,
but not for processing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If formaldehyde is not used in processing decaffeinated
coffee, what is?
</P>
<P>
   A: Decaffeination agents include carbon dioxide; ethyl acetate,
a substance that occurs naturally in many fruits; methylene
chloride, a solvent; fats and oils; and water, said Chris
Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. The
Food and Drug Administration has determined that methylene chloride
is safe for use in coffee decaffeination in up to 10 parts per
million, but the coffee industry's practice results in levels 100
times lower than this amount, she said. The decaffeination process
starts with softening the green, unroasted beans in the agents,
after which they're ``agitated'' to draw the caffeine away. Then
the beans are heated and blown with steam, followed by roasting.

</P>
<P>
   Q: Monica Lewinsky has hired a new team of defense attorneys who
have been described in news reports as ``top notch, well-connected
and experienced.'' Since she is an unemployed former White House
intern, who is paying her legal bills?
</P>
<P>
   A: Reports published when the new legal team was brought on
board said Washington attorneys Jacob Stein and Plato Cacheris were
recruited and hired by the Lewinsky family. Lewinsky's parents are
divorced. Her father, Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, is a radiation
oncologist in Beverly Hills, Calif. He has said that he paid the
legal bills of his daughter's former lawyer, William Ginsburg.
Monica Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis, is a New York writer. Well
before the change in attorneys, Dr. Lewinsky mounted a defense fund
to help defray his daughter's legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Newspaper articles have reported that about 20 states have
high school graduation tests or ``exit exams.'' Will you list them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Education Commission of the States lists these: Alabama,
Alaska (effective Jan. 1, 2002), Arkansas, Arizona, Florida,
Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana (unless principal certifies student has
met ``Core 40'' requirements), Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts
(must pass proficiencies, but not a single exit exam), Mississippi,
Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico (to graduate with a diploma), New
York, North and South Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Others: Minnesota students graduating in 2000 must pass tests in
reading, math and writing to meet the requirements of the Minnesota
Graduation Rule. And Pennsylvania students must achieve 52 state
academic performance ``outcomes'' (assessments) plus locally
developed outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Exactly what is required for a baseball pitcher to be awarded
a win, besides, obviously, the team winning? Why do some relief
pitchers get the win?
</P>
<P>
   A: The winning pitcher _ the one given official credit for his
team's victory _ can be the starting pitcher or a reliever who
comes in with his team tied or behind and wins the game. A starting
pitcher must complete at least five full innings to be so credited.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Jerry Lewis has been honored many times over the years for
his work with muscular dystrophy. Do you know why he became
involved with that cause?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many people speculate that the actor and comedian must have
known someone, perhaps a family member, who was stricken with a
neuromuscular disease, but Lewis has never disclosed a specific
reason for his interest and involvement, Jim Brown of the Muscular
Dystrophy Association in Phoenix told Q&AMP;A. ``We're just very
thankful he has been involved for more than four decades now,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lewis has been volunteer national chairman of the
health agency for more than 40 years, it's his fund-raising
telethons each Labor Day that have kept him _ and muscular
dystrophy _ most in the public eye. These efforts have raised more
than $900 million for the search for treatments and cures for some
40 neuromuscular diseases. Lewis also makes personal appearances on
behalf of MDA that are never publicized. ``There probably has not
been a single day in the last 45 years on which Jerry has not met,
worked for, phoned or just talked about youngsters and adults
living with neuromuscular diseases, and MDA's effort in their
behalf,'' Brown said.

 &HT;    Forget New York, my tiny world has worries enough
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There are currently 7,380,906 people in
New York City, and I know this because I recently visited there and
spent my entire 96 or so hours _ no, no, not seeing ``Les Miz''
(that's what they call it up there) or visiting that much
talked-about Ellis Island. I spent my four days in true midwestern
form:
</P>
<P>
   Worrying about every single person I saw.
</P>
<P>
   All right already. My husband is after me to stop exaggerating,
so I have to confess. A few people up there do seem to be doing OK.
They live in this cool area called, what is it again? Oh yeah, the
Upper East Side, and I know they're fine because they can afford to
pay big rents and buy shoes with real leather uppers. Plus, a few
of them actually looked happy.
</P>
<P>
   There is much awe in my heart for the hardy souls of New York
City who each morning rise and shine. They have bosses and kids and
lunches to pack. They have places to go and people to meet. They
have lives, all 7 million of them. But, good grief, the obstacles
that stand in their way at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded subways. Litter on the street. Gross-looking public
schools. If friends from college ever dare to visit, the
three-night hotel bill looks like a mortgage payment. And the smell
that floats up from those sidewalk grates. Good heavens! Why can't
that Rudy Giuliani guy leave the taxi drivers alone and do
something about that?
</P>
<P>
   Simmer down, says a man I work with, a man who actually _ are
you ready for this? _ grew up in New York City. If I lived up there
I wouldn't notice all this stuff. Yes, yes, he says. It is dirty
and people do seem a little distracted and, of course no one
establishes eye contact or smiles and says hello. That's because _
and he explained this oh-so-well that I wish I could remember it
word for word. It's because the people in New York City have
culture. And, from what I can gather, access to Connecticut on the
weekends doesn't hurt any either.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway shows. Great museums. Good Chinese restaurants. And,
this is my favorite part, you can walk to everything! What that
means, I guess, is that if you want to, you can walk to the Upper
East Side and touch a real tree.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not one to make rash decisions. I'm even trying to give
those men in the Southern Baptist church another chance, although
they'd better damn well hurry up. But I must tell you, I am not
made to survive in a city where everyone looks as though they need
a hug.
</P>
<P>
   We have a joke in our house, which _ as it turns out _ is no
joke at all. It's about the size of My World. My World, you see, is
small. The grocery store is a mile to the south. My kid's school is
2 miles to the east. The video store is right down from the grocery
store. The post office is in between the two. And the newspaper
office is smack in the middle. Every once in a while I do venture 4
or 5 miles outside this world to visit a good friend who has the
gall to reside outside my boundaries. But I like her, and her
children and husband are nice, so it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Inside this world are just enough worries to keep me going. The
odd homeless woman who wears layers of wool in the summer heat. The
girls around the corner whose mothers let them roam the
neighborhood freely. Why, just six months or so ago my best
friend's car was stolen right out of their driveway!
</P>
<P>
   So, let that Giuliani fellow worry about all those folks up in
New York City, the ones who need a hug and a smile and a weekend in
the country. I've got enough to keep me going right here. And
that's no exaggeration.

   Judge sides with cleaning Barton pool
</P>
<P>
   By Laylan Copelin
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks, mixing rhyme and
reason, kept the Barton Springs Pool open by denying attempts to
stop the city from cleaning the spring-fed pool that is habitat to
an endangered salamander and a cool respite for Central Texans.
</P>
<P>
   In a 16-line poem and a 20-page opinion, the judge took literary
and legal swings at the Endangered Species Act, ruling that the
city's cleaning does not harm the 3-inch salamander, which lives
only in the local springs. Sparks denied a temporary injunction to
halt the cleanings. However, the judge also warned of the federal
law's being taken to the extreme:
</P>
<P>
   ``Therefore, today, Austin's citizens get away with a rhyme.
But, the truth is, they might not be so lucky next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kirk Watson praised the decision, saying, ``Sometimes
justice is poetic.''
</P>
<P>
   While the legal victory keeps open what the judge _ an Austin
native and a competitive swimmer in his youth _ called an Austin
shrine, city officials must still get the approval of the U.S. Fish
&AMP; Wildlife Service to resume the cleanings. Officials say the
cleanings are necessary for the pool's safe operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent is to keep the pool open,'' said David Frederick,
the federal agency's Central Texas supervisor. ``Barton Springs is
a jewel for the city and unique in that thousands of people are
enjoying a habitat with an endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency is negotiating new cleaning methods with
Austin officials, and a decision could be coming within a couple of
days. Both city and federal officials expect the cleaning methods
to prompt changes to the appearance and operation of the pool. For
example, a berm or dam may be built to separate the shallow and
deep ends.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's decision, the city officials were only
concerned about the buildup of algae in the shallow end of the
pool. It has not been cleaned since May 21, the day before the
lawsuit was filed. In the summer, it is usually cleaned weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The algae are making the shallow end slippery. By this weekend,
city officials may close that section to waders until it can be
cleared. The deep end is expected to stay open because the water
remains clear enough for lifeguards to watch swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the city's legal standing was less clear.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hamilton and Robert Barnhart, two Central Texans whose
avocation is the study of salamanders, sued the city, claiming the
pool cleanings harmed the amphibian and the city had the wrong
permit to continue the water maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Neither returned phone calls, but their lawyer, Robert Kleeman,
said, ``We're disappointed.'' He insisted the lawsuit was about
saving the salamander and its habitat _ not harassing city
officials and advocates fighting development in the Barton Creek
watershed.
</P>
<P>
   The city had cleaned the pool for decades with methods much
harsher than it is using now, but in May 1997 the salamander was
declared an endangered species. Still, the city continued the
cleanings until January, when a salamander was found stranded after
city workers, in their usual practice, lowered the water to clean
the pool.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted the lawsuit. Under federal law, an endangered
species cannot be harassed, harmed, pursued, hunted, shot, killed,
trapped or captured. The law allows two exceptions: a permit either
for the ``incidental take'' _ or harm _ of the species as part of
the overall management of the pool or a special scientific permit.
</P>
<P>
   The city has applied for the first permit, but it cannot be
granted until this fall after a round of public hearings. In the
interim, the federal officials authorized ``experimental
cleanings'' under a scientific permit. Attorneys for Hamilton and
Barnhart argued that it was the wrong permit and served only as a
convenient stopgap.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks disagreed, saying city and federal officials learned more
about the salamander and its habitat with the carefully watched
cleanings. He agreed that salamanders are sometimes stranded on
land when the pool water is lowered for the cleanings. However,
city and federal biologists scour the exposed pool surface to
return the amphibians to deep water.
</P>
<P>
   The salamander, the judge noted, lives carefree in Barton
springs, ``with millions of dollars and thousands of people
scrambling to assist in their stress-free living and procreation.''
Meanwhile, Sparks wrote that Congress passed the Endangered Species
Act that once blocked the completion of a $100 million dam to save
the habitat of the snail darter, a 3-inch-long perch. ``Therefore,
it is not clear who has the smaller brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than lowering the pool water, Sparks said he found no
other parts of the city's cleaning process that affect the
salamander, and he concluded: ``There was simply no evidence
offered at the (June 3) hearing suggesting this is a case where the
'continued existence' of the salamander or the destruction of the
habitat is at issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ruling, the cleaning methods are likely to change
because of what biologists learned from the experimental cleanings.
</P>
<P>
   City and federal officials are considering building a berm or
dam to separate the shallow and deep ends. Because the shallow end
has a limestone bottom, it is not salamander habitat. By separating
the two portions of the pool, the shallow end could be cleaned more
often without dropping the water level of the rest of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities also are considering digging away more of what
is known as the Beach area. Despite the name, the area is covered
by 3 or 4 feet of water. If the pool is made deeper there,
Frederick said, swimmers would be less likely to step on the
salamanders and the amphibians would not be stranded if the water
level had to be lowered in that portion of the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Kleeman said his clients could support building the berm but not
digging out the Beach area because they consider that a developing
habitat for the salamander. He did not predict what, if anything,
his clients might do as the city continues to seek its final
federal permit to manage the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bunch, a lawyer for the Save Our Springs Alliance, praised
the effect of the judge's decision but was disappointed with his
criticism of the law protecting the species: ``We disagree that the
Act makes no sense. We agree with the judge that the real threat is
development upstream.''

 &HT;    PICTURE-PERFECT TOWN OFFERS ARCHITECTURE TO INSPIRE AN ARTIST
 &HT;    By CHERYL BLACKERBY
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEASIDE, Fla. _ So what do people do in this Architectural
Digest-perfect town? One would think the Gulf of Mexico would be
the main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   No, indeed. Houses are what draw sightseers, many of whom are
architects and urban planners, who come here to admire and
photograph the real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the town's 300 houses, designed by cutting-edge
architects from around the country, have been featured in
Metropolitan Home and Architectural Digest numerous times, so
numerous that city fathers have stopped keeping track.
</P>
<P>
   The town's signature tin roofs and storybook turrets make a
picture-perfect skyline. Not that every house has Victorian
inspiration. One home has red columns, copies of Greek ruins in
Crete, and others have industrial and modernist influences with
corrugated metal walls.
</P>
<P>
   Colors range from watercolor pastels (near the shore) to cobalt
blue and intense purple (near the woods). Color combinations are
fit for an artist. A house might have a blue door, green shutters
and flamingo pink clapboard walls.
</P>
<P>
   While most visitors end up on the beach, most of the
picture-snapping is done in town.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are so interested in the architecture and designs that
the town's only rental agency has started a ``Seaside Sampler,''
which allows guests to stay in a variety of cottages during a week
or more.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the ``cottages,'' some of which could house
a party of 12 or more if you included the guest houses in back, are
second homes and are rented out when owners aren't in town. Only
about 30 families live here year-round.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to tell the early houses from new ones. The
first clapboard house went up on 70 acres of wind-swept white sand
covered with palmettos and scrub pines. One by one, design-savvy
and wealthy people bought lots and hired architects, who created
houses that would conform to the town's demanding building codes.
</P>
<P>
   Seaside was the vision of Harvard-educated developer Robert
Davis, who inherited the land from his grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Alabama and didn't want a development of high-rise
condominiums like those that were springing up on other parts of
Florida's Gulf Coast. He imagined a community with ``the simple
genius of a small town.''
</P>
<P>
   He enlisted the help of Miami architects Andres Duany and
Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. They traveled throughout the South with
cameras, sketch pads and tape measures studying what Davis calls
``Southern vernacular'' architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at a coffee shop at Seaside's outdoor market, Davis
laughed at the idea of the Ivy League architects researching what
he calls cracker houses. ``We didn't study that in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaside's houses are the result of that research. The houses are
climate-friendly. They are built off the ground so air can
circulate underneath. They have peaked tin roofs, front porches,
side screened porches, and no grass lawns, which would require
fertilizers and pesticides. Landscaping is a jungle of native
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The houses are also people-friendly. They have tiny front yards
so that people on the front porch can chat with neighbors on the
sidewalk. Common greens and swimming pools encourage residents to
socialize. The tallest buildings are only four stories.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is a full-time resident, and his large two-story house is
often a gathering place for neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   You, too, can join the community, at least for a few days. In
Seaside, you can stay in cottages with names like Dreamsicle,
Starry Night and Sunnyside Up. It's a chance to live your fantasy
of a small town _ the one you grew up in, or the one you wish you
had grown up in.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: No one sweats here _ they glow in the perfect
surroundings of Seaside. It's perfect for the over-stressed who
want serious relaxation. There's not much to do that overtaxes _
just biking, walking and swimming in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants: There are plenty of cafes for lunch in the outdoor
market by the beach _ gourmet pizza, Greek specialties, hamburgers,
delis. The best restaurant for dinner (also open for lunch) is Bud
and Alley's by the beach. Fresh fish is the main attraction and
reservations are a must. Dress is casual, by way of Calvin Klein.
The elegant dining room at Josephine's French Country Inn is open
Friday and Saturday nights. Shades in the town center is a casual
restaurant that's perfect for kids.
</P>
<P>
   Organized fun: Yoga classes are held in the park; there's a big
fitness center, and several pools. Anyone for croquet? You can
borrow a mallet and try your luck on the green. Wear white.
</P>
<P>
   Cottage reservations: Call the Seaside Cottage Rental Agency,
(800) 277-8696 or www.seasidefl.com
</P>
<P>
   Rates: Get out the American Express gold card. Accommodations
vary quite a bit, but all are expensive. Dreamland Heights and 25
Central Square Penthouses, apartments built above galleries and
shops, range from $240 to $320 per night. Ruskin Place Townhomes in
the Ruskin Place Artist Colony are $425 per night.
</P>
<P>

motel, has rooms for $145 per night.
</P>
<P>
   Seaside Classic Cottages start at $375, and See Forever, (cq) a
spectacular beach house, rents for $850 per night.

 &HT;    IS THIS A REAL TOWN OR A MOVIE SET? YOU DECIDE
 &HT;    By CHERYL BLACKERBY
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEASIDE, Fla. _ This small town built next to the Gulf of Mexico
gives contradictory first impressions.
</P>
<P>
   You see a Victorian village with turn-of-the-century turrets,
verandas and picket fences. But on closer inspection it looks like
a movie set too perfect to be a real town.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Seaside, which was the location for the new movie The
Truman Show starring Jim Carrey, is not historic, unless 17 years _
the first house was built in 1981 _ counts as vintage.
</P>
<P>
   The houses and landscaping are uniformly flawless _ no
dilapidated buildings, no peeling paint, no weeds poking through
fences. Try to find that in a real town.
</P>
<P>
   But Seaside does have some very real Victorian attributes. Live
oaks shade wide streets. Parks with sweeping green lawns invite a
blanket and a book. And stores and a grocery are within easy
walking distance of every house.
</P>
<P>
   After a stay here, you leave town with this impression: Seaside
feels like Provincetown or Martha's Vineyard if those towns were
brand new and all the people who stayed there were tourists.

 &HT;    Academic camps encourage youths to pursue careers
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi and Pamela Coleman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Amanda Mendez peered into a microscope, hot on the
trail of an elusive paramecium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found some, but they kept swimming off,'' said the
15-year-old, as she adjusted a slide that held a drop of pond water
_ one of many activities at the Operation Achievement GTE Math and
Science Camp at Southwestern University.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez is one of thousands of Central Texas youth spending the
summers honing thinking skills at academic camps.
</P>
<P>
   Forget canoeing and horseback riding. These camps, ranging in
cost from free to about $300 a week, expose kids to everything from
engineering and science to poetry and architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mendez and about 30 other 11- to-15-year-olds spent last week
boning up on their math and science skills as part of the five-day
camp that ended with a trip to NASA, the Houston space center. The
camp was sponsored by a $30,000 grant from GTE.
</P>
<P>
   One of the camp assignments: collect bacteria samples from door
knobs, drinking fountain spouts and underneath fingernails. The
results surprised some of the students, who didn't expect to find
so much fuzzy gray and white evidence of microbes living among
them. Southwestern professor Vicente Villa said he hopes the camp
inspires the kids to pursue careers in science.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole philosophy is if they can discover this world and
fall in love with it, I can tell them about courses they need to
take to prepare for a career in science,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Texas, campers learned to do everything
from playing the violin to using mechanical engineering to build
cool stuff.
</P>
<P>
   This week, about 32 soon-to-be seventh- and eighth-grade girls
are getting an introduction to mechanical engineering. The weeklong
camp, sponsored by Careers in Engineering for Women at UT, requires
them to build a ball-tossing machine with their newfound know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, during what organizers refer to as ``Tool Time,''
Audrey Fuhrer, 11, leaned over an electric drill press, boring a
hole into a two-by-four _ part of what will eventually be the base
of her ball-tossing machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun, definitely fun,'' said Fuhrer, pushing up her safety
goggles and smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong camp is free, sponsored by 10 corporations,
including Advanced Micro Devices, 3M and Motorola. Every year,
students apply from schools across Texas. A panel of UT professors
and students selects the most enthusiastic students.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Turner, a teacher from Beckendorf Intermediate School near
Houston who accompanied students to the camp, said the camp
encourages girls to think about engineering for a career and keeps
young minds active.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning so much about teamwork and problem-solving _
it's just wonderful,'' said Turner, raising her voice over the
pounding hammers.
</P>
<P>
   In San Marcos, Southwest Texas State University professor Tom
Grimes leads seminars on creative and journal writing as part of
Project Pass, a program geared toward ninth-graders that teaches a
range of subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping that our participation will demystify college for
these kids,'' Grimes said, since the ultimate goal of the project
is that students graduate and go to college.
</P>
<P>
   At Austin Community College's Riverside campus on Grove
Boulevard, BritneyTurner, 12, bounds between buildings, discovering
how to dye T-shirts, weld key chains, make a birdhouse, change oil
and write a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this camp because it teaches you things,'' said Turner,
who wore a helmet that shielded her eyes while welding. ``Here in
camp, I just made a key chain. It takes a lot of hard work because
you have to listen and pay attention. It's not so easy to do at
first.''
</P>
<P>
   ACC instructors teach the workshops at the Summer Youth Academy,
which is free to its 35 participants, thanks to a $10,000 grant
from AMD. This year's two-week camp ends Saturday with a fair
exhibiting the work of the campers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great opportunity for these kids,'' said Guillermo
Ramirez, an ACC student who works as a group leader for the camp.
``It's a great place for children to get that experience they don't
necessarily get at their schools. It gives them a richer life and a
richer summer experience.''
</P>
<P>
   American-Statesman staff writers Pam Coleman, Nicole Monroe and
Rebecca Rodriguez contributed to this report.

 &HT;    On the streets, God's word is her shield
 &HT;    By Ian Trontz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVIERA BEACH _ On a recent evening, police Officer Garry Wilson
again saw the Rev. Lessye Charlow walking with her crucifix down
West 33rd Street, and he cringed a little.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't scorn Christ or Charlow. It's the other
streetcrawlers that worry him.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what drives us crazy,'' Wilson said. ``I know what
she's doing is very admirable. It's just a bad element she's
dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year ago, after a prophetic vision, Charlow set out to
drive the drug trade from her street.
</P>
<P>
   A minister for 45 years, she knows only one way how. Several
evenings a week, she wields a second-hand crucifix and a
personalized Bible, with the Red Sea miracle flagged by a yellow
Post-It note, and marches down the middle of West 33rd, filling
dealers and admirers alike with dread.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the weapons that God gave to me,'' she said. ``This
crucifix is my police. This Bible is my police. God anointed me
into the ministry and put all these fallen black men under me and
told me I had to bring 'em up.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlow, a cherubic-looking 78, surrounds herself with redeemed
castoffs. The robe and crucifix came from thrift stores. The ferns
and crotons around her small, prim evangelist church grew from
clippings she found on Singer Island curbs.
</P>
<P>
   Her holly trees are the only ones around with Spanish moss. She
brings the moss home from Cairo, Ga., where she grew up with her
cousin, Jackie Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   She's only 5-foot-3, so the moss doesn't go too high.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, on the corner of Avenue M, the empty lot has
native weeds and forgotten trash and a scraggly pine. The tree
gives enough shade for the young men who sit beneath it on
overturned paint pails and concrete blocks, waiting for cars to
stop.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Charlow confronted one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him how handsome he was and how he was throwing his
life away,'' she said she told the man.
</P>
<P>
   He answered by pulling a handgun from his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that's dangerous,'' Charlow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 18 years old,'' he shot back. ``I'm old enough to have a
gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he did what most everyone else does. He walked away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It scared me a little,'' she admitted. She told her small
congregation about it the following Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `If she was to get shot, she'd wake up in the arms
of Jesus,'''' said Willie Williams, one of her deacons. ``I really
don't want her out there, but I can't stop her. She's going to do
what God says she has to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a mission requires a visionary, and Charlow is a literal
one. Her adolescent dreams were not of wealth, a handsome husband
or even a happy family. Instead, she said, she had bedside glimpses
of herself nailed to a cross, or floating above trees, or standing
above crowds.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to West Palm Beach as a teenage bride, following her
first husband's search for better work. She divorced him, sold
clothes on Clematis Street for a few years, then married a local
school administrator in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, western Riviera Beach had dirt roads and few homes;
urbane West Palm Beach folks called it ``the woods.'' But God had
blueprints, and Charlow said he revealed them one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to come to Riviera and buy all the land you can
buy, because it will be a great city some day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then another husky voice boomed down on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you come with another dream!'' her husband said.
</P>
<P>
   She was ordained in 1953 and divorced again, childless, in 1954.
Her husband shuddered when she put on her robe; he couldn't accept
her as a minister, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could any of the male-run churches, so she started Faith
Holy Temple Evangelist Church on Tamarind Avenue. In 1959, she
moved the church to West 33rd Street, next door to her house, where
it stands today.
</P>
<P>
   Each Sunday, a congregation of about 20 gives enough money to
pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   Charlow said she draws no salary from the church. She supports
herself by babysitting, caring for homebound seniors and cleaning
the offices of a local extermination company.
</P>
<P>
   Then she drives her white 1990 Cadillac back to West 33rd. The
car carries only two items: a golf club she uses to hit balls on a
nearby field for exercise, and a 3-foot-high octagonal sign that
reads, ``STOP The Drugs SAVE The Children.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, 6/11 as on most afternoons, she leaned the sign
against the corner pine tree. A man with a striped polo shirt, whom
she said was a drug dealer, walked away, joining a group of men and
boys across the street.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 minutes, the black-robed Charlow posed like a statue of
sanctity. She glared at the men, with Exodus under one arm and the
18-inch crucifix raised high in the other. Her Christ has a few
more scrapes than He started with. But as far as Charlow's
concerned, it works just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's hand is what gives me strength,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has another guardian too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stresses me out,'' said Officer Wilson, who had spotted
Charlow and parked down the block to keep watch. ``She has no fear,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   The men avoided looking directly at her. After a few minutes,
they scattered like bugs exposed to light. Charlow walked up and
down the street for a few minutes, collected her sign and returned
to her sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug trade moves just a few blocks away, police Lt. Boone
Darden Jr. said, then Charlow has done something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they relocate, it takes time for their customers to
find them,'' he said. ``If you keep moving 'em, they start losing
sales.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't happened yet. Half an hour after Charlow left the
corner Thursday, the men were back, committing commerce through car
windows.
</P>
<P>
   Charlow has seen a better ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``God told me they're coming to be saved,'' she said. ``I had a
vision that they was coming down the street, in a line. They was
dropping them drugs in a tub and coming in the church to PRAISE
GOD!''
</P>

 &HT;    A FAMILY MAKES ITS WAY DOWN UPON THE SUWANNEE RIVER
 &HT;    By SHERMAN ZENT
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUWANNEE, Fla. _ My eyes squint against a soft breeze and a
brilliant sun as the houseboat drifts down the River Seine, French
countryside floating idly past on either side. There's a gentle
nudge. Aaaaah, must be my bikini-clad companion with that glass of
chardonnay . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad . . . daddy, can we fish now?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm on the Suwannee, not the Seine, and the nudge is from my
7-year-old son. The houseboat, however, is real and we're cruising
lazily up the river immortalized in Stephen Foster's song Old Folks
at Home, a perfect place to remember old daydreams.
</P>
<P>
   Our cruise begins at Miller's Marina in the town of Suwannee,
where the river empties into the gulf on Florida's West Coast. The
lower area of the river is a national wildlife refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's, started 27 years ago by Bill Miller, is a rustic fish
camp and marina. Three of his six sons help him run the business.
</P>
<P>
   The marina's mechanic explains the boat's operation for us. Turn
the key, push the throttle and you're a captain of the Suwannee. A
generator, separate from the engine, powers the air-conditioning,
heat, lights, microwave and full-sized refrigerator. A propane tank
fuels the oven and three-burner stove top. The boat is spacious,
but not luxurious. There is dark wood paneling and a faint musty
smell.
</P>
<P>
   A full-size bed and another full-size upper and lower bunk make
comfortable sleeping space for six. A hide-a-bed love seat makes
room for two more, but the sagging specimen of furniture does not
look inviting. Eight people on this boat would feel like a crowd
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic steers us away from the dock, jumps in a skiff, and
we're on our own, a battered aluminum canoe in tow.
</P>
<P>
   My kids quickly find a bell on the bow of the boat, and take
turns clanging until we can't take it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Every little gust of wind, change in current, or wake from
another boat nudges the nose one way or another, and staying on
course takes some concentration. Frequent over-correcting is a
given as you steer the lumbering boat, but the river is wide and
our speed is slow.
</P>
<P>
   My wife, two of our children, ages 3 and 7, and my in-laws (no
really, we're glad they came!) make up our party.
</P>
<P>
   And now we're cruising slowly up the Suwannee. That puts us one
up on Stephen Foster, who never actually saw the river.
</P>
<P>
   I can see well from the helm through sliding glass doors and
large windows. I try steering with my toes, moving them from spoke
to spoke on the wooden wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The banks are lined with untouched cypress and native hardwood
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing on the Suwannee is a big draw, but heavy rains before
our arrival have temporarily changed that.
</P>
<P>
   More disappointing for us, the high water has flooded and closed
Manatee Springs State Park. Easily reached by the second day, most
house boaters anchor in the river, taking rafts and tubes to the
park's crystal clear water.
</P>
<P>
   Since our trip, the park has opened, and fishing is good again.
Bass, brim, and catfish are found in the river's fresh waters,
speckled trout and redfish in the salt waters of the lower river.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least 20 springs along the 80-mile stretch of river
that Miller's Marina allows its houseboats to navigate, a
round-trip that would take five to seven days.
</P>
<P>
   The first evening, we anchor early enough to enjoy the sharp
colors a setting sun pours across the trees on one river bank,
which soften and fade while we make spaghetti and salad.
</P>
<P>
   My wife spies an osprey in a nest. The fish-eating birds are
plentiful, and resemble bald eagles, which also can be seen in the
refuge.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, after a scrambled egg breakfast, we continue up
the river, a series of lazy arcs. We rarely see another boat.
</P>
<P>
   The current is so strong, from all the extra water, that on the
second evening we can only get one of the two anchors to the bottom
of the river.
</P>
<P>
   We grill hamburgers, and play more games around the table.
Everyone's in bed before I realize we have forgotten to look for
stars, and I slip out of the bunk for a peek.
</P>
<P>
   The sky's an explosion of constellations. The brightest are
reflected in the black water's surface, and I'm unexpectedly
surrounded by stars as I walk to the rail _ a houseboat astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   ROLLING ON THE RIVER
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: The only part that is physically demanding is
pulling up anchor, which sometimes gets stuck in the mud. If you
can lift an 80-pound sack of cement, you're OK. Other than that, I
steered the houseboat with my toes. Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   What it cost: Two nights Monday through Thursday is $446;
weekends, $535. Seven nights is $1,070.
</P>
<P>
   Where is it? From West Palm Beach, take Florida's Turnpike north
to I-75. Go north and exit on U.S. 27. Go north, then west on
Alternate U.S. 27. Turn left onto County Road 349 at Old Town. It
dead ends at Suwannee. Trip takes about six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's will send you a package in the mail after making your
reservation, which includes a list of things you may want to bring.
Here are some additional things, however, that youmight want to
consider which are not on their list:
</P>
<P>
   What to bring: Miller sends guests a list, of what to bring, but
here are some other suggestions for what to bring:
</P>
<P>
   _ Food in coolers, or buy it at the full-sized Food Lane
grocery, where you turn onto State Road 349.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cell phone. For emergencies, there is a two-way marine radio
that is monitored by the marina until 5 p.m. After that, if you
have a cell phone, you can dial Miller's home.
</P>
<P>
   _ A good pair of binoculars, so you can scan the banks for
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   _ A canoe or small motor boat to pull along behind your
houseboat. The marina only has a few aging canoes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rafts or tubes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Plastic bags for anything from garbage to dirty laundry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Life vests for young children. Vests provided with the boat
are the standard, bulky orange ones, and may not fit well or be
very comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pots, pans, and cutlery on board were adequate, but we were
short on cups. Bring serving spoons, a spatula, large and small
cooking knives, and a cutting board. Some or all of these may be
provided, but may not necessarily be in the greatest shape.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paper cups and plates, if you want to minimize dish washing.
(And save that hot water for your showers!)
</P>
<P>
   _ Towels. They're not provided.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ear plugs. For heat or air conditioning at night, you must run
the boat's generator. The noise may put some to sleep, but others
might wish they had ear plugs. On a windy night, the surface chop
slapping against the boat's hull might also bother some people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cards and games.

 &HT;    THE WALKING TOUR: FIND OUT WHERE TO GET A REAL BEIGNET
 &HT;    By PAUL LOMARTIRE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA _ Carmen Morales, who grew up in Ybor City, can bring the
past back with anecdotes that make a 1-mile walking tour a lively
excursion.
</P>
<P>
   A volunteer guide, she'll tell you about her history, which is
Ybor's history, too. The nightclubs where she learned to rumba and
jitterbug and stages where she and other immigrant kids put on
talent shows. The clinic where her grandfather died and the shoe
store where Ybor kids got their Sunday shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Morales is also an Ybor City realist. She acknowledges that her
favorite part of Tampa, which she left in 1950, was crumbling into
oblivion before the upscale bars and restaurants turned it into a
profit center.
</P>
<P>
   The tours start at Ybor Square and you quickly find out many of
the nightclubs come with instant history. At Ybor Square, The Jazz
Cellar is located in the cool, dry rooms where Vincente Ybor stored
his tobacco leaves.
</P>
<P>
   The small, white building that was the historic Methodist Church
is now an upscale joint called the Red Star Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   A landmark clothing store that served generations, Fernandez Y
Garcia's, on the corner of 14th Street and Seventh Avenue is now
the all-nude Club Flamingo. A clinic where generations were born
and died is now the Sugar Plum Ballroom featuring Latin and swing
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   On 16th Street across a plaza from the Centro Espanol social
club in the heart of Ybor City is the St. Frances Cafe. It was
opened in 1996 by former nurse Lisa Sizemore in what once was a
central clinic for Ybor immigrants. The cafe won immediate media
attention, including NBC's Today show, because customers are not
given a check for their meal but are asked to pay what they can
afford.
</P>
<P>
   The menu leans toward health food and includes such basics as
pot roast, mashed potatoes and green beans, all made by Sizemore.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Frances, though popular, is to give way to a 20-screen
multiplex-restaurant-shopping center modeled after Miami's CocoWalk
that's expected to open in 1999. Loyal customers including
Sizemore's neighbors are helping to find a new Ybor site for the
St. Frances Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   All along the tour you can see how cash flow is saving the past.
The Circulo Cubano - The Cuban Club - with its ballroom, bar and
theater is being restored. Five other mutual aid society clubs
where Cuban, Italian, German, African and Spanish immigrants went
for everything from medical help to dance lessons are also being
saved through restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Ybor City's original hardware store - on Eighth Avenue near 15th
Street - was owned by the family of current Tampa mayor Dick Greco.
With its high ceilings and open-air front, it now houses Creatures
of Delight, which produces latex dinosaurs and other toys. It
shares the old hardware store with La Mode, a clothing store where
you can buy a neon lime furry bikini among other strange pieces of
clothing. Morales tells you what used to be and that is the value
of her tour.
</P>
<P>
   The walking tour includes the Ybor City State Museum and Gardens
located in the former Ferlita Bakery building. The $2 admission is
a bargain. Included with the museum tour are six renovated cigar
workers' homes that have stood since 1895. One of them, La Casita,
is furnished.
</P>
<P>
   The tour ends near Centennial Park, dedicated to Ybor City's
immigrants. There you'll also find the Alessi Family's Cafe Beignet
where you can get cafe con leche and the best powdered sugar
beignets this side of Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   That stop alone should convince just about anyone that Ybor City
is surviving quite nicely.

 &HT;    YBOR CITY SPRUCED UP AND SMOKIN'
 &HT;    By PAUL LOMARTIRE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ I strolled and shopped by day and crawled bar to
bar at night.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way to see Tampa's Ybor City.
</P>
<P>
   Ybor City draws huge weekend crowds for its nightlife.
Nightclubs are shoulder-to-shoulder along the main street, Seventh
Avenue, like cheapskates at an open bar.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the case about 20 years ago when Ybor was a
crumbling, neglected, dangerous-at-night neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the city learned to cash in on its lively
history.
</P>
<P>
   A staging area for Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders 100
years ago, Ybor City was created by Cuban, Italian, German, African
and Romanian-Jewish immigrants who built lives around Vincente
Ybor's three-story cigar factory.
</P>
<P>
   Ybor moved his factory from Key West to Tampa in 1886 to escape
labor problems with Cuban workers.
</P>
<P>
   By the '70s, Ybor City's second and third generations had fled
to Tampa suburbs. Surrounded by low-income housing, Ybor became
known for cheap artists' work space and as a trendy/tacky setting
for gay bars. For those nearly down-and-out, an Ybor City apartment
wasn't much but neither was the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Then two things happened.
</P>
<P>
   The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Department moved to Ybor City
in 1978. Two years later, Vincente Ybor's original cigar factory
was renovated into the current three-story Ybor Square antique and
souvenir shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   The cops created a safe place and Vincente Ybor's beautifully
renovated cigar factory showed how to lure tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Events were brought to Ybor City. Every January, it hosts the
Outback Bowl's parade and pep rally. Each February is the annual
Gasparilla Night Parade, a safer, saner version of Mardi Gras.
</P>
<P>
   Today, this area within sight of downtown Tampa is defined by
red-brick streets, black iron lampposts and a variety of Old World
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   The dozens of nightclubs offer Latin, swing, reggae, jazz, blues
and rock-till-you-drop. Ybor's eclectic mix of shops won't
disappoint anyone looking for cigars, tattoos, body piercing, art
(from seven galleries), '60s nostalgia, antique clothing, flags,
pottery, just plain weird clothing and gargoyle statues.
</P>
<P>
   Along with coffee cafes, ice cream parlors and bakeries, the
choice of restaurants include traditional Spanish, Cuban and
Italian, not to mention wood-stove pizzas and even a cafe where you
can get a psychic reading with your food.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: You sweat according to how hot and sticky it is _
count on sweating even at midnight. The only work your thighs do
body does is climbing onto bar stools.
</P>
<P>
   Where to find those bar stools: The Green Iguana, Frankie's
Patio, Club Irie, Full Moon Saloon, Fat Tuesdays, The Edge, Spurs,
Irish Pub and Blue's Ship.
</P>
<P>
   What's next in Ybor: A Hilton Hotel (1999), a multiplex
entertainment center resembling Coconut Grove's Coco Walk (1999), a
trolley system (1999) and a 436-unit apartment complex are
scheduled to open in 1999(1999) .
</P>
<P>
   Did you know . . . ? Winston Churchill, Grover Cleveland and
Frederick Remington all stayed at the El Pasaje Hotel, built in
Ybor in 1888 and home to the men-only Cherokee Club. Today, the
Cherokee Club is a men-only club of another kind.

WHAT HAPPENED TO LOYALTY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 5, 1962, President John F. Kennedy gave his special
assistant and longtime friend David Powers a birthday present, a
silver beer mug inscribed: ``There are three things which are real:
God, human folly and laughter. The first two are beyond our
comprehension, so we must do what we can with the third.''
</P>
<P>
   After JFK's death, Tom Wicker of The New York Times wrote an
article for Esquire in which he said the quote's origin was
uncertain. Not so, responded Jack Valenti, who cited ``The
Ramayana,'' by Aubrey Menen, the British novelist and essayist.
</P>
<P>
   Valenti knew his literature and knew his place. He was a special
assistant to Lyndon B. Johnson, Kennedy's successor. Valenti has
since prospered as head of the Motion Picture Assn., but, like Dave
Powers, is a loyalist.
</P>
<P>
   Powers died this year, as did another of JFK's ``band of
brothers,'' Billy Sutton, who entered politics, he said, ``before
it was a crime.'' Both were Charlestown residents who helped out in
JFK's first congressional race in 1946. That era is revived in the
refurbished exhibits of the Kennedy Library, which recreates a
Boston street, a campaign headquarters, and a feeling that laughter
and loyalty were necessary parts of politics, not strangers to it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the rivalries between the staffs of JFK and LBJ, Powers
would have appreciated Valenti's recent musings on loyalty in The
Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``All presidential assistants, current and former, have a
loosely connected but nonetheless real kinship to each other. Each
of us was lifted to the largest proscenium stage in the world by
one man and there allowed to become `celebrities.' When an
assistant departs the White House he or she usually enters what we
sardonically refer to as `the private sector' to become modestly
wealthy and sometimes more famous. But the fact is, we would not
have been attractive to our new arena without our presidential
patina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the niggling question: What does this band of brothers and
sisters, glistening in the glow of the president's power, owe the
man who gave them opportunities so few are granted?,'' Valenti
asks. ``What causes the question to be asked is the George
Stephanopoulos issue. Stephanopoulos, wearing the new velvet
garments of ABC pundit, was not only the first to publicly mention
the possibility of impeachment, but he continues to be
inferentially critical of his former boss, so soon after departing
the embrace of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti has scaled the heights of Holywood celebritydom, but
insists that, ``I would not be in my present place without my
intimacy with Lyndon Johnson. I owe him. Big time. My modest
judgment is that George Stephanopoulos is in the same debt to
President Clinton. I dare say that no publisher would pay him $2.5
million to write his memoirs, nor would ABC offer him a sizable
compensation to voice his views, if he were still leading a
hermetic existence on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   When books are written by the likes of Dick Morris with the
preposterous theme of the hired-hand-as-genius, loyalty is as rare
as laughter. JFK was too Irish to put up with that, having followed
Robert Frost's advice to ``be more Irish than Harvard.''
</P>
<P>
   JFK, in whose White House Pablo Casals played his classical
cello, preferred on his own phonograph rousing Irish songs like
those sung by the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem. He identified
with ``The Minstrel Boy,'' gone to the wars, ``his wild harp slung
behind him,'' soon to be found ``in the ranks of death.'' His
loyalists, too, could sing:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(begin poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though all the world betrays thee,
</P>
<P>
   One sword at least thy right shall guard,
</P>
<P>
   One faithful heart shall praise thee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dave Powers would have been a grand pundit, one of the funniest
talking heads on TV. Celebrity status offers many lures, but for
him, laughter always took second place to loyalty.
</P>

CHANGES IN NHL RULES ENDORSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NHL's general managers are recommending some
key rule changes that will be implemented during the 1998-99 season
if approved at the Board of Governors meeting June 25.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Tuesday, the GMs recommended that:
</P>
<P>
   _The nets and blue lines be moved 2 feet closer to center ice,
making the space between the goal line and the end boards 13 feet
rather than 11. This would reduce the neutral zone from 58 to 54
feet and increase the offensive zones by 2 feet, with the distance
between the blue lines and the goal lines remaining the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``By moving the net out 2 feet, it will be more risky for
goalies to go out and handle the puck,'' said Bruins president/GM
Harry Sinden. ``I was a little unsure whether that wouldn't be too
far. I thought maybe we could get the same job done with 1 foot,
but this will tell us more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that the power play can operate more
efficiently with that kind of room and therefore increase the
offense. At equal strength, it might be easier to operate
offensively. The defensemen defending with 2 feet extra behind the
net may be able to move the puck out easier.''
</P>
<P>
   _The semicircle of the goal crease be reduced by 2 feet total on
either side of the goalposts, with straight lines to mark the side
edges of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   _The video goal judge be allowed to call down to the referee to
advise whether a player was in the crease at the time a goal was
scored. The referee still would determine whether a player was
pushed into the crease. The current rule allows only the referee to
request such a review.
</P>
<P>
   _A second referee be phased into regular-season games. Sinden
said his understanding was that a two-referee system would be used
in about 20-25 percent of the league's games. NHL director of
hockey operations Brian Burke said this experiment would be
completed by March 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has some plusses,'' said Sinden. ``People are not going to
be able to get away with things behind the play. It may result in
more penalties to begin with, but once players realize two guys are
watching them, I think it will be OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a general feeling the game is faster today. There's a
lot of action behind the play that he can't see. In general, we may
be able to be more proficient and efficient if we have four eyes
instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it triples the amount of power plays in a game, it's going
to turn me, for one, off and others, too, I imagine. It's going to
be used in some games, enough games so that when the season ended,
we can make a tremendous comparison between two referees vs. one.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
On and on
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has come under fire lately for its season lasting so
long and its TV ratings being down. Sinden would like to see the
season wrap up before mid-June. ``I think we can cut it back
some,'' he said. ``We were up against Michael Jordan, and that's
very difficult to overcome. It's more a result of the Olympics than
anything.'' ... Sinden plans to make qualifying offers to most of
the Bruins who are eligible. He declined to name those who won't
receive offers and therefore will become unrestricted free agents
... Sinden said he has talked to the representative for Group 2
free agent Kyle McLaren. ``They made an overture to us and we
responded,'' he said. ``Now we're waiting for a proposal but we
haven't gotten one.'' Sinden also has talked to Mark Witkin, the
agent for Group 2 free agent Ted Donato. ``We had a meeting of the
minds,'' he said, ``but here again, I don't know where it's
going.'' ... Red Wings defenseman Vyacheslav Fetisov has filed a
lawsuit against the limousine company and driver who were involved
in last year's accident that injured him and two colleagues. The
lawsuit was filed Monday in Oakland (Mich.) County Court. It seeks
unspecified damages from John Gambino, Gambino Limousine, and
driver Richard Gnida. Gnida was driving Fetisov, defenseman
Vladimir Konstantinov and team masseur Sergei Mnatsakanov in a
limousine when it crashed.

CURTAIN HAS YET TO FALL ON STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not over.
</P>
<P>
   A split decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court
does not settle the questions that surround the violent death of 8
1/2-month-old Matthew Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   The issues his death raised in bold relief _ from the options
for child care to the realities of child abuse _ do not magically
resolve themselves with the end of the criminal phase of
Commonwealth v. Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   The same arguments that divided families and friends during
Woodward's criminal trial last fall will be played out again in the
wrongful death lawsuit filed against Woodward Tuesday and in the
negligence suit sure to come against the agency that recruited the
British teenager and placed her as an au pair in Deborah and Sunil
Eappen's Newton home.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth v. Woodward becomes Eappen v. Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   The civil chapter of this saga will be no less wrenching than
the criminal chapter now concluded with the SJC's 4-3 affirmation
of the trial judge's decision to reduce Woodward's second-degree
murder conviction to manslaughter and to set her free after only
279 days in prison.
</P>
<P>
   One need only substitute the phrase ``vindictive parents'' for
``overzealous prosecutors'' to get an idea of the defense strategy
likely to be used against the Eappens in civil court.
</P>
<P>
   Why put themselves through it? Why invite a public that has made
a cottage industry of second-guessing their motives to chide them
for not ``letting it go,'' for not ``getting on with their lives,''
as if their baby's brutal death at the hands of a trusted au pair
were an accident to be ``gotten over.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the SJC dismissed the image of Woodward as a hapless victim
of circumstance, stating unequivocally that ``we do not view the
judgment against Woodward as a light matter. She stands guilty of
causing an infant's violent death. The outcome of this criminal
trial most assuredly was not an acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not an acquittal, but not justice either. Not if we equate
justice with accountability.
</P>
<P>
   How, the Eappens ask themselves, is a young woman who is
greedily negotiating book contracts and movie deals being held
accountable for shaking their infant son senseless?
</P>
<P>
   How is a young woman who is courting celebrity and dating
tabloid photographers being held accountable for inflicting a 2
1/2-inch fracture in Matty's tiny skull?
</P>
<P>
   In his dissenting opinion, Justice John Greaney unwittingly
provides some insight into the Eappens' need to press forward,
recognizing, as Judge Hiller Zobel did not, that their voices, that
Matty's voice, should have been heard at sentencing. Zobel ``may
have failed properly to consider for purposes of sentencing the
impact of Woodward's crime on Matthew's family,'' Greaney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the judge identified himself with Woodward's cause,
compromising the public's confidence in the integrity and
impartiality of our courts.''
</P>
<P>
   By not remanding the case for resentencing to another judge who
might have imposed probationary conditions barring Woodward from
caring for children or profiting from her crime, the high court
Tuesday lost an opportunity to ``engender confidence in the
fairness and impartiality of our judicial system, maintain the
dignity and integrity of our courts, and bring rightful closure to
this difficult case,'' in Greaney's words.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, even to Deborah and Sunil Eappen, what exactly
would constitute ``rightful closure'' in this case. A successful
prosecution of their claims in civil court could impose an
accountability on Louise now absent; a positive resolution of their
claims against Woodward and, eventually, EF Au Pair, could impose
tougher recruiting and training standards on those who would care
for children; an award of monetary damages for the pain of Matty's
death would fund the Matty Eappen Foundation to educate the public
about shaken baby syndrome and the many other manifestations of
child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Those would not be small victories for a family struggling to
make sense of a senseless loss.
</P>
<P>
   No judicial ruling will bring Matty home from the intensive care
unit of Children's Hospital. No court decision will prevent a
grieving mother from seeing the reflection of her lost son in the
eyes of the 3-week-old son she nurses at her breast. No judgment of
any court will ever deem this case over for Deborah and Sunil
Eappen.

<P>
   Its East Coast food empire will stretch from Gloucester, Mass.,
to the Florida-Georgia border. And with Stop &AMP; Shop likely to
contribute more than $5.5 billion to the total, Ahold expects its
US sales could account for nearly $20 billion of its roughly $30
billion in annual worldwide revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Ahold to make more acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we need to be $100 billion in worldwide sales in a few
years,'' says Stop &AMP; Shop's Grize of Ahold's plans.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, Ahold's home turf, the food business is different.
Stores stock fewer items and rely less on brand names.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, you won't find nine kinds of yogurt in a
supermarket,'' says Shaw's Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   And in Europe, you won't find the pervasive American-style
television advertising that stimulates brand loyalty for everything
from Cheerios to Coca-Cola, he suggests.
</P>
<P>
   In this vacuum of brand loyalty, European food stores load their
shelves with house-brand items. By cutting out brokers and
middlemen, these house brands can mean lower prices for customers _
and higher profit margins for grocers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Rogan, house brands account for about half of a
European grocer's sales; in the United States, that number may be
only 20 to 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, British food operator J Sainsbury PLC brought some
of its house-brand grocery strategy to the United States when it
bought Shaw's. Yet in 1998, some observers still wonder whether
this strategy can work on a grand scale in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's top job has been vacant for a few months; operating
profits have dipped. And earlier this year, Shaw's scaled back on
Connecticut expansion plans, says Griffin, the industry newsletter
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's worked as well as they had hoped,'' Griffin
says of the chain's house-brand strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan counters that the numbers show otherwise. In 1997, he
says, house brands at Shaw's accounted for about 40 percent of the
chain's $2.8 billion in sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the envy of the industry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   As a smaller chain with just over $1 billion in annual sales,
Star Market may face some different challenges.
</P>
<P>
   With so much consolidation in the US grocery industry, the best
way for a small independent chain to survive may be to carve out
its own niche, says Kurt Funderburg, a supermarket analyst with
Ferris, Baker, Watts in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the strategy of Star Market, a 53-store chain.
Star's hope is that it can become a publicly owned company someday,
says Star chief executive Henry Nasella.
</P>
<P>
   By Nasella's lights, creating a niche means designing each store
to fit an individual neighborhood, with the same care a tailor uses
to fashion a custom-made suit.
</P>
<P>
   Star's newest store, which just opened between Kendall and
Central squares in Cambridge, is a case in point, Nasella says.
</P>
<P>
   Rival Stop &AMP; Shop once had a store nearby, but neighborhood
residents and the company couldn't reach an agreement when Stop &AMP;
Shop wanted to convert and expand the location into its highly
efficient and profitable superstore format.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than continue to operate at a small, antiquated store
that no longer meshed with its superstore formula, Stop &AMP; Shop left
the neighborhood, and Star moved in.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by the higher costs of operating in urban areas not
ideally suited to supermarket logistics, Star's new store is
located on two levels of a hotel, the University Park, something
Nasella says has never been done before.
</P>
<P>
   In his view, Star is competing as much with restaurants as with
other supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter believes a good meal comes from a menu, not a
recipe,'' Nasella says.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter might approve of the new Star, which is full of
meals-to-go and ethnic cuisines carefully matched to the
demographic breakdown of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to ride the popularity of high-profit natural foods, the
store features a Wild Harvest section. Star has also opened four
free-standing stores under the Wild Harvest name.
</P>
<P>
   Like most new supermarkets, the Star in Cambridge aims to
provide one-stop &UR;  &LR; shopping for its customers. Many new stores, in
fact, include a bank branch, a dry cleaners, a pharmacy, and a
flower section.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, one-stop &UR;  &LR; shopping has evolved to an even higher
level. In so-called ``hyper-stores,'' customers can buy everything
from duck pate to snow tires.
</P>
<P>
   About a decade ago, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart debuted its own
variation, called a Supercenter. In stores as large as 220,000
square feet, grocery aisles have been added to traditional Wal-Mart
discount wares.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Wal-Mart's 469 Supercenters are in the South and
Midwest, says spokesman Keith Morris. In searching for new store
sites, Wal-Mart looks for places where real estate is readily
available and the local population is growing.
</P>
<P>
   That would rule out most of New England for the moment, but
Wal-Mart has just announced plans to open a 40,000-square-foot
``convenience store'' that will sell groceries in its hometown of
Bentonville, Ark. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart rivals such as Kmart and
Target are also experimenting with groceries.
</P>
<P>
   These food forays may not be instantly felt in New England, but
they're fueling supermarket consolidation elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Threatened by the discount stores, small independent chains are
selling out to larger supermarket rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The planned Giant sale to Ahold may prompt more acquisitions.
Shaw's parent, Sainsbury, owned a stake in Giant. Will it still
make sense for Sainsbury to keep Shaw's as its only US chain?
</P>
<P>
   Safeway Inc. faces a similar dilemma. Far from its California
base, it operates stores on Giant's Washington-Baltimore turf.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway may either have to make an East Coast acquisition or
sell the East Coast stores it has now, analyst Funderburg says.
</P>
<P>
   With all this jockeying, is a national supermarket chain
possible? Some observers think so. Thanks to scanning devices and
shopper loyalty cards, grocers know more about their customers'
food preferences than ever before. With such technology, it may be
possible for a grocery giant to please salsa lovers in places as
diverse as Texas and Massachusetts.

YOUNG THEOLOGIAN BELIEVES GENERATION X HAS KEPT THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Tom Beaudoin is not your typical theologian engaged in
esoteric explications of ancient religious texts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he uses MTV as a research lab. He studies tattoos and
body piercing as expressions of spirituality. And he's also in a
rock band made up of other theologians.
</P>
<P>
   Beaudoin, 29, is a self-described Generation Xer, that amorphous
population cohort born in the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. Beaudoin
wants to be their theologian. He believes that Generation X _
contrary to popular perception _ is deeply spiritual, if not
necessarily devout.
</P>
<P>
   You just need to look at their taste in music, movies, and
dress, says Beaudoin, a PhD candidate at Boston College. He makes
his case in a new book, ``Virtual Faith: The Irreverent Spiritual
Quest of Generation X.''
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that Generation X isn't interested in religion,
Beaudoin argues. It's simply that its members are looking for a
religion they can believe in. And what GenXers are after can't
easily be found within the four walls and under the steeple of the
local church.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the spirituality of Generation X you have to look
at popular culture, particularly media culture. There has never
been another generation, Beaudoin says, so intimately linked to
media culture _ the Internet, television, film, and music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop culture is our amniotic fluid; it's where we find meaning
in our life,'' says Beaudoin, a Roman Catholic who strayed from the
faith for a few years before becoming convinced that the church's
tradition and teachings can appeal to people in his generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his Somerville apartment, overflowing with books and
CDs, he ticks off examples of spiritual or religious themes he sees
in contemporary youth culture.
</P>
<P>
   There are strong religious or spiritual undercurrents in recent
albums by artists ranging from U2 to Sarah McLachlan to Puff Daddy.
Religious messages are also sprinkled more frequently in movies,
for example, in ``Contact,'' ``Chasing Amy,'' and even ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama has become hugely popular among young people, not
just because he is a stirring champion of human rights, but because
people are drawn to his Tibetan Buddhist teachings as a way of
coping with life's stresses.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Cox, a renowned professor at Harvard Divinity School
where Beaudoin received a master's degree, said at first blush it
might seem foolish to suggest that Generation X is interested in
spiritual meaning. But, in a forward to Beaudoin's book, Cox says
his former student might be on to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a generation that stays away from most churches in
droves but loves songs about God and Jesus, a generation that would
score very low on any standard piety scale but at times seems
almost obsessed with saints, visions, and icons in all shapes and
sizes,'' Cox writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the young people who, styrofoam cups of cappuccino
in hand, crowd around the shelves of New Age spirituality titles in
the local book market and post thousands of religious and
quasi-religion notes on the bulletin boards in cyberspace.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Beaudoin and Cox both note that Pope John Paul II enjoys a
strong following among people in the Generation X population. Last
summer, even the Vatican was stunned when more than a million young
people turned out to help John Paul celebrate World Youth Day in
Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Beaudoin, in his book, identifies several themes that underpin
the ``theology'' of Generation X. First is a deep suspicion of
institutions, including organized religion. Second is the
importance of having a personal spiritual experience.
</P>
<P>
   Beaudoin says the Catholic Church, in its liturgy, must do a
better job of ``giving people a powerful experience of the Holy
Spirit, which is the only way people will realize there is
something at stake to being Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   A third theme among Generation Xers is a belief that suffering
can be a redemptive, spiritual experience. Finally, Generation Xers
believe ambiguity is a central part of faith. Rather than fearing
uncertainty, Beaudoin says, Generation Xers embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   Beaudoin has started a Catholic ministry aimed at people in
Generation X at the Paulist Center in downtown Boston. ``GenXers
are hungry for spirituality and the challenge is to find the most
effective means of satisfying that hunger,'' he said.

   A Vatican envoy has recently visited Iraq, reportedly to discuss
the possibility of adding that nation to a possible millennium tour
of the Holy Land by Pope John Paul II. The Iraqi town of Ur is the
traditional home of the prophet Abraham before he set out with his
family for the biblical land of Canaan. Abraham is revered by
Christians, Jews, and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   The tour would include stops in Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon,

SOCIETAL, LEGAL CHANGES ARE LEGACIES OF A PUBLIC TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Louise Woodward case was Massachusetts'
contribution to the media phenomenon of the '90s _ the televised
trial as meeting place for public grievances.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a forensic whodunit, dense with dueling medical
experts, became a local equivalent of the O.J. Simpson case, a
prism through which people projected their own anxieties onto those
wrestling with the law. And, like the Simpson case, there is a
civil trial yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Simpson trial featured spousal abuse, the Woodward
trial featured child abuse. Where Simpson spotlighted race,
Woodward spotlighted class. And when the criminal trial ended, with
a rapid series of legal somersaults, this case _ like Simpson's _
left lingering concerns about whether television, with its
magnifying effect, is distorting the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``These events are often a seamless web of spectacle and
tutorial,'' observed Ralph Whitehead, journalism professor at the
University of MassachusettsTuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Show trials can stimulate viewers to reflect on issues that
otherwise rarely enter the public discourse _ in this case, the
difficulties of working parents in securing affordable and reliable
day care.
</P>
<P>
   Television can also blow open the courthouse doors and reveal
uncomfortable truths about the justice system _ in this case, the
vagaries of decision-making by prosecutors, defense lawyers, and
judges, and how they can alter the outcome of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, serious discourse can quickly devolve into
Jerry Springer-like name-calling, stirring up ignorance or even
prejudice in the guise of man-on-the-street opinions _ in this
case, some extreme views on working women's duties to their
children or the irresponsible nature of young women.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's trial rang up the highest ratings of the year on
Court TV in the United States, and it became a prime-time
attraction in Woodward's native England. Playing in 3 million homes
a night, the trial came across to Britons as the railroading of an
innocent girl; one poll revealed that an astonishing 98 percent of
the country believed that Woodward was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist, a British magazine, noted, ``England is the home
of Mary Poppins; Massachusetts is the scene of the Salem
witch-hunts; and so the televised trial of an English au pair in
Massachusetts played on potent stereotypes from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   But what cultural footprints, if any, will be left after this
event? Much grief was aired. Little was settled. There is no
consensus on Woodward's culpability. Nor is there a definitive view
of who was more poorly served by the legal process, Woodward or
Deborah and Sunil Eappen, the parents of the baby who died under
Woodward's care. The British aren't even sure whether to be
appalled by the tawdriness of the US justice system _ or to put
their own trials on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the president of EF Au Pair, the Cambridge company that
arranged Woodward's placement in the Eappens' home, says the case
brought about major changes in the way au pairs are trained. Echoes
of the hubbub surrounding the case can still be heard in Congress,
where tax credits to help parents pay for childcare remains on a
short list of policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   And in the State House, some observers insist that the case's
greatest legacy is in prompting a statewide change of heart on the
death penalty after the murder of 11-year-old Jeffrey Curley stoked
support. Two days before the Woodward verdict, the House voted to
institute capital punishment, overcoming concerns that innocent
people might be found guilty of murder and executed. Then came the
jury's vote to convict Woodward of second-degree murder, even
though millions of trial-watchers insisted she was innocent. The
House reversed itself a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``People involved in lobbying (against) the death penalty called
here to say they wanted to thank Louise,'' said one of her lawyers,
Harvey Silverglate. Although only one legislator changed his vote
because of Woodward, many others were prepared to do so if
necessary, Silverglate said. ``This case changed more than one
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Execution was never a possibility for Woodward, but her
conviction exposed a fragility in the criminal law that weakened
the argument for harsh, irreversible punishment. After all, if the
system were capable of neatly separating the wrongdoers from the
wrongly accused, how could so many people watch Woodward's trial
and come away with differing views of her guilt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people thought she was innocent _ she got a raw deal,''
explained George Katsinis, a waiter at the Sweet Touch restaurant
across from the courthouse on Cambridge Street, which served
throngs of trial watchers. ``But it didn't start out that way _ it
turned about halfway through. Then when she got the light sentence
it turned again. People were upset about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Katsinis could look out the front window of the
Sweet Touch and see streets clogged with TV-news trucks and
sidewalks filled with sign-waving protesters. The crowd outside the
courthouse thickened daily, drawn by outrage _ several types of
outrage. Some people were inflamed by Woodward's alleged offense _
shaking to death a baby who had been in her care. Others, convinced
there was little evidence linking Woodward to the baby's death,
were incensed over Middlesex District Attorney Thomas Reilly's
decision to charge her with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike famous trials of the past _ from Alfred Dreyfus in France
to the Rosenbergs' prosecution for treason in the US _ today's TV
trials aren't simply about judging the accused. TV plays off the
audience. TV trials soak up, like sponges, the vagrant attitudes of
their onlookers. The rendering of justice becomes something more
than an individual denouement: It becomes America's day in court.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those fascinated by the Woodward case had strong
feelings about working mothers, and applied them to Dr. Deborah
Eappen, the baby's mother, an ophthalmologist who saw patients
three days a week. To some who followed the trial at home during
the day _ a group that inevitably included many stay-at-home
mothers and paid nannies _ Deborah Eappen became a symbol for a
generation of women who had, in their view, sacrificed homemaking
for the personal gratification of careers.

   If a 10 percent drop in prices is considered a ``correction,''
Massachusetts stocks now officially qualify.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloomberg Massachusetts index is down 10.2 percent from its
high on April 22, the same day broader market indices such as the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq Composite also topped out. By
comparison, the technology-heavy Nasdaq is down 8.5 percent while
the S&AMP;P is down 3.8 percent. The much narrower Dow Jones industrial
average is down 5.9 percent since its May 13 high.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the stock market rebounded somewhat following Monday's
207-point rout of the Dow. While the Dow index rose just 37.36
points to close at 8665.29, the Nasdaq soared 37.37, or 2.1
percent. US bonds posted the biggest loss in almost seven weeks as
the dollar declined against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Not many Massachusetts stocks have been able to buck this moody
market. Of the 350 stocks we track on a daily basis, just 75 have
shown gains since the April selloff began. About 75 stocks have
lost 25 percent or more in value in less than two months.

   Does what is happening in Asia matter on Boston's Route 128?
Check out the list of big losers.
</P>
<P>
   We took our 350 stocks and screened out companies with a market
value of less than $250 million. Five of the 10 stocks that took
the biggest hits have cited the effects of the slowing Asian
economies on their businesses. Nine of the 10 are tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is loaded with companies that make equipment for
the semiconductor business, and virtually all of them have been hit
hard. PRI Automation in Billerica, a favorite target of
short-sellers, is down 41 percent from its high. Analog Devices is
down 40 percent, and Teradyne is down 31 percent. All three stocks
showed gains with Tuesday's tech recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Some very small companies _ with market caps under $250 million
_ have really been crushed. Ergo Science, a Charlestown drug maker
that failed to win government approval for a new drug, is down 77
percent since April 22. Spire in Bedford, which has been pushing
its equipment to make solar panels in Asia, is down 65 percent; the
stock has fallen from 17 1/2 in January to 3 7/8. SystemSoft, a
Natick software company, is also down 65 percent; its stock, which
sold for 35 in 1996, is at 15/16 today.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers are among the few winners. Talbots, a longtime
underperformer, was up 32 percent, and TJX, long an overachiever,
was up 8 percent; both are reporting strong same-store sales.
StrideRite was up 15 percent, reflecting market sentiment that its
flagship Keds brand is finally back on track.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest winner on our list was a technology company,
Pegasystems. Last year stock in the Cambridge customer-service
software maker was hammered when an accounting mix-up forced it to
restate earnings for three quarters. But analysts say the
accounting issues seem to be history, and last month the company
reported better-than-expected earnings. While the market has
wobbled, Pegasystems' stock is up 43 percent since April 22. The
shares closed Tuesday at 28 1/4, up 1 5/8 _ a 75 percent gain from
its January low.

Rodney quitting Plymouth Rock
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keith Rodney, the man who founded Plymouth Rock Assurance Corp.
with chairman Jim Stone, is leaving. The company says it has
nothing to do with its angry agents _ but then no one is denying
the agents are hopping mad.
</P>
<P>
   Rodney, president of Plymouth Rock Assurance, says he is leaving
to pursue other interests after 16 years with the Boston automobile
insurer. Rodney, 54, will be succeeded by Hal Belodoff, who runs
Plymouth Rock's agency in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and Rodney go way back. Rodney was the deputy when Stone
first ran the state's insurance division and later the US
Commodities Futures Trading Commission. Given the history it is
unlikely he was pushed _ but there is no denying the change comes
at a difficult time for Plymouth Rock.
</P>
<P>
   From its inception, Plymouth Rock has sold its auto insurance
through agents. But Stone has launched a well-financed venture to
sell insurance directly to consumers nationwide (Massachusetts and
most of the New England states excluded). Plymouth Rock also wants
to sell discounted auto insurance directly to Massachusetts
consumers through an alliance with Savings Bank Life Insurance; the
division of insurance has blocked the proposed discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves have alarmed Plymouth Rock agents, who see the direct
sales as undercutting their own efforts. Frank Mancini, executive
vice president of the Massachusetts Association of Insurance
Agents, says he has heard from a number of Plymouth Rock's 120
agents. ``How many they'll have when this is over, I don't know,''
Mancini says.
</P>
<P>
   Plymouth Rock acknowledges some agents have been moving
business, lured by big upfront commissions from other companies.
One competitor estimated Plymouth Rock has lost 25 percent or more
of its business; Plymouth Rock denies that, and says the losses are
``not material'' to its bottomline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our agents have had concerns, and a lot of our
competitors have gone around to our agents and misstated things and
fueled the fire,'' says Paula Gold, Plymouth Rock's general
counsel. ``We are committed to our agents.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A quiet gold rush is on by companies seeking cures for cancer,
America's second biggest killer after heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific breakthroughs in the development of drugs for
treating cancer are becoming common. In May alone, two major
breakthroughs set the medical world abuzz.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, these discoveries are occurring outside the
research labs of America's medical schools _ and inside
pharmaceutical giants and small biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute, which frequently collaborates
with industry on cancer drug development, reported that private
companies paid the agency $13.4 billion last year for assistance in
research and clinical trials _ up from only $115,000 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America
estimates that large drug companies spent $1.4 billion on cancer
drug research in 1997, often in concert with small biotechnology
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is a hotbed for cancer drug work. Small firms were
responsible for more than half of the 316 cancer medicines in
development last year; about 30 were in development at small
Massachusetts firms. Here is a look at three Cambridge companies
with drugs and vaccines that could become available within five
years:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LeukoSite Inc. &LR; : This company's roots go back to the hallowed
halls of Cambridge University, where two pathology professors, one
American and one British, met while each was pursuing research
there in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the professors, Timothy Springer, &UR;  &LR; on sabbatical
from Harvard Medical School, and Herman Waldmann of Cambridge
University, would years later form the core of the company's most
promising drug, a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
</P>
<P>
   The incurable disease afflicts 120,000 adults in the United
States and Europe. The proposed drug being developed by Springer
and Waldmann aims to treat leukemia by zapping only diseased white
blood cells without harming bone marrow. If successful, the drug
would be a vast improvement over chemotherapy, which damages
healthy cells.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional chemotherapy, seriously ill leukemia patients
often relapse and die within six to nine months. But LeukoSite
believes its drug, taken in conjunction with chemotherapy, will
extend lives, &UR;  &LR; said Christopher Mirabelli, LeukoSite's president.
</P>
<P>
   The five-year-old company in April launched an
advanced &UR;  &LR; clinical trial of the proposed drug on 75 patients and
hopes to apply for Food and Drug Administration approval within the
next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In forming LeukoSite, Springer had intended to develop drugs to
treat rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. But
opportunity came knocking from England last year. Waldmann had
developed a monoclonal antibody called Campath to &UR;  &LR; treat chronic
lymphocytic leukemia. A UK drug company, Burroughs Wellcome,
licensed the antibody and conducted clinical studies with promising
results on &UR;  &LR; leukemia patients. But when Burroughs Wellcome was
acquired last year by Glaxo, another UK drugmaker, the conglomerate
decided that the potential market for Campath was too
small. &UR;  &LR; LeukoSite snapped up the license.
</P>
<P>
   But tiny LeukoSite, which has 80 employees, needed a bigger
partner to carry out more clinical trials. It forged a 50-50 joint
venture last May with Ilex Oncology Inc. of San Antonio, which
agreed to handle clinical development and commercialization of the
drug. &UR;  &LR; Last August, LeukoSite went public, raising $17 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts estimate that if LeukoSite's leukemia drug is
approved in the year 2000, the company could generate sales of more
than $6 million the first year, climbing to between $75 million and
$100 million three years later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Therion Biologics Corp.:  &LR; Cancer wasn't on Dennis Panicali's
radar screen originally.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, he founded Therion Biologics to develop a
vaccine for AIDS. When he asked large pharmaceutical companies to
fund his idea, they weren't interested. So, in 1993, he switched to
developing a cancer vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't like that, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hear drug companies and investors say, `When you cure
cancer, come back and see me,''' Panicali recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Cambridge company has 30 employees and has secured
funding from the US government and from a large French
pharmaceutical company. It's now leading an increasingly crowded
field of companies &UR;  &LR; seeking vaccines for a variety of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still at the very early stages of cancer vaccines,
trying to figure out why some tumors respond and others don't, and
the research is promising,'' said Dr. Robert Wittes, director of
the division of cancer treatment and diagnosis at the National
Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of therapeutic vaccines is not to prevent cancer but to
prevent a relapse among patients who have been treated with
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer patients in Therion's clinical trials receive a vaccine
that contains a live but weakened virus that stimulates the body's
immune system into making protective antibodies to fight off cancer
cells.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In the past year, Therion's research breakthroughs have begun
to produce financial results. The company was awarded funds from
the National Cancer Institute to conduct clinical trials of some
vaccines. And in January, Pasteur Merieux Connaught, a leader in
vaccine development, pledged up to $25 million to further test and
develop Therion's vaccines for colon and lung cancer and for
melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preliminary success of some of these small companies and
the recognition that the pharmaceutical industry has worked 30
years looking for new treatments with only minimal success have
prompted everyone to seek out new arenas like vaccines in the
battle against cancer,'' Panicali said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's next plan is to develop a therapeutic
vaccine for breast and ovarian cancers.
</P>
<P>
   But Panicali is the first to acknowledge that cancer vaccines
are a risky venture for a company that has raised a modest $20
million in venture capital since its formation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the recent headlines of drugs that work in mice,'' he
said, ``there is still a lot of healthy skepticism, some of which
is justifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.:  &LR; Joshua Boger's holy grail is
creating a kinder, gentler cancer medication that also is more
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways of attacking cancer without intensifying the
process,'' said Boger, founder and president of Vertex
Pharmaceuticals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   His company is staking part of its future on Incel, which would
be used with some chemotherapy agents, such as Taxol, to better
target and eliminate cancer cells while reducing the vicious side
effects from chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Vertex is targeting the estimated 500,000 advanced cancer
patients for whom standard anticancer medications just don't work.
</P>
<P>
   Incel is designed to overcome multidrug-resistance _ that's when
cancer patients unsuccessfully try a battery of chemotherapy drugs
or develop an immunity to cancer medications during lengthy
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Some Wall Street analysts have projected the market for
multiresistant drugs at $1 billion a year, if Vertex and its
closest rival, Novartis A.G., the large Swiss-based pharmaceutical
company, obtain FDA approval for their cancer drugs. Last month
Novartis said it would begin a 700-patient advanced clinical trial
for its drug, which is a second generation derivative to
cyclosporine, a drug known for its toxic side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge market,'' said David Stone, biotechnology
analyst with Cowen &AMP; Co. ``If either Novartis or Vertex or both are
successful, one would expect a &UR;  &LR; lot of other companies to jump in
and reignite multidrug-resistance programs. ... Vertex has a chance
to become among the first to gain broad use of its drug in this
part of the cancer market.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year Vertex launched four intermediate stage clinical
trials targeting breast cancer, ovarian cancer, soft tissue
sarcoma, and liver cancer. Vertex is also planning to start later
this year two more intermediate trials for patients with prostate
and lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   And although Vertex does not have a US partner to fund Incel's
advanced clinical trials, money is not a problem for the
250-employee company. &UR;  &LR; With significant funding from corporate
partners for four other proposed drugs, plus a secondary offering
that netted $149 million, Vertex had a hefty $266 million in cash
at the end of the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vertex has plenty of options,'' said Stone.

WORLD CUP TEAM GETS SET FOR '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ONEONTA, N.Y. _ The spotlight may be on their male
counterparts at the World Cup, but the US women's national soccer
team has hardly been hibernating this year: It is 13-1-1 in matches
around the globe as it prepares for the 1999 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-team World Cup will be held at seven venues in the United
States, including Foxboro Stadium. Although final rosters are far
from set, several women could feel right at home for their
first-round match June 20.
</P>
<P>
   At least five players in the current 42-member national team
pool from which the World Cup squad likely will be chosen have ties
to New England. The best known _ so far, at least _ are 1996
Olympic gold medalists Kristine Lilly and Brianna Scurry, but
Jennifer Mead, Tracy Ducar, and Sara Whalen are eager for their
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly, a 27-year-old midfielder who grew up in Wilton, Conn.,
became the world's all-time leader _ male or female _ in
international soccer appearances when she played in her 152d
international game May 21. Scurry helped lead the University of
Massachusetts to a 17-3-3 record and the semifinals of the NCAA
Final Four in 1993 before becoming the most capped goalkeeper (each
international game played is a ``cap'') in the history of the US
women's national team.
</P>
<P>
   The other three also played either high school or college soccer
in the region. Actually, when it comes to New England, Mead covers
the whole field: a basketball and soccer star at
Bridgewater-Raynham High before graduating from Providence College
in 1994, the 26-year-old is now girls' soccer coach at Newton North
High as well as goaltender for the Boston Renegades. Mead is 3-0-0
in six games with the national team dating back to 1993, although
she has yet to play in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ducar, meanwhile, is 3-0-0 in four games this year and 10-1-0
with 18 caps since her debut in 1996. Better known in the Bay State
as Tracy Noonan before her marriage in April 1997, she was a
standout keeper for North Andover High, from which she graduated in
1991, before an All-American career at the University of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Although Scurry still sees most of the action, the 25-year-old
Ducar is patient. ``Every time I get in, it's a chance for me to
show myself,'' said Ducar recently before a game against New
Zealand at the Soccer Hall of Fame here. ``But Bri's a much more
experienced goalkeeper. I can't expect to become the No. 1
goalkeeper overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducar got her fifth start of the year in goal that night, but it
came to little: The match was called because of lightning after
only 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   When she isn't with the national team, Ducar, who now lives near
Chapel Hill, N.C., plays with the Raleigh Wings of the W-League and
works out with members of the North Carolina-Greensboro men's team,
which she calls ``not good for my ego but good for my
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Whalen, whose first training camp with the national team came in
January 1995 after her freshman year at the University of
Connecticut, has played in 12 games this year, getting her first
goal in a 6-0 victory over Iceland May 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first international goal was important,'' said Whalen. ``It
felt like something was beginning to pay off. It was just amazing:
`I'm scoring a goal for my country!'''
</P>
<P>
   Not that scoring was new to Whalen, who had 21 goals and 22
assists to lead UConn to the 1997 NCAA final. On the way, she
scored both goals in a stunning 2-1 semifinal upset of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   The day after UConn's 2-0 loss to North Carolina in the final,
Whalen joined the national team in Brazil. But the transition
hasn't been as easy as it was quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for me sometimes because it's not like UConn,
where I played such a leadership role,'' said Whalen. ``But every
day I just try to learn from the great players, and they've
accepted me really well.''
</P>
<P>
   The months leading up to the final cutdown to the World Cup
roster won't be easy, either. ``It'll be nerve-wracking,'' said
Whalen, 22. ``I know if I play the way I can, I'll be in the top
18. Maybe my time is next year, maybe in a couple of years. Who
knows?''

NEW CEO HELPS PICTURETEL CLEAR ITS FOCUS ON THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The past year can only be described as a disaster for
PictureTel Corp. Everything that could go wrong, did go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of its video conferencing equipment plummeted amid an
industrywide slump, and the undisputed market leader lost money for
the first time since 1990. Its stock fell 75 percent. A shift in
its business strategy wasn't well focused, and senior managers
jumped ship in droves. Meanwhile, the search for a new chief
executive dragged on for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to its woes, the Andover, Mass. company discovered it had
improperly booked $18 million in sales and lease payments dating
back to mid-1996, triggering a spate of shareholder lawsuits. On
top of it all, PictureTel was slapped with a potentially ruinous
patent infringement suit by a Texas company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of like Murphy's Law for PictureTel last year _
one thing piled up on top of another,'' said Jason Ader, a research
analyst at H.C. Wainwright &AMP; Co. in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But the problems that have clouded PictureTel's future for more
than a year are beginning to clear with the arrival of Bruce Bond,
its new chief executive. His challenge is to put the struggling
company's strategy back into focus.
</P>
<P>
   A respected veteran of the telecommunications and Internet
industries, Bond most recently ran America Online Inc.'s networking
subsidiary. His plan is to transform PictureTel from a simple
provider of video conferencing equipment into a full-service video
communications company specializing in helping people collaborate
visually over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role PictureTel should play, as a clear leader and pioneer
in the video industry, is to help carry a light and say, `This is
how you can use this technology,''' Bond says.
</P>
<P>
   The new service-oriented strategy is winning praise from
analysts on Wall Street, including some who had left the company
for dead less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, PictureTel's stock, which traded at nearly $45 a share
three years ago, is selling for just $8 today, suggesting investors
still aren't convinced a turnaround is under way.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Bond will make his pitch directly to
shareholders today at the company's annual meeting, the first since
he became PictureTel president and chief executive in March. &UR;  &LR; He
replaced Norman Gaut, 60, who had been chief executive for 12
years. Gaut, who is still chairman of the board, was expected to
step down Wednesday. The board will then name Bond to the
additional post of chairman. Gaut, who wants to cut back his
day-to-day responsibilities, will stay on as a director.
</P>
<P>
   Bond's arrival has inspired new hope for PictureTel, which grew
rapidly in the 1990s through the sale of expensive video systems
for corporate boardrooms but stumbled badly in 1997. The video
systems allowed groups of people in different locations to see and
speak to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some real signs of life that this thing is going to
turn itself around,'' said Ader, one of several investment analysts
who had been critical of the company last fall but have recently
recommended the stock.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a huge threat facing PictureTel disappeared when it
won the patent suit brought by DataPoint Inc. But the primary
reason for Wall Street's new optimism about PictureTel is the
arrival of Bond.
</P>
<P>
   A former football star at Colorado State University, where he
studied psychology and philosophy, Bond earned an MBA from the
University of Dayton and a master's degree from the Sloan School of
Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   He was plucked from ANS, the networking unit of America Online,
after it was acquired by WorldCom Inc. last year. After long stints
with AT&AMP;T Corp., US West and British Telecom, Bond said he didn't
want to work again for a giant telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't come cheaply. Terms of his compensation package won't
be disclosed for a year, but his contract reportedly includes a
boatload of low-priced stock options that could be worth millions
if he succeeds in turning PictureTel around.
</P>
<P>
   By reining in costs, Bond has already managed to stop the
bleeding at PictureTel, and he says the company will be profitable
again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nostrils are close to the water,'' Bond said. ``As soon as
that happens, the whole psychology within the company will be
different,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Bond's leadership is having an impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seems to have PictureTel employees believing again that
their company has what it takes to be the best,'' said Ader.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all its troubles last year, PictureTel didn't lose much
ground to competitors and remains the leading provider of video
communications products and services, with more than 50 percent
market share.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the entire industry ground to a halt in 1997,
amid customer confusion about an array of new products flooding the
market, including desktop systems that allow computer users to
communicate visually. Many buyers decided they'd rather wait than
get stuck with an obsolete system, while others avoided the desktop
systems because the images were poor.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, none of PictureTel's competitors was able to take
advantage of the leader's misssteps and steal market share. The
industry has changed, however, and PictureTel can't just pick up
where it left off.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, competitors have identified a hot new segment
of the videoconferencing market _ small group systems costing less
than $10,000 each _ which could turn videoconferencing into a
mainstream business tool. &UR;  &LR; The emergence of these inexpensive
systems has hurt PictureTel, which specializes in high-end systems
that cost $20,000 to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The most aggressive of these low-end providers is Polycom Inc.
of San Jose, Calif., which, ironically, is run by Bruce Hinman, the
MIT graduate who cofounded PictureTel in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Malloy, the general manager of Polycom's video
conferencing business, says PictureTel is facing the same quandary
that Digital Equipment Corp., the leader in minicomputers, faced
when the PC revolution began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for companies like that, who are a leader in a
particular generation of technology, to make a smooth transition to
the next technology,'' Malloy said.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel has responded by introducing its own low-priced
system called SwiftSite, but its challenge is to avoid hurting
sales of its own higher-end systems, which are used by Fortune 500
companies such as Ford Motor Co. and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Bond believes video conferencing systems are becoming
inexpensive commodity items, so his solution is to diversify and
offer companies a broad array of services to help them manage their
video communications needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving away from being just a box provider,'' he said,
adding that PictureTel plans to boost its services revenue to about
50 percent of its sales, up from 14 percent now.
</P>
<P>
   Malloy said that's a typical response for a company that is
caught flat-footed by competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto is that video conferencing ought to be as easy to
set up and install as a network printer, or a fax machine or a
copier. So you don't need a big services operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond counters that companies expect their video conferencing
systems to do more for them.
</P>
<P>
   Early users of video conferencing systems saw them as an
alternative to travel, he said. This was especially true during the
Persian Gulf War, when executives were afraid to travel because of
the risk of terrorism, and helped fuel PictureTel's growth.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Bond says, companies now want their employees to be
able to collaborate visually over phone lines and the Internet.
With 14 years of experience, PictureTel can help companies achieve
these technological goals, Bond says. Investors hope he is right.

FOOD CHAINS SEEK WIDER MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   When it looked for the right recipe for its house brand of
salsa, Shaw's Supermarkets Inc. relied on customer focus groups and
blind taste tests. After much trial and error, Shaw's came up with
a mild sauce that passed muster.
</P>
<P>
   Red-hot salsa may be prized in Texas, but in the land of the
bean and the cod, consumers prefer bland dips for their snack
foods. And the peanut butter had better be just right, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't spread thick on white bread, New Englanders
don't want it,'' says Shaw's spokesman Bernie Rogan.
</P>
<P>
   Distinctive regional food tastes may partly explain why there
isn't a national supermarket chain. In this land of plenty, tastes
can vary widely, even from neighborhood to neighborhood. As a
result, the food industry has tended to be regionally fragmented,
with supermarket chains succeeding by becoming experts in the food
preferences of local consumers. Get too big, and grocers can lose
sight of what customers want.
</P>
<P>
   All that may be changing. In an industry in which profit margins
are razor thin, market forces are pushing chains to bulk up and get
more efficient. Within a few years, national grocers could emerge,
and that could have major implications for everyone, from consumers
to mom-and-pop stores. Such changes could also rearrange a local
landscape where the three biggest players are Stop &AMP; Shop
Supermarket Co. of Quincy, Mass.; Shaw's, of East Bridgewater,
Mass.; and Star Markets Co. of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   One force for change could be Wal-Mart Stores Inc. In the last
decade, Wal-Mart has charged its way into the grocery aisle. In
1997, Wal-Mart sold about $20 billion worth of food, about $6
billion behind America's largest grocer, Ohio-based Kroger Co. With
Arkansas-based Wal-Mart becoming a big food presence in the South
and Midwest, many supermarket chains want the buying clout and
efficiencies that acquisitions can bring.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, supermarkets are waging war on a second front.
Consumers now spend about half of every food dollar on takeout and
restaurant meals. A good acquisition can also help supermarkets as
they compete with these rivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four years, the $436 billion US grocery industry has
been consolidating rapidly, with more than 100 mergers or
acquisitions, says the Food Institute, an industry group. The
latest big deal: an agreement by Stop &AMP; Shop's Dutch parent, Royal
Ahold NV, to buy Giant Foods Inc., a 176-store chain based near
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   If this consolidation pace continues, America could soon look a
lot like Europe, where a few big chains rule, says Stop &AMP; Shop
chief executive William J. Grize.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a relatively short time, there will be five or six
retailers dominating our industry,'' Grize predicts. ``You're going
to see things that will make your head spin.''
</P>
<P>
   With population growth stagnant in Europe, big European players
like Ahold see US chains as good investments, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Putting together a national grocery chain may not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   For other retailers, national expansion can be a relatively
straightforward exercise, though not always easy to execute.
</P>
<P>
   A Home Depot can take its formula for a big hardware store and
replicate it from Maine to Oregon. A Staples can open big office
supply stores from coast to coast and thrive. But a cookie-cutter,
one-size-fits-all strategy might not work as well for a business
that lives and dies on knowing the salsa tastes of its local
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can sell the same legal pad in Los Angeles that you can in
New York,'' says Staples Inc. founder Thomas G. Stemberg, who once
worked at Star Market. ``But regional food tastes vary widely.
People even have different names for things. In Boston, it's tonic.
In New Jersey, it's soda. In Chicago, it's pop.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to food, consumers are also reluctant to buy from
strangers, which could explain why chains think an acquisition is a
better, and often cheaper, way to move into an unfamiliar market
than simply expanding its own stores to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a warm and fuzzy feeling about their grocer,''
says Steve Griffin, president of the Griffin Report of Food
Marketing, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing makes a food lover more warm and fuzzy than a grocer
who meticulously studies his eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   That's something A&AMP;P may have lost sight of. Thirty years ago,
the Great Atlantic &AMP; Pacific Tea Co. had 4,600 supermarkets and was
about the closest thing America had to a national chain. Now that
total is about 900. A lack of decentralization, an indifference to
customers' tastes, and an unwillingness to use new tech-nologies
were among the reasons cited for A&AMP;P's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ahold and others are using a different strategy. Seeking
to combine the best of both worlds, Ahold lets its chains keep
their identities, names, and management teams while getting more
buying clout and added efficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   By creating a network of cooperating chains rather than one big
chain with one name and store format, Ahold hopes to enjoy the
advantages of size without losing sight of local food preferences.
</P>
<P>
   When the Giant acquisition is completed, Ahold will operate US
supermarkets under seven nameplates, including Stop &AMP; Shop, Bi-Lo,
and Tops.

SOCIETAL, LEGAL CHANGES ARE LEGACIES OF A PUBLIC TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Louise Woodward case was Massachusetts'
contribution to the media phenomenon of the '90s _ the televised
trial as meeting place for public grievances.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a forensic whodunit, dense with dueling medical
experts, became a local equivalent of the O.J. Simpson case, a
prism through which people projected their own anxieties onto those
wrestling with the law. And, like the Simpson case, there is a
civil trial yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   Where the Simpson trial featured spousal abuse, the Woodward
trial featured child abuse. Where Simpson spotlighted race,
Woodward spotlighted class. And when the criminal trial ended, with
a rapid series of legal somersaults, this case _ like Simpson's _
left lingering concerns about whether television, with its
magnifying effect, is distorting the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``These events are often a seamless web of spectacle and
tutorial,'' observed Ralph Whitehead, journalism professor at the
University of MassachusettsTuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Show trials can stimulate viewers to reflect on issues that
otherwise rarely enter the public discourse _ in this case, the
difficulties of working parents in securing affordable and reliable
day care.
</P>
<P>
   Television can also blow open the courthouse doors and reveal
uncomfortable truths about the justice system _ in this case, the
vagaries of decision-making by prosecutors, defense lawyers, and
judges, and how they can alter the outcome of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, serious discourse can quickly devolve into
Jerry Springer-like name-calling, stirring up ignorance or even
prejudice in the guise of man-on-the-street opinions _ in this
case, some extreme views on working women's duties to their
children or the irresponsible nature of young women.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's trial rang up the highest ratings of the year on
Court TV in the United States, and it became a prime-time
attraction in Woodward's native England. Playing in 3 million homes
a night, the trial came across to Britons as the railroading of an
innocent girl; one poll revealed that an astonishing 98 percent of
the country believed that Woodward was innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist, a British magazine, noted, ``England is the home
of Mary Poppins; Massachusetts is the scene of the Salem
witch-hunts; and so the televised trial of an English au pair in
Massachusetts played on potent stereotypes from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   But what cultural footprints, if any, will be left after this
event? Much grief was aired. Little was settled. There is no
consensus on Woodward's culpability. Nor is there a definitive view
of who was more poorly served by the legal process, Woodward or
Deborah and Sunil Eappen, the parents of the baby who died under
Woodward's care. The British aren't even sure whether to be
appalled by the tawdriness of the US justice system _ or to put
their own trials on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the president of EF Au Pair, the Cambridge company that
arranged Woodward's placement in the Eappens' home, says the case
brought about major changes in the way au pairs are trained. Echoes
of the hubbub surrounding the case can still be heard in Congress,
where tax credits to help parents pay for childcare remains on a
short list of policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   And in the State House, some observers insist that the case's
greatest legacy is in prompting a statewide change of heart on the
death penalty after the murder of 11-year-old Jeffrey Curley stoked
support. Two days before the Woodward verdict, the House voted to
institute capital punishment, overcoming concerns that innocent
people might be found guilty of murder and executed. Then came the
jury's vote to convict Woodward of second-degree murder, even
though millions of trial-watchers insisted she was innocent. The
House reversed itself a week later.
</P>
<P>
   ``People involved in lobbying (against) the death penalty called
here to say they wanted to thank Louise,'' said one of her lawyers,
Harvey Silverglate. Although only one legislator changed his vote
because of Woodward, many others were prepared to do so if
necessary, Silverglate said. ``This case changed more than one
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Execution was never a possibility for Woodward, but her
conviction exposed a fragility in the criminal law that weakened
the argument for harsh, irreversible punishment. After all, if the
system were capable of neatly separating the wrongdoers from the
wrongly accused, how could so many people watch Woodward's trial
and come away with differing views of her guilt?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people thought she was innocent _ she got a raw deal,''
explained George Katsinis, a waiter at the Sweet Touch restaurant
across from the courthouse on Cambridge Street, which served
throngs of trial watchers. ``But it didn't start out that way _ it
turned about halfway through. Then when she got the light sentence
it turned again. People were upset about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Katsinis could look out the front window of the
Sweet Touch and see streets clogged with TV-news trucks and
sidewalks filled with sign-waving protesters. The crowd outside the
courthouse thickened daily, drawn by outrage _ several types of
outrage. Some people were inflamed by Woodward's alleged offense _
shaking to death a baby who had been in her care. Others, convinced
there was little evidence linking Woodward to the baby's death,
were incensed over Middlesex District Attorney Thomas Reilly's
decision to charge her with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike famous trials of the past _ from Alfred Dreyfus in France
to the Rosenbergs' prosecution for treason in the US _ today's TV
trials aren't simply about judging the accused. TV plays off the
audience. TV trials soak up, like sponges, the vagrant attitudes of
their onlookers. The rendering of justice becomes something more
than an individual denouement: It becomes America's day in court.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those fascinated by the Woodward case had strong
feelings about working mothers, and applied them to Dr. Deborah
Eappen, the baby's mother, an ophthalmologist who saw patients
three days a week. To some who followed the trial at home during
the day _ a group that inevitably included many stay-at-home
mothers and paid nannies _ Deborah Eappen became a symbol for a
generation of women who had, in their view, sacrificed homemaking
for the personal gratification of careers.

MULAN IS A NEW SPIN FOR DISNEY ANIMATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For too long, Disney just didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   After its animation rebirth via 1989's The Little Mermaid, the
studio lived on film after film about plucky heroines and heroes
seeking true love in musical adventures inevitably spiced with one
big Busby Berkeley-style production number.
</P>
<P>
   Can you spell formulaic? Many filmgoers could, and Disney's
animated fare, while consistently lavish, began getting diminishing
returns.
</P>
<P>
   But while A-team animators in Burbank, Calif., toiled on
Hercules and The Hunchback of Notre Dame _ whose respectable $100
million grosses trailed far behind their predecessors' _ the B-team
at Disney's newer Florida studio launched a lesser project.
</P>
<P>
   Intended as a direct-to-video effort, this project soon evolved
into a major movie _ and a welcome breath of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   That movie is Mulan, a new spin for Disney animation that opens
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan is Disney's first animated feature created primarily by
its Florida artists, who often labor under the humiliating gazes of
tourists in windowed studios at Orlando's Disney-MGM Studio Theme
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan (pronounced moo-lahn) also is Disney's first animated
feature focusing solely on Asian characters. It's the first with
songs from the team of Matthew Wilder and David Zippel, who
maintain the Broadway style of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman but
add a contemporary pop-rock edge _ and sidestep the Busby Berkeley
number.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mulan contains hardly a hint of romance. Boy meets girl
isn't the essence. History is.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan's title character is a heroine of ancient Chinese
folklore. She disguises herself as a man to take her father's place
in the imperial army when Huns invade their country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to see the girl save the guy and not really need
him,'' said Ming-Na Wen, who gives speaking voice to Mulan. (Lea
Salonga of Aladdin provides the singing.) ``He's the one who comes
running to her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy'' isn't Mulan's father but Shang, an army leader who
must whip Mulan and other recruits into shape. Shang is given voice
by B.D. Wong (Father of the Bride), with pop star Donny Osmond
handling the singing.
</P>
<P>
   While he's always taken his sons to see Disney films, Osmond is
heartened by Mulan's new approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my second song was cut, I was so disappointed,'' he said.
``It would have been a romantic duet between Shang and Mulan. But
having seen the film, I'm so glad they cut the love interest and
gave Mulan her independence.''
</P>
<P>
   Composer Wilder previously produced No Doubt's Tragic Kingdom, a
1997 Grammy nominee for best rock album. Lyricist Zippel also wrote
the words for Menken's Go the Distance from Hercules, a 1997 Oscar
nominee for best original song.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan's instrumental score is by veteran Jerry Goldsmith, an
Oscar winner for The Omen.
</P>
<P>
   Wen, who also starred in The Joy Luck Club, was born in Macao, a
Portuguese colony off China's southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
   Her family moved to America when she was 4, but she grew up
``with very traditional Chinese parents, and my mother used to tell
me about Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulan's story is as familiar in China as tales of Pocahontas and
Joan of Arc in Western countries.
</P>
<P>
   Wen said Disney ``has made a great deal of effort not to stray
too far from the original story,'' which she called ``part folklore
and part history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Mushu (a small, impish dragon voiced by Eddie Murphy)
and the bug (a good-luck cricket named Cri-Kee) didn't exist, but
that's a Disney thing,'' she said. ``Overall, the story is very
true, and I don't think any Chinese will be offended by the
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulan gained authenticity when Disney dumped its plans to make
it a romance like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast,
Pocahontas and its other recent films.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they wanted that relationship,'' Wen said. ``But then
they went back to the original story. It's nice that they realized
this story lasted thousands of years because of its content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Disney took some license,'' Osmond said. ``But I
believe this is true to the Chinese folklore. Mulan conquers
adversity. That's a great story to show kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmond came into the project almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   He'd auditioned for the title voice of Hercules ``and really,
really wanted that gig, because I'd always wanted to do a Disney
film. But they said my voice was too low for the part. They wanted
someone younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmond, 40, got a call months later saying his voice was similar
to Wong's and asking whether he'd like to sing for the male lead of
Mulan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, ``Are you kidding me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Wen isn't bothered by a non-Asian actor's contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just grateful Disney went out of their way to cast as many
Asians as they did,'' she said. ``They didn't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Actors of Asian ancestry speak in many other roles, including
George Takei of Star Trek fame as the First Ancestor and Pat Morita
of the Karate Kid films as the Emperor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something has a certain ethnic background, I do think you
should cast people with that background,'' Wen said. ``It brings an
innate sensibility to the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if they find voices to better represent a character, you
can't stop them from that creative choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulan also gave Disney a chance to expand its artistic palette.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Disney, chairman of Disney Feature Animation and nephew of
the late Walt Disney, said the Chinese locale provided ``a whole
new set of cultural references and artistic influences in a setting
we had never been to before.''
</P>
<P>
   In preproduction, animation supervisors spent three weeks in
China to study, photograph and sketch the country.
</P>
<P>
   The coming-of-age theme from a female perspective also sparked
Disney's creative team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very exciting challenge for us not to do a love story
but something unique,'' said Peter Schneider, president of Disney
Feature Animation.
</P>
<P>
   Wen said Mulan's ancient tale shows that female liberation isn't
new to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese women are extremely liberated,'' she said. ``China's
history is so full of changes, because it's such a large country.
There was a period of time when women were equal in battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ironic that this 2,000-year-old legend represents such
modern ideals. Maybe the Chinese knew better about what was going
on back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Osmond, who starred for almost six years in a touring production
of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, is excited about
Mulan's prospects on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine what they'd do with this on Broadway in a few
years?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he and Wen delight in a film that's emerged as
what Osmond calls ``the silent monster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of this project,'' Wen said. ``It will be one of
those things I can look back on one day and say, `Yes, I was a part
of that' _ and say it with pride.''

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO, Calif. _ I come from a country where God is the
deciding factor in which neighborhood a newborn baby will first see
the ray of light.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon was not even Jesus' birthplace, or Mohammad's key
geographical point to conquer, nor by any means Buddha's idea of a
serene place. But in that tiny country whose main economy thrived
once on the benevolence of open-handed tourists, religion has taken
the form of a dangerous country club.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Lebanese accuse the Muslims of choosing God above
country, and the Muslim Lebanese, baffled that anyone would not
choose God first and foremost, accuse the Christians of worshipping
France.
</P>
<P>
   France is the nation that formerly colonized Lebanon and taught
its Christians how to flaunt.
</P>
<P>
   Our flag contains the symbol of the cedar, which historically
has helped build a Jewish temple, never mind that the country it
represents is at odds with the Israeli people.
</P>
<P>
   We have no famous mosques or cathedrals whose steeples pierce
the clouds, but on our grounds we still fight the noble cause of
how best to worship God: standing, kneeling or bending.
</P>
<P>
   And then comes Syria, which so believes in love-thy-neighbor
that it managed to roll through our country with tanks filled with
construction workers. Syria, it seems, suffers from a perpetual
unemployment crisis and has found in God-torn Lebanon a perfect
place to build condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, on our southern border, employs Christian Lebanese
youths as their human shields from attacks by Muslim Lebanese
youths whom Iran employs as their human bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Within each religion, of course, is a ruling faction.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese Maronites and the Muslim Shiites love their country
to death, and each feuding side can claim ancestors whose blood was
spilled on that same spot where rivers irrigate olive trees which
are the symbol of peace for both religions.
</P>
<P>
   We, the Lebanese, don't have much to show on Earth for our
religious fighting, but, when we meet our maker, we are hoping for
a special place in our Father's heavenly kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Yup, the time-out place he reserves for naughty children.

FREEDOM IS NOT HONG KONG'S WORRY _ IT'S THE ECONOMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A year ago, as Britain handed over Hong Kong to China,
the conventional wisdom was that the territory's civic freedom
would be in trouble but its economy unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   That was exactly backward. Today the scorecard on Hong Kong
reads: civic freedom, unaffected; economy, in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong leaders appeared in Seattle this week at a conference
sponsored by the Asia Society and the Washington State China
Relations Council. They answered the predictable (and appropriate)
questions about freedom. The Hong Kong people's freedom to
assemble, publish, vote, worship, transact business and do many
other things depends entirely on the promises of China. In the past
11 months, those promises have been entirely reliable. Amazing,
perhaps _ but there it is.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news has come on the economic side. Hong Kong has caught
the new Asian flu, and not from its mother country. The fever seems
to peak in a different country each month, currently Japan. Anson
Chan, the No. 2 official in the Hong Kong government and the
highest-ranked holdover from the British administration, said
Monday that the plunge in the yen-dollar rate to 146 was
``extremely worrying.'' She told the Post-Intelligencer she expects
no Asian revival ``until and unless the Japanese economy picks
up,'' and added, ``We hope that Japan will show some leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Fung, chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council
(a conference co-sponsor), said Tuesday he was ``really concerned''
about Japan. A hint of leadership from the Bank of Japan pushed the
yen-dollar rate to 142, but Fung was worrying about a pullback by
Japan's banks. ``Japanese banks provide about half of the foreign
loans in Asia,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, credit is tightening in Asia, and is virtually
unobtainable in Indonesia. ``If you go to Indonesia and contract
for some garments, the supplier will have a hard time delivering,''
he said in an interview. The fall in Indonesia's currency would
seem to help that garment maker, except that the banks have shut
off dollar credits. The garment maker needs dollar credits to
import fabric.
</P>
<P>
   If the yen-dollar rate passes 150, Fung said, it will put
pressure on the South Korean won. That in turn will pressure the
Taiwan dollar and threaten ``another round of competitive
devaluations in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mudslide of devaluations, China has been the bedrock.
Fung, whose private-sector interests include Hong Kong's big Li &AMP;
Fung trading house with a long interest in China, said, ``Renminbi
(China's currency) will hold.'' Many in Hong Kong worry it won't,
citing warnings by Chinese officials about the slide of the yen.
But Fung says China does not compete directly with Japan in most of
the things it sells, and is undercut less than Korea or Taiwan by a
falling yen.
</P>
<P>
   And Hong Kong? Its dollar has been pegged at 7.8 to the U.S.
dollar since 1983 _ and pegged in stone, with a currency board
backed up by $97 billion in reserves. The Hong Kong dollar will
hold, too, Fung said. (As did Anson Chan. She said her government's
commitment to the peg is ``absolute,'' adding, ``We have the
unequivocal support of the sovereign power.'')
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's pegged currency puts it in the same position as
gold-standard economies of a century ago. ``Rather than adjusting
to the downturn through changes in currency value,'' said Fung to
the conference Tuesday, ``our economy is doing so through
asset-price depreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index recently fell below the level of the
Dow Jones industrials for the first time in decades. And the price
of condominiums, where the top half lives, is off 40 percent in the
past year. Prices of standard units in each building are posted in
neighborhood real estate offices like stock quotations, and are
closely followed.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 percent drop, says Fung, ``reflects an economy that's
very efficient. Contrast that with Japan, which has been trying for
eight years to go into a recession in slow motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's no-safety-net economy will snap back fast. But it
falls fast, too, and the prospect of another drop is not so
welcome. Last week, condo buyers who owe more on their mortgages
than their flats are worth demanded government subsidies.
Unemployment has risen to 4.2 percent, and some of the laid-off are
demanding unemployment compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's elites do not want to open this Rooseveltian box.
Government at all levels eats up 18 percent to 19 percent of the
economy _ roughly half the level in the United States. Hong Kong
has a Steve Forbes-style flat tax with a top rate of 15 percent,
compared with a middle rate of 28 percent here. ``We intend to keep
government small,'' says Chan.
</P>
<P>
   That resolve will be tested _ by Hong Kong's legislators, who
are tending toward populism, and by Asia's economic storm, which is
not over.

GLOBAL RAGE AGAINST GLOBALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARCO A. MANGELSDORF  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ What began as a peaceful protest ended with riot police
waging pitched battles with brick-throwing, sledgehammer-wielding
looters. Storefronts were shattered and shops were ransacked as
cars were overturned and demolished.
</P>
<P>
   I saw this scene repeated over several days as rioters perfected
their hit-and-run tactics to elude security forces and volleys of
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Jakarta? No, Geneva, the heart of normally placid and
heretofore predictably stable Switzerland. Asked why he was
involved, one 32-year-old physical education teacher explained: ``I
need to express myself. I came to support those peoples oppressed
by the power of money. Violence bothers me, but it's the only way I
found to be heard. It's an act of desperation and anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this series of demonstrations and subsequent
violence is not dissatisfaction with a corrupt or oppressive
government.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the natives suffering from food shortages or other
economic deprivations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in this exemplar city of global finance and
international organizations, people in the streets were raging
against the principles and practices of the World Trade
Organization and a recent conference here attended by dozens of
world leaders, including President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Smashing windows and battling police on account of the WTO, an
organization dedicated to global free trade? What is going on here
and why should we care?
</P>
<P>
   We should be concerned about this old, yet enduring Emerald
City-like vision of the great benefits and riches coming from
unfettered economic exchange. It is prompting a growing number of
detractors to question, if not oppose, unrestricted trade and the
forces of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   From the left-leaning anti-capitalists in the streets of Geneva
and other European and Canadian cities to the American hodgepodge
of liberal academics, environmentalists and Pat Buchanan nativists,
these differing ideologies share a common suspicion and fear of a
Daimler-Benz-Chrysler, Volkswagen-Rolls Royce,
NationsBank-BankAmerica, United-Delta juggernaut crushing all in
its way.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, free-trade phobics see the unhindered movement of goods,
services and capital across borders as jeopardizing workers'
rights, accelerating consumption of finite natural resources,
threatening small entrepreneurs and shop owners, and promoting
profits over people.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and Canada, workers fear the loss of their
jobs to the cheap labor markets of Asia and Latin America while
environmentalists worry about big businesses voraciously gobbling
up natural resources and increased pollution in countries with less
strict waste and conservation standards.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where activists march against American symbols like
McDonald's and Pizza Hut, there is concern that the growing sales
and profits of these and other transnational corporations do
little, if anything, to help the people at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the poverty experienced by the more than 2 billion
souls in the developing world represent a threat to international
stability as people surviving at the edge in region after region
agitate for a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Across national borders, the perception that important decisions
affecting local, regional and even national affairs are being made
in distant boardrooms feeds the belief that what's good for
corporate executives and shareholders is not necessarily good for
the common folk.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, a widely held
vision has endured: An open, competitive market that leads to a
rising tide of material prosperity that lifts all boats.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a unifying, overall strategy of America's role
in the world, which we had during the more black-and-white Cold War
years, Washington has promoted the idea of turning the globe into
one big free-trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   The rumblings of discontent from many quarters show serious
concern over just who stands to gain from all this capital
mobility, increased trade and consumption, and merger mania.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics _ whether they make their stand on the need to
secure the rights of indigenous labor, safeguard the environment or
do more to eliminate poverty _ are united in their unease.
</P>
<P>
   Going full speed ahead without adequately dealing with these
concerns imperils an intrinsically sound vision that, with some
refinements, could improve peoples' lives from Geneva to Jakarta
and beyond.

day. But when he died, what he did for a living was still something
of a mystery to my sisters and me. Like many dads of the era,
especially those with daughters, he didn't talk about his work

   EURO-BANKNOTE-DESIGN (Undated) _ About a month ago, as
preparations began for printing the 10 billion new Euro banknotes
that will replace the familiar currencies of most European nations
by the end of 2001, a French-made anti-counterfeiting hologram
vanished. Officials speculated that it had been stolen by
well-informed thieves who understood the significance of the
device. An alternative theory is that the hologram was snatched by
an unhappy esthete who understands the damage the Euro banknotes
will do to the continent's reputation as a place where the design
of everyday things has a high priority. By Karrie Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER-LIGHTS (Undated) _ It's true that everything looks better
by candlelight. Besides, it beats eating in the dark. But there are
hazards: there has been a recall of 30,000 fuel canisters called
Summer Lights by the Conros Corp. of Toronto in cooperation with
the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These plastic canisters for
outdoor bamboo torches can cause the bamboo poles to ignite. There
is a new, safer Tiki light: a 67-inch tall stainless steel model
with a fiberglass wick, which comes with a refillable canister. It
sells at $70 from the Williams Sonoma catalogue. By Marianne
Rohrlich.
</P>
<P>
   DESIGN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Back in the 1930s, the running joke
among young architects in the office of Richard Neutra, the apostle
of modernism, was: ``What is the best material to build a steel
house of?'' To judge by a new steel-and-glass addition to a
just-restored Neutra house in Santa Monica, it's taken about 60
years for technology to catch up with his vision. By Joseph
Giovannini.

GLOBAL RAGE AGAINST GLOBALIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARCO A. MANGELSDORF  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ What began as a peaceful protest ended with riot police
waging pitched battles with brick-throwing, sledgehammer-wielding
looters. Storefronts were shattered and shops were ransacked as
cars were overturned and demolished.
</P>
<P>
   I saw this scene repeated over several days as rioters perfected
their hit-and-run tactics to elude security forces and volleys of
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Jakarta? No, Geneva, the heart of normally placid and
heretofore predictably stable Switzerland. Asked why he was
involved, one 32-year-old physical education teacher explained: ``I
need to express myself. I came to support those peoples oppressed
by the power of money. Violence bothers me, but it's the only way I
found to be heard. It's an act of desperation and anger.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this series of demonstrations and subsequent
violence is not dissatisfaction with a corrupt or oppressive
government.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the natives suffering from food shortages or other
economic deprivations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in this exemplar city of global finance and
international organizations, people in the streets were raging
against the principles and practices of the World Trade
Organization and a recent conference here attended by dozens of
world leaders, including President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Smashing windows and battling police on account of the WTO, an
organization dedicated to global free trade? What is going on here
and why should we care?
</P>
<P>
   We should be concerned about this old, yet enduring Emerald
City-like vision of the great benefits and riches coming from
unfettered economic exchange. It is prompting a growing number of
detractors to question, if not oppose, unrestricted trade and the
forces of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   From the left-leaning anti-capitalists in the streets of Geneva
and other European and Canadian cities to the American hodgepodge
of liberal academics, environmentalists and Pat Buchanan nativists,
these differing ideologies share a common suspicion and fear of a
Daimler-Benz-Chrysler, Volkswagen-Rolls Royce,
NationsBank-BankAmerica, United-Delta juggernaut crushing all in
its way.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, free-trade phobics see the unhindered movement of goods,
services and capital across borders as jeopardizing workers'
rights, accelerating consumption of finite natural resources,
threatening small entrepreneurs and shop owners, and promoting
profits over people.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and Canada, workers fear the loss of their
jobs to the cheap labor markets of Asia and Latin America while
environmentalists worry about big businesses voraciously gobbling
up natural resources and increased pollution in countries with less
strict waste and conservation standards.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, where activists march against American symbols like
McDonald's and Pizza Hut, there is concern that the growing sales
and profits of these and other transnational corporations do
little, if anything, to help the people at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the poverty experienced by the more than 2 billion
souls in the developing world represent a threat to international
stability as people surviving at the edge in region after region
agitate for a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Across national borders, the perception that important decisions
affecting local, regional and even national affairs are being made
in distant boardrooms feeds the belief that what's good for
corporate executives and shareholders is not necessarily good for
the common folk.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of Adam Smith and David Ricardo, a widely held
vision has endured: An open, competitive market that leads to a
rising tide of material prosperity that lifts all boats.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a unifying, overall strategy of America's role
in the world, which we had during the more black-and-white Cold War
years, Washington has promoted the idea of turning the globe into
one big free-trade zone.
</P>
<P>
   The rumblings of discontent from many quarters show serious
concern over just who stands to gain from all this capital
mobility, increased trade and consumption, and merger mania.
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics _ whether they make their stand on the need to
secure the rights of indigenous labor, safeguard the environment or
do more to eliminate poverty _ are united in their unease.
</P>
<P>
   Going full speed ahead without adequately dealing with these
concerns imperils an intrinsically sound vision that, with some
refinements, could improve peoples' lives from Geneva to Jakarta
and beyond.

LIVING AMONG GOLFERS, DEVELOPERS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There's not much you can say about taking a cold
and cloudy week's vacation in San Diego (actually, at the in-laws'
place in Escondido), then returning to a hot and sunny San
Francisco overrun by golfers.
</P>
<P>
   El Nino has tipped the West Coast upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The golfers will go away, but Los Angeles power brokers may be
taking over a big new chunk of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   While I was away we found out what Mayor Willie Brown hid behind
the toilet paper curtain on Treasure Island. Pieces of eight,
pieces of eight, pieces of eight. And they just might go to a Los
Angeles supermarket millionaire, a leading Friend of Willie.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago Brown blew up and said the San Francisco
Examiner wasn't fit to use as toilet paper after I wrote a column
on restricted access to the island. Obviously, something was up
besides the mayor's blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The other handmade Italian shoe finally dropped. Last week, the
Examiner reported on Treasure Island Enterprises, which was formed
at the beginning of this year and proposes to build a marina,
condos and commercial operations, including a dining, wedding and
special-event destination.
</P>
<P>
   What is this, the Chapel of Love and Canapes?
</P>
<P>
   That would be a special-event destination brought to you by
special people indeed. Access to the island? Well, the old saying
is that political contributions buy access.
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Island Enterprises is run by Brown fund-raiser Darius
Anderson and Los Angeles supermarket magnate Ron Burkle, who has
been one of Brown's law clients and contributed $100,000 toward the
U.S. Mayor's Conference, which was held in San Francisco last year.
Their lobbyist is Billy Rutland, a close friend to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors could exert
some control over who gets the treasure on Treasure Island if they
vote to enact Proposition K, which was approved by voters two weeks
ago to wrest control of the island from the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. As my wife says, ``Some cities have supermodels. San
Francisco has supervisors.''
</P>
<P>
   This is their chance to be model supervisors and earn their
handsome new salaries passed by the voters.
</P>
<P>
   What else did I miss? So what if Willie Brown has a penchant for
hiring good-looking staffers, and his scheduling secretary has a
Web site featuring sexy photographs of herself?
</P>
<P>
   Brown's policy of hiring the beautiful extends to men (check out
his bodyguards or aide-de-everything Stuart Sunshine). And if
Willie had a Web site, imagine the pictures he'd post of himself.
Of course, the world is Willie's Web, or as he said a couple of
weeks ago, ``I am my own Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, out there in hand-tailored fiberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up megalomania and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, who has been running off at the mouth himself a lot.
</P>
<P>
   He said that homosexuality is a sin and gays should be assisted
in dealing with it ``just like alcohol ... or sex addiction ... or
kleptomaniacs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kleptomaniacs? Where did he get that one? I guess senators look
down on kleptomaniacs as amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   Is homophobia an existing condition or will your HMO treat it?
And how do we deal with a problem like Trent Lott? Too bad they
haven't invented Brainagra yet.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., seems to have caught something from Pat
Robertson, who went wild a week ago and said God would smite
Orlando, Fla., with terrorist bombs, earthquakes, tornadoes,
hurricanes ``and possibly a meteor'' for flying rainbow flags to
greet gays going to Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, Pat, and God will send plagues of bugs, snakes,
alligators, fundamentalists, rednecks, retirees and tourists in bad
shorts, too. How can a meteor hurt a town that develops giant
Porsche-swallowing craters all on its own?

</P>
<P>
   All right, so I came back a little bitter from my cloudy San
Diego vacation and now I'm doing some easy gay-basher-bashing and
Willie-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   You know the West Coast is really upside down when your trip
from the Bay Area to San Diego County was a food pilgrimage. I
caught a 13.2-pound yellowtail. No fish tale. One hunk of it right
out of the Pacific, and that's it for fish in restaurants ever
again.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the pilgrimage part. The pilgrimage was a trip to
Del Mar to find the Chino Ranch. First off, never trust a fruit
stand that plays classical music.
</P>
<P>
   A few pieces of sugar-and-butter corn, two baskets of cherry
tomatoes, some beans, Brussels sprouts, onions and strawberries
from French seeds _ and what does the young woman who looks like a
fine arts major say?
</P>
<P>
   She said: ``That'll be $31, please.''
</P>
<P>
   We'd walked into a foodie trap, and were too embarrassed to ask
for an accounting.
</P>
<P>
   It all was great, though _ the finest corn this side of roadside
stands in New England, and the finest strawberries this side of
France, I guess. Or maybe that's just me having a bad case of
cognoscenti cognitive dissonance.

AT OLYMPIC CLUB, BIG HITTERS TO GIVE DRIVERS A REST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Titanium and muscles being what they are in
1998, the 288-yard seventh hole of the Olympic Club's Lake Course
would seem to be but a drive and a putt away from the 156 U.S. Open
contestants.
</P>
<P>
   Caution and patience being what they are in this particular week
of 1998, player after player stepped to the tee during practice
rounds with but an iron in his hand. Instead of charging up the
hill to the green, the world's best tiptoed through the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Darren Clarke, the 6-foot-2-inch, 225-pound Irishman,
brandishing his driver and attacking the hole for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   A real man he? Nope, just a momentary lapse into foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I hit driver onto the green,'' Clarke said. ``But I
probably wouldn't hit it in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is at the U.S. Open this year, where the world's biggest
hitters are leaving their drivers in their golf bags. Clarke says
he'll likely use his no more than three times when the tournament
begins Thursday; Tiger Woods sounds like he's good for maybe only
two, at the first and 17th holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hit your driver here,'' Woods said. ``You really can.
If you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can if your driver will launch a shot high enough into
the air that it will not run through the Lake Course's meandering
fairways into the clumpy rough. You can if you don't hit your
driver very far. You can if you're inclined toward momentary lapses
into foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do, you have got to shape it into the slopes, because
the fairways are running,'' Woods warned.
</P>
<P>
   Woods averages 294.9 yards off the tee, Fred Couples 290;
they're close runners-up to John Daly, holding the lead as ever at
297. And because those are average figures, you know these sweet
swingers are hammering out 300-plus-yard drives about as often as
not.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA is so concerned that this kind of range could render
golf courses and records obsolete, it has been considering putting
a lid on technology. After all, imagine what would happen in
baseball should Mark McGwire be allowed to hit any kind of ball he
wanted with any kind of bat an engineer could dream up.
</P>
<P>
   Though length does not a champion make, even the longest-driving
golfers concede that the USGA has a point of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they decide, it's all right with me,'' Couples said.
``They're pretty bright, it's not like it's just on a whim and
people are shooting 58s and 59s. Their decision will be well
thought out, and I don't think they're going to all of a sudden say
you can't use a driver, you can't use a 60-degree wedge. They might
do something with the ball, I don't know, and I have no problem
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Here at the Lake Course, particularly this week, the USGA and
Olympic Club superintendent John Fleming have shown that it is
possible to design around the Big Berthas and King Cobras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to put the driver in their hands as often as
possible,'' said USGA agronomist Tim Moraghan. ``And, yes, I think
there is enough evidence that the players are stronger; equipment
is better and turf conditions obviously are a lot better, which
allow the ball to go farther.
</P>
<P>
   ``But where do you draw the line? Do you have 510-, 515-yard
par-4s? I don't know. ... You have to understand, (the Open) being
open to everybody, not everybody hits it 320 yards. There are
players that hit it 245. You want to have the entire field be able
to have an opportunity to win the national Open.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, the fairways are so narrow that it is hard to keep a
line drive out of the rough. And the rough is so long, it's hard to
put a shot on the green coming out of it. Even the sand is softer,
to preclude its use as a refuge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This golf course demands accuracy off the tee, not necessarily
distance,'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Clarke _ or anyone who wants to win the tournament
_ is unlikely to reach for the green from the seventh tee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anyone going for 7, because there is really no
point,'' Woods said. ``There is no place to bail out ... it makes
no sense.''
</P>

</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the bombers aren't complaining. Mostly, they're raving.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of what it's all about,'' Couples said. ``They
pick the best courses, and the Olympic Club is one of my all-time
favorite _ and they set it up so it's harder than normal but it
really is fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to go out there and play each hole with perfect
shots, you just can't hit it wild _ which I do at times, but I
can't just say I hate the course because I hit it in the rough. I
mean, I hate the course if they make it ridiculous like it's
miniature golf. But they don't do that. What they do is make tight
fairways and high rough and tight greens. And I wish more people
would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every week, though. The sluggers just have to cut loose once
in a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we did this every week,'' Couples said, ``we would just go
crazy.''

   WEST STOCKBRIDGE, Mass. _ The first thing you see are the four
oak casks along the wall in the shop, two on each side of the
coal-burning stove, resting on their sides at hip level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't use,'' reads the sign above the spout on one of the
barrels, ``the vanilla is still aging.''
</P>
<P>
   The vanilla extract has been in the cask for three weeks. It was
transferred there from a similar-looking barrel in the basement of
Charles H. Baldwin &AMP; Sons, where it had been aging for 24 hours
following a 10-day percolating process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to age the vanilla for at least three months before we
bottle it,'' explained Earl Baldwin Moffatt, the fifth generation
of Baldwins to make and sell extracts at the family's old-timey
general store. ``But at the rate we're selling the vanilla these
days, we haven't been able to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We insist on letting it sit for at least a month, though. If
we don't let it sit at least that long, it's really not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret may be in the aging process, because Baldwin vanilla
is not like most extracts found in supermarkets (even though it's
comparably priced). It is noticeably thicker than its competitors,
a deeper amber color, and it has a nutty aroma that comes from
sitting in barrels that are more than 75 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The oak casks are no older than the copper distillery in the
general store's basement. The electronically heated cylindrical
still, used to percolate the Madagascar vanilla beans, ethyl
alcohol and water through the first 10 days of the extracting
process, is the original one employed by Henry Baldwin and his son
Charles when they began making vanilla in the Center Street shop in
1920.
</P>
<P>
   It has been producing vanilla, the magical flavoring agent for
bakers and dessert makers, ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried other vanillas and there's no comparison. The aging
in the oak casks imparts a really good flavor to the vanilla,''
said Matt White, owner of Berkshire Ice Cream, also in West
Stockbridge. ``Their vanilla is far superior to anything else
that's out there.''
</P>
<P>
   White credits the Baldwin vanilla for giving his ice cream the
edge when it won first place in a competition held last year in
Boston. Taking second and third places were Ben &AMP; Jerry's and
Haagen-Dazs, the top-selling premium ice-creams in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of people tell me they don't like vanilla ice
cream,'' White added, ``but then they'll try ours and say they like
it. The difference has to be the vanilla.''
</P>
<P>
   White buys up to 10 gallons of vanilla extract a month. There
are scores of bakers and chefs throughout the country who know
about the aged vanilla at Baldwin &AMP; Sons and purchase it wholesale.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Moffatt, Earl's wife, runs the business. She stepped in
as manager in 1992 when Dick Moffatt, great-grandson of the
founder, decided at age 76 that he was ready to retire. Earl, who
was West Stockbridge's highway superintendent for 10 years, is an
equipment operator for a contractor. He helps out on weekends and
whenever Jackie needs help moving large batches of vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   A former school administrator in the Berkshires, Jackie has been
learning on the job. In addition to overseeing vanilla production,
she maintains a hectic schedule in the back half of the store that
she fondly refers to as ``the lab.''
</P>
<P>
   There, using glass beakers and vials that appear to be as old as
the still in the basement, she mixes and bottles the other extracts
that Baldwin &AMP; Sons have been selling for the past 110 years:
almond extract, lemon, orange, peppermint, rum flavor and
spearmint, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a chemist without a chemistry degree,'' she said with a
laugh. ``Our bread and butter is the vanilla, but the family
tradition has been to carry a wide variety of extracts, so we
continue to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition is a key ingredient at the Baldwin store. The
founder's edict was simple and to the point: Never tamper with the
recipe or use inferior beans. Jackie adheres to that commandment.
That's why she continues to use vanilla beans from Madagascar, even
though they are the most expensive in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The vanilla bean is actually the fruit of a tropical orchid, the
only orchid that produces an edible fruit. It is produced in other
parts of the world, but the Baldwin business is partial to the
Madagascar variety. Moffatt has sampled beans from Tahiti, but
found them too floral.
</P>
<P>
   When Henry's son, Charles, decided in the early 1900s to focus
his energies on the extract business, the item most in demand was
sarsaparilla. His son, Earl, grandfather of current owner Earl
Baldwin Moffatt, earned a pharmacist's degree as he continued the
family business.
</P>
<P>
   Little seems to have changed inside the store since then.
Nostalgic toys like wooden yo-yos, jacks and tops line the shelves,
as well as compasses and slide rules. A humongous steel cash
register, circa 1920, is still functioning. One display case lets
you know the store also caters to tourists and cooks. It contains a
wide variety of spices, including marjoram and ground poppy seed.
</P>
<P>
   There's a door in the basement at ground level. It's next to the
still, and it opens on to a picturesque view of the Williams River.
Moffatt often keeps it open this time of year to watch the fly
fishermen pursue trout while she makes vanilla, 25 gallons at a
time, the still constantly going.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to figure out a way to get (the still) upstairs where
customers can see it, because it really is a conversation piece,''
she said. ``As our business continues to grow, we're hoping to make
a new still that will produce 100 gallons of vanilla at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we stay with the same recipe and keep using the
Madagascar beans, we can't go wrong. Even with a new still we have
the 75-year-old barrels that we'll use to age the vanilla.''

RESEARCHER SAYS AIDS DRUGS DON'T LIVE UP TO HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After two years of high hopes for new
AIDS-fighting drugs, a letdown is likely at the upcoming
international AIDS conference, a top expert warns.
</P>
<P>
   The much-ballyhooed AIDS drugs known as protease inhibitors are
not working as well as hoped, said Thomas J. Coates, director of
the AIDS Research Institute at the University of California at San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were oversold,'' said Coates, who charged that the
``scientific establishment is reprehensible'' for having allowed
the drugs to be over-promoted at the last international AIDS
conference held two years ago in Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, at the time, said it (the overselling) was public health
malpractice,'' Coates told a news conference Tuesday in advance of
the 12th World AIDS Conference, to be held June 28-July 3 in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Volberding, director of the AIDS program at San
Francisco General Hospital, was somewhat more upbeat. He expects
the mood at Geneva ``will still be positive (but) not as ecstatic
as at Vancouver.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates said in a telephone interview that protease inhibitors
``have helped a lot of people. They have extended life and given a
better quality of life to a significant proportion of the
population.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, ``they're just not the `cure' that some
people were talking about at Vancouver. ... They were oversold at
Vancouver. The talk about cure and eradication was incredibly
premature.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Stanford University Medical Center researchers
reported that for many AIDS patients treated with protease
inhibitors, their bodies have developed resistance to the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Shafer and his Stanford colleagues have genetically
analyzed AIDS viruses from about 200 patients in the San Francisco
area. One-fifth of the viruses were unaffected by the new drugs,
and at least half were partially resistant to the medications.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, AIDS patients who develop resistance to the new
drugs may, through sexual contact, be transmitting their resistance
to others, Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   Even in AIDS patients who do well under drug treatment, ``the
side effects are not trivial, and adherence (to the drug regime) is
not easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the Geneva conference, AIDS experts will discuss the
lack of easy access to AIDS counseling and treatment in developing
and impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
   HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus which transmits AIDS, is
``running rampant in the developing world,'' Coates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many life-saving (medical) technologies now, but even
the most simple of those are not available to people in the
developing world.'' He said those technologies include testing
blood supplies to ensure they are not contaminated by HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Coates called the United States' failure to adequately respond
to the international AIDS crisis one of ``the sins of the '90s. ...
If we were willing to spend 1 percent of the military budget, we
could probably stop the virus dead in its tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed 1999 budget for the Defense Department is nearly
$271 billion.

BREAST CANCER EXAM NO EASY STOP ON THE ROAD TO PREVENTION

   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Deborah Hunt held her breath while the
machine held her breast in a tight clamp for another X-ray. This
time it was a side view, and Hunt tilted her head to make room for
the medical camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``O.K. Debbie, right now I want you to hold your breath. Don't
move,'' said Debbie McClary, a senior mammography technologist at
Ellis Hospital. Seconds later, Hunt sighed and pulled her medical
robe around her shoulders. Around her middle, she wore a lead
apron. Her first mammogram was almost over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't bad,'' said Hunt, a mother of three. ``I expected it
to really hurt. It wasn't painful. It was awkward.''
</P>
<P>
   Most women have heard war stories about this first line of
defense against breast cancer. It's painful. It's embarrassing.
It's a rite of passage to middle age.
</P>
<P>
   For too many women, the mammogram is still the enemy, even
though regular screenings can detect breast cancer in its earliest
stages and improve the chances of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people would rather ignore it than deal with it,'' Hunt
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mammograms are recommended every two years for women over 40.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are clear: one in nine American women will develop
breast cancer in her lifetime. Some 43,500 are expected to die this
year.
</P>
<P>
   McClary believes fear keeps women away: ``Some women are fearful
of the exam and some women are fearful of the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in the examining room, Hunt waited while McClary looked
over the pictures of her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Hunt is right on schedule for her first mammogram. Most
doctors recommend that women get a baseline mammogram at 35. Those
pictures serve as a template to compare any future changes or
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't know they encouraged it before 40,'' said
Hunt, who lives in Glenville, N.Y. ``I thought I had a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, McClary returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beautiful,'' she said of the pictures. ``But I have to
take some more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt looked nervous. ``Why?'' she said. She knew of no breast
cancer in her family nor had she ever felt any lumps during her
self-examinations.
</P>
<P>
   After 22 years as a mammography technician, McClary understands
the anxiety. She lost an aunt to breast cancer and has made it her
career to help other aunts, mothers, sisters and daughters, fight
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Breasts are my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But every breast is different and some are harder to photograph
than others. In this case, she was hoping to get a better view of
Hunt's breast tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the photographer only,'' she said. ``I don't interpret or
diagnose. I try to give as much confidence as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Areta Pidwerbetsky, a radiologist, spends her time
interpreting the results of mammograms and calling patients for
additional exams when she sees a potential problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the callbacks end up being nothing,'' she said. ``It's
the minority that end up being serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunt changed back into her clothes. She had no idea that in a
week she'd be one of the women who get that call to schedule
another appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Pidwerbetsky tries to diffuse the fears: one in six women get
called back. Of those, 98 percent learn they don't have breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But a mammogram is the first step to peace of mind. ``If they
find it early, the prognosis is so much better, '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt is a registered nurse and familiar with medical odds.
</P>
<P>
   Most people, she knows from experience, don't expect to be the
one with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still think stuff like this can't happen to them,'' she
said.

vanished. Officials speculated that it had been stolen by
well-informed thieves who understood the significance of the
device. An alternative theory is that the hologram was snatched by
an unhappy esthete who understands the damage the Euro banknotes
will do to the continent's reputation as a place where the design
of everyday things has a high priority. By Karrie Jacobs.

   SUMMER-LIGHTS (Undated) _ It's true that everything looks better
by candlelight. Besides, it beats eating in the dark. But there are
hazards: there has been a recall of 30,000 fuel canisters called
Summer Lights by the Conros Corp. of Toronto in cooperation with
the Consumer Product Safety Commission. These plastic canisters for
outdoor bamboo torches can cause the bamboo poles to ignite. There
is a new, safer Tiki light: a 67-inch tall stainless steel model
with a fiberglass wick, which comes with a refillable canister. It
sells at $70 from the Williams Sonoma catalogue. By Marianne
Rohrlich.

   DESIGN-NOTEBOOK (Undated) _ Back in the 1930s, the running joke
among young architects in the office of Richard Neutra, the apostle
of modernism, was: ``What is the best material to build a steel
house of?'' To judge by a new steel-and-glass addition to a
just-restored Neutra house in Santa Monica, it's taken about 60
years for technology to catch up with his vision. By Joseph
Giovannini.

PUMPED-UP TIGER DETERMINED TO PROVE THE EXPERTS WRONG 
</HEADLINE>
   U.S. Open Notebook  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN FORNOFF  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Yes, Tiger Woods has heard that he's not the
prognosticators' pick to win the U.S. Open. So he gave them notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the challenge,'' Woods said. ``I like when people say
that. It definitely gets me a little revved up.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods is so revved up that he has stepped up his conditioning
routine in recent weeks to include more running and lifting. That,
he said, explained the back injury that knocked him out of the
Kemper Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back is fine, it's 100 percent now,'' he said. ``What
happened was that I was playing a lot of golf at the time, and I
was doing a lot of roadwork. What I mean by that, I was running.
All of a sudden I went from no miles to running four, five, six
miles every day, and that kind of puts a little stress on your
back, and I felt a little twinging, a little tightening and a
couple of spasms here and there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said know what, I'd rather have my body ready for the U.S.
Open. And so I decided to pull out of the Kemper and get everything
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready, he seems to be. Woods seemed entirely at ease after his
practice round Tuesday, even tickled at having to cough up a few
bucks to his friend and practice partner Casey Martin. He seemed
almost as if he couldn't wait for Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's different,'' Woods said. ``I feel great about my
swing. It has come along. I have shot some pretty good numbers
lately, and I am anxious to get out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And if proving the prognosticators wrong isn't motivation
enough, Woods can find more at home. He won his first tournament of
the year on Mother's Day and is shopping for a Father's Day present
for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lee Westwood has been tabbed as a future phenom of the PGA Tour;
he won his first tournament in New Orleans earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem is, the 25-year-old Westwood is a Briton. He's
having a hard time ditching the European Tour for the U.S. _ even
though it appears that he would like to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice, you know, to play in front of a lot of people,''
Westwood said. ``The courses are always in excellent condition with
fast greens, a lot faster than we play in Europe. And next year the
money is going to be a lot better, yeah. Not that money is ever a
motivator, but if there is a tournament in one place for $1 million
and there is another over here for $3 million, might as well play
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows his math.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, riding a streak of 154 consecutive majors, walked
through his practice round with a fairly pronounced limp at times.
The Golden Bear has a bum hip, but he's also nursing a pulled groin
muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 58, said he reaggravated the groin injury on Saturday,
but that a change in his stance has helped him avoid any pain over
the course of the last couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hip has been pretty good, the rest of me is pretty good,''
Nicklaus said. ``I just think what I did was when I was on my bear
hunt in early May, I was walking through the mountains with hiking
boots. I was going through some high grass, and I think I just
strained it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus said part of the problem with aging is that he can't
quite work his way through injuries like he used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 35, I could do anything I wanted,'' he said. ``I
can't do that anymore. ... My wife just looks at me and says, `Suck
it up and go play.' And she's right.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Eger of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., deserves special note
because he's a 48-year-old amateur who qualified for his first
Open, but he's also notable and notorious for having been the PGA
Tour official who decided to cancel the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National
Pro-Am in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Eger said he had no regrets, and no solutions to the weather
problems the tournament has had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision was made with the tournament sponsor in
conjunction with what they wanted to do, and now you see they're
coming back Aug. 17 and there's a lot of speculation that's wrong,
too,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately there wasn't a good result from that or this
year. There's just no good solution for what happened to them, in
'96 or '98.''
</P>
<P>
   Eger was more candid in speaking of his Open. ``The guys on the
PGA and European tour are so good ... you're just comparing apples
and oranges. You're comparing apples and rotten oranges, with the
qualifiers being the rotten oranges.''

   WASHINGTON _ In a maneuver dubbed ``Operation Dino Mite,'' a
military helicopter hovered over a deep ravine, lowered a sling and
pulled up fossils of a 6-foot-tall Thescelasaurus dinosaur for
transport to Montana State University's museum.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Oregon and towns throughout Missouri, troops have
built athletic fields for schools and communities. And in
``Operation Reefex,''(cq) they have dumped 85 old combat vehicles
and tanks off the New Jersey shore to serve as a reef.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the post-Cold War military and its ``innovative
readiness'' training program. Launched in 1992 under the leadership
of then-Senate Armed Forces Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., it
was born out of concern that the troops might have too much time on
their hands without a Soviet threat to confront.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the U.S. armed forces have been downsized
dramatically and stretched thin as they have been dispatched to
trouble spots around the globe. But the civil-military programs
have continued, despite questions about how carefully they have
been monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Although most projects have been short-range, low-budget items,
a major exception can be found on remote Annette Island in
southeastern Alaska. There, four branches of the armed services are
at work on a five-year project costing at least $20 million to
build 14 miles of gravel road, which the state has promised to pave
later for an estimated $15 million. The road will connect the tiny
Tsimshian Indian village of Metlakatla, population 1,600, to the
landing site for a planned ferry service that would be less than a
mile to the mainland, compared to the 15-mile trip now.
</P>
<P>
   This town on the only Indian reservation in the state had
unsuccessfully lobbied the federal and state governments for
decades to build the road, until they hooked up with the Department
of Defense. There they had a crucial ally in Sen. Ted Stevens, a
Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee and its
defense subcommittee, making him the most powerful senator when it
comes to deciding how the Pentagon will spend money. Moreover,
Stevens is famous for steering federal dollars in the direction of
his home state.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Stevens denied that the senator had proposed
``Operation Alaskan Road,'' as the project is called, but
acknowledged that his committee role put him in a position to make
sure it would be funded. ``It has been a department initiative, and
we've supported it,'' said John Raffetto, a spokesman for Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   The Alaska road project, costing more than $5 million last year,
consumed nearly one-third of the $16 million annual budget for
civil-military projects for all states. But Raffetto bristled at
the suggestion that the project was pork-barrel spending for a road
that will easily cost $22,000 per island resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you insinuating that $20 million (over five years) is too
expensive for that much training?'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the General Accounting Office, the investigating arm of
Congress, has raised questions about whether the Pentagon is
keeping tabs on its civilian projects, particularly the Alaska road
construction effort. ``The (Office of the Secretary of Defense) has
provided limited and inconsistent oversight,'' the accounting
office concluded in a report issued last March.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the ``training'' benefits were sometimes
questionable. Marines whose mission was to oversee fuel supplies
were detailed to do construction work, and combat engineers were
assigned work that bore little relation to combat-readiness,
including plumbing, masonry, and finished-work carpentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, it appeared the goal of completing the projects
took priority over the goal of providing valid valid military
training,'' said the accounting office. The study also said that
the Defense Department kept no accurate count of the number of
these projects, estimated at more than 130 nationwide last year,
and that officials had no actual cost total, since the various
services were absorbing expenses from their operations budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Alaska Road has required a major logistics effort,
including building a base camp of 37 buildings to house and feed
300 persons, including the National Guard and reservists from as
far away as Missouri and Massachusetts, who are shuttled in and out
on two-week shifts for their annual training exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Already the undertaking has brought in 850 Marines, who spent 23
days on ships sailing to and from the island from their base in San
Diego. Bringing in heavy equipment, including a rock crusher,
five-ton dump trucks and a bulldozer, required three deliveries by
the military's biggest plane, the C-5 Galaxy. The planes flew in
from a National Guard base in New York at a cost of $12,605 per
flight hour, not counting the expense for the seven-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Department officials described the road construction as
an example of doing for Americans what the U.S. military often does
in foreign countries where troops are stationed. ``This is a great
project,'' said Lt. Col. Kevin Kregcarek, spokesman for the Joint
Services Pacific Command, overseer for the Alaska road work.
</P>
<P>
   As for the questions the General Accounting Office raised about
training, Kregcarek said, ``I didn't see anything off the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more generalists in the military, he added. ``You learn
to adapt and you build on that expertise and you get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon public affairs department, in a faxed response to
questions about the program, said this week that the department has
tightened up procedures for the program and directed all services
to determine whether there is an ``increase in training costs'' in
civilian projects.
</P>
<P>
   The statement also defended the use of the program to deploy
military doctors and nurses to assist in low-income communities
instead of confining their work to the military. ``Training in real
world scenarios builds unit and individual morale, contributes to
recruiting and retention, and provides a 'double bang' for our
military training resource tax dollars,'' it said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Becky Juarez, a chatty teen-ager who recently graduated from
high school, the Internet is a juicy electronic grapevine virtually
crammed with information she wants, like gossip about her favorite
movie stars, no-nonsense descriptions of courses offered by the
college she plans to attend in the fall and tidbits about
bittersweet teen-age life, exchanged in scads of e-mail messages
and in online chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Like millions of others who went on line in the '90s, Ms.
Juarez, who is 18, says she cannot imagine life without her daily
dose of sitting at her family's computer and surfing the electronic
universe.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, she has discovered that her reach on the
World Wide Web has been extended because thousands of Web sites now
speak her language, Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Juarez, who lives in San Juan, is fluent in English and
French, but she is a native of Puerto Rico and has Spanish as her
first language. ``I think it's cool a lot of people in Latin
America, especially those who only speak Spanish, can feel good to
be in a site that is in our own language,'' Ms. Juarez, speaking of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Since its birth 19 years ago in the United States, the Net has
been dominated by the English language and North American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they have an opportunity to do what they want to do on the
Internet and be more comfortable about it.'' Ms. Juarez said in
flawless English in a recent telephone interview. ``I like it a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only the Spanish language, however, that is showing up
more often on the Internet. There have also been marked increases
in the use of Portuguese, German, Japanese, Chinese and
Scandinavian languages, among others, on the Internet, say
officials of some of the largest Internet companies based in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Non-English speakers are the fastest-growing group of new
Internet users; about 107 million people are already on line.
According to an Internet research group, Emarketer
(www.emarketer.com), the number of Internet users from outside the
United States will begin to outnumber those inside the country by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   The fastest-growing Internet markets are in China and India,
whose combined populations represent a third of the world's six
billion people. Vital Signs 1998, an annual statistical snapshot of
the world compiled by the World Watch Institute, a nonprofit public
policy group, projects that the number of Chinese and Indians on
line will multiply 15-fold, to 5.5 million users, by 2000. (While
many Indians speak English, many have said that they prefer to use
their native languages on line.)
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the number of people preferring to use languages
other than English on line could have profound implications for how
the Internet is used and developed, some analysts say. If the
Internet in the next century becomes more of a global mass medium,
the way commerce, news, research and entertainment are presented on
the Internet will have to be rethought.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the popularity of other languages on the Web has
prompted major search engines, like Yahoo and Excite, for example,
to offer their services in multiple languages. Just this month,
Netscape Communications announced a partnership with the leading
Latin America Internet service, Star Media Network, for a free
Internet guide in Spanish and Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts predict that the Internet might soon begin to
resemble international television, where audiences expect to view
their programs, even American imports like reruns of reruns of
``Seinfeld'' and ``Star Trek,'' in their own languages, many
analysts predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``English is the dominant language of the Internet, but it is
only a matter of time when the non-English speakers catch up to
that level,'' said L. Jasmine Kim, the international marketing
manager for Yahoo. ``I see the speed they are leapfrogging.''
</P>
<P>
   She explained that part of that leapfrogging _ skipping over the
Internet technology and practices of more developed Internet
nations _ was being fueled by the transformation of the Internet in
the rest of the world into more of a mass medium, rather than being
primarily a tool for members of a highly educated, high-income
elite, like the first wave of Internet adopters in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests that the average overseas Internet users will
increasingly be less like Becky Juarez, a multilingual,
upper-middle-class teen-ager, and will more likely be people with
moderate incomes who speak their native language primarily or
exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   A wider range of languages on the Internet, Ms. Kim said, may
mean that a wider range of ideas will be exchanged in cyberspace
and a greater diversity of goods and products will be offered for
sale over the Internet _ in other words, the long-promised global
village.
</P>
<P>
   But as the profile of the average Internet user changes, what
the new users tend to want and do on the Internet remains fairly
consistent with the preferences of Internet users in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Jack C. Chen, co-founder and president of Star Media, the Latin
America Internet service, which is free, said that while there are
regional variations across Latin America, e-mail and chat rooms are
very popular. The term ``cyber sexo'' is a popular topic in Latin
American chat topics, just as cybersex draws a crowd as a topic in
American chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Local news and weather are also very popular in countries on the
Internet, said Mark VanHern, a co-founder of Excite and the product
manager in charge of Chinese Excite, and people certainly prefer
those types of information in their own language.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the number of English speakers is second only to the
number of people speaking Chinese, he said, in China, for instance,
``Joe Schmoe does not speak English, and he doesn't want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him, the World Wide Web will mostly be in Chinese with
some English,'' VanHern said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One result of the shift in language could be a crack in American
hegemony over Internet culture. Currently, more than half of the
Internet's users _ 62 million people _ live in the United States,
but the rate of online growth has slowed there.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet users complain that while the Internet is awash in
information, almost all of it flows in one direction: from the
United States to the rest of the increasingly wired world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent of what I see on the Internet is in
English only,'' said Oscar Ruben Batista Gaxiola, who lives in
Mexicali, Mexico, near the California border. While he can read and
speak English, he said, ``I would rather go to Spanish sites.
Basically, it is more comfortable for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Mello, 50, a Brazilian businessman who works in Rio de
Janeiro, said he felt much the same way. He mostly uses the
Internet, through Star Media, for sports and news in Portuguese. As
the National Basketball Association finals wound down in Salt Lake
City last week and World Cup soccer competition heated up in Paris,
Web sites featuring soccer players were vastly more popular among
non-English speakers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that as the Internet emerges as a new industry
and as a new medium, people would realize early in the game that
the entire world does not speak our language,'' said Steve Horen, a
senior research analyst on Internet issues for Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people, like Michel Eckersley, the owner of Digital
Design, a computer design house based in New York, say they believe
that English will long continue to be the standard language of
cyberspace, much as English is the international language of
aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley, a British man who was born in Malaysia and speaks
several languages, said English had practically become the default
language of business. In a world of many languages and dialects,
where many different tongues are often used even in a single
country, English is the common language of commerce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the language will deepen its hold on the world
as more people go on line, reinforcing the highly influential
cultural might of American film, television, music and life styles,
Eckersley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``English language is the dominant language of the world,'' he
said. ``I think it will be the dominant language of the Internet,
of computers, as more and more people learn English.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Renwick, the Internet site project manager in the
marketing department of Great Brands of Europe, which includes Web
sites for French brands like Evian and Dannon, said even the
French, famously fastidious about guarding their language against
dilution by foreign words and phrases, had been forced to surrender
to American vernacular on Internet matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you know that the French have no word for Internet?''
Renwick asked. ``They don't.'' And it is not unusual for
French-language Web sites to direct users to more detailed
English-language sites on the same subjects or products, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Fernando J. Espuelas and Jack Chen, the partners who founded
the Star Media Network, say the dominance of English on the
Internet is being challenged, at least in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Espuelas and Chen, childhood friends in the United States, began
the production version of Star Media, the first service of its
kind, in early 1997, and the response was swift.
</P>
<P>
   Star Media's site already attracts one million visits each
month, said Espuelas, a personable 31-year-old former AT&AMP;T
executive. Star Media (www.starmedia.com) gets about 50 million
page views a day, said Espuelas, the company's chief executive and
chairman of its board. He expects that number to reach 60 million
by the end of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like any mainstream Internet service, Star Media provides a
flashy offering of world and regional news, weather, stock
listings, e-mail, chat rooms, Internet access and more, all in
Spanish and Portuguese and tailored to the 18 Latin American
countries the company serves. One of the more popular features is a
soccer trivia game timed to the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are only in Spanish and Portuguese, and we believe that is
where the market will be,'' said Espuelas, who moved from his
native Uruguay to Connecticut when he was 9 years old. ``There is
an expectation that everyone will eventually become American. I
don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Espuelas, who is fluent in Spanish and English and lives in the
United States, said he recognized English's popularity. And he
concedes that the growth in the number of people learning English
as a secondary language was unlikely to slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that doesn't take away the reality that your mother tongue
is your mother tongue,'' Espuelas said. ``Especially on the
Internet.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No matter what personal computer you choose, no matter how
carefully you shop, one thing is almost certain: in 90 days or
less, a better, faster and cheaper computer will be available. The
frantic pace of change in the computer industry guarantees that
today's cutting-edge technology will be dull within two years.
</P>
<P>
   So what does one do? Buy now and enjoy the brief season when
your computer is at its prime? Or buy later, when you know you'll
get a BFC (better faster cheaper) system? If historic trends
continue, you'll probably save money by waiting, but at what cost
in lost productivity and deferred enjoyment?
</P>
<P>
   The decision becomes a little easier if you know what technical
advances are coming in months ahead. Then you can assess whether
the advances are compelling enough to warrant waiting, or are
candidates for upgrading down the road. Computer makers already
know what they will be selling later this year and have a pretty
good idea of what will be coming in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can, too. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MICROPROCESSORS _ Today's dream machine is based on an Intel
Pentium II chip revved to 400 megahertz. By the time Santa starts
getting letters this year, they will include requests for Intel's
even faster chip, the 450-megahertz Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   Next year will bring a 500-megahertz Pentium II chip from Intel
called Katmai, which will take the so-called MMX multimedia
extensions to a new level. People interested in having the best
machine for playing Incoming, the season's hottest new game, will
want to wait until the Katmai chips arrive after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's goal is to drive the industry to adopt ever faster and
more powerful chips, replacing Pentium chips with Pentium IIs. But
consumers are also demanding less expensive personal computers that
sell for under $1,000. Intel's rivals, including Advanced Micro
Devices (amD), Cyrix and Integrated Device Technology, have all
produced rival chips that provide more bang for the buck than
Intel's at the low end. IBM and Compaq chose amD's chips instead of
Intel's for their consumer computers, for example.
</P>
<P>
   To meet the challenge on the low end, Intel introduced a
stripped-down version of its Pentium II chip. The new chip, called
the Celeron, was scorned by many major PC companies. But Intel
recently announced a pair of improved Celeron chips, the
300-megahertz A chip and the Celeron 333, both of which should be
in systems by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's Power PC 750 G3 chip outperforms Intel chips at the same
clock speed. Apple demonstrated a 400-megahertz version recently.
But with Apple's market share hovering at 4 percent, no one is
going to choose a Macintosh based on the processor alone. The
next-generation G4 chips will be offered next year by Motorola. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3-D GRAPHICS _ This year, for the first time, high-end PCs will
do a better job with games than even the impressive Sony
Playstation. A $3,000, game-optimized PC, without a monitor, still
costs about 20 times as much as the Playstation, of course, but at
least the neighbors' kids won't sneer.
</P>
<P>
   Realistic 3-D graphics are made possible by faster central
processors, a new crop of plug-in cards that accelerate the display
of graphics with a special processor and lots of video memory, and
a new internal data system called the Accelerated Graphics Port,
sort of an express lane for graphics.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the AGP is limited to Pentium II systems, but rival
chips are expected to match it later. By then, though, the standard
will be Intel's AGP 2X, already in some machines, which broadens
the graphics pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   While games and educational software are the primary
beneficiaries of these advances, there will be benefits for
Internet and business applications as well. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEMORY _ A year ago, the mainstream computer had 16 megabytes of
random access memory. Since then, the semiconductor industry has
fallen on hard times. Prices for memory have plunged, and 32 MB to
48 MB of RAM is the current standard for entry-level machines.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a sudden shift in semiconductor capacity or demand, 64
MB of RAM is already common on midlevel machines, and it could
become the new standard this year. It is not unusual to see
consumers loading up with 128 MB or more. Adding more memory is one
of the most cost-effective ways to improve system performance.
</P>
<P>
   Memory chips feed the central processing unit with data and
instructions to be processed. The problem is that microprocessor
speeds have soared to 400 megahertz in recent years but the rest of
the memory subsystem has not kept pace, so the main processor is
almost always waiting for data to crunch. To ease the bottleneck,
most computers use a high-speed memory cache, but that is just a
stopgap measure.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Intel introduced a new chip set, called
440BX, that increases the speed limit between memory and processor
to 100 megahertz, from 66 megahertz. It makes a big difference.
Look for Synchronous D-RAM, or SD-RAM, which signifies the new bus.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime next year an even faster system called Direct Rambus
D-RAM promises to eliminate the bottleneck completely, allowing
memory to work effectively at processor speeds. This will be a
major breakthrough. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONITORS _ The improvement in graphics, along with the rise of
the Internet, has fueled demand for larger monitors. A 17-inch
monitor is rapidly becoming the standard size, although 15-inch
models will continue to be popular on entry-level configurations.
The trade-off, of course, is that traditionally, bigger monitors
have hogged desk space; they are about as deep in inches as the
screen size. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two trends are emerging to offset that problem. New
``short-neck'' picture tubes allow larger screens that don't take
up more space. For example, a 19-inch short-neck monitor has a
bigger viewable area, but the same depth, as a conventional 17-inch
monitor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For real space savings, well-heeled consumers are turning to
liquid crystal display (LCD) screens, which have several advantages
over cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays. They are just a few inches
deep (some are flat enough to hang on a wall), they don't flicker
and thus are generally less stressful on the eyes, they weigh much
less, and they emit no radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The big disadvantage is cost: flat-panel displays cost at least
twice as much, and often several times more, than comparably sized
CRT monitors. Analysts say flat-panel LCDs won't begin to displace
tube monitors until the price difference is no more than 1.5 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   That's going to be tough, because prices for CRT monitors are
dropping fast, and quality is increasing. An Austin, Texas,
company, iDOT, was selling 17-inch monitors for $199 recently if
they were purchased with a computer system. And 19-inch monitors
are now widely available for less than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend is the emergence of monitors that plug into the
Universal Serial Bus (USB) port on newer computers, making set-up
and configuration easier.
</P>
<P>
   Farther ahead: superior gas plasma displays, 20 inches and
larger, will begin to show up at consumer-affordable prices in a
couple of years. Some are available now for $3,500 and up. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   PORTS _ Most new PCs sold this year will come with at least one
Universal Serial Bus port, and by next year USB ports will be
ubiquitous. This is a good feature because _ in theory at least _
it eliminates the need to fiddle with interrupt settings and other
esoterica when adding new peripheral devices like keyboards or
scanners or printers. The peripheral has to be USB-compatible, too.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be the current PCI ports on new computers, so
peripherals based on that standard will not be going obsolete. The
same cannot be said for the ancient ISA bus standard that has
somehow survived since the first IBM PC. This may be the last year
that PC makers include an ISA slot.
</P>
<P>
   Another bus system, officially called IEEE 1394 but popularly
known as Firewire, will begin showing up on high-end systems this
year. Firewire will eventually become the high-speed standard for
connecting digital video cameras, VCRs, digital VCRs, cable modems,
network cards and other peripherals that demand the highest
bit-transfer rates. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HARD DISKS _ It seems like only yesterday when hard disk
capacity was measured in megabytes. Today gigabytes are the norm on
new consumer PCs, typically 2 GB to 4 GB on entry-level machines.
Because of other hardware limitations, most hard disks this year
won't exceed about 8 GB, although some PC systems will use
different tricks to hit 10 GB to 20 GB or more. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   REMOVABLE STORAGE _ The familiar 3.5-inch, 1.44-MB diskette is
past its prime. It will live on for years, just as 5.25-inch
floppies lingered after the 3.5-inch drives first appeared, but new
technologies will begin to replace it this year. People need more
than 1.44 MB to store multimedia files, like those created with
digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Iomega's popular 100-megabyte Zip drive is one contender to
replace the diskette, but it cannot work with existing diskettes,
so it is not the ideal choice. Compaq and some others support a
diskette-compatible format called LS-120, which crams 120 MB onto
newer 3.5-inch disks. But Sony's HiFD, a 200-megabyte diskette
drive scheduled to appear late this year, appears to be a strong
contender. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the floppy disk, CD-ROM drives are also spinning down, to
be replaced by some form of DVD. The top speed for CD-ROM today is
32X, but it is unlikely to go much higher. CD-ROMs can store
``only'' 650 megabytes of data, while DVD-ROM can hold 4.7 GB. (DVD
capacity is very likely to double next year.) Again, digital
imaging is the grim reaper for CD-ROM. DVD is the future.
</P>
<P>
   Second-generation (2X) DVD-ROM drives can be added to newer
computers for less than $300. Avoid first-generation (1X) models.
If feasible, wait for third-generation, read-and-write DVD drives
in the fall, which include DVD(plus)RW, DVD-R/W, and DVD-RAM. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOUND SYSTEMS _ Graphics aren't the only thing going 3-D. Most
sound cards today offer 3-D audio, creating the impression that
sounds are coming from all around the user. The new trend is
``positional 3-D audio,'' which links the sound effects to the
position of a moving object in a game. (As the race car passes you,
the sound will go from back to front, for example.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, you'll want new speakers to show off the sound.
Microsoft's new Digital Sound System 80 (80 watts) coming out in
the fall ($260) uses the USB port to bypass the audio card.
</P>
<P>
   Because the sound processing is done inside the speakers
themselves instead of in the electronically noisy environment
inside the computer, the new speakers eliminate noise and hiss and
thus offer more realistic 3-D sound quality. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KEYBOARDS _ Even though most people still have 10 fingers and
the typewriter keyboard layout has not changed much in a century,
big changes are ahead for PC keyboards. Most notable is the
addition of an Internet button, now offered by companies like
Compaq on its Presario line.
</P>
<P>
   Hit the button, and the computer automatically opens an Internet
connection (assuming the user has an Internet account) for quick
access to e-mail, news and the Web _ even computer technical
support.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keyboard makers will be adding a variety of special-button
solutions in the year ahead, not just for the Internet but also for
other common tasks like bringing up a calendar or address book or
controlling a CD audio player. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomic keyboards are becoming more common, too, to relieve
wrist and hand stress. Microsoft _ remember when it was a software
company? _ has a new Natural Keyboard Elite ($46) ergonomic
keyboard that takes up less space than its predecessor. Datadesk
has a $99 model with smaller keys to the center, larger keys on the
outside. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOYSTICKS _ Last year the hot product was a ``force feedback''
joystick for playing games, adding the sensation of feel to games
that used to rely on audio and visual cues. Later this year,
Microsoft _ again _ will add force feedback to a new $210 steering
wheel that can be used instead of a joystick for driving games.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a $75 game control pad that allows users to
steer by tipping the controller left and right, like driving a
motorcycle. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mice are being redesigned to be more comfortable in the hand,
and new ones come with ``wheels'' on top that allow Web surfers to
scroll sideways and up and down through pages without moving the
mouse itself. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COST _ No matter how much personal computer prices fall, the
most desirable one always seems to cost $4,000. This was true when
the Apple II and IBM PC first arrived, and it is true today. But
for those who do not need the fastest or flashiest machine on the
block, or who are on a tight budget, computing is getting cheaper
all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, low-end computers reached $999. By Christmas this
year, $599 may be the mark _ or even lower. (Monitor extra, as they
say, and it probably won't have the 48 MB RAM needed to run Windows
98 effectively.) Today, $1,200 will buy a decent Pentium-class
computer, keyboard and monitor system. The $1,000 barrier could
fall later this year.

NO MAJOR FLOODING SEEN DESPITE FULL RESERVOIRS, RIVERS IN N.
CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As El Nino relinquishes its cool, clammy grip on
California, it leaves brimming reservoirs and rambunctious rivers
and hints that it is not yet through causing trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Nevada retains 70 percent of an unusually heavy
snowpack, and several days of warm weather have finally produced
the snowmelt that normally comes weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   More water is flowing into the reservoirs than is flowing out:
Some are 96 percent or more full. But no major flooding is
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough space saved to contain possible floods,'' said
Maurice Roos, the state's chief hydrologist.
</P>
<P>
   Some flooding on the state's wild rivers seems inevitable. This
week, the abrupt rise of the Merced River forced the evacuation of
30 Yosemite Valley campers and closed the Yosemite National Park's
main entrance road. The 100-foot washout on Highway 120 has left
the southern entrance, Highway 41, as the only way into the park.
</P>
<P>
   While it appears that 1998 will be a grand year for whitewater
rafters _ high water is expected to last well into October _ some
rivers are simply too dangerous to run now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an amazing year,'' said Chet Bowling, chief of the
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation's water operations division. May storms
turned normal seasons topsy-turvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty cold, and the snowmelt stopped, and in some
places (the snowpack) actually grew,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of California's reservoirs are expected to be full in the
next week or two. Don Pedro on the Tuolumne River, is 89 percent
full. Lake Shasta on the Sacramento River, keystone of the Central
Valley Project, is at 99 percent capacity _ so full that on
Thursday the bureau will open the drum gates near the top of the
dam to flush out debris that has collected on the surface of the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're expecting the inflows to drop off pretty soon,''
said Gary Hester, who heads the State Department of Water
Resources' hydrology branch.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Nevada snowpack measured at Echo Summit on May 1 was
67.4 inches, with 34 inches of water content. There have been only
seven deeper, wetter measurements in the past 50 years. During the
last El Nino in 1983, the depth was 144.5 inches, with a water
content of 64.7 inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the snowmelt now that we usually get in May,''
said Yosemite ranger Al Nash. ``Just another reminder that nature's
in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   El Nino is the name given to the unusual warming of waters in
the Pacific Ocean that affects global wind and temperature
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   A prolonged period of intense heat that would melt the entire
snowpack in a hurry could overwhelm the capacity of the rivers and
cause some flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The most flood-prone area is the San Joaquin Valley south of
Modesto where the Tuolumne, Stanislaus and San Joaquin rivers
converge.
</P>
<P>
   But ``we're not seeing a forecast of really intensely hot
weather,'' Roos said. ``The only (flood prone) areas we'd worry
about are the ones in the high basins of the Sierra from the Merced
to the Kern (rivers).''
</P>
<P>
   State climatologist Bill Mork concurred. El Nino has raised the
ocean temperature, so the weather should be somewhat warmer than in
a non-El Nino year, ``but not as warm as '83,'' he said. ``El Nino
is really dying.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a flood watch was in effect Wednesday for rivers
and streams in the southern Sierra Nevada. The rapid snowmelt
caused by the warm weather already has caused the Merced to flood
and the Kings River near Cedar Grove to approach flood stage.
</P>
<P>
   The National Weather Service said the flood threat would run
high in the next few days on the San Joaquin, Kaweah, Tule and Kern
rivers.

NEW YORK COURT HOLDS TOYOTA LIABLE IN AIR BAG CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's highest court has ruled that the
Toyota Motor Corp. can be held liable for injuries that might have
been prevented by an air bag, even though air bags were not
required at the time of a 1991 accident.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision means a Brooklyn woman who was severely hurt
in a low-speed crash can pursue a $10 million lawsuit against the
automobile company. It also means auto manufacturers who adhere to
all government manufacturing standards can still be sued in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decisions like this make manufacturers sit up and listen in
terms of what safety improvements they put in their vehicle,'' said
Manhattan attorney Alan Shapey, who represents the plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Tetherow, spokesman for Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc. in
California, said the ruling was ``contrary to numerous appellate
decisions, both state and federal, throughout the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Court of Appeals rejected Toyota's claim that the
National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which gave
auto manufacturers the option of installing air bags to meet
restraint requirements, pre-empts state law. Since Toyota could
have installed air bags in its 1991 Tercel vehicles, and chose not
to, the company may be liable for the victim's injuries, regardless
of the federal statute, the court reasoned in a 6-1 opinion.
</P>
<P>
   At the crux of the case is the presumed primacy of federal law
and the independent right of the states to establish standards for
legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Caryn Drattel, a certified public accountant
with Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York, was driving her 1991 Tercel
at approximately 25 mph when the vehicle was struck head-on by a
1988 Honda Accord. Drattel, who was wearing a seat belt, suffered a
permanent brain injury and her family sued Toyota, claiming the
Tercel was defectively designed.
</P>
<P>
   Under New York law, plaintiffs in such product liability cases
have to prove not only that a vehicle was defectively designed, but
an alternative design was available that would have made the car
safer. Drattel's lawyer argued that air bags were available at the
time the Tercel was manufactured, and an air bag would have
prevented the then 29-year-old woman's injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota noted that the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety
Act of 1966 gave manufacturers the option of equipping vehicles
with any one of three safety systems _ air bags, passive belt
restraints or manual belt restraints. A trial court justice
dismissed the lawsuit. But an appellate court reinstated the action
in a decision upheld Tuesday by the state's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority, Judge Joseph A. Bellacosa said the
fact that Toyota could have, if it so chose, installed
driver's-side air bags in its 1991 Tercels raises a question of
whether it would have been reasonable and prudent to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This injured plaintiff should not be deprived of the
opportunity to establish ... that Toyota should have included a
driver's-side air bag because, for instance, it possessed the
technology and because it was aware that the inclusion of an air
bag would have been a better alternative safety device given the
specific design of the car,'' Bellacosa wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In dissent, Judge Howard A. Levine said the state Legislature
could not have imposed a regulation requiring air bags _ such a law
would have impermissibly intruded in federal domain _ and said the
court should not, effectively, do what the Legislature cannot.
</P>
<P>
   He said Tuesday's decision would ``inevitably undermine the
regulatory, interest-weighing cost/benefit determination by
Congress ... and by federal regulators.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the decision has national implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it is important for Caryn Drattel and her family,''
said the plaintiff's appellate counsel, Arthur H. Bryant of
Washington. ``It is also important for others across the country
because of the prominence of the New York court.''

PC EXPO FOCUSES ON CONSUMER DEMAND FOR MINIATURIZATION 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In this age of consumer convenience and ease of use,
the name of the game is miniaturization. Both the appeal and some
of the limits of miniaturization were abundantly evident this week
in the cavernous Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York,
where PC Expo, the largest computer trade show on the East Coast,
opened on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing more than 600 high-tech companies, including IBM,
Microsoft, Compaq and Gateway, the exposition's floor was crammed
with booths brimming with the wonders of the very small and
reportedly very useful from the latest in flat display screens to
palm-sized DVD movie players and personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The current trend toward miniaturization is more a result of
consumer demand than technological advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like big steaks and small electronics,'' said Fred
Swan, a director of marketing at Logitech in Fremount, Calif. He
said that space in American homes was becoming more limited, and
that if consumers could buy smaller scanners to make more room on
their desks for another framed picture of their children, they
would.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he noted, in home and office space in Japan is so tight
that desktop computers have mostly given way to much smaller
laptops.
</P>
<P>
   Logitech is developing an ergonomically-correct keyboard
codenamed the Huxley that will have full-sized keys but will be at
least two inches smaller overall than most conventional keyboards.
But Swan and other representatives of high-technologies companies
said that the rush to reduce the size of sophisticated, electronic
devices has its own limits, and most of them have less to do with
technology than with the anatomy of consumer's bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keyboards can only be so small,'' said Swan. ``There are a lot
of tiny keyboards on laptops and everything else that are just too
small and too close and are in an arrangement that is unfamiliar
that causes the usability to suffer quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the trend, Logitech has been making computer-pointing
devices, like mice, joy sticks and track balls, larger and larger
to fit more people's hands more comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   At the Smart Technologies booth at PC Expo, the Canadian-based
company that builds large electronic projection boards, a new
smaller board was featured.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer was looking for it,'' said Tabitha Beaton, a
company spokeswoman in the company's home office in Calgary.
``eople said they were working in smaller groups.''
</P>
<P>
   So Smart Technologies created a 38-inch Smart Board that is 20
inches smaller than its standard board. Any smaller, she said with
a chuckle, and the board would not be much better than a
commonplace 17-inch computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Many phone service booths at the Expo offered some of the
smallest cellular phones on the market. Two the telephones _ the
Motorola Star Tac and the Ericsson CF 788 _ weigh only a few ounces
and are swallowed up in an average-sized palm.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to mobile communications and cell phones, the
size and weight of these devices for professionals becomes
important,'' said Michael J. Wieser, a commercial banker who
co-founded Cel-Pro Associates, a New York-based cellular phone
business. ``They need something that they can throw into their suit
pockets or into their purse.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding one the tiny telephones to his face, Wieser wondered
aloud how smaller the telephones can get. ``If they get any smaller
the mouth piece is not going to reach your mouth,'' he said. ``The
next thing is going to be the Dick Tracy wristwatch phone.''
Cellular telephone manufacturers said Wieser could not be more
correct.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, a veteran at the miniturization game but a relative
newcomer to the computer industry, unveiled its Vaio 505 series
computer notebooks. Measuring an inch thick when closed and
weighing three pounds, the 505 Superslim is being billed by Sony as
the smallest, fully functional notebook. Its introduction at the PC
Expo was greeted with a chorus of ohhs and ahhs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's first reaction is not to look at all of this great
technology,'' Matthew J. Smith, the senior marketing manager for PC
products marketing for Sony said of first impressions of the
Superslim notebooks which go on sale next month. ``It's just,
`Wow,' a purely emotional response.''

THANKS, DAD

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Like father, like son.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of actor/director James Keach, it's an ongoing
challenge to follow in his father's footsteps. Like his dad, Stacy
Keach Sr., the youngest member of the theatrical Keach clan has
been an actor, director and producer, and now he's pursuing another
aspect of the senior Keach's career: teaching.
</P>
<P>
   While his father was a speech and theater arts professor at
Northwestern, (before directing at the Pasadena Playhouse, signing
with Universal and starting his own production company), James will
make his teaching debut this fall at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attended Northwestern and Yale, but since my son, Kalen, is
a USC student, it's an obvious choice,'' he explained during a chat
at the June 9 Father's Day Council Awards at the Beverly Hilton.
Keach, 50; his parents, Mary and Stacy Keach Sr. of Sherman Oaks;
his wife, Jane Seymour (star of ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman''); and
their six children were all at the event, at which James was
honored as a Father of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   With that much family, posing for pictures and conducting
interviews was pandemonium. Two-year-old twins Kristopher and John
were crying, and each of the other four children _ Kalen, 21;
Jenni, 18; Katie, 16; and Sean, 12 _ took turns at entertaining
them.
</P>
<P>
   Once settled down, with pictures out of the way, James continued
talking about his wonderful family. ``Kalen, is not only on the
dean's list but has already written a screenplay. And guess who
he's asked to direct it?''
</P>
<P>
   Of daughter Katie, he said, ``She wrote me a letter, saying I'm
always there for her. And my stepdaughter Jenni handed me a letter
of congratulations. She wrote `Thank you ... It's a comfort to be
around someone so full of love.' And Sean won a sports award at
school and gave me his trophy for my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about Father's Day honors.
</P>
<P>
   According to Katie, ``We usually go out to lunch or brunch on
Father's Day and he orders roast chicken.'' But son Kalen says he
wants to take his dad fly fishing as his Father's Day gift.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing is a Keach family tradition, according to Stacy Sr.
``There were plenty of Father's Day barbecues when James and his
brother, Stacy (star of `Mike Hammer'), were growing up, but we
often went fishing, even if it was only to the fish pond at the
Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. I remember the first time I took
James there and he caught a fish. At first he was excited, but then
he cried (because the fish died). But he got over it and turned out
to be a skilled fisherman.''
</P>
<P>
   James recalls those days, too. ``Dad and I would do fun things,
not always on the actual Father's Day. Sometimes he'd let me play
hooky from school and take me fishing or on the set of a film he
was working on. And now I try to do those things with my
children,'' he comments.
</P>
<P>
   For James, Father's Day isn't so much about gifts for Dad as
much as recalling those from Dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important gift my father ever gave me was to focus on
the brighter side of life and never be indifferent or turn your
back on people in need. I try to do that with my kids and teach
them the same values. After all, the bottom line in life is about
what you do for your family, both biological and extended. And
that's what God will be asking ... not about my movie grosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad also taught me to be passionate and to follow your dreams.
When I was little he'd tuck me in at night and say, `Hitch your
wagon to a star.'''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Keach did follow his dreams, and his dad, now 84, is
proud. According to Stacy Sr., ``Dads want love more than anything,
although they treasure all the handmade gifts and cards their
children make when they're small. Love and respect, that's the best
... but the Italian shirt my son gave me this year _ we celebrated
a week early _ is great, too,'' he said with a chuckle.

   COMSAT-LAWSUIT: FORT WORTH _ A Texas man who worked on
telecommunications deals in Africa has won a $4.25 million judgment
against his former employer, which he said fired him to avoid
paying his commission on a $38.2 million Ivory Coast deal. By LAURA
VOZZELLA. Story will move in ``a'' general news category. &QL;

   STAPLES-COLUMN: UNDATED _ You wouldn't know it by looking at me,
thank goodness, but my thighs are pretty good friends, touching
just so I can't ever forget that they're there, loving each other.
This generally doesn't bother me until my annual visit to Dr.
Langham's office, when that cute little skinny nurse announces,
``Um, looks like 'bout 145.'' I step off the scale and want to
strangle her. I grumble about the scale being all wrong and why
can't they get the thing fixed. It's no wonder I don't own one. By
GRACIE BONDS STAPLES. Story will move in ``l'' lifestyle category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANDERSON-COLUMN: UNDATED _ Back in April, I promised to tell you
guys about my class reunion. It's been 10 years since I waltzed
across the stage and received that awesome sheet of paper that told
the world I was finally an official Doctor of Dental Surgery. Boy,
was I a happy camper that day! By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON. Story

<P>
   SWEET SALSA &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Fruit is the hottest thing on today's salsa market.
Peaches, plums, watermelon, cantaloupe, papaya, pineapple, mango
and nectarines are cozying up to chiles to create a mixed marriage
made in heaven. It ain't your grandpa's salsa, that chunky,
jalapeno blend that's red from the tomatoes and hot from the
chiles. Now, the haute thing is hot things in many tropical hues.
By BEVERLY BUNDY. Story will move in ``d'' food and dining
category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COOKBOOK-UPDATE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ It was a good idea then and an even better idea now.
When ``The Elegant but Easy Cookbook'' by Marian Burros and Lois
Levine was published in 1960, it set the standard for the
time-strapped hostess. But 38 years and 500,000 copies later, the
authors decided the book needed a face lift _ and a diet. By

   YOU-DON'T-KNOW-BEANS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ I have a friend who courteously disagrees with all
this business of fancy cooking and intricate recipes. ``Why fuss
over cooking so much?'' he asks. ``If you know how to make red
beans and corn bread, that's all you need to know. I could eat them
every day.'' He has a point. By ART CHAPMAN. Story will move in

don't think about her a whole lot, don't much care which ballplayer
she's dating. But when she gave only two days' notice that she
would NOT sing at the recent KISS Party '98 at Starplex, well, that
bothered me. By DAVE FERMAN. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment

</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ If President Clinton's speech defending his planned
trip to China was what it appeared to be, it was a speech of great
historical significance. OK, you're thinking, what was so
significant about it? Well, if the speech was what it seemed _ we
are talking about Clinton, so the operative word is ``if'' _ then
it marked a rare political occurrence: Bill Clinton took a stand on
principle. By BILL THOMPSON. Story will move in ``k'' commentary
category. &QR; -qHRJb(BE-COLUMN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Nita Robbins lost her only son in a war that divided
this country. Now all she wants from her government is a new Gold
Star pin, one in which the deep-blue enamel background isn't
chipped and worn. By J.R. LABBE. Story will move in ``k''
commentary category. &QL;

BUGS BUNNY DANGLES A CLASSIC CARROT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bugs as Bogey? Daffy as Sam? Tweety as Peter
Lorre?
</P>
<P>
   Nyaaaahh, what's up, Doc?
</P>
<P>
   It's ``Carrotblanca,'' an enjoyable Looney Tunes
reinterpretation of the war-time classic ``Casablanca,'' that will
debut on television Saturday and Sunday as part of the Cartoon
Network's annual Bugs Bunny marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The 8.5-minute ``Carrotblanca'' was created in 1995 and paired
with box-office bust ``The Great Panda Adventure'' in theaters. It
since has been available on home video but never shown on TV, said
Cartoon Network spokesman Paul Siefken.
</P>
<P>
   Like its great 1950s predecessors, the cartoon features several
delightful little in-jokes for the observant, such as a sign
advertising a show by ``Eleanor Roosevelt's All-Girl Revue'' and
Bugs' carrot-juice bender.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, in the fateful airport scene, the intercom
announces the plane's destinations, including ``Cucamonga,'' or
more accurately ``Cuuuuuu-Caaaa-Monn

USE OF NEW INGREDIENTS GIVES CLASSIC 1960 COOKBOOK A TIMELY UPDATE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a good idea then and an even better idea now.
</P>
<P>
   When ``The Elegant but Easy Cookbook'' by Marian Burros and Lois
Levine was published in 1960, it set the standard for the
time-strapped hostess. But 38 years and 500,000 copies later, the
authors decided that the book needed a face lift _ and a diet.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the loads of cream, butter and good old American
cheese and the grated stuff in a green can, ``The New Elegant but
Easy Cookbook'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster) takes advantage of the plethora
of products now in the supermarkets, from bok choy to fresh oregano
to light sour cream.
</P>
<P>
   Some dishes, although they satisfied our fascination with
foreign food, were often so far from their source that they could
be unrecognizable. The boeuf bourguignon in the original book
includes tapioca, sugar, canned mushrooms, canned potatoes and (!)
water chestnuts. The new version uses low-sodium beef stock, fresh
white cremini or portobello mushrooms, low-sodium canned Italian
tomatoes and burgundy wine.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are gone: Jell-O salads, for instance. Although much
loved in the South, they were deemed passe by the authors. Oh,
well. We'll console ourselves with the greens with pears and
gorgonzola vinaigrette, the chicken and potatoes with bleu cheese
dressing, and the Armenian vegetable salad.
</P>
<P>
   ARMENIAN VEGETABLE SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12
</P>
<P>
   1 pound white mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds green beans, trimmed
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   7 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   4 large red bell peppers, roasted and julienned, see Note
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches green onions, white and most of the green part, finely
sliced
</P>
<P>
   20 large or 30 small Italian, Greek or French olives, pitted
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Note: To roast peppers, preheat broiler. Wash peppers, place on
a cookie sheet and broil about 2-3 inches from the source of heat,
turning with tongs until skins blister and char all over, 15-20
minutes. As each pepper is ready, place in a large plastic bag and
keep bag closed for about 10 minutes; steaming will facilitate
removal of the skin. Remove peppers from bag; the skins should peel
off easily. After peeling, cut peppers in half, remove seeds and
julienne. Refrigerate if not making salad immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Wash and trim mushrooms. Depending on their size, leave whole,
halved or quartered. Steam over hot water for about 5 minutes,
until tender. Set aside. Steam green beans about 7 minutes,
depending on size. Drain and halve or cut into thirds, depending on
size. Cover and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk oil, vinegar and mustard together and pour over mushrooms,
peppers, green onions and olives; cover and refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, stir green beans into rest of the salad. Season with
salt and pepper. Don't stir green beans into the dressing more than
30 minutes in advance of serving, because the acid will turn them
gray-green.

   GREEN AND GOLD SQUASH
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4-6
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound zucchini, coarsely grated
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound yellow summer squash, coarsely grated
</P>
<P>
   1 medium (8 ounces) onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano OR 1 teaspoon dried oregano
</P>

</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup low-fat or nonfat buttermilk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup whole wheat bread crumbs, optional
</P>
<P>
   Note: This dish can be made a day in advance and refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   Place grated squash in kitchen towel and twist towel to squeeze
out the liquid. You will have to do this in batches.
</P>
<P>
   Saute onion in hot oil in nonstick pan until it is hot and
beginning to brown. In large bowl, combine onion with parsley,
oregano, salt, pepper and squash. Slightly beat egg and whites and
stir in. Stir in buttermilk and cheese, and bread crumbs if using.
Spoon mixture into a buttered 1 1/2-quart casserole, cover and
refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, remove casserole from the refrigerator and let sit at
room temperature about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
Bake casserole for about 45 minutes, or until mixture is bubbly.
Serve hot.

 &HT;    CLINTON THREATENS TO VETO BILL WITH TAX-FREE EDUCATION ACCOUNTS
 &HT;    By KEN FOSKETT
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prospects for substantive education reform this
year faded Wednesday as President Clinton and congressional
Republicans hardened their opposition to each other's competing
proposals to fix American education.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., Wednesday threatening to veto legislation sponsored by Sen.
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., that would establish tax-free savings
accounts for primary and secondary education. The House is expected
to vote final passage of the measure Thursday, and the Senate is
likely to vote next week.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell's legislation would allow parents, guardians and even
corporations and unions to set aside up to $2,000 per year in
tax-free savings accounts. Money from the accounts could be used to
finance public school expenses such as books, computers and tutors,
or private school tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials estimate that 70 percent of the children
who set up and used the accounts would be in the public school
system. But because parents with children in private schools would
be expected to use them more, half the money set aside in the
accounts would be spent in private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The accounts ``would weaken public education and short-change
our children,'' Clinton said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the House of Representatives passes this bill, the American
people will have the right to say, 'Thanks for nothing,' ``
Education Secretary Richard Riley said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the House will offer a competing proposal that
would provide tax credits to the purchasers of school construction
bonds, subsidizing about $22 billion in bonds that could be used to
pay for school repairs.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., signaled Wednesday
that Democrats wouldn't seek a compromise involving Coverdell's
legislation and any of the president's education initiatives _ all
of which have been stymied by the Republican-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be happy to compromise, but there is no room for
compromise,'' said Gephardt, blaming Republicans for holding up the
administration's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said his proposal already includes some Democratic
initiatives, such as making state prepaid tuition programs tax-free
and extending $5,250 worth of tax exemptions for employer sponsored
tuition assistance for employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is as close to a compromise as (Clinton) is going
to see,'' Coverdell said. As for Clinton's school rebuilding
program and his plan to spend $20.8 billion over 10 years to reduce
class sizes to 18 pupils per teacher, Coverdell said, ``he spends
money that isn't here.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, at the White House on Wednesday, Clinton announced
$40 million in new grants to fund after-school programs at 315
rural and urban schools. The programs are designed to keep the
children of working parents in school between the hours of 3 p.m.
and 6 p.m., when many are inclined to get into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``For millions of Americans, 'Home Alone' is not a funny movie;
it is a serious risk that children and parents undertake every day
all across this country,'' said Clinton, calling on Congress to
expand funding for the grants to reach up to 500,000 more children.
``These grants will give now thousands more children a safe place
to go before and after school and good things to do.''

PERSONAL POLLS HELP THE NOSEY SATE CURIOSITY

 By PAMELA LI CALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cynthia Lewis, it is fair to say, is an extremely curious
person. In the past five months, she has conducted 44 opinion polls
on questions ranging from the political (``Should President Clinton
be impeached?'') to the personal (``Which smell do you prefer in a
lover?'') to the philosophical (``How often do you behave according
to your ideals?''). So far her polls have prompted more than 2,000
responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like being able to quench my curiosity about any topic under
the sun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis, a senior at Hood College in Maryland, is a regular
participant on a Web site called Survey Central, which lets her
create online polls on any subject she desires
(www.apocalypse.org/bill/survey). The site handles all coding and
tabulation and does things like breaking down answers by sex and
age group. A bulletin-board discussion accompanies each poll.
</P>
<P>
   Survey Central is one of a growing number of sites that allow
Web users to employ some of the tools _ albeit without many of the
statistical methods or the validity of professional polls. Though
it is common to come across personal home pages offering quizzes or
surveys, sites like Survey Central, Open Debate
(www.opendebate.com) and the Internet Voice (www.virtua.com/voice)
seek to centralize and formalize user-created polls.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, they may also give them an aura of legitimacy by
providing greater exposure and snappy interfaces. Visitors remain
anonymous, although these sites typically ask users to register to
insure that they vote only once.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of being part of a mass-media audience, mere
fish in the Nielsen and Arbitron oceans, of seeing public opinion
represented in national polls in which they're never asked to
participate,'' said James Beniger, a professor at the Annenberg
School for Communication at the University of Southern California
and past president of the American Association for Public Opinion
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the technological capabilities inherent in the Internet
to monitor, store, tabulate and calculate, the idea of every man as
his own pollster could hardly come as a surprise. There's an
empowerment aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   Beniger's analysis aptly describes Andy Lee, founder of Open
Debate and a computer science Ph.D. student doing research on
artificial intelligence. Lee said he felt alienated, even betrayed,
by current modes of opinion polling. ``Polls are not conducted in
the public interest,'' he said. ``Many polls are conducted by
political offices, each with its own agenda. To me, the ideal poll
is taken in an open forum after everyone has a chance to discuss
the issue with one another.''
</P>
<P>
   As its name suggests, Open Debate combines discussion and
voting. Lee's idea is to give voters as much information as
possible about the person who framed the poll so they can discern
any bias, and let voters comment at length about the poll itself.
To that end, Open Debate asks users to fill out a profile before
they can vote or create polls. Besides age, sex, location and
occupation, the profile seeks information on a user's religious,
political and philosophical preferences.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Survey Central, which does not seek advertising, nor
Open Debate, which does, censors polls that might be considered
offensive or merely inane. Bill Marrs, creator of Survey Central
and a software developer, said voters tended to give such polls
``the treatment they deserve.'' His site lets users vote on the
quality of individual polls. ``This has turned out to be a highly
effective characteristic of the site,'' Marrs said.
</P>
<P>
   User-created polls cover an enormously wide range of topics,
with an accent on the personal. Ms. Lewis said she especially
enjoyed ``surveys which ask questions people don't normally find
socially appropriate or about topics which people find difficult to
talk about, like suicide or alcoholism. The measure of anonymity
that the Net provides allows users to be more forthright and honest
than they would be if asked the same questions in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone interested in viewing all the polls Ms. Lewis has created
on Survey Central must register first and then search by her user
name, elijahblue. For the record, voters in her polls preferred
their lovers' ``natural scent'' by a wide margin over ``no odor''
and ``perfume/cologne.'' Most do not think that Clinton should be
impeached, nor do they think that it is easy to live up to one's
ideals, two findings that are perhaps related.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the create-your-own-poll sites have attracted modest
audiences. Open Debate has more than 500 registered users and
Survey Central nearly 250. Anywhere from 20 to 50 new polls are
typically created on each site each week. The founders of these
sites shy away from making grandiose claims about the value of
their polls and from projecting their results onto the larger
population.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gisselbrecht, a research technician studying muscle
development in fruit flies, has created about 15 polls on Survey
Central, including ``How do you feel about animal testing?'' and
``Is there a particular song that gets stuck in your head?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Survey Central is a way to poll a certain well-defined
group,'' Gisselbrecht said. ``This is otherwise a very difficult
thing to do. And as an unexpected fringe benefit, it's quite a nice
little community.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls of self-selected audiences appear to be on the rise, and
not just on the Web. Beniger of the University of Southern
California said that while ``amateur Web polls are completely
unscientific,'' they are ``no worse than the so-called call-in
polls perpetrated by many television and radio stations or the
polls by printed ballots published in many magazines and
newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike these, professional polls select their audiences using
statistics that allow the survey results to be representative of
the larger population.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may well be something that public-opinion
researchers can learn from sites like Survey Central. For instance,
professional polls of the general population ``rarely if ever ask
users to rate them,'' Beniger said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he was optimistic that such sites might provide a
window into what topics people were really interested in, as
opposed to those topics selected by professionals and their
commercial or political sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, create-your-own poll sites seem to be
functioning as a salve for those, like Gisselbrecht, are
``tormented by curiosity.'' And unlike professional pollsters,
Gisselbrecht said, ``I've never tried to use the results to
convince anyone of anything.''

SHERRY TURKLE: AT THE HEART OF A CYBERSTUDY, THE HUMAN ESSENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 (ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (bl)  
 By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sherry Turkle began to study the interaction of humans with
computers in the late 1970s. Her first book on the topic, ``The
Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit,'' was published in
1984.
</P>
<P>
   A professor of the sociology of science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, Dr. Turkle is also a licensed clinical
psychologist who has studied psychoanalytic theory extensively.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Turkle, 50, has made a specialty of interviewing people
about their experiences with computers and the Internet. Over the
years, she has amassed a wealth of observations about the effect of
computers and the Internet on adults, teen-agers, children,
technical novices and experts alike.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Turkle's most recent book, ``Life on the Screen: Identity in
the Age of the Internet,'' published by Simon &AMP; Schuster in 1995,
was the product of years of interviews with people who spend a lot
of their time on the Net, for whom reality, as one of Dr. Turkle's
interview subjects put it, ``is just one more window.'' Dr. Turkle
was an early proponent of the idea, now commonly accepted, that
identity on the Internet is fluid.
</P>
<P>
   This interview was conducted via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was it that first got you interested in the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   A. For over a decade, I studied the psychology of people
interacting with computers, where the focus of my work was the
relationship between person and machine. In the late 1980s, I
realized that the focus of my work had to shift _ increasingly
people were using computers to interact with other people.
</P>
<P>
   There are some people who use the Net to act out. That is, they
use this new medium to express the unresolved conflicts in their
lives, to run the ``old tapes'' in unproductive ways. But there are
other people who are able to use this medium to work through
issues, who are able to use the Net to effect change in their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is it about the Net that allows people to make changes
in their lives?
</P>
<P>
   A. When people are on line, they tend to express different
aspects of themselves in different settings. A businessman might
call himself Armaniboy on one mailing list and Motorcycleman on
another. They begin to move fluidly among them and have an
experience that encourages them to challenge traditional ways of
thinking about identity. They find ways to think about a healthy
self not as single and unitary, but rather as having many aspects.
People come to see themselves as the sum of their distributed
presence on the windows they open on their screens. And the
computer serves as a metaphor for thinking about the self: the
technical metaphor of cycling through computer windows has become a
way to think about the relationships among aspects of the self.
</P>
<P>
   I think that when a new technology comes on the scene, it is
natural to first think about it in terms of its instrumental
effects, what it can do for us. Only with some time and distance do
people tend to turn to its subjective effects, what it does to us
as people. I think that we are just at this point now with the
computer, as people come to realize that this technology offers
dramatic new possibilities for personal growth, for developing
personal senses of mastery, for forming new kinds of relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Whitman said, ``A child went forth every day and the first
object he look'd upon, that object he became.'' We make our
technologies, and our technologies shape us in turn. Behind the
strong feeling about Microsoft may be a growing realization that
computers change the way we think, so Microsoft is a company whose
esthetic, as expressed in its operating system, is shaping our
style of thought.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the variability of identity on the Net a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   A. In the best of cases, looking at one's life on the screen
causes one to reflect on the self and on what one seems to desire,
what seems to be missing, what seems to be gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in some cases, what people experience in the online
world is disquieting or disturbing. But here again, the most
constructive response is to use this experience as grist for the
mill for thinking about the rest of one's life.
</P>
<P>
   Some think that we have moved from a psychoanalytic to a
computer culture in terms of how we think of our minds, from
``Freudian slips'' to information-processing errors. But the
reality is more complex _ to understand identity on the Internet,
we would be better served by combining both perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have often talked about the computer as an ``object to
think with'' for thinking about the self. What do you mean by this?
</P>
<P>
   A. When I write about the computer as an ``object to think
with'' or an ``evocative object'' for thinking about the self, I am
pointing to the many ways in which the computer poses questions
about the nature of the self. The computer is a marginal or
boundary object, a mind that is not quite a mind; it does not
really ``think,'' yet it is in some sense a psychological machine.
It is the existence of the computer on the boundary that causes
people to reflect on what they themselves are, how they are like
and not like the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have often said that you dislike the phrase ``Internet
addiction.'' Why?
</P>
<P>
   A. The term addiction is most usefully saved for experiences
with substances like heroin, which are always dangerous, always
bad, always something to turn away from. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Internet offers experiences in which people discover things
about themselves, good and bad, usually complicated and hard to
sort out. People grow and learn and discover new potential. People
also discover preoccupations and fantasies that they may have never
dealt with before and which may be very troubling. If you call the
Internet addicting, then you have to call all powerful, evocative
experience addicting.
</P>
<P>
   I think that many of our anxieties about the Internet are a
displacement of other anxieties about the power of technology in
our lives. People feel that computers are getting out of control,
and they fear they can do nothing about it. Then they seize on the
Internet and imagine that this is a place where they can exert
control. So they focus on censorship, on pornography, on filters.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, people despair about the state of education and look
to the Internet for a technological fix. It would be better if we
faced our real fears.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. What are you working on now?
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm working on ways in which the computer is beginning to
impinge on our notions of bodies and what a body can be.
</P>
<P>
   To take one case: at MIT, researchers are using computers that
they wear on their bodies not only as tools or as prosthetics but
in the spirit of trying to recreate themselves as cyborgs, humans
enhanced by technology. Indeed, they call themselves cyborgs. I
want to understand the changes in identity when people experience a
much more fluid boundary between themselves and technology.
</P>
<P>
   This year I have been teaching a course on the question of
people's relationships with ``objects'' and how objects carry
ideas, how objects are invested with emotion, how objects enter
into cognitive and emotional development. The students in this
course studied computational objects (such as the ``virtual
bodies'' of programs like The Visible Man and Woman), online
``tombstones'' (new, highly evocative spaces for marking a death)
and maps, and we contrasted these kinds of objects with their
``physically embodied'' analogs.
</P>
<P>
   This, too, is another part of my new interest in the issue of
embodiment. I am working toward a book that looks at these
embodiment questions. Next year I am bringing psychoanalysts into
this course, something of a break with the MIT culture, but I think
that this will enrich the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You've worked quite a bit with children. How has the Internet
changed children's lives?
</P>
<P>
   A. Over the past 20 years, the objects of children's lives have
come to include machines of even greater intelligence, toys and
games and programs that make the first cybertoys seem primitive in
their ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Today's children are growing up with ``psychological machines,''
the computers that are so much a part of their lives. They have
become accustomed to the idea that objects that are not alive might
nonetheless have a psychology and even consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Most adults still find the idea of a machine with consciousness
to be a contradiction in terms and deeply disturbing even to
contemplate. I believe that today's children will grow up with very
different feelings and thus be in a different frame of mind when
forming relationships with computers.
</P>
<P>
   They will be more likely to take the machines ``at interface
value,'' that is, to accept them as dialogue partners, even as
companions of a sort.

 CD-ROMs TO ENRICH A FAMILY'S PRESENT WITH ITS PAST  
 (Circuits)  
 (bl)  
 By SHELLY FREIERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service     &HT;    I was at a big family party. Richard, one of my older brothers,
leaned toward me and said quietly, ``OK, the brunette in the red
blouse talking to cousin Harold _ one of Mattie's daughters,
right?'' ``I think so,'' I answered. ``The one with the twins,
right?'' We wanted to ask our mother but could not find her.
 &HT;    So we did the next best thing. We searched our family tree:
three legal-size pages, stapled in one corner and crammed with
eight decades' worth of Levines. First, we found Aunt Sarah and
then Mattie, her four daughters and their eight children. By
process of elimination _ ``See, those are the twins, and they have
one older sister'' _ we settled on Rhona as our mystery cousin. My
mother appeared and confirmed our detective work with a roll of her
eyes.
 &HT;    I made the first family tree in 1984. Harry Levine, my family
patriarch, arrived in New York from what was then Bielsk, Poland,
in 1912, following his two sons, the oldest of 10 children. Four
more children came over before World War I, but their mother,
Pauline, struggled through the war in Europe and did not arrive in
America with the four youngest children until 1920.
 &HT;    When I set about tracing the descendants of Harry and Pauline, I
did it by painstakingly figuring out the spacing on a word
processor. Richard tackled the next one two years ago, this time
using a chart-drawing program on a PC. But now, with several new
children in the sixth generation pushing our family total past 250,
it seems a good time to harness the power of a CD-ROM.
 &HT;    Family tree software is more than a tool to draw family trees.
These programs are supercharged versions of keepsake albums and
family bibles _ a place to record the history of a family, with
births, marriages, deaths and stories. In addition, the CD-ROMs
organize a database for information like occupations, addresses and
medical histories, all of which can be printed in digital albums
along with scanned photographs.
 &HT;    The software also offers lessons in genealogy, historic
databases and links to Internet sites, and some can even
incorporate pieces of audio or video.
 &HT;    You will probably never use all the features on any given
program. All my own extended family needs is a basic family tree
and an updated mailing list. But these CD-ROMs will be useful for
people who are just starting out on a genealogical search.
 &HT;    When I confessed to Mattie (my first cousin once removed) that I
sometimes got her daughters mixed up, she said she could not always
remember my nieces' names. No matter. We chatted about the next
family gathering, and I made a note to add her newest grandchild to
the family tree.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    (STORY ENDS HERE. OPTIONAL SIDEBAR FOLLOWS)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SOME GENEALOGY PROGRAMS
 &HT;    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serious Tool For Searches
</P>
<P>
   ULTIMATE FAMILY TREE PREMIERE  &QL; 
(Palladium Interactive; $59.95; Windows 3.1 and 95.)
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate Family Tree, like all the family tree programs, begins
with one person, whose name, sex, birth, death and significant
events, like date of marriage, are entered into a template. The
next individual is connected to that person as a spouse, parent,
sibling or child, and they are connected to other relatives, and so
on, until a family tree is built.
</P>
<P>
   For these evaluations, I entered the family of Morris Levine,
Harry and Pauline's third child and my maternal grandfather, into
each program. From Morris, who was born in 1890 and died in 1962,
to Aliya, born in Texas in December 1997 and adopted into our
family in February, there is a thread linking 76 people.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogy forms the underlying structure of all family tree
software. For users who plan to conduct a rigorous genealogical
search for ancestors and lost relatives, Ultimate Family Tree is
the best choice. Its structure, vocabulary and tutorials are
closely aligned with formal genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it lets users create an extensive database of
records, like all the programs, but also allows them to rate the
facts for historical accuracy, based on the types of sources and
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate contains tutorials on locating original records and
tracing immigrant ancestors and the ability to include audio and
video files. Like most other family tree programs, it has a Social
Security death index that can be searched for birth and death dates
of relatives and the states in which the numbers were issued. In a
genealogical search, knowing where a relative was born may lead to
other kin.
</P>
<P>
   Once a family database is complete, it can be converted into a
family tree or several kinds of reports. For example, Ultimate will
produce a tree showing the descendants of Morris Levine or all of
my ancestors, or a list of how all of my kin are connected to me.
</P>
<P>
   This CD-ROM also has a very valuable feature for ancestor
hunters looking for family before Ellis Island: a form letter,
addressed to the appropriate authorities in the appropriate foreign
language to request records in non-English-speaking countries like
Germany, France, Sweden and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimate Family Tree may be set up for detailed genealogy
research, but it is inflexible when it comes to describing
relationships in contemporary extended families. Since genealogy is
defined by direct bloodlines, it is impossible to include some
relatives in a family tree. For example, my nephew Gabriel Pagano
was entered into the database as the son of my sister-in law, but
because he is not a blood relative, he didn't appear on a tree
showing the descendants of Morris Levine. The only way to include
him in the family tree was by cheating: I re-entered him, using his
last name but listing him as my brother's son, a blood relative.
</P>
<P>
   In another quirk of the program, an attempt to list two men or
two women as spouses calls up dialogue boxes that read in part: ``A
female has been linked to the father role.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Flexible System That Is Easy to Use
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY HERITAGE DELUXE
</P>
<P>
   (Mindscape; $19.99; Windows 95 and NT.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the family-tree programs reviewed here, Family Heritage
Deluxe stands out for its uncomplicated interface and ease of use.
The template for entering information about an individual is
designed for simple navigation between a person and his or her
closest relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The names of a person's parents, spouse and children appear on
the screen on tabs around the box that forms the basic record, so
the records of these relatives can be found quickly.
</P>
<P>
   As with other programs, users choose a person as the starting
point for trees or records. The information can be configured in
several forms, starting with the primary individual: as family
trees or reports on descendants by generation or on direct
relationships among individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The trees can be constructed in vertical or horizontal layouts,
and some of the programs offer fan charts that show a primary
individual's ancestors in concentric circles. Like the other
programs, Family Heritage can generate calendars, mailing lists and
albums. Users choose the information to include in a tree, calendar
or report, including pictures and notations.
</P>
<P>
   Other appealing interface features in Family Heritage are the
ability to enter a person's spouse and children in one list. Most
family tree software requires users to return to the parent's basic
record to add another child. This CD-ROM lets users fully integrate
children who are not blood relatives in a family tree: I included
my nephew Gabriel by using an option to link him to my brother.
</P>
<P>
   Entering same-sex spouses does not prompt a dialogue box with
Family Heritage, and the program is more contemporary in its
treatment of spouses. Choices in its records qualify ``spouses'' as
married, partner, common law or friend, and options for the end of
a relationship include separated and estranged. But, strangely,
``dead'' is not a choice, so the user needs to choose ``other'' for
a deceased spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Family Heritage, which was purchased by Mindscape in March, is
scheduled to be released in a new version, Family Tree Creator
Deluxe, in September.
</P>
<P>
   I tried one of its current research accessories, a history of
surnames. I looked up Levine, and the excerpt explains the
derivation of the name and mentions the author Primo Levi, whose
name is one of the many spelling variations of Levine. The name is
also ranked 710th in popularity in the Social Security index.
However, a sort of statistical disclaimer points out that since the
index is sorted by only the first five letters of a name, it may
not be accurate: if the Levins and Levinsons were dropped from the
count, we might plummet in popularity to 823th place.
</P>
<P>
   2 Family-Tree Aids Add Useful Options to Basic Approach &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GENERATIONS DELUXE
</P>
<P>
   (Sierra Home; $49.95; Windows 3.1 and 95.)
</P>
<P>
   FAMILY TREE MAKER DELUXE EDITION 3
</P>
<P>
   (Broderbund; $82; Windows 3.1 and 95; Macintosh Power Mac.)
</P>
<P>
   Generations Deluxe and Family Tree Maker Deluxe Edition 3 are
basic programs with similar templates for entering data and share
most of the features of Family Heritage Deluxe and Ultimate Family
Tree.
</P>
<P>
   Generations has a slightly rigid format: it identifies each
family member as half of a married couple in the basic record
screen. And while it allows a user to customize the events to list
for an individual, that new format for events is then included on
everyone's basic record. So, listing immigration and naturalization
as events for my grandfather Morris locked me into those topics for
his great-grandchildren, too.
</P>
<P>
   The interface in Generations offers users a chance to
illustrate, in different colors, the status of children in a
family. I was able to circle the names of my twin cousins in yellow
so they stood out among their four siblings.
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM also has an ancestor overview feature on the tool bar
that opens a box on the screen showing ancestral relationships for
a given individual: that offers a quick look at a family and an
easy navigation shortcut to a distant great-grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   Generations allows users to pass along the historical data,
family trees and reports they have compiled to other family members
by copying the information to disks. Recipients can see the
information on their computers, with read-only access.
</P>
<P>
   Family Tree Maker also has a straightforward and somewhat rigid
interface, with paired husband-wife records on a family page and
tabs connecting parents and children. Navigation is cumbersome: to
get from one sibling to another, you have to click back up to the
parent level.
</P>
<P>
   Events listings do not include pull-down menus of topics like
baptisms, bar mitzvahs or education, so information other than
addresses and medical or adoption histories is entered in a blank
``facts'' table.
</P>
<P>
   Users can include sound and images in albums they create using
Family Tree Maker Deluxe. Two extensive databases are also
included.
</P>
<P>
   The first, called World Family Tree, is a collection of 27,000
family trees in a set of five CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   The second is an index of 130 million names from various
historical databases, including World Family Tree and Social
Security, and marriage and land records. Sometimes in genealogical
searches, finding an exact date or the name of a missing ancestor
can help fill in a branch of a family.

REPLAYING, OR TWISTING, BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two questions about the past. One is, What happened?
The other is, What could have happened?
</P>
<P>
   History answers the first. Historical simulations answer the
second. If different decisions had been made, if different actors
had been on the stage, would it all have turned out another way? Or
were insurmountable forces guiding the course of events?
</P>
<P>
   Answering these questions is a good game. If you're in academia,
it's called counterfactual history. If you're browsing through an
electronics boutique, it's called Sid Meier's Gettysburg. Meier, a
longtime game designer who created landmark computer simulations
like Civilization and Railroad Baron, has ventured into Ken Burns
territory this time and made one of our national legends into a
scenario machine.
</P>
<P>
   In the game, there are three modes of historical authenticity:
Historical, Mixed and Random. If you play in Historical mode and
make the same decisions as the Civil War commanders, you will
re-enact the Battle of Gettysburg. If you play in Random mode, the
game's interlocking scenarios may diverge radically from the events
of July 1863. They may bear no resemblance to any historical event.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the reshuffling of circumstances generates
new ways to replay history. Do it differently. Do it from the other
side. See what might have happened. Or why things didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in with an agenda sometimes and say, `This is my
chance to do it the way it should have been done,' '' Meier said.
``And as they play the game, what we're trying to do is show them a
little more about what was really involved _ how battles actually
work. I know in my reading it's hard to imagine being in a
situation where there's so much going on. Decisions have to be made
quickly. You have to react to new information. Some things you can
only appreciate by actually being there and doing them. Being a
commander in a battle is one of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to read about weapons, tactics and terrain. It's
another to call in reinforcements and have them arrive too late, or
to learn that an artillery unit can ``retreat by recoil,'' moving a
few yards back after every round, or that even severely outnumbered
men, if positioned on the crest of a hill or hidden among trees,
can prevail over a larger force.
</P>
<P>
   In the analog world, only war buffs find this stuff interesting.
In a computer game, the footnotes come to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think of the Civil War as a bunch of guys standing
on a battlefield shooting at each other,'' Meier said. ``But there
were really some pretty powerful psychological factors that come
into play if you're a soldier in battle. If you create a formation
where you have your units supporting each other, one next to the
other, that's a powerful formation because psychologically, a
soldier was much more likely to stay on the battlefield if he had
his friends next to him. On the other hand, if you're able to bring
some of your troops on the flank of the enemy where you can shoot
at them and they can't shoot at you, psychologically that's a very
bad situation for the other side. So they will rout and leave the
field, even though they have not taken a lot of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you start to understand in playing the game that it's not
about who can shoot the fastest or things like that. There are some
interesting psychological aspects to battle that you as a commander
can control and affect.''
</P>
<P>
   If you bind all these elements with beautiful graphics and an
easy-to-use interface, you have a great game. The question is, What
is the difference between a historical simulation and history?
</P>
<P>
   In a simulation, historical accuracy is just another parameter,
like volume, brightness and contrast. On one side of the dial is
the kind of truth you find in clocks and motors and chemistry
experiments. On the other is the kind of truth you find in novels.
</P>
<P>
   In between, you have something that looks real, that feels
testable and that seems capable of making predictions. This is the
sort of model that multinational corporations and government
agencies use to predict the future.
</P>
<P>
   If you're an oil company or the Defense Department and you want
to predict the future, it makes sense to build a scenario machine
that generates every possible outcome, because the future is still
in flux. A game is useful in this context because no one knows how
it ends.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens when you start applying those algorithms to the
past? What happens if simulations become our way of understanding
what has already occurred? When educators realize that children
will learn more about Gettysburg from Sid Meier's software than
from a textbook chapter and chalk-and-board lecture, what then?
</P>
<P>
   What happens when history becomes a game?
</P>
<P>
   A book is a tool. A map is a tool. Games can be a tool. But they
are a curious sort of tool because if they're well designed, they
become ends in themselves. They substitute for the things they're
meant to represent. The map becomes the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Because you, the player, are making decisions, the outcome feels
like a consequence of your actions. And it is _ but only within the
confines of the game. All models make assumptions. But because a
computer simulation generates so many solutions, its assumptions
are difficult to discern. You have to play it 40 different ways
before you know what the model makers take for granted.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as simple as pointing to a passage in a textbook and
saying, No, that's not right and this is why. In a simulation, the
past may seem more immediate, more meaningful and more clear. But
the history behind it is complex and opaque. History turns into
something like a computerized car _ simple to use and impossible to
fix.
</P>
<P>
   Automotive technicians are listed in the phone book. But who are
you going to call when your history breaks down?

<P>
   Forget solitaire. The new Electromagnetic Poetry Kit is a much
better and more creative way to kill time at work, allowing you to
get in touch with your inner E.E. Cummings. It is almost as easy to
install as setting up its analog cousin, which adorns countless
refrigerators with movable magnetic words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an obvious spinoff,'' said Dave Kapell, who invented
the original Poetry Kit, which has become an $8 million enterprise,
in 1993 when he was a songwriter suffering a bout of writer's
block. Back then, he wrote words on slips of paper and laid them
out on a cookie sheet. When a sneeze knocked the words out of
order, inspiration struck.
</P>
<P>
   Two million kits later, Kapell, who is 36 and lives in
Minneapolis, is hoping to dominate what he calls another ``temple
of the household'': the desktop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of the digital version of the kit are clear:
Users can toss in handfuls of words from 30 word lists, allowing
them to merge such disparate interests as golf, legalese,
college-speak and even words in French, Spanish and German.
</P>
<P>
   Digital poets grab the desired word as it floats by at an
adjustable speed, adding a touch of surrealism to the poetic
process. The background can be changed, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in love, you can make a love poem,'' Kapell said.
``Or if you're morose, you can add death words.'' Or you can fuse
the two, and then add the words that have to do with golf.
</P>
<P>
   Another improvement over the kitchen-based version: Poets can
print out their creations or turn them into screen savers.
</P>
<P>
   The Electromagnetic Poetry Kit can be downloaded from the Web
(www.emagoe.com) for $25; there's also a free 30-day trial version
available. The software can also be ordered from (800) 370-7697 for
$29.95.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence that his product stimulates creativity, Kapell
points to a recent discovery by one of his employees, a fan of the
pop singer Madonna, who noticed that the words in one of her new
songs looked awfully familiar. Madonna's publicist denied that she
had used one of the kits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't trying to do anything about it,'' Kapell said. ``We
just wanted to show that the tool was used for its intended
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapell himself has always needed a jump-start when it comes to
free verse. ``Poetry does not come naturally to me,'' he said.
``The boiled-down-to-its-essence kind of writing is something I
need to trick myself into.''
</P>
<P>
   But he finds it easy to come up with words for the kit. ``I'm
always writing down words on the back of my hand, words that are
evocative, that are just fun to say. Sometimes they don't have good
connotations, like melanoma, sausage, bruise.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't worry about causing a decline in work-place
productivity. At the office, poetry is a luxury, Kapell said, but
the kit is a sort of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really do have a need for good, strong, potent
language,'' he said. ``People really want to go deeper _ people
want to write and play with words.''

   Those who did log on saw the birth from the woman's point of
view. One of the network's regular hosts gave play-by-play
commentary as the woman was injected with a hormone to induce labor
and while she sat on a large plastic birthing ball. The coverage
continued through the delivery of a boy weighing 7 pounds 8 ounces.
</P>
<P>
   Live birth on the Web? Shocking? Actually, the surprise is that
it hasn't happened earlier, or more often. In fact, the network's
claim to be the first to broadcast a birth live over the Net has
been disputed. A woman in Colorado says she did much the same thing
in February but restricted her viewers to 150 friends and family
members.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is, after all, an exhibitionist's haven. Voyeurs
around the world can watch people brushing their teeth, watering
their plants, getting married and having sex. Childbirth had to
make it to the Web sooner or later.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the health network said they were showing the birth
to help educate expectant mothers, but there were doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of educational material out there,'' said Dr.
Kimberley Mulvihill, an obstetrician and gynecologist who writes
for Thrive Online, a Web-based health and life style magazine. ``I
think this is more of an attention-getting stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   As educational material for first-time mothers, the birth had
limited value. The health network picked a 40-year-old woman for
her history of easy births. (She would only let her first name be
used, to protect her privacy, of course.) The delivery took just
four hours, and the mother's distress was limited to a few groans.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the lesson first-time mothers are to take away _ have
your baby before lunch and kick back the rest of the day _ then
perhaps the spin doctors at America's Health Network know something
the rest of the childbearing world doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps next, a death, as an instructional aid for first
timers. &QL;

   For months, Microsoft has billed Windows 98 as a move toward
software simplicity and automated technical support, but the
company doesn't seem to believe its own claims. In anticipation of
the operating system's arrival on retailers' shelves next week,
Microsoft has increased its technical support staff by 400, to more
than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has been touting Windows 98 features that help
customers diagnose and fix problems without making support calls.
Nonetheless, said Kim Akers, a Windows 98 product manager, ``we
wanted to ensure that if people did run into problems they couldn't
solve themselves, they'd be able to have those addressed quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Beta versions of the new operating system have been in users'
hands in volume since last December, and tkhow many calls for
technical support have already been received. Ms. Akers said that
compared to Windows 95, the number of calls for help with basic
installation has declined ``dramatically.'' Windows 98, she said,
also appears to cause fewer crashes than Windows 95 did.
</P>
<P>
   Typical calls for Windows 98, said Ms. Akers, have to do with
configuration problems, such as setting up a machine to work with a
network. ``Also, people are calling to say they read about a
feature and can't find it, or can't make it work,'' said Ms. Akers.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it has also improved its Web-based support
area, called Support Online. Windows 98 contains a feature called
WebHelp that connects directly to Support Online.
</P>
<P>
   Technical support calls are free for 90 days after the first
call, and $35 per call thereafter. Support on the Microsoft Web
site is always free, said Ms. Akers. &QL;

   Conventional wisdom regarding women and their Internet habits
has them logging on to shop and schmooze. But a paper to be
released by Vanderbilt University's Project 2000, an electronic
commerce program at the Owen Graduate School of Management,
questions those and other assumptions about what women do online.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors examined a handful of existing studies,
looking for consistent support of several widespread beliefs: Women
go on the Net seeking relationships; women are uncomfortable with
technology; women love to shop, and are drawn to the Web by
cosmetics and clothing, and women don't use online financial
services or products.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found little data in the surveys to support such
stereotypes. ``Although there has been some corroborating research
that indicates that women are interested in relationship aspects of
the online experience,'' wrote the authors, ``there is little in
existing studies to suggest that relationships are as important as
popular belief holds.''
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour convenience of the Net, on the other hand, appears
to be one of the Internet's main draws for women. ``Women said they
enjoyed shopping but more because of the convenience and lack of
sales pressure than because they like makeup,'' said Emily Lyons, a
recent graduate of Vanderbilt's Owen School of Management and one
of the paper's authors.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The paper, titled ``Conventional Wisdoms about Women and
Internet Use: Refuting Traditional Perceptions,'' was written for
iVillage, a commercial site targeted at women and a Project 2000
sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The Vanderbilt research paper also offers recommendations to
online retailers about how best to target women. ``It opens
interesting questions on them,'' said Katie Hawfield, the paper's
other author. ``Perhaps some of the large shopping sites should be
built around a convenience model.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper is one in a series of reports that researchers at
Vanderbilt are doing on the larger issue of diversity on the
Internet. It will be posted Friday on
http://www2000.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu/. &QL;

   The satellite malfunction that left most of the nation's pagers
useless for more than a day earlier this month inspired a group at
the University of Southern California to examine people's
relationship to a device seldom studied as a social phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, which polled people's reactions to being deprived of
their pagers for a day, put numbers to something many have only
suspected: for many people, pagers are far more than a convenience.
They are a vital element of one's day.
</P>
<P>
   The USC study was based on a random telephone survey of 751
households in the Greater Los Angeles area. Of the 250 survey
respondents who reported using pagers, 63 percent said the device
was essential to their work, and 83 percent said that pagers made
their lives easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were suprised by how important a role the pager now plays
in people's lives, both in the household and in the world,'' said
Bill Dutton, a professor at USC's Annenberg School for
Communications. ``Both in the proportion of households that have a
pager, and the number of people who have reorganized their lives
around the pager, so that missing the pager for a day made a big
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutton said his survey clashed with some popular perceptions
about the degree to which a pager is seen as an electronic tether.
``We asked explicitly whether people felt free as a result of not
having their pager for the day. That was true for just 15 to 20
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the respondents said the foul-up had no effect on their
trust in technology. &QL;

<P>
   With a staff of four reporters and two editors, the organization
has a three-year budget of $5.46 million, all from private
donations.
</P>

MARTIN SAGA MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE OLYMPIC CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK FAINARU-WADA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Casey Martin saga is flourishing on the
scared turf of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Till now, there had been mostly talk from afar: in a courtroom,
then on separate golf tours. But Tuesday, two days before the start
of the 98th U.S. Open, Martin rode the fairways of the Olympic Club
and then addressed the news media about his surprising and
ground-breaking presence.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the game's legends told the very same media, with all due
respect to Martin, that they did not think he should be here as
long as he needed a cart to get around.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a Nike Tour regular, is on the PGA Tour this week for
two reasons. First, because four months ago a court allowed that
the rare circulatory disease in his right leg was cause enough for
him to break tradition and use a golf cart. And second, because he
went out and holed a 25-foot putt to win a five-man playoff in
sectional qualifying for the Open.
</P>
<P>
   These events set up a convergence of Martin and a string of pros
who have questioned whether he and his cart cut into the heart of
the game's integrity.
</P>
<P>
   And so there was Martin, defending his presence and insisting he
has no advantage. Sandwiched around him were the likes of Tom
Watson and Jack Nicklaus, both of whom said, essentially, they like
the kid, hate the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen a few of those players that were outspoken,''
Martin said shortly after playing a practice round with Tiger Woods
and Joel Kribel. ``I'm not going to name names, but they didn't go
out of their way to say hi or anything. At the same time, they
didn't sneer at me either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just not going to try to make a big issue out of it and
just try to enjoy the experience. I'm not going to get caught up in
who said what and who is for me and who is against me.''
</P>
<P>
   The general theme from the critics is that they're for Martin,
but against the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tough position the tour has taken, but I think the
tour is right in the sense that the game should be played
walking,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   When Nicklaus was asked about Martin being at the Olympic Club,
he paused for several seconds and then smiled, seemingly somewhat
uncomfortable. Nicklaus was among those who testified against
Martin during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it as it relates to the game of golf,'' Nicklaus
said. ``But I understand the ruling, and from Casey's standpoint I
am delighted for him as an individual. I worry about what its
ramifications are for golf in the future. I mean, you know, is
there somebody else who is injured this week who would like to use
a cart?''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that a regular injury and a disability are two
different animals, Nicklaus said, ``I understand that. But somebody
along the line is going to use (the ruling), I promise you. ...
Someone is going to come in and say, I qualified for the Open but I
sprained my ankle. You are going to have another mess someplace. It
is going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, a close friend of Martin, took sort of the middle ground,
saying, ``I don't really like seeing golf carts out there. But he
is one of my good friends and I want to see him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin tried his best to defuse the whole deal, saying he
respects his critics' opinions, he just doesn't agree with them.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who insist Martin, by virtue of riding rather
than walking, will have a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I am not at an advantage physically over anybody,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The whole scene hasn't been made any easier by the cart itself.
Martin used a specially-made one-man cart during the qualifying and
had problems, and he had more of the same in practice rounds Monday
and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It was finally decided that he would use a basic two-person
cart, which will be allowed only on the fairways. He will stop
about 30 yards short of the greens, at which point a marshal will
take the cart over to the next tee while Martin plays out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am only going to drive on the fairway,'' Martin said. ``I am
not going to be doing curly-cues in the rough to mat it down,
although I'd like to mat it down a bit.''

THE SIMMERING DISPUTE OVER HOW TO FIX RED BEANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a friend who courteously disagrees with all this business
of fancy cooking and intricate recipes. ``Why fuss over cooking so
much?'' he asks. ``If you know how to make red beans and corn
bread, that's all you need to know. I could eat them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to comfort food, red beans are right at the top.
You can cook them soft and creamy, or leave just a little crunch.
They can be spooned over sweet corn bread, or enhanced with fluffy
white rice.
</P>
<P>
   I tend to agree with my friend. A bowl of red beans over corn
bread, with slices of onion and tomato, is a real meal, and if I
had to eat it a couple of times a week, I would survive nicely.
</P>
<P>
   But, do you soak the beans overnight or not? What's the
difference between red beans and pinto beans? If you're fixing red
beans and rice, do you cook the rice in the bean juice, or do you
add the rice later?
</P>
<P>
   And, is it really possible to cook a good bowl of beans without
a ham bone?
</P>
<P>
   There is, it seems, nothing simple about this simple dish.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the answers, it turns out, are purely subjective. There
appears to be no proof that soaking overnight helps the beans cook
up creamier, but don't tell that to the cooks who prefer the
soaking method.
</P>
<P>
   I know soaking isn't supposed to make much difference, but I
still soak mine.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto beans are good, but red beans are really kidney beans, and
they aren't the same. They taste different, and they make a
different gravy. And, just to add to the confusion, there are good
kidney beans, and then there are better kidney beans.
</P>
<P>
   Up at Bayou Boys, a Lewisville food business where Cajun food is
the only commodity, Camellia brand red beans are the only ones the
Cajun cooks use. They've tried other brands, they say, but the
others just don't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bayou Boys uses Camellia beans in its prepared foods
and sells the dried beans in 1-pound packages. It is the only place
in the Fort Worth-Dallas area I know of that sells Camellia-brand
beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried using other beans, the kind you can get around
here, but they are just not the same quality,'' said Rudy Porche,
chef and co-owner of Porche's Restaurant in Fort Worth. ``We grew
up eating Camellia beans, and you just stay with what you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Porche moved to Fort Worth from Baton Rouge and has been
operating Porche's Creole and Cajun Cafe for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   He soaks his beans overnight and closely watches the amount of
water he uses. ``People do it differently,'' he said. ``Some use a
little water, some use so much it turns out more like red bean
gumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, he pointed out, not a bad thing, especially if you
have corn bread around to sop it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret to cooking good beans,'' he said, ``is, don't rush
the cooking process. Go real slow. Let them simmer. If you can let
them simmer all day, that's even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana beans and Texas beans came to popularity in different
ways. Dried pinto beans were easy to carry on chuck wagons on the
Texas ranches. They could be stretched by adding peppers and chili
powder, onions and whatever kind of meat you had available.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana red beans gained their popularity in New Orleans,
where they were paired with rice for a customary Monday meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had them on Mondays,'' Porche said. ``You would
always have a big Sunday dinner, usually ham or something like
that, and you would want to take that ham bone and make something
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to put the ham bone in with the beans and let them
cook all day while the laundry was being done.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe that red beans cannot be cooked without a
ham bone. They insist that the bone be cracked, so the marrow can
meld with the juices and form a silky gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Others, and I fall into this category, believe that a couple of
good-size smoked hocks and a link or two of spicy smoked sausage
can dress up the beans just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you are preparing the true New Orleans mixture, fix the
rice and the beans separately. It's a rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Orleans is famous for red beans and rice,'' said Benson
Hayward of L.H. Hayward &AMP; Co., the company that produces Camellia
brand beans. ``New Orleans is where red beans and rice comes from.
It is still a Monday tradition here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayward's company is in Harahan, a suburb of New Orleans. It is
a small, family-owned company with about 20 employees, he said. It
has been in business for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hayward said the quality of the beans makes them the favorite of
Cajun chefs. ``We look for the upper echelon of quality in the lots
available for purchase. We only buy from certain areas, and we only
buy certain quality. We look for specific moisture content.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Hayward's company does not market its beans
outside southern Louisiana, for the most part. There is one Texas
wholesaler in Sulphur Springs, he said. But Hayward doesn't do
business in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you can't get good red beans at the local
grocery. You just have to be a little more careful how you cook
them. Camellia-brand beans are good. They cook up faster and
creamier than many other brands, but they can be matched if you
follow Porche's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Cook them slowly. Bring the water to a boil, then back off to a
simmer. Let that simmer continue as long as possible. Two hours is
probably the shortest time; all day is best. Keep them covered with
water, and adjust seasonings to your personal taste.
</P>
<P>
   And, if it makes you feel better, soak them overnight before you
begin cooking.

METHAMPHETAMINE ABUSE SURGING AMONG WEIGHT-OBSESSED GIRLS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Three years ago, anecdotal evidence of increased heroin
use among Texas teen-agers set off alarms among addiction
specialists. Despite their warnings, 21 youths in North Texas alone
died in a heroin haze since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Now signs of surging abuse of methamphetamines have the same
drug experts worried. Especially troubling is the growing
popularity of ``meth'' or ``speed'' among young Texans, including
weight-obsessed girls, according to the Texas Commission on Alcohol
and Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   While data is sketchy, the consensus among the experts is that
it's just a matter of time before methamphetamine use among Texas
youths turns deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not epidemic proportions yet, but they've seen the first
blips of indicators _ and it's not unlike the first blips of
indicators they saw about heroin three years ago,'' said Robert
Nash, spokesman for Partnership for a Drug-free Texas, a nonprofit
group that places anti-drug messages in the media.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership on Wednesday launched a national ad campaign to
call attention to methamphetamine abuse, which is most prevalent in
the Southwest, because a major offshore source is Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like never before, you will see a tremendous amount of
anti-drug messages on TV and radio and in the newspapers,
billboards and some movie theaters and on the Internet,'' Nash
said. One of the targets will be young women.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of young women _ girls, even _ are using amphetamines to
stay thin,'' Nash said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year only 51 clients ages 17 or younger were treated for
methamphetamine abuse by TCADA-funded programs. That represents
fewer than 2 percent of the 3,067 juveniles treated for drug or
alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   But even that small number indicates ``meth use among Texas
youth is on the rise,'' the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug
Abuse said, and it can be expected to mirror the increased use of
speed among adults, 5 percent of whom were treated for
methamphetamine abuse last year. (Before 1997, TCADA did not keep
separate records on juveniles treated.)
</P>
<P>
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse said abuse of
methamphetamine can cause heart and brain damage, memory loss,
aggression, brain damage and psychotic behavior
</P>
<P>
   Because the drug is often used intravenously _ although it also
can be snorted or smoked _ its abuse is associated with the
transmission of hepatitis and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, Texas has logged more than 1,200 ``adverse''
effects, including eight deaths, from use of methamphetamines,
whose active ingredient, ephedrine, is commonly found in diet
remedies. Ephedrine-containing dosages ``have been used to get
high, stay awake, lose weight, enhance athletic performance, boost
energy levels or attempt suicide,'' said the commission's report.
</P>
<P>
   Despite anti-drug initiatives, children increasingly are seeking
methamphetamines in any form, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``School-age children consider over-the-counter drug products
containing ephedrine to be `legal' and cheap alternatives to
amphetamines and other illicit stimulants and hallucinogens,'' a
report from TCADA said.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, the drug is ``very popular in the topless bar scene
and around the university,'' the commission said, citing input from
drug counselors, researchers and law enforcement agents. In
Houston, methamphetamines are ``perceived as a substitute for
cocaine and as a palliative for dope sickness,'' the report added.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe Houston has not experienced the upsurge in
methamphetamine abuse that some cities, such as Lubbock, have
witnessed. Commission researcher Jane Marshall said data reflect
``low'' usage of speed in Houston.

THE SIMMERING DISPUTE OVER HOW TO FIX RED BEANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have a friend who courteously disagrees with all this business
of fancy cooking and intricate recipes. ``Why fuss over cooking so
much?'' he asks. ``If you know how to make red beans and corn
bread, that's all you need to know. I could eat them every day.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a point.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to comfort food, red beans are right at the top.
You can cook them soft and creamy, or leave just a little crunch.
They can be spooned over sweet corn bread, or enhanced with fluffy
white rice.
</P>
<P>
   I tend to agree with my friend. A bowl of red beans over corn
bread, with slices of onion and tomato, is a real meal, and if I
had to eat it a couple of times a week, I would survive nicely.
</P>
<P>
   But, do you soak the beans overnight or not? What's the
difference between red beans and pinto beans? If you're fixing red
beans and rice, do you cook the rice in the bean juice, or do you
add the rice later?
</P>
<P>
   And, is it really possible to cook a good bowl of beans without
a ham bone?
</P>
<P>
   There is, it seems, nothing simple about this simple dish.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the answers, it turns out, are purely subjective. There
appears to be no proof that soaking overnight helps the beans cook
up creamier, but don't tell that to the cooks who prefer the
soaking method.
</P>
<P>
   I know soaking isn't supposed to make much difference, but I
still soak mine.
</P>
<P>
   Pinto beans are good, but red beans are really kidney beans, and
they aren't the same. They taste different, and they make a
different gravy. And, just to add to the confusion, there are good
kidney beans, and then there are better kidney beans.
</P>
<P>
   Up at Bayou Boys, a Lewisville food business where Cajun food is
the only commodity, Camellia brand red beans are the only ones the
Cajun cooks use. They've tried other brands, they say, but the
others just don't measure up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bayou Boys uses Camellia beans in its prepared foods
and sells the dried beans in 1-pound packages. It is the only place
in the Fort Worth-Dallas area I know of that sells Camellia-brand
beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've tried using other beans, the kind you can get around
here, but they are just not the same quality,'' said Rudy Porche,
chef and co-owner of Porche's Restaurant in Fort Worth. ``We grew
up eating Camellia beans, and you just stay with what you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Porche moved to Fort Worth from Baton Rouge and has been
operating Porche's Creole and Cajun Cafe for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   He soaks his beans overnight and closely watches the amount of
water he uses. ``People do it differently,'' he said. ``Some use a
little water, some use so much it turns out more like red bean
gumbo.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is, he pointed out, not a bad thing, especially if you
have corn bread around to sop it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret to cooking good beans,'' he said, ``is, don't rush
the cooking process. Go real slow. Let them simmer. If you can let
them simmer all day, that's even better.''
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana beans and Texas beans came to popularity in different
ways. Dried pinto beans were easy to carry on chuck wagons on the
Texas ranches. They could be stretched by adding peppers and chili
powder, onions and whatever kind of meat you had available.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana red beans gained their popularity in New Orleans,
where they were paired with rice for a customary Monday meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had them on Mondays,'' Porche said. ``You would
always have a big Sunday dinner, usually ham or something like
that, and you would want to take that ham bone and make something
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to put the ham bone in with the beans and let them
cook all day while the laundry was being done.
</P>
<P>
   Some people believe that red beans cannot be cooked without a
ham bone. They insist that the bone be cracked, so the marrow can
meld with the juices and form a silky gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Others, and I fall into this category, believe that a couple of
good-size smoked hocks and a link or two of spicy smoked sausage
can dress up the beans just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if you are preparing the true New Orleans mixture, fix the
rice and the beans separately. It's a rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Orleans is famous for red beans and rice,'' said Benson
Hayward of L.H. Hayward &AMP; Co., the company that produces Camellia
brand beans. ``New Orleans is where red beans and rice comes from.
It is still a Monday tradition here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayward's company is in Harahan, a suburb of New Orleans. It is
a small, family-owned company with about 20 employees, he said. It
has been in business for 75 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hayward said the quality of the beans makes them the favorite of
Cajun chefs. ``We look for the upper echelon of quality in the lots
available for purchase. We only buy from certain areas, and we only
buy certain quality. We look for specific moisture content.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Hayward's company does not market its beans
outside southern Louisiana, for the most part. There is one Texas
wholesaler in Sulphur Springs, he said. But Hayward doesn't do
business in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean you can't get good red beans at the local
grocery. You just have to be a little more careful how you cook
them. Camellia-brand beans are good. They cook up faster and
creamier than many other brands, but they can be matched if you
follow Porche's advice.
</P>
<P>
   Cook them slowly. Bring the water to a boil, then back off to a
simmer. Let that simmer continue as long as possible. Two hours is
probably the shortest time; all day is best. Keep them covered with
water, and adjust seasonings to your personal taste.
</P>
<P>
   And, if it makes you feel better, soak them overnight before you
begin cooking.

DEFENDING CHAMP ELS HOPES TO GET BACK UP TO PAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFRI CHADIHA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It wasn't long before Ernie Els squirmed in his
chair, seeking just the right position where his back could enjoy
some relief.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look easy and Els had told a news conference he would
probably conclude quickly because of his ailment. He enters this
year's U.S. Open not only as the defending champion, but also as
one of the players trying to overcome a back injury. Sitting
uncomfortably while answering questions, Els couldn't hide the
extent of his problems Tuesday. Nor did he try.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not 100 percent,'' Els said. ``It's not the way you want
to feel playing in a major tournament, but I am defending here this
week. It feels better than it did last Thursday but it's still a
day-to-day thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The last six days couldn't have provided much worse
circumstances for Els. His back started bothering him the evening
before the first day of the Buick Classic in Westchester, N.Y. The
spasms were so bad that he aborted his participation after nine
holes, the first time he ever failed to finish a round. The pain
was most prominent on the left side of his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   One good sign for Els is that the stiffness has subsided a
little more each day since.
</P>
<P>
   But will his back heal quickly enough to allow Els to play his
best golf this week? If it doesn't, Els will focus more on his next
opportunity than his missed one here. If it does, he stands a good
shot of winning his third U.S. Open in the last five years. (He
also won in 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we don't play too long of a course, I might be
OK,'' Els said. ``Today, I took my driver out probably four or five
times (during his practice round). I used quite a few 2-irons and
3-irons. You have to put the ball in play and take it from there
and that might work to my advantage. As they say sometimes, beware
of the injured golfers.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no mystery behind Els' injury. The long stretches he
spends standing on golf courses, especially during pro-ams, is one
factor. The bigger one is the 28-year-old South African's constant
globetrotting on the international tour. The endless hours Els
spends on long flights aren't something a chiropractor would
suggest for good health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plays in Australia, Europe, Asia,'' Tiger Woods said.
``That's a huge toll on your body.''
</P>
<P>
   Els said that although he felt some pain during Tuesday's
practice round, his back was not stiffening, as it did Friday. His
doctor has prescribed exercises and stretches to help alleviate the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   And he must limit his hitting. He admits it isn't an easy thing
to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do get frustrated,'' Els said. ``I wanted to go out there
and play and practice and get ready for this tournament, but maybe
all these things happen for a reason. Maybe I should slow down a
bit. There will be more U.S. Opens and British Opens. But it is
frustrating because I've been playing well and I feel that my game
is coming around.''

A WEB SITE TO FIGHT CENSORSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Va., Md., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a tribute to the people who have been tortured, burned at the
stake, sent to the Bastille or harassed by J. Edgar Hoover for
exercising their freedom of speech and thought, Banned Books
On-Line offers links to the texts of 30 representative books and
plays, even Scriptures, that have been _ or still are _ kept from
readers by nervous authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a reminder of the irrationality of censorship, the
triumph of ideas and the ultimate irrelevance of thought control
when it can be beaten by the touch of a few buttons.
</P>
<P>
   A reader is soon reminded that Aristophanes' ``Lysistrata,''
Defoe's ``Moll Flanders,'' various editions of ``The Arabian
Nights'' and Chaucer's ``Canterbury Tales'' were all banned from
the U.S. mail for decades under the Comstock Law, an anti-obscenity
statute of 1873. Aristophanes had trouble not only with Victorian
prudes but also with the military dictatorship in Greece, which,
the site notes, censored ``Lysistrata,'' an anti-war play, in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Sanger's 16-page pamphlet ``Family Limitation,'' which
ran afoul of the Comstock Law's ban on birth-control information,
is there with its original pages reproduced, as is Walt Whitman's
``Leaves of Grass.'' Banned Books On-Line contains a link to a site
that chronicles attacks on Mark Twain; ``Huckleberry Finn'' is
still one of the most censored books in American school libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Banned Books On-Line
(www.cs.cmu.edu/People/spok/banned-books.html) was culled from the
indexes of the On-Line Books Page (www.cs.cmu.edu/books.html),
which lists more than 7,000 works. Both sites were created by John
Mark Ockerbloom, 31, who has just received his doctorate in
computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the links to books from Banned Books On-Line go down.
When that occurs, you can go to the On-Line Books Page, where
alternative sites can usually be found.
</P>
<P>
   Ockerbloom said he had been inspired to set up the banned-books
site in 1994, when Carnegie Mellon removed more than 80 newsgroups
on sexual matters from its Web servers. After student and faculty
complaints, he said, the newsgroups were restored to the
university's computer-science Web servers, but a number of them
remain off the undergraduate system.
</P>
<P>
   Don Hale, vice president for university relations, said
questionable newsgroups had indeed been removed from Web servers
controlled by Carnegie Mellon, but he added that they were still
available to anyone on campus through independent servers.
</P>
<P>
   The Comstock Law's provisions are rarely enforced but have never
been entirely repealed, Ockerbloom said, noting recent efforts to
ban abortion information and ``indecent'' material on the Internet.
Opponents of the Communications Decency Act, Congress' first
attempt to ban pornography on the Internet, argued that it was a
modern-day Comstock Law. The act was struck down by the U.S.
Supreme Court last year.
</P>
<P>
   The banned-books site, which Ockerbloom said got several
thousand visits a week, is linked to a number of other
anti-censorship resources, including the Electronic Frontier
Foundation (www.eff.org/blueribbon.html) and the American Civil
Liberties Union's Freedom Network
(www.aclu.org/issues/cyber/burning.html), in a campaign against
Internet censorship.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ockerbloom, representing Banned Books On-Line, is one of eight
plaintiffs in a suit against Loudoun County, Va., which uses a Web
filter to block his site and others from viewing at the public
library. Other censored plaintiffs represent Web sites that include
the Safer Sex Page and the site of the American Association of
University Women Maryland. Rob Morse, a columnist for The San
Francisco Examiner, is also a plaintiff.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ockerbloom's dissertation involved a system to
let Internet users manage large amounts of shared information from
sites that use different formats, without the need to translate
them into a common format.
</P>
<P>
   A Roman Catholic, Ockerbloom also maintains a comprehensive site
called Catholic Resources on the Net
(www.cs.cmu.edu/spok/catholic.html), which is unofficial and not
sponsored by any Catholic organization but has extensive links to
papal doctrine, saints, liturgy, Mary pages, lavish art and much
more.
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally gets angry mail, from ``not just Catholics, but
people in various religions,'' asking him to explain why he runs
sites dedicated to both faith and free thought.
</P>
<P>
   Censorship, Ockerbloom said, endangers democracy by attacking
anything that challenges the status quo. ``It really narrows the
range of discussion in the interest of whoever's in power at the
time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own work, he said, ``what I'm hoping the effect will
be is a lot more kids will go out and read `Huckleberry Finn.'''

A PERSONAL COMPUTER IS NOT ALWAYS A PC
</HEADLINE>
  (Circuits)  
(ja) 
 By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Are all desktop computers considered PCs? Are Apple computers
PCs?
</P>
<P>
   A. A PC, defined in the dictionary as a personal computer, is
designed for an individual to use it to process and store data
electronically, so many devices can be considered PC's. Not
counting the models constructed from hobby kits, PC's have been
around only since 1977, when Apple Computer, Commodore and Radio
Shack began to sell machines that you could buy in stores.
</P>
<P>
   In more technical usage, however, the term PC has come to be
associated with IBM and IBM clones running the DOS or Microsoft
Windows operating systems with an Intel or Intel-compatible
microprocessor. The first PC manufactured by IBM in 1981 was named
the IBM PC, and in the consumer world, PC has also come to mean
``not Macintosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer introduced its Macintosh line in 1984. The first
home computer to feature a graphic interface, the Mac runs on its
own microprocessor and operating system. But Mac users can buy
add-in cards or software that will let them run PC programs on
their machines.  &QL;

   DOLLAR-YEN (Washington) - President Clinton ordered the United

Japan's mounting economic problems _ and its slow response _ were
threatening China and other nations. By David E. Sanger

   OIL-SMUGGLE (Washington) Large volumes of oil are being smuggled
in violation of the sanctions and the Clinton administration is
ignoring it. By James Risen BLAIR-ACCENT (London) _ Tony Blair is a
prime minister who prides himself on his common touch, so there was
nothing particularly surprising about what he said recently on a
British talk show. What was surprising were the Prime Minister's
missing T's? And what happened to his H's? Why, when he tried to

   CONGRESS-TAXES (Washington) _ After years of rhetoric about the
complexities and inequities in the tax code, the House today took a

   AIDS-IMMUNE _ Scientists have visualized the first contact made
between the probe of the AIDS virus and its two target sites on the
surface of a human cell. The visualization also shows how cunning
and multi-faceted the virus's defenses are against attack by the
body's immune system, confirming many researchers' views that the
AIDS vaccine recently approved for testing is unlikely to work. By

LABOR-GM (Flint, Mich.) _ The 12-day-old strike against General
Motors began as a little-watched, local dispute at a single
metal-shaping plant here, but the walkout has quickly snowballed
into a strike of national importance. And although the walkout
involves a tangle of issues, the strike has focused increasingly on
an issue of paramount concern to millions of workers across

   MANZANAR-NATIONAL-SITE (LONE PINE, Calif.) &UR;  &LR; _ The stone sentry
posts stand empty and silent now at Manzanar, their graceful pagoda
shapes a haunting reminder in the desolate high desert here on the

IN SEX-ROLE TANGLE, A WOMAN'S SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do women search for information differently from men?
</P>
<P>
   I never thought so myself _ and in fact, found the notion rather
sexist on its face _ until the other day when I stumbled across an
unusual Web search site called Looksmart that is particularly
popular with women.
</P>
<P>
   During the first five months of this year, Looksmart attracted a
higher percentage of women than the other top search sites,
according to statistics compiled by Craig Ruskin, a research
analyst with Relevant Knowledge, which measures Web traffic.
</P>
<P>
   While other sites' audiences tended to reflect the male-centric
face of the Web (only 44 percent of Web users are women), Looksmart
(www.looksmart.com) consistently attracted a higher proportion of
female users, more than half in three of the previous five months.
</P>
<P>
   When Evan Thornley and Tracey Ellery designed the site three
years ago, they were not trying to target women. ``We started out
to target professional families, busy people, a highly educated
group of folks,'' Ms. Ellery said. ``Our vision was to reach a
mainstream audience on the Web. It turned out that a large
proportion of that audience is women.''
</P>
<P>
   That intrigued me because I have been disappointed by most of my
attempts to find useful information on the Web. No matter what
search site I try _ Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, Lycos, Alta Vista,
Hotbot and the list goes on _ I usually end up frustrated, wading
through screen after screen of long lists of sites unrelated to
what I was searching for, like sites written in German or reams of
personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   But now I had hope. Perhaps the problem all along was that I was
a woman searching for information in a man's environment. I admit
that it sounded a little odd and even self-serving. But Look-smart
has a higher percentage of women users, so it must be doing
something that appeals to them. I mean, us.
</P>
<P>
   When I went to Looksmart to investigate, I noticed a difference.
Although Looksmart offered the usual opportunity to type in a
keyword to conduct a search, the design of the site nudged me in a
different direction.
</P>
<P>
   Looksmart was clearly encouraging me to browse. Along the left
side of the screen was a prominent list of 12 tempting categories
like Travel and Vacations, Business and Finance, and Shopping and
Services. I could click on any of these to begin broad searches.
</P>
<P>
   Idly, I chose Shopping and Services, and that produced a list
with more specific subcategories. To narrow my search, I clicked
again, delving deeper into such subcategories as Clothes and
Accessories and then Women's Wear. I arrived within seconds at a
list of sites labeled rather inelegantly as Footwear.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical of any site that would use such an unevocative label
for the glorious subcategory of shoes, I clicked on the list. Was I
about to be confronted by page after page of socks? Instead, I
found myself happily examining images of actual pairs of shoes by
companies like Kenneth Cole, Steve Madden and Hush Puppies. The
Hush Puppies site even flashed this message: ``Browse our shoes!''
There are no three sweeter words in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   After about a half-hour of comparing heel heights, prices and
options for summer sandals, I tried to make sense of the
experience. I believed that I had been randomly experimenting with
the search site. But when I phoned Thornley and Ms. Ellery and
described my journey, I learned that the pattern of my search had
been no accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ended up using the site to shop,'' Thornley said. ``This
is not unusual, and it is not unlike what people have observed.
Women on average shop in a more browsing context. Men tend to be
more hunters, searching for a specific item.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean that when women are searching for information,
they're really in effect shopping for facts?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important not to overstate the generalizations,''
Thornley cautioned. ``But what we appear to see is that on average,
women are more disposed toward a category approach to searches.''
Looksmart is certainly more disposed toward that approach. While
most search engines rely primarily on software to sort sites
automatically, Looksmart employs a staff of 30 real people to
review each site, write a brief description of it and categorize
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how we give a much more hands-on approach to sifting
through the information,'' Thornley said. ``Yahoo is the only other
site that really does the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But each has an idiosyncratic way of organizing information in
its database. Yahoo's categories (www.yahoo.com) were very
different from Looksmart's. To arrive at a list of Yahoo's shoe
sites, I had to follow a route that was, to my mind, less
intuitive. I clicked first on Business and Economy, then Companies,
then Apparel, then Footwear, then Women's, then Brand Names.
Although Yahoo's database of sites is more than twice as large as
Looksmart's database of 400,000, I preferred browsing on Looksmart.
</P>
<P>
   Since my opinion of browsing was based on personal taste, I
enlisted the aid of Gary Arlen, who heads Arlen Communications, a
company that has studied online shopping patterns. He readily
agreed to act as a sort of scientific control. He and his wife had
been pricing bedding the day before, and he was willing to do some
comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   But Arlen's experience on Looksmart was vastly different from
mine. He narrated his search over the phone in real time: ``I'm
starting at Shopping and Services, then going to Decor and Design,
then searching for bedding, and here's a list for some appropriate
sites. But wait, by the time I get to the sixth or seventh site on
the list, I'm at something called Eco-Baby, and it sells natural
diapers, breast pumps, a whole list of things I'm not interested
in. Oh, wait, _ the last item is bedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlen was disappointed that he had been compelled to wade
through stuff he considered extraneous. ``I'm not convinced
browsing is better,'' he said. But then, he is a man.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the real difference in search techniques is based not
on sex but rather on what you need to find. I enjoy browsing as
much as the next, er, person when I am shopping. But when I am
looking for specific information, like the answer to a question my
7-year-old recently posed _ ``How many babies can a horse have at
once?'' _ I can find the answer much faster by searching with the
keywords ``horse'' and ``facts'' on Yahoo than by using Looksmart.
(The answer is usually one foal, but sometimes two.) Believe me:
even after hours of browsing, I can still type as fast as any man.

   &UR; THIS ONE (ITAL) HAS (UNITAL) TO BE DIRTY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A Frenchman and an Italian were seated next to an American in an
overseas flight. After a few cocktails, the men began discussing
their home lives.
</P>
<P>
   `Last night I made love to my wife four times,` the Frenchman
bragged, `and this morning she made me delicious crepes and she
told me how much she adored me.`
</P>
<P>
   Ah, last night I made love to my wife six times,` the Italian
responded, `and this morning she made me a wonderful omelet and
told me she could never love another man.`
</P>
<P>
   When the American remained silent, the Frenchman smugly asked,
`And how many times did you make love to your wife last night?`
</P>
<P>
   `Once,` he replied.
</P>
<P>
   `Only once?` the Italian arrogantly snorted. `And what did she
say to you this morning?`
</P>
<P>
   `Don't stop, Don't stop, Don't stop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WORD OF GOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A man trying to understand the nature of God and asked Him:
</P>
<P>
   `God how long is a million years to you?`
</P>
<P>
   And God answered: ` A million years is like a minute.`
</P>
<P>
   Then the man asked: `God, how much is a million dollars to you?`
</P>
<P>
   And God replied: `A million dollars is like a penny.`
</P>
<P>
   Finally the man asked: `God, could you give me a penny?`
</P>
<P>
   And God said, `In a minute.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PERSONAL GROWTH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As I let go of my feelings of guilt, I am in touch with my inner
sociopath.
</P>
<P>
   I have the power to channel my imagination into ever-soaring
levels of suspicion and paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   I assume full responsibility for my actions, except the ones
that are someone else's fault.
</P>
<P>
   I no longer need to punish, deceive, or compromise myself,
unless I want to stay employed.
</P>
<P>
   In some cultures what I do would be considered normal.
</P>
<P>
   Having control over myself is almost as good as having control
over others.
</P>
<P>
   My intuition nearly makes up for my lack of self-judgment.
</P>
<P>
   I honor my personality flaws for without them I would have no
personality at all.
</P>
<P>
   Joan of Arc heard voices too.
</P>
<P>
   I am grateful that I am not as judgmental as all those
censorious, self-righteous people around me.
</P>
<P>
   I need not suffer in silence while I can still moan, whimper,
and complain.
</P>
<P>
   As I learn the innermost secrets of people around me, they
reward me in many ways to keep me quiet.
</P>
<P>
   When someone hurts me, I know that forgiveness is cheaper than a
lawsuit, but not nearly as gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to say nice things about myself. The second,
to do nice things for myself. The third, to find someone to buy me
nice things.
</P>
<P>
   As I learn to trust the universe, I no longer need to carry a
gun.
</P>
<P>
   All of me is beautiful, even the ugly, stupid and disgusting
parts.
</P>
<P>
   I am at one with my duality.
</P>
<P>
   Blessed are the flexible, for they can tie themselves into
knots.
</P>
<P>
   Only a lack of imagination saves me from immobilizing myself
with imaginary fears.
</P>
<P>
   I honor and express all facets of my being, regardless of state
and local laws.
</P>
<P>
   Today I will gladly share my experience and advice, for there
are no sweeter words than `I told you so!`
</P>
<P>
   False hope is better than no hope at all.
</P>
<P>
   A good scapegoat is almost as good as a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Who can I blame for my problems? Just give me a minute ... I'll
find someone.
</P>
<P>
   Why should I waste my time reliving the past when I can spend it
worrying about the future?
</P>
<P>
   The complete lack of evidence is the surest sign that the
conspiracy is working.
</P>
<P>
   I am learning that criticism is not nearly as effective as
sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming aware of my character defects leads me naturally to the
next step of blaming my parents.
</P>
<P>
   To have a successful relationship I must learn to make it look
like I'm giving as much as I'm getting.
</P>
<P>
   I am willing to make the mistakes if someone else is willing to
learn from them.
</P>
<P>
   Before I criticize a man, I walk a mile in his shoes. That way,
if he gets angry, he's a mile away and barefoot.

ROSE CRUMB OF PORT ANGELES, WASH., HONORED AT SUPREME COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by the New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 The Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hospice care crusader Rose Crumb, winner of the
1998 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Award for her public service
achievements, on Wednesday thanked the families of her patients for
showing her ``what a very precious gift life is.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumb, who founded the volunteer Hospice of Clallam County,
Wash., in 1978, said she has learned ``courage, patience and
acceptance'' by working with families to provide their dying
relative with a dignified end.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made me realize what a very precious gift life is, and
that we need to make the most of it every day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Crumb, one of five national winners of the Onassis award, was
selected for the honor from among 42 recipients of the 1998
Jefferson Awards, which recognize community contributions across
the nation. Crumb and the other four recipients were honored
Wednesday at a ceremony at the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was hosted by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who
called the award recipients ``true American heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still true today that the single individual can make a
difference,'' O'Connor said. ``These individuals show that
volunteerism is alive and well in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumb, 72, was sponsored for the award by The Seattle
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson awards, dubbed ``America's Nobel Prizes for Public
Service,'' are presented by the American Institute for Public
Service. The institute was created in 1972 by Onassis, Sen. Robert
Taft Jr., and Sam Beard to honor individuals for public service.
</P>
<P>
   The institute noted that Crumb ``has spent her life dedicated to
hospice care and resolving health care issues for those in need.''
</P>
<P>
   Crumb, a registered nurse who lives in Port Angeles, Wash.,
created the Hospice of Clallam County, a volunteer community
hospital, after overcoming resistance from the health care industry
to ``free health care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Through sheer dedication, force of personality and the support
of client families, she has managed to make believers out of every
skeptic...(and) provides a loving and supportive environment for
patients while saving the government hundreds of thousands of
dollars in health care expenses,'' the institute declared.
</P>
<P>
   Award recipients are selected by a board composed of leaders in
education, business and the public sector. Over the 26-year history
of the institute, 100 Americans have received national awards and
more than 7,000 have received ``grassroots'' awards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson Award certificate includes a quotation from Thomas
Jefferson: ``One man with courage is the majority.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five Onassis award winners and the 37 other
Jefferson Award winners, the institute also presented four national
awards. The winners were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin ``for providing the political
leadership and entrepreneurial spirit which has led to one of the
strongest economies in U.S. history.''
</P>
<P>
   _ TV personality Oprah Winfrey ``for her philanthropic spirit
and her commitment to promoting decency in daytime television
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Thaddeus S. Lott Sr., of Houston, ``for being a pioneer in
education reform, creating an innovative charter school district,
the first-of-its kind in the country, in inner-city Houston.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bobby Jindal for ``his vibrant leadership on behalf of all
generations _ young and old _ in the national struggle to
strengthen and preserve Medicare in time for the retirement of the
`Baby Boomers.''' He is executive director of the National
Bi-Partisan Commission on the Future of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The other four Onassis winners were:
</P>
<P>
   _ James ``Major'' Adams, of Chicago, for his work with youth
groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Crystal Davis, of St. Louis, for creating the Community Hope
Center that provides community assistance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pam Marota, of San Francisco, for developing the ``Kimo
Bear,'' a teddy bear used to teach children about cancer and its
effects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Carlos Spaht II, of Shreveport, La., for developing a program
that to encourage young people to stay in school.

WHEN TROPICAL FRUIT AND PEPPERS GET TOGETHER, THE HEAT IS ON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fruit is the hottest thing on today's salsa market.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches, plums, watermelon, cantaloupe, papaya, pineapple, mango
and nectarines are cozying up to chiles to create a mixed marriage
made in heaven.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't your grandpa's salsa, that chunky, jalapeno blend
that's red from the tomatoes and hot from the chiles. Now, the
haute thing is hot things in many tropical hues.
</P>
<P>
   ``First came the regular stuff we all grew up with: tomatoes,
garlic and peppers,'' says W. Park Kerr, founder of El Paso Chile
Co., one of the premier boutique salsa makers. ``Then all the
salsas started getting hotter than hell. Now things have started
moving back to the center. People want heat, but they also want
flavor. And because chiles are fruit, they play well together.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, El Paso Chile Co. introduced Mango Tango (a
combination of mango, papaya and pineapples). That pretty much sat
on shelves in its high-end outlets, including Williams Sonoma.
Today, the company's Mango Peach Salsa is its third-highest seller.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the fancy food folks producing these salsas. Tom
Thumb's house brand, the President's Choice line, is bottling Tangy
Salsa with Pineapple. Mrs. Renfro's, a Fort Worth producer of
chow-chow and relishes, is selling Mrs. Renfro's Peach Salsa
through 7-Eleven stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Hudgins, the former editor of ``Chile Pepper'' magazine,
thinks the new twist began in Florida. There, creative chefs were
putting their own spin on New American cuisine, and tropical fruits
added a native touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the salsas that come across my desk are being
produced in southern states, the fruit-growing states,'' Hudgins
says.
</P>
<P>
   One of Hudgins' favorite combinations is mango with habanero
chiles. The peppers she likes in fruit salsa are a little more
tropical, as well. Two favorites are datils, grown mostly in
Florida, and manzana, a yellow apple-flavored chile from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr agrees. ``Habanero is really a tropical chile. Papaya,
habanero and mango hold hands very well. One of my secrets, too, is
to combine peppers. I'll use a green chile for round flavor, plus
serrano for assertive sex appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all combinations work, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a srawberry salsa once. It confused me.''
</P>
<P>
   SUMMER NECTARINE, TOMATO AND RED ONION SALSA
</P>
<P>
   Yields 2 cups
</P>
<P>
   1 large ripe red tomato, diced

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time keeps on slipping into the future, as the Steve Miller
Band's rock song has it. Wristwatches are doing their best to keep
up.
</P>
<P>
   These days, watch design is as much about technology as it is
about horology. Sports watches with lap timers are enhanced with
altimeters and pulse monitors. Built-in pagers provide instant
accessibility, and data-storage devices for the wrist may soon make
the Filofax obsolete. In the near future, high-tech wristwear may
even notify you of your exact position on the planet or, if you're
diabetic, keep tabs on your glucose level.
</P>
<P>
   The way people keep track of time changed in 1970 when a
prototype of the first digital watch wowed the world with its
bright red display and space-age design. Named after newly
discovered stars that emit radio waves at regular intervals, the
Pulsar from HMW hit stores in 1972 at a price of $2,100.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, companies like Texas Instruments, Fairchild
and National Semiconductor began mass-producing quartz digital
watches, while research at RCA and Kent State University led to the
development of the first digital watches with liquid crystal
displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, a very quiet replacement of all the guts of
watches was taking place,'' said Carlene Stevens, curator in the
history of technology division at the National Museum of American
History in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same sort of thing that happened later with radios
and telephones and just about every other consumer product,'' Ms.
Stevens said. ``The watches are very early markers in that consumer
electronics revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution, has a
Web site on the history of quartz watches
(www.si.edu/lemelson/Quartz/index.html).
</P>
<P>
   Digital watches _ like the first calculator watch, which was
priced at $4,000 with a gold case and a plastic toothpicklike tool
for pushing the tiny keys _ were clearly marketed to the
conspicuous consumer. But even with Texas Instruments' 1976
announcement of a $20 digital watch, the market was quickly
cornered by foreign lands using inexpensive labor, like Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chip makers failed because they found out it wasn't a chip
business _ it was a jewelry business,'' said Louis Galie, vice
president of research and development at Timex Corp.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the digital watch industry has changed into
a telecommunications business, a computer business and a
high-tech-sensor business. Function and form battle in the
laboratories for real estate on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group of products that fit well on your wrist,''
Galie said. ``It's not necessarily the best place to put them; it
sure isn't the easiest place to put them if you're an engineer, but
this category of products works best if they're always with you.''
</P>
<P>
   A pager is one example. Pager-watch combinations are nothing
new. In 1991, Swatch came up with the Beep, the first watch-pager
combination, and Seiko followed with its numeric Message Watch.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced watch-pager arrived late last year, when
Motorola's Paging Products Group (which introduced a pager-watch
that failed several years ago) and Timex put their heads, and
wallets, together to come up with Beepwear.
</P>
<P>
   Bulky but effective, the $129 Beepwear is the first pager-watch
to use Motorola's Flex paging protocol, which enables text and
number messages to be received in thousands of cities and towns
across the country. In fact, Swatch in March announced a strategic
alliance with Motorola to incorporate Flex technology into its
paging products as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pagers are still the least expensive way to communicate,''
said Victoria Durkin, director of marketing for MTX Paging
Products, the joint venture of Swatch and Motorola. ``Besides, you
can't keep a cell phone on all the time. The batteries just don't
last.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the rub with Swatch Talk, a cordless telephone on a watch
first demonstrated in March that works only within 300 yards or so
of its land-line-connected base.
</P>
<P>
   While the battery in the demo unit is said to provide less than
an hour of talking time, Swatch says that the amount of talking
time will be significantly increased before the watch goes to
market next year.
</P>
<P>
   Swatch's chief executive, Nicholas Hayek, said the solution to
the battery problem was to create the power right on your wrist.
The recently announced Swatch Autoquartz technology converts
natural wrist motion into stored power with a tiny mechanical
generator.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what we're developing now, you can practically talk
indefinitely as long as you're moving, walking around a city for
instance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, watches outfitted with cellular phones are not much
good if you cannot remember the number of the person you need to
call. So watches that double as little black books hit the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't always have your personal digital assistant with
you,'' Galie said. ``But for the last 75 years, people have always
been wearing their watches. And I don't think that's going to
change anytime soon.''

</P>
<P>
   It was the geek-chic calculator watch that led in the mid-1990s
to the introduction of Timex's Data Link and Casio's Databank
watches, which hold phone numbers, appointment reminders and memos.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the need for a keyboard, the Data Link receives
information like telephone numbers and schedules from a desktop
computer when, using software developed by Microsoft, a user holds
the timepiece in front of the computer monitor. The Data Link comes
with a floppy disk for PCs; it is not available for the Macintosh.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny receptor on the watch face converts flickers on the
monitor into digital information. Appropriately enough, the next
Beepwear model will have Data Link technology integrated into it.
</P>
<P>
   Seiko hopes to bring more of a PC's power directly into the
wristwatch itself. The Ruputer, released in Japan last week by
Seiko Instruments, is compatible with Windows 95. Data can be fed
into the watch by using a built-in miniature joystick to select
characters of the alphabet or through infrared or wire connections
to a desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of the increasing intelligence of watches with
on-board computer chips is Swatch Access, released in 1995. With
the same size and appearance of a traditional analog Swatch watch _
light plastic with stylized graphics _ Swatch Access has a tiny
computer chip and a loop antenna that enable the contents in its
memory to be read by an external scanner.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 3 million Access watches sold so far have
been bought by skiers and snowboarders at California's Snow Valley
Ski Area and 300 other resorts around the world. Rather than
receiving paper lift tickets, holders of season tickets or day
passes simply pass the watch under a scanner at the ski lift and
hit the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   In the ski-resort city of Salzburg, Austria, the Access is used
as an electronic cash card; visitors buy credits that are loaded
into the watch and then debited at pay points in restaurants and
museums, and on public transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ladies that have seen it said: `We don't have to have a
bag full of cards and checkbooks and money any more. We'll have it
on our wrist,''' Hayek said.
</P>
<P>
   But while high-tech watches keep pace with the digital
technology that gave birth to them, the inevitable stress that
accompanies their precision remains the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common perception about time today is that we simply
don't have enough of it,'' said Ms. Stevens, of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an illusion that by scheduling yourself tightly and
chopping time up into smaller and smaller fragments, you're
expanding your day,'' she said. ``But no matter what your watch
does, it's not going to give you more time.''

`THE ODD SEA': FIRST NOVEL MAKES MAGIC OF CALAMITY
</HEADLINE>
  (Publication notes at end)  
 (ja)  
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a haunting first novel that takes a horrifying family
calamity and turns it into a form of magic.
</P>
<P>
   You don't know what to think in the opening pages of ``The Odd
Sea,'' by Frederick Reiken, when 16-year-old Ethan Shumway leaves
his rural western Massachusetts home and suddenly disappears. As
his younger brother, Philip, the story's narrator, describes it:
``Ethan had walked down the driveway, the May sun glinting off the
back of his yellow T-shirt. Then he was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the police begin to investigate, you're not certain how
seriously to take this disappearance. Ethan, an outstanding athlete
and guitar player, has spoken of traveling to distant places, so it
may be that he has simply gone off on an adventure. His parents,
described by the narrator with charming humor, seem oddly passive
in their initial response, allowing the remaining four children,
Philip and his three sisters, Amy, Halley and Dana, to continue
their usual outdoor rounds as if there were no real threat there.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Lawrence, even tells his children a story about what
Philip describes as ``a royal family of beavers, and a noble beaver
king who went off to sack the city of Beaverilium, then spent a
decade finding his way back home.'' Philip continues: ``Beavers
sailed ships and fought with weapons and were both helped and
hindered by the crafty beaver-gods of Olympia. I think he managed
to cover everything: absence, distance, longing, hope, return.''
</P>
<P>
   When Halley, the middle daughter, eventually points out the
story's resemblance to Homer's ``Odyssey,'' which she has started
reading in English class, Dana, the youngest, yells out, ``It's
not!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not what?'' Amy, the oldest, asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the Odd Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Odyssey.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet soon enough the horror of what may have happened to Ethan
begins to sink in, and each family member reacts in his or her own
peculiar way. Lawrence, a house carpenter by trade, dedicates
himself to learning ``the lost art of timber framing,'' or putting
together houses without using power tools or nails. His wife,
Marilyn, can't sleep, and begins to spend her nights baking,
reading classic novels and standing out ``with the stars,'' which,
she says, on clear nights ``could draw the sadness from her
heart.'' Eventually she grows so depressed she has to be
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Dana works on honing her basketball skills, shooting dozens of
foul shots in the driveway after dark. Philip obsessively searches
the surrounding woods, on the theory that by ``not-finding'' Ethan,
the odds of his survival will be increased, even though Halley, who
is closest to Philip in age, says, ``No offense, but that's
retarded.'' Amy drives to Troy, N.Y., and sorts fruitlessly through
the items left by a serial killer who has been arrested and whose
house and grounds have been found to contain the remains of a dozen
or so tortured children, ages 7 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   So the possibility of disaster grows in the reader's mind, and
with it a sense of the story's looming pain.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who lives in western Massachusetts and is a reporter
and nature writer for The Daily Hampshire Gazette, has skillfully
balanced this pain against the hopefulness of the narrator.
Strongly identifying with his lost brother yet milder mannered and
less talented, Philip eventually picks up a trail that Ethan left
in the weeks and months before his disappearance.
</P>
<P>
   This trail leads him to Ethan's girlfriend, Melissa Moody, the
daughter of a neighboring farmer and a serious painter; to a diary
in which Ethan recorded everything from his thoughts on art to his
sexual activities, and to Victoria Rhone, the director of a local
arts colony who turns out to have been obsessed with Ethan and
played the role of a somewhat ambiguous mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The trail also leads Philip into the surrounding natural world,
which Reiken knits adeptly into his story. ``There is a boundary
where the city light of Pittsfield ends,'' he writes, ``where
suddenly night is deep and dark and stars twinkle beckoning you to
rise, which you do. You start to float out there, beyond things,
without light to obscure the dusty river of the Milky Way. As if
slipping through a doorway, the passage into these hills creates a
sense of being far-flung, lost in some old and still untamed place,
where you could easily disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this the place where Ethan may have gone, Philip wonders,
mixing his romantic temperament with his knowledge of contemporary
physics. Has his brother stepped through some mysterious doorway
into the world of antimatter? Whatever the answer, he uses the
wound of his loss to make of himself the artist who will write
``The Odd Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two years after Ethan's disappearance, one of the
sneakers he was wearing that morning is found in the ivy near the
end of the driveway. And a year or so later the Pittsfield police
arrest a local man for trying to abduct a teen-age girl.
Questioned, the man admits to killing two teen-age boys and burying
them behind his mother's house in the town of Blue Mountain Lake.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say that these developments solve the mystery of Ethan's
disappearance. But they bring you back with a vengeance to more
practical considerations. And the mixture of the grisly and
metaphysical that Reiken works so effectively keeps you spellbound
by ``The Odd Sea'' until its very last page.

     AOL ASKS CONGRESS FOR RESTRICTIONS ON JUNK
E-MAIL
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;     By KIMBERLY MARSELAS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An America Online representative urged lawmakers
Wednesday to join its ``war against spam,'' unsolicited bulk e-mail
that has plagued Internet service providers and cost individual
recipients time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Senators and Internet insiders said ``spam'' is worse than
regular junk mail because the addressees and service providers like
AOL, known as ISPs, must pay related costs, while the sender
advertises for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any legislation proposed should give ISPs the ability to
recover the cost of sending this junk e-mail,'' Randall Boe,
associate general counsel for AOL, told the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on communications.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee is considering anti-spam legislation that would
require direct e-mail marketers to provide accurate return
addresses and honor requests to remove private e-mail addresses
from mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a question of taking a cloak of secrecy off the
senders,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., the bill's
co-sponsor. The senator said fewer incidents of ``spamming'' would
occur if senders knew they would get replies from angry recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Mulligan of the Center for Democracy and Technology
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was enacted, it would lead to a reduction in junk
e-mail,'' she said.~~~ ``But it's unclear whether it will be the
silver bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee heard Wednesday from witnesses with a variety
of concerns about the unwanted e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junk e-mail has the potential to harm our economy in ways
terrorists only dream of,'' said Ray Everett-Church, co-founder of
an ``anti-spam'' coalition. He said ``spam'' has the ability to
crash computer systems of major ISPs. Systems run by AT&AMP;T, Netcom,
Pacific Bell and GTE have already had crashes attributed to
``spam.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``spam'' is rumored to come from a sketch by the
English comedy group Monty Python, in which restaurant patrons are
offered an abundance of Spam, a processed meat product, according
to attorney David Kramer of Palo Alto, Calif., who specializes in
Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said that the proposed requirement that bulk-mail senders
identify themselves could be ``easily circumvented'' by senders who
set up temporary accounts, send hundreds of junk e-mails and then
close the account before they can be traced.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses accused the senders of making false claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spam has become the fraud artist's calling card on the
Internet,'' said Sheila Anthony, a federal trade commissioner.
Anthony said ``spam'' has been used to promote everything from
pyramid schemes to chain letters.
</P>
<P>
   Spam has also been used to advertise pornographic web sites to
children, said Boe. AOL and other providers have optional parental
safeguards limiting children's access to those sites, but junk
e-mailers ``make a mockery of that process,'' Boe said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett-Church said the problems caused by junk e-mail warrant
its prohibition and said the Senate bill would be inadequate to
stop it. A bill offered in the House last spring by Rep. Chris
Smith, R-N.J., would have made any junk e-mail transmissions
illegal. The bill is pending in the House subcommittee on
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   But the senators at Wednesday's subcommittee hearing said
``spamming'' shouldn't be outlawed because companies deserve a
chance to get their message out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, constitutionally, we probably have to give them
that,'' said Torricelli.

<P>
   ``Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me'' are the
opening words to a famous song. But what do the words really mean?
How can being filled with peace inside one's self lead to peace on
earth?
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant philosopher Teilhard de Chardin refers to the
``unimpeachable wholeness of the universe.'' What does this mean to
us?
</P>
<P>
   It means we are part of the universe; we are part of the
wholeness of creation. We do not walk our path of life alone. The
whole universe walks with us, and we, as a human race, are coming
to a greater realization that we are all ``one'' in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe each of us is like a pixel. Just as a hologram is made up
of numerous pixels -- each one containing all of the information
that can be found in the total image -- so each person may be a
tiny particle of life, containing all the data that is present in
the sum total of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Gautama Buddha, whose original name was Prince Siddhartha,
grappled with the problems of human existence. Though his words had
not been written down, his disciples memorized many of his
teachings and passed them on to succeeding generations by word of
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In the principal teachings of the Buddha called the ``Four Noble
Truths,'' it is stated first that human life is intrinsically
unhappy; second, that the cause of this unhappiness is human
selfishness and desire; third, that individual selfishness and
desire can be brought to an end; and fourth, that the method of
escape from selfishness involves what is called the ``Eightfold
Path.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``Eightfold Path'' involves right views, right thought,
right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right
mindfulness and right meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this awareness of ``rightness'' and the letting go of
personal negativities can do a tremendous amount to create a
loving, caring and more beautiful world. A good way to create a
better world is for each of us to be better individuals.
</P>
<P>
   There are certain laws of life that, when followed, can make
life sweeter, more harmonious, prosperous, healthy and free. When
we choose to abide by these laws, we reap the benefits of living in
harmony with the universe. When we don't, we risk experiencing
sickness, war, economic insecurity and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The problems that create turmoil, pain, misery and suffering in
our world can change when each person makes a conscious decision to
act and think for the good of all.
</P>
<P>
   Personal motive is always a good guide. Ask yourself, ``Why am I
doing the things I do?'' and allow the inherent wisdom of spirit to
provide the true answer. If your motives are pure, then good should
come of them.
</P>
<P>
   The positive ideas we believe in today can constantly expand and
grow in our consciousness. This could be termed being ``on beam''
with life. Pilots often fly using a radio beam as a guide. As long
as they remain ``on beam,'' they are safe. If they get off the
beam, they're in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Each human person, too, has an inborn ``beam'' -- a conscience.
While we are in tune with the way things were designed to be, we
are ``safe.'' When we are out of tune, we may show it in the form
of greed, fear, sickness, addiction and jealousy.
</P>
<P>
   Some people experience a lifetime of having the flu each winter,
allergies in the fall, headaches, indigestion and all the so-called
minor ailments that we accept as a part of life.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it isn't necessary for this to be so. Each of us has
the inner power to encourage health, happiness and serenity. We are
capable of re-educating our bodies and our thinking.
</P>
<P>
   By thinking and acting always with good in our hearts; by
becoming responsible for ourselves, and, as an old Irish saying has
it, ``If you see a job that needs doing, that means it's yours to
do,'' we can begin to change our wrong world into a right world.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to stop saying that ``they'' need to be changing
things around here. When we start saying, ``I need to be giving
life a helping hand,'' we then begin to benefit life.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that ``a journey of a thousand miles begins
with the first step.'' Let each one of us take that step and make
it count.

VIRTUAL-CLASSES TREND IS ALARMING PROFESSORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (bl)  
 By TINA KELLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 800 professors at the University of Washington have
signed an open letter to Gov. Gary Locke to say they are worried
about the enthusiasm he and one of his advisers are showing for
instruction via CD-ROMs and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers worry that Washington State will be too quick to
embrace the idea of the virtual, online university to cut costs and
jobs. They say they see some disturbing national trends in that
direction, citing the results of a roundtable of university
professors and presidents brought together by the consulting arm of
the Coopers &AMP; Lybrand financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   A white paper issued after the conference in July said that
``instructional software could easily substitute for campus-based
instruction or at least be a substantial part of the delivery
system'' and that the creation of only 25 online courses could
serve about 80 percent of the undergraduate enrollment in core
courses.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty members' letter, which they plan to deliver next
week, urges Locke to ``support learning as a human and social
practice, an enrichment of soul and mind, the entitlement of all
citizens in a democracy, and not a profit-making commodity to be
offered on the cheapest terms to the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   College professors are facing great upheaval as policymakers
talk about using the Internet to modernize academia. With the
arrival of the World Wide Web, video streaming, multimedia CD-ROMs
and computer-assisted research, students now have easy access to
more facts than scholars a few decades ago ever imagined, and those
changes have made some administrators and taxpayers view a
classroom lecture as an inefficient mode of imparting knowledge
from one brain to many.
</P>
<P>
   A speech by Wallace Loh, the governor's policy director, to the
University of Washington Law School in May worried many professors.
In that speech, Loh said telecommunications would be especially
useful for teaching adults returning to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is likely to be the much more common method of
delivering the learning they need, at home or in the workplace for
them, simply because they're place-bound,'' he said in an
interview. Younger students would be more likely to attend
traditional colleges or universities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The professors do not oppose all Internet instruction. ``Under
certain circumstances, distance learning is a wonderful option for
people who are incapable of getting to a campus,'' said Lauren
Goodlad, an assistant English professor who signed the letter.
``The faculty is just concerned that this would be economically
foolhardy because in point of fact, high-quality teaching, whether
done on a distance-learning basis or on a campus basis, requires
contact.
</P>
<P>
   Many professors did not like what Loh called the ``brave new
world of digital education.'' But others believe that high
technology could free up time for instructors to advise or tutor
students and pursue more research.
</P>
<P>
   Already schools can circulate lectures and video clips of top
professors electronically, and professors can get short-answer
tests graded by computers. One of the main proponents of the letter
acknowledges that technology has helped streamline academic life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to use it and are all using it, but when they
basically want to replace people with computers, that's where we
draw the line,'' said Galya Diment, an associate professor in the
department of Slavic languages and literatures and president of the
University of Washington chapter of the American Association of
University Professors, which helped circulate the letter.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that 95 percent of the signatures on the letter had
been gathered via e-mail. ``We don't want to go back to the caves
or even to typewriters,'' she said. ``What we objected to were the
extreme views, like beaming an image of professors to students and
thinking that would be a satisfactory way of replacing face to face
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Borning, a professor of computer science and engineering,
joined at least 10 other teachers in his department in signing the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of education happens through the interaction of faculty
and students in a variety of departments,'' he said. He described
studies in computer graphics at the university that successfully
bring together art, music and computer scholars. ``If you have
people learning from CD-ROMs off in their garage, this sort of
thing is not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Locke, a Democrat, created the 2020
Commission and told it ``to re-think and re-invent higher education
from the ground up.'' Some at the University of Washington have
criticized the selection of commission members _ whom Locke called
``a group of this state's smartest people''_ because the panel
includes many from the business community, but no professors from
any college or university. The commission's recommendations to the
governor are due in September.

     AOL ASKS CONGRESS FOR RESTRICTIONS ON JUNK
E-MAIL
 &HT;     Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;     By KIMBERLY MARSELAS 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An America Online representative urged lawmakers
Wednesday to join its ``war against spam,'' unsolicited bulk e-mail
that has plagued Internet service providers and cost individual
recipients time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Senators and Internet insiders said ``spam'' is worse than
regular junk mail because the addressees and service providers like
AOL, known as ISPs, must pay related costs, while the sender
advertises for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any legislation proposed should give ISPs the ability to
recover the cost of sending this junk e-mail,'' Randall Boe,
associate general counsel for AOL, told the Senate Commerce
subcommittee on communications.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee is considering anti-spam legislation that would
require direct e-mail marketers to provide accurate return
addresses and honor requests to remove private e-mail addresses
from mailing lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a question of taking a cloak of secrecy off the
senders,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., the bill's
co-sponsor. The senator said fewer incidents of ``spamming'' would
occur if senders knew they would get replies from angry recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre Mulligan of the Center for Democracy and Technology
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was enacted, it would lead to a reduction in junk
e-mail,'' she said.~~~ ``But it's unclear whether it will be the
silver bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee heard Wednesday from witnesses with a variety
of concerns about the unwanted e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junk e-mail has the potential to harm our economy in ways
terrorists only dream of,'' said Ray Everett-Church, co-founder of
an ``anti-spam'' coalition. He said ``spam'' has the ability to
crash computer systems of major ISPs. Systems run by AT&AMP;T, Netcom,
Pacific Bell and GTE have already had crashes attributed to
``spam.''
</P>
<P>
   The term ``spam'' is rumored to come from a sketch by the
English comedy group Monty Python, in which restaurant patrons are
offered an abundance of Spam, a processed meat product, according
to attorney David Kramer of Palo Alto, Calif., who specializes in
Internet issues.
</P>
<P>
   Kramer said that the proposed requirement that bulk-mail senders
identify themselves could be ``easily circumvented'' by senders who
set up temporary accounts, send hundreds of junk e-mails and then
close the account before they can be traced.
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses accused the senders of making false claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spam has become the fraud artist's calling card on the
Internet,'' said Sheila Anthony, a federal trade commissioner.
Anthony said ``spam'' has been used to promote everything from
pyramid schemes to chain letters.
</P>
<P>
   Spam has also been used to advertise pornographic web sites to
children, said Boe. AOL and other providers have optional parental
safeguards limiting children's access to those sites, but junk
e-mailers ``make a mockery of that process,'' Boe said.
</P>
<P>
   Everett-Church said the problems caused by junk e-mail warrant
its prohibition and said the Senate bill would be inadequate to
stop it. A bill offered in the House last spring by Rep. Chris
Smith, R-N.J., would have made any junk e-mail transmissions
illegal. The bill is pending in the House subcommittee on
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   But the senators at Wednesday's subcommittee hearing said
``spamming'' shouldn't be outlawed because companies deserve a
chance to get their message out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, constitutionally, we probably have to give them
that,'' said Torricelli.

   HARDY SWEET PEAS
</P>
<P>
   Q. I love old-fashioned sweet peas and plant them every year,
but they never seem to do well in my garden. I've heard there is
also a perennial type. Is it easier to grow? If so, would it be
hardy on Long Island?
</P>
<P>
   A. Lathyrus odoratus, the old-fashioned annual sweet pea, would
rather be in England. It needs slightly alkaline soil, plenty of
rain and a long season of cool weather to thrive. And no matter
where they are growing, flowers must be picked constantly. Plants
will stop blooming if they are permitted to form seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Lathyrus latifolius (the most common perennial sweet pea) are an
entirely different story. Unlike their annual cousins, they don't
mind warm weather; flowering usually starts when July does. They
will slack off if the heat gets really brutal, but as long as it
cools off at night they'll keep blooming for months.
</P>
<P>
   These perennial sweet peas are much more drought-tolerant than
the annuals, and far more resistant to pests and diseases. A single
mature plant can cover an area two- or three-feet wide and eight-
or nine-feet tall. They're hardy, too, even in New England.
</P>
<P>
   You may have any color you want _ as long as it's pink or white.
And you will not have perfume. Old-fashioned varieties of odoratus
live up to their name; latifolius is scentless in comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial sweet peas aren't popular in the nursery trade,
possibly because they grow deep roots and long vines before
flowering. But they grow easily from seed, and it only takes two or
three years for them to start blooming. Seeds are available from
Park Seed, 1 Parkton Ave., Greenwood, S.C. 29647-0001; (800)
845-3369, and Thompson &AMP; Morgan, P.O. Box 1308, Jackson, N.J.
08527-0308; (800) 274-7333. Both offer free catalogs.

</P>
<P>
   Q. Every year, I have to replant my flowers at least three times
because the rabbits eat them. They have also devoured my roses,
barberries and perennials. I have tried moth balls, dried blood,
repellants and even fences. They just hop over the fence and have a
buffet. I have seen them standing on their hind legs to reach up
into my bushes. Help!
</P>
<P>
   A. Remain calm, all you have to do is amend your fences. Rabbits
excel at the long jump, not the high hurdles. They can't climb, and
their hearts aren't really in it, when it comes to digging. They
can, however, squeeze through tiny gaps, and they love to do the
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Help is available at the lumberyard: farmers' rabbit fencing, a
wire grid, three-feet tall, has very close mesh for the bottom
foot. Bury it a couple of inches deep or otherwise secure it to the
ground, so they can't slither underneath. If you are also
conscientious in the matter of tight gates, the fenced area will be
rabbit-free.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the unfenced areas will remain vulnerable until
you get a dog.
</P>
<P>
   READING YELLOW LEAVES
</P>
<P>
   Q. The leaves on some of my tomato and bell pepper plants are
starting to turn yellow. The plants get plenty of sun and water
each day. What am I doing wrong? Is there something I can add to
the soil to help the plants along?
</P>
<P>
   A. Chlorosis, a shortage of chlorophyll that results in
yellowing leaves, is the plant announcing, ``I don't feel well,''
and could be caused by just about anything, including a whole
panoply of diseases. But if it is happening slowly, and there are
no other symptoms (curling, spots, brown edges, wholesale
leaf-drop), it's likely that your plants are either waterlogged or
hungry.
</P>
<P>
   If your soil is heavy clay, frequent watering could be drowning
the roots. If it's sandy, chances are that constant watering is
leaching nutrients from the soil. So the first thing you can do is
cut back on the water a bit; it's OK for the surface soil to dry
out, and the root zone should be moist, not wet.
</P>
<P>
   Then, give your plants a drink of soluble, all-purpose plant
fertilizer, either a widely-available chemical mix like Peters or
Miracle Grow or, even better, a fish and seaweed based organic mix
like Neptune's Harvest, available from Pinetree Garden Seeds, Box
300, New Gloucester, Maine 04260; (207) 926-3400, or Worm's Way,
7850 North Highway 37, Bloomington, Ind. 47404; (800) 274-9676.
Catalogs are free.

   A 19th-CENTURY VILLAGE RESTORED WITH LOVE AND LUCK  
 (bl)  
 By WILLIAM L. HAMILTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALMVILLE, N.Y. _ Heidi Benson's house is also her hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century carriage house near Newburgh, where Ms. Benson,
a senior editor at Family Life magazine, lives with her husband,
Matthew Benson, a photographer, is part of a one-acre village of
carpenter Gothic outbuildings. They were built as a gentleman's
farm for an Italianate Hudson River mansion next door. In addition
to the carriage house, there is a farm manager's house, a barn, a
milking parlor, a stable and an icehouse, with a village green
between.
</P>
<P>
   For four years, the Bensons have been renovating _ and
reinventing _ with an imaginative approach toward restoration that
only amateurs would attempt. Inspired by their materials,
ingenuity, not precedent, has been their historical guide.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benson grew up in the farm manager's house. A librarian
lived in the carriage house, at other end of the green where Ms.
Benson played as a child. The complex was obscured by the mysteries
of neglect: squalls of lilac and a yew tree that grew undisturbed,
like the beard on a giant, that no one in the village was brave
enough to trim. No longer parts of a working farm, many of the
buildings were abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the librarian moved. She sold her house to Ms. Benson,
who was again living with her parents after her brother's death in
a climbing accident. Two years later, Ms. Benson's mother died of
cancer. In 1997, when her father remarried and moved, she bought
the family house.
</P>
<P>
   With the farm property reunited, Ms. Benson became mistress of
the village she grew up in.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have this sense of place became a comfort,'' Ms. Benson
said. ``For my father, it was too emotional to stay on. For me, it
was too emotional to let go.''
</P>
<P>
   She met her husband, Matthew in 1994, shortly before buying the
librarian's house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He answered the ad,'' Ms. Benson said, ``for gentleman
gardener.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married in October 1997. Renovation has been a kind of
courtship. They did the work themselves, with the help of Benson's
brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   With six buildings and a green, the Bensons realized that what
was called for was town planning, not single acts of restoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the village configuration, we wanted to get the
village in place first, which meant fencing and trees,'' Benson
said. ``You want to plant your landscape right away, because it
takes several years to develop and mature. Then you can move on to
the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The great surprise of the project is that the Bensons have never
done this before _ not even the gardening. There is good reason to
take heart. For two beginners, success has been a series of firsts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had gardened intellectually,'' Benson said. ``I read garden
books, catalogs. I loved plants and taxonomy and horticulture. I
had never gardened with my hands.'` In gardening, the couple
learned quickly to move on quickly from mistakes. ``It's trial and
error,'' Benson explained. ``Some things you plant, and you
realize, it looks nothing like it was described.''
</P>
<P>
   Gardening, in turn, taught them to adopt flexibly to renovation,
when they began to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you discover is that if you have basic skills, it's all
about application and learning,'' Benson said. ``There are no
secrets out there. Also, being willing to fail, and try again. Some
things aren't going to work the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bensons cleared the green, cutting down younger trees,
pruning the yew back to an ornamental shape and thinning and
relocating the ilacs. They fenced in the enclave, added gates and
laid new flower beds inside the fence, which enclosed the yard,
left it open but made it private, and strengthened the community
between the buildings. They trellised the milking parlor and
trained climbing roses to it. They planted a pair of crabapple
trees and put a bench between them. And they created a kitchen
garden within the stone foundation of a barn that had fallen and
been disassembled in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who had apprenticed as a teen-ager to a carpenter, built
the fences and bent the wood for the gate, soaking it in the
cistern on the site. They had a fence-painting party. It took 15
people three hours to paint the fencing they had put up.
</P>
<P>
   The small scale and various pieces of the property encouraged
the idea that anything could be accomplished, with personal
leverage, more than one old big house and a garden might have. When
they turned their attention to the buildings, what the Bensons
discovered they had was a kit for a village _ six ``boxed sets'' of
19th-century windows, shutters, doors, posts, finials, ironwork,
hardware and stonework that could be creatively exchanged as they
renovated.
</P>
<P>
   And the 10 acres of woods on two sides of the farm revealed
themselves to be a salvage yard of sorts: generations of local
landowners had used the undeveloped land as a dump for antiquated
farm equipment and abandoned architectural elements.
</P>
<P>
   The kit-like nature of the Bensons' village has produced a
personal style of restoration. Though each project undertaken is
squarely within the spirit of the 19th-century gentleman's farm,
nothing is historically strict. The hoop of a carriage wheel, cut
in half, became the arbor for a climbing rose, above a garden gate.
A horseshoe became a latch.
</P>
<P>
   In the stable, which Benson has begun to rebuild as a
photography studio, the ironwork that divided the horses' stalls
became decorative balustrades for a new loft above. The stalls'
finials and posts now grace the curved-wood garden gate at the
entrance to the green. Nothing wasted; nothing wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's recycling as an art form,'' Ms. Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Benson added: ``You're always mixing your imagination and your
sense of history You look at an object you find, and you think,
`What can I do with that?' The idea of finding a different use for
something is like giving it a renaissance, a whole new sense of
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bensons put their enlightened attitude toward restoration to
work most dramatically in the garden they created within the
foundation of the barn. They converted the adjacent milking parlor
to a potting shed, adding a door and a window with a view of the
garden. They plotted the planting beds for vegetables, fruit and
herbs with old barn beams. They laid paths with bricks from an old
patio that the librarian had built behind the carriage house.
</P>
<P>
   Serendipitously, they found the original cupola from the missing
barn, living like a hermit in the woods. They moved it back to the
site of the barn and installed it at the center of the new garden.
Benson replaced its roof with open lathing, reinventing it as rose
bower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's come to rest where it was, only about 40 feet lower,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bensons also discovered a huge flat stone buried in another
part of the woods, which had been a brownstone stoop. They moved it
to the garden, to use as a low bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``We excavated it,'' Benson recalled, ``and lifted it like
Philistines working for Pharaoh, using a lever and fulcrum. Pried
it out of the ground, rolled it a hundred feet on an old dolly to
the steps into the garden, greased a heavy plank with gear oil,
slid the stone down onto logs and rolled it onto the platform it's
on now. It took seven hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Benson added, with the voice of experience, ``We don't move
anything unless it's a 1,000 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   For people who create their own problems, the problems normally
associated with renovation have been relative and small.
Contractors called in to reroof the buildings have provided most of
the excitement. Benson found precious pieces of his kit missing _
tongue-and-groove bedboard in the stable, carefully dismantled and
numbered for reassembly _ only to discover them in the roof above
his head, used as wood for common repair.
</P>
<P>
   The Bensons have also been inspired by their materials and the
ingenuities of another era that live with them in the village:
sliding pocket windows that disappear into walls, cisterns for
collecting rainwater and a stone fountainhead to humidify the
interior of a greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Because they have been creative with the pieces of their kit,
their budget has also been a beautiful thing. With little outlay on
new materials or labor, they estimate that they have spent roughly
$10,000 in four years, mostly for new roofs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you mean, `How many loads of sweaty T-shirts?''' Benson
said. ``There's much more to do,'' he added. ``We'll be employed
for life.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Benson, the work has brought something else home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother and I used to play in the woods, and collect
things, and built forts with them,'' she said as she picked fresh
lettuces for lunch, sounding a bit like a girl in a story who is
rewriting the ending. ``It's almost a repeat of childhood.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The Inflatable Moment,'' on view at the Urban
Center, 457 Madison Ave., celebrates a time when, if you didn't
have an idea, you just didn't show up. You'd be too embarrassed.
How different from today's climate of fear, when showing up with an
idea could get you fired.
</P>
<P>
   Inflatable architecture, the show's subject, was a terrible
idea, as it happens. As Lloyd Kahn, the architecture editor, wrote
in the Whole Earth Catalog, ``Inflatables are trippy, cheap, light,
imaginative spaces, not architecture at all. They're terrible to
work in. The blazing redundant surfaces disorient; one wallows in
space. When the sun goes behind a cloud you cease cooking and
immediately start freezing.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but so what? In those days, a terrible idea was better than
no idea. At times, a bad idea was even better than a good idea.
Architects at that moment were exploring the relationship between
metaphor and material reality. There's nothing like a bad idea for
showing up the difference between them.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Marc Dessauce, an architectural historian who lives
in New York, this big, sloppy, high-spirited show is the
Architectural League's tribute to 1968, the year the counterculture
was officially born amid campus upheavals and street
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Along with anniversary tributes like this show and a weekend
conference last month at the Columbia University Buell Center for
the Study of American Architecture, young designers today are also
offering a small reprise of the inflatable moment. Inflate, a
British design group, has displayed its blow-up bowls and vases at
downtown design stores. The dreadful 1967 Inflatable chair can be
purchased from a Web site. Even Ikea plans to introduce an Air Line
of inflatable footstools and sofas this October.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it's a perennial dream: to lose gravity, float away on
a cloud, rise above the world and the weight of grown-up
responsibilities. Nitrous oxide is the best way to inhabit that
dream, though the dentist's drill one must put up with to
experience such bliss can be very off-putting. And the impulse to
float away only partly explains the radical work of the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, society at large was exploring the meshing of
metaphor and materiality. In Paris, real cars were torched, real
trees cut down, real bodies carted off to the pokey. Garbage strewn
around the student-occupied Odeon theater gave off a genuine
stench. But as many who were students at the time recall, the May
events served primarily a metaphoric value. The counterculture was
a generalized protest against a diffuse idea of cultural authority.
Since architecture is traditionally an art of the Establishment, it
was not surprising that some of the counterculture's earliest
rumblings emanated from within architecture schools.
</P>
<P>
   The main part of the show focuses on the work of Utopie, a group
of French artists and writers who banded together in 1967 and
devoted much of their energy to designing inflatable structures and
promoting them in publications. The group included the architects
Jean Aubert, Jean-Paul Jungmann and Antoine Stinco and the writers
Jean Baudrillard, Isabelle Auricoste and Hubert Tonka. And the
heart of the show consists of their student work, including diploma
projects for the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.
</P>
<P>
   These presentation drawings depict a variety of pneumatic
building types, including housing, theaters, museums and other
public buildings. Some of these are air-supported structures in
which a pressurized interior supports a thin membrane. In others,
the enclosure is held aloft by air-filled structural ribs. Many of
them are transportable, and thus in theory do not require ownership
of land. Air, so they thought, was free.
</P>
<P>
   Dessauce writes that for members of Utopie, the inflatable
structure occupied a middle ground between conventional practice
and dropping out. The appeal of inflatables was precisely that they
were not architecture at all and therefore were untainted by
establishment associations. Lacking weight, they also lacked
gravitas. Like tents, they were events rather than buildings _
happenings, in the parlance of the time _ and thus made no claim on
endurance, much less on the eternity to which architecture often
aspires.
</P>
<P>
   Utopie's work, while squishy, is not as formless as you might
expect. Jean-Paul Jungmann's Dyodon pneumatic house, for example,
recalls the Buck Rogers designs of the elderly Frank Lloyd Wright,
like his unbuilt plan from the late 1950s for a convention center
on Ellis Island. (Wright's one venture into inflatables, a
windowless rubber igloo designed in 1957, is also included here.)
Most of the projects, though not rigidly structured, are formally
more complex than the geodesic domes of Buckminster Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   Fuller, who would routinely ask architects, ``What does your
building weigh?'', was clearly the inspiration for Aubert's 1966
Traveling Theater project, a soft dome of green fabric interlaced
with air-filled structural tubes. But the framework also has the
character of Gothic ribs. In fact, several projects in the show
evoke the fantastic Modernismo Gothicism of Gaudi, and would not
look out of place in the context of present-day Barcelona, with its
brilliant program of innovative public spaces.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at this material now, one thinks, why were these
people so dissatisfied? After all, they were living in Paris! City
of Light! A city where even student cafe food is heaven! What place
in this world or the next could be more Utopian than the Rive
Gauche?
</P>
<P>
   But the Utopie group was living in a time as well as a place. As
architecture students in the '60s, they were cruelly conscious of
the collapse of the utopia that had preceded them _ the modern
movement's dream of the rational, radiant city of towers in a park.
Students in the 1960s were living in the modern movement's future
time frame, but things within that frame had not turned out as
planned. All that propaganda, all that earnestness, and what was
there to show for it? The Tour Montparnasse, a big black shadow on
the Paris skyline. If students in the 1960s displayed an
unwillingness to grow up, who could blame them? Who wanted to grow
up and become a modern architect? Who wanted to be delusional?
</P>
<P>
   This lends considerable poignancy to the second part of the
show, a historical overview in which it can be seen that Utopie's
utopia fared even worse than the modern kind. Based on an
exhibition organized by Utopie in March 1968 at the Museum of
Modern Art in Paris, this show pulls together a hodgepodge of
pneumatic delights, including Quasar Khanh's inflatable lamps and
Andy Warhol's silver Mylar pillows. As a group, these projects have
all the charm of a deflated weather balloon.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, this stuff actually looked tatty even when
new. Khanh's lamp had a crooked hang. The iconic Blow chair by
Scolari, De Pas, D'Urbino, Lomazzi squeaked when you sat on it, a
sound effect as endearing as nails on a blackboard. The U.S.
Pavilion at the 1970 Osaka World's Fair looked terrific for five
minutes, before leakage problems caused the dome to sag. In fashion
photographs and shop windows, blow-up furnishings looked cool. At
home, they were last night's party favors.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inflatable buildings were too much like architecture
after all. By 1970, the Utopie group had disbanded. Before long,
the inflatable moment was ripe for satire. In 1972, the
Architectural League presented a project by Marc Balet, a young
Prix de Rome winner, at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
Visitors were invited to toss effervescent tablets into buckets of
water and envision the bubbles as architectural configurations. A
pair of bubbles might be a duplex. Rotated 90 degrees, it became a
ranch house.
</P>
<P>
   Balet later went on toward other forms of inflation, first as
art director of Warhol's Interview magazine, then as director of
the advertising agency Balet &AMP; Albert. But as this show clearly
documents, media hype was an integral part of 1968, and perhaps the
most enduring aspect of the counterculture as a whole. Or to put a
kinder spin on it, work like Utopie's aimed more to influence
consciousness than to rebuild the world.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, it is clear that the conceptual groundwork for
``the inflatable moment'' had actually been laid by the modern
movement. Marcel Breuer had predicted that ``in the end, we will
all sit on a resilient column of air.''
</P>
<P>
   Mies van der Rohe's esthetic ``of almost nothing'' emphasized
void spaces over solid walls. Utopie's reliance on advanced
technology extended Le Corbusier's concept of the house as a
machine for living in. That reliance was the major reason for
Utopie's breakup.
</P>
<P>
   How could utopia be built on the patents of the
military-industrial complex? Even assuming that land could be
borrowed and air pumped in free, what idealistic architect wanted
to stake a vision to the Joint Chiefs of Staff?
</P>
<P>
   And now we have airbags. Also, those little pillows you can buy
at the airport to tuck behind your lower back. The trick is to fill
them only half way, just until they gain a puddly consistency. The
best time I had in the last 10 years was spent floating on a Batman
raft in the blue water off Capri. And what I think about all the
time is shoving off from the shore, drifting down the river on
something light and lazy, while trees pass overhead and all else
waits.

Center of the Architectural League of New York, 457 Madison Ave.)

EUROPE'S NEW BANKNOTES: MORE THAN JUST MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KARRIE JACOBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   About a month ago, as preparations began for printing the 10
billion new Euro banknotes that will replace the familiar
currencies of most European nations by the end of 2001, a
French-made anti-counterfeiting hologram vanished.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance, which could prompt changes in the design of
some of the Euros, occurred on a flight from France to Germany,
where it was to be tested by a printer in Nuremberg. Officials
speculated that it had been stolen by well-informed thieves who
understood the significance of the device.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative theory _ entirely unofficial in nature _ is that
the hologram was snatched by an unhappy esthete who understands the
damage the Euro banknotes will do to the continent's reputation as
a place where the design of everyday things has a high priority.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Euro banknotes created by Robert Kaliena, a designer
for the Austrian Central Bank, were selected in a 1996 competition
in which entrants from all over the continent were asked to depict
the ``ages and styles of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaliena took those instructions to heart and fashioned a
veritable art history lesson with textbook examples of the
Romanesque, the Gothic, the Baroque and the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   The bridges and windows pictured are deliberately detached from
any particular place or building so images of structures that look
very familiar, but that you cannot quite place, are shown on
banknotes that are redolent of the Deutsche mark, the Dutch guilder
or the Swedish krona, but are less . . . well, specific. The Euro
notes depict Europe as you might see it on a
seven-countries-in-seven-days bus tour, a swirl of landmarks devoid
of culture or context.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the aim was to avoid glorifying any nationality or
insulting anyone through omission. Unfortunately, the banknotes, in
striving for the ecumenical look, make Europe seem like a very dull
place, more homogenous, even, than the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In an economic analysis of the Euro, attention is generally
focused on the Germans and the almighty mark or the Italians and
the shrinking lira, but from a graphic design standpoint, the most
significant event in the change-over is the loss of the Dutch
guilder. While the guilder is not among the world's powerhouse
currencies, the Netherlands Bank produces paper money that is so
innovative _ and lovely _ that it should have been the model for
the Euro.
</P>
<P>
   From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, a graphic designer named
R.D.E. Oxenaar applied a personal esthetic to his nation's
currency, and in doing so demonstrated that the specific could be
universal. In his designs, Oxenaar used sunflowers, lighthouses and
birds and surrounded them with a kaleidoscopic mix of patterns that
please the eye and protect the money from counterfeiting.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxenaar tradition was carried forward by a designer of
television graphics, Jaap Drupsteen, who created a new series of
guilder notes covered with vivid, eye-catching motifs as hypnotic
as the drawings of M.C. Escher.
</P>
<P>
   Both Oxenaar and Drupsteen were unsuccessful entrants in the
Euro competition. For that reason, Drupsteen is reluctant to give
his opinion on the new notes, but Oxenaar, now retired, readily
offers an assessment: ``Really miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxenaar mentioned that each competitor was sent a package of ``a
safe range of historical'' images chosen by art historians, ``a
kind of European salad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw them all in the dust bin,'' Oxenaar said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Kaliena did not.
</P>
<P>
   It was a ``lost chance to do something interesting in Europe,''
said Lo Breier, a partner in the graphic design and advertising
agency Buero X, based Vienna and Hamburg. Breier, an Austrian,
argues that the competition should have been an opportunity to
reflect on what it means to be European.
</P>
<P>
   Breier was one of a handful of designers invited by the magazine
Der Spiegel to perform an unauthorized redesign of the Euro coins.
The coins show maps of the continent (sans the two non-members
Switzerland and Norway). Each member mints its own Euro coins and
is allowed to place whatever it chooses on the flip side. The
German coins feature the Brandenburg gate and an updated version of
their federal eagle. The editors of Der Spiegel, dismayed by the
predictability, asked Breier and three others for alterations.
</P>
<P>
   Breier recommended drilling two holes in the coins so they could
double as buttons, a way to give the coins practical value in case
they turn out to be worthless.

SURVEY: SMALL BUSINESS SUPPORTS HMO CURBS, EVEN IF COSTS RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A majority of small-business owners said they
support proposals to rein in the managed care industry even if
regulation resulted in higher health insurance premiums, according
to a new survey released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And about half said they would absorb the extra cost, with only
a tiny percentage saying they would drop coverage for employees
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The survey _ produced jointly by the Henry J. Kaiser Family
Foundation of Menlo Park, Calif., and Harvard University _ is the
latest salvo in a growing battle between the managed care industry
and critics who say its cost-conscious methods of providing health
care often deny patients thorough medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care is fast rising as a hot-button political issue,
with many Democrats supporting increased government controls and
many Republicans scrambling to forge other solutions, mindful of
the traditional support they receive from business groups opposed
to government solutions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is considering at least 10 measures to control managed
care, which now accounts for more than 80 percent of
employer-sponsored health care coverage in the United States. The
proposals would require managed care plans to give consumers more
information on how they operate and open up appeal routes when
patients are denied insurance coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The most prominent bill is sponsored by a Republican, Rep.
Charles Norwood of Georgia. It would permit lawsuits against health
insurers when denials of coverage result in deteriorating health or
death. A proposal sponsored by congressional Democrats contains the
same controversial feature.
</P>
<P>
   The survey questioned 800 small-business executives who employee
100 or fewer employees, and 594 said they offer health insurance,
with the remainder saying that high cost prevents them from
providing coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Of those answering a question about proposals to control managed
care, 89 percent said they favor requiring health plans to divulge
more information about coverage; 88 percent favored allowing
employees to appeal managed care decisions; 75 percent would permit
patients to have direct access to specialists instead of having to
go first to a primary-care doctor, and 61 percent would let
patients sue managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents were asked whether their support would change if the
measures drove up premium prices. Sixty-nine percent said they
would still support the information requirement; 72 percent would
still support appeals; 59 percent would still support direct access
to specialists, and 51 percent would still support patient
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Among those offering health insurance, 50 percent said they
would absorb the cost if premiums were to rise between $1 and $5 a
month per employee, 33 percent said they would pass on some of the
cost to employees, 9 percent said they would pass on the entire
cost and 1 percent said they would drop coverage entirely. The
remaining 7 percent said they would switch plans or didn't know
what they would do.
</P>
<P>
   If premium costs were to go up $15 to $20 a month for each
employee, 45 percent said they would absorb all costs, 35 percent
said they would pass some of it on to employees, 8 percent said
they would pass on the whole cost, and 3 percent said they'd drop
coverage entirely. The remaining 9 percent said they would switch
plans or had no idea what they would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support from small employers for consumer protection
regulation ... is surprising,'' said Drew Altman, president of the
Kaiser Family Foundation, which traces its roots to Henry J.
Kaiser, the industrialist who was the moving force behind
Kaiser-Permanente, one of the nation's largest managed care
companies. The foundation and Kaiser-Permanente are not connected.
</P>
<P>
   The prediction ``that many (in the survey) would pass along
costs to workers should serve as another reminder that in health
reform, there is no free lunch,'' Altman said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, support for controls on managed care among small-business
owners runs counter to predictions by the National Federation of
Independent Business that controls would be disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   The 600,000-member NFIB has argued that proposals now before
Congress would drive up premium costs and lead vulnerable
small-business owners to drop coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the people we represent, we get a very different reaction
in terms of their ability to provide coverage,'' said Dan Danner,
chief lobbyist for the NFIB and chairman of the Health Benefits
Coalition, an alliance of business and managed care groups opposing
managed care legislation. ``The smallest of small businesses are
still extremely cost-sensitive, and an increase in cost we believe
without question would have a significant impact on coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Danner pointed to a study last year by the Fairfax, Va.-based
Lewin Group, which said that 400,000 workers would lose health
insurance for each percentage point that premiums rise.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Levitt, director of the Kaiser-Harvard survey, defended
its results, calling them ``an accurate picture of how small
business views these issues in general. Small-business owners
themselves do not view these consumer protect proposals as a
disaster for them.''

SOMETHING UNUSUAL FROM THE PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If President Clinton's speech defending his planned trip to
China was what it appeared to be, it was a speech of great
historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   OK, you're thinking, what was so significant about it?
</P>
<P>
   Well, if the speech was what it seemed _ we are talking about
Clinton, so the operative word is ``if'' _ then it marked a rare
political occurrence: Bill Clinton took a stand on principle.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, it is not a good idea to assume that there is any
meaningful connection between what Clinton seems to be doing and
what he is actually doing. He is a master of illusion in matters of
this sort.
</P>
<P>
   But if Clinton was acting out of some self-serving, ulterior
motive in telling his critics to take a hike, it's difficult to
imagine what that motive might be. The easiest thing in the world
for him to do would have been to call off the upcoming trip to
China, and thereby disarm some of his surliest detractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going because I think it's the right thing to do for our
country,'' the president proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get plenty of argument on that point, especially from
critics of his policy allowing the transfer of U.S. satellite
technology to China when Chinese interests were allegedly
attempting to influence the American presidential election by
making substantial contributions to Clinton's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have gone so far as to describe Clinton's action as
treasonous, a description that surely falls into the category of
hyperbole. But the timing of the decision, along with other
questions about foreign campaign donations, obviously left the
president open to suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted in his speech that there was nothing unsavory
about the technology transfer, maintaining that he was merely
continuing a policy approved by President Reagan and implemented by
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional committees are tripping all over one another in
their rush to investigate the policy, so we ought to find out soon
enough if Clinton was leveling with the public or engaging in one
of his patented tap dances around the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he seemed to be standing up to his critics in a
situation where he apparently had little to gain and plenty to
lose. Being a lame duck who must step down at the end of his
current term, Clinton would appear to have no further use for
Chinese campaign contributions _ if he had any use for them in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   And what could Clinton possibly imagine he might gain by
inviting more controversy at a time when he is already up to his
neck in controversy?
</P>
<P>
   True enough, a recent CBS News/''New York Times'' poll found
that 59 percent of those polled believed that Clinton should go
ahead with the China trip. But that would hardly seem to offset the
torrent of criticism that has engulfed Clinton in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech outlined the rationale for his belief that the
United States and the world will be better served by doing business
with China rather than cutting off communication with the most
populous nation on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that ``choosing isolation over engagement
would not make the world safer. It would make it more dangerous.
...
</P>
<P>
   ``It would hinder, not help, the cause of democracy and human
rights in China,'' Clinton added. ``It would set back, not step up,
worldwide efforts to protect the environment. It would cut off, not
open up, one of the world's most important markets.''
</P>
<P>
   America's ability to get along with China, Clinton said, ``will
in large measure help to determine whether the new century is one
of security, peace and prosperity for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must believe all this stuff, or why would he say it?
What possible political benefit could accrue to an American
president who buddies up to a country that just nine years ago
slaughtered pro-democracy demonstrators in its capital city?
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton is Clinton, and you can't help but wonder if what
he believed yesterday is what he'll believe tomorrow.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Ozzie and Harriet. They were America's ideal fantasy
couple in the 1950s. He was a bit goofy, never seemed to have a job
and was always puttering around the two-story Colonial house. She
was an all-purpose Mom who happily wore aprons most of the time and
never seemed to leave the kitchen. Their sons, David and Ricky,
were virtuous and good-looking, two boys whose toughest problems
seemed to be getting a date for the high school prom and asking Dad
for the keys to the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``That family loomed so large in America's psyche,'' said Peter
Jones, the writer and director of a two-hour documentary, ``Ozzie
and Harriet: The Adventures of America's Favorite Family,'' to be
shown Sunday on A&AMP;E. ``The timing was absolutely right for the
deconstruction of the American family on television,'' Jones said,
``and what better case to use but the real family _ the Nelsons _
who had the longest-running family sitcom in history.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, from 1952 to 1966, ``The Adventures of Ozzie and
Harriet'' was a television staple, an American icon, which may have
preceded ``Seinfeld'' as the first show that was really about
nothing. (The Nelsons made an extraordinary 435 episodes; by
contrast, there are 180 episodes of ``Seinfeld.'')
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Leave It to Beaver,'' which ran six years, and ``Father
Knows Best,'' which lasted nine, ``Ozzie and Harriet'' may have
endured far longer because the Nelson family blurred the line
between fiction and reality. The show actually began on radio in
1944, with Ozzie and Harriet playing themselves and actors
portraying the boys. Their real sons joined the show in 1949, and
the whole family made the transition to television.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelsons' television home was a replica of their Hollywood
home and David and Ricky actually grew up before everyone's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   (Ozzie died of cancer in 1975 at the age of 69 ; Harriet died at
85 in 1994 of heart failure and emphysema.)
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who recently won an Emmy with John Fricke for their
acclaimed A&AMP;E ``Biography'' last year of Judy Garland, said that
what surprised him now about talking to the remaining members of
the Nelson family was that most of them seemed, finally, ready to
unburden themselves of intensely private feelings about a show that
not only controlled their lives but, in some ways, left them
confused about their own reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made this documentary unusual is that the family, which
lived so much of their their lives on television, chose to work
through some very private feelings in the same forum,'' said Jones,
a 42-year-old former television journalist whose A&AMP;E documentaries
have dealt with Buster Keaton, Charlie Chaplin, Nat ``King'' Cole
and Jack Benny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was post-modern,'' he said. ``Here you had the Nelsons
dealing with the Nelsons through the medium that created them. They
were talking to each other, through the camera, in a way they
couldn't, face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the documentary also timely is that it comes out just
weeks after the film ``The Truman Show'' opened to the best reviews
of the year. It is a dark comedy directed by Peter Weir and written
by Andrew Niccol, about a man who starts to realize that his entire
life has been a television show and that he must escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``On some level,'' Jones said, ``the Nelsons could be very
personal and very intimate because there was this strange safety
created by cameras and lights. They were struggling to be real
themselves, through the unreality of television. This is what they
knew. They were struggling to escape this candy-coated, white
picket version of themselves because they knew it wasn't true. And
that's `The Truman Show.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson family, in real life, were hardly the Nelsons they
portrayed on television.
</P>
<P>
   As Kris Nelson Tinker, the former wife of Rick Nelson, said on
the documentary: ``I spent my whole life fighting the fairy tale.
First trying to be it, then trying to tell the truth.'' (Ms. Tinker
talked about her and Rick's free fall from a seemingly perfect
couple to a marriage shattered by drugs and other demons.) And as
one of her children, Tracy Nelson, the actress, said, ``There's a
huge discrepancy between what was real and what people think was
real about the Nelson family and the people involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The discrepancies are vast. In contrast to the genial, slightly
vague television character he played, the real-life Ozzie, a
successful band leader in the 1930s, produced, directed and wrote
the shows (he worked all night) and was a dictatorial presence
looming over his family. Although the sitcom seemed to embody
traditional middle-class values, the documentary depicts Ozzie as a
hands-on businessman who thwarted his sons, preventing them from
attending college and reminding them that they were obliged to work
on television.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Harriet Nelson was even more intriguing, and
complicated, than the straitlaced Ozzie Nelson. Formerly Harriet
Hilliard, a platinum blond nightclub and radio star and close
friend of Ginger Rogers, Mrs. Nelson had appeared in vaudeville
since she was 3 years old and on Broadway as a teen-ager. She hung
out at the Cotton Club, began smoking at 13, was briefly married to
an abusive comedian and lived a high-flying life until she fell in
love with Ozzie and handed over her career to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a bombshell,'' Jones said. ``She liked gay people. She
liked a good off-color joke. She enjoyed her cocktails at night.
She had the talent to go on and be a big star, but she made that
decision to be Ozzie's wife. And I don't think years passed when
she didn't think, `What if?'''
</P>
<P>
   But certainly the figure that takes on the most complex and
almost tragic dimension was Rick Nelson (he loathed the name
Ricky), a successful composer and rock star who struggled his
entire life to escape the sanitized one-dimensional image of the
kid brother in the television show. He died in a plane crash on
Dec. 31, 1985, at the age of 45, on the way to a concert in Texas,
at a time when he was struggling to revive his singing career.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Nelson was a truly talented musician, the first
television teen idol,'' Jones said. ``He was a paradox. He was so
charming, so manipulative, but he did not ultimately take
responsibility for his life. He didn't know how to be a grown-up,
which was chilling. He once said that he didn't see himself getting
older. He believed that. In a way, he was trapped by his television
identity.'' (Jones said that living with a strong father had a
personal resonance for him: he grew up in Belair, Calif., and is
the son of Thomas Jones, former longtime chairman of the Northrop
Corp.)
</P>
<P>
   It was music that consumed Rick. Even Ozzie was forced to back
away when Rick, in his early 20s, selected the music and musicians
for his recordings and appearances. Dwight Yoakum, the
country-music star, said in the documentary: ``If you really want
to find an interesting chapter on being subtle, it's Rick Nelson.
And the brilliance of that subtlety.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick's hit songs included ``Travelin' Man,'' ``Hello, Mary
Lou,'' and the sad, personal ``Garden Party,'' which he wrote after
reluctantly making a 1971 appearance at a rock revival at Madison
Square Garden and being booed because of his long hair and style, a
far cry from little Ricky.
</P>
<P>
   ``He harbored that hurt for most of the rest of his life _ that
he could not be accepted by his peers,'' Ms. Tinker said in the
documentary. ``I mean, there was always that wall of little Ricky
the teen-ager in front of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The documentary has already divided the family. Ms. Tinker, the
mother of four of Rick Nelson's children, said over the phone that
she had seen an early version and had been touched by it. Ms.
Tinker's parents were Tom Harmon, the football star, and Elyse
Knox, the movie actress. As the documentary points out, Ms. Tinker
was 17 when she married the 23-year-old Rick Nelson and she was
three months pregnant. Their parents changed the weight on the
birth certificate, with the help of a Santa Monica Hospital, to
pretend the infant was premature.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tinker, the wife of Mark Tinker, a television producer and
director, said she that adored her husband's parents _ ``They were
the first adults who listened to me'' _ but that Rick was somewhat
tormented by his relationship to his father and the show. ``He got
confused about what his role was on the show and what he really
felt,'' she says. ``What was important to Ozzie was keeping the
show on the air, and the boys came second.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Nelson, the older son, who is now 61, said he was
disappointed in the documentary. ``I thought it was going to be a
biography, not `Hard Copy,''' he said, referring to the tabloid
show.``My father is depicted as a Simon Legree-type guy, cracking
the whip. That wasn't the case. My father went to great pains to
see that Rick and I had as normal an upbringing as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the impact of the show on Rick, Nelson, who is now a
director and producer, said: ``It was a double-edged sword. We
stayed on as long as we did because of Rick and Rick's popularity.
My father would have been the first one to admit that. He told us
both that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rick carried with him the onus of Ricky Nelson. We all
get older and grow up. And as he says in the film, if the audience
still sees him as little Ricky, then that's their problem.'' Of the
biography, Nelson said, ``Why not accentuate the positive and
eliminate the negative?''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, though, the Nelson family was not quite
dysfunctional, but close to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelsons, David Halberstam in his book ``The Fifties,'' were
``for all their professional success, very different from the
family depicted on the show, they lived with an immense amount of
pressure and unreconciled issues.'' He went on, ``Chief among these
issues was the fact that Ozzie Nelson had in effect stolen the
childhood of both of his sons and used it for commercial purposes:
he had taken what was most private and made it terribly public.''

   RACINE, Wis. _ I thought I saw my father at Lathrop's furniture
store the other day. He was standing by the Chiclets dispenser,
looking out over an endless sea of walnut gliders and lampshades
swaddled in crisp plastic wrappers. He was carrying his decrepit
leather sample case under his arm, so bursting with fabric swatches
he could barely keep it together with a piece of string.
</P>
<P>
   My father, Allan, was a furniture salesman. He died 20 years
ago, on a December morning when the sky and Lake Michigan were
slate-gray. He was 54 years old. I was 23. In some ways, it doesn't
seem as if much time has passed since he waited for me at O'Hare
field, arms open, at the bottom of the escalator.
</P>
<P>
   He was an ace salesman, ``the king of Milwaukee'' in his day.
But when he died, what he did for a living was still something of a
mystery to my sisters and me. Like many dads of the era, especially
those with daughters, he didn't talk about his work much. But the
swatches _ some nubby beige, some lustrous turquoise _ were
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Every Monday morning during my childhood, he would leave our
house in suburban Chicago and drive to those distant, exotic places
where the tornadoes were _ places like Davenport and Dubuque, Iowa;
Peoria and Rockford, Ill., and Kenosha, Racine, Milwaukee and
Sheboygan, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   We never knew much about what he sold. But my sister Lori
vividly remembers how proud she felt when a coordinated suite of
International Furniture, my father's line, flashed across the
screen in queenly splendor as a prize on ``The Newlywed Game,'' the
tweed accented with print pillows so it looked ravishing on
television.
</P>
<P>
   I visited Schnadig Corp., my father's old employer, and, in the
company of his former partner, Ivan Kushen, followed a bit of his
trail. I wanted to understand that missing dimension of his life,
the one spent between the yellow stripes and white dashes on the
highway. For a moment, I wanted to be surrounded by people who knew
that side of him, take comfort from them. I suppose I was looking
for swatches.
</P>
<P>
   Like my father, the furniture was snug and dependable, the stuff
that made people, including many suburban newlyweds, feel at home.
He went on the road in 1959, traveling the territory in loops to
visit ``dirty front interiors,'' as he was fond of calling them _
faded, largely family-owned Main Street furniture dealerships that
were his customers and today are vanishing.
</P>
<P>
   Schnadig Corp., founded in 1952, specialized in the kind of
middle-American furniture that long defined Chicago as a furniture
hub. Schnadig had a predilection for carved built-in tables that
would punctuate the ends of sofas and rope-turned feet resembling
threads on a screw. My first and only piece of my father's
furniture was a chocolate-brown velveteen sectional whose pieces
seemed mysteriously to repel each other, like magnetic poles.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest seller was Corona, a Mediterranean-inspired
collection, now campy looking, made glamorous with finials and gold
crushed-velvet seats. To my father, selling Corona was a
no-brainer; it still leaps off the pages of vintage catalogs. With
a mixture of fascination and horror, I received the news from Ivan
that it was probably Corona that put me through college, a
revelation somewhat akin to hauling up a fishing net and
discovering a giant squid.
</P>
<P>
   They call such furniture ``borax'' today. To my father, a born
optimist with rabid enthusiasm for many things _ including his
daughters, the Chicago Bears, the latest gadget and his own
birthday _ furniture was a commodity. We didn't grow up with
International furniture in our house. (My mother preferred modern,
boxy Paul McCobb.) But although it wasn't to his taste, he never
seemed condescending about what he sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't care what it looked like or if he liked it
personally,'' Ivan said as we drove up Highway 41 toward Milwaukee,
the road dipping occasionally beneath concrete viaducts. ``What
your father was really a genius at was selling a dealer what the
dealer could sell.''
</P>
<P>
   He was a furniture matchmaker. He rarely remembered order
numbers, describing pieces by drawing pictures of them in the air.
His sales technique could resemble the scoreboard erupting in
victory at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your father could work up a sweat selling an ottoman,'' Ivan
recalled with palpable affection. ``That's the way he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The qualities that made him a great father served him well in
business. In contrast to what happens today, when goods are
automatically reordered by computer and calling on customers every
60 to 90 days is no longer necessary, furniture dealers bought the
salesman as much as, if not more than, the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days we used to buy from our friends, whether the
product was good or not,'' recalled Murray Brown, who bought from
my dad at Lathrop's in Racine and now owns Brown's Furnishings and
Design in Boca Raton and Jupiter, Fla. ``That personal touch _
having dinner, meeting the family _ is missing today. It was all
one big friendship. Now you can't find out who owns the company.''

 RACINE, Wis.: the company.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   His warmth was like the roads he traveled: uncomplicated,
without curves. He had no visible demons and an almost collegiate
sense of mirth. If he'd been a room, my father would have been a
patio. ``It was a loose, comfortable attitude he had,'' said Sondra
Rosin, who was hired by my dad in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very casual,'' recalled Norman Waxman, who was my
father's sales manager. ``He didn't get shaken up too much. He was
serious about business, but his demeanor wasn't.'' You always knew
how he felt.
</P>
<P>
   The company is alive and well today, even though many of the
small family-owned stores my father sold to no longer exist. The
furniture Ivan Kushen and other Schnadig colleagues sell to stores
like Seaman's, Haverty's and Sears Homelife has gotten far more
sophisticated over the years; those stores now have to compete with
discounters like Value City and chic chains like Pottery Barn.
</P>
<P>
   Tastes have changed for the better. People are ``globally
exposed today,'' in the words of Don Belgrad, the company's
chairman. ``People in Iowa have access to as much information as
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   At former customers of my father's, like Bachman's in Milwaukee
and Ingrassia in Rockford, the sales floors are still filled with
furniture wearing the Schnadig hangtag. It is still clustered in
intimate groupings, tables set with knickknacks and polished
silverware as if company were expected.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure my father would have sold the heck out of them. On one
level, he believed in his furniture, and like most Chicago sports
fans, he had that competitive urge.
</P>
<P>
   When he got sick, he was certain he would win. He would
outmaneuver the cancer as surely as he outmaneuvered traffic on the
Edens Expressway, occasionally driving on the shoulder to do it. He
remained upbeat, going down to the furniture market in High Point,
N.C. _ where he once tried to train a parrot to talk dirty to the
competition _ two months before he died. His last words were ``I'm
going to lick this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   At least a thousand swatches have come and gone since then. And
somehow, being able to drive down those roads, even for a moment,
was to be reconnected again. It turns out that the man whose
laughter and lightness sold who knows how many love seats, whom
people eagerly looked forward to seeing, was the same Dad I knew.
The details remain fuzzy, but the aura is clear.
</P>
<P>
   And I know that no matter how old I am, or even how wise a
parent I become, a small, quiet corner of me will always be a young
girl in Chicago, looking for her father at the bottom of the
escalator.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Since a file is a relatively simple tool, a piece of hardened
steel with teeth cut across the surface, using it should be fairly
straightforward and easy.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, all one has to do is push the file across the
work surface and drag it back to the starting position. Actually
this procedure can damage the work surface and dull the file.
Learning to file is not difficult, but proper filing depends upon
maintaining the right hand and arm position so that the tool moves
correctly over the workpiece. However, it only takes a little
practice to get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Most files are sold without handles. Never use a file without a
handle because the bare tang, the tapered, handle end, can cause
injury. File handles are sold at most hardware stores and home
centers, and one size handle will usually fit a wide range of
files. Depending on the type of handle, you only need to push or
twist it onto the tang.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the workpiece is especially large, it should be clamped
securely in a vise, ideally at elbow height. Protect the workpiece
by sandwiching it between soft wood blocks and position it low,
close to the jaws of the vise. This will prevent noisy vibrations
that can dull the file.
</P>
<P>
   The are two filing techniques: cross filing and draw filing.
Cross filing is used to remove material and reshape the work. Draw
filing is a finishing technique.
</P>
<P>
   Cross filing has many applications, so master this technique
first. Grasp the file handle with one hand and grip the file tip
with the fingers of the other hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hold the file horizontally and push it across the workpiece at a
sight angle. Exert enough pressure to insure even cutting. Too much
pressure will cause the file to skip and the work to vibrate and
chatter; too little will dull the file teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Do not allow the file to rock as you push or you could round
edges of the workpiece. Instead try to maintain the horizontal
line. The file only cuts on the push stroke, so lift it off on the
return stroke. Dragging the tool back will dull the teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Stop periodically to check the work surface for high spots or
depressions. Test the flatness with a straight edge. If the work is
curved, with the center higher than the edges, you are applying too
much pressure at the beginning and end of the stroke. If the work
is dished, with the center lower than the edges, the starting and
finishing pressure is too light. Changing the file angle slightly
will also help to erase any file tracks, the shallow grooves made
by the file teeth.
</P>
<P>
   After cross filing, the surface of the work is apt to be rough
with file marks. Draw filing will put a smooth finish on the piece
and remove the file marks. Use a single-cut file. Grip the file in
both hands and hold it at right angles to the workpiece. Whether
you push the tool away or pull it toward you depends upon the
position of the file handle. If it is on your right side, the
cutting stroke will be away from you (a push stroke). If the handle
is on your left side, execute a pull stroke. Always lift the file
off the work on the return stroke. After filing, wrap the tool in
emery cloth and draw it back and forth across to polish the work
surface.
</P>
<P>
   During the filing operation, the file teeth may become clogged
with metal or wood particles. These particles must be removed or
they will scratch the work surface. This clogged condition is
called ''pinning.'' It can usually be prevented with ordinary
blackboard chalk. Fill all the gaps between the file teeth by
rubbing the chalk liberally along the file. Always chalk the file
before working on soft metals or draw filing.
</P>
<P>
   Even with chalking, it is necessary to clean the file
periodically with a file card.
</P>
<P>
   The file card is flat brush with short wire bristles. To clean
the file, hold the card so it is parallel to the rows of teeth,
then pull it across the file. To dislodge stubborn metal particles,
use a metal pick (there may be one in a slot in the handle of the
file card) or a sharpened nail.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to store your files is by hanging them in a slotted
rack or placing them in a drawer with wooden partitions. Files
should never be allowed to rest on top of each other. This could
dull or chip their teeth. To keep your files from rusting, store
them away from water and moisture but do not oil them. Oil causes a
file to skip across a work surface.

     TALES OF YOUTH DRUG USE SHOW NEED FOR
PREVENTION, ANTIDRUG OFFICIAL SAYS
 &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An undercover officer from Dayton, Ohio, told how
he bought LSD from a junior high school student.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old Maryland girl charted her tumble into drug and
alcohol abuse from the age of 9, using ``anything that I could get
my hands on.''
</P>
<P>
   And a pediatrician recalled treating a 7-year-old girl, exposed
to drugs and alcohol before birth, who tried to stab another
second-grader at school with a pencil.
</P>
<P>
   Experiences such as these, related at a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing Wednesday, show why youth anti-drug campaigns
that have dwindled since the 1980s should be reinstated and the
legalization of marijuana should be shunned, said Barry McCaffrey,
director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new generation of kids,'' McCaffrey told the panel.
``We have to start over.''
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are becoming more accessible, leading children to
experiment with more dangerous drugs at an earlier age, McCaffrey
said. He said one in four 12th-graders have used an illegal drug in
the past month.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he was ``astonished'' by the ``slick
misinformation propaganda campaign'' that aims to legalize
marijuana and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to hold sway in the judgment of people who
should know better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris, the 24-year-old undercover officer who testified behind a
glass shield to protect his identity, said that while assigned to
two high schools in an unidentified upper-middle-class Midwestern
neighborhood, he made multiple purchases of LSD from a junior high
school student.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students in this high school consumed at least 200 hits of
acid every two weeks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rachel, the 16-year-old Maryland girl who testified about her
plunge into drug and alcohol abuse, said she experimented with LSD,
cocaine, PCP and other drugs. She said she has been drug-free for
eight months, after several failed attempts to quit that left her
feeling isolated and depressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated myself, and I had no friends that liked me for who I
was,'' Rachel said, who asked that her last name not be publicized.
``They only liked me for the drugs I had.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Statistics show a steady growth in drug use, including a rise in
the number of eight-graders who have used marijuana from 10 percent
in 1991 to 23 percent in 1997, McCaffrey reported.
</P>
<P>
   And while marijuana is still the most widely use drug among
young people, the use of heroin and methamphetamine stimulants is
growing, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heroin is now pure and cheap _ as affordable as a ticket to a
movie,'' said Nancy Auer, president of the American College of
Emergency Physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government spends about $16 billion a year on 70
programs in 57 different departments and agencies to fight illegal
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey, emphasizing that prevention is the best way to combat
the drug problem, said a $195 million youth-oriented media campaign
launched in 12 pilot cities last year _ including Atlanta _ is
``already outstripping expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug prevention hot lines whose phone numbers were publicized
received at least twice as many calls than before the campaign,
McCaffrey said. The campaign is to be expanded nationwide next
month.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN _ Perhaps no one in America has sacrificed
as much for marital relations in America as Bill Bradford II, one
of the inventors of the Johnny-Light. Two years ago, Bradford, a
resident of Burleson near Fort Worth, gave up a $90,000-a-year job

your mind about a person you don't know well, but cherish like you
cherish unexpected laughter and a crazy, odd meeting. Mrs. Bryan's
husband was editor of The Atlanta Journal, a newspaper we on The
Atlanta Constitution considered our unlikely, unloved competition.
But we did like the Bryans and rejoice in Ellen's humor and
goodwill.(Sibley, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED 6/16.

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ We live in an enlightened age, right? More
women are running companies, fighting fires, mending bones. So
what's wrong with Hollywood? There women are given the boot just
about the time they develop the grace, wisdom and strength that
truly makes them attractive. (McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED.

<P>
   REAL-LIFE _ So, let that Giuliani fellow worry about all those
folks up in New York City, the ones who need a hug and a smile and
a weekend in the country. I've got enough to keep me going right
here. And that's no exaggeration. (Minor, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   SALAMANDER-POEM _ AUSTIN _ U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks,
mixing rhyme and reason, kept the Barton Springs Pool open by
denying attempts to stop the city from cleaning the spring-fed pool
that is habitat to an endangered salamander and a cool respite for
Central Texans. In a 16-line poem and a 20-page opinion, the judge
took literary and legal swings at the Endangered Species Act,
ruling that the city's cleaning does not harm the 3-inch
salamander, which lives only in the local springs. (Copelin, Austin

   BEER-MSKUBE _ Along with the darker Altbiers of nearby
Dusseldorf and the spritzy white beers of Berlin, Kolsch is the
least familiar of German styles in the United States. It's a
different kind of ale (an English word Germans never use), light as
a sister's kiss, pale as summer corn, served in a cylindrical

   YBORFLA _ TAMPA _ I strolled and shopped by day and crawled bar
to bar at night. This is the way to see Tampa's Ybor City. Ybor
City draws huge weekend crowds for its nightlife. Nightclubs are
shoulder-to-shoulder along the main street, Seventh Avenue, like
cheapskates at an open bar. That wasn't the case about 20 years ago

   SEASIDE _ SEASIDE, Fla. _ This small town built next to the Gulf
of Mexico gives contradictory first impressions. You see a
Victorian village with turn-of-the-century turrets, verandas and
picket fences. But on closer inspection it looks like a movie set
too perfect to be a real town. In fact, Seaside, which was the
location for the new movie The Truman Show starring Jim Carrey, is
not historic, unless 17 years _ the first house was built in 1981 _
counts as vintage. (Blackerby, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

<P>
   SEASIDEFLA-ARCHITECTURE _ SEASIDE, Fla. _ So what do people do
in this Architectural Digest-perfect town? One would think the Gulf

draw sightseers, many of whom are architects and urban planners,
who come here to admire and photograph the real estate. (Blackerby,

   SUWANNEE-HOUSEBOAT _ SUWANNEE, Fla. _ I'm on the Suwannee. The
houseboat is real and we're cruising lazily up the river
immortalized in Stephen Foster's song Old Folks at Home, a perfect
place to remember old daydreams. Our cruise begins at Miller's
Marina in the town of Suwannee, where the river empties into the
gulf on Florida's West Coast. The lower area of the river is a
national wildlife refuge. (Zent, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN _ Perhaps no one in America has sacrificed
as much for marital relations in America as Bill Bradford II, one
of the inventors of the Johnny-Light. Two years ago, Bradford, a

 &HT;    Former UT coach Penders considered for George Washington job
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Penders, one of two finalists for the head basketball
coaching job at George Washington University, said he does not
consider himself a candidate for the position ``at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Penders, a former University of Texas coach, and George
Washington assistant Kevin Clark are the frontrunners for the job
at the Atlantic-10 school in Washington D.C. A third finalist,
Delaware head coach and George Washington alum Mike Brey, withdrew
his name late Monday (June 15).
</P>
<P>
   The George Washington job opened when Mike Jarvis accepted the
position at St. John's after eight years with the Colonials.
</P>
<P>
   Sources indicate George Washington Athletic Director Jack
Kvancz, a longtime friend of Penders, wants Penders and Clark to
meet with school president Steven Joel Trachtenberg, as well as the
vice president for student services. The school hopes to name its
coach this week, perhaps as soon as Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Penders was in San Diego Tuesday on a working holiday with his
wife and daughter. He said he has a broadcasting audition later
this week with ESPN at its studios in Bristol, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for any (coaching) jobs,'' said Penders, who
has a clause in his new contract with Host Communications that
allows him to explore other coaching opportunities. ``It would take
a situation where I knew and trusted the athletic director to get
me to even consider it, but right now I'm excited about the TV
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say I'd never do it (return to coaching)
because that might not be truthful, but I don't know,'' added
Penders, 53, who in 10 seasons at Texas became the school's
winningest men's coach with a record of 208-110 before resigning
under pressure on April 2. ``I don't have an urge to get back into
coaching, but if the right situation came along where I knew the
people involved, that would be a factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Penders knows several administrators at George Washington,
including Kvancz, a childhood friend who visited Penders for two
days in Austin last week. Both he and Penders said they did not
talk specifically about Penders taking the George Washington job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get to that point,'' Kvancz said late last week.
``He's obviously a quality candidate. But I just wanted to see what
his interest might be and pick his brain a little about other
people out there. We'll have more discussions if that's the way
we're going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Penders said he has not spoken to anyone from George Washington
since Kvancz returned to Washington last Thursday.

 &HT;    Forget New York, my tiny world has worries enough
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There are currently 7,380,906 people in
New York City, and I know this because I recently visited there and
spent my entire 96 or so hours _ no, no, not seeing ``Les Miz''
(that's what they call it up there) or visiting that much
talked-about Ellis Island. I spent my four days in true midwestern
form:
</P>
<P>
   Worrying about every single person I saw.
</P>
<P>
   All right already. My husband is after me to stop exaggerating,
so I have to confess. A few people up there do seem to be doing OK.
They live in this cool area called, what is it again? Oh yeah, the
Upper East Side, and I know they're fine because they can afford to
pay big rents and buy shoes with real leather uppers. Plus, a few
of them actually looked happy.
</P>
<P>
   There is much awe in my heart for the hardy souls of New York
City who each morning rise and shine. They have bosses and kids and
lunches to pack. They have places to go and people to meet. They
have lives, all 7 million of them. But, good grief, the obstacles
that stand in their way at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Crowded subways. Litter on the street. Gross-looking public
schools. If friends from college ever dare to visit, the
three-night hotel bill looks like a mortgage payment. And the smell
that floats up from those sidewalk grates. Good heavens! Why can't
that Rudy Giuliani guy leave the taxi drivers alone and do
something about that?
</P>
<P>
   Simmer down, says a man I work with, a man who actually _ are
you ready for this? _ grew up in New York City. If I lived up there
I wouldn't notice all this stuff. Yes, yes, he says. It is dirty
and people do seem a little distracted and, of course no one
establishes eye contact or smiles and says hello. That's because _
and he explained this oh-so-well that I wish I could remember it
word for word. It's because the people in New York City have
culture. And, from what I can gather, access to Connecticut on the
weekends doesn't hurt any either.
</P>
<P>
   Broadway shows. Great museums. Good Chinese restaurants. And,
this is my favorite part, you can walk to everything! What that
means, I guess, is that if you want to, you can walk to the Upper
East Side and touch a real tree.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not one to make rash decisions. I'm even trying to give
those men in the Southern Baptist church another chance, although
they'd better damn well hurry up. But I must tell you, I am not
made to survive in a city where everyone looks as though they need
a hug.
</P>
<P>
   We have a joke in our house, which _ as it turns out _ is no
joke at all. It's about the size of My World. My World, you see, is
small. The grocery store is a mile to the south. My kid's school is
2 miles to the east. The video store is right down from the grocery
store. The post office is in between the two. And the newspaper
office is smack in the middle. Every once in a while I do venture 4
or 5 miles outside this world to visit a good friend who has the
gall to reside outside my boundaries. But I like her, and her
children and husband are nice, so it's worth it.
</P>
<P>
   Inside this world are just enough worries to keep me going. The
odd homeless woman who wears layers of wool in the summer heat. The
girls around the corner whose mothers let them roam the
neighborhood freely. Why, just six months or so ago my best
friend's car was stolen right out of their driveway!
</P>
<P>
   So, let that Giuliani fellow worry about all those folks up in
New York City, the ones who need a hug and a smile and a weekend in
the country. I've got enough to keep me going right here. And
that's no exaggeration.

 &HT;    Area businessmen help Austin hurdler continue her career
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The group of 50-something businessmen recently gathered
in the north end zone of Royal-Memorial Stadium to watch their
newest project gracefully glide over a series of hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The men had never seen Tracy Mattes, a transplanted Austinite by
way of Wisconsin and Arizona, run her specialty, the 400-meter
hurdles. Yet they had been giving her about $1,000 a month since
January so she could continue training without having to take more
than one job to pay the bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine was telling me about her,'' Ken Wendler said
as he watched Mattes take on the next hurdle. ``He told me about
how she had been a world-class hurdler, how she got malaria in
South Africa and was having a real hard time getting herself going
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a gal working part time but training full time, who
was working her heart out to try and make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattes will run in the U.S. Track and Field Championships this
week in New Orleans. Later this summer, she will fly to Europe to
participate in a series of meets that pays thousands of dollars to
the winners.
</P>
<P>
   The men, whom Mattes calls her ``angels,'' recently upped their
financial support, pooling together enough money to pay for her
plane fare to New Orleans and her expenses during her weeklong
stay. They intend to partially pay for her training until she can
attract sponsors such as Nike, which financially supports a number
of top athletes. Mattes also works as an assistant producer at
KXAN-TV. She trains at Memorial Stadium in the afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsements will come to her if Mattes, 28, can get back to
her pre- malaria form. A month before the 1996 U.S. Olympic Trials,
Mattes was ranked seventh in the world and fifth in the United
States in her event. She finished ninth at the trials and didn't
make the team, but still was able to hang on to her sponsorships
that paid about 75 percent of her living expenses. She got a
part-time job working as a television producer to pick up the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Mattes has been sponsored by Nike, the U.S. Olympic Committee,
Kodak and Bausch &AMP; Lomb. But when she contracted malaria while
competing in South Africa in January 1997, she almost was forced to
give up dream. Her sponsorships, which were based on her on-track
performances, dried up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being in the emergency room in Johannesburg,'' said
Mattes, who moved to Austin to train with University of Texas
assistant Dan Pfaff about a month before her trip to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hospital was horrible, it was a scene out of an old horror
film. I had to take the whole summer off just to get healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattes likely contracted malaria, which still is found in South
and Central America, Africa and Asia, through a bite from an
infected mosquito. The chills and high fever forced her to the
hospital and then out of competition until this spring.
</P>
<P>
   She said she never contemplated retiring to concentrate on a
career in television. She was forced to use her savings to pay
$10,000 in medical bils. By October, when she started training
again, she worked 25 hours a week at KXAN and 30 hours a week as a
clerk at a state agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `This really sucks. I'm 27 and I'm just about
to peak and then this happens,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters, she said, ``came in at just the nick of time. I
didn't know whether I could continue (training and competing) or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   She has run a time of 58.76 seconds in the 400 hurdles, which
equaled the qualifying standard for the U.S. meet. But her group of
financial supporters, who are lawyers, contractors and developers,
will not be there to watch.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's running in the Olympics in Australia, then I'm
there,'' Wendler said. ``I think that would be real neat.''

A WAGNERIAN MATCH: GRAND OPERA AND GRAND CANYON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Neb.)   (ja) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ Seven thousand feet up and a basso rumble
from the Grand Canyon is not a place where Franz Ehgartner expected
to find himself. A retired pharmacist from Graz, Austria, Ehgartner
had been to the United States only once before, last year, to see
the Wagner ``Ring'' Cycle at the Metropolitan Opera in New York.
But here he was on his 80th birthday at Ardrey Auditorium on the
campus of Northern Arizona University, between Act I and Act II of
``Gotterdammerung,'' the final opera of the ``Ring,'' presented by
the Arizona Opera Company.
</P>
<P>
   It was his 50th ``Ring'' or thereabouts since 1935, Ehgartner
said, in a translation from the German provided by another
operagoer (Heidi Herrmann of Seattle, who was completing her 33rd
``Ring''). ``I would not have come to America if it were not for
the `Ring,''' said Ehgartner, who was wearing a button with the
legend, ``Siegfried for President.'' A Wagnerite of substantial
pedigree, having 112 ``Die Meistersinger's'' under his belt as
well, he added: ``In particular I wanted to see a traditional
`Ring.' And I knew if Glynn Ross was doing it, it would be safe to
come and not see a modern version.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the confounding reputation of Ross, the general director
of the Arizona Opera for the last 15 years and of the Seattle Opera
Company for 20 years before that. He is an impresario openly
disdainful of the recent penchant for trickery like Rhinemaidens on
bungee cords and Valkyries on merry-go-rounds. ``I take my `Ring'
very seriously,'' he said. But he nonetheless was audacious enough
to put a place like Flagstaff on the international ``Ring''
circuit. ``When I talk to people in Germany, they call this `der
Vildenvest,''' said the baritone Edward Crafts, who has known Ross
for 35 years and sings Wotan in Arizona. ``I say, yeah, we're doing
der `Ring' in der Vildenvest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross is to retire, at 83, at the end of June, having staged four
``Rings'' here and 20 in Seattle, two each June from 1975 through
1984. (The new director, Speight Jenkins, has continued to stage
``Rings,'' though not annually.) ``Seattle is now a `Ring' town,''
Ms. Herrmann said. Even though a year removed from a mild stroke,
Ross is still a man who flashes both the imperious and gregarious
sides that make a showman. He speaks loudly _ his hearing is on the
wane _ and with the assurance that people are listening. He was
born in South Omaha, Neb., and began his opera career in Los
Angeles as an assistant director for a production of ``Faust'' in
1940. But after World War II, during which he was injured in North
Africa and then ran a military hotel in Italy, he assumed he'd be
going into the hotel business as a civilian.
</P>
<P>
   It was on a cross-country drive with his new Italian wife,
Angelamaria Solimene (they've been married 52 years; everyone calls
her Gio), that he made the pivotal decision of his career. They
were visiting the Four Corners, half a day's drive from here across
the painted desert, where Arizona meets New Mexico, Colorado and
Utah. ``We were in the motel, and my wife said to me, `Do you want
to go into hotels or go into opera?''' he said. ``And I said,
`Opera, of course.'''
</P>
<P>
   He is known as a populist promoter of opera in general and
Wagner in particular. In Seattle, long before the Broadway show
``Rent,'' he advertised a production of ``La Boheme'' as a show
about sex and drugs, and promoted a Richard Strauss work with the
phrase ``Get ahead with `Salome,''' using print graphics borrowed
from ``The Rocky Horror Picture Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Such use of humor and irreverence in advertising, he said, ``is
probably my biggest contribution to opera in America.'' For years
he has been comparing the ``Ring'' to sex for reporters who ask
what makes Wagner so special. ``It has to be performed
contiguously,'' he said in an interview, ``within a proper
circumstance and with a proper attitude.'' Excuse me, but hasn't he
said this before? ``I have my script,'' he acknowledged with an
embarrassed grin. ``But I mean sex in the primordial, Darwinian,
survival-of-the-species kind of way, not as an entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been called, in print, ``the most affable megalomaniac in
opera'' and ``the bantam of the opera,'' and occasionally worse, a
reflection of the hoity-toity opera world's occasional
umbrage-taking at the used-car salesmanship with which Ross tends
to put across his ideas.
</P>
<P>
   The Flagstaff ``Ring'' was born shortly after Ross came to
Arizona, where the opera company, which performs a regular season
in Tucson and Phoenix, had hired him, among other things, to
blacken $750,000 of red ink. It was on a flight over the Grand
Canyon that he had the idea. ``It seemed like a natural, the `Ring'
at the Grand Canyon, the grandeur of both,'' he said. ``It would
make a good bite for the press. And it so happens there's a Wotan
Mountain here.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did in Seattle, he put on each of the individual operas
during consecutive regular seasons before doing the whole cycle, to
form a company and create the sets. (This is one reason the budget
for the entire ``Ring'' this year is a minuscule $1.3 million;
another is that the singers work for cut-rate salaries. Ross, a
master of penury, has balanced 34 consecutive budgets. ``I think
that's unique,'' he said.)
</P>
<P>
   His marketing of opera is tied to the location. Thus, the
audience for the ``Ring'' is almost entirely separate from the
subscription audience in Tucson and Phoenix, and the visitors to
Flagstaff, like Ehgartner, have spent their off days on organized
tours of the Grand Canyon and attending lectures comparing German
mythology with Hopi mythology. The ``Ring'' they saw was
uncluttered, even spare, the scenery almost entirely consisting of
projections on a screen behind the stage. The action took place on
a bare raised platform, so that the duets, with the characters
stalking each other, often had the feel of a wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   But the voices _ including George Gray as Siegfried and Karen
Bureau as Brunnhilde _ were powerful. Some of the aficionados,
including Ehgartner, were distressed by some of the unconventional
staging decisions: that both Siegfried and Gunther are onstage
during the deception of Brunnhilde, for instance, and that after
Siegfried's death both Wotan and Siegmund are brought back to view
the body. The director, Lutz Seelig, suffered as a result during
the curtain call. ``He ruined the entire `Ring' for me,'' said
Leigh Metcalf, a high school teacher from Fullerton, Neb., who was
seeing his 21st ``Ring'' and who booed lustily as Seelig appeared
from the wings for a bow.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely anyone held any of this against Ross. Before the
opening curtain of ``Gotterdammerung,'' he appeared onstage to say
that the conductor, Stefan Minde, would be conducting even though
he was ill and might have to be replaced in mid-performance. But
even Minde's curtain call after he lasted through the five-hour
performance did not elicit the response that Ross' appearance
beforehand did. The audience stood and applauded. ``Bravo!'' they
cried. ``Bravo!''

<P>
   You wouldn't know it to look at me, thank goodness, but my
thighs are pretty good friends, touching just enough so I never
forget that they're there, loving each other.
</P>
<P>
   This generally doesn't bother me until my annual visit to Dr.
Langham's office, when that cute skinny nurse announces, ``Um,
looks like 'bout 145.'' I step off the scale and want to strangle
her. I grumble about the scale being all wrong, and wonder why they
can't get the thing fixed. It's no wonder I don't own one.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, I think I might take my husband up on those
morning walks. Maybe I ought to use that aerobics video my sister
gave me, or the glide-rider I stood in line to buy months ago.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder if I'm doomed, if it's true what my sisters say about
turning 40, even though I haven't gained a pound in nearly 10
years. I can't forget that heart disease is a leading killer among
African-American women. I worry that one day my heart will explode,
as my mother's did at age 43.
</P>
<P>
   This lasts, of course, only until the next mealtime.
</P>
<P>
   I reason that I'm a perfect size 8. That even though I eat a
lot, I try to eat healthfully and drink lots of water. That despite
what the scale says, I'm not really overweight. It's like my
7-year-old daughter, Asha, said one morning as we prayed: ``Lord,
thank you for the food, because you know we Staples women love to
eat.''
</P>
<P>
   And, you might say, we look like it. The Texas Rangers have
``Pudge'' Rodriguez. I've got Pudge Asha and Pudge Jamila. And me,
I'm just Fat, they tell me.
</P>
<P>
   We laugh. I walk three days one week and quit. I joined the YMCA
so many times, only to quit, that our personnel department told me
I couldn't do it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   So I don't really exercise. Doesn't near-constant movement
account for something? How about cleaning the house? I can seldom
get that done without breaking a sweat. And what about the grocery
shopping, and the mall shopping, and chauffeuring of my daughters
hither and yon?
</P>
<P>
   Who has time for exercise?
</P>
<P>
   The last time I decided to work off my thighs, my daughters and
I put the video in and proceeded to squat, up and down, up and
down. For days thereafter, I could barely walk. Not only could I
not climb the stairs without excruciating pain, I couldn't come
back down. I thought I might die.
</P>
<P>
   My daughters laughed at me, but exercising for them is just as
sporadic. So they rode their bikes twice after that Christmas
morning long ago. So they run through the house instead of walking.
So they perk up at any mention of an aerobics video deal on
television. So what?
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Jamila, my 9-year-old, handed me a note she had
scribbled in pencil informing me that I could purchase an aerobics
video in ``three easy payments'' of $24.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hips-buns-thighs,'' it reads. ``1-800-404-9889; if you don't
see results in 30 days, send it back and get a refund.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. All I need is one more thing to collect dust. Can't eat
it, I'm not buying.

2 WAYS TO HEAR `X-FILES`
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; There are two separate soundtracks to ``The
X-Files'' movie, but there's really nothing mysterious about the
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that's just what they want you to think.
</P>
<P>
   One disc _ at No. 38 this week in the nation's albums chart _ is
driven by new songs from the likes of Foo Fighters, Filter, Tonic,
Ween, the Dust Brothers, Aswad &AMP; Sting, the Cardigans, the Cure,
Bjork and Soul Coughing.
</P>
<P>
   The other CD features Mark Snow's entire instrumental score to
the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (`X-Files' creator) Chris Carter appreciated our sense
of irony and humor and wanted us to apply that to the theme and put
an ironic twist or some level of comedy to it,'' explained Mike
Simpson of the Dust Brothers, the hip Silver Lake production team
who interpreted the show's theme on the songs compilation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the album's producer, David Was (real name Weiss),
said his wish list began with a hundred names, but ``got cut down
to the point where you hope you can get 11 acts and fill in the
rest with stuff that isn't embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   Was, co-founder of the soon-to-reunite '80s dance-rock group Was
(Not Was), added that the process took four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this _ on Monday, you're a genius, on Tuesday,
you're a loser and on Wednesday, you develop a sense of reality,''
said the Tarzana-based Was, who describes himself as a
``dyed-in-the-wool conspiracy buff.''
</P>
<P>
   Was, a longtime ``X-Files'' fan, said while he would never claim
to be abducted by space aliens himself, ``I wouldn't put anything
past the CIA to create mass delusions.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, a longtime new-music fan, was involved in picking the
tracks and developing the songs project. Two years ago, another
``X-Files'' album offered music inspired by the show from Elvis
Costello, Sheryl Crow and others.
</P>
<P>
   Was said one track that got away was a proposed collaboration
between trip-hopper Tricky and Tom Waits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was unlikely, but it came within an inch of
happening,'' Was explained. ``None of these guys could make it to
the other guy's coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights of the songs album on Elektra is X covering
the Doors' ``The Crystal Ship,'' the Cure doing Roxy Music's ``More
Than This'' and Aswad &AMP; Sting performing a reggae version of the
Police's ``Invisible Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``X-Files'' movie opens Friday.

   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

Shahin confesses, he doesn't have any tips. In fact, he doesn't

quite common: Women pack the suitcases, men take pride in
methodically fitting them in the car trunk. (slugged:

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

 &HT;    Genesis set best of 2 worlds
 &HT;    By Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Box sets typically come in two varieties: Those that showcase an
artist's best work in a way that invites a new assessment of it and
those that offer a handful of unreleased rarities for the rabid
fan. This hefty Genesis collection manages to do both.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking the British progressive-rock outfit's most innovative
and indulgent period, this set covers the group from its mid-'60s
days as an art-school collective to its mid-'70s heyday, when
singer-composer Peter Gabriel was its outlandish driving force.
Most of what's here features Gabriel, Tony Banks, Steve Hackett,
Michael Rutherford and Phil Collins _ a partnership that ended in
1975, when Gabriel went solo.
</P>
<P>
   Two discs compile the band's surrealistic opus, ``The Lamb Lies
Down on Broadway,'' from Gabriel's last tour. This much-bootlegged
live L.A. show has been restored and polished to a high gloss in
the studio, spruced up with new vocals and overdubs. Discs three
and four feature more live material _ including the 27-minute epic
``Supper's Ready'' and works from ``Selling England by the Pound''
_ and a hodgepodge of early demos, rough mixes and other oddities
that provide an intriguing, if not always satisfying, glimpse of a
young band in search of a sound.

   This retrospective won't win over new fans or anyone who
preferred the pop appeal of ``Abacab'' to the bat-winged theatrics

satisfying and guilty pleasure that captures the essence of one of
rock's most exploratory, if pretentious, offshoots.

 &HT;    Internet birth a reality even though most couldn't see it
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first delivery shown over the Internet produced a baby boy,
but thousands who turned in couldn't see the birth.
</P>
<P>
   For those who got through, the images were abrupt _ they tended
to freeze _ and blurry at best. Still, thousands tried to see the
birth of 7-pound, 8-ounce Sean, the fourth child of Elizabeth, a
40-year-old woman who didn't want her last name used. Cameras were
discreetly trained on Elizabeth's side and in front of her hospital
bed, but nurses backs blocked any view of the actual delivery.
</P>
<P>
   America's Health Network, which put the delivery on its Internet
site, said there were more than 10 million hits at the Web site
throughout the day. At any one minute, 5,000 viewers were able to
log onto the site.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth and the network said they wanted to help educate
mothers-to-be and quell their fears. But those who logged on may
not have gotten much of an educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit here and say this is the proper method to educate
the public,'' said Peggy Hotz, the department director for
perinatal services at Crawford Long of Hospital of Emory Hospital.
``The problem with the Web is that no one is there to give support
or answer questions that may rise from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who did not rise at the crack of dawn to follow
Elizabeth from her 6 a.m. check-in to her delivery at 10:40 a.m.,
was Christopher Rywalt, a New Jersey resident who tried to showhis
wife's delivery live through the internet last year.
</P>
<P>
   Rywalt, who wrote about the conception and development of their
first baby on a Web site called ``It's Just Another Baby''
(http://www.westnet.com/ (tilde)crywalt/pregnancy.contents.htm),
admitted that he did not find Tuesday morning's live birth ``too
thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could just be bitter,'' joked Rywalt.
</P>
<P>
   He had arranged to show his wife's delivery over the Web, but
the hospital pulled the plug at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural outcome of the Web site. It was in
conjunction with the book and so those who were following it could
join in,'' said Rywalt. ``We wanted to do it because it was a fun
thing to do. The tradition on the Internet is that people say,
`This is fun, let's do it because we can.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Werbach, managing editor of ``Release 1.0,'' a monthly
newsletter that discusses trends in the computer industry, said
that the amazing factor of the Internet is that it allows
information and events such as a live birth to be broadcast, an
event that the original creators of the Internet most likely never
imagined or expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is the Internet allows everybody to be a
publisher. It lets people who would not have access to the media to
get the word out,'' said Werbach. ``It makes it possible to
distribute information, although information on childbirth may be
stretching it.''

 c.1997 Consumers Digest
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From Diversion magazine. c.1996 Abby Tannenbaum 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZA LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

 &UR; By JENNIFER CRICHTON &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

   Dana Phelps-Marschalk has found a simple way to be considered a
culinary genius.
</P>
<P>
   When there's company at her home for dinner, an organizational
meeting of her dance troupe or a gathering of the girlfriends to
trade clothes and gossip, Phelps-Marschalk provides the no-fail
crowd pleaser: cobbler.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so funny. Cobbler is probably the easiest thing in the
world to make. A real no-brainer,'' said Phelps-Marschalk. ``But
when you play around with different fruits and combinations, people
think it's miraculous. They just go on and on like nobody else can
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cobblers that feature such fruits as mangoes and raspberries and
kiwis and pears have earned her the title ``cobbler queen'' among
some of her friends.
</P>
<P>
   And now is the sweetest time of the year to strut her stuff. The
basic combination of fruit and dough, perhaps topped with ice cream
or heavy cream, just sings summer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as with anything so dearly loved in the South, what
we call these fruit-and-dough delights depends on whom you are
asking. But usually, a cobbler is fruit, baked with a crust on top,
whether it's biscuit dough, pie dough or dough crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   A crisp is fruit topped with a crumbly mixture of butter, sugar,
flour and, sometimes, nuts. Other crisp toppings include oatmeal,
buttered bread crumbs, cookie crumbs, graham cracker crumbs and
cake crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the variations begin to blossom. A brown betty is
similar to a crisp but with layers of crumbs rather than just a
topping. A grunt or slump resembles a cobbler but is steamed on top
of the stove rather than baked, and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Such fruit desserts have been around a long time. Theories in
food-history circles suggest that because they are simple, cobblers
and similar fruit desserts were handed down orally for years before
they were ever recorded.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest written references comes from the 1839
cookbook ``The Kentucky Housewife,'' wherein Lettice Bryan writes
of a peach potpie, writing, ``although it is not a fashionable pie
for company, it is very excellent for family use, with cold sweet
milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Phelps-Marschalk and many other home cooks would agree
that cobbler is fine for family but would beg to differ on the idea
of not serving it to company. After all, in this do-it-fast age,
anything so pure and tasty and quick to fix is fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   And all you need is one good recipe. Phelps-Marschalk, an
Augusta native, borrowed her mother's, which came from a local
Master's Tournament cookbook. It was a classic peach cobbler
recipe, and for the most part, she simply varies the two cups of
fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only fruit I've tried that absolutely did not work was
</P>
<P>
   oranges,'' Phelps-Marschalk said.
</P>
<P>
   Experience has taught her to make some modifications now and
then. The sweeter the fruit, the less sugar she adds to it. If the
fruit is very sweet or has a distinctive flavor, such as mangoes,
she'll cut the sugar in the dough as well.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, the occasion calls for the classic. ``I've never
combined anything with peaches. It's just so good in its purest
form,'' she said. ``The epitome of the Southern dessert.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added, ``Of course, my favorite time to eat it is for
breakfast.''

CRIMINAL PROBE OF DA'S OFFICE UNDER WAY, U.S. SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Seeking to keep a 73-page document secret,
federal prosecutors have acknowledged that a grand jury is
investigating allegations of criminal activity involving a South
Texas district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors want the document to remain sealed because they
say it contains information about confidential sources, secretly
recorded telephone conversations and names of witnesses who are
cooperating with the government probe, Assistant U.S. Attorney Don
DeGabrielle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a substantial probability that the government's
investigation would be irreparably harmed if the sealed documents
were released,'' DeGabrielle said.
</P>
<P>
   He made the argument in a brief filed Tuesday with U.S. District
Judge John Rainey, who sealed the documents late last month after
issuing search warrants that FBI and Internal Revenue Service
agents used in a series of raids here.
</P>
<P>
   Should the information be made public, prosecutors fear evidence
would be destroyed, people would tailor their testimony and
witnesses would risk being harassed, DeGabrielle told the judge.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is substantial concern that disclosure of information
sources will deter future witnesses from coming forward with
information if they fear publicity or being exposed to harassment,
threats, intimidation, or worse by criminal suspects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The sealed document _ a 72-page affidavit for a search warrant _
describes why federal agents believed they would find evidence of
criminal wrongdoing involving Webb County District Attorney Joe
Rubio and others.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not said why the office is under
investigation. No arrests have been made in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit was reviewed by Rainey before he signed a series
of search warrants enabling federal agents to search Rubio's
office, his father's home and several other Laredo locations.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio ``Chito'' Davila, an attorney hired to represent Rubio,
said his client had done nothing wrong and that he hoped
prosecutors would use as much energy to clear Rubio's name as they
have to carry out the probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be the appropriate, right and fair thing to do to
restore confidence,'' Davila said. ``Hopefully, that confidence can
be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Davila said he suspects the only reason the district attorney
has drawn into case was because he heads that office.
</P>
<P>
   A court document shows that at least 142 people, including
several members of Rubio's staff, are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department contends all information relating to the
search warrants should remain sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents carted more than 5,000 documents from Rubio's
office, including criminal case files, personal financial
statements and documents showing when and how decisions were made
to drop charges, offer plea bargains or enable first-time
defendants to avoid trial with pre-trial diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those documents were returned Monday as part of an
agreement between federal prosecutors and Rubio's office.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Recent bout of carping not my finest hour
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 21: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My daughter said I have gotten sharp-tongued and nasty and she
wonders what has happened to my erstwhile easy, tolerant
disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mush-mouthed,'' a friend called it. I don't think I have ever
been what people are prone to call ``sweet,'' a loathsome term, but
I confess to being unreasonably angry and critical the last few
days.
</P>
<P>
   First, a visitor at our beach house annoyed me by trying to take
any task I undertook out of my hands. ``I'll get that for you!''
she cried when I reached for a bag of garbage. ``No!'' I shouted.
``I'm as strong as you are and it's my house and my garbage!''
Crestfallen, she backed away, but she didn't stop getting in my way
when I started to pick up something. And when I lugged a stepladder
upstairs so we could scrub the ceiling fans, she almost broke her
neck trying to climb it ahead of me. ``I climb ladders,'' I said
icily. My daughter intervened. ``Mother, she's younger than we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   My impulse was to say, ``I may be old, but I'm not fat!'' Fat
people should stay off ladders, but in the end, the pleasingly
plump one and I shared the task. I wiped the smoky whiskers off the
fan blades, and she followed with soap and water.
</P>
<P>
   Later, there was a discussion of drivers for our trip home. I
hate being driven, and it was their idea that one of them would
drive my car and I would lounge in the back of my daughter's big
Land Rover, taking my ease and being pampered. I hated it. ``I'm a
good driver,'' I protested, ``and it's my car!''
</P>
<P>
   It was so tactless and rude, even I noticed it, and capitulated
and let the visitor drive my car. But I'll never be really grateful
for her services.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst evidence of my bad manners was at my
grandson's graduation. The seniors were beautiful in their caps and
gowns, the service was moving _ except for one thing. A pretty girl
was chewing gum the entire time. She looked like a billy goat
chomping away. So afterward as we met outside, guess who said,
``Honey, you shouldn't chew gum in public!'' She looked stricken,
and my daughter tells me I ruined the day for her. I ask the Lord
to forgive me for that.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's what I did to my kind, always helpful
son-in-law. I asked him where something I needed was and he said,
``I have no idea!'' I have an unreasoning aversion to that answer,
but I could have let it go. Instead, I gave him an uncalled-for
lecture. ``To say, `I have no idea!' instead of `I'm sorry, I don't
know,' suggests that you are glad you don't know,'' I told him in a
tediously teacherlike voice. He smiled and prepared to leave. I
wouldn't let him go. I suggested that his children should be taught
to say, ``I'm sorry, I don't know,'' instead of the arrogant
sounding ``I have no idea.'' He nodded equably and made his
getaway.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter tells me he paid no attention and doesn't remember,
and I'm glad. I mention it to warn anybody who is in danger of
becoming carping and critical that it's no fun. I'm back to being
sugar-mouthed ... if possible.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some dark, sinister reason I'm furious at
well-meaning efforts to take care of me. A lot of people are
grateful when somebody offers to drive them. They don't look on it
as an indictment of their competence. I know women who can sit
still when guests take over their kitchens. As for gum-chewing, who
made me Miss Manners for today's generation? I'm ashamed, and I
confess, hoping there's a lesson here for some other cranky old
broad.

 &HT;    Mini Views: Reviews of the latest movies out on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Spice World'' (PG) _ Keeping its target audience of preteen
girls firmly in mind, this is a bubble-gum movie _ snappy, colorful
and instantly disposable. Based on an ``idea'' by the Spice Girls
(an idea they apparently had while watching ``A Hard Day's
Night''), the movie purports to be a few days in their frenzied
lives. Concert performances, recording sessions, parties, girl
talk, etc. Breezily directed by Bob Spiers (of ``Fawlty Towers''
and ``Absolutely Fabulous''), the movie is what it is _ nothing for
cineastes or music hipsters to bother with, but well-tailored for
its adolescent audience. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Fallen'' (R) _ For his second feature, director Gregory
Hoblit goes from the diabolical human nature of ``Primal Fear'' to
the genuinely demonic. Denzel Washington plays a homicide detective
fresh off the execution of a serial killer. But soon enough,
copycat murders start to plague the city ... or could it be the
same killer? The movie doesn't keep us in suspense for long,
showing that the culprit is a demon that passes from human to human
with the ease of a touch. And that's a problem for the movie: How
do you keep our interest in an invisible, nearly invincible force
of evil? The movie spins its wheels entertainingly enough, as
Washington researches the nature of devils. He's aided by Donald
Sutherland and John Goodman in supporting roles. But the movie
works itself into a corner from which there's only one escape: a
feel-bad, ``surprise'' ending. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Switchback'' (R) _ Obsessed FBI agent Dennis Quaid, affable
retired railroader Danny Glover, and hitchhiking former med student
Jared Leto _ any one of them could be a vicious serial killer.
Alas, after a character-driven unconventional start, this
suspense-thriller from the screenwriter of ``Die Hard'' and ``The
Fugitive'' lapses into an action-driven too-conventional finale.
Grade: B -

 &HT;    Queen reigns without force
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before ``Living Single'' and ``Set It Off,'' Queen
Latifah's music suggested she had versatility. After the
rapper/actress' ``All Hail the Queen'' in 1989 introduced her with
the insistence of ``Ladies First,'' she moved deftly into dance
(``Come Into My House'') and purposeful rap (``U.N.I.T.Y.'').
</P>
<P>
   She's never resided in one genre, and now it seems the Queen,
born Dana Owens, isn't one to adhere to titles either. On ``Order
in the Court'' she begins with the usual believable rap bravado on
``Bananas.'' But after that she turns to some pretty silky R&AMP;B and
barely memorable hooks made better by more singing than rhyming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn You On'' reworks vocalist Cherrelle's hit into a sharper
retort to a man who mistakes kindness as an invitation for romance.
``Parlay'' employs dreamy acid jazz. And ``Paper'' mines Marvin
Gaye's ``I Heard It Through the Grapevine'' for vocal style and
musical structure.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven singles pass between ``Bananas'' and the next
easy-to-recognize rap track, ``Brownsville.'' And though it's
certainly a pleasant musical journey, it's filler. And force is
what you expect from the Queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Order in the Court''
</P>
<P>
   Queen Latifah. Motown. 14 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: More R&AMP;B with rapper Queen Latifah up front. Her
voice and pen are still strong enough to prop up weak melodies.

 &HT;    A hipper side to `The X-Files'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soundtracks these days frequently are mere marketing tie-ins to
movies, hipper (and more profitable) alternatives to Burger King
commemorative cups. So the soundtrack to ``The X-Files: Fight the
Future,'' which opens Friday, has two songs out of 14 that appear
in the film: a cover of the Doors' ``Crystal Ship'' by the L.A.
post-punk band X and a reworking of the TV theme by the Dust
Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is a decent roundup of unreleased songs by the usual
alt-rockers: Tonic, Ween, Bjork, the Cardigans, Noel Gallagher (of
Oasis). Acts contributed songs without having seen the film, but
were trying to capture the series' blend of paranoia and the
paranormal (and mostly succeeding).
</P>
<P>
   The Foo Fighters' melodic ``Walking After You'' has a fittingly
ambiguous chorus line: ``I'm on your back.'' From one cop to
another (``X-Files'' is about FBI agents), this is reassuring; from
one lover to another, it's creepily claustrophobic.
</P>
<P>
   Filter contributes a primal screamin' cover of the Three Dog
Night oldie ``One'' that fits the show's sense of isolation
metaphorically, while Better Than Ezra's ``One More Murder'' works
more literally.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the shows should seek out the hidden spoken track, which
starts 10 minutes and 13 seconds after the last track ends (creator
Chris Carter's Tenthirteen production company is named for his Oct.
13 birthday). For the first time, Carter briefly outlines the
history of the conspiracy underpinning the show.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get confused _ there's also a score to the ``X-Files''
movie, which is instrumental music by Mark Snow and aimed at the
hard-core X-phile, not the 99X listener, as this one is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files: The Album''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Elektra. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Creepy alt-rock accompaniment to the new film.

 &HT;    Mini Views: Reviews of the latest movies out on video
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- ``Spice World'' (PG) _ Keeping its target audience of preteen
girls firmly in mind, this is a bubble-gum movie _ snappy, colorful
and instantly disposable. Based on an ``idea'' by the Spice Girls
(an idea they apparently had while watching ``A Hard Day's
Night''), the movie purports to be a few days in their frenzied
lives. Concert performances, recording sessions, parties, girl
talk, etc. Breezily directed by Bob Spiers (of ``Fawlty Towers''
and ``Absolutely Fabulous''), the movie is what it is _ nothing for
cineastes or music hipsters to bother with, but well-tailored for
its adolescent audience. Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Fallen'' (R) _ For his second feature, director Gregory
Hoblit goes from the diabolical human nature of ``Primal Fear'' to
the genuinely demonic. Denzel Washington plays a homicide detective
fresh off the execution of a serial killer. But soon enough,
copycat murders start to plague the city ... or could it be the
same killer? The movie doesn't keep us in suspense for long,
showing that the culprit is a demon that passes from human to human
with the ease of a touch. And that's a problem for the movie: How
do you keep our interest in an invisible, nearly invincible force
of evil? The movie spins its wheels entertainingly enough, as
Washington researches the nature of devils. He's aided by Donald
Sutherland and John Goodman in supporting roles. But the movie
works itself into a corner from which there's only one escape: a
feel-bad, ``surprise'' ending. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   -- ``Switchback'' (R) _ Obsessed FBI agent Dennis Quaid, affable
retired railroader Danny Glover, and hitchhiking former med student
Jared Leto _ any one of them could be a vicious serial killer.
Alas, after a character-driven unconventional start, this
suspense-thriller from the screenwriter of ``Die Hard'' and ``The
Fugitive'' lapses into an action-driven too-conventional finale.
Grade: B -

 &HT;    Tubes are tops once again
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 21: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's one summer trend that could very well go bust.
</P>
<P>
   Few looks are viewed as skeptically by women as tube tops.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that most major designers included body-hugging
bandeauxs in their summer collections, or that stores ranging from
Sears to Saks Fifth Avenue are peddling them.
</P>
<P>
   Many women don't think they're fit enough to wear tube tops, and
they look critically at the women who do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Lord,'' said Atlantan Kendra Taylor, 25. ``Those things
should be banned! They're fine if you've got the right body for
them, like that (veejay) Ananda on MTV who wears them a lot.
Unfortunately, most of the women I've seen in them don't seem to
realize that they do make foundation garments you can wear under
those things. Without the proper support, your chest just hangs out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, today's tube tops look less _ um _ cheap than they did
during '70s, thanks to superior stretch fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Allard, design director for the Ellen Tracy label favored
by corporate climbers, had to weigh the pros and cons before making
modest, mature-looking tube tops the basis of her summer
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little daring and not so easy to wear,'' she admitted.
``But so many women today are in such good shape. They think, `If
I've got it, I should flaunt it.'''

 &HT;    Audio mini reviews: The latest word on current sounds
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault, Doug Hamilton, Al Levine, Miriam Longino, Sonia
Murray, and Nick Tate
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   -- URBAN
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Dolittle''
</P>
<P>
   Various artists. Atlantic. 15 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dr. Dolittle'' soundtrack does a lot to interest R&AMP;B and
rap listeners. If you like your tempo slow, Changing Faces wraps
its fine vocals around a lesser ballad (``Do Little Thing''). The
69 Boyz' party/sports anthem ``Woof Woof'' takes things up to
roof-raising proportions and former En Vogue member Dawn Robinson
takes on, respectfully, Aretha Franklin's ``Rock Steady.'' But what
``Dolittle'' does best is highlight producer-artist Timbaland's
inventive way with a track. He crafts four of the better songs here
and makes the lead single by Aaliyah, ``Are You That Somebody,''
practically irresistible with a sample of a baby's giggle.
</P>
<P>
   -- COUNTRY
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody Love,
</P>
<P>
   Nobody Gets Hurt''
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Bogguss. Capitol. 11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   How many comebacks does one artist get? Where Suzy Bogguss is
concerned, the answer is: how ever many she wants. She's made only
two original albums since 1993. Motherhood became a priority. But
Bogguss is back, better than ever. She's definitely the queen of
cerebral country, with songs like the title track about a
poor-spelling, would-be robber with a Freudian slip. She rocks
(``From Where I Stand''), she muses (``Train of Thought''), she
dishes out the advice (``Somebody to Love'') and makes you want to
say: Don't stay away so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``How I Feel''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Clark. Mercury. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Terri Clark may have begun with gimmicks in her big
I'm-one-of-the-boys hat and tight jeans, but her third CD proves
more than calculated marketing. Canadian Clark has a country voice
as pure and unaffected as rain on a tin roof and she's kept the
production on this album as simple as a gutter spout. No annoying
electric lounge piano, no pop arrangements. These tunes are draped
in musical cotton: simple acoustic guitar, fiddles, mandolin and
pedal steel. Clark's cover of Kim Richey's ``I'm Alright'' is as
good as the spunky original. The title tune, a cover of a song
originally intended for an R&AMP;B audience, fits Clark's twang with
ease.
</P>
<P>
   -- COUNTRY-ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Blackjack David''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Alvin. Hightone Records.
</P>
<P>
   11 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Since the breakup in 1985 of his great roots-rock band, the
Blasters, Dave Alvin has released a string of solo albums that
never quite captured the audience they deserved. While Dwight
Yoakam and X have scored with covers of his songs, Alvin's own
efforts have been ghettoized on low-watt Americana radio stations.
``Blackjack David'' probably won't make him a household name,
either. While chock full of evocative country-folk melodies and
polished playing, it's decidedly unflashy _ a big no-no in this
glitzy era of Shania Twain and Garth Brooks. Guess Alvin will have
to be content with the ability to write near-perfect gems like
``California Snow.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Lynyrd Skynyrd Lyve From Steeltown''
</P>
<P>
   Lynyrd Skynyrd. CMC International.15 tracks (2 CDs).
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   This plodding effort is about what you'd expect from the latest
Skynyrd lineup: Another live hits package with new concert versions
of the old tunes that sound a lot like the old versions. No
surprises here. And few sparks. Ten of the 15 tracks were on LS's
two previous, superior live albums: 1976's ``One More From the
Road'' (recorded at the Fox Theatre) and '87's ``Southern by the
Grace of God.'' Even on the new tunes, the good old boys of
Southern rock sound like they've abandoned their Rebel yell style
and are just going through the motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premonition''
</P>
<P>
   John Fogerty. Reprise. 18 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Far superior to any previous best-of and live albums, this
live-in-the-studio set is all anyone could ask of John Fogerty,
a.k.a. Creedence Clearwater Revival. It's got fiery guitar work,
rock-solid beats and Fogerty's distinctively strangulated
swamp-rock vocals. All that's wrapped around 18 tracks, including
``Fortunate Son,'' ``Proud Mary'' and other great CCR tunes, along
with ``Centerfield'' and other merely good songs from his solo
career.

 &HT;    Bonham Carter flies high in `Dove'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Wings of the Dove'' (R)
</P>
<P>
   After a few too stately Henry James adaptations (``Portrait of a
Lady,'' say), Iain Softley's film dusts off the literary cobwebs
and gets to the driving forces of most any story: power, money,
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Helena Bonham Carter (in an Oscar-nominated performance) plays
Kate Croy, a penniless woman in Edwardian London, who is taken
under the diamond-dripping wings of her aunt (Charlotte Rampling).
The problem is, the man Kate loves _ journalist Merton Densher
(Linus Roache) _ is exactly the sort of low-income fellow her aunt
refuses to let her marry.
</P>
<P>
   So, while Kate vacillates between dull parties for the wealthy
and secret trysts with Merton, she makes a new friend. And hits on
a scheme. The new friend is fabulously wealthy Millie Theale
(Alison Elliott), an American who also happens to be terminally
ill. The scheme? Well, think about it ...
</P>
<P>
   Shot largely in the mournful beauty of Venice, ``Wings'' charts
the unexpected ways the heart can trip up any plan. Elliott is the
weak link of the acting trio; she's not bad, it's just very hard to
pull off an aura of goodness. But Bonham Carter (once little more
than a pretty face, now a real actor) is exquisite to watch her
Kate become not only the agent but the victim of her own scheming.
Grade: A -

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will cover much of the central portion of the
nation Thursday as a strong disturbance in the jet stream passes
through the region. A fast flow of humid air from the south rising
up and over a warm front will cause heavy showers and embedded
thunderstorms from the eastern Dakotas to the upper Mississippi
Valley. A protracted period of heavy rain may result in local
flooding, particularly in Iowa and northern Illinois. Additional
showers will also occur in the western Dakotas as moist air
circulates around low pressure near the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   As the jet stream disturbance intercepts an unusually sultry air
mass, scattered severe thunderstorms will erupt from the Red River
Valley to the middle Mississippi Valley. Winds shifting direction
and increasing with altitude will induce a few of these
thunderstorms to rotate. These rotating storms, known as
supercells, are capable of producing tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and scattered showers will affect northern New England as
low pressure advances northeast through the Saint Lawrence Valley.
Meanwhile, ample sunshine will cover the remainder of the Northeast
and Middle Atlantic states. Farther south, strong high pressure
will promote dry and hot conditions from south Texas to the Florida
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   A pool of unusually cool air will drift south into the Pacific
Northwest, bringing low clouds and chilly conditions to western
sections of Washington and Oregon. Elsewhere, ample sunshine and
seasonable conditions will cover California and the Southwestern
states.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Florida Heat
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the temperature soared to a record 101 degrees at
Daytona Beach, Fla. This marked the 9th day this June that the city
tied or broke a record high temperature and the 7th day this month
that the city reached the century mark. While sultry air is common
in Florida this time of the year, such extreme heat is rare.
Typically, the difference in daytime heating between the peninsula
and nearby Atlantic Ocean induces cooling sea breezes. Circulation
around high pressure over the Gulf of Mexico has caused persistent
winds from the west which have kept cooling sea breezes at bay
along the Florida's northeast coast.

   In 1944, the future founders of the Farnsworth Art Museum's
collection in Rockland, Maine, bought four watercolors by an
emerging artist. His name was Andrew Wyeth. On Sunday, in
connection with its 50th anniversary, the museum, with some 4,500
works of art and objects made by the Wyeths, will open the
Farnsworth Center for the Wyeth Family in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Comprising exhibition space and a study center in a new
building, the center is devoted to works created in and about Maine
by three generations of the artistic family: N.C. Wyeth
(1882-1945), his son Andrew Wyeth (born 1917) and Andrew's son
Jamie Wyeth (born 1946). The inaugural exhibition, ``Wondrous
Strange,'' includes more than 100 works and examines the influence
of the illustrator Howard Pyle, N.C. Wyeth's teacher.

at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering, formally Clearwater's Great Hudson River Revival,
will offer more than 50 performers of folk, jazz, blues and other
music between 10 a.m. and dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scheduled entertainers, some of whom will appear only

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

as soon as we finish dancing,'' Richardson says.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson grew up going to Friday-night fish fries at her
grandmother's house and to family picnics, where she looked around
and saw ``walking statistics: heart attacks and strokes waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul food is really unhealthy,'' she says. ``My mother is a
great cook, but her favorite foods are fried fish, macaroni and
cheese, and beans cooked with bacon fat.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 35, is determined to help prevent heart disease
through physical fitness and good nutrition _ not only in her own
family, but also among African-American women and the inner-city
kids she meets through her work with the Boys &AMP; Girls clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The heart disease death rate for black females is 222.6 per
100,000 _ 69 percent higher than for white females. For stroke, the
death rate is 39.9 per 100,000 black females, 75.8 percent higher
than for white females, according to the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Black women smoke more, have more high blood pressure, more high
cholesterol, more obesity and more diabetes _ and they are less
active.
</P>
<P>
   They are more likely to live in neighborhoods where the majority
of families are headed by women, and their health is consequently
more likely to be compromised by family and social obligations,
according to a study to be released this month in the ``Journal of
Health and Social Behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a physical fitness celebrity with nine workout
videos and a new book, ``Let's Get Real: Exercise Your Right to a
Healthy Body'' (Pocket Books, $16) was in Fort Worth and Dallas
recently to offer fitness tips and advice as part of a national
celebration of Women's Wellness.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson originally wanted to become an actress and dancer,
and there was a time, she says, when she was concerned that
aerobics would interfere with her career. As it turned out,
aerobics became her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history of heart disease in my family, and the
turnaround in lifestyles to help control that has taken years,''
she says. ``My dad has had two strokes. My grandmother died of a
heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother, bless her heart, has always been so busy taking
care of everybody else, she didn't take any time for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother held two jobs and volunteered extensively in her
neighborhood and church. She dieted frequently and often ate late
at night, when she was too exhausted to cook properly. She got very
little exercise. When she retired, she was overweight, had high
blood pressure and was suffering from low self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who was traveling around the world promoting good
health, got her mom back on her old exercise bike, which was
gathering dust. She encouraged her mom to start dancing again (she
had always loved to dance), taught her some new muscle-building
exercises and stretches, and started calling often to encourage
her.
</P>
<P>
   She also recommended eating smaller meals more often throughout
the day; getting more fiber from vegetables and whole-grain foods;
opting for low-fat alternatives to regular salad dressings,
margarine and snack foods; and grilling, broiling or baking instead
of frying.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother lost 35 pounds in nine months and now leads an
exercise class at her church.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women tend to focus on others' needs _ their husband's,
children's, parents' _ and they are in denial. They think they
won't get heart disease,'' says Dr. Louis Dickey, senior medical
director for Aetna U.S. Healthcare. ``Wives and mothers defer their
own health-care needs because they are busy caring for their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is also a problem of heart disease presenting
differently in women. A woman may experience weakness and
dizziness, as opposed to a crushing pressure in her chest. She may
not recognize her symptoms as cardiovascular disease,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women show up later with symptoms, and their risk of dying is
greater. They also get less aggressive care: less heart
catheterization, later surgery, less clot-buster drugs. Women think
they are not at risk, and to some extent, doctors make the same
mistake, especially with younger women.''
</P>
<P>
   Prevention is the key. Richardson and Dickey say everyone has
time to exercise. ``Fitness is hard, because we often don't see an
immediate payoff,'' Dickey says. ``You need to look at it as an
investment in the future _ like your 401(k).''

BRIAN WILSON IS BACK, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: For use Sunday, June 21, and thereafter.) 
(th) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CHARLES, Ill. _ What street do you live on in West
Hollywood?'' Brian Wilson asks.
</P>
<P>
   I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be darned; I used to live on that same street,'' he says
excitedly, referring to a period more than 30 years ago. ``In an
apartment? What's your address?''
</P>
<P>
   I tell him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I was at 1047 North. Near, not Clinton, Santa Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife of three years, Melinda, chimes in: ``See, people never
think he remembers his past. We've had so many lawsuits, and these
attorneys come in thinking he probably won't remember anything, and
he just blows them away. What was your batting average in high
school, Brian?''
</P>
<P>
   ``About .169,'' Wilson blurts.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wilson is back. That is, he's back again. Brian Wilson has
been back a lot over the last two decades, and every time, it is
hailed as a return to form after years of mental instability.
</P>
<P>
   There is a myth engulfing Brian Wilson, and it is something he
will have to deal with in marketing campaigns for the rest of his
life. Myths aren't necessarily fabricated stories; they're just
extraordinary tales representative of larger societal themes and
trends. Wilson's is a tale of a genius gone mad, locked inside the
prison of his own mind. It begins in an age of many myths _ the
'60s _ and it goes something like this:
</P>
<P>
   One sunny day in California, Brian Wilson, his brothers and some
friends decided to make sunny California pop about surfing, cars
and girls. But Brian Wilson wasn't happy just making pop about
surfing, cars and girls.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted more, and eventually he found it, making a pop
masterpiece, ``Pet Sounds,'' and leaving unfinished an even more
ambitious one, a pop-music equivalent of Mozart's Requiem called
``Smile.'' During this musically heroic journey, he suffered a
nervous breakdown and soon retired to his bed, where he spent years
in isolation. And that's where our story begins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Wilson was back with a new Beach Boys album; then he
was back in 1983 as a touring member of the Beach Boys, and then he
was back in 1988 with a solo album produced with his then-therapist
Eugene Landy. And throughout the '90s he has been back with
increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, he has recorded new versions of his old
songs for a Don Was documentary about him, ``I Just Wasn't Made for
These Times''; reunited with Carnie and Wendy, his estranged
daughters from a previous marriage, to help with their album ``The
Wilsons''; teamed up with his ``Smile'' songwriting partner, Van
Dyke Parks for, the record ``Orange Crate Art,'' and last week
released the latest and best of these albums, ``Imagination,'' with
the producer Joe Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Wilson returns, he is heralded by a new Brian-is-back
marketing campaign and propped up by a collaborator who may or may
not have his best interests at heart. (He is currently, for
example, settling a lawsuit with Landy for the return of his
songwriting royalties.)
</P>
<P>
   In the rare glimpses the public gets of him every time he
returns, Wilson looks and sounds better. In the 1994 documentary
``Theremin,'' Wilson spends several minutes trying to stammer a
single phrase. Just a year later, in the Don Was documentary, he is
more communicative but still clearly struggling with himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought once in a while my face had a twist of emotional
pain coming out of it, but not too obvious,'' Wilson jokes about
the documentary now.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks to a new doctor, new medication and a new family,
Wilson seems like a gentle 55-year-old, more innocent than
disturbed. In conversation, sitting in shorts and a T-shirt in his
new home studio in St. Charles, a Chicago suburb (his main
residence, of course, being in California), he comes in and out of
focus.
</P>
<P>
   When he is engaged, he is perceptive, sincere and very funny. He
tells a story about the only time he spanked his pudgy daughter,
Carnie: she made two peanut butter sandwiches when he told her she
was only allowed to have one. When Wilson isn't engaged, he's
quiet, absent-minded and dreamy. At one point, he stops midthought
and asks that his comment be stricken from the record because he
forgot he was being interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the losses Wilson has suffered lately, his
improvement is remarkable. ``Brian and I, we had a tough year last
year,'' his wife said. ``In four months, I lost my dad and he lost
his mother and his brother.'' Since the death of Wilson's brother
Carl (who died of cancer this year), Wilson is now without parents
and the brothers he formed the band with.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans have attributed Wilson's breakdowns, nervousness and
reclusiveness to his drug use in the mid-'60s, but Wilson and his
wife both said that they felt the problems were more deeply rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about his father, who was also his manager, Brian
Wilson said: ``He fouled my brain up. I went out in life scared as
hell. Everybody that I looked at was my dad looking back at me. He
beat me up, you know. It was as traumatic as hell. I really went
through a bad, bad, bad childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's family today works as a better support system. He met
Melinda, a former used-car saleswoman, at an event she describes as
choreographed by Landy. He took Wilson to buy what Mrs. Wilson
recalls as ``an ugly brown car,'' and then Landy asked her out on a
date with Wilson. The meeting turned out better than expected; the
two married and now live with two adopted daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian's improvement today compared to when I met him four
years ago has doubled,'' said his producer, Thomas, who lives next
door to the Wilsons in St. Charles. ``He's more at peace with
himself, he's way more focused than he was early on, and building a
good relationship with Melinda and the kids has really allowed him
to concentrate on being a whole person rather than just this genius
locked-away musician guy. The fact that he got on stage after so
long was in itself an achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month at the Cultural Arts Center in St. Charles, Wilson
performed what was promoted as his first solo concert. More a
taping for VH1 than a concert, Wilson harmonized with backup
recordings on new solo songs and Beach Boys classics and sat in
front of a fake piano, pretending to play as a string section and
as many as nine other musicians (including his Beach Boys
replacement, Bruce Johnston) accompanied him.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Wilson was silent and nervous. But several songs into
the show, Thomas whispered something in his ear and Wilson came to
life, talking with the crowd and singing less reticently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `They really like you, you know,''' Thomas
recalled. ``And he goes, `You know, Joe, they really do.' I said,
`So what are you scared of?' And he goes, `Nothing.'''

 ST. CHARLES, Ill.: he goes, `Nothing.''' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilson's new album, ``Imagination'' (Giant), is being marketed
as a ``rebirth'' of the ``Pet Sounds'' era. It is not the first
time, nor will it be the last, that such a claim is made for
Wilson's later work. It is the logical next stage in the myth of
Brian Wilson: the hero's return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect it to be a huge commercial success both here and
abroad,'' said Irving Azoff, who runs Giant Records. ``I think it's
deserving as a candidate to be the best comeback ever in the music
business. And I'm going to do everything I can with this company to
make sure it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Imagination'' is no ``Pet Sounds.'' Even Wilson
knows that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never do another `Pet Sounds,''' he said. ``But the
love I put into it. I used that same love and put it into my album
now. It came right out of my heart. This new one, I hope they like
it better than `Pet Sounds' even.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Wilson interrupts him: ``But you have to remember, honey,
when you first made `Pet Sounds,' nobody really liked it.''
</P>
<P>
   What ``Imagination'' sounds like is a very good Brian Wilson
solo album, breathtaking in places and weak in others. Full of
rich, layered harmonies, addictively sweet choruses and emotions
that alternate between the purity of a young child's and the
complexity of a man putting together the pieces of a shattered
life.
</P>
<P>
   In most songs, Wilson is happy when bathed in sunshine or smiles
and sad when people cry or leave him. But at moments, he looks back
at his current state with razor precision, as in the dissonant
dirge ``Happy Days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh God, the pain I've been going through,'' he begins the
song; in the middle, he repeats a lament he must have heard about
himself hundreds of times, ``When he was ... ''; and in the end, he
declares, ``Goodbye, blues, happy days are here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Listening to this slickly produced, almost adult contemporary
pop album, one might wonder how much of the music Brian Wilson is
responsible for and how much of it is a result of the prodding of
his producer, Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Mertens, who played saxophone on some of the songs,
described the recording process thusly: ``Joe was guiding the
process but always deferred to what Brian wanted to do. They seemed
to have a very good recording relationship. As we were listening to
a playback of `Lay Down Burden,' Brian was humming something to
himself and Joe noticed and said, `Do you have an idea?' Then he
had Brian go immediately to the microphone and sing the melody that
was going though his head along with the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who met Wilson when he produced a country music Beach
Boys tribute album in 1996, said that at first he felt as if he
were being tested by Wilson. Sometimes Wilson would come to a
recording session, say that ``the vibe isn't right today to work''
and then wait to see if Thomas would let him take the day off,
which, unlike Wilson's father, he always did.
</P>
<P>
   For a follow-up, Wilson hopes to record a rock-and-roll album.
He doubts, however, that he will perform with the Beach Boys now
that Carl is gone, though he may consider recording with them if he
and his cousin, Mike Love, the only remaining original Beach Boy,
can get along. Either way, pop-music fans can take heart: Brian
Wilson will be back again and again and again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can really sing,'' Mertens said, recalling listening
to the music in the studio. ``I got emotional when I heard the
playback for the first time: here was a guy sitting at the console
that looked really tired and really out of it. And then to hear
this incredible singing coming out, it blew me away. It made me
realize there's still this musical jewel inside him.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta ad man writes book about his dad that everyone can use
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Vincent Staniforth began writing a book about his father,
he didn't pretend to have all the answers. He just had the
questions. What began as therapy for the Atlanta advertising
executive after the death of his father in 1990 became a blueprint
for men and women to learn about their own dads.
</P>
<P>
   ``These questions should have been asked when Dad was alive,''
says Staniforth, whose inspirational book, ``Questions for My
Father'' (Beyond Words, $15), has just been published. ``They
remained unasked for what seemed at the time valid reasons: lack of
time in some cases, lack of courage in others. I knew I was loved.
He knew I loved him. But there was so much more there. All that
time, all I ever had to do was ask the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions range from ``What's your biggest regret?'' to
``When I was born, what was your dream for me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Answering these questions,'' Staniforth says, ``you might come
to agree with the view that this book is more about self-discovery
than Dad-discovery. And I want to emphasize that these are my
questions. I urge you to develop your own questions. Sit down with
your children and answer the same questions.''
</P>
<P>
   -- SECOND ACT: When your first novel sells 3 million copies
after being featured on Oprah Winfrey's Book Club, what do you do
next?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question facing Jacquelyn Mitchard two years ago
when Winfrey made ``The Deep End of the Ocean'' a best seller and
Michele Pfeiffer bought the movie rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was curious to find out if I could write another novel, even
a bad one,'' says Mitchard, a syndicated newspaper columnist from
Madison, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for ``The Most Wanted'' (Viking, $24.95) came to her in
a dream about a 14-year-old Texas girl who falls in love with a
convict. As she began writing the story, other characters popped
up, including a 40-year-old lawyer named Annie Singer who is in an
empty relationship with a fellow attorney. The teenager finds
friendship and support with Annie, and Annie finds true love with a
young carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   Reviews have been mixed, but Mitchard doesn't care. In a case of
life imitating art, the 45-year-old journalist who lost her husband
to cancer six years ago has remarried. Her husband? Chris
Sornberger, a 32-year-old carpenter and landscaper who came to work
on her house after she had finished the novel. ``He's a lovely,
intuitive, generous man, and I think he's got the right stuff,''
says Mitchard, who has five children, ages 2 to 22. The couple
married in May, a day before Mitchard left on a publicity tour for
her new novel.

   -- RICH LIT: John Edgar Wideman has won the $30,000 Rea Award
for the Short Story. Sponsored annually by the Dungannon
Foundation, the annual award is not given for a specific title, but
for originality and influence on the genre. Wideman's story
collections include ``Damballah,'' ``Fever,'' ``The Stories of John
Edgar Wideman'' and ``All Stories Are True.'' Wideman, who lives in
Massachusetts, won the PEN/Faulkner Award in 1984 for ``Sent for
You Yesterday,'' and in 1990 for ``Philadelphia Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   -- FEAR AND LOATHING: Best-selling author R.L. Stine says his
new Fear Street Seniors series, which follows a class of teens
through their senior year in high school, is his scariest. Stine,
whose venture in adult fiction was not as successful as his
children's books, still pens one Goosebumps title each month.

 &HT;    ``Moneyline'' expansion part of CNN's block programming
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world, and not just the world of money, will soon be Lou
Dobbs' beat.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs' CNN financial news show ``Moneyline'' will expand to an
hour starting Monday, airing from 6:30-7:30 p.m. EDT, and will be
renamed ``The Moneyline News Hour With Lou Dobbs.'' The extra
half-hour comes out of CNN's ``WorldView'' newscast.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be more international news added,`` Dobbs said
Wednesday. ``The world's primary issues are fundamentally
economically rooted, and this is our acknowledgment of that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are doing is acknowledging a high degree of
interdependency among global economies, governments and important
news developments.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as he put it more simply: ``I can find an economic angle in
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   By way of example, Dobbs said the new expanded ``Moneyline''
might do a story on how the squabbling between independent counsel
Kennth Starr and the White House has affected the political climate
in Washington, D.C., and therefore legislation affecting the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs, who's more than an anchor (he's also president of CNNfn,
the financial news subsidiary cable network), said the expansion
will not mean more features or softer approaches on ``Moneyline,''
although part of the revamp will include a new set and new
graphics, also to be unveiled Monday. The show will also feature
more news on the economics of entertainment and sports, although
``Moneyline's'' traditional what-the-Dow-did-today approach will
not be abandoned.

<P>
   New York City, the club scene, mid-'80s. Weird, man. How weird?
These so-called Club Kids _ young, partying, fame-seeking hedonists
whose only talents were outsized amounts of self-promotion and
self-destruction _ became regulars on``Geraldo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a place for you if you are a freak. If you're a
hunchback, throw a little glitter on it,'' one Kid says of the
scene's attraction in ``Party Monster,'' the rivetingly grotesque
documentary that airs at midnight EDT tonight on Cinemax. The
media, naturally, ate them up; one observer called them ``stars for
no reason.'' Reason enough.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Alig was the biggest no-reason star of all. A gay kid
from smalltown Indiana, Alig fled to New York for his 15 minutes of
fame and wound up serving 10 to 20 for the bizarre murder of his
roommate. ``Party Monster,'' which first made waves at the Sundance
Film Festival, traces with a coolly intimate eye the steady,
drug-happy unwinding of Alig from gory ironist to gory killer.
</P>
<P>
   Alig and his flamboyantly misfit crew were so self-absorbed they
seemed to video tape and record their almost every move, giving
``Party Monster'' an eerie, home-movie air of macabre inevitability
(there's no narrator, and some scenes are recreated with
appropriately dreamlike chaos). So when a fellow Club Kid recounts
the depths of Alig's awfulness and then giggles to an unseen
interviewer, ``Did I just destroy the whole point of your
documentary?'' he doesn't realize that he's only enhanced it. This
is one troubling trip into a glittery heart of darkness.

NEW LAWS COULD SHORTCHANGE PRUDENTIAL POLICYHOLDERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Mass.)   (dc) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With billions of dollars at stake and after little debate, New
Jersey lawmakers are poised to adopt legislation governing the
reorganization of Prudential Insurance Co. of America that consumer
advocates say contains troubling loopholes that could shortchange
nearly 11 million policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which was drafted by Prudential in meetings
with state regulators and comes up for a vote Thursday in the state
Assembly, provides a framework for distributing stock to the
policyholders as Prudential shifts from a mutual insurer, nominally
owned by its customers, to a publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer advocates have praised Prudential, based in Newark,
N.J., for deciding to reorganize in a way that compensates
policyholders rather than giving them nothing, as some of the
largest insurers based in New York are proposing. But they are
concerned that Prudential's pledges are not detailed in the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how to determine each policyholder's share of the
company's worth. Traditionally, when insurers have switched to
public ownership they have used their accumulated profits as a
starting point in that calculation. In Prudential's case, that is
$20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential says that it is unclear what dollar amount will be
used as the benchmark but that it is committed to giving
policyholders stock worth the full value of the company, an amount
that will be determined by actuaries. The consumer advocates say,
however, that loopholes and exemptions in the pending measure could
reduce the amount of stock that policyholders receive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying, `Trust us,''' said Jason Adkins, founder of
the Center for Insurance Research in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Such concerns are misplaced, Prudential executives and state
lawmakers respond, noting that the legislation requires that the
distribution of stock be ``fair and equitable'' and that the entire
plan for the company ultimately be approved by the state insurance
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``If in fact the concerns of the consumer advocates are
legitimate,'' said Richard Codey, the state Senate's minority
leader and a co-sponsor of the bill, ``then you have the
commissioner of insurance as the safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics say their qualms are justified because of
Prudential's recent troubled past and history of close ties to
state officials.
</P>
<P>
   The company's reputation has taken a pounding for most of the
decade as customers complained of repeated deception in the sale of
securities and insurance policies. Prudential's securities unit
paid $1.5 billion in fines, compensation and legal costs after
customers of risky limited partnerships suffered heavy losses. The
company is also expected to pay up to $2 billion to settle a
class-action suit by customers who said they were misled about the
cost of their life insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, New Jersey insurance regulators have been
criticized for showing leniency toward the company, one of the
state's biggest employers. In the life insurance case, Florida and
other states were far more critical of Prudential and negotiated
millions more in penalties and compensation from the company.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Prudential has had a close relationship with the
state's political leadership. Several former governors and other
political leaders have served on the board, including Raymond
Bateman, a longtime legislator and the father of Christopher
Bateman, the current chairman of the state assembly committee on
banking and insurance. Gov. Christie Whitman's husband, John, was a
senior manager for a Prudential subsidiary from 1987 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Randall, the New Jersey commissioner of banking and
insurance, sees no problems with the pending legislation. In a
letter to Christopher Bateman, a co-sponsor of the Prudential
legislation, Ms. Randall said the ``bill appropriately protects and
preserves the interest of policyholders.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which was swiftly endorsed by both assembly and
Senate committees earlier this month, gives broad latitude to
Prudential in determining the company's value and how much each
policyholder should get. It also places no limits on how much stock
could be set aside for executives and other employees, permits
Prudential to keep secret some aspects of the reorganization and
exempts the insurer from a public hearing in which critics could
cross-examine witnesses and demand documents to determine whether
the process is fair.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential and legislative sponsors say none of this should
concern the company's customers. ``This is a terrific bill for
policyholders,'' said Mark Grier, the company's highest-ranking
financial officer and the executive in charge of the
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, to be voted on in the Senate later this month,
was designed as a guide, Grier said, and not as a detailed plan.
And nothing in it diminishes ``our intention to provide the full
value of the company to our policyholders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives and state legislators have ignored appeals
for more specific consumer protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're committed to doing this fairly, why not put it in
the bill?'' asked one critic, Anthony Wright, who is following the
legislation for New Jersey Citizenaction, the state's largest
consumer watchdog group. ``Why not give policyholders guarantees in
writing?''
</P>
<P>
   Prudential has its headquarters in the district represented by
Codey, the minority leader. ``The company needs a shot in the arm
and obviously this should be it,'' he said. ``And hopefully the
policyholders are taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Prudential is still feeling the effects from its legal problems.
Sales of its signature product, life insurance, have fallen from a
peak of 1 million policies in 1991 to fewer than 300,000 last year.
Profits in 1997 were off 43.3 percent, to $610 million, from the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   Even before publicly announcing plans to reorganize in February,
legislators say, Prudential began lining up bipartisan support in
both houses of the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The company and the legislative sponsors proudly refer to the
bill as one of the most consumer-friendly measures of its type. But
the standard set in other states is not very high.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Prudential legislation would be the first to
require a minimum number of policyholders to approve a
reorganization: at least 1 million, or about 9 percent of
Prudential's total, must vote, with at least two-thirds in favor.
But the number can be less than 1 million if the insurance
commissioner approves.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to determining the value of the company, there is
no mention in the bill of accumulated profits or other financial
assets that historically have been used by mutual insurers in
determining their value and the allocations to policyholders,
leaving Prudential to develop its own criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer advocates say language in the bill that allocates
100 percent of the reorganized company's common stock to
policyholders leaves open the possibility that other kinds of stock
could be created, reducing the amount available to holders. This
ambiguity could be remedied, they say, by specifying that 100
percent of the common stock represents the company's full value.
But Grier said, ``Our interpretation is that this means 100 percent
of the value.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the legislation empowers the insurance commissioner
to authorize the sale of additional stock if Prudential
demonstrates ``a need for additional capital'' or that a sale
``would not significantly dilute'' the value of policyholders'
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, `What is significant?''' asked Wright of
Citizenaction.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation prohibits any members of Prudential's board,
including Arthur Ryan, the chief executive, from receiving stock
when the reorganization takes place. But stock can be given to
other executives and employees without limit.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Jersey's right-to-know law, Wright said, all the
documents in Prudential's reorganization would have been available
to the public. But the legislation creates an exception that
enables Prudential to keep its business plan, financial projections
and other information secret, including the details of how the
value of the company is to be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins of the Center for Insurance Research said New Jersey's
Administrative Procedures Act required an adversarial hearing when,
in the course of reorganization, regulated businesses, like
insurance companies, are deciding the disposition of property or
benefits. But the legislation exempts Prudential from that kind of
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential argues that it needs confidentiality to protect trade
secrets. And it says that adversarial-style hearings could be
expensive and time consuming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we create more noise around the process, it takes
value away from the company,'' said Michael Chesman, a senior
lawyer for Prudential. ``Does that do anything for the
policyholder?''

LONDON JOURNAL: SOME FIND BLAIR'S NEW ACCENT A MITE MATEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Tony Blair is a prime minister who prides himself on
his common touch, so there was nothing particularly surprising
about what he said recently on a British talk show.
</P>
<P>
   Blair delighted his host, Des O'Connor, by telling a joke about
his mother-in-law. He described how he hung up on Queen Elizabeth
when an airplane pilot ordered him to turn off his cell phone. And
he told a long story about how he was presented with a gift horse
by the mayor of a French village. ``I wasn't sure whether to ride
it or eat it,'' Blair said.
</P>
<P>
   Ha, ha (or not). But joking aside, where were the prime
minister's T's? What happened to his H's? Why, when he tried to
say, ``they put on a little show for us with the mayor of the
little village,'' did it come out as, ``they pu' on a li'l show for
us with they mayor of the li'l village?'' And why did he say,
referring to the horse, that `` 'e's come back to England''?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Bruce Anderson said, writing in The Daily Mail, ``Why did
the prime minister take reverse elocution lessons?''
</P>
<P>
   As it watched the show, a nation acutely aware of the nuances of
accent noticed with a jolt that the prime minister had apparently
changed his. The familiar Blair, with his soothing, almost
preacherly voice _ a voice that sets him linguistically above the
working classes and is a slightly modified example of what is known
here as Received Pronunciation _ had disappeared. In his place was
a new Tony, a Tony speaking something called Estuary English, a
hybrid accent that was first identified in 1984 and says something
else altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Taking some of its cues from traditional Cockney, such as the
tendency to drop the ``t'' in words like ``lot'' and ``little,''
Estuary English has become increasingly prevalent in the south of
England and is generally used by modestly accented people seeking
to appear more upscale, and by people with upscale accents,
particularly teen-agers in expensive schools, seeking to sound more
street-wise.
</P>
<P>
   Blair might well have picked up the accent from his young son,
who attends the sort of posh London school where Estuary English
flourishes in the mouths of students wanting street cred, said Paul
Kerswill, a lecturer in linguistics at Reading University. Maybe
Blair was looking for his own sort of street cred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants to be cool,'' said Kerswill, noting that
Blair has made it clear that he enjoys playing the guitar in his
spare time. ``We probably got it from the Americans, the idea that
you can be a politician and hip at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding itself a bit on the defensive about the episode, Downing
Street acknowledged that the prime minister sounded different, but
denied that he had actually put on a new accent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're on a show like that and you're telling an
anecdote, your voice changes to reflect the tempo of the
anecdote,'' a spokeswoman said. ``We all change our voice to suit
the thing that we're talking about. And the prime minister is very
good at impersonations.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a country obsessed with accent, Blair's obvious shift
downward was a sign of the times and an interesting insight into
his style as prime minister. While other prime ministers have
certainly taken their accents down a few notches when it suited
them, their forays into regional or working-class accents have
generally reflected their own backgrounds. Harold Wilson, for
instance, altered his voice to stress his own Yorkshire origins
when speaking to his constituents, but spruced it up again when
speaking to, say, foreign dignitaries suited him.
</P>
<P>
   And in a famous elocutionary makeover, Margaret Thatcher, a
grocer's daughter from Grantham, in Leicestershire, used her iron
will to conceal her humble verbal roots, losing her local dialect
and developing a classically upper-class accent that she then
fine-tuned downward again on the advice of her public-relations
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `You've got to remove some of the posh features,'''
said John Honey, a professor of linguistics at the University of
Botswana and the author of ``Does Accent Matter?'' ``She adopted
that heavy breathing, intensive-care kind of voice. She dropped the
pitch of her voice to sound more soothing and less strident, and
she dropped the use of the impersonal `one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Thatcher's real linguistic self rarely came out. But once,
incandescent with fury in Parliament, she yelled ``You're frit!,''
using dialect for ``frightened.'' It was a slip that her Labor
opponents would taunt her with for the rest of her career as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   While Mrs. Thatcher's successor, John Major, stuck to a bland if
synthetic form of Received Pronunciation, Blair seems to be the
first prime minister to have used Estuary English publicly, a state
of affairs that caused dismay among some language purists, even
those accustomed to hearing it spoken by other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was left screaming: `Tony, you're a public-school,
Oxbridge-educated lawyer,''' Brian Reade wrote in The Daily Mirror.
```Why are you patronizing us?'''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Shelley, vice president of the Queen's English Society,
said, ``I was very disappointed with Tony Blair.'' Referring to the
way he dropped his T's, she added, ``His speech was slovenly and
the glottal stop was the ugliest of the lot.''
</P>
<P>
   To several political reporters, the prime minister's sliding
speech demonstrated nothing other than an alarming, Clintonesque
desire to be all things to all people, to pretend he was ``Reliable
Ron from Romford,'' as Reade put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious explanation is vote-getting: trying to persuade
his audience that he is really one of them,'' Anderson wrote. ``Mr.
Blair is a politician who adapts his personality and views to his
surroundings to avoid disappointment in the opinion polls.''
</P>
<P>
   But veteran language-watchers said they weren't too upset by his
foray into Estuary English. They have previously noted non-Received
Pronunciation anomalies in the prime minister's speech, like the
American-style tendency to muddy hard vowels in words like
``conservative,'' so that it comes out as ``conserva-tuhve,'' and
the tendency not to vocalize his L's, so that ``arsenal'' becomes
``arsenaw''
</P>
<P>
   ``People in public life _ particularly, perhaps, people in
politics _ need always to avoid the impression that they are in a
world apart, in a sort of upper crust,'' said Lord Quirk, a
linguist and member of the House of Lords. ``On the other hand,
they have to avoid giving the impression that they're talking down
and joining in the yobbos, as it were. It is a very difficult mix
to achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   And John Wells, a professor of phonetics at University College,
London, said that the class-driven mix of accents in Britain
virtually insures that people modify their accents all the time, to
seem more sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us have a range of stylistic variations which would
allow us to sound more or less posh, depending on the
circumstances,'' Wells said. ``The problem for anyone in public
life is that whatever you do, you're going to offend someone.''

   TOKYO _ After months of delay, Japan's Parliament completed
passage of a bill Wednesday night that will allow the government to
begin pouring public money into the economy, part of a
fiscal-stimulus package worth roughly $119 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the supplementary budget, which had been
expected, enables Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's government to
show the world that money for the stimulus package of 16.67
trillion yen will start moving into giant projects throughout the
country in hope of lifting the economy out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's approval coincided with a concerted move by the
U.S. and Japanese central banks to prop up the exchange value of
the yen by selling dollars and buying yen in the currency markets.
The Japanese currency had fallen to a series of eight-year lows in
the last week on fears that Japan was not doing enough to revive
its economy.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday here, the yen was trading at 142.01 to the
dollar. In New York, the yen rose sharply, settling at 136.37 to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the government reported its worst annual postwar
economic performance, for the fiscal year that ended on March 31.
Worries spread throughout Asia that a weakening yen could set off
another round of currency devaluations.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the coordinated intervention Wednesday by the Bank
of Japan and the Federal Reserve Bank, along with the impact of
cash flowing into the economy, could give the Japanese government
some breathing room as it sets forth to tackle the challenge of
reducing more than $600 billion in bad bank debt.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's supplementary budget will release 6.1 trillion yen,
or about $4.4 billion, a portion of funds that are part of the
broader package of tax cuts and spending. Economists expect the
impact to be a restoring of some growth to the economy, which will
likely be seen in the October-December quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Ministry officials have said that the funds would be
released almost immediately after passage of the supplementary
budget. And indeed, public works projects have been lined up for
financing.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the delay in passing Wednesday's budget,
despite foreign pressure to speed up the fiscal stimulants, was
essentially unnecessary, for the governing Liberal Democratic Party
has a majority in the lower house, the more powerful of the two
chambers. The budget had been passed by the lower house on Monday.
And some say the party could easily have pushed the budget through
Parliament more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition parties tried Wednesday to submit a resolution
censuring Hashimoto, but the resolution was rejected, and this
paved the way for the vote on the budget in the Japanese Senate on
Thursday.

FANS WARM UP TO LES BLEUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Before the World Cup began, the French
seemed uncertain whether to embrace their national team. But after
a 3-0 victory over South Africa in their opener, les Francais are
preparing to jump on the bandwagon with Les Bleus.
</P>
<P>
   France played offensively, took chances, looked stylish. Just
what their fans wanted, especially the Parisians.
</P>
<P>
   Now France has a more difficult task than winning over the
public. It will meet Saudi Arabia at the Stade de France Thursday
night. France could clinch a berth in the second round, but just as
significantly, it could set the stage for the elliptical,
80,000-seat stadium to take on a life after the World Cup concludes
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Stade de France, inaugurated this year, is a potential $450
million white elephant, with no permanent tenant. Paris St. Germain
plays in Parc des Princes and has no intention of deserting a loyal
fan base.
</P>
<P>
   So Liza, Zizou, and Duga _ the French strike force of Bixente
Lizarazu, Zinedine Zidane, and Christophe Dugarry _ will be
expected to both score goals and capture imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   France has an effective combination of hard-line defenders, led
by the Chelsea-bound, Ghana-born Marcel Desailly, plus domestic
midfielders Didier Deschamps and Emmanuel Petit. Deschamps, the
country's player of the year, was once described as ``a water
carrier'' by former star Eric Cantona. But Cantona added that such
workers are necessary to allow the creators to create.
</P>
<P>
   Though Cantona is the most accomplished and well-known French
player of recent vintage, he and David Ginola were dropped from the
national team after it failed to qualify for USA '94. France had
set up training sites in the US while needing a result at home
against either Israel or Bulgaria in its final two qualifiers. That
failure, combined with a similar failure in 1990, caused a feeling
of letdown among fans. Better not to allow hopes to rise with this
team.
</P>
<P>
   But the new generation of Les Bleus appears capable of erasing
those memories.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia has adopted a Brazilian approach, but the Saudis
have not raised their game to the Brazilian level. Coach Carlos
Alberto Parreira, who guided Brazil to the '94 title, could be
fired if the Saudis fail to at least tie. Parreira, who guided the
MetroStars to the bottom of Major League Soccer's Eastern
Conference last year, will have earned about $1 million for six
months' work.

ITALY OVERWHELMS CAMEROON, 3-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France _ Fiat magnate Gianni Agnelli, Prime
Minister Romano Prodi, and the many other Italians who wanted
Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero to play in the same game
gained some satisfaction last night. But the country's two most
creative players did not play together as the Italians took a 3-0
victory over Cameroon to virtually clinch a place in the second
round of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel changes, which included using Luigi DiBiagio and
Francesco Moriero in the starting lineup, and the uninhibited
offensive attitudes of the Italians marked a major change from the
team which had advanced through qualifying with the most
conservative of tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero, recovering from a leg injury, replaced Baggio in the
second half as Italy displayed much more attacking flair and
defensive composure than when it rallied to tie Chile, 2-2, in its
opener.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no guarantee such aesthetically pleasing ideas will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Del Piero went in, it was a reminder of the game in the
1970s,'' coach Cesare Maldini said. ``That kind of game was
fashionable 20 years ago, but not now. When a player is tired, he
is substituted.''
</P>
<P>
   Before tiring, Baggio crossed to Luigi DiBiagio for the first
goal in the seventh minute. Del Piero helped set up Christian Vieri
for the last goal in the 90th minute. And Moriero, in only his
fourth international game, set up Vieri for the second goal only
minutes after Del Piero entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first goal, we suffered a little bit and felt some
fear of them,'' Maldini said. ``But we comported ourselves very
well. We still have a lot to do. The whole team played perfectly.
We all responded together, and together we won.''
</P>
<P>
   But Italy had to overcome the rough tactics of Cameroon, which
had three players cautioned and Raymond Kalla Nkongo ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians put the pressure on early with Moriero on the right
wing. Vieri had a chip over goalkeeper Jacques Songo'o cleared off
the line by Rigobert Song, then a close drive deflected by Songo'o.
</P>
<P>
   Moriero sped past the Cameroon defense in the seventh minute and
was tripped on the end line by Pierre Nlend Wome. The contact
appeared incidental, but Australian referee Edward Lennie cautioned
Wome.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians converted the free kick into a corner on the other
side. Baggio capitalized on the uncertainty of the defense with a
short corner to Alessandro Nesta, then a sharp cross to DiBiagio,
who headed unmarked past Songo'o.
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon found its rhythm with 18-year-old Salomon Olembe
supplying the touches in midfield. But the Indomitable Lions began
asserting themselves too aggressively. Baggio went down from a
tackle by Pierre Njanka. Alessandro Costacurta was cautioned for
taking down Didier Angibeau. DiBiagio made a sliding tackle on
Kalla, whose cleats went into DiBiagio's thigh.
</P>
<P>
   DiBiagio departed on a stretcher and was booed. Songo'o ran to
the halfway line at halftime to berate DiBiagio, who lifted his
pant leg to reveal his injury.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd began supporting Cameroon, which has several players
performing for French clubs and three naturalized Frenchmen.
</P>
<P>
   Olembe, who was brought to Nantes at 15, supplied the
sophistication and inspiration. He slid a perfect through ball to
Joseph-Desire Job of Lyon, and GianLuca Paglialuca punched the shot
over the goal for a corner in the 13th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Italy appeared content to slow things down and coast into the
second round. But Cameroon forced the action with 10 players, going
all out with substitutes Job, Alphonse Tchami, and 17-year-old
Samuel Eto'o.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the half, Demetrio Albertini, until recently
considered indispensable to the Italian midfield, failed twice to
connect with Paolo Maldini on simple passes and was replaced by
Roberto DiMatteo. Del Piero then replaced Baggio.
</P>
<P>
   Italy wisely waited for the Lions to falter, either through
fatigue or overconfidence. The strategy worked as Olembe became
either too presumptuous or too tired and attempted to dribble
through a defender's legs in the center circle.
</P>
<P>
   Moriero took the play toward the penalty arc and fed Vieri, who
chipped it past Songo'o for a two-goal lead in the 31st minute.
</P>
<P>
   Italy invited the Lions to come forward, then counter.
Cameroon's last good chance occurred in the 28th minute when Joseph
Ndo, son of the country's leading comedian, Oncle Otsama, slipped
past Paolo Maldini for a corner.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lions were not in a humorous mood when Italy began
picking them apart, and Vieri powered past Wome and Songo'o for the
final goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians can advance as Group B's top seed with a tie
against Austria in Saint-Denis Tuesday.

WITH SON GONE, ALL SHE WANTS IS A PIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nita Robbins lost her only son in a war that divided this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Now all she wants from her government is a new Gold Star pin,
one in which the deep-blue enamel background isn't chipped and
worn.
</P>
<P>
   First Lt. Russell Robbins was in Vietnam only seven weeks before
a helicopter crash took his life. During his days ``in country,''
he wrote home to his mother seven times.
</P>
<P>
   The mission that deadly day in 1967 was to move six helicopter
loads of soldiers into Viet Cong territory. The troops were short
one door gunner. The 25-year-old Army lieutenant from Fort Worth
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they got to the landing zone, the motor failed on the
helicopter,'' Nita Robbins said. ``The pilot got it almost down to
the ground before it hit a concrete dike in a rice paddy. It slung
the plane around and threw Russell out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many men were injured in the crash, but only Robbins died. The
Defense Department sent his mother a Gold Star pin and a letter of
condolence that praised her only son for his service to his
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Wilson started the tradition of sending gold stars to
mothers who lost children in battle, because he believed that the
black armbands worn during World War I were too somber.
</P>
<P>
   Nita Robbins wore her pin constantly, to the point that the
distinctive blue enamel chipped away from between the tiny
five-pointed star and the wreath that surrounds it. She wasn't sure
how to go about getting a replacement, so she turned to a neighbor
for help.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Herman lives next door to Robbins in a west Fort Worth
apartment complex. A veteran of World War II, Herman is the exact
opposite of the genteel Comanche native he is trying to help. A
transplant to Texas from New York, Herman is blunt and high-energy;
Robbins, a former schoolteacher, is soft-spoken and low-key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Carswell to see if someone out there could help,''
Herman said. ``Some young girl said maybe Mrs. Robbins could buy
one in the BX. Have you ever heard of such a thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to local military offices proved fruitless, so
Herman started his letter-writing campaign. His communique to the
Army's adjutant general remains unanswered, but Robbins said she
appreciates his effort.
</P>
<P>
   Herman's contact with Rep. Kay Granger's office resulted in a
call back to Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they are working on it,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   An aide in Granger's district office in Fort Worth confirmed
that she has received a request for assistance from Robbins but
would not discuss specifics. It could take a month or more to get
an answer, depending on the backlog of requests at the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said she is surprised at the lengths to which Herman is
going in assisting her, from contacting the representative's office
to calling the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was going to go this far,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins counts herself blessed. In good health as she approaches
her 80th birthday in August, she still does all her own housework
and shopping. Her dog, Charlie _ a lovably strange mix of chow,
dachshund and corgi _ has been her companion since her husband died
four years ago of Alzheimer's disease. Two of her four daughters
live in Texas and stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   But Herman worries about his neighbor, and he believes that a
replacement pin would will bring her the peace of mind that he
feels she is missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like a fair trade,'' Herman said; ``her son for a pin.''

ROSENBERG TO STEP DOWN AS DUNKIN' DONUTS PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After 35 years on the job, Robert M. Rosenberg is doing what
perhaps Michael Jordan should do _ going out on top.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the 60-year-old Rosenberg's duties as president
and chief executive of Dunkin' Donuts will be assumed by his chosen
successor, 26-year company veteran Jack Shafer, 54, who now serves
as chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't anticipate any radical course corrections,'' Shafer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg, who ran doughnut shops during summer breaks from
Harvard Business School, is a son of Bill Rosenberg, who grew the
chain from a string of canteen trucks after World World II.
</P>
<P>
   When Shafer takes over the Randolph, Mass. company, it will mark
the first time the chain is run by someone who isn't a member of
the Rosenberg family.
</P>
<P>
   Since late 1989, Dunkin' Donuts has been owned by Allied Domecq
PLC, a British food-and-beverage conglomerate, whose portfolio of
US quick-service restaurants also includes the Baskin-Robbins ice
cream stores and the Togo's sandwich shops.
</P>
<P>
   Presided over by Rosenberg, the three chains' 6,500 US stores
had about $2.5 billion in sales last year. In 1963, his first year
as president, Dunkin' Donuts had sales of $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Recently remarried and exploring the possibility of teaching at
Babson College, Rosenberg said this was the ideal time to step
down, from both a personal and business standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-five years is a long time,'' he said. The chain's
``momentum is terrific,'' and Dunkin' Donuts is seeing the first
signs of success for its new growth strategy.
</P>
<P>
   With too many restaurants for too few eaters, the fast-food
industry is past its salad days of explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   But while Boston Market seems to teeter near bankruptcy, and
McDonald's Corp. looks to boost nearly flat US sales, Dunkin'
Donuts has posted double-digit sales gains month after month.
</P>
<P>
   New products such as bagels and ``Coolatta'' drinks have helped
drive sales, said Rosenberg, who added he's redefined Dunkin'
Donuts ``three or four times'' during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   When Rosenberg became company president in 1963, some Dunkin'
Donuts stores still sold cheeseburgers. The menu has continually
undergone deletions and additions.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Dunkin' Donuts has distanced itself a bit from its
doughnut heritage to emphasize coffee, which could account for $720
million of the chain's projected $1.9 billion in sales this fiscal
year. Doughnut sales are projected at $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   One prong of the company's growth strategy is to combine
Allied's three chains under one roof in the hope of luring
customers all day long. Dunkin' Donuts would provide the morning
business. Togo's would draw the lunch crowd, and Baskin-Robbins
would attract ice cream lovers in the afternoon and evening.
</P>
<P>
   While Rosenberg took his company public in 1968 and wooed Allied
as a white knight during the hostile-takeover era, perhaps his
greatest triumph has been adapting to new food trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stick with a menu that was successful in the '60s,
you're in trouble,'' Rosenberg said.

   WASHINGTON _ Texas' gubernatorial candidates, seeking to shore
up support for the fall elections, are cuddling up to special
interests in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. George W. Bush is expected to raise at least
$500,000 on Thursday at a $5,000-per-plate dinner at the Four
Seasons Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Land Commissioner Garry Mauro plans to cash in on his 25-year
friendship with President Clinton at a June 23 reception and
dinner. The Democratic candidate expects the event to raise
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Bush as the front-runner for his party's presidential
nomination in 2000. And that is making the governor's fund-raiser a
hot ticket inside the Washington Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington special-interest groups would only have an interest
in building a relationship with Bush if he is going to run for
president,'' said Paul Hendrie, spokesman for the Center for
Responsive Politics, an advocacy group for overhauling the nation's
campaign finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Mauro, it is a case of the Democrats trying to hit back
at Bush and knock him down the best they can before he becomes a
national player,'' Hendrie said. ``If they can cut into his margin
of victory, it would be viewed as a weakness in his national
standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush downplays the speculation of a presidential bid, saying he
is concentrating solely on a second term as governor of the second
largest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``My head and my heart are in the state of Texas, and I intend
to be the first (Texas) governor elected to back-to-back, four-year
terms. No governor has ever done that, and I intend to win,'' Bush
said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   A lopsided victory would give Bush leverage over the Legislature
next year, as well as a springboard into a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush is running for president,'' Mauro spokesman Joe
Cutbirth said from Austin. ``Why won't he just say so? It's kind of
goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law prohibits Bush from using money raised for
his re-election bid in a future presidential run, Cutbirth accused
the governor of seeking a forum with ``every Gucci-wearing tobacco
and HMO lobbyist in Washington'' who could be tapped for a White
House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those expected to attend the Bush fund-raiser are
political colleagues of former President George Bush, the
governor's father.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a Bush campaign spokeswoman in Austin, dismissed
suggestions that presidential ambitions underscore the Washington
fund-raising event.
</P>
<P>
   She said the governor attributes the overwhelming interest in
the fund-raiser to ``people who want good leaders, who support good
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has raised roughly $14 million for his re-election race,
far outpacing the $2.2 million the Mauro has received.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will attend a $1,000-per-person reception at the
Sheraton Carlton Hotel on Tuesday for Mauro, and first lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton will be featured later at $5,000-per-plate dinner.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Vice President Al Gore will attend a fund-raising
event in El Paso, Texas, on June 25 to help Mauro raise $150,000 in
his uphill battle to defeat Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The three events could raise at least $400,000 for the Mauro
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also will speak to the National Press Club on Monday to
outline the political differences between him and Bush.

MANUFACTURING JOBS RISE IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts manufacturers added 6,900 new jobs during
the first three months of this year, 400 more than during all of
last year, according to an industry report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 456,800 manufacturing jobs counted in March represent the
highest number in the state since 1993, according to the report
done for the Associated Industries of Massachusetts by Standard &AMP;
Poor's DRI of Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But that total is two-thirds what it was in 1984, when the
defense, computer, and aerospace industries all were booming.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday's report cast doubt on whether the latest upturn
can continue for long.
</P>
<P>
   One storm warning, said Sara Johnson, regional economist at
Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI, is a decline in exports to Asia since last
fall. Thirty-one percent of Massachusetts exports went to Asia last
year, much of it shipped by Bay State suppliers to the
semiconductor industry. Exports to Canada also have dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Also, layoffs are in store this summer as Compaq Computer Corp.
digests its acquisition of Digital Equipment Corp. _ and they come
in the wake of plant closings by Polaroid Corp. in Norwood,
Lockheed Martin Corp. in Pittsfield, and OSRAM/Sylvania in Danvers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, last winter's job losses were more than offset by
growth in employment at smaller firms that do everything from
supplying cement for Boston's Central Artery project to building
high-speed switches for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really amazes me is the breadth of this activity,''
Johnson said. The growth list included electronics, computers,
printing and publishing, scientific and medical instruments, and
metal fabrication. Fifteen of 19 industrial sectors showed growth,
two were stable, and only the two smallest, footwear and petroleum,
saw year-to-year declines.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new jobs also was bolstered by managerial
decisions to cut back on overtime. ``The state's manufacturers have
been on a hiring spree, choosing to hire new workers rather than
extend overtime hours,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Industries president John Gould attributed some of
the gains to ``the success of policy initiatives,'' including
investment tax credits, lower unemployment insurance costs, and a
reduction in health care costs, ``that have made Massachusetts a
more competitive location for industry.''

(RESENDING TO ADD BYLINE) 
WITH SON GONE, ALL SHE WANTS IS A PIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. ``JILL'' LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nita Robbins lost her only son in a war that divided this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Now all she wants from her government is a new Gold Star pin,
one in which the deep-blue enamel background isn't chipped and
worn.
</P>
<P>
   First Lt. Russell Robbins was in Vietnam only seven weeks before
a helicopter crash took his life. During his days ``in country,''
he wrote home to his mother seven times.
</P>
<P>
   The mission that deadly day in 1967 was to move six helicopter
loads of soldiers into Viet Cong territory. The troops were short
one door gunner. The 25-year-old Army lieutenant from Fort Worth
volunteered.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they got to the landing zone, the motor failed on the
helicopter,'' Nita Robbins said. ``The pilot got it almost down to
the ground before it hit a concrete dike in a rice paddy. It slung
the plane around and threw Russell out.''
</P>
<P>
   Many men were injured in the crash, but only Robbins died. The
Defense Department sent his mother a Gold Star pin and a letter of
condolence that praised her only son for his service to his
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Wilson started the tradition of sending gold stars to
mothers who lost children in battle, because he believed that the
black armbands worn during World War I were too somber.
</P>
<P>
   Nita Robbins wore her pin constantly, to the point that the
distinctive blue enamel chipped away from between the tiny
five-pointed star and the wreath that surrounds it. She wasn't sure
how to go about getting a replacement, so she turned to a neighbor
for help.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Herman lives next door to Robbins in a west Fort Worth
apartment complex. A veteran of World War II, Herman is the exact
opposite of the genteel Comanche native he is trying to help. A
transplant to Texas from New York, Herman is blunt and high-energy;
Robbins, a former schoolteacher, is soft-spoken and low-key.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Carswell to see if someone out there could help,''
Herman said. ``Some young girl said maybe Mrs. Robbins could buy
one in the BX. Have you ever heard of such a thing?''
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to local military offices proved fruitless, so
Herman started his letter-writing campaign. His communique to the
Army's adjutant general remains unanswered, but Robbins said she
appreciates his effort.
</P>
<P>
   Herman's contact with Rep. Kay Granger's office resulted in a
call back to Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they are working on it,'' Robbins said.
</P>
<P>
   An aide in Granger's district office in Fort Worth confirmed
that she has received a request for assistance from Robbins but
would not discuss specifics. It could take a month or more to get
an answer, depending on the backlog of requests at the Defense
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins said she is surprised at the lengths to which Herman is
going in assisting her, from contacting the representative's office
to calling the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it was going to go this far,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins counts herself blessed. In good health as she approaches
her 80th birthday in August, she still does all her own housework
and shopping. Her dog, Charlie _ a lovably strange mix of chow,
dachshund and corgi _ has been her companion since her husband died
four years ago of Alzheimer's disease. Two of her four daughters
live in Texas and stay in touch.
</P>
<P>
   But Herman worries about his neighbor, and he believes that a
replacement pin would will bring her the peace of mind that he
feels she is missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like a fair trade,'' Herman said; ``her son for a pin.''

WOODS COMFORTABLE WITH ROLE IN US OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The talk on the eve of the US Open a year ago at
Congressional was about Tiger Woods, the Grand Slam nobody had ever
won in this game, and his date with destiny. He was golf's grandest
story following his record romp in the Masters at age 21, the next
Jack Nicklaus. He had fired the imaginations of the young, and his
presence was shooting the size of purses to highs never envisioned
before he burst on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Woods remains a major player on the global stage, but it was
interesting to note Tuesday that a news conference Wednesdayheld by
his cart-riding former Stanford teammate, Casey Martin, was much
better attended than one an hour later at which Woods talked about
his chances. The Grand Slam? Only Mark O'Meara can pull it off this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Masters blitz, Woods has returned to earth.
He had three double bogeys at Congressional and following an
opening 74 bolted, refusing to talk to the media after finishing
tied for 19th. In the British Open at Royal Troon, he had two
triple bogeys and a quadruple bogey and finished tied for 24th. He
had three doubles in the PGA Championship at Winged Foot and wound
up tied for 29th. At that event, he played 10 holes in plus-24
figures.
</P>
<P>
   There was a stretch this year, starting at Bay Hill, when he
played 11 competitive rounds without shooting in the 60s. That
included the four rounds of the Masters, where he found more
difficult conditions than last year but played well enough to
finish tied for eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Woods's return to the summit, at the BellSouth Classic
in Duluth, Ga., his first victory on the US PGA Tour since the
Western Open last July. This brings Woods to the US Open at the
Olympic Club, and he appears buoyant, confident, and ready to win
his second major championship on a course that, despite the many
rounds he played here during his college days, many say is unsuited
to his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the challenge,'' said Woods. ``I like it when people
say I can't (win at Olympic Club) and it definitely gets me a
little revved up. You also have to understand you've still got to
go out there and play the game no matter what the motivational
factor is. It's all aside once you step on the first tee. You have
to go out there and get your focus and maintain your concentration.
It's patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic isn't an overpowering course in terms of distance; it
will take the driver out of players' hands. The rough, said Woods,
isn't as bad here as it was last year at Congressional, where he
found too much of it. The greens are fairly soft, but everybody has
said they will be firm and slick, and position is the key to
winning on a course where Ben Hogan was beaten in a playoff by Jack
Fleck in the 1955 Open, where Arnold Palmer squandered a seven-shot
lead and lost to Billy Casper in a playoff in 1966, and where Tom
Watson lost by a stroke 11 years ago when Scott Simpson birdied two
of the last four holes.
</P>
<P>
   The US Open hasn't been kind to Woods, but he laughs off the
suggestion that he can't win one. ``I was 21 when you were
speculating (on the Grand Slam) and I'm only 22 now,'' he said. ``I
have a lot of time to play this tournament, and as time goes on I
think I am going to improve and really learn how to play a US Open
golf course. It's different from any other tournament, where
straight and down the middle and making pars wins. Normally you
have got to go 20 under par, and 59s are now becoming regular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is changing. The way the golf course is set up under USGA
conditions, you have really got to be patient and (realize) par is
really a good score. It's different from the mindset we have
normally. There are players like myself who have struggled with
that in the past. My preparation has really been intense.
Physically, mentally, hitting golf balls and lifting has been
pretty intense. You try to get your game better every day, and
hopefully by the weekend it is on full cylinder.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, whom Woods thinks of as ``a big brother,'' won the
Masters with a dramatic 20-foot putt on the 72d hole to vault past
Fred Couples and David Duval with a birdie/-birdie finish. O'Meara,
who has won five times down the road at Pebble Beach and plays a
lot of golf with Woods, said the experience of a year ago is a plus
for his young friend. ``I'm sure Tiger learned a lot last year at
the last three majors about being patient,'' said O'Meara. ``He's a
very smart kid. He learns from his mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in an informal poll in the press tent, just one reporter
picked Woods to win. The top name was Colin Montgomerie, who saw
the Open slip away last year at Congressional. The next most
popular choices were British Open champion Justin Leonard, David
Duval, and Jim Furyk. Then came Tom Lehman, the only other player
with multiple votes. Ernie Els, the defending champion, received
just a solitary vote.
</P>
<P>
   The back spasms that forced Els to withdraw after nine holes of
last week's Buick Classic in Rye, N.Y., may have raised doubts
among the press and public, but Els remains confident. ``It's
frustrating, especially last week,'' he said. ``I've had such a
nice record at Westchester. I've never played just nine holes and
pulled out of a golf tournament. Maybe all these things happen for
a reason. As long as we're not playing that long a course, I might
be OK. You have to put the ball in play and take it from there. It
might work to my advantage; you never know.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Montgomerie, last year was not the first time he came
close. He lost to Els in a US Open playoff four years ago at
Oakmont. He bogeyed the 71st hole to miss out on a playoff with Els
at Congressional. He lost in a playoff to Steve Elkington in 1995
at Riviera. He's due to win his first major championship. ``It's my
first time here,'' said Montgomerie. ``Last year at Congressional
it was more length and accuracy. Here it is just accuracy. It's
just positioning it. It's a great golf course. I always look
forward to the US Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who after falling short in the Masters seemed almost
relieved to not have to face the media blitz of a year ago, also
has had recent back problems, leading him to withdraw from the
Kemper. He went to Las Vegas, where he spent time with his physical
therapist and his teacher/coach, Butch Harmon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The back's 100 percent,'' Woods said. ``I was playing a lot of
golf at the time and I was doing a lot of running. I went from no
miles to running four, five, six miles every day, and that puts a
little stress on your back. I felt a little twinging, a little
tightening, and a couple of spasms here. I said, `I have to have my
back ready for the US Open,' and I decided to pull out of Kemper. I
basically just stretched it out, warmed it up, and made sure
everything was loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the storied Olympic Club isn't suited for Woods; maybe it
is because of the many times he played it in his two years at
Stanford. ``I wasn't playing as I would have liked to going into
Congressional,'' said Woods. ``I worked hard on the range and just
couldn't find it. My feel was good around the greens, but I just
couldn't drive the ball the way I wanted to. I wasn't comfortable
over my tee shots. This year is different. I feel great about my
swing. I've shot some pretty good numbers lately, and I'm anxious
just to get out there.''

STUDY FINDS KEY TO SPORTS DEATHS IN HEART RHYTHM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Budgeted earlier as BASEBALL-HEART) 
(ps) 
 By PHILIP J. HILTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Matthew Messing was playing hockey in Quincy one
evening in 1995, when an opponent checked him in the chest with a
routine bump. Sixteen-year-old Matthew had taken plenty of checks
before, but after this one, he collapsed on the ice and died
instantly.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, along with nearly 70 others reported in recent
years, had baffled doctors. In each case, they found no injury to
the heart and no previous heart condition in the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers believe they may have found the explanation for
the rare deaths, which go by the medical name of ``commotio
cordis,'' or ``concussion of the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine,
researchers, led by a team from the Tufts-New England Medical
Center in Boston, describe their experiments along with suggestions
for preventing some deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths apparently result from an unusual and chance
conjunction of events. When the heart is beating, there is a
fleeting moment, about a hundredth of a second long, when the
electrical rhythm is resetting, so to speak, in the milliseconds
just before a beat. During that moment, if a moderate blow is
directed to exactly the spot on the chest above the heart, the
electrical rhythm breaks, and the heart quits beating, and instead
``fibrillates'' or quivers uselessly inside the chest.
</P>
<P>
   If the blow is too strong or too weak, or the timing is a few
milliseconds off, the catastrophe does not occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a rare event, so it's important not to scare parents
away from having their children in sports, for example,'' said Dr.
N.A. Mark Estes, director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at
Tufts University School of Medicine. ``There are also some
possibilities for preventing the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the group tested ``safety baseballs'' that are
sometimes used by children when learning baseball and that weigh
the same but are softer than a regular baseball. They found that
the softest version was much less likely to cause commotio in
experimental animals when it struck the chest in the milliseconds
just before a beat.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, doctors were unsure of what caused commotio, and
experiments in which blows were delivered to the chests of animals
failed to reproduce the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, led by Estes, Mark Link and Paul Wang, also
physicians at Tufts-New England, suggested that earlier experiments
had delivered blows that were too powerful, and not properly timed.
So in their experiment, young pigs were given blows in the chest
with a ball fired by a machine at 30 mph _ an average throw in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 blows delivered during the 15-millisecond ``T-wave''
moment just before a beat, nine caused a young pig to experience
what would have been a fatal heart stop. (The pigs were not
actually killed by the blows, but were quickly revived.) The
potentially fatal reaction in each of the nine cases occurred
immediately on the next heartbeat after impact.
</P>
<P>
   But, in 22 impacts on other pigs that were timed to occur at
other parts of the heartbeat cycle, no potentially fatal heart
failures occurred.
</P>
<P>
   One group of scientists led by Dr. Barry Maron of the
Minneapolis Heart Institute Foundation in Minnesota, has begun to
keep track of commotio instances, and has so far counted 69 that
have been reported in the world over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were usually children, often playing sports,
including a 6-year-old died when a baseball struck him in the
chest; a 14-year-old died when playing lacrosse and the ball hit
him in the chest; a 14-year-old died during a karate match when he
was hit lightly in the chest. In a different sort of incident, an
11-year-old boy died after his father struck him in the chest when
the boy gave the wrong answer to a question as the father was
trying to teach the boy to tell time.

   In an editorial accompanying the article, journal deputy editor
Dr. Gregory Curfman, noted that 69 is probably an underestimate of
the actual number of cases. He said that safety measures, such as
the safety baseballs now recommended for young baseball players by
the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or chest protectors for use
in hockey, football and other sports, may prevent future commotio
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Shoulder pads now worn by hockey, football and lacrosse players
are inadequate to protect the vulnerable spot on the chest, but
extended pads might.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest value of the article,'' Curfman wrote, ``will be
to raise awareness about commotio cordis, demystify its cause, and
educate us about the recognition and prevention of this tragic
phenomenon.''

STATESMANSHIP GIVEN TOP ODDS IN N.H. SWEEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, N.H. _ Ok By Me, the defending champion, will have to get
past a top horse in Statesmanship to defend his crown in the
$200,000 New Hampshire Sweepstakes Handicap at Rockingham Park
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A field of eight was drawn Wednesday for the Grade III event, to
be run at 1 1/8 miles on the turf course, with Statesmanship listed
as the 9-5 choice and Ok By Me right behind at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ok By Me has not won a race in five starts since capturing last
year's Sweeps in impressive fashion under Joe Bravo. But he has
overcome an ankle problem and run in top company since, most
recently finishing third in the Connaught Cup at Woodbine May 30.
Statesmanship comes to Rock off a nose score as the favorite in the
Red Bank Handicap at Monmouth May 25. As in the Red Bank, he will
be ridden by Jose Santos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bringing Bravo in to ride Ok By Me (Frank Lovato rode
him in Canada), and he fits this horse well,'' said trainer H.
James Bond. ``Our horse likes this course, and I hope we can take
this race again. He worked (a half-mile) in :49 1/5 over the
Saratoga training track (Tuesday morning). He was the only one to
go out there all day over the sloppy going and he worked awful
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statesmanship is a very formidable opponent. He was tough in
Florida all winter. (Trainer) Christophe Clement does a great job
with all those turf horses and he's not bringing Statesmanship up
to Rockingham because he has nothing better to do. He's the horse I
personally fear the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Bomfim, a legitimate speed horse who has won two of his last
three starts on the front end, certainly would set the pace in the
Sweeps, as he did in the Red Bank before finishing third, beaten
just a half-length. But trainer Pat Kelly is not fully committed to
coming and may keep Bomfim in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bill Mott entered Daylight Savings, who won a $60,000
allowance race at Churchill Downs May 28 under Pat Day. Mott did
not name a jockey and may be looking to use a rider from New York
or a local rider if Daylight Savings does come. And trainer Kiaran
McLaughlin entered Tamhid, who has been competing in allowance
races at Belmont, but did not name a rider. He, too, may just be
kicking the tires.

TRUCKERS' CASE AGAINST `DATELINE NBC' OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGOR _ Raymond Veilleux, 52, has been a trucker his entire
adult life _ driving them, selling them, and leasing them for
marathon hauls that criss-cross the country.
</P>
<P>
   So, when ``Dateline NBC'' asked if one of his rigs could be
followed from California to Chelsea, Mass., Veilleux allegedly
agreed on the condition that the show portrayed the trucking
industry in a ``positive'' light.
</P>
<P>
   Veilleux and the truck's driver said network employees gave them
that promise _ several times _ in telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the two-part ``Dateline NBC'' show used Veilleux's
truck and its driver as examples of all that is wrong with the
business. The problems: violations of federal rules limiting
driving time, falsified logbooks, alarmingly little sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``American highways are a trucker's killing field,'' the show
declared.
</P>
<P>
   Before the credits had finished rolling across the screen,
Veilleux took a phone call from a customer who told him he had
destroyed not only his own business, but the industry as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial that opened Wednesday in federal court here, a jury
will be asked to decide whether ``Dateline NBC'' staff lied to
Veilleux and truck driver Peter Kennedy, defamed them, and caused
them physical and emotional distress. The plaintiffs are asking for
unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   An attorney for ``Dateline NBC'' said no promises were made to
Veilleux or the driver, and that the report was an accurate,
balanced account of the journey. Bernard Kubetz, the attorney, said
Kennedy even admitted before the trip that he typically broke the
law on long runs.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's lawyer, William Robitzek, said his client has a
longstanding reputation as a safe driver, and that the
coast-to-coast trip complied with federal limits until the last day
of the six-day journey. On that leg, according to Robitzek, Kennedy
exceeded the 10-hour driving limit _ but only to accommodate the
logistical demands of the ``Dateline NBC'' crew.
</P>
<P>
   For Kennedy, who has logged millions of miles on America's
roads, the show's repercussions have included death threats, verbal
abuse from other truckers, ``harassment'' from inspectors, and
constant anxiety that his friends said has turned him into ``a
basket case. And for Veilleux, the program has been the most
devastating event of his small-town life in Oakland, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The expectations had been otherwise. Kennedy told Veilleux that
he had enjoyed the NBC crew immensely. He even posed for a picture
with NBC correspondent Fred Francis, arms linked in good
fellowship, to commemorate the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But all that changed on April 19, 1995, when the first segment
of ``Keep on Truckin''' was broadcast. ``What you're about to hear
about the drivers of many of these trucks won't make you feel any
safer,'' a national audience heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 27 years of hard driving, Kennedy says he has racked up
over 3 million miles, sleeping less than he should, and gambling
that his fatal fatigue number doesn't come up,'' the program said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Dateline NBC'' told viewers, Kennedy ``says he
has to lie to inspectors to stay on the road.... But this
stay-awake-and-on-the-road mentality has led to many accidents and
deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   Veilleux was stunned by the show. When the second installment
aired on April 26, Veilleux watched from a hospital bed, a
cardiologist at his side to monitor the chest pains that he was
suffering, Robitzek said.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast was a crippling blow to a business that Veilleux
had built over decades with an excellent safety record, according
to Robitzek.
</P>
<P>
   The experience also destroyed his trust in the news media. ``I
don't believe what I see anymore,'' Veilleux said.
</P>
<P>
   The lengthy allegations of deception, according to the lawsuit,
``must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a
civilized community.''
</P>
<P>
   Kubetz, the NBC attorney, said no serious journalist would ever
make the kind of promises that Veilleux alleges he obtained.
Kennedy was told before the trip that anything that happened en
route to Massachusetts, and anything he said or did in transit,
would be fair game, Kubetz said.

L.L. BEAN GIVES MULLEN $20 MILLION AD ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   L.L. Bean Inc., the famed Maine purveyor of outdoor equipment
and apparel, said Wednesday it has awarded its advertising account
to Mullen.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated annual advertising budget of $20 million to
$25 million, L.L. Bean should be one of Mullen's biggest clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great American brand with virtually 100 percent
awareness,'' said president Joe Grimaldi &UR;  &LR; Mullen, which is in
Wenham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   While other finalists in an ad agency review gave ``excellent
presentations,'' what helped clinch the victory for Mullen was its
``brand experience'' in the outdoor category, said Steve Fuller,
L.L. Bean's director of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen currently creates advertising for Swiss Army Brands and
Malden Mills, the maker of Polartec climate-control fabric.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Mullen also worked for Timberland Co., a
maker of boots and outdoor apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen's first work for L.L. Bean, of Freeport, Maine, should
break in time for the holidays, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, Bean's advertising had been handled by
Bronner Slosberg Humphrey of Boston, a direct-marketing firm.
</P>
<P>
   But with sales up only slightly last year to $1.07 billion, L.L.
Bean apparently decided to explore other marketing options in hopes
of regaining its usually robust growth rates.
</P>
<P>
   So L.L. Bean hired Pile and Co. of Boston to conduct an ad
agency review. The review narrowed the search to three finalists:
Mullen, the Richards Group of Dallas, and Carmichael Lynch of
Minneapolis. Earlier this week, Mullen was selected.
</P>
<P>
   A Bronner subsidiary will continue to handle L.L. Bean's
marketing efforts on the World Wide Web, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
   When Mullen became Timberland's ad agency in 1989, the Stratham,
N.H. company was known mostly as a maker of workboots.
</P>
<P>
   With Mullen's help and such slogans as, ``Give racism the
boot,'' Timberland was able to make the transition to a lifestyle
brand known as much for apparel fashion prized by urban hipsters as
for rugged footwear loved by lumberjacks.
</P>
<P>
   Timberland and Mullen parted company in 1995. Between 1989 and
1995, Timberland's annual sales grew from about $156 million to
$655 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent sale of Arnold Communications and Hill Holliday
Connors Cosmopulos, Mullen is now the largest independent ad agency
in New England.
</P>
<P>
   By landing L.L. Bean's account, Mullen can claim to be on a
winning streak. Other recent new clients include the Stanley Works,
a tool company; Swiss Army Brands; and Dexter Shoe Co.
</P>
<P>
   Big Mullen clients include Nextel Communications, EMC Corp., and
General Motors Certified Used Vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Mullen had billings of $201 million. For 1998, it now
projects billings of about $240 million.

BOOK TALK: WHEN VOLUMES CROSS THE SEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do books travel across borders and leap oceans?
</P>
<P>
   The Harvill Press in London publishes only foreign books that
have been translated into English. Or nearly so. Some were
originally written in American, and a very few books were by
English authors. But page after page of Harvill's glossy catalogs
list books that were translated from the Italian, the French, the
Russian, the Swedish, the German, the Serbo-Croatian.
</P>
<P>
   And on and on, a sort of atlas of the world's composition,
mostly literary fiction.
</P>
<P>
   There is no publishing company similar to Harvill in the United
States. The book migrations apparently go one way, from the United
States to elsewhere. Against that tide there is usually only the
English mystery and thriller fiction, with only occasional
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Seaver, co-publisher of Arcade Publishing in New York,
said that ``Americans have become isolationist from a literary
point of view compared to the '50s and '60s, when there were lots
of translations here, of Sartre and Beckett and so forth.'' Arcade
publishes only 45 or 50 books a year, with about a dozen foreign
translations, mainly literary fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a foreign translation sells 50,000 or 60,000 copies,
that's a huge exception,'' Seaver said. Five thousand is the more
likely figure, he said. ``For many years we were only able to sell
between 3,000 and 6,000 copies of Octavio Paz, and he was a Nobel
Prize winner.'' (Paz, who died in April, is now selling better for
his current American publisher, Harcourt Brace.)
</P>
<P>
   Arcade's co-publisher, Jeannette Seaver, says she believes that,
simply put, Americans are culturally xenophobic. She cited the
French novel ``Fields of Glory,'' by Jean Rouaud, which sold about
600,000 copies in Europe and at most 4,000 in translation here.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not she is correct about why, it is true that when
one gets beyond P.D. James, Jeffrey Archer, John le Carre and a few
other English mystery and thriller writers, the sale of foreign
translations in the United States is generally like a nearly empty
can of shaving cream: a little air and a few bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   HarperCollins, for instance, has been trying mightily to make a
big seller here out of the Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho, whose
books have been translated into 36 languages in 74 countries and
have sold more than 20 million copies. But only one, ``The
Alchemist,'' has been a best seller in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, other exceptions to the craze for English
mysteries. ``Bridget Jones' Diary'' (Viking), by Helen Fielding, a
British book, will be No. 3 on The New York Times' hardcover
fiction best-seller list on June 28. And in recent years, to name a
few, ``Smilla's Sense of Snow'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux), by the
Danish writer Peter Hoeg, was a best seller here, as was Umberto
Eco's ``Name of the Rose'' (Harcourt Brace). But Eco's latest
novel, ``Island of the Day Before,'' quickly sank in the remainder
sea.
</P>
<P>
   Farrar Straus, which distributes much of Harvill's list here and
does joint publishing with the British house, and Alfred A. Knopf
are among the few American publishers making a real effort to bring
serious foreign books in translation to Americans. So, too, do
Harcourt Brace and New Directions.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest answer, and perhaps the most superficial as well, as
to why foreign books don't sell well here is to attribute literary
dunderheadedness to Americans. That might not be exactly accurate,
but it's certainly true that American education does not breed
comfort with foreign languages and, therefore, foreign names and
places.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, one very successful foreign-rights person for a major
literary agency, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that
``often Americans can't pronounce the author's name, have a lack of
familiarity with the novel's setting and don't understand the
European sensibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also a lack of review attention,'' she said. ``That
has a lot to do with it. Booksellers have a resistance to Vladimir
Who, particularly when Who hasn't been reviewed.'' She added,
``There's a booming business in books in Europe and Asia, and
recently there's been a lot of interesting books from Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The mysteries and economics of American book publishing are in
essence also anti-foreign book. Phillip Blom, an editor at Harvill,
said that the constant repetition that foreign books seldom
translate into cash in the United States perhaps helps to create
``a self-enforcing principle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a British publisher can make some money out of
selling 3,000 copies, and a major American publisher cannot. This
is supported by Seaver, who said that ``if Arcade sells 5,000 or
6,000 copies we can at least break even when a bigger house, with
its larger marketing and editing costs, cannot.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that book scouts now bring foreign novels to
American publishers early on, in manuscript form, rather than as
completed works; thus there is seldom a happy surprise for a house,
the gee-whiz of something finished and solid, and its decision
about whether to buy must be fast. And the easiest response is no.
</P>
<P>
   If trying to sell a foreign list in the United States can be a
thankless task, the reverse can be glorious. American books do well
around the world. The rights person makes 40 to 45 foreign deals a
month, small ones or very healthy ones, even a sale, albeit a small
one, to Bulgaria. Patricia Cornwell and Jay McInerney, for
instance, are hot sales overseas. Harvill's catalogs seem to list
every word Raymond Carter wrote. In Britain, three American books
were on last week's best-seller list of The Sunday Times Books.
</P>
<P>
   So before Americans get a cultural inferiority complex over
their refusal to buy foreign books, they should note the worldwide
popularity of, indeed infatuation with, ``Baywatch,'' the
television show that flopped here, with its bikini-skimpy
intellectual content. It even does as well in Europe as the Rambo
movies.

END OF THE ROAD FOR `BONNIE AND CLYDE' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ After all the robbing was done, after his 3{-month
dash from the law ended in a fateful traffic stop, the thing that
bothered Jimmie Hays the most was that the cops wouldn't let him
kiss his teen-age sweetheart, Shannon Ludington, goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   They just slapped the 29-year-old divorced meat packer and the
17-year-old high school basketball star into cuffs and hauled them
off to jail. Soon they will be transported back to Texas on arrest
warrants for kidnapping, auto theft and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we wanted,'' a hollow-eyed Hays said this week in a
jailhouse interview, ``was to spend our lives together.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, both from the small town of Panhandle, Texas, met in
November through his sister and her brother, who had become engaged
and since have married.
</P>
<P>
   In the clarity of hindsight, Hays admitted the chances of the
romance surviving the yawning age gap and the stern disapproval of
both sets of parents were minute at best. But back in February _ in
the heat of clandestine meetings and all-night telephone
conversations _ they were blinded by love.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had joked about leaving and living on a beach in Mexico,''
Hays said. ``We had laughed about it. But &UR;  &LR; doing it was a spur of
the moment thing. We didn't decide to do it until five minutes
before we left. We left so fast that we didn't even pick up my last
pay check. We were in love and love makes you do crazy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ludington was being held in a facility for juveniles, and
authorities would not allow an interview request to be made to her.
</P>
<P>
   On the afternoon of Feb. 23, as the pair sped south to Lubbock
in Hays' beat-up Buick sedan, the one-time Panhandle football hero
confided to Ludington he might have ``to do some things'' to
finance their flight.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing they did was rob a Lubbock deputy sheriff, an
old acquaintance of Hays, of a 9 mm semiautomatic and a .22-caliber
target pistol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed guns if I was going to pull robberies,'' he said,
``and the only other person I knew had them was my stepfather. I
couldn't bring myself to steal from him.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ludington was alarmed at the turn of events, she concealed
it, Hays said. The couple drove into New Mexico, then cut across to
El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove forever, then sat around in El Paso,'' Hays said. ``I
kind of put a plan together in my head. I knew we couldn't stay in
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to raise funds through robbery, then retire to
southern Mexico until the heat faded. Hays reckoned $30,000 would
be sufficient to keep them in style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Shannon that all I needed was one big hit,'' he said.
``She never was involved in the robberies.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, the plan never quite worked out.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair meandered through the West _ Colorado, Utah, Nevada,
California _ the ``big hit'' never materialized. Hays said he
pulled small jobs every couple of weeks, but declined to say how
many such crimes he committed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been saying on TV and in the papers that we were
Bonnie and Clyde,'' Hays said. ``It wasn't anything like that at
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to get shot and I certainly didn't want to shoot
anyone. I never leveled my gun at anyone. I just showed where it
was tucked in my pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the victims _ proprietors of outlet mall shops or
movie ticket booths _ would hand over the cash. Sometimes they
would just laugh, Hays said. In the latter case, Hays said he would
beat a hasty retreat with as much dignity as he could muster.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, Hays said, he and Ludington kidnapped an Amarillo
car salesman, Gil Reeves, during a test drive at an auto
dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was scared,'' Hays said. ``But I told him we weren't
going to kill him. I told him we'd call the sheriff and get him set
free.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, left bound to a tree about 100 miles east of Amarillo,
was unhurt in the episode. Hays said he did call the sheriff as
promised, but authorities said Reeves was discovered by a farmer
before the call was made.
</P>
<P>
   As the weeks dragged by, the couple spent their time bowling,
playing putt-putt golf and watching movies. The dream of the
Mexican beach began to fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that I would have to rob a bank,'' he said. ``And I
scoped some out. But every time I did, I always saw an armed guard
there. I knew that if I tried to rob a bank, there was going to be
gunplay and I didn't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond his qualms about violence, Hays said, the couple found
that leaving the United States would be difficult without
documents. ``When we were in San Diego, we investigated taking a
ship cruise to southern Mexico, but we couldn't do it without
passports or whatever and Shannon didn't have any identification at
all.''
</P>

   ``It was a short-sighted situation we were in,'' he conceded.
``But once the ball starts rolling, you can't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Hays contends his criminal career left him feeling guilty. A
one-time Abilene Christian University history major, Hays had been
brought up in a strict household. The family attended Church of
Christ services three times weekly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice on Sunday,'' Hays said. ``Those people are in no way to
blame for what I became. Yes, I felt guilty, but I would do
anything for Shannon. I just didn't want to lose her. I did all of
this for love. I wish you could understand that. This was not a joy
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Hays said he often fretted he would ``ruin Shannon's life,''
and, from a brief job he held at the Lubbock County Jail, he knew
well what would happen if they were convicted of their crimes. ``I
know what jail is like,'' he said. ``It's a hellhole. Screaming.
Fights. Jesus knows what else.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple wound up spending the past month here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cheap,'' he said of Las Vegas. ``You could get a good
clean room for $25. Not any $100 room. We enjoyed it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, he said, they attempted to increase their stake by
playing blackjack at the town's casinos. But mainly they hung out.
``We'd go bowl 10 games at a time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday afternoon, they were making their way back to their
room at the Showboat Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center with a
takeout meal from Taco Bell when they were intercepted by police
for an expired license plate.
</P>
<P>
   They were still driving the Jeep Grand Cherokee stolen from the
Amarillo dealership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about running for it,'' he said. ``I told Shannon to
play it cool. She was scared. She grabbed my hand. I could tell the
cops recognized me. When they told me to step out of the car, I
knew it was over. He was reaching for his gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't let me kiss her goodbye,'' he said. ``They
cuffed me and then got her out of the car and cuffed her.''
</P>
<P>
   They were put in separate patrol cars. ``She said, ``I love
you.' I said, `I love you, too.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see there was a tear rolling down her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then they took her away.''

HOUSE VOTES TO SCRAP TAX SYSTEM AND DEVISE A NEW ONE  
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of rhetoric about the complexities and
inequities in the tax code, the House on Wednesday took a dramatic
though almost wholly symbolic step toward doing something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 219-209 to require that Congress come up with a
new tax system by Independence Day 2002 and to scrap the current
code by the end of that year.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, largely along party lines, was a victory for
Republicans who have spent years expressing and cultivating
unhappiness with the tax laws and the Internal Revenue Service. It
was assailed by President Clinton and Democrats as an election-year
ploy that risked throwing the nation into economic chaos while
avoiding any hard choices about what a new tax system would look
like.
</P>
<P>
   Because the White House has threatened to veto the measure, it
will almost certainly not become law even if it passes the Senate,
where its prospects are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote gave Republicans a boost in their efforts to build
support for alternatives to the progressive income tax: a
single-rate flat tax, perhaps, or a national sales tax. And during
the congressional election campaign this fall, Republicans are
certain to try to use the vote to paint Democrats as defenders of a
555-million-word set of laws and regulations that gives taxpayers a
headache.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have today is a monstrosity,'' said Speaker Newt
Gingrich, who ticked off statistics about the burdens imposed on
businesses and individuals by the current system, including $200
billion a year spent on accountants, lawyers and other costs of
complying, 8 billion pages a year of forms filed and 5.4 billion
hours spent working on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is a very important step in the right direction,''
Gingrich said as he accepted petitions from the National Federation
of Independent Business, the small business lobbying group,
containing 750,000 signatures calling for an end to the current tax
system.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are generally united in their belief that pushing to
throw out the current code is both good policy and good politics,
and at the heart of the bill passed Wednesday was the notion that
setting a specific deadline is the best way to force action.
</P>
<P>
   It calls for a national dialogue on creating a new, unspecified
system that is ``fairer, less complicated and less burdensome to
working Americans.'' It was watered down somewhat from its original
form, which did not provide for putting any new system in place
before terminating the existing code and called for the current
system to be scrapped at the end of 2001 instead of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their general fervor on the issue, Republicans have
been unable to agree among themselves on a specific replacement.
</P>
<P>
   One camp, led by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the majority leader,
and Steve Forbes, who made the issue the centerpiece of his 1996
presidential run, favor a flat tax. They claim their approach would
be simpler and enable almost everyone to pay taxes at a lower rate,
although at the cost of eliminating many popular tax breaks, in
some cases including the mortgage-interest deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Another camp, which includes Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the
chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, is leaning toward some
kind of national sales or consumption tax system that would
eliminate the income tax altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said they supported improving the tax system or
considering a new approach. But they said it was reckless to kill
off the current code without having even begun a serious debate on
the alternatives, much less having worked out the substantial
complexities of managing a transition from one system to another.
</P>
<P>
   Without knowing for sure what tax system will be in place
several years down the road, they said, individuals would have
difficulty planning for decisions like home purchases, companies
would face uncertainty about investment decisions and the entire
economy could suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will ever live to see a more irresponsible
act,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who said the bill was
nothing more than a stunt for use against Democrats on the campaign
trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's pass a law to terminate cancer,'' Rangel said. ``If you
vote against it you support cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was in favor of simplifying the tax system and
had not ruled out any alternatives. But he said passage of the
House bill would be a bad mistake, increasing risks to the economy
at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing in the world we need to do right now is to send
some signal of instability that we've decided to get rid of our
whole tax code without knowing what to replace it with,'' Clinton
said. &QL;

ASSAULT WEAPONS BILL SEEMS HEADED FOR PASSAGE IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A bill to ban assault weapons in Massachusetts is
expected to be OK'd by lawmakers in the House Thursday, but not
before an expected battle over whether to close some politically
sensitive loopholes in the law.
</P>
<P>
   One amendment that may be approved by the smallest of margins
would prevent current owners of high-capacity guns to resell them.
The other proposed change _ which is more likely to pass _ would
prevent felons from purchasing rifles and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an extremely tough vote for people to say `No, I'm
going to work for the rights of convicted felons.' That's the kind
of vote that will come back to haunt you time and time again if you
run for any statewide office,'' said state Senator Cheryl A.
Jacques, a Needham Democrat and supporter of an outright ban.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci _ who, with former governor
William F. Weld, has filed four assault weapons bills over the
years _ Wednesday said he would call legislators and ask them to
support the measure. However, no Republicans voted for the ban when
it passed the Senate last fall and it remains to be seen whether
Cellucci can deliver any GOP votes in the House. Former senator
Jane Swift, a North Adams Republican whom Cellucci chose as his
running mate, was an ardent opponent of a ban. She now favors it.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate bills are similar, except that the House
version allows felons to purchase rifles and shotguns five years
after being released from prison and it would allow current assault
weapon owners to resell them.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci Wednesday indirectly blamed House Speaker Thomas M.
Finneran _ not Republicans _ for the Legislature's failure to pass
an assault weapons ban by now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago, the assault weapons ban was a victim of
legislative hijinks. We already know there's a difference between
the Senate and House (versions). My hope is that the House and the
Senate, when they have a conference committee, this time around it
will be a real conference committee that will legitimately resolve
the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci was referring to earlier weapons-ban bills passed in
1996 by the House and Senate that died in conference committee when
then-speaker Charles Flaherty was forced to resign and Finneran was
voted to succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Senate again passed legislation banning
semi-automatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition
magazines, which hold more than 10 rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Joint Commmittee on Public Safety released the
bill the House is taking up. That legislation, like the Senate
version, has a child-access-prevention statute requiring safe
storage of guns and increasing penalties for usage of guns in
certain situations.
</P>
<P>
   Currently in Massachusetts, a convicted felon is prohibited for
life from getting a handgun; however, five years after release from
prison, a convicted felon can legally obtain a rifle or shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Also, any assault weapons made before 1994 can still be traded
on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   While the Senate bill closed those loopholes, the House version
does not.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill was stuck in the House Ways and Means Committee
for the past eight months, despite an ongoing effort by proponents
to move the legislation to the House.
</P>
<P>
   But Finneran, feeling political pressure to get it passed,
agreed to have a vote by mid-June. Neither Finneran nor his
spokesman could be reached for comment Wednesday.

MAN WINS $4.25 MILLION JUDGMENT AGAINST TELECOM COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A Texas man who worked on telecommunications
deals in Africa has won a $4.25 million judgment against his former
employer, which he said fired him to avoid paying his commission on
a $38.2 million Ivory Coast deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an example of corporate America at its worst,'' said
Lyndell Kirkley, one of several Fort Worth attorneys who
represented Jose Mendoza of Mineral Wells in his suit against
Comsat.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Bethesda, Md., Comsat is an international satellite
corporation that until June 1997 owned two professional sports
teams, the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association
and the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza sued Comsat in federal court in Fort Worth. U.S.
District Judge Terry Means entered a final judgment in the case
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   During a three-week trial in March, a jury found that Mendoza
was the ``procuring cause'' of the $38.2 million sale, meaning that
the deal resulted from his work but that Comsat hindered completion
of it and then fired him.
</P>
<P>
   The jury awarded Mendoza $1 million, but Means increased that
amount to about $3 million plus more than $1 million in interest,
because the judge concluded that jurors had calculated damages
incorrectly.
</P>
<P>
   Comsat plans to appeal on several issues, including the judge's
decision to increase the damage award, said Pat Long, a Dallas
attorney for the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the jury verdict is going to stand up, the most should be
the $1 million found by the jury,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Long added, ``we don't believe we have any liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit also alleges that Comsat engaged in a conspiracy with
two high-powered Washington lawyers, Ivory Coast government
officials and the man hired to replace Mendoza. Jurors did not find
that a conspiracy took place.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence presented during trial indicated that the lawyers, John
P. Sears and Joel Hoppenstein, were behind Mendoza's ouster and
benefited financially from it. Sears served as campaign manager for
Presidents Nixon and Reagan. Hoppenstein worked for Sears' firm.
</P>
<P>
   Trial testimony also indicated that high-placed Ivory Coast
government officials profited _ violating, Mendoza alleged, the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   Comsat acknowledged that the Washington lawyers and foreign
government officials profited, at least indirectly. The company
maintained that there was nothing inappropriate about those
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Comsat hired Mendoza to promote its telecommunications
products and service in several African countries, including the
Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In fall 1988, Mendoza appeared close to striking a deal for a
domestic satellite system. The system included ``Earth stations''
to receive and transmit signals, communications systems for police
and the U.S. Embassy, and radio, television and telephone systems.
</P>
<P>
   But before the deal was finalized, Comsat fired Mendoza, who
would have received an 8 percent commission, and hired an Ivorian
named Loum Diagne. Comsat maintained that it dismissed Mendoza
because he couldn't close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just concluded the deal was dead,'' Long said. ``It took a
change of government and different circumstances in the government
to revive the deal'' more than a year after Mendoza's firing.
</P>
<P>
   The suit _ argued by Kirkley and fellow attorneys Larry Cotten
and David Broiles _ contended that Mendoza was fired to save the
company about half the cost of his commission. The rest was spread
around to the two Washington lawyers, Diagne, and, indirectly,
high-placed Ivorian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Comsat acknowledged that Mendoza was fired and Diagne hired at
the suggestion of Sears and Hoppenstein, who had a business
relationship with Diagne. Diagne and the two lawyers had planned to
construct an office building in the Ivory Coast, but the project
was unsuccessful because Diagne had problems with the title to the
property, the suit states. That left Diagne indebted to Sears and
Hoppenstein.
</P>
<P>
   After Comsat hired Diagne, the company paid the two lawyers
$250,000 and awarded a $729,000 construction contract for the Ivory
Coast project to Diplomatic Security Inc., a firm with which the
lawyers were affiliated, according to trial evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Diagne was also president of a company called La Financiere,
whose investors and shareholders included high-placed Ivorian
government officials. About $611,000 of the $769,000 Comsat paid
Diagne was turned over to La Financiere.

DAVIS SAYS HE LOOKS FORWARD TO A BOOST FROM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ California Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democratic
nominee for governor of the Golden State, said Wednesday he will be
``proud to campaign'' with President Clinton despite controversies
that continue to dog the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the White House after an Oval Office meeting with
Clinton, Davis told reporters the president ``has literally
transformed peoples' lives in this country.'' At a meeting last
weekend in California the president committed himself to joining
Davis on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, standing with his wife Sharon, brushed aside a reporter's
question about whether Clinton would be an asset, given Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr's Whitewater and Monica Lewinsky probes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Davis replied, ``In California just four years ago,
people were complaining that the equity was declining in their
homes (and that) children were moving back in with them when they
graduated from college because no jobs were available. All that has
changed, and a good share of the credit belongs to this
administration. So I am proud to campaign with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Davis said, he won a commitment from Vice President
Al Gore to make campaign appearances. The dates and locations of
appearances with Clinton and Gore are being worked out, he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the Oval Office, Davis said, he and Clinton discussed the
president's education proposals, including one to spend $12 billion
over seven years to hire an extra 100,000 teachers and another to
allow federal backing for $22 billion in interest-free bonds for
school construction and repairs. He also applauded Clinton's
decision in Monterey, Calif., last weekend to extend until 2012 an
oil-drilling ban off parts of California's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Davis wrapped up a three-day swing through Washington in which
he met with California's 29-member Democratic congressional
delegation, which issued a letter backing him for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Among others he saw here were Gore; Colorado Gov. Roy Romer,
chairman of the Democratic National Committee; Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gerard McEntee, president of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   He said Democratic leaders in Washington are ``pumped'' over his
victory in the June 2 primary over party rivals Rep. Jane Harman
and wealthy businessman Al Checchi.
</P>
<P>
   ``California has been a constant source of divisive wedge
issues,'' he said, noting that many Democrats and allied interest
groups in Washington have devoted a lot of ``money and personal
attention'' to those issues.

<P>
   Without mentioning the name of Republican Pete Wilson, Davis
took a swipe at the current governor for backing such controversial
ballot initiatives as Proposition 187, which in 1994 barred most
social services and education to undocumented immigrants, and
Proposition 209, which in 1996 ended affirmative action in state
hiring, contracting and admissions to public colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington interests,'' Davis said, would ``very much welcome
a governor who is positive, inclusive and forward-looking (and who)
will not put on the ballot a series of divisive issues that have
drained the treasuries and occupied the attention (of the Democrats
and allied groups).''
</P>
<P>
   Davis also said he and his Republican opponent, California
Attorney General Dan Lungren, have agreed to five debates _ one
each in July and August and the remaining three after Labor Day.

BEYOND NEUTRA: A RESTORATION PAYS HOMAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By JOSEPH GIOVANNINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Back in the 1930s, the running joke among young
architects in the office of Richard Neutra, the apostle of
modernism, was: ``What is the best material to build a steel house
of?''
</P>
<P>
   Neutra believed steel could advance the cause of mass-produced
construction: True modernism demanded industrial materials. But he
was obsessed with steel in a low-rise city of wood construction.
(When steel wasn't in the budget, he sometimes just painted the
wood silver; it was hard to tell, anyhow, in black-and-white
photographs.)
</P>
<P>
   To judge by a new steel-and-glass addition to a just-restored
Neutra house in Santa Monica, it's taken about 60 years for
technology to catch up with his vision. In 1938, Neutra designed a
narrow six-bedroom beach house; though the long building and its
bay window echo the body and prow of an ocean liner, the structure
itself was conventional: stucco troweled over stud walls.
</P>
<P>
   In most of Neutra's budgets, technology was a financial stretch,
but today it is an increasingly common means to uncommon ends. For
the addition to Neutra's beach house, the Los Angeles architect
Steven Ehrlich designed a new structure that is next to not there.
Neutra built a solid; technology helped Ehrlich create a vaulted
void.
</P>
<P>
   Neutra originally designed the house for Albert Lewin, head of
the story department at MGM under Irving Thalberg. The staging of
the house was cinematic _ drums roll as guests enter through a
long, narrow Eden. The curved stairway, which Ehrlich has
refurbished with a sweeping stainless steel handrail, was reason
enough for Mae West to buy the house: What suits a living legend
most is a curved, flattering white wall.
</P>
<P>
   The glamorous staircase faces the flowing spaces of the dining
and living rooms, and the sequence climaxes in a semicircular bay
front with wraparound windows. The slim property allowed Neutra
most of his design opportunities on the beach facade, where the
house erupts in the crisp, semicircular bay, a signature form in
this classic early Neutra work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The house never suffered the onslaught of a major internal
reconfiguration,'' Ehrlich said. ``All the owners kept the original
proportions of the rooms and even the materials _ the black
linoleum in the kitchen and the yellow and gray opaque glass in the
bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   The current owners, a couple in their 40s who entertain
frequently, bought the house 10 years ago, but it was not until the
empty lot next door became available three years ago that they
called on Ehrlich. They needed space for guests and a family
entertainment room where, they said, they could kick off their
shoes. The Neutra house also had to be refreshed, and the swimming
pool relocated. The challenge was that a long side facade, never
intended to be seen, would become a principal feature of the
extended property.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich was self-effacing in the Neutra house: He replicated
gutters and rainspouts; he stained the hardwood floors white,
setting the furniture afloat. His main task was to add garage
space, and guest and staff quarters, while giving the structure a
new orientation to the side yard, where the family pavilion would
be located.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich's solution at the front of the property was a collage of
old and new. By expanding the garage along the street and adding
above a 1,400-square-foot second floor for the guest and staff
areas, he deployed the expansion as a tall fence protecting the
yard from the high-speed Pacific Coast Highway out front.
</P>
<P>
   If overscaled for the fragile dimensions of the original house,
the pumped-up extension helps define a large garden, which Ehrlich
_ who has admired indigenous courtyard houses during travels
through North and West Africa _ developed into a protected
precinct. ``A courtyard helps a house become a retreat,'' he said.
``I was giving a primitive idea a modern voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The L-shaped configuration created an inner sanctum large enough
for a freestanding, 1,200-square-foot pavilion that serves as
family room, party space and poolside cabana. The house and
perimeter walls, a band of privacy around the property, allowed the
pavilion to be transparent.
</P>
<P>
   The addition, connected to the house by a glass tunnel, gives
the illusion of opening up to the Neutra building as much as it
does to the beach. But by being close to the house, the pavilion
actually masks a repetitious facade that is not as interesting as
the Neutra myth would have it, a myth the architect cultivated
during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Neutra's long white boat of a building stands near a
pavilion whose design fulfills the vision Neutra didn't always get
to build. Ehrlich updated the steel frame Neutra favored with
perforated, sound-absorbent metal ceilings, long stretches of
stainless steel cupboards and butted glass planes.
</P>
<P>
   At the touch of a button, a stainless steel gate in the garden
wall rolls back to reveal the beach. Although Neutra would have
been fascinated by the new materials and gadgetry, he would have
recognized that the new technology gets architecture no closer to
his ideal of building for the masses. Early modernism, high-tech
and even Neutra himself have become expensive collectibles.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Neutra's bay window, Ehrlich devised a dynamic roof
with a flattened curve poised delicately on a steel frame. The
beams _ in a reference to a favorite Neutra detail _ stretch like
outriggers to columns placed outside the glass walls. The roof acts
like a parasol for a room whose real walls are the garden fence. At
either end, glass walls slide back, opening the interior to the
outside _ as in the most-generous Neutra houses, where living room
floors blend into carpets of grass.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion, the pool and the gate facing the beach align along
an axis. From the pavilion, the mind and eye skip like a stone from
the pool to the sand to the ocean. ``I'd like to think the
pavilion, with the new materials and the evaporating glass walls,
takes Neutra's ideas a step further,'' Ehrlich said. ``It's much
more minimal than he was ever able to achieve in those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just how do you build next to a serious piece of
architecture?'' Ehrlich asked. ``My sense is that you honor the
architect and make him proud by doing something new that relates to
the original.''

BOSSES AND TOP LIEUTENANTS DIFFER, SURVEY SHOWS
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chief executives and their top lieutenants need to have a long
talk.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey by the Association of Executive Search Consultants
shows widely divergent views between the two camps on issues like
succession and training for the top job.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, for example, shows 57 percent of senior executives
identified by search firms as ``future CEOs'' think they will have
to go to another company to get the top job. By contrast,
two-thirds of current chief executives believe their successors
will be promoted from within.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem may be what the future chief executives see
as ``successor sabotage'' _ almost half said it was not uncommon
for chief executives, reluctant to step down, to criticize possible
successors within the company to the board, dashing the chances of
internal candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the problem may be different perceptions about
the quality of executive training. More than three-quarters of
current chief executives said they felt they played an active role
in development training, but most senior and human resource
executives disagreed, and said the chief executives needed to be
more involved in training.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a perception on the part of the CEOs that they are
doing an adequate job getting to the next level down,'' said John
Lloyd, chairman of the association and vice chairman of the
Witt/Kieffer executive search firm. ``But there is a disparate view
from young and up-and-coming executives, who want to be more than a
passive bystander.''
</P>
<P>
   The association, which includes 160 executive search firms
nationwide, surveyed three groups of executives in March and April
_ 100 chief executives, 100 ``future CEOs'' and 100 human-resource
executives. They represented a broad range of industries, and on
average the annual sales of their companies were $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   _ At least two-thirds of each group said that the rise of the
``portable CEO,'' who jumps from company to company and industry to
industry, had had a negative impact on loyalty throughout corporate
America. At the same time, the executives said such jumps were not
a stretch for their skills _ about 80 percent over all said that
effective chief executives need not come from within a company's
industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Higher turnover among chief executives has resulted largely
from increased shareholder pressure for immediate results, most
executives said, adding that such pressure has hampered their
ability to serve others with a stake, such as employees and
communities. Many believe the rate of chief-executive turnover will
increase.
</P>
<P>
   _ A slight majority of all three groups surveyed also said
international experience was not a prerequisite to becoming a chief
executive. But to those who are considering going abroad, the
Asia-Pacific region was cited most frequently as the best training
ground.
</P>
<P>
   _ All the effort required to get to the top spot is not worth it
to some. A clear majority of all three groups said they knew
somebody in an upper management position who had opted out of
corporate America, and that they had considered doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   Most senior and human resource executives believe the phenomenon
of opting out will grow over the next decade. &QL;

BOWMAN AND WINGS KEEP MOTOWN BEAT GOING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two days before the Stanley Cup finals began, coach
Scotty Bowman brought his Detroit Red Wings onto the ice at Joe
Louis Arena in Detroit early on a Sunday morning. Game 1 was still
more than 48 hours away, and it could have been a sloppy, unfocused
practice. Gathering his mostly veteran champions in a circle at
center ice, Bowman began to bark out instructions for a new drill.
Everyone, even in the seats, could hear every word. But in their
totality, the instructions were disjointed and made little sense.
Confused, the players tried the new drill and messed it up.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman quickly brought them back into the circle. He yelled some
more, in a louder voice, while gesturing with his hands and hockey
stick. But it was still difficult to comprehend what he wanted.
After the players bungled the drill again, Bowman blew his whistle
with a shrill blast, brought them together a third time and yelled
even more. Finally, the players began to snarl at one another.
Everyone seemed irked and on edge. Bowman then ordered a different
drill, one of the old drills, one which the players knew well. They
executed it perfectly, with intense focus.
</P>
<P>
   In five quick minutes, Bowman had got everyone's attention and
had charged the practice with sharp, nervous energy.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings won't practice again until September, when they
report to training camp. They guaranteed this Tuesday night at MCI
Center when they defeated the Capitals by 4-1 to complete a
four-game sweep of the Stanley Cup finals. It was Detroit's second
consecutive championship and the fourth season in succession that
the last round of the National Hockey League's postseason
tournament has ended in a sweep. And it was another of Bowman's
many triumphant moments, his eighth Stanley Cup as a coach, tying
him with Toe Blake, his mentor, who won eight with Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman has won five as coach of the Canadiens, one as coach of
Pittsburgh, and two with Detroit. He also won a ring with
Pittsburgh as a front-office executive. This was Bowman's 12th trip
to the finals. His first was 30 years ago, in 1968, when his
expansion St. Louis Blues lost in a four-game sweep to Blake's
Canadiens. Cerebral, demanding, churlish and intuitive, Bowman is
not a charm-school coach. Through generations of athletes, he has
changed some of his tactics while maintaining his inscrutable aura
and air of authority. Igor Larionov, a Detroit veteran who admires
him, calls Bowman ``the conductor of a big orchestra.'' With a
hockey stick as his figurative baton, Bowman has them all on key
and in tempo.
</P>
<P>
   With three trips to the finals in the last four springs, the
late 1990s have swung to a Motown beat. Sergei Fedorov, somewhat
less enamored with Bowman than Larionov, admits the coach ``can
read the game when nobody is certain what is going to happen
next.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we agree,'' Fedorov said. ``Sometimes we disagree.
But it is part of the learning experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Now age 64, it is not certain that Professor Bowman will be back
next season to try for three in a row and to break Blake's record.
He has a year left on his contract, at his option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a tough decision not to come back,'' Bowman
said. ``I realize that. But I've got to leave sometime. I want to
make sure I'm leaving at the right time when I do leave.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ken Holland, the Detroit general manager, said earlier this week
that he expects Bowman to return. Without a team to coach, Holland
said, Bowman would be bored by mid-September. Bowman said he would
wait until the emotion calms down to make and announce his
decision. It will take a few weeks for the emotion of Tuesday night
to wear off.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the emotion will still be visible on Thursday, however,
when Detroit _ which calls itself Hockeytown _ will greet the Wings
on their parade down Woodward Avenue to Hart Plaza on the downtown
riverfront. It is possible that the parade will include Vladimir
Konstantinov, the injured defenseman, who attended Tuesday night's
clincher and led the on-ice procession with the silver trophy in
his wheelchair. One of the team's top players last spring,
Konstantinov and the Wings' masseur, Sergei Manatsakanov, suffered
serious brain damage in a crash of their limousine last June 13,
six days after the cup was won.
</P>
<P>
   Before Konstantinov was wheeled onto the ice Tuesday night, he
watched the game from a landing about 20 rows behind one of the
nets. During a timeout, he stood, with help from his wife, to wave
and greet the fans who were cheering him. The Wings players,
standing in front of their bench, heard the noise, saw their
red-clad teammate and responded by tapping their sticks on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole bench came unglued,'' Brendan Shanahan said. ``We
were screaming and yelling. Scotty tried to calm us down because we
still had a period to play. But there was no way. There wasn't a
dry eye on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman smiled and shook his head afterward at the memory. ``It
just went right through the whole bench,'' he said, adding that he
was concerned because the game still had about 16 minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   There are some situations even Bowman can't control. But his
team contained the Capitals with no further scoring. Doug Brown got
two of the goals Tuesday. Steve Yzerman, the captain, won the Conn
Smythe trophy as most valuable player in the postseason. Yzerman,
after accepting the cup, handed it directly to Konstantinov, at the
suggestion of Shanahan. On the ice and in the locker room, the
players kept gathering around Konstantinov. Slava Fetisov said
``Vladdie's spirit'' was with the team all season. Shanahan said
the moment ``transcended sports.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reprise of the team theme song from last season, Larionov
sang softly in Konstantinov's ear ``We are the champions ...'' and
Konstantinov answered `` ... my friend.''

 IN `KUDZU,' THE SOUTH LEARNS ABOUT ITSELF
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Not everyone who lives in the South, who was born
in the lee of a kudzu-ensnarled water tower on a road where filling
stations advertise barbecue and worms in the same breath and the
hard-headed mechanic works only on American cars, actually loves
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, people have to learn to love it, to love their place
in it long after fate or fortune tugs them away from a world where
the hounds sleep like the dead between the oil-stained boots of old
men and the local newspaper comes out every Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That, give or take a half-dozen subplots, is the message in
``Kudzu,'' the musical comedy based on the comic strip of the same
name by Doug Marlette, a Pulitzer Prize-winning political
cartoonist who grew up in North Carolina in places like the
mythical town of Bypass, the setting for his strip and the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kudzu,'' playing through June here in Ford's Theater _ the
place where John Wilkes Booth put a bullet in President Abraham
Lincoln's brain during a production of ``Our American Cousin'' on
April 14, 1865 _ is the story of a weed and a boy of the same name,
an 18-year-old would-be writer named Kudzu Dubose.
</P>
<P>
   One of them _ that would be the weed _ prospers in the red clay
as the other tries in vain to snip and clip and otherwise stop its
insidious spread even as his own life seems hopelessly bound by
small-town inertia, by a slow pace of life that is threatened when
the town's evil leading citizen, Big Bubba Tadsworth, tries to sell
the very soul of the tiny hamlet to Japanese investors. The
Japanese, as the plot goes, want to make it the world headquarters
of their company, ``the world's largest manufacturer of American
flags.''
</P>
<P>
   The show ``touches a very strong emotional cord, not only of
what it means to be Southern but what it means to feel isolated,
far from the centers where power and wealth lie,'' said William
Ferris, a Mississippian and the chairman of the National Endowment
for the Arts. ``But deep below the vines of kudzu is a magical
world, and the show evokes both the sad and the beautiful parts of
that world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we approach the millennium, you become increasingly aware
that these worlds are quite precious.''
</P>
<P>
   The mythical Bypass got its name because when the state built
its big, new highway it forgot to give the town an exit. So, as the
show explains, the world just passes Bypass by, as everyone from
Kudzu to the Rev. Will B. Dunn, the ambitious preacher, dream of
trading their little town _ ``a place so backward even the
Episcopalians handle snakes'' _ for something grander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get weepy when I see it, because it is my story and the
story of every artist born in a small town or provincial city,''
said Pat Conroy, the best-selling author of ``The Prince of Tides''
and other books about Southerners. ``No matter how good we are, we
all have the fear we're not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Southerners blame the very place that nurtured them, that made
them, he said. ``William Faulkner, Thomas Wolfe, Eudora Welty, all
knew about it, about having to learn to love the South,'' said
Conroy, who is a close friend of Marlette.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the musical, powered by the guitars, fiddles and piano of
the Red Clay Ramblers, an eclectic band that began in weekend jam
sessions in a North Carolina cabin but has performed around the
world and on Broadway, is also a love story about the South, said
the people who have seen it and can identify with the region.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players, Kudzu's grease-spotted Uncle Dub, the town
mechanic, is the community's voice of restraint, a man who is
content with himself and his town. Kudzu, wanting to go off to the
big city to be a writer, is torn between that force of good and
that of Big Bubba, whose daughter _ the shallow and vapid but
beautiful Veranda _ has stolen Kudzu's heart.
</P>
<P>
   As the play unfolds, the audience wonders whether Kudzu _ who
turns out to be the unexpected owner of the property Big Bubba
wants for himself for the Japanese-owned American flag factory _
discovers the value in his town and himself. There are references
to luring Mercedes plants and other foreign investors, pulled
straight from real headlines, as the boy decides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you hate when opportunity knocks, and folks act like
their heads is made out of blocks,'' argues the character Big
Bubba, played by Roger Howell, a Mississippian. ``They just stand
there, watching it fade. But a man like me, I take the opposite
tack. I'll buy it from you, paint it and sell it right back. That's
why you're you. But me, I got it made.''
</P>
<P>
   Small towns, desperate for an economic base, face such decisions
routinely. But in real life, jobs almost always win out over
memories and history. ``What's the price worth paying?'' said John
Shelton Reed, professor of sociology at the University of North
Carolina, who has seen the play several times. ``Can you get decent
jobs without selling your soul for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, he said, ``could be kind of grim'' if that was all it
was about.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also about barbecue sauce _ an unexpected shortage
throws the town into a panic _ and hound dogs and unrequited love,
as Kudzu longs after the pom-pom shaking Veranda, who chides him
with: ``Why don't you call me? Everybody else does.''
</P>
<P>
   It is about strong mothers and absent fathers _ Kudzu's daddy is
a traveling trampoline salesman who disappeared 17 years ago _ and
music and religion and impossible dreams. One of Kudzu's friends,
Nasal T. Lardbottom, is so uncoordinated he cannot even connect on
a high-five, but still dreams about leaping up for rim-shattering
slam dunks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lets face it,'' the character says, in a moment of doubt.
``Ain't nobody ever gonna name a sneaker after Nasal T.
Lardbottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlette, who wrote the show with two friends, Jack Herrick and
Bland Simpson, both members of Red Clay Ramblers, got to see
something most cartoonists do not. He saw his characters take on
flesh and blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``was a joy.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes people laugh at the jokes and situations even as they
get the deeper meaning behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the South, where we're from, where
America seems to come into itself,'' said Marlette, who divides his
time between New York and Hillsborough, N.C. ``The Civil War was
fought on Southern soil and the civil rights movement. And now the
economic energy has shifted south. There's something about our part
of the world that makes America discover its deepest convictions.
Its soul is worked out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The character Kudzu embodies all that, Marlette said, and has to
decide if ``all the things that he sees as bad about himself are
actually the things that are special about him, wonderful about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It took years to put together, but crowds have been large and
steady as the show nears the end of its Washington run at the end
of June.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, Marlette, the political cartoonist for Newsday, is
still not sure what to call it, whether musical or show or theater.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will just call it his story, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own personal myth,'' he said.

   JERUSALEM _ Two Israeli teen-agers living in a hostel for
troubled youths in a Jewish settlement near Hebron were jailed
Wednesday after a Palestinian farmer was killed on a West Bank
roadside when they hit him with a wooden pole from a passing van.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian, Abdel Majid Abu Turki, 47, a father of 10, was
attacked on Tuesday near the settlement of Beit Haggai, and details
of the incident emerged Wednesday as a Jerusalem court ordered the
16-year-old suspects held for six days pending charges.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-agers, who appeared in court with their heads hidden by
Jewish prayer shawls, had confessed to the killing earlier and
re-enacted it with police investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The murder is a shocking murder and we can't accept it,''
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters. ``Whoever
committed this terrible act will be prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Tibi, an adviser to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader,
attributed the slaying to ``terrible incitement against the
Palestinians'' by Jewish settlers, and he urged directors of the
hostel to ``examine the education they are giving these youths.''
</P>
<P>
   Tareq Zeid, commander of Palestinian forces in Hebron, called
the killing an example of ``Israeli policies of continuous and
daily attacks'' on Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli police said the teen-agers killed Abu Turki with a
wooden pole they had thrust out of a van as they rode to Beit
Haggai.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Turki's relatives said he had been walking home from his
plot of land with three other men when he was smashed on the back
of the neck from a speeding vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a murder,'' said Commander Moshe Ariel, the
chief investigating officer for the Israeli Police in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the director of the hostel, Efraim Hibsh, described the
incident differently. ``This was a prank that ended tragically when
Abu Turki met his death,'' Hibsh said in a radio interview. ``He is
our neighbor, he worked here and we know him. Beit Haggai condemns
the improper phenomenon of harming innocent people, Jews or
Arabs.''
</P>
<P>
   Hibsh noted that the teen-agers were taken to the police by
hostel administrators on Tuesday night after they learned of the
killing from press reports. He rejected accusations by Israeli
peace groups that the teen-agers had drawn inspiration from
anti-Arab views promoted by educators and rabbis in Jewish
settlements. ``We see nothing wrong with the way we are
educating,'' he said. ``We remain faithful to our path.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostel in Beit Haggai provides housing, schooling,
counseling and vocational training for 50 teen-age dropouts and
delinquents. The two suspects were wards of the state, and one had
a police record, said their lawyer, Naftali Wurtzburger.

CLINTON ORDERS U.S. INTERVENTION TO BOLSTER JAPANESE ECONOMY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton abandoned his arms' length
approach to the Asian financial crisis Wednesday and ordered U.S.
intervention in global currency markets in a bid to spark the
Japanese economy _ the second largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. intervention took the form of selling $2 billion in
dollars to buy yen, cutting the value of the dollar against the
yen. Japan also sold $2 billion in dollars to buy yen.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinated maneuver reduced the value of the dollar by 4.8
percent against the yen, thereby bolstering the value of such
yen-based businesses as the Japanese banks that make loans
throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Clinton ordered the unusual
step because of deepening U.S. concern that Japan's stubborn
recession could drag down teetering Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   The free falling yen threatened to make Japanese products less
expensive on the world market, thereby undercutting the exports of
other nations, including the United States and Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said Clinton acted because if a major financial crisis
were to develop in Asia, ``then the effects on our nation could be
severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin added: ``It is precisely to avoid that, that the United
States has ... taken action.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also dispatched an emergency team to Tokyo to confer
with Japanese counterparts, including Deputy Treasury Secretary
Larry Summers, William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York that handles U.S. government overseas
transactions, in addition to State Department specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said it was the first time during the Clinton
presidency that the United States has sold U.S. currency to reduce
its value in order to boost a foreign currency. The Clinton
administration used a related maneuver in August 1995 to prop up
the U.S. dollar by buying dollars in worldwide currency markets and
selling yen in an effort to bolster the value of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the action as he prepares for a 10-day visit to
China starting next week. This will be the first visit there by an
American president since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre of
pro-democracy demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange rose in response to
the Clinton administration's actions. The Dow Jones industrial
average closed up 164.17 at 8,829.46 two days after tumbling 207
points due to concern about the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the expansion of the stalled Japanese economy
remains ``very important to keeping our own economic progress
going,'' adding: ``We've got a chance to turn that situation in
Asia around before it gets any worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the 10-month Asian financial crisis that began in
Thailand has cost the U.S. economy an estimated $23 billion in lost
exports in the first quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic expansion, now in its 79th month, is the
third longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ordered the intervention following a White House meeting
Tuesday with Rubin, national security adviser Samuel ``Sandy''
Berger, national economic adviser Gene Sperling and others.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto in a
15-minute telephone call at 11:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday evening that the
United States would move to bolster the Japanese yen if the
Japanese government took hard-nosed steps to stimulate the Japanese
economy, bail out troubled banks and deregulate the Japanese
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know whether what you do in all these things will
make a large difference,'' Clinton said during a Rose Garden
ceremony. ``But I wanted to send a clear signal to the markets that
the United States supports Japanese reform, believes the Japanese
people can pull out of this economic slump and restore growth and
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin indicated that additional U.S. efforts to boost the
Japanese yen could be undertaken in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Clinton took the action in part to stem China's
threatened devaluation of the yuan in a bid to make Chinese exports
more competitive with Japanese exports. U.S. officials continued
their appeals for China to resist such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng warned in an article in
Tuesday's editions of The People's Daily, the Communist party
newspaper, that China could face increased ``pressure'' to cut the
value of the yuan unless Japan showed the ``courage and wisdom'' to
halt the downward spiral of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has an immense stake in the outcome of the
Asian financial crisis. Two-way U.S. trade with Asia accounts for
28.8 percent of U.S. worldwide commerce.
</P>
<P>
   The two-way U.S.-Japan trade of $187 billion accounts for almost
10 percent of all U.S. trade. Perhaps more importantly, Japan's
multi-billion dollar trade with Asian neighbors supports hundreds
of thousands of jobs across the Pacific Rim, including in China.

SPORTS COLUMN: TODAY'S GOLFERS FEAR NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AL BARKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a rare candid moment some years after the fact, the late Ben
Hogan recalled he had contributed to his own incredible playoff
loss to Jack Fleck in the 1955 U.S. Open, at San Francisco's
Olympic Club, where this year's Open begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On the second hole, Hogan had reached the green in regulation,
and was waiting there for Fleck while the obscure municipal course
pro struggled after a poor tee shot, taking considerable time to
play from deep rough and a bunker. When Fleck at last arrived on
the green, he said to Hogan, ``Sorry to keep you waiting.'' Hogan
replied, ``That's OK, we've got nothing else to do today.'' And
with that reply, Hogan reminisced, he gave up his edge, his
intimidation factor. Fleck won, 69-72.
</P>
<P>
   In Hogan's day, a champion player, by virtue of his record and
his manner of being as well, could cow a less-accomplished
opponent. Hogan, with his dour and silent mien, was an intimidator
supreme. Jack Nicklaus was not quite as grim, but his
self-absorption was palpable. Opponents felt he didn't know they
even existed. He did know, though, his effect on them. Nicklaus
once remarked that when in contention coming down the stretch he
had at least a stroke up on the others by simply being Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of thing doesn't prevail anymore, it appears. Today's
leading young players _ Tiger Woods, Justin Leonard, Ernie Els,
David Duval, Lee Westwood, et. al., simply are not afraid of
anything or anyone. They are not terrified by the significance of
an event, or the presence and previous accomplishments of other
players, especially the older, established ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt afraid of anyone out here, in golf,'' said
25-year-old Westwood, the current British hotshot.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? What makes the new generation of golfers so intrepid?
The former PGA champion Bob Tway is one of many who make the point
that today's young professionals experience so much high-quality
competition on high-quality courses as teens and in college that
coming onto the pro circuit is merely an extension of their golf
life. Many of the players have been playing each other for years.
So if intimidation is at least partly the product of dealing with
something new, what's to fear?
</P>
<P>
   Also, a large percentage of today's professional golfers come
from of a middle-class background. Their parents could afford to
provide them with professional instruction, perhaps membership in a
country club, the opportunity to travel, a college education and
the money to play the amateur golf circuit. Previous generations of
pros, in most cases, rose from less-fortunate economic situations.
Kids who come to big-time golf from more comfortable circumstances
simply feel at home, even deserving. Many of their predecessors
often got into golf as caddies, not a bad line of work for a young
person but one decidedly on the servant side of the spectrum. Poor
youngsters are more apt to be awed by the accoutrements of
well-being, at least when first encountered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Frank Nobilo, the New Zealander playing the American pro
circuit, is among those who feel the amount of money that can be
made in pro golf now is a component of fearlessness. ``You can make
so much now, in only one tournament, that it's leveled the playing
field,'' he said. ``Because you don't have to cut corners, be
overly careful as a player, you can take more chances.'' Nobilo
also points out that pros now ``have all the equipment experts out
here, swing gurus, psychologists, all there for us with the latest
and best information, so we don't have to hang around the old pros,
get their confidence, to get insights on the game and how to play
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Twitty believes today's clubs and balls have to no little
degree taken the artistry out of playing the game. Hence, there is
no call to watch the old timers play cut shots and draws and
knockdowns, and ask them how they do it. ``Technology has made so
much of the game so much easier,'' said Twitty. ``What with how far
the ball goes and how much less it curves in the air, and because
of the perfect grasses we play from, we don't need those finesse
shots anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe there is more to it than equipment technology and
economics. Perhaps there is something in the popular culture that
is putting no fear in the hearts of young athletes. Television, for
example. Past sports heroes were, in a way, mythological figures,
in part because they weren't actually seen that often. But with the
coming of television, and its extensive, not to say
small-screen-intimate coverage, kids can see for themselves that
major leaguers will bobble the easy grounder, strike out swinging
at a bad pitch, miss two free throws in a row, drop a pass in the
end zone, or watch in living color every excruciating moment as
Greg Norman fritters away a huge lead in the final round of the
Masters. Seeing the stars make mistakes has more impact than
reading about it.
</P>
<P>
   Take this a step further. On television, the normally
stone-faced Nick Faldo breaks down in tears upon winning a British
Open. Nothing wrong with grown men crying in emotional times, of
course, even when winning. Quite human, in fact. Which is the
point. It corroborates what Lee Westwood had drilled into him by
his school-teacher father: ``Dad said everyone puts their pants on
one leg at a time,'' Westwood said. ``The best players just make
fewer mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   So what is there to be intimidated by?

   While most of us aren't likely to go that far, every day we get
angry: At bosses, co-workers, employees, other drivers, our
spouses, our children.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors in the 1960s and '70s used to tell people to vent
their anger, and that anger created pressure that needed to be
released, said David Kupfer, a clinical psychologist in Falls
Church, Va., who specializes in anger control. Subsequent research
has shown that people who ``get it off their chest'' vociferously
actually feel worse. Constant complaining or sulking also indulges
anger rather than solves anything, Kupfer pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Now anger-management education helps people alter perceptions
and change behaviors. Often enough, counselors say, our anger stems
from an overblown interpretation of events. Or, we express
justifiable anger in a way that, over time, wrecks relationships
and makes life miserable.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first strategies of anger control is to become aware
of the physiology of anger, said Kirk McClelland, clinical social
worker at CenterPoint Counseling and Recovery in Kansas City. He
just completed a two-year domestic violence program with men.
</P>
<P>
   Once the men learn the physical cues of anger _ tightening of
the jaw and chest, increased heart rate and respiration _ they can
override them cognitively, McClelland said. They can force
themselves to stop, step back and take a time out to cool down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to help them learn that they're doing something that
takes a lot more courage than just moving into the battle,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That simple strategy can keep violence from occurring, said
McClelland, but then clients must work on the roots of their anger.
Many in the program were working-class men who felt inadequate and
unsuccessful and didn't see how to change their situations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   George Ronan, a clinical psychologist in Mount Pleasant, Mich.,
targets anger in his violence reduction program at Central Michigan
University. Clients often arrive thinking that anger and aggression
are the best options to maintain control of their situations and
other people, Ronan said.
</P>
<P>
   But their anger actually allows others to control them. A person
who loses his cool can be manipulated, Ronan said. Others can push
their buttons _ like the pool player who wanted to have a fun
Friday night but ended up in jail. Similarly, angry spouses, bosses
and workers find their real goals _ a nice weekend, a completed
project _ sidelined by hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hostility is our way of saying, `You're not going to get away
with mistreating me this way,' '' said Richard Driscoll, a clinical
psychologist in Knoxville, Tenn., who advises couples on anger
management.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most devastating episodes happen at home, between
husbands and wives. Driscoll spends a lot of time in his practice
teaching partners how to understand and express their anger.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their intimate relationship, spouses can inflict a
lot of damage on each other _ and their marriage. The angry
confrontations say ``straighten up and do me right or suffer my
wrath,'' Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 percent of married couples report ``physical
confrontation'' while angry at each other, including grabbing and
pushing, Driscoll said. About 3 percent say it escalates to serious
violence.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest mistakes partners make is to throw blanket
accusations at each other, he said, such as, ``You never listen to
me,'' or, ``You never want to have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll said people can manage their anger in several ways: by
changing how they talk about their grievances, by changing their
interpretation of events and by changing their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rationally assessing the situation, couples
eventually take to heart their own angry criticisms. Their
relationships become as shallow and empty as the bleak portraits
they've painted, no matter how inaccurate, Driscoll said.
</P>
<P>
   He teaches spouses not to say, ``You never listen to me,''
rather, ``I know you're tired after a long day, but I'm lost right
now and I need your attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Stop and think whether you've interpreted the situation fairly.
Did your spouse really come home late to purposely mess up the
dinner you had planned? Or, if getting home late is a source of
angry confrontations, can you redouble your efforts to leave on
time, or can you change your home schedule to more accurately
reflect work demands?
</P>
<P>
   ``If when you're angry you feel justified, remember you're not
so innocent,'' Driscoll said. ``You're contributing to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Become aware of how much your anger will harm someone you
love. It gives you reason to control it.''

MODERN MOUTH ROBS `MULAN' OF ITS UNIQUE VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT W. BUTLER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: When ``Mulan'' opens Friday on the nation's screens,
moviegoers will be treated to one of Walt Disney's best animated
films.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it might have been a great film, had its makers had a
little more faith in the subject matter and a lot less reliance on
formula.
</P>
<P>
   The good news: ``Mulan'' is visually spectacular, emotionally
resonant, narratively compelling and filled with cartoon characters
who, strangely enough, seem far more believable than most of the
flesh-and-blood actors populating today's movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our roots are still in the tradition of the Disney animated
classic,'' Mulan's director, Barry Cook, said in a recent telephone
interview. ``But a little at a time, we're getting away from those
elements and finding new ways of telling stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook and crew can be proud of what they've accomplished with
``Mulan,'' which more than any other recent Disney film seems
rooted in a particular time and place. It's based on an ancient
Chinese legend about a girl who disguises herself as a man and
joins the army in place of her aged father. To their credit, the
filmmakers have made a real effort to incorporate Chinese visual
motifs, Asian-American voices, and even elements of traditional
Chinese music.
</P>
<P>
   Cook credits one of the film's writers, Rita Hsiao, and many of
the voice talents for demanding a high degree of respect for a
story that is known all over Asia but which is unfamiliar to most
Americans. Among the voices are those of several prominent Asian
and Asian-American actors, including Ming-Na Wen, Lea Salonga, B.D.
Wong, George Takei, Gedde Watanabe, James Shigata and Pat Morita.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing they emphasized was their love of the tale,''
Cook said. ``The rest of us had never heard of it, but these
Asian-Americans had heard it as children. They had a love for the
character of Mulan coming into the project, and they transferred
that to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The results are, in most respects, spectacular. ``Mulan'' is so
good, in fact, that finding any fault with it puts the critic in
the unenviable position of throwing a wet blanket on everybody's
good time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, ``Mulan'' has one problem. In a film that is in
many ways is overwhelmingly Chinese, one character stands out as an
anachronism. The heroine Mulan is accompanied by an inept
pint-sized dragon named Mushu whose voice is provided by ... Eddie
Murphy?
</P>
<P>
   And not a restrained Eddie Murphy, either. No this is Eddie
Murphy in full-blown, African-American street hipster mode. He
cracks wise, spews exclamations and drops references reflecting
contemporary black humor.
</P>
<P>
   That Murphy is often quite funny in the film is not in question.
The problem is his approach is undeniably out of sync with the rest
of the effort, his glib outbursts at odds with the essentially
serious tone of this undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   Mushu doesn't ruin the movie. In fact, he'll probably prove to
be the most popular character with children and as such will sell a
lot of tickets _ and stuffed toys. But Murphy being cast in this
role reflects one of the more irritating elements in Disney's
animation formula.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell it's this: The inhabitants of the Mouse House seem
to have a deathly fear of letting a story find its own voice.
Whatever the elements that attract the filmmakers to a story in the
first place, they eventually will be forced through the Disney
mold, galvanized with the Disney formula to eliminate anything at
odds with the studio's homogeneous world view.
</P>
<P>
   This is hardly a new phenomenon. Even in the studio's first
animated feature, ``Snow White,'' the seven dwarfs were more Three
Stooges than Brothers Grimm. They were basically American stock
characters.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has been reasonably purist when dealing with British
subjects. The studio's ``Peter Pan,'' ``Sleeping Beauty,'' ``The
Great Mouse Detective,'' ``101 Dalmatians'' (the animated version)
and ``Beauty and the Beast'' actually took pleasure in reflecting
British attitudes, characters and humor.
</P>
<P>
   But let the setting get more exotic, and get ready for some
cultural whitewash. ``The Jungle Book'' may have taken place in
India, but the animal characters were so Damon Runyon, the famous
chronicler of Broadway street life, they could have been born
within a block of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was brought home most forcefully in ``The Lion
King.'' The story was set in Africa but, with the exception of the
baboon//shaman character and some African chanting in the opening
number, it was about as Afrocentric as a meeting of the Odd Fellows
lodge in Peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the attitudes, characters, songs and humor of ``The
Lion King'' reflected the sensibilities of white, middle-class
American suburbanites _ in other words, the people who made the
film as well as its biggest audience.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, when ``The Lion King'' found its way to the Broadway
stage, its visionary director//designer, Julie Taymor, emphasized
its African roots to a degree barely hinted at in the movie. As a
result of this, the stage ``Lion King'' is a real improvement on
the film, an escape into a totally original world.
</P>
<P>
   That ``Mulan'' often actually feels Chinese undoubtedly reflects
a shift in emphasis among Disney animators. But the powers that be
clearly are uncomfortable with following that to its logical
conclusion. After all, if ``Mulan'' were to seem too exotic, too
foreign, audiences might not warm up to it.
</P>
<P>
   So we can think of Eddie Murphy as a sort of box-office
insurance policy. His Mushu speaks in an idiom that American
audiences, especially kids, will immediately recognize.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain irony here: African-American culture has
become such a highly visible force in popular entertainment that
middle-class white kids immediately respond to it. On the one hand,
this represents social progress; on the other, black culture is now
so mainstream that it's considered ripe for co-opting by Disney.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand why the film's producers took this approach.
Robin Williams' manic whirlwind of a genie in ``Aladdin'' forever
changed Disney cartoons. Instead of humor for the ages, he dished
humor for the here and now, imitating Arnold Schwarzenegger, Rodney
Dangerfield, William F. Buckley and other contemporary cultural
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aladdin'' was trendy and topical, a cartoon absolutely aware
of its own cartoonishness and always joking about it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mulan,'' like ``Beauty and the Beast,'' is at heart a
serious dramatic story and evokes a much more delicate mood. It
deserves to find its true voice _ a Chinese voice _ undiluted by
Disney's ethnic mix-and-match recipe.

JOB WITH CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS JUST ANOTHER TURN ON MAN'S CAREER

   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ Tom Mitchell didn't seem to fit the
profile of a liquor store owner. He appeared a bit on the young
side to be either a business owner or a booze connoisseur.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, his operation always seemed both a thriving
enterprise and a place run with imagination and entrepreneurial
verve. That, at least, was the impression of a veteran observer of
establishments catering to the thirsty set.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Mitchell was indeed a different sort of liquor
store owner. This helps explain why he's now a former liquor store
owner who's made a remarkable career path change. Mitchell recently
sold his growing booze business to join the Overland Park Chamber
of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As the new retention and expansion manager for the chamber's
Economic Development Council, Mitchell becomes the liaison between
the business community, the chamber and City Hall. His job is to
keep the city's existing businesses happy while working to woo new
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing someone without eco-devo experience represents a
calculated gamble by Mary Birch, the chamber's president, but it
seems a good bet given Mitchell's background and track record.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, who grew up in Overland Park, took his undergraduate
degree in communications at Kansas State University in '91 and went
on to get a master's degree in administration from the University
of Missouri-Kansas City in 1994. His quest for a real-life business
challenge led him to the liquor store even though he had no
experience running a business or selling booze.
</P>
<P>
   The store, Mitchell recalled over lunch the other day, seemed an
underperformer and thus a good turnaround challenge. He had no
business background, though, which meant he had no banking
relationship. Some assistance from Mitchell's family helped
overcome the financing problem initially, but as his revitalization
efforts began to pay off, he eventually was able to find the
friendly banker he needed to help grow the business.
</P>
<P>
   The learning curve was steep, Mitchell said. While he's a
typical social drinker, his knowledge of wine and spirits was
minimal. Thus, the challenge was to learn how to run a business
while learning about his wares.
</P>
<P>
   Studying his myriad product mix, enhancing the personal and
business customer base, and putting in 60 to 80 hours a week
minding the store paid off. He took the store from an annual gross
of just under $300,000 in 1994 to some $800,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Birch said she had looked over a dozen or so candidates for the
job before Mitchell came to her attention. She characterizes the
retention and expansion manager's job as a ``chemistry-type
position,'' and she knew almost immediately that Mitchell had the
chemistry it takes to click with business community members.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Birch pointed out, he's a native Overland Parker, he's
been an achiever both professionally and academically, and his
experience gives him a special practical ability to relate to the
needs of small businesses. Birch also said Mitchell's role had a
special importance because the retention and expansion effort is
the fastest-growing part of Overland Park's economic development
effort.
</P>
<P>
   As for Mitchell, he expects to work as hard as he's ever worked
in his life, if not harder, but he still figures the hours can only
get better after those years of marathon days running his own
business.

DOLLAR FALLS AS U.S. AND JAPAN JOINTLY SUPPORT YEN
</HEADLINE>
   (See also JAPAN-ECON, DOLLAR-YEN) 
(ja) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Intervention by the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan
Wednesday on behalf of the yen sent the U.S. dollar plunging and
caused the second consecutive sharp selloff in the Treasury market.
The strong gains in many Asian stock markets also stemmed the
flight into Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   The coordinated intervention took the steam out of the dollar's
climb and made dollar-denominated investments like U.S. government
securities less attractive to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin confirmed that the Treasury and
Fed acted in concert with the Japanese central bank, and said the
two nations ``are prepared to continue to cooperate in the exchange
markets, as appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 9/32, to 105 17/32. The bond's
yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.73 percent,
from 5.65 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Porter, senior economist for Nesbitt Burns Securities,
said, ``On a near-term basis, the dollar could test its downside
technical support, leaving the bond market vulnerable to further
pressure. But if the past two episodes of intervention are any
indication, the dollar's long-term uptrend will re-emerge and we
will see bond yields begin dropping again. The long bond yield
could move back to 5.50 percent by the end of the year and to 5
percent by the end of 1999. That is, assuming the Asian economies
will not have rebounded by then.''
</P>
<P>
   But Porter thinks that it is likely we're only just now seeing
the first phase of an economic downturn in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. issued a record $3.45
billion junk bond offering through Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Securities. The eight part deal was the largest junk bond offering
in the last 10 years, second only to a $4 billion offering by RJR
Nabisco Holdings in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Yields and spreads over Treasury securities for the Niagara
Mohawk issue ranged from 6.50 percent, or 130 basis points over a
comparable maturity, to 8.539 percent, or 300 basis points higher.
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury plans next week to sell $23 billion of new two-year
and five-year notes. In when-issued trading the two-year note was
being offered at a price to yield 5.50 percent and the five-year
note 5.52 percent.

INTERIOR SECRETARY TO RENEGOTIATE ISSUE OF LEAD PROSPECTING IN MARK
TWAIN NATIONAL FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Allowing a lead-mining company to prospect on federal
land in the Missouri Ozarks may be tantamount to allowing the
company to mine, federal attorneys have concluded. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion has led to new negotiations between federal
officials and the company that are aimed at finally ending the
15-year struggle over whether lead prospecting should be occur in
the Ozarks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has decided to negotiate a new
agreement with Doe Run, the St. Louis company that has applied to
prospect within the Mark Twain National Forest, according to
federal documents released Tuesday by the Sierra Club. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement, the documents stated, should require Doe Run
to relinquish any future mining right that might be implied by its
prospecting permits in exchange for permission to prospect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The documents released Tuesday included an April 16 memorandum
from the Interior Department's solicitor, who has been reviewing
the secretary's legal options for months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Awarding the Doe Run Co. of St. Louis a prospecting permit
``could create an expectation, and perhaps a legal right, in the
permitee to develop minerals that might be found through
exploration,'' the solicitor's memo stated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's more, simply denying the prospecting permit might be a
risky legal move if Babbitt hasn't shown that he has at least
inquired about whether Doe Run would waive its future rights to
prospect, the memo said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Missouri environmental groups and Missouri Attorney
General Jay Nixon criticized Babbitt's decision Tuesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They said they'll settle for nothing less than Babbitt's denial
of any prospecting in the environmentally sensitive Ozarks, just a
few miles from federally protected Ozark streams. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These streams are the jewels of the Ozarks,'' Nixon said
Tuesday. ``We won't get a second chance if these places get
spoiled.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prospecting permits should not be issued until a full
environmental assessment is conducted, Nixon said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nixon promised he will explore in coming days what his office's
administration and legal options might be. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, meanwhile, called for a moratorium on new
mining in the sensitive Ozarks area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We will urge the secretary of the Interior and the secretary
of agriculture to formally withdraw this area from mining
activities,'' said Kathryn Hohmann, the Sierra Club's national
director of environmental quality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We will oppose any efforts to conduct any mining activities of
any type,'' Hohmann added. ``We are in this for the long haul.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hohmann and Ken Midkiff, lobbyist for the Sierra Club in

   The company has maintained that granting it permission to
prospect would not mean it would be guaranteed a right to mine in
the Ozarks. &QL;

<P>
   ``We have no entitlement to mine,'' Zelms said. ``We were quite
amazed that some have maintained that we do. We didn't believe we
had such rights.'' &QL;

   Interior officials in the solicitor's office could not be
reached for comment on Tuesday. &QL;

KANSAS MAN WINS THE HISTORY CHANNEL'S 4,400-MILE GREAT RACE

<P>
   STILWELL, Kan. _ Roaring out of the steep, wooded and curving
hills outside Boston on Saturday night, Rex Gardner of Stilwell
finally had a chance to shake a monkey off his back that had been
perched there for more than a decade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come in fifth and fourth and third and second, but never
first,'' said the 59-year-old marketing manager for CarQuest. ``But
let me tell you, it's much better to win.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Gardner and navigator Gary Kuck of Lincoln,
Neb., won the championship division of the History Channel's Great
Race from Tacoma, Wash., to Haverhill, Mass. The 14-day, 44-city,
4,400-mile endurance race tested vintage-car drivers' abilities to
follow directions and solve problems on the road. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Gardner, driving an open-cockpit 1917 Hudson Indy Speedster,
this was his 12th race and his best finish. The team posted a
28-second score, which means that after more than 58 checkpoints,
rain, sleet, snow, hail and a 34-degree day, they missed a perfect
score by that margin _ 28 seconds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The margin of victory was slim: two seconds better than the No.
2 finisher in the 20-team division. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Drivers are judged on how close they come to predetermined times
in stages. Checkpoints are set up along the route to keep track of
each racer, and penalty points are allotted for every second a car
is off the mark. As in golf, the lowest score wins. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come in second three times,'' Gardner said Tuesday after
driving home from Boston with the Hudson in tow. ``By the law of
averages it was bound to be my turn sooner or later.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With entry fee and other expenses, Gardner shelled out $15,000
to $16,000 to be in the race. And after all the prize money is
dished out, he'll come out with $38,000, all of which will go back
into the hobby. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is that not many people get to do anything like this
in their lifetime. It's the most intense kind of motor sport that
there is,'' he said. ``I've had a chance to prove myself as we
travel across the country.'' &QL;

KENNEDY, MCCARTHY INTRODUCE CHILDREN'S GUN VIOLENCE ACT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Reacting to a recent spate of school shootings, two
legislators who lost family members to gun violence introduced a
bill Wednesday to hold gun owners, dealers and manufacturers
criminally and civilly responsible for children who gain access to
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Children's Gun Violence Act would impose a prison
sentence of up to six months for the gun owner if a child gets a
loaded firearm and uses it in an act of violence. The owner could
be fined up to $10,000 if the child gains access to the loaded gun
and carries it in public.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bipartisan proposal, gun dealers would have their
licenses revoked automatically if they are found to have willfully
sold a gun to a juvenile. The measure would also increase the
criminal penalties for selling a gun to a minor. In addition,
prospective gun purchasers under age 24 would be required to
present two forms of identification to the dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Within 18 months of the measure's enactment, gun makers would be
required to place child safety locks on new firearms. The
legislation would also require firearm manufacturers to comply with
a trigger-resistance standard to make it more difficult for
children to fire the guns. In addition, the new guns would have to
pass a drop test to prevent accidental discharge if they are
mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who lost two brothers to
assassins' bullets in the 1960s, called the proposal ``the least we
can do to stop more schoolyard tragedies and deal more responsibly
with the festering crisis of gun violence involving children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband, Dennis, was killed
and her adult son Kevin seriously injured in a Long Island, N.Y.,
commuter-train shooting in 1993, added, ``It's time for us in
Congress to come together and protect our children.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association, however, assailed the proposal
as an infringement on the rights of gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gun-control measures such as one-size-fits-all government
storage mandates, prosecution of grieving parents and waiting
periods all fail to protect children or fight crime,'' said Tanya
Metaksa, NRA's chief Capitol Hill lobbyist. ``When fatal firearms
accidents are at an all-time low and violent crime is on the
decline, it is senseless to propose ineffective laws that will only
restrict the freedoms of law-abiding citizens and the fundamental
right of self defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure's introduction follows a rash of fatal school
shootings in the past few months. One incident involved the
sniper-style shooting of four junior high school students and a
teacher in Jonesboro, Ark. Arrested in the March 24 attack were
11-year-old Andrew Golden and Mitchell Johnson, 13, who allegedly
set off a fire alarm and started shooting when the teachers and
students evacuated the building.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and McCarthy announced the introduction of their
legislation on the grounds of the Capitol, where they were joined
by Suzann Wilson, whose daughter, Brittheny Varner, was killed in
Jonesboro. Wilson said the measure is not about taking rights away
from gun owners but ``giving rights back to our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocate Sarah Brady, whose family name adorns a
federal gun-control law, organized the Capitol Hill event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can no longer accept an epidemic of gun violence,'' said
Brady, whose husband, James, served as President Ronald Reagan's
press secretary and was seriously injured in the attempted
assassination of Reagan by John Hinckley Jr. in March 1981. ``There
are no good reasons for children to have access to guns.''

CONGRESSIONAL FINANCIAL OFFICE ISSUES REPORT ON SHORTCOMINGS OF B-2
STEALTH BOMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOB NOSTER, Mo. _ The B-2 stealth bomber fleet based in
Missouri can't yet fly as reliably or as secretly as promised,
according to a congressional report released this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a cost of $44.3 billion and counting, the 21 stealth bombers
still fall short of Air Force expectations in several ways,
Congress' General Accounting Office said Tuesday in its report. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The radar-defying skin of the aircraft _ a key to the plane's
stealth qualities and a problem in early models of the bomber _ is
delicate and regularly needs time-consuming taping, painting and
caulking. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Systems designed to let pilots know when enemy radar is about to
detect the bomber still do not work right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the report says that too much time _ days rather than hours
_ passes between B-2 missions because of trouble in planning its
precise flight patterns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Force operators at Whiteman Air Force Base told us,'' the
GAO investigators wrote, ``that the (trip-planning system) had so
many failures that they estimated it would take 60 hours to plan a
conventional mission and 192 hours to plan a nuclear mission.'' The
Air Force goal is eight hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Whiteman Air Force Base 60 miles southeast of Kansas City,
where the stealth planes are stationed, the people who keep the
bombers flying said the report merely notes the unfinished portions
of a work-in-progress. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give us a chance to mature,'' said Col. Bill
Percival, the commander of the 509th Operations Group. ``We're
going to be able to (fly) this jet as much as we need to, to strike
our targets.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the picture painted in the GAO report is of a bomber hobbled
by the same technology that makes it so revolutionary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fragile plane,'' said Owen R. Cote Jr., associate
director of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These things can only fly so often.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By military standards, the B-2 is slow and lumbering. By design,
it was never meant to outrun or out-maneuver the opposition. Once
spotted by an enemy, the B-2 is presumed dead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So the problems with its various shrouds could prove critical in
its ability to sneak past another country's air defenses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The layered materials in the plane's skin have proven a constant
headache. They ``frequently fail, requiring high amounts of
maintenance....This reduces the time aircraft are available.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a theme that runs through the report. Although pilots
praise the bomber as surprisingly nimble for something as wide as a
football field, the report said work needed to get the B-2 ready
for takeoff keeps it inside its hangar too much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hitting a large bird in flight can mean meticulous patching of
that surface. That, in turn, requires some climate control for the
paints and caulks used in the repairs. The GAO report states that
the Air Force may buy portable shelters for the B-2s when they are
stationed away from Whiteman. A series of movable hangars could
cost $15 million to $25 million. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charting the B-2's precise flight pattern toward a target _
important because the route plays a part in avoiding detection _ is
another trouble spot. What should take eight hours, the GAO report
said, took more than 20 times as long. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Percival said the time for planning conventional flights
already has been trimmed to 25 hours since the GAO investigation.
The Air Force said it expects to meet the eight-hour goal by late
1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the B-2 relies on on-board systems to warn its pilots
that they are wandering into enemy radar range. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force spent over $740 million to develop the defensive
system for the B-2A; however, test reports concluded that the
system is unsatisfactory,'' the report stated. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the Air Force has decided to cope with the system
and its limitations rather than look for more money and
perfection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It needed to provide total awareness of all electronics
surveillance everywhere,'' Percival said. ``I guess we shouldn't be
surprised if it's fallen a little short.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Col. Bill Hood, commander of the 309th Logistics Group, said a
training mission with two B-2s in Guam in March proved that the
bomber can fly reliably and often, even away from its
climate-controlled hangars in Missouri. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is I've got 10 jets here today, ready to go under
any conditions,'' Hood said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Still, the GAO report suggests the bomber once anticipated to be
built in greater numbers at a cost of $436 million a plane rather
$2.11 billion has significant limitations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The B-2 ended up being too expensive for us to buy in the
numbers you need for it to be effective,'' Cote said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Murphy, assistant director of National Security and
International Affairs Division of GAO, said expectations ``have
been lowered for the whole program... &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they are today is clearly not where they want to be in
terms of turning the plane around and getting more flights.'' &QL;

GENDER SOCIALIZATION INFLUENCES WORKPLACE SKILLS, RESEARCHER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Most everyone agrees that teamwork is an
essential workplace skill. But ask what being a ``good team
player'' means, and the answers vary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Men typically define a team player as someone who ``follows
orders'' or ``supports unquestionably.'' Women usually say a team
player ``shares information'' and ``collaborates.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pat Heim, who holds a doctorate in communication, finds those
differences when she researches gender differences in
organizations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What women see as `helpfulness' often is heard as criticism or
insubordination in the male culture,'' Heim said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heim's findings parallel those of Deborah Tannen, another
specialist in gender-related communication who, like Heim, has
written several books that detail why men and women sometimes
struggle to talk to and understand each other at work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heim has wrapped her research into a one-day seminar she calls
``He Said//She Said: Putting Gender Difference to Work,'' which she
presented recently to members of the Institute for Management
Studies in Kansas City. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said//she said differences are ingrained from birth, Heim
said. It's not just blue vs. pink blankets; it's the way babies are
spoken to and the way they're held. And, despite many gender-blind
efforts, socialization differences continue through childhood. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those childhood experiences _ particularly the way boys and
girls play _ left a mark on those who are now adults in the
workplace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys played team sports, war, cops and robbers, cowboys and
Indians. Girls played dolls and house,'' Heim said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys learned competition, conflict, devising strategies to
win, leadership, team play, hierarchies (do what the coach says).
Girls learned relationships, alliances, conflict avoidance,
negotiation and process.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heim said she was looking forward to studying women in their 20s
who are rising in the workplace ranks. They represent the first
crop of post-Title IX girls who, like boys, grew up playing team
sports after federal law required equivalent school athletic
opportunities for boys and girls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see if these young women have
brought the rules of team sports to the workplace, too,'' Heim
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she and other gender-difference researchers
find frequent misunderstanding among men and women. Basically, she
said, ``work is played by the rules of team sports,'' using
language that is second-nature to men but foreign to many women. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider Heim's examples: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the high school coach sends Mack onto the field with the
order to run 10 yards and cut right, Mack, who has been watching
the same play fail, doesn't say, ``I was thinking left would work
instead.'' Mack enters the game, runs 10 yards and cuts right. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Mary joins her girlfriends to play dolls, ``What do you
want to do?'' or ``Who do you want to be?'' are common questions.
Mary learns that if she consistently tries to boss others around
she's cut out of playgroups that thrive on consensus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward 20 years into the workplace and see the various
outcomes of those two different socializations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Mack's /{male/} boss says, ``I need the report by 3
o'clock.'' Mack knows he needs more time to do a good job, but he
does the best he can and puts the report on the boss's desk by 3
p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Mack's /{female/} boss says, ``If you can squeeze it in by 3
o'clock, it would be nice to have the report then.'' At 3 p.m.,
when she goes by Mack's desk for the report, Mack looks surprised,
``You said /{if/} I could squeeze it in...'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Mary's /{male/} boss says, ``I need the report by 3
o'clock.'' Mary knows she needs more time to do a good job, so she
starts to negotiate for more time. The boss is upset that she
questions his directive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   -- Mary's /{female/} boss says, ``If you can squeeze it in by 3
o'clock it would be nice to have the report then.'' Mary,
perceiving a collaboration, if not a level playing field, starts
discussing the pros and cons of getting it done by then. The boss
feels stressed when she devotes time to a conversation she didn't
want to have. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Heim warned, it is dangerous to generalize about an
entire sex. There are stereotype busters among both men and women.
But the way boys and girls played while growing up _ and perhaps
even genetic differences in the way male and female brains work _
create communication difficulties in the workplace, she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adult ``play'' continues to highlight the differences. Heim
suggested a comparison between shopping and hunting: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many women like to shop; they see shopping as an enjoyable
process. Many men like to hunt; they may enjoy the process, but are
more focused on reaching the end result _ the kill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The female focus on /{process/} vs. the male focus on /{goals/}
shows up often in the workplace. Women want to talk about a
problem; men just want to fix it and, if forced to talk about it,
want to cut straight to the end result, Heim said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crucial to the workplace success of both genders, she said, is
the ability to build relationships. Just like the definition of
teamwork, though, the definition of ``relationship'' varies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heim said men are more likely to offer friendliness, while women
are more apt to create friendships. There is a subtle difference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Friendliness comes and goes as needed to get something done.
Friendship is a relationship that overrides the project,'' she
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She attributes the difference, once again, to childhood
socializations. Men who are now in the workplace grew up playing on
teams with boys they didn't necessarily like. They learned to pull
together as a team anyway. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Women in the workplace today grew up with more control over who
their playmates were, Heim said. Liking someone was crucial to
building a relationship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Heim contended, a man on a workplace team is better able
to ignore ``the slimeball on the team'' and focus on the goal,
while the woman is more likely to be distressed by the slimeball's
presence on her team and fret that she can't establish the
relationship she would like to do the job well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Heim said, men are socialized to accept, if not
enjoy, conflict. They're more likely to shrug off a loss ``when the
game's over,'' while women will carry the loss with them, mourning
damaged interpersonal relationships and dwelling on what they did
wrong. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Curing the communication gap in the workplace requires
understanding how and why each gender talks the way it does, Heim
said. It also requires both genders to adapt a bit, both in how
they talk and in how they hear what the other says. &QL;

16-YEAR-OLD TAKES TIME OUT FROM HIS COMPUTER BUSINESS TO PROMOTE
MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ David Longnecker wasn't even born when a
younger Bill Gates was tapping out the first lines of code for what
later would become the Microsoft Windows operating system for
personal computers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not surprising that the now-goliath software
company run by Gates tagged the aggressive 16-year-old owner of a
Wichita computer company to hawk Microsoft's newest product,
Windows 98. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. will ship Windows 98, an update to the Windows
95 operating system, for sale June 25. Longnecker, who will be a
high school junior this year, is on a three-city publicity tour to
spread the word. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Longnecker was at a Microsoft seminar in May when he met one of
the company's senior systems engineers. He told her about Magic
Technologies, his 2-year-old computer company. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``She really thought what I was doing was neat,'' Longnecker
said. Then last week, ``she called up and asked, `Would you do this
little whirlwind tour? You have an hour to decide.' &UR; '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He took the job, but he won't be getting rich. It's an unpaid
gig. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets me out of the house, and it gets my name out there,''
Longnecker said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tour started in St. Louis on Monday, passed through Kansas
City on Tuesday and ended in Nashville, Tenn., on Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They left everything up to me,'' Longnecker said. ``I only
talked to a Microsoft representative once. When I got to St. Louis,
they handed me the (portable) computer and said, `Have fun.' &UR; '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, fun has meant getting up at 3 or 4 a.m. for early
television interviews followed by more media interviews throughout
the day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Longnecker has been testing early versions of the Microsoft
software for about two years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with it,'' he said. ``Everything I wanted changed
was changed.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the software has been criticized by some industry
analysts as containing relatively minor improvements over the
Windows 95 system, Longnecker said the software is worth the $89
Microsoft will charge for it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more changes than a lot of people can see,'' he
said. ``If I didn't already have it, I'd go out and get it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Computers seem to come naturally to Longnecker. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was big into Nintendo when I was a kid,'' he said. ``I got
my first computer when I was 12. It kind of grew from there.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long before natural curiosity took over. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got my computer, I took it apart,'' Longnecker
said. ``What upset my parents was when I took apart the TV.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He managed to rebuild both the computer and television. In 1996,
at age 14, an employee in the Wichita company where his uncle
worked offered to pay Longnecker to build a computer for his
family. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Magic Technologies officially was born in June 1996. Longnecker
is still the company's only employee but has 60 customers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Day-to-day operations are like any small business, Longnecker
said. He handles sales, manufacturing and bookkeeping, all based on
tips he got from employees at his uncle's business. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Longnecker said his company netted between $4,000 and $5,000
last year. ``I make more than the average 16-year-old does at
McDonald's,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In his other life as high school student, Longnecker said he has
maintained an A average. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His goals? A computer information systems degree from Friends
University in Wichita and a job with Microsoft. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later, they have to hire me,'' Longnecker said.
``I'm doing all this stuff for them.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: GIULIANI'S RISING GRANDIOSITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mayor will probably go one for two. A new stadium
for the Yankees on the West Side of Manhattan will never happen.
But Rudolph Giuliani will probably get his skybox bunker, the
overpriced emergency command center on the 23rd floor of a World
Trade Center building.
</P>
<P>
   A bulletproof bunker in the clouds over Manhattan perfectly
suits the remote, authoritarian, condescending and defensive
personality of Giuliani. Isolated and protected behind a
shatterproof shield, he'll be able to look down at the magnificent
city that he may or may not love, but clearly loves to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mayor's denials, the plans for the bunker were
carried out in secret. New Yorkers found out about it through The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   So, without benefit of an honest discussion of its merits, the
city is about to make a huge, long-term investment in a high-tech
facility that's in a building it doesn't even control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I question why we would want to make such tremendous
improvements on somebody else's property,'' said Councilwoman
Kathryn Freed, in whose district the command center will be
located. ``The annual rental is a million-four, which impresses me
as being huge. But it's only a 20-year lease. What if they don't
renew the lease?''
</P>
<P>
   A similar command center in Los Angeles is in a sub-basement of
City Hall, four floors below ground level. That type of facility is
far more secure than the 23rd floor of a high-rise, and there is no
landlord to contend with. The annual expenses in Los Angeles are
about $1 million to $1.5 million for maintenance, software
upgrades, equipment improvements and the like. In New York those
kinds of expenses would be in addition to the annual rent of $1.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   The real price of the bunker is not $15 million, as the budget
line would suggest, but more like $70 million over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many self-aggrandizing features of the bunker is a
teleconferencing system that would allow the mayor to communicate
face-to-face with the president of the United States. Don't count
on that happening. You don't just ring up the president, even in an
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Cutler, the deputy assistant to the president for
intergovernmental affairs, said: ``Any mayor in America can find
any of us through the White House switchboard if anything happens.
There's immediate access.'' But she added: ``It would be hard for
me to make the case for face-to-face communication being necessary.
We have a million issues that happen in communities all over the
country every day.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many potential problems with Giuliani's command
center. When a property is city-owned, the mayor and other
officials can easily control access in emergencies, sharply
limiting those who are authorized to go in and out. That is not the
case in an office building filled with other paying tenants.
</P>
<P>
   And elevators in a high-rise are always a potential problem in
an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Because the bunker was cleverly and successfully concealed as it
made its way through the budget process, the potential problems,
large and small, were not adequately examined. The full range of
possible alternatives was never explored.
</P>
<P>
   That is the way of this mayor. He does not believe in running a
free and open government. He believes he is the government,
answerable to no one. Questions are out of the question. Ask this
mayor what time it is, and he'll tell you to file a freedom of
information request. If a judge grants the request, Giuliani will
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But he cannot silence all of the voices that are being raised in
opposition. Kathryn Freed will continue to point out that while he
is building his bunker and fighting for a West Side stadium, ``The
mayor cut libraries, he cut senior citizens' programs, he cut
after-school programs, he cut parks.''
</P>
<P>
   And Peter Vallone, the mild-mannered speaker of the Council who
has become the target of ferocious attacks by the mayor, will
continue to assert: ``This mayor not only uses his bully pulpit, he
uses his power to bully people. You can only push people around so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic government is a collaborative effort, and while it
may not work efficiently it generally works well. The mayor hopes
to be president someday, but that's unlikely. His instincts are
working against him.
</P>

COMMENTARY: THE KOSOVO DILEMMA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Russia's new national security adviser, the
thoughtful academician Andrei Kokoshin, is in town to reassure the
Clinton administration it should not worry about Moscow's
technology exports to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast with reporters, Boris Yeltsin's man was asked if
Russia would stand with NATO in responding militarily to Slobodan
Milosevic's bloody crackdown in Serbia's mainly Albanian province
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``No need to use force,'' he replied. But, I pressed, wasn't the
credible threat of force necessary in diplomacy? Kokoshin replied
in an accented English and mock-serious tone reminiscent of Henry
Kissinger world-wearily explaining geostrategy to nonprofessionals:
``That is not a universal truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is surely a regional truth. In the cauldron of ethnic and
religious hatred known as the Balkans, the philosophy attributed to
the gangster Al Capone applies: ``You get more with a kind word and
a gun than with a kind word alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain and France, followed by the U.S., have finally seemed to
grasp that regional truth. As usual, however, Kokoshin's
compatriot, the spymaster-diplomat Yevgeny Primakov, has inserted
himself between the interests of human beings and the interests of
a tinpot tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   When the West finally realized it had to use bombs to stop
Serbia's rape of Bosnia, it was despite Primakov's foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
   But Bosnia was independent; Kosovo is part of Serbia. The
Russians have an interest in seeing to it that Serbia maintains
sovereignty in Kosovo: If Albanian separatists succeed in breaking
free, then Chechen separatists would establish the precedent for
their secession from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Already Chechen fighters are infiltrating into Kosovo to help
ethnic Albanians establish the principle that old borders are not
sacrosanct and that ethnicity should determine nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Our natural impulse is to side with the oppressed Kosovars.
Milosevic manipulated Serbian war criminals in Bosnia. His arrogant
abrogation of the Kosovars' autonomy a decade ago invited today's
trouble. By driving tens of thousands from their homes, he has
radicalized the local population behind the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But are we prepared to use our military might to support local
uprisings around the world? Who's a patriot to be protected and
who's a terrorist to be condemned?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. cannot encourage revolt within countries, but neither
can it ignore blatant violations of human rights or ethnic
cleansing. That means we cannot adopt a hard-and-fast policy of
either cool isolation or righteous intervention.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Iraq, for example, our no-fly zone enforces autonomy
for the Kurds, but we do not threaten Turkey with an independent
Kurdistan. In Indonesia, we should be urging Jakarta's new regime
to negotiate the return of East Timor to independence. In Tibet, we
should lean hard on China to stop its repression. But in Africa,
where Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia, the separated peoples are now
warring; even breaking up is hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave us with Kosovo? Inaction creates a vacuum
sucking in Greeks, Turks and Persians.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's contact group should ignore Primakov's smokescreen and
tell the duplicitous Milosevic: Pull your brutal troops out now and
let refugees return, or else. Expect no more flyovers, pinpricks or
off-again-on-again sanctions. If NATO is forced to hit, 60 Serbian
SAM sites would be the first targets, and then out go the lights in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, we should warn Albanian ``liberators'': We're
not providing air cover for secession. Support your moderates'
negotiations. Unless Milosevic chooses war, make your goal the
return of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   If such a deal calls for a European border patrol to reassure
the Serbs about infiltration, let Europeans man it, supervising
joint Serbian and Albanian teams. America should help with
satellite surveillance and economic aid but not make another
open-ended commitment to be the cop on Europe's beat.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this satisfies neither Serbian sovereign rights nor
Albanian ethnic yearnings. But no nation has a right to wipe out or
drive out inhabitants not in rebellion. That's a universal truth.

<P>
   Japan's economic performance in the 1990s continues to be
disappointing, frustrating and worrisome. Tokyo's economic
sluggishness is souring life at home and setting off international
reverberations.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Japan's financial weakness is mirrored in other Asian
countries. More important, Japan's failure to deal with its
economic woes provides a hint of the resistance to reform that may
be expected elsewhere in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, among bureaucrats and politicians there remains a strong
faith in the Japanese style of capitalism and a resistance to truly
liberating financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the Japanese public clamoring for deregulation. It
associates such reform with unemployment and instability in
personal lives _ but the Japanese have spent the past half-century
trying to reduce such uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the 1990s were started by the bursting of the
real-estate and stock-market bubbles of the 1980s. The government
deserves much of the blame for the financial excesses and the
stagnation that has followed, but its dogmatically conservative
attitudes are delaying recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The financial sector is swamped by a mind-boggling array of bad
debts and underfunded pension liabilities, amounting to as much as
$1.5 trillion. Scandal after scandal exposes unethical or illegal
behavior. And many of the policies being adopted to clean up this
mess will delay resolution of the bad debts and counterproductively
increase government control.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the torrent of pronouncements from Tokyo about economic
stimulus and deregulation, the world will be disappointed with the
results. While some financial deregulation will occur, those who
believe that Japan will adopt an American economic model are
mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese bureaucrats and politicians, including the elite at the
Ministry of Finance, continue to be in deep denial. They do not
comprehend the extent of reforms necessary to restore the nation to
economic health. Instead they regard their current problems as a
passing incident with no fundamental implications for the ongoing
overall system.
</P>
<P>
   These problems harbor a variety of international ramifications.
The International Monetary Fund's bailout for Indonesia, Thailand
and South Korea includes substantial reform of their financial
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Japan will not be a firm supporter of this
initiative. Nor will Japan import many more goods and services as
Southeast Asia attempts to export its way out of trouble. Japan has
damaged its self-assumed role as a leader of Asia and will prove a
weak international partner for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's present economic problems and reluctance to reform
follow an era of roughly 10 percent annual growth, which ended in
1973. After that, the economy grew at a more modest 4 percent until
the early 1990s. The Japanese slowdown has brought a gradual,
piecemeal unraveling of the postwar financial boom.
</P>
<P>
   Eager for new business, large commercial banks moved into real
estate lending in the 1980s with the Ministry of Finance's explicit
support and guidance. Along with insurance companies and securities
firms, they invested aggressively overseas as regulatory
restrictions fell.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in decades, the banks were faced with
unfamiliar loan clients, but they continued to assume that the
Ministry of Finance would guarantee their viability. Their
recklessness fed the real-estate and stock-market speculation of
the late 1980s, which caused both urban real-estate and stock
prices nearly to triple in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japanese financial institutions' penchant for
making investments based on long-term personal or corporate
relationships had serious repercussions, especially when banks
sought new clients. Banks began financing new borrowers with the
same assumption _ that personal relationships would suffice as a
screening mechanism. The herd instincts of Japanese banks took the
place of hard-nosed financial analysis.
</P>
<P>
   This explanation, however, puts the most charitable face on what
was happening behind the scenes in Japan in the 1980s. The scandals
that have emerged in the 1990s have revealed shocking examples of
indiscretion and malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   Favored investors at securities firms were given guaranteed
returns on their equity portfolios. Huge loans went to small
businesses for speculation in the stock market and real estate.
Large banks eagerly introduced crooked clients to subsidiary banks
or credit co-ops in order to keep questionable loans off their own
books while hoping to benefit from the business.
</P>
<P>
   Financial institutions continued to pay off racketeers who
threatened to reveal negative information at annual shareholder
meetings. Ministry of Finance officials told banks when to expect
inspections, in exchange for lavish entertainment and other favors.
And there have been allegations that the Ministry of Finance
approved and recommended illegal schemes to hide financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   These scandals go far beyond isolated incidents. They suggest a
debilitating fear of disclosing bad news, illegal dealings between
financial institutions, politicians and bureaucrats, and the
involvement of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably much of this behavior took place earlier, but both
the need for new outlets for lending and the euphoria created by
the stock and real-estate bubbles drastically increased its
prevalence.
</P>
<P>
   When the bubbles burst, the fallout included enormous bad debts,
the magnitude of which is still not known, mainly because of
Japan's loose requirements on reporting bad, or nonperforming,
loans. In late 1997, the Ministry of Finance admitted that problem
loans totaled some 79 trillion yen ($630 billion), about 15 percent
of all Japanese bank lending and an enormous 16 percent of the
gross domestic product. These levels of bad debt resemble those in
Indonesia or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   More bad news may be coming since Japanese banks hold roughly
one-third of international loans to South Korea, Thailand and
Indonesia. Officially, Japanese lending to Asian countries totals
some $125 billion, but it may be larger. An unknown portion of
these loans are bad, but if Japanese banks behaved with the same
imprudence as elsewhere, the prognosis is not good.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Japan's situation is not encouraging. An outright
financial collapse with many banks going belly-up is unlikely, if
only because of the lengths to which the government will go to
prevent it. But the more likely scenario _ Japan muddling along
with substandard growth and an unstable financial sector _ is
hardly more encouraging. Neither scenario is good for Japan, Asia
or the world.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the seriousness of Japan's financial troubles, neither
Tokyo nor the public believes in the American economic model. And
Japan's reluctance to undertake reform may send conflicting signals
to other Asian nations as the crisis moves into its next stage.
This is all the more unfortunate since Japan is a leading member of
the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Japan's economic stagnation suggests that it will
do little to revive Asia's health. Asia's struggling economies will
try to recover by increasing their exports. As the world's
second-largest economy, Japan could play a helpful role by
absorbing a portion of those exports.
</P>
<P>
   But here is the rub: Japan is following the same strategy as its
poorer Southeast Asian neighbors. Rather than absorbing more
imports, Japan will shift its burden through more exports to the
United States. Despite any rhetoric about a global partnership,
Tokyo is quite willing to let the United States underwrite the
Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The international ramifications of Japan's financial weakness
extend beyond economics. The Japanese are now absorbed by domestic
problems; they have little interest in the problems of the rest of
Asia. Japan was noticeably silent during the recent crisis over
Iraq, articulating only the request that any military action be
postponed until after the Nagano Winter Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of South Korea's economic crisis, Japan chose to
press a petty dispute over fishing rights. Just a few years ago,
Japan was awash in talk of playing a larger role in the world, and
the government mounted a modest campaign to become a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council. Today there is little interest
expressed in international diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has found it difficult to exert pressure on Tokyo.
But it is time for the United States to send less-than-subtle
signals to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship includes broad consulting arrangements, within
which American officials could simply stop providing advice.
Through canceled meetings, unreturned telephone calls and a lack of
advance notice of American policy moves, the United States can send
the message that it no longer regards Japan as a global partner.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem like a heavy-handed way to treat the world's
second-largest economy, but under present circumstances it may be
the only way to move Japan off a path that is destructive for us
all.

ELTON PLANS LOW-KEY WELCOME FOR WOODWARD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ELTON, England _ This village promises a low-key homecoming for
native daughter Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Elton say they are embarrassed at the celebratory
image they gave the world months ago when Woodward's conviction was
reduced to manslaughter. Photographs then showed supporters pouring
champagne and singing soccer victory songs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Brendan Durkan, an Elton elected official and 25-year
resident, said, ``It'll be a homecoming. It won't be a celebration.
A baby is dead. A young girl has been convicted of his
manslaughter, and has to live with that for the rest of her life. I
feel sad for all those involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Elton residents said they have become disillusioned with
Woodward in the wake of developments in the case in the past month,
including accusations that the Woodwards misused money in their
defense fund, and the firing of one Woodward's lawayers, who
allegedly told a Massachusetts state trooper when she was arrested
for drunken driving that she had come to believe Woodward is
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at first a lot of people were behind her because she
is from England, and there was a strong England vs. America
sentiment with this story,'' said Sheena Dunne, 36, a legal
secretary from Cheshire, as she left work Wednesday in downtown
Manchester. ``But after some of these other issues came to light,
it was hard to know what to believe. I don't think she meant to
kill the baby, but she is still guilty, and it has all been rather
bizarre lately.''
</P>
<P>
   This week for the first time, habitually pro-Woodward newspapers
became uncharacteristically restrained, cautioning against making
Woodward a heroine. Wednesday``The death of a child is immensely
sad, and not a matter of popping champagne corks,'' The Daily
Telegraph wrote Wednesday. Several news organizations urged her not
to try to sell her story.
</P>
<P>
   Still, The Rigger Pub promises to be crowded with residents and
reporters. Yellow ribbon is tied to every available post and tree;
police have blocked off the street leading to the Woodwards' home;
and the display window of the local bakery features cream-filled
sponge cakes topped with photos of Woodward and the words,
``Welcome Home, Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and her father, Gary, are scheduled to arrive in London
early this morning. They will then fly to Manchester Airport, where
the Woodward family will meet with the media at approximately 8
a.m. local time. The family is then expected to travel about 40
miles west to Elton, arriving at about 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward has not been home since the saga began in the first
week of February 1997, when 8-month-old Matthew Eappen lapsed into
a coma and later died.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Woodward's mother, Susan, remained secluded in the
family home, while a lawyer released a statement to quash rumors
that the former au pair had sold her story to a British tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to speculation, (Woodward) will not be going into
hiding at the behest of any national newspaper or media
organization,'' said Paul Barrow, the legal adviser to the Louise
Woodward and Family Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The trust, used to pay Woodward's legal expenses, continues to
receive donations. Wednesday, during a regular meeting of Woodward
supporters at the Elton Community Center, volunteers opened several
handfuls of mail, yielding about $1,600 in checks. Woodward friends
said the trust fund _ which once totalled $450,000 _ is now down to
about $50,000 and will be used to pay for the legal battles to
appeal Woodward's conviction or fight the civil suit filed by the
Eappen family.
</P>
<P>
   It was from this trust that Sue Woodward allegedly skimmed
$15,400 using a forged invoice.
</P>
<P>
   Many here say Woodward, who has said that she wants to go to
college, may have a hard time finding work. They argue that selling
her story may be the only way she can make a living. Others say it
would seriously damage her credibility, even among her supporters
here, to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even some close family friends were less than
jubilant as they awaited her homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved Louise is coming home, but this is no place for
rejoicing,'' said Steve Collins, who took in Woodward's sister,
Vickie, 19, when her parents were in the United States for the
trial. ``Louise could have come home from America the same way she
went over: free. That hasn't happened.''

HOUSE VOTES TO DROP FEDERAL TAX CODE 
</HEADLINE>
 CODE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House voted Wednesday to eliminate the entire
tax code by the end of 2002, in an election-year gesture meant to
appeal to conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved by a vote of 219-209, would wipe out the
existing tax code, except Social Security payroll taxes, by Dec.
31, 2002 _ as long as Congress enacts a replacement system by July
4, 2002. The measure provides no alternative tax system, and the
Republican majority is sharply divided between a flat tax and
national sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty Republicans voted against the bill, including the two
from Connecticut, Representatives Christopher Shays and Nancy
Johnson, while 15 Democrats supported the measure. All 10
Massachusetts Democrats opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an amateurs' bill,'' said Representative Fortney
``Pete'' Stark, a California Democrat. He called the bill
``foolishness,'' and said the GOP leaders were being ``led around
by the nose.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure caused an unusual split among the GOP's business
constituency. The National Federation of Independent Business
favors repealing the IRS code, but the Chamber of Commerce remained
neutral and business leaders have said the uncertainty created by
eliminating the tax code could wreak havoc with financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, speaking to reporters, strongly opposed the
measure. ``If you voted to get rid of it without saying what the
replacement was, you would put individual Americans and families in
an uncertain position about their investments and health
insurance,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He also referred to the current economic crisis in Asia and
said, ``The last thing in the world we need to do right now is to
send some signal of instability, that we decided to get rid of our
whole tax code without knowing what the replacement would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Steve Largent, an Oklahoma Republican and chief
sponsor of the bill, conceded that the measure probably would not
pass in the Senate. But he said the vote would begin a national
debate on the issue that would be resolved by the 2000 presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take more than a majority'' of Congress ``to pass
this,'' said Largent. ``This is lighting a fire under everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The closeness of the vote, however, surprised House leaders who
had made the bill a high priority. After the roll call and an
unscheduled recess, House leaders announced they had dropped a
previously scheduled vote on a new rule for debating the campaign
finance bill. The new rule would have allowed nearly 300 unrelated
amendments to be added to the campaign bill, a strategy Democrats
called ``death by amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   During debate on the tax bill, supporters argued that Congress
needed to change a system that has become complicated and
burdensome to average taxpayers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said abolishing the existing code with nothing in
its place threatened the stability of the government and the real
estate and construction industries. The existing code provides for
collecting money that funds all government functions, plus it
allows homeowners a mortgage deduction and allows municipalities
and states to float bonds for construction projects.

POP STARS INCREASINGLY EARN MONEY FOR NOTHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't listen to Mariah Carey's music that much, don't think
about her a whole lot, don't much care which ballplayer she's
dating.
</P>
<P>
   But when she gave only two days' notice that she would NOT sing
at the recent KISS Party '98 at Starplex, well, that bothered me.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that I had a ticket and had been waiting with bated
breath for la Carey's ``first appearance ever in Texas'' (as we
were repeatedly told.) It wasn't that I didn't understand that this
was a free show and that, now as always, you get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Nope, Carey's inability to do at least a short set got my goat
because it was the final proof I needed that pop stars aren't very
good at being pop stars anymore.
</P>
<P>
   There used to be certain basic rules about performing in front
of people. One was that if you say you're going to appear at a
concert, hey, you actually sing something; and no, Mariah, a brief
a cappella version of ``My All'' doesn't count.
</P>
<P>
   Carey's glaring lack of class and common sense, however, is just
the latest in a long series of examples of the larger problem.
</P>
<P>
   A generalization? Yes. But the evidence is pretty irrefutable.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Carey do only one song at the KISS show, but so did
Olivia Newton-John, who has a new CD out and is once again trying
to sell herself as a country singer. You'd think she'd at least
have favored the crowd with one tune from the new CD. But, no.
Guess it's just not important enough to her.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the whole Ginger Spice debacle. Here she is, an
extremely wealthy woman who made her fortune as part of a group
that sold itself as an all-for-one-and-one-for-all unit. And she
backs out of a major U.S. tour (and leaves the group altogether)
just days before the first U.S. show _ and after tickets had been
sold in just about every market.
</P>
<P>
   So much, I guess, for the maxim ``the show must go on'' and
honoring one's commitments, pleasant or not. So much, too, for
really caring about all those little girls supposedly being taught
the value of ``girl power.''
</P>
<P>
   In times gone by, Ginger would have toughed it out until the
tour was over. I think the Spice Girls should go ahead with the
tour and give everyone who shows up a rebate good for one-fifth the
face value of the ticket; seems only fair.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the inability of some musicians to say anything
while onstage. Plenty still do, but a distressing number of
performers don't feel they even owe the fans a ``good evening'' or
a ``hello,'' much less something as simple as introducing the next
song.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't think this is so hard, but it was for Cornershop's
Tjinder Singh, Spiritualized's Jason Pierce and ALL the members of
Dead Can Dance, all of whom said virtually nothing in between songs
at recent shows. Come on, people. You've traveled all the way from
Europe, you're playing before thousands of adoring fans, and you
can't say, ``Thank you''?
</P>
<P>
   But at least those bands tour. So many don't, forgetting that
even in the age of video, the road still breaks bands and
solidifies fan bases. It broke Oasis, it broke Everclear, it broke
Metallica and Dave Matthews and Phish and Sheryl Crow and Jewel and
Paula Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Pulp and Primal Scream, just to name two, have made
good-to-great CDs in the past eight months, and neither has sold
worth a darn, in large part because they either did brief U.S.
tours, or none at all. If you want to stay home and watch soccer
and take it easy, fine; just don't expect to sell in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   If Eric Clapton or bands such as Aerosmith, Metallica and U2 can
still, even with all their wealth, support a CD with several months
of roadwork, so can everyone else. To say nothing of the punishing
schedules still maintained by guys such as B.B. King.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as recently as 15 years ago this sort of stuff was
just common sense. If you really wanted to be a successful
musician, you climbed in a van or a bus and paid your dues. And you
acted happy to be there, because you were one of the fortunate few,
the 1 percent or so of all musicians to make it out of the local
bar-band grind.
</P>
<P>
   For some time now, all that's been reversed; we're supposed to
act as though any appearance by any pop musician is as good as a
vision of the Virgin Mary. It's not; it's just people with some
level of talent playing music. And often, at the level of a Carey
or a Spice Girl, being more than amply rewarded for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   They're the lucky ones. Not us.

<P>
   &UR; FEATURE STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CANBY-THEATER (New York) _ The Drama Dept.'s quite enchanting
resurrection of ``As Thousands Cheer,'' the 1933 Irving Berlin-Moss
Hart topical revue, which is at the Greenwich House Theater. A
topical revue that is still funny. By Vincent Canby. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SACRED-MUSIC (Fez Morocco) _ The fourth Fez Festival of World
Sacred Music, for all its variety, was limited to music by
monotheism: Christianity, Judaism and Islam. It could have covered
an even broader terrain, from the stasis and clangor of Tibetan
Buddhist chanting to the drumming and dancing of West African
Yoruba ceremonies, and Fez festivals in coming years may do just
that. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SIDE-MAN-THEATER (Undated) _ After toiling for 20 years not
exactly anonymously but far from the bright lights of fame as a
freelance journalist, stand-up comic, playwright, screenwriter and
movie director, nobody is more surprised to see ``Side Man,'' a
memory play about jazz performers, land on Broadway than its
author, Warren Leight, 41. In jazz parlance, sideman refers to a
musician who works for hire on band jobs, who knows the standards
by heart and who can solo dazzlingly but also blend in with an
orchestra's sound. By Steven Drukman. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILMS4KIDS (Undated) _ Brief reviews of some films and their
suitability for children. This week: ``The X-Files''; ``Mulan'';
``Six Days, Seven Nights''; ``Can't Hardly Wait'' and ``Dirty
Work.'' (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SODERBERGH-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ When Lady Luck smiles on a
26-year-old first-time director, she doesn't take it kindly that he
ignores her and heads out on his own path. But now, at 35, after
five well-crafted bleak flops, Steven Soderbergh has returned to
knock on her door with ``Out of Sight,'' an upbeat romantic film
starring George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. By Jamie Diamond.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   SMOKE-SIGNALS-FILM (Sliammon Indian Reserve, British Columbia) _
The new movie in which Evan Adams, 31, an American Indian actor is
a co-star, ``Smoke Signals,'' opens Friday. It is funny and
complex, as well as poignant, casting a new light on the Indian
sensibility. By James Sterngold. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   FILMS-STEREOTYPES (Undated) _ We live in a time when bullies are
in fashion and creative work that addresses social injustice or the
validity of someone else's suffering is likely to meet with braying
accusations of ``victim art'' and ``political correctness.'' Some
filmmakers accommodate themselves to such a climate by deploying,
with a wink and a naughty grin, the sort of stereotypes that began
to disappear from movies 30 years ago and that to some of us at
least, can't be redeemed by any amount of post-modernist irony or
neo-noir chic. By Karen Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MARK-MORRIS-DANCE (Undated) _ The Mark Morris Dance Group was
just eight years old and performing for the first time at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Opera House when the company's general
manager, Barry Alterman, spoke about his vision for Morris in New
York: ``I want each of Mark's appearances in town to be an event.''
Now comes a Morris double bill at the opera house, Wednesday
through Saturday, with all the makings of still another ``event.''
The run includes Morris's final appearances, sometimes known as
``farewell performances,'' in his danced version of ``Dido and
Aeneas,'' Purcell's 1689. By Robert Greskovic.
</P>
<P>
   UKRAINIAN-DANCE (New York) _ The last time the Virsky Ukranian
National Dance Company visited New York, in 1988, Ukraine was part
of the Soviet Union and the troupe was beholden to its Moscow
sponsors. That is, it was strongly encouraged to perform Russian
dances along with Ukranian ones. This week Virsky, one of the
world's premiere professional folk troupes, returns to New York for
three performances at City Center, on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday
as part of a 38-city North American tour. And this time all the
dances are Ukranian. By Terry Trucco. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL &LR;
</P>
<P>
   GENEVA-OPERA-HOUSE (Geneva, Switzerland) _ While other cities
have lost their beloved 19th-century opera houses in the wave of
overgrown performing-arts centers, the board of the opera company
here bucked the tide. At the same time that it took necessary steps
to preserve the Grand Theatre, Geneva's elegant opera house from
1882, it developed a second house in many ways as good as the old
one. By Paula Deitz. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   GABRIEL-FAURE-MUSIC (New York) _ Music tells no stories, but it
is a sign of human behavior. John Philip Sousa tells the world that
Americans want to make friends. The music of Gabriel Faure tells us
that the French are private, lonely, tender, furtive, wistful. Five
concerts of Faure's music at the Kaye Playhouse recently were
generously American, just as the music remained elusively French.
By Bernard Holland. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   PROKOFIEV-MUSIC (Undated) _ Today, as composers are being told
to be more popular, Sergei Prokofiev may re-emerge as a role model
for the young and ambitious. The composer of the ``Classical''
Symphony, ``Peter and the Wolf,''``Lieutenant Kije'' and ``Romeo
and Juliet'' knew a thing or two about popularity. By David Schiff.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RINGO-STARR-MUSIC (Undated) _ For a musician who was once part
of the most influential band in pop, spending more than a decade
rekindling a career must be an intensely frustrating business. But
listening to ``Vertical Man,'' Ringo Starr's 12th post-Beatles
studio album, one has to admire the cheerful industriousness with
which he has tried to recapture the success of his early hits,
``Ringo'' (1973) and ``Goodnight Vienna'' (1974). By Allan Kozinn.
(Moved).
</P>
<P>
   BRIAN-WILSON-MUSIC (St. Charles, Ill.) _ Brian Wilson is back.
That is, he's back gain. Brian Wilson has been back a lot over the
last two decades, and every time, it is hailed as a return to form
after years of mental instability. There is a myth engulfing
Wilson, and it is something he will have to deal with in marketing
campaigns for the rest of his life. By Neil Strauss. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DAGUERREOTYPE (Undated) _ The daguerreotype is perhaps the most
rapidly accepted and disseminated invention in history. In 1839,
shortly after his process was announced to the world, Louis J.M.
Daguerre wrote an instruction manual. Within three months, 29
editions were published in six languages. Now, through July 12, the
J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, which owns one of the most
important daguerreotype collections in the world, has more than 125
examples from its holdings on view, as well as a display of studio
and darkroom equipment from the collection of Matthew Isenburg. By
Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   IRVINE-MUSEUM-ART (Undated) _ Nearly lost in the sprawling
suburbs and high-tech industrial parks of Orange County, Calif., is
the unassuming Irvine Museum. It provides an unlikely setting for
the world's largest collection of California Impressionist
paintings. Now, some of the finest works of this underappreciated
genre have reached New York, bringing their airy palettes and play
of California light to the National Academy Museum in a show titled
``All Things Bright and Beautiful: California Impressionist
Paintings From the Irvine Museum.'' By David Kirby.
</P>
<P>
   ARCHITECTURE-VINOLY (Undated) _ Even though Rafael Vinoly is the
most elegant architect now practicing in the United States, he
probably doesn't want to hear about it. The elegance of his work is
ascetic as well as esthetic. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MUSEUM-PYTHON (Undated) _ The bicoastal Museum of Television
and Radio honors the sterling memory of ``Monty Python's Flying
Circus'' beginning Friday, with a three-day marathon presentation
of all 45 episodes from the show's four seasons on the BBC. Then,
commencing June 30 and running seriatim through late September in
two-week cycles, the museum will present a dozen composite packages
of pre-, post- and pluperfect-Python material. By Jeff MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   TV-BOB-AND-MARGARET (Undated) _ Monday night at 10:30, ``Bob and
Margaret,'' an animated series about a British couple, created by a
Canadian husband and a British wife, will have its premiere on
Comedy Central. And although producers urged the creators to have
Bob and Margaret move to the United States or at least take up with
some American friends, the couple, their social circle and the show
remain firmly rooted in London. By Anita Gates. (Moved).
</P>

   &UR; TRAVEL (`t' category) &LR;

   TRAVEL-SUNVALLEY (Undated) _ A summer of double axels. By Linda

ELTON PLANS LOW-KEY WELCOME FOR WOODWARD

<P>
   ELTON, England _ This village promises a low-key homecoming for
native daughter Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Elton say they are embarrassed at the celebratory
image they gave the world months ago when Woodward's conviction was
reduced to manslaughter. Photographs then showed supporters pouring
champagne and singing soccer victory songs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Brendan Durkan, an Elton elected official and 25-year
resident, said, ``It'll be a homecoming. It won't be a celebration.
A baby is dead. A young girl has been convicted of his
manslaughter, and has to live with that for the rest of her life. I
feel sad for all those involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Elton residents said they have become disillusioned with
Woodward in the wake of developments in the case in the past month,
including accusations that the Woodwards misused money in their
defense fund, and the firing of one Woodward's lawayers, who
allegedly told a Massachusetts state trooper when she was arrested
for drunken driving that she had come to believe Woodward is
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at first a lot of people were behind her because she
is from England, and there was a strong England vs. America
sentiment with this story,'' said Sheena Dunne, 36, a legal
secretary from Cheshire, as she left work Wednesday in downtown
Manchester. ``But after some of these other issues came to light,
it was hard to know what to believe. I don't think she meant to
kill the baby, but she is still guilty, and it has all been rather
bizarre lately.''
</P>
<P>
   This week for the first time, habitually pro-Woodward newspapers
became uncharacteristically restrained, cautioning against making
Woodward a heroine. Wednesday``The death of a child is immensely
sad, and not a matter of popping champagne corks,'' The Daily
Telegraph wrote Wednesday. Several news organizations urged her not
to try to sell her story.
</P>
<P>
   Still, The Rigger Pub promises to be crowded with residents and
reporters. Yellow ribbon is tied to every available post and tree;
police have blocked off the street leading to the Woodwards' home;
and the display window of the local bakery features cream-filled
sponge cakes topped with photos of Woodward and the words,
``Welcome Home, Louise.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward and her father, Gary, are scheduled to arrive in London
early this morning. They will then fly to Manchester Airport, where
the Woodward family will meet with the media at approximately 8
a.m. local time. The family is then expected to travel about 40
miles west to Elton, arriving at about 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward has not been home since the saga began in the first
week of February 1997, when 8-month-old Matthew Eappen lapsed into
a coma and later died.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Woodward's mother, Susan, remained secluded in the
family home, while a lawyer released a statement to quash rumors
that the former au pair had sold her story to a British tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contrary to speculation, (Woodward) will not be going into
hiding at the behest of any national newspaper or media
organization,'' said Paul Barrow, the legal adviser to the Louise
Woodward and Family Trust.
</P>
<P>
   The trust, used to pay Woodward's legal expenses, continues to
receive donations. Wednesday, during a regular meeting of Woodward
supporters at the Elton Community Center, volunteers opened several
handfuls of mail, yielding about $1,600 in checks. Woodward friends
said the trust fund _ which once totalled $450,000 _ is now down to
about $50,000 and will be used to pay for the legal battles to
appeal Woodward's conviction or fight the civil suit filed by the
Eappen family.
</P>
<P>
   It was from this trust that Sue Woodward allegedly skimmed
$15,400 using a forged invoice.
</P>
<P>
   Many here say Woodward, who has said that she wants to go to
college, may have a hard time finding work. They argue that selling
her story may be the only way she can make a living. Others say it
would seriously damage her credibility, even among her supporters
here, to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, even some close family friends were less than
jubilant as they awaited her homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved Louise is coming home, but this is no place for
rejoicing,'' said Steve Collins, who took in Woodward's sister,
Vickie, 19, when her parents were in the United States for the
trial. ``Louise could have come home from America the same way she
went over: free. That hasn't happened.''

HOLBROOKE TO REPLACE RICHARDSON AT THE U.N., OFFICIALS SAY

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has decided to name Richard
Holbrooke as the U.S. representative to the United Nations,
replacing Bill Richardson, who will become energy secretary, senior
administration officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will announce the appointments Thursday at a White House
ceremony, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who has decades of foreign policy experience, was the
architect of the Dayton accords that brought a fragile peace to
Bosnia. He is now vice chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston, the
investment bank, and often serves as a special presidential envoy.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is known to have been a strong supporter
of Holbrooke for the U.N. job, which carries Cabinet rank, while
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright initially opposed the
appointment. Sandy Berger, President Clinton's national security
adviser, held his fire, seeing the appointment as inevitable,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Albright helped to block Holbrooke's appointment to the post at
the beginning of Clinton's second term, but was unable to do so
this time. Albright and Holbrooke were originally rivals for the
job of secretary of state, and when she was picked, she was
reported to have felt that Holbrooke would be too disruptive to a
new team.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke speaks freely with reporters and sometimes tries to
move policy in independent ways. The most recent example came in
May in the Balkans, when Holbrooke secured an agreement from
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to talk to ethnic Albanian
leaders in Kosovo by suspending the implementation of sanctions
that Albright had pressed European allies to approve.
</P>
<P>
   That initiative is now widely regarded as a mistake, since
Milosevic used the suspension to begin a crackdown in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   One official, speaking on condition that he not be named,
described Holbrooke as regularly seeking the spotlight and taking
it away from others. He wondered if Clinton's foreign policy team
would be able to keep the image of unity they had worked so hard to
maintain in the second term.
</P>
<P>
   In his second term, Clinton has been more likely to heed his
vice president's advice on personnel matters. Gore and Holbrooke
originally grew close during Gore's failed presidential candidacy
in 1988. But Clinton and Holbrooke are also said to have
established a good relationship.
</P>
<P>
   It was Albright, as representative to the United Nations in
Clinton's first term, who insisted that the job carry Cabinet rank
and that she participate as a full member of the senior foreign
policy team in the so-called ``Principal's Committee.'' She used
the job to build her own reputation for plain-speaking and
telegenic foreign policy sound bites, which helped her become
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   In public, the two praise each other highly, and Holbrooke, in
his recent book about his efforts to bring peace to the Balkans,
``To End a War,'' hailed Albright for her own strong views about
the need to exercise force on behalf of diplomacy and moral values.
And Albright has chosen other strong figures, like Thomas
Pickering, undersecretary for political affairs, to work with.
</P>
<P>
   Berger had also opposed the appointment of Holbrooke to the
United Nations at the beginning of Clinton's second term, but did
not raise serious objections to the appointment this time around,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who is vital to managing the policy differences among
key Cabinet members and maintaining outward unanimity, is said to
regard the new appointment ``as a management exercise,'' an
official said.
</P>
<P>
   But the official acknowledged that the administration is facing
numerous foreign policy challenges, from nuclear proliferation to
economic crises in Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who did not return telephone calls Wednesday, has
told friends that he was stung by criticism that he is not a team
player. He is expected to work hard at dispelling such concerns,
officials said Wednesday. And Holbrooke was praised for his
assiduity, during Bosnia shuttle diplomacy missions, for instance,
at keeping others in the administration aware of what he is up to.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, 57, has been in and out of government since he first
joined the foreign service in 1962 and spent a first tour in
Vietnam. He is best known for his work in Bosnia, when he served as
assistant secretary of state for European affairs. But he also
brings experience in Asia, and also served as assistant secretary
of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs from 1977-81.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke left Washington in 1996 to move to New York and became
vice chairman of Credit Suisse First Boston. He also serves on the
board of Refugees International, a nonprofit organization that
draws attention to the plight of refugees, most recently in Kosovo,
the southern province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson will replace Federico Pena, one of Clinton's
longest-serving Cabinet officers, who announced in April that he
would step down. Pena, a former transportation secretary and mayor
of Denver, said this month that he wants to return to the private
sector, but has not announced specific plans.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was elected to the House of Representatives in 1982
and was re-elected seven times. While still in the House,
Richardson served as a roving diplomatic trouble-shooter for
Clinton, traveling to North Korea, Cuba, Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan
and Burma.
</P>
<P>
   While he was loved at the United Nations for his generosity,
bonhomie and political skill, and in particular for his affinity to
the representatives of the developing world, he was sometimes
criticized internally for being lax on policy and for not
commanding respect on the Security Council.

over San Francisco. Stern, an internationally recognized artist who
uses fire hoses to make artificial rainbows as long as 2,000 feet,
sees rainbows as a symbol of international unity.
</P>
<P>
   His first local effort will be at 8 a.m. Sunday, with water
sprayed from a San Francisco Fire Department boat near the Bay
Bridge. It will be visible from Treasure Island over San Francisco.
At 6 p.m., a San Francisco fire truck at Market and Hyde will be
used to create a rainbow downtown.

<P>
   The Cockettes, first the toast of the gay community, then the

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After toiling for 20 years not exactly anonymously
but far from the bright lights of fame as a freelance journalist,
stand-up comic, playwright, screenwriter and movie director, nobody
is more surprised to see ``Side Man,'' a memory play about jazz
performers, land on Broadway than its author, Warren Leight, 41.
</P>
<P>
   In jazz parlance, sideman refers to a musician who works for
hire on band jobs, who knows the standards by heart and who can
solo dazzlingly but also blend in with an orchestra's sound.
</P>
<P>
   The memories are based on Leight's father, Donald Leight, now
75, a trumpet player who worked with Claude Thornhill, Woody Herman
and other bandleaders through the 1950s. As the author's script
shows, sidemen, who sometimes sabotaged their careers with drugs
and alcohol, gradually became marginalized with the advent of rock
`n' roll.
</P>
<P>
   But the main focus of the play is Leight's own childhood, he
said recently over pastry in a Greenwich Village shop near his
home. Clifford, the author's stand-in (played by Robert Sella),
revisits his past, resuming the peacekeeper role he was forced to
adopt in his parents' crumbling marriage. Ranging between 1953 and
1985, Leight mixes memories of his bitter, often hysterical mother
(Wendy Makkena) and diffident, ineffectual father (Frank Wood) with
a joke-filled celebration of the journeymen musicians he knew as a
child on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my father's friends could remember the horn section from
an obscure gig by such-and-such orchestra,'' Leight said, ``but
would walk right by their own children on the sidewalk and not
recognize them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man,'' directed by Michael Mayer, opens on Thursday at
Stage Right at the Roundabout Theater Company, which is
co-producing it with the Weissberger Theater Group and Peter
Manning. The cast includes Kevin Geer, Michael Mastro, Joseph Lyle
Taylor and Angelica Torn.
</P>
<P>
   In March, when ``Side Man'' had a short run at the CSC theater
Off Broadway, also directed by Mayer, it received excellent
reviews. Shortly after, the screenwriter William Goldman was quoted
in an interview in The New York Times as saying, ``The best play
I've seen in years is Warren Leight's `Side Man.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leight, who has the genial, sometimes abstracted air of a
professional graduate student, has been cautious. ``So many people
have said to me, `This is the next big thing' about my other
projects _ which usually leads to unemployment and unreturned
calls,'' he said with a rueful grin.
</P>
<P>
   For Leight, his play is also autobiographical because: ``I still
see myself as a sideman in many ways. Coming from a jazz family, I
always felt like I should earn a living. So for the last 20 years
I've been a writer-for-hire, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   This may be why ``Side Man'' seems so charitable in its
rendering of Gene, the title character. Peter Marks wrote in his
review in The New York Times that ``when it's over, you look for
heroes and villains, and discover only people.''
</P>
<P>
   Leight's father, who lives west of the theater district in the
Clinton section of Manhattan, recalled an era: ``Sidemen only got
attention inside the industry. In the '30s, the sidemen were also
`names' _ Gene Krupa, for example, was Benny Goodman's sideman _
but 15 years later, sidemen like that were unknown. Like theater
and film, but more so in music, the leaders and headliners get all
the public acclaim, and no one pays attention to who does the dirty
work. Even in the Philharmonic, people are attracted to name
conductors. But how many people can name four or five musicians in
the orchestra?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Side Man'' began as a staged reading in February 1996 in the
basement of the West Bank Cafe on Theater Row. Leight, a member of
the theater group Naked Angels, had had the play sent to Mayer, who
liked it immediately. ``The world he depicts is so truthful, so
idiosyncratic, it completely charmed me,'' Mayer said. After the
reading he directed it next during development at the New York
Stage and Film Company's annual summer season at Vassar College in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where Manning produced it.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer, a recent Tony Award nominee for his direction of ``A View
From the Bridge,'' a Roundabout revival that transferred to
Broadway, said: ``What attracted me to Warren's specific biography
was how universal it is. It's not just a `jazz play' or a
`biographical play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The response from audiences has been, `That's my story.' And I
ask, `Oh, your father was a jazz musician?' And they say, `No, he
was an accountant, but it's still my story.''
</P>
<P>
   Leight jokes about his difficult childhood. ``I was a poor,
scrawny kid from the Upper West Side _ very 10025,'' he said,
referring to the zip code of his youth. ``At least the 10024 kids
had summer camp. I got drop-kicked to Stanford on a scholarship,
but was out of place in Palo Alto with these Olympic team water
polo players.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating in 1977, he returned to New York, sold an
article on ``something like `Where to Find a Public Bathroom in New
York''' to The Village Voice, and became a career writer. The
articles eventually formed the 1983 collection, ``The I Hate New
York Guidebook'' _ ``my first succes d'estime,'' Leight said,
``that's French for `still living in a walkup.'''
</P>
<P>
   His career has included a stint as the His columnist for
Mademoiselle magazine while also writing for National Lampoon,
providing cabaret material for a revue quartet, the High-Heeled
Women, and performing his own stand-up routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a year that was my 90-job year,'' he said. ``At one
point, I was ghostwriting for a guy who suddenly died. His widow
said, `Hurry up, the publishers will get suspicious if the last
installment takes too long.'''
</P>
<P>
   His ``I Hate New York Guidebook'' was the basis, along with
Mayor Ed Koch's memoir, of the 1985 musical ``Mayor.'' ``It was a
hit at the now-defunct Village Gate,'' Leight remembered, ``and
everyone said I wouldn't have to worry about work again _ which
led, after its closing, to a long jobless streak, of course.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he has found sporadic success in Hollywood, but
has always remained a New Yorker. ``I was looking for an apartment
in Manhattan, and I'd see something I liked. Then I'd hear the rent
and think: `Yeah, I can afford that _ two days a week.'''
</P>
<P>
   The experience prompted the screenplay for the 1993 film ``The
Night We Never Met'' (which he also directed), a story of three
people splitting the rent on an apartment but residing in it on
alternate days, starring Matthew Broderick and Annabella Sciorra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, this one was going to be my big break,'' Leight said.
``But it came out two weeks before `Jurassic Park,' so it became
this lovely sand castle that this enormous tsunami washed away.''
</P>
<P>
   After writing horror films and documentaries, Leight wrote a
screenplay for what would become the movie ``Dear God,'' starring
Greg Kinnear, in 1996. ``This was such a humiliating disaster,'' he
said. ``After six or seven drafts, it was taken from me. Suddenly,
there were 60 speaking parts, a dog in a courtroom scene. I sat in
a screening and thought, `Time to write a play where I make no
compromises.'''
</P>
<P>
   The result was ``Side Man.'' ``Film is good money,'' Leight
said, ``but there's a reason: They pay you to go away. `Side Man'
is filled with my voice because it's my story.''
</P>
<P>
   The author's father saw the play at Vassar. ``I didn't want him
to,'' the younger Leight said, ``but an old musician friend told
him, `Hey, your son wrote a play about you. It's in Poughkeepsie.'
My father told me he was up all night afterward. I assumed it was
the not-so-flattering portrayal, and then he said, `Yeah, I
couldn't figure out who was playing trumpet on ``I Remember
Clifford'' in that scene.'''

IRANIAN DIPLOMAT CRITICIZES `HOSTILE' POLICY OF U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAN-ALBRIGHT.) 
(bl) 
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iran's most senior diplomat at the United Nations
came to Washington on Wednesday and accused the Clinton
administration of continuing a ``hostile'' policy toward Iran. He
also defended his country's rejection of Washington's offer for an
official dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech sponsored by Middle East Insight, a magazine,
Mohammad Hadi Nejad Hosseinian, Iran's chief representative at the
United Nations, called the United States ``not in tune with the
rest of the world'' for its pursuit of a policy aimed at isolating
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Nejad Hosseinian needed permission from the State Department to
travel outside the New York area for his first trip to Washington
in his new job, and his remarks reflected both a reticence to make
a positive gesture given the tense domestic political situation in
Iran and a desire to reach out to his American audience.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has moved very cautiously on the initiative announced by
President Mohammed Khatami last January for broad cultural
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   A group of Iranian journalists and editors were tentatively
scheduled to visit the United States for an interview with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright this month. But they were
forced to cancel their trip apparently because of complaints by
Iranian officials opposed to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Nejad Hosseinian did not repeat Iran's
longstanding call for U.S. military forces to withdraw from the
Persian Gulf or to unfreeze Iranian assets held in the United
States. He even appeared to approve of American culture, saying,
``Iranians have very good camaraderie with American and Western
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.N. envoy also praised the administration for
waiving congressionally-mandated sanctions against foreign
companies that invest heavily in Iran's oil and gas sector, he
complained that the beneficial effect was neutralized by the
administration's continuing opposition to using Iran as the
pipeline route for Caspian Sea oil.
</P>
<P>
   As for Washington's offer to begin a government-to-government
dialogue, Nejad Hosseinian said that there was more continuity than
change in America's attitude, ``so we don't think that this
situation, the government-to-government negotiation, is possible
and useful. It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   With four State Department officials present in the audience,
Nejad Hosseinian also faulted the United States for labeling Iran
an official supporter of terrorism, for financing a radio station
that will beam anti-government propaganda into Iran and for what he
said was its failure to recognize Iran's effort to curb drug
trafficking in the region. &QL;

CONVICTED AU PAIR FLIES TO ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a departure as dramatic as her arrival in the public
realm Louise Woodward left the United States Wednesday for the
first time since her arrest last year, a squad of police officers
guarding every step as she boarded a first-class flight to England.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day a federal judge temporarily barred Woodward
from spending any profits she might earn by selling her story. The
ruling _ the first step in a civil suit against Woodward, convicted
of killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen _ signaled the continuation
of a legal epic that is scheduled to last at least through the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward, 20, was legally free to leave. Her criminal case
complete, a $4,301 one-way plane ticket in hand, Woodward walked
from her temporary home in Marblehead and said goodbye to her
criminal attorneys for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is relieved and pleased to be going home,'' said her
former attorney Andrew Good, as Woodward disappeared into a
first-class lounge inside the British Airways terminal at Logan
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The departure marked the end of several days of chaos for both
Woodward and her former employers, Deborah and Sunil Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after both sides appealed Woodward's murder
conviction, the state's highest court on Tuesday upheld Judge
Hiller B. Zobel's decision to reduce Woodward's second-degree
murder conviction to manslaughter and free her after 279 days in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the Supreme Judicial Court, however, sharply
criticized Zobel for several key moves _ including his decision at
trial to remove manslaughter from among the jury's options. A
dissenting opinion also lambasted Zobel for appearing too
sympathetic toward the former au pair and imposing a lenient
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But the SJC opinion let Woodward's criminal conviction stand
without ordering a new sentence. It also allowed her to leave
Massachusetts, where she had remained involuntarily during the
appeals process at the demand of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was getting ready to go to college when this happened,''
said Harvey Silverglate, another former member of the Woodward
defense team. ``She very much wants to return home.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC ruling had another important effect: it prompted the
Eappen family to file a civil suit they had prepared in advance
against Woodward in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens _ who supported Middlesex County prosecutors'
decision to appeal the verdict and who urged the court to return
their former babysitter to prison for the murder of their youngest
son _ filed the suit just 78 minutes after the SJC decision was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They want $75,000 in compensatory damages _ the minimum
required for a civil case filed in federal court _ as well as
unspecified punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks to bar Woodward from ever enjoying profits
she could earn by selling her story of the murder trial. A trial
date inthe civil case has been set for Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Wednesday's hearing in federal court was an
immediate ban on Woodward's ability to sell her story in the United
States and spend the profits. &UR;  &LR; Judge William G. Young granted the
request, imposing a temporary, 12-day ban that also requires
Woodward to notify the court if she sells her story.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he'll revisit the issue June 29 after he studies a
1995 SJC ruling in the case of Katherine A. Power, a fugitive who
admitted she participated in a bank robbery in September 1970 that
left a Boston police officer dead.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the court ruled, a judge properly banned Power
from selling the story of her crime for profit. The judge made the
ban against Power a condition of her probation.
</P>
<P>
   Young's temporary ban, which lawyers for the Eappens say they
are already seeking to extend, won't block Woodward from writing a
book or selling movie rights; it simply forbids her from spending
the profits. The Eappens say that money should be kept in escrow
should they win their civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward ``doesn't have a constitutional right to get any money
from that,'' said an attorney for the Eappens, Frederic L. Ellis.
``It would be kind of like O.J. Simpson saying, `I'm going to write
a book and make $10 million, and I'm not going to give any of that
to the Goldmans.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens have already established a foundation to prevent
child abuse in their son's name. They say any judgment against
Woodward will be deposited there, their lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Wednesday, Judge Young said he believed there was
a ``reasonable likelihood'' that the Eappens can win their first
claim in the civil lawsuit _ that Woodward caused Matthew's death
through ``willful, wanton or reckless conduct.'' Her manslaughter
conviction can be used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   One of Woodward's attorneys, Anthony Doniger, argued that the
order unfairly infringed on Woodward's free speech rights, since
the attorneys for the Eappens have targeted money she might make by
telling her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not seeking to restrain her other assets,'' he said.
``Instead, they're chilling her First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at least, Woodward showed little interest in
exercising her freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   After slipping from the house in Marblehead where she has lived
since late March, Woodward was whisked to the airport in a red
minivan with tinted windows. Police escorts, lights flashing, both
led and trailed her car. A news helicopter hovered overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At Logan, Woodward emerged from the van, her hair down, dressed
in a black pants suit. She kept her eyes trained straight ahead and
ignored questions shouted by reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by seven state troopers, Woodward then swept past
throngs of economy-class passengers waiting in line and heading
straight to the British Airways first-class lounge, complete with a
mini bar. She waited there until boarding her 5:30 p.m. flight.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's one-way ticket was for a first-class seat equipped
with eight movie channels and a VCR, airport officials said. The
special section, sealed off from all but 13 other passengers, also
shielded her from the press.
</P>
<P>
   Under a federal law that prohibits foreigners convicted of
felonies from living in or returning to the United States, Woodward
would have to apply to the government if she wanted to board a
flight back to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although the US Immigration and Naturalization Service has not
yet determined whether Woodward would fall under the ban,
immigration experts said it would be highly unusual for a
manslaughter convict to be allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The elements of her conviction would be reviewed to see if
it was a crime of violence and if she should be admitted to the
country,'' said William Strassberger, an INS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Woodward would want to return to the United States,
where she &UR;  &LR; has by turns been a prisoner, a celebrity and a
lightning rod for public opinion, remained in doubt. She did not,
according to her attorney, ``know what the future will hold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's only 20,'' Good said. ``This won't last forever as an
issue in her life. She'll outlive it.''

STILL ON HIS FEET FOR A LAST DANCE AND NEW CREATION

and Loving the Ballet.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mark Morris Dance Group was just 8 years old and
performing for the first time at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's
Opera House when the company's general manager, Barry Alterman,
spoke about his vision for Morris in New York: ``I want each of
Mark's appearances in town to be an event.''
</P>
<P>
   In the dozen years since Alterman made that remark in the
opera-house lobby, his wish has been granted repeatedly. Wherever
Morris has taken his iconoclastic choreography in New York, the
occasion has been received as something more than just ``the next
season.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, for instance, ``The Hard Nut,'' Morris' alternative
``Nutcracker'' with its pop 1970s design and comic-book wit, and a
concentration of dances to the music of Lou Harrison, centered on
the expansive, specially commissioned ``Rhymes With Silver.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that Morris restricts his eventful
programming to New York. Just before his forthcoming local
appearances, the choreographer and director returned from
California where his company had presented to overwhelming critical
and public acclaim his 1997 staging of Jean-Philippe Rameau's
satirical baroque opera, ``Platee,'' a wildly imagined mix of Greek
gods and swamp creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a Morris double bill at the opera house, Wednesday
through Saturday, with all the makings of still another ``event.''
The run includes Morris' final appearances, sometimes known as
``farewell performances,'' in his danced version of ``Dido and
Aeneas,'' Purcell's 1689 opera.
</P>
<P>
   The 1989 staging, previously seen at the academy's Majestic
Theater in 1990, puts Morris and his dancers center stage and
sequesters the opera's singers with the musicians in the pit;
``empitted'' is Morris' word for the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the bill is the New York premiere of Morris' newest
dance, ``Medium,'' a work for six dancers with references to the
untimely death of Franz Schubert. And as a kind of unmentioned
backdrop to the evening are the circumstances under which
``Medium'' came to be.
</P>
<P>
   Morris created the dance on the heels of his quiet and
much-speculated-about departure earlier this year as director of
Paul Simon's ``Capeman,'' the $11 million Broadway show that folded
in March after eight weeks under the weight of overwhelmingly
negative reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as Morris tells it, he immediately made up ``Medium'''
after the demise of ``Capeman,'' as if to dispel any thoughts that
he was in a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Morris likes to refer to his craft as ``making up dances'' and
to the programming of his works as ``shows.'' He prefers the simple
ring of ``show'' or the flourish of ``spectacle,'' as the French
pronounce it, far more than ``program'' or ``bill.''
</P>
<P>
   At 41, Morris continues to cut what has become a familiar
figure, one projecting an unapologetic and unguarded free spirit.
Arriving for an interview in the cafe he had chosen in his midtown
East Side neighborhood, he sailed in with an imperial flair,
dressed in his signature shower thongs, loose Bermuda shorts and
gauzy shirt. His ringleted, shoulder-length dark hair completed the
immediately recognizable Morris picture.
</P>
<P>
   References to his luxuriant locks, once described to Morris'
amusement as ``fecund curls,'' in fact, figured early in his
discussion of ``Dido and Aeneas.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the dance's premiere in Brussels, Belgium, Morris' hair
has been used to great effect in his playing the dual roles of
Dido, the tragic queen of Carthage, and the Sorceress, the
malevolent witch whose machinations lead to the departure of Dido's
lover, Aeneas, and to the queen's death of a broken heart.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only design change for Morris from Dido to Sorceress
is one for his hair. As Dido, his tresses are informally piled on
his head with a chopstick as a hairpin; for the witch, they're all
unfastened and unruly. ``I could do it in a wig or with add-ons,''
he notes, ``but I never have and never wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   But to get to the larger question: Why is he giving up the
roles? ``Mostly I don't want to do it anymore,'' he says. ``It's a
very, very particular part, and I'm old and ugly, and I was less
old and ugly before. Also, a mundane but legit reason is that I
want to get my hair cut.'' He will not say, however, if his
tonsorial transformation will be as severe as Michael Bolton's.
</P>
<P>
   Morris originally planned ``Dido and Aeneas'' as a solo number
in which he would take on all the roles himself, from chorus to
central characters. In the 16-dancer work he ultimately created _
``a very particular ritual of a dance,'' he said _ Christine Van
Loon, the costume designer, dressed the performers uniformly in an
austere black garment that remains part of the production; Morris
calls it a sarong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sarongs have no elastic,'' he said. ``We have to tie them,
and we don't ever leave the stage, not even for a drink of water.''
</P>
<P>
   He speaks hesitantly about the time when he was choreographing
``Dido and Aeneas.'' Without saying so pointedly, it's clear he
doesn't want to freight his dance with specified sentiments about
terminal illness, like those in ``Still/Here,'' the dance with
video and text by Bill T. Jones, or in the subtler ``Not About AIDS
Dance'' by Neil Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   But Morris recalls the time of ``Dido's'' creation as one in
which he felt panicky. ``I had so many sick and dead friends,'' he
said. In his darker moments back then, he felt certain that he,
too, was ``going to die of AIDS, in like an hour,'' and that
``Dido'' might be his last dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very different now,'' he says. ``I've become much less
superstitious.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Medium'' and ``Dido'' will be separated by an intermission.
```Medium' is about medium length,'' Morris notes with a smile,
saying he'd prefer a long intermission between the works,
suggesting ``an hour and a half, like Glyndebourne,'' the English
summer opera festival with intermissions long enough for patrons to
picnic between acts. ``I want them to have no relation to one
another,'' he says of the two halves of the program, ``although
they both deal with death in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   The music for ``Medium,'' by John Harbison, is titled ``Nov. 19,
1828,'' the date of Schubert's death at the age of 31. Morris says
he will never describe a dance to a journalist, but he does suggest
that clues can be found in the composer's notes accompanying
Harbison's recent CD, ``John Harbison,'' which also includes two
string quartets.
</P>
<P>
   There one learns that the 18-minute work includes distorted
musical references to Schubert's works, as they might have haunted
him on his journey to ``the next world,'' and that the title,
``Medium,'' refers to Harbison; in his notes, he portrays himself
as a go-between for the dead composer and today's audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Morris heard the music first in a recording and found it, he
says, ``so beautifully built, so fabulous and mysterious, so
Schubertian.'' The costumes for the piece's six dancers (Morris
does not perform in this dance) are in muted colors and
translucent.
</P>
<P>
   Morris and the designer for the ghostlike costumes of
``Medium,'' Martin Pakledinaz, a frequent collaborator with Morris,
often find themselves talking about Paul Cadmus' transparent
costumes for a ballet by Lew Christiansen called ``Filling
Station.'' ``I love naked,'' Morris admits. ``I'd love to see
everybody naked all the time.'' When pressed on whether he meant
``naked'' or the more art-historical ``nude,'' Morris emphasizes
``naked, just naked, no clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris will talk somewhat nakedly about the failed ``Capeman.''
His thoughts reflect no ill will. ``I didn't hide,'' he says about
attending the opening night and several subsequent performances of
the show that marked his troubled debut on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Officially he remained the director and choreographer of
``Capeman.'' Unofficially his work was revamped by other hands,
notably those of a more seasoned director, Jerry Zaks. Now he is
content to remark on the generosity of his fellow artists.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls being in the dressing room of some ``Capeman''
performers near the time the show closed on March 28. ``Come on,
guys,''' he remembers saying, ``aren't you a little bit blue, or a
little bit suicidal that you're not being appreciated or that the
show isn't happening?
</P>
<P>
   ``And every one of them in some way said, it's an honor and a
thrill to be performing with these people. So I thought: `Note to
self: Wow! This ship is going down and they are not bitter. Is this
New York?'''
</P>
<P>
   He answers himself by ruminating on what makes New York special
to him as an artist and a citizen. He muses about Seattle, where he
was born, and various American and international locales where he
regularly performs. He contrasts places where people are nice but
not necessarily kind, then concludes: ``New Yorkers are not nice
maybe, but they are kind.''

<P>
   Back in April, I promised to tell you about my class reunion.
It's been 10 years since I waltzed across the stage and received
that awesome sheet of paper that told the world I was finally an
official Doctor of Dental Surgery. Boy, was I a happy camper that
day!
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we all gathered on the plaza with our families to hug
and mug for farewell photos. Finally, my family pinned me down and
tied a string to my foot so I wouldn't float away.
</P>
<P>
   That was in Minneapolis. We moved back to Texas six years ago
and, other than a few Christmas cards, I haven't had much contact
with my colleagues. I didn't even realize that it had been 10 years
until I received the first notice about the reunion. I was thrilled
at the idea of seeing the fellow soldiers who spent four years in
the trenches with me, battling inflexible instructors and
tooth-devouring bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   At the second notice, I went on a diet and started looking for
pictures of my old classmates. My heart sank when I could name only
about 20 of the 85. I knew that most of them would remember me; not
because I was so marvelous, but because I was the only
African-American in the class. During my third year, I was the only
black person in the entire school, but that's another column.
</P>
<P>
   When the big weekend arrived, my family and I flew off to
Minnesota. Once there, we got lost and arrived a little late. When
we walked in, everyone was enjoying social hour. As if on cue,
conversation ceased and every head turned in our direction. My
first thought was, ``They have name tags, thank goodness!''
Everyone smiled and said, ``Hey, Moe!'' transporting me back to the
time when I was with them more than I was at home.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, no Romy and Michelles showed up. Of course, everyone
was at their best, with the trappings of success casually draped
across their bodies. Nevertheless, they looked, you know, human.
One classmate had quit her job to stay home with her children and,
much to her surprise, we were all happy for her. The party animal,
Steve, is now married with children and drives a Suburban. That
really made us happy. All of the skinny people had blossomed,
considerably. That made us real sad. Not.
</P>
<P>
   Last and least was this one insecure fellow who spent the
evening trying to convince everyone that he was the most successful
and important person in the room. He told anyone who would listen
about his great practice, his huge staff, his awesome investments,
his snazzy cars and his incredible home. There's always one, you
know. Eventually, someone told him, ``You win; you're the richest
person here,'' and he finally shut up.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wonderful reunion. Reliving the obstacles I had
overcome helped motivate me for the days ahead. That's what
memories are for, I think; not just reliving, but better living.

 &HT;    U.S. INTERVENES TO PROP UP JAPANESE YEN ON PROMISES OF
STEPPED-UP REFORMS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Worried that the plummeting Japanese currency
threatens to cast a troubled global economy deeper into turmoil,
the Clinton administration made a massive purchase of yen on
Wednesday and dispatched a senior finance official on an emergency
mission to Tokyo to try to rescue the coin of the world's
second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said he authorized the intervention _
estimated by traders at some $2 billion _ after an overnight
telephone call with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who
pledged to undertake long-promised measures to stimulate Japan's
moribund economy and restructure its adled financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said some things which made it clear that he was prepared
to take some bold steps to try to move the Japanese economy
forward, restore growth and opportunity. And I believe in that
context we should be supportive,'' Clinton told reporters following
an unrelated White House Rose Garden event. ''I wanted to send a
clear signal to the markets that the United States supports
Japanese reform, believes the Japanese people can pull out of this
economic slump and restore growth and opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's intervention by the Federal Reserve Bank _ its first
such move meant to affect the yen's value since April 1995 _
sparked a rally on Wall Street, which has swooned over the past two
weeks largely on fears that the slumping yen could deepen the
economic crisis across Asia. The closely-watched Dow Jones
Industrial Average jumped 164.17 points to close at 8829.46.
</P>
<P>
   And the target of the intervention, the Japanese currency,
jumped 7 yen against the dollar, closing in New York at 136.5 yen
to the dollar, after opening in morning trading at 143.5.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Wednesday's intervention, the dollar had risen nearly
80 percent against the yen since the Japanese currency touched its
record high three years ago, with nearly a quarter of the increase
having come this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The White House joined private analysts, however, in warning
that the effect of Wednesday's intervention would be short-lived
unless Tokyo follows through on promised stimulus and reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto told Clinton he was accelerating a massive public
works spending program, stepping up planned tax cuts and making the
politically unpopular move of using taxpayer money to help shore up
Japan's troubled banking system, paralyzed by bad loans
conservatively valued at more than $600 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''This intervention is just a finger in the dike,'' said Sung
Won Sohn, chief economist with the Norwest Corp., a bank holding
company in Minneapolis. ''We should not have a mistaken belief that
this has solved the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, ''The absolute key is that
the Japanese government take the necessary actions with respect to
their economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at a White House briefing, Rubin said,
''The issue isn't our intervention: the issue is what they do. The
only way the problems in Japan will get solved is through what
Japan does.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Rubin sent his deputy, Lawrence Summers, to
Tokyo for a hastily called meeting with his counterparts _ deputy
finance ministers _ from the so-called Group of Seven, or G-7,
industrialized democracies. In addition to the United States and
Japan, the group includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, the administration's point man on the Asia economic
crisis, left Washington Wednesday afternoon and was to arrive in
Tokyo Thursday evening, Japan time.
</P>
<P>
   Summers and his counterparts are huddling with an eye toward the
dire threat the yen's continuing slide poses to a world economy
already reeling from the collapse of currencies across much of Asia
and the threat of a financial meltdown in Russia that could spread
across Central Europe and further squeeze the countries of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the yen continues to slide, this thing will become a plague
on Asia,'' said Sohn. ''A global recession, except for the United
States and Western Europe, is a real possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is China, which has resisted devaluing its
own currency, the renminbi, or yuan, over the past year, in the
face of mounting pressure from the falling yen, Korean won,
Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringit and Thai baht -- all of which
have plunged by more than 40 percent against the dollar over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Those declines have made exports from those countries cheaper,
in dollar terms, than they were a year ago. That's begun cutting
into China's exports, which declined last month for the first time
in two years, slowing economic growth and adding to unemployment
pressures already growing because of Beijing's efforts to wean its
massive worker base from inefficient state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood currency slides have also cut into the crude
oil of China's economic growth, foreign investment, which slid 19
percent in April, as investors from the United States and elsewhere
found that their dollars could go further elsewhere in Asia, where,
in dollar terms, businesses, property and banks have suddenly
become available at fire-sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has put pressure on China to devalue its own
currency, a step economists insist wuld send other Asian economies
tumbling down another flight of steps toward the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the Chinese) are worried about the larger picture in
Asia _ how soon will the recovery begin,'' Nicholas Lardy, senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, told
reporters on Monday. ''As assessments have changed in the region
about how soon that will come about, China is getting more and more
worried about their ability to continue to dodge the bullet, which
is essentially what they've done to date. ''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he had no indications that Beijing was prepared to
devalue the yuan, which was devalued four years ago in a move some
economists contend helped set the stage for the current Asia
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton preparing for a state visit to Beijing next week,
however, many analysts speculated that Wednesday's intervention on
behalf of the yen was a political gesture aimed at showing
solidarity with the Chinese at least as much, if not more so, than
a market move.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a political decision by Clinton to help the
Chinese,'' said Joel Kent, an economist with the New York
investment firm, Lehman Brothers Government Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Many currency traders, who have bet heavily against the yen in
recent months as the White House has steadfastly defended a strong
dollar, were caught flatfooted.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were still getting in, eating their breakfast,'' Kent
said, when the Treasury Department made the first of several
traunches of yen purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's move came just two months after the Bank of Japan
dumped a staggering $18 billion worth of dollar-denominated U.S.
Treasury notes in a single day, in a failed attempt to arrest a
slide in the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's weakness reflects continuing difficulties in the
Japanese economy, second in size only to that of the United States.
Japan's economy has grown little in the past eight years and has
contracted for two consecutive quarters, meeting the formal
definition of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   The image of the U.S. Treasury shoveling billions of dollars at
the yen in an effort to prop up the Japanese currency is a striking
contrast to events a decade ago, when politicians here voiced
strident concerns that Japan was using its powerful currency to buy
up landmark properties and businesses across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan still holds enormous wealth in this country, the result of
decades of direct investment in property and businesses as well as
portfolio holdings in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about in the trillions (of dollars), '' said
Sohn. ''We're talking about huge amounts of money here, so Japan is
not going to go to the poor house.''

Japan does.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, Rubin sent his deputy, Lawrence Summers, to
Tokyo for a hastily called meeting with his counterparts _ deputy
finance ministers _ from the so-called Group of Seven, or G-7,
industrialized democracies. In addition to the United States and
Japan, the group includes Britain, Canada, France, Germany and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Summers, the administration's point man on the Asia economic
crisis, left Washington Wednesday afternoon and was to arrive in
Tokyo Thursday evening, Japan time.
</P>
<P>
   Summers and his counterparts are huddling with an eye toward the
dire threat the yen's continuing slide poses to a world economy
already reeling from the collapse of currencies across much of Asia
and the threat of a financial meltdown in Russia that could spread
across Central Europe and further squeeze the countries of Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the yen continues to slide, this thing will become a plague
on Asia,'' said Sohn. ''A global recession, except for the United
States and Western Europe, is a real possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is China, which has resisted devaluing its
own currency, the renminbi, or yuan, over the past year, in the
face of mounting pressure from the falling yen, Korean won,
Indonesian rupiah, Malaysian ringit and Thai baht -- all of which
have plunged by more than 40 percent against the dollar over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Those declines have made exports from those countries cheaper,
in dollar terms, than they were a year ago. That's begun cutting
into China's exports, which declined last month for the first time
in two years, slowing economic growth and adding to unemployment
pressures already growing because of Beijing's efforts to wean its
massive worker base from inefficient state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood currency slides have also cut into the crude
oil of China's economic growth, foreign investment, which slid 19
percent in April, as investors from the United States and elsewhere
found that their dollars could go further elsewhere in Asia, where,
in dollar terms, businesses, property and banks have suddenly
become available at fire-sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   All of that has put pressure on China to devalue its own
currency, a step economists insist would send other Asian economies
tumbling down another flight of steps toward the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the Chinese) are worried about the larger picture in
Asia _ how soon will the recovery begin,'' Nicholas Lardy, senior
fellow at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank, told
reporters on Monday. ''As assessments have changed in the region
about how soon that will come about, China is getting more and more
worried about their ability to continue to dodge the bullet, which
is essentially what they've done to date. ''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he had no indications that Beijing was prepared to
devalue the yuan, which was devalued four years ago in a move some
economists contend helped set the stage for the current Asia
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton preparing for a state visit to Beijing next week,
however, many analysts speculated that Wednesday's intervention on
behalf of the yen was a political gesture aimed at showing
solidarity with the Chinese at least as much, if not more so, than
a market move.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a political decision by Clinton to help the
Chinese,'' said Joel Kent, an economist with the New York
investment firm, Lehman Brothers Government Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Many currency traders, who have bet heavily against the yen in
recent months as the White House has steadfastly defended a strong
dollar, were caught flatfooted.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were still getting in, eating their breakfast,'' Kent
said, when the Treasury Department made the first of several
traunches of yen purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's move came just two months after the Bank of Japan
dumped a staggering $18 billion worth of dollar-denominated U.S.
Treasury notes in a single day, in a failed attempt to arrest a
slide in the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's weakness reflects continuing difficulties in the
Japanese economy, second in size only to that of the United States.
Japan's economy has grown little in the past eight years and has
contracted for two consecutive quarters, meeting the formal
definition of a recession.
</P>
<P>
   The image of the U.S. Treasury shoveling billions of dollars at
the yen in an effort to prop up the Japanese currency is a striking
contrast to events a decade ago, when politicians here voiced
strident concerns that Japan was using its powerful currency to buy
up landmark properties and businesses across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Japan still holds enormous wealth in this country, the result of
decades of direct investment in property and businesses as well as
portfolio holdings in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are talking about in the trillions (of dollars), '' said
Sohn. ''We're talking about huge amounts of money here, so Japan is
not going to go to the poor house.''

THE NAUGHTY, SURREAL PLEASURES OF THE `PYTHON' 6

 (bl)  
 By JEFF MacGREGOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sex! Violence! Gratuitous nudity!
</P>
<P>
   Like all right-thinking American youngsters, I had these things
much on my mind by the time I reached high school in the early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Back in those ancient, darkling days, however, pre-Springer and
pre-Internet, they were much harder to come by. The shabby
acquisition and shameful consideration of same required a
smuggler's cool, a plausible fake ID and a fistful of bus transfers
to the wrong side of town, where a certain grizzled shopkeeper was
willing to sell us, for a price _ yes _ the comedy albums of Redd
Foxx and Lenny Bruce. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I ran with a slow, if thoughtful, crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Sex! Cannibalism! Gratuitous cross-dressing!
</P>
<P>
   Little wonder then that when ``Monty Python's Flying Circus''
made its stateside television debut a quarter of a century ago on
PBS, my goofball friends and I were galvanized by it.
</P>
<P>
   The smart, naughty silliness of it was unlike anything we'd ever
seen. Hipper and more surreal by far than ``Laugh-In'' or ``The
Smothers Brothers,'' ``Monty Python'' had more in common with the
radio-inflected anarchy of Firesign Theater or the urbane musical
satire of Tom Lehrer.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, it had moving pictures. Best of all, it was
available to us without the plain brown wrapper and could be
studied with relative impunity in the security of one's own rumpus
room. From which plaid-carpeted stronghold every sketch was duly
and painstakingly memorized by us, to be dully and painfully
recited in later performance at our high school talent show. (We
finished a distant and deserving second to a pregnant senior who
sang ``I'm Just a Girl Who Can't Say No.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex! Chartered accountancy! Gratuitous existentialism!
</P>
<P>
   Happily for us all in these more enlightened times, comedy is
off the streets and out of the converted basements and back in the
great museums where it belongs.
</P>
<P>
   The bicoastal Museum of Television and Radio honors the sterling
memory of ``Monty Python's Flying Circus'' beginning Friday with a
three-day marathon presentation of all 45 episodes from the show's
four seasons on the BBC. Then, starting June 30 and running
seriatim through late September in two-week cycles, the museum will
present a dozen composite packages of pre-, post- and
pluperfect-Python material. (The museum's Los Angeles and New York
branches are screening the shows on slightly different schedules.)
</P>
<P>
   These edited shows, bearing titles from the original series like
``Full Frontal Nudity,'' ``Spam'' and ``How to Recognize Different
Trees From Quite a Long Way Away,'' are anchored by classic ``Monty
Python'' episodes but are mostly collaged from cast members' work
before and after the great show itself.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest interest to comedy archaeologists will be the grainy
black-and-white bits from the mid-'60s. Drawn from earlier shows
and sketches written and performed in various combinations by John
Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, Terry Jones and
Terry Gilliam, they chart the origins and nascent sensibilities of
what eventually became the full ``Monty'' in the fall of 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The first screening package, ``Sex and Violence,'' includes
footage from 1967's ``Frost Over England'' with an alarmingly young
(if precociously smarmy) Sir David. The archival value here is in
seeing Cleese as a supporting player in Frost's repertory comedy
company. Tall as a larch and whippet-thin, his face that of an
angular Anglican choirboy, Cleese mugs and bugs his way through
several near-silent sight gags. In evidence throughout is the weird
British synthesis of slapstick and bone-dry sophistication that
later became ``Monty Python's'' hallmark, the apotheosis of which
here is a sketch wherein a dentist (Cleese) chases a patient
chasing a half-clad dental hygienist across the collapsing reality
of a semi-dreamscape. Benny Hill meets Bertrand Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Last the 1948 Show,'' a comedy-variety show also from 1967
starring Cleese and Chapman, is excerpted next (Britcom fans will
be happy to see Marty Feldman back at work). Sending up tradition
is the leitmotif here, the best moment of which _ and I say this
without fear of contradiction _ is a tabernacle performance of the
Olde Englishe Ballade ``I've Got a Ferret Up My Nose.''
</P>
<P>
   Most appealing though, and perhaps most illustrative of what
Python became, are the clips from 1968's ``Do Not Adjust Your
Set.'' Nominally a children's show, it featured Idle, Palin and
Jones as writer-performers. Gilliam is on hand likewise, providing
the animations. Like all good kiddie shows, it works at about nine
levels at once, most of them well above the little nippers' heads.
From a bowdlerized ``King Lear'' to the reductio ad infinitum of
television watchers watching other watchers watch television, the
show puts the sharpest stuff up on the highest shelf, where the
children won't be hurt by it. Those familiar with the medium will
recognize the influences of Ernie Kovacs and Wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Also seen here are what later became tropes of the Python troop:
Palin as an addled counterman, Jones in a giant diaper and, in
utero, the Commonwealth commonplace that Scotsmen aer bonnie foon,
nae matter what they dee. Uh, do.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the compilation is ``Monthy Python'' No. 1, ``Sex
and Violence,'' shown in its hilarious and groundbreaking entirety.
Weirdly, this was also the first episode I ever saw. To this day
the phrase ``That's a depressing prospect for an ambitious sheep''
takes me back to my performance before an auditorium full of
silent, uncomprehending adults, each of whom was no doubt wondering
just exactly what the school board had spent all their tax money
on.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the question at the very heart of the coming
Museum of Television and Radio retrospective. To wit: Is it worth
seeing?
</P>
<P>
   For ardent fans, certainly. The 45 original episodes remain a
high point in the history of comedy television. There hasn't been
another sketch-driven ensemble series anywhere before or since that
so completely succeeded at what it set out to do. Its slippery
logic and post-modern self-awareness pioneered a style that has
never successfully been imitated. Its joyful and singular
appreciation of both lowbrow antic vaudeville and a high-minded
theater of the absurd is a model of the form.
</P>
<P>
   For those devotees who want to track the creative growth of the
writers and performers, the screening packages are an invaluable
resource. So too are they an excellent lesson to the hardy few who
might aspire to the same kind of work. I would, for example, make
it mandatory viewing for everyone on the staff at ``Saturday Night
Live.''
</P>
<P>
   But deconstructing the ways and means of humor can be a dismal
business (witness that last paragraph), especially for the casual
viewer. For the not-quite-convinced-this-is-funny, then, a night or
two of the marathon should suffice to reach a final opinion. If
nothing else, it wouldn't kill you to get out of the house once in
a while, and the museums are good examples of really expensive
architecture.
</P>
<P>
   For those benighted few who remain firm in rejecting every
British import since the lend-lease days, though, no amount of
sermonizing or high-tech, leather-upholstered, museum-quality
viewing will suffice. The true believers like me can spend this
summer in happy abandon, revisiting a misspent youth of silly walks
and crunchy frogs, of nudging and winking and singing the ``Spam''
song, of dancing the fish-slapping dance and parroting back all the
lines we already know by heart.
</P>
<P>
   And when people ask, ``Now what's all this, then?'' we can smile
our secret smiles, because as ``The Complete and Utter History of
Monty Python'' teaches us: It's sex! It's violence! It's gratuitous
existential cannibal cross-dressing!

REPORT CLOUDS CONVICTED AU PAIR'S PRIOR INJURY DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A report published by an independent team of scientists casts
doubt on a central premise of Louise Woodward's criminal defense:
that an infant like Matthew Eappen could suffer a skull fracture
that eventually would kill him, then behave for weeks as if nothing
were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of a prolonged interval of lucidity
between the injury and the onset of symptoms'' in children with
such severe head injuries, said the report in the current New
England Journal of Medicine. ``Thus, an alert, well-appearing child
has not already sustained a devastating acute injury that will
become clinically obvious hours to days later.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, by four physicians at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine, was commissioned by the journal to
respond to the scientific controversy over ``shaken-baby syndrome''
generated by the Woodward case, although the authors did not
specifically address that case. The report, and interviews with its
authors, generally bolster arguments raised by the Woodward
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This article has to answer even the most discerning of
skeptics that the prosecution case of how Matthew died, by
shaking-impact syndrome, is correct,'' said Martha Coakley, one of
the Woodward prosecutors who is now a candidate for district
attorney of Middlesex County in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ayub Ommaya, a Washington neurosurgeon who testified for
the defense, said there are ``holes'' in the journal report that
undermine its conclusions and make clear that ``it is certainly not
the final word.'' While he agreed that ``it is not common'' for an
infant to remain lucid after a severe head injury, Ommaya added
that ``such lucidity has been noted.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the journal article responds to general issues
surrounding ``shaken-baby syndrome,'' which became the center of
focus and confusion during last year's Woodward trial. The authors
say the syndrome is real and responsible for most severe brain
injuries by infants, but they also say a more accurate term is
``shaking-impact syndrome,'' since most damage is done when the
head forcefully strikes a surface.
</P>
<P>
   Can shaking alone cause the severe injuries often lumped as part
of the syndrome? Probably not, the UPenn doctors say, although that
``is still debated'' and severe shaking oftentimes leads to a baby
striking its head against a hard object.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's defense team didn't contest that 8-month-old Matthew
had suffered a severe head injury, but it argued that the injury
that killed him stemmed from a wound as old as three weeks rather
than from anything Woodward did to him before he was hospitalized
and days later died. That issue of whether a baby like Matthew
could die from an earlier severe injury, exacerbated by a
relatively minor later wound, was a key point of contention at the
trial, and was dealt with directly in the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such rare events have been reported in older children and
adults,'' the UPenn authors said. But, they added, ``there is no
evidence that traumatic acute subdural hematoma, particularly that
leading to death, occurs in otherwise healthy infants in an occult
or subclinical manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence rather suggests that, after a truly severe injury,
there is an ``immediate or rapid onset of neurological symptoms,''
the authors wrote. They based that finding in part on a San Diego
study published last year involving 95 children who died from
accidental head injuries. All but one of those children ``had an
immediate decrease in the level of consciousness.'' The one
exception suffered a different injury than Matthew's and died of
surgical complications.
</P>
<P>
   But Ommaya, the former chief of neurosurgery at the National
Institutes of Health, said a far bigger study is needed to test
whether such delays in symptoms occur. ``You can't make a claim
that you can't have a lucid interval,'' he said. ``There are cases
of lucid intervals.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal authors were less definitive with other
symptoms Matthew suffered, such as retinal bleeding. While
published reports suggest that such hemorrhages are found in ``65
to 95 percent of patients'' with shaken-baby syndrome, the authors
wrote, they are not by themselves proof of the syndrome and it is
tough to tell how long ago the bleeding began.
</P>
<P>
   What about the fact that Matthew did not have severe injuries to
the neck and upper vertebra, or obvious marks on his scalp, which
Woodward's lawyers say proved he was not a victim of shaken-baby
syndrome?
</P>
<P>
   The journal article says that when the surface the baby strikes
is soft, like a couch pillow, ``the force of the impact is widely
dissipated and may not be associated with visible signs of surface
trauma, even though the brain itself decelerates rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   As for neck and vertebra damage, ``it's too ill-defined to say
you have to have a neck injury,'' said Dr. Cindy W. Christian, an
author of the journal article and head of the child abuse program
at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ``I don't believe those
things have ever been described as necessary components for this
diagnosis'' of shaken-baby syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Angell, the New England Journal's editor-in-chief, said
she recruited the authors of the article because they were
independent experts who the journal felt could help shed light on a
subject made even more controversial by the Woodward case.
</P>
<P>
   Such a neutral review was called for in the aftermath of the
trial by Harvey Silverglate, one of Woodward's lawyers. But
Wednesday Silverglate said that what he wanted, and still wants, is
a review not of generic shaken-baby issues like the journal
published, but one where independent scientists examine specific
evidence in the Woodward case, none of which the UPenn researchers
saw.

PHOTOS OF HIV MOLECULES RAISE HOPE FOR VACCINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After five years of effort, scientists unveiled the first
detailed pictures of a spiky molecule on the surface of the AIDS
virus that allows it to infect human immune cells _ a great boost,
they say, for designing effective vaccines and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, considered a technical tour de force, has already
revealed secrets of how this critical part of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) docks like a spaceship with
complementary molecules on target cells while defending itself
against immune attack. It also suggests why vaccines against HIV so
far have been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare tribute to the achievement's importance, the new
pictures of the HIV molecule adorn the covers of both the current
British journal Nature, published Thursday, and its US rival
Science, appearing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you get the three-dimensional structure of an
important molecule like this, you're many steps ahead,'' said Dr.
Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government's leading AIDS researcher.
``It brings us much closer to things we've had to surmise about.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar feat _ scientists' ability in the late 1980s to grow
three-dimensional crystals of an HIV enzyme called protease _ led
to the development of protease inhibitors. These drugs, used in
combination with others, have drastically cut AIDS deaths rates and
transformed the course of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   To capture pictures of GP120, researchers had to grow it in
crystal form, a challenge for a protein molecule as convoluted and
complex as this one. The molecule measures 1/200-millionth of an
inch across; each AIDS virus bristles with 216 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Fauci and others predicted the most important application will
be in what scientists call ``rational'' vaccine design.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in the top tier of scientific achievements in the
field,'' commented Dr. Robert C. Gallo, director of the University
of Maryland's Institute of Human Virology. ``It will help us induce
antibodies of the right type for vaccine purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading AIDS vaccine candidate, OK'd last month by federal
officials for the first widespread human trials, is based on GP120,
so named because it is a glycoprotein, or sugar-protein complex.
</P>
<P>
   .
</P>
<P>
   However, this experimental vaccine does not contain GP120 in its
natural three-dimensional form, which leads some critics to doubt
it will be effective.

   ``All the defenses the virus has built around this molecule are
exactly the same things'' that make a vaccine based on GP120
ineffective, said Joseph Sodroski of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute
in Boston, a leader of the multicenter effort. ``Knowing what those
defenses are will focus our efforts to improve this molecule as a
vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Hendrickson of Columbia University, another member of the
team, said most people infected with HIV make antibodies that
target ``decoys'' on the surface that GP120 presents to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people generate antibodies to parts of GP120 that are
changeable, or parts that are not displayed when the virus is in an
infective state,'' Hendrickson said. The new pictures of GP120
reveal antibody targets that don't change from one HIV strain to
the next and are vital to the virus's ability to get inside human
cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is that these regions will elicit the right kinds of
antibodies that can neutralize the virus,'' Hendrickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing what GP120 looks like in molecular detail also gives
scientists new targets for designer drugs that foil HIV in novel
ways. For instance, the pictures reveal the docking site for a
molecule called CD4 that protrudes from the surface of certain
immune cells.
</P>
<P>
   The site resembles a ball-and-socket joint, suggesting that if a
drug could be designed to fit the socket on GP120 it could block
infection.
</P>
<P>
   The new pictures also reveal how GP120 is sugar-coated with an
``icing'' that prevents antibody recognition.

A NEW, IF NOT IMPROVED, USE OF STEREOTYPES IN FILM

   Welcome to ``Meantime.'' The title of Mike Leigh's scathingly
funny early-'80s assault on Thatcherism might just as well describe
our own age. We live in a time when bullies are in fashion and
creative work that addresses social injustice or the validity of
someone else's suffering is likely to meet with braying accusations
of ``victim art'' and ``political correctness.''
</P>
<P>
   Some filmmakers accommodate themselves to such a climate by
deploying, with a wink and a naughty grin, the sort of stereotypes
that began to disappear from movies 30 years ago and that to some
of us at least, can't be redeemed by any amount of post-modernist
irony or neo-noir chic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others persist in burrowing beneath cliche, although as
any artist who has made the effort will tell you, confronting
stereotypes has always been a far trickier proposition than
trafficking in them. Stereotypes don't spring full grown from the
foreheads of bigots. They're a kind of estrangement, but they form
around a core of recognizable fact, borrowing fact's credibility
even as they distort its truth. Their presence in a film can seem
positively cutting edge while playing to some of our laziest and
worst assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Gifted, and disparate, directors such as Quentin Tarantino and
Spike Lee regularly spice up their films and their reputations for
audacity with a touch of bad attitude here, some in-your-face
bigotry there. Sometimes it makes artistic sense; often it doesn't.
A little racism, a touch of misogyny, it's hip, it's bold, it's
real. It's the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   But one hipster's cutting edge is another's mortal insult. In
``Jackie Brown,'' Tarantino got a little too real for Lee, who
complained about the number of times Samuel L. Jackson's grouchy
arms dealer used the word ``nigger'' in a single speech (27).
Tarantino could retaliate by pointing out that while the men in
``He Got Game'' are richly developed characters, the women are a
laundry list of types (noble dead black mom, treacherous living
black girlfriend, white hooker with heart of gold, busty white
babes with brains of air). He could, but he won't.
</P>
<P>
   In very different ways, three current films use stereotypes to
give themselves an edge they would otherwise lack. All are bold and
well intentioned, but they vary wildly in the ways they confront
conventional expectations or cater to them.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's new animated feature ``Mulan,'' based on a
fifth-century Chinese poem about a young woman warrior who defeats
an invading Hun army and saves her country, consciously sets out to
turn at least one stereotype on its head; ``Smoke Signals,''
written, directed and starring young American Indians, serves up
its stereotypes with a 400-year-old vengeance, while Warren
Beatty's buoyantly comic political satire ``Bulworth'' ultimately
sinks beneath their unexamined weight.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a recent press screening of ``Mulan,'' a reporter
asked the only child in the room, a boy named Johnny, what he
thought of the movie's eponymous heroine. Mediawise beyond his
eight years, Johnny gave his questioner a patient look and said:
``I liked her OK It didn't bother me that she was a girl.'' Then he
blurted: ``But I really liked the bad guy. He was great!''
</P>
<P>
   Shan-yu, the movie's ruthless villain, certainly is great. He's
a real walk on the wild side, huge and powerful and not unhandsome,
if your tastes run to razor-sharp incisors and fierce yellow eyes.
But the news here is that his unlikely opponent is pretty great,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Stereotypes play to our fears and anxious desires; role models
try to pretend they don't exist. More dutiful than inspired, role
models usually make poor substitutes for good art.
</P>
<P>
   But Mulan came into existence under the watchful, combative eye
of Pam Coats, one of Disney's few female animation producers. And,
like her protector, Mulan is an exception to the rule. An only
child who disguises herself as a man and goes off to war to spare
her aging, battle-scarred father, Mulan is clever, generous,
passionate and determined. But she's a good deal more than that;
she's also vulnerable and funny, showing flashes of irony and
slapstick humor. She's the best animated heroine in Disney's
history not because she's the most politically proper but because
she's the most fully imagined.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is rich with unexpected payoffs. One of the best is a
sequence in which Mulan, trying to be a dutiful daughter, goes to a
marriage broker to be made into a perfect bride. In a conventional
Disney cartoon, this would be the all-important transformation
scene that little girls wait for, the one in which Beauty or
Cinderella or even Belle gets to put on the fabulous dress and the
upswept hairdo and go out there and win the heart of the prince.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, Mulan emerges dressed to the nines, and her
traditionally painted face _ white powder, red rosebud lips and
dramatically shadowed eyes _ looks exquisite.
</P>
<P>
   But love isn't the first concern of the character Mulan (or the
film ``Mulan''), and so the scene subverts the convention. Not only
does it happen way too soon in the story; there's not a prince in
sight, and the marriage broker is no kindly fairy godmother but a
fuming bully who will eventually write Mulan off as insufficiently
demure, in effect setting her free.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Mulan's transformation feels like anything but a
triumph. True, she has been made beautiful, but in the process she
has been obliterated. She has literally disappeared into a generic
feminine ideal, a stereotype of sorts, and it's startling how
sharply one feels the loss of her real face, which isn't generic at
all but distinctively flat and strong and appealingly expressive.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, which plays out with some terrific cartoon slapstick,
resonates with all sorts of disturbing questions about beauty and
identity and female shame. But then, ``Mulan'' itself resonates
with an implicit reproach to a country where women are so
undervalued that orphanages abound with discarded baby girls. And
those are the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   There's a raffish little dragon in ``Mulan,'' something of a
flimflam artist and _ a staple of Disney's contemporary animated
features _ an ethnic joker who supplies the hero with a comic foil
and the movie with lots of raucous humor. In this case, the
ethnicity belongs to Eddie Murphy, whose voice makes Mushu the
dragon very black, very street and very motor mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In a movie devoted to upending cliches, Murphy's Mushu is at
first a disconcerting presence. It seems a very cheap joke that the
only black voice in the movie should be rattling away nervously,
trying to curry favor with a bunch of dignified, disdainful Asians.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Murphy himself is the solution to the problem. He
can't save a bad script, but he can make a good one hilarious; he
individuates Mushu, giving him such a distinctive personality
(sarcastic, exuberant, skeptical, scared, nervy, antic) that it
seems perfectly natural, as well as funny, when the little dragon
salutes one of Mulan's battlefield achievements by squealing, ``You
the man,'' immediately adding, sotto voce, ``Well, sort of.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Bulworth'' could have used Eddie Murphy. But with Murphy
around, Warren Beatty could not have dominated the proceedings as
thoroughly as he does. With some justice, ``Bulworth'' is billing
itself as ``the best-reviewed movie of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also turning out to be one of the most contentious. It has
drawn more boos than raves from black writers, as well as a
fence-straddler by Henry Louis Gates Jr. in The New Yorker. The
most devastating critique was that of essayist Stanley Crouch, whom
no one has ever accused of being politically correct. In a furious
New York Daily News column that took the movie apart, Crouch called
``Bulworth'' ``a Tarzan movie'' that ``pretends to a certain
above-it-all hipness while making sure that there are no Negroes
equal to or superior to the main white character.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Beatty has put his money, his glamour and his
considerable talent into a film that means to fight the good fight,
attacking the corruption of American politics, highlighting the
racial divide in American life and showcasing the kind of undiluted
liberal passion that Bill Clinton jettisoned well before his hair
turned gray. Furthermore, he has done it with the most effective
weapon, ebullient humor, much of it at the expense of his own
vanity.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. For if the suicidal senator with a sudden mania
for telling the truth is a clownish figure who shows every minute
of Beatty's 61 years, in no time at all his truth-telling turns him
into the great white savior of all the black folk he meets. The
sort of black folk who are front and center in ``Bulworth'' are in
need of saving: drug dealers and the children who work for them;
gangsta rappers and their sexy ladies partying the night away; and
everybody's poor but honest elders, briefly glimpsed being lectured
by Bulworth at church or in their humble, heavily barred homes as
they gather over their ham hocks and greens.
</P>
<P>
   The depths of ego-blinkered condescension in ``Bulworth'' can
hardly be plumbed without a diving tank. Predictably, the silly old
wreck of a senator still gets the girl _ in this case, a beautiful
hip-hop fly girl played by Halle Berry, who is 32 years younger
than Beatty. ``You're my nigger,'' she says fondly, in the line
most likely to remind you that Beatty was a co-writer of the
script.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not enough for Beatty to get the girl; he must get the
guy as well. Witness the presto-chango transformation of the nasty
neighborhood drug dealer (Don Cheadle) into a noble neighborhood
activist, a metamorphosis triggered by (what else?) one of the
senator's lectures.
</P>
<P>
   In the America of ``Bulworth,'' there is barely a black middle
class, no upper middle class and certainly no power elite. No black
executives, black thinkers, black politicians. Most of all, there
are no black saviors. In this well-meaning, racist cartoon, Beatty
not just the man, he the only man.
</P>
<P>
   To understand what Beatty did and did not do, just replace Halle
Berry with Pam Grier (in a sense, Tarantino did this in ``Jackie
Brown'' and created the most resonant female character of his young
career).
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, put them both in the film with the aging white hero
(Ms. Grier could slip right into the plot as a Carol Mosley Braun
figure) and get the sex, race and power issues right out there for
everybody to thrash through instead of trying to sneak past them
with a single, laughably furtive reference (``I'm too old for
you,'' Beatty mutters as he and Ms. Berry ride off into the
narrative sunset).
</P>
<P>
   A political farce that reflected the diversity of black society
is most likely to be made by a black director, and that's at once a
good thing and a bad one. It is crucial for people to be able to
take charge of their own narratives: women describing women's
lives, blacks describing black experience. At the same time, if
that's all that happens, then as a culture we are well lost, to one
another and to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Alexie wouldn't agree. A member of the Spokane tribe
who, at 31, has published 10 well-received books of poetry, fiction
and essays, Alexie is vocal in his disdain for whites whose work he
sees as simplifying and romanticizing Indian life. He has suggested
that they find their own creation myths and leave American Indians
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie has a point. If the stereotypes that obscure the reality
of African-Americans are belittling or hostile, American Indians
are most likely to find themselves smothered in sentimentality. The
most famous example of this is a prize-winning public service
commercial from the late 1960s that showed a noble Indian shedding
a single artful tear for an environment ruined by whites.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most egregious is Disney's ``Pocahontas,'' released
three years ago, which not only sentimentalized its Indians but
also made a strapping, blond Capt. John Smith its real hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' filmed on the Coeur d'Alene reservation in
Idaho by Chris Eyre and written by Alexie (he was also a
co-producer), is a pungent antidote to all that. The story of two
young men and their strained, competitive search for a lost father,
it shoves every cliche about Indians in your face and propels you
to chew on the implications.
</P>
<P>
   Alexie's fiction, which is partly drawn from his life, has
sparked resentment for its unflattering portraits on the Spokane
reservation where he grew up. ``Smoke Signals'' is unlikely to
change that. It shows us fat Indians, poor Indians, Indians
drinking themselves into a lethal stupor, Indians becalmed in the
middle of the vast, empty nowhere they call ``the rez.'' Its
perspective _ that of the children who view their elders with love,
anguish and rage _ is anything but sentimental.
</P>
<P>
   It is the filmmakers' mordant joke that the characters in
``Smoke Signals'' talk incessantly about what it is to be an
Indian, and when they aren't talking about that, they talk about
white people and what white people think an Indian is. Much of this
is shocking and clever; some of it is slyly hilarious (young
basketball players sitting around after practice suddenly start to
chant, ``General George Custer is guarding me, General George
Custer is guarding me''). And no matter who's watching, some of it
stings. The movie is no easier on white people than it is on
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smoke Signals,'' which was a double winner at this year's
Sundance festival and will be released by Miramax on Friday,
deserves many of the adjectives lavished on ``Bulworth'' _ words
like ``radical,'' ``driven,'' ``original'' and ``outrageous.'' It
is a genuinely audacious piece of work, summoning up stereotypes in
order to ransack them for their real, complicated meaning. If the
viewer sometimes flinches, the filmmakers don't. The truth can hurt
as much as any lie, and the truth that shapes the world of ``Smoke
Signals'' is the horrific history of white and Indian in America.
Eyre and Alexie have made a funny, inventive and, ultimately, a
fair film about the legacy of that history.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story of lost fathers and of what such fathers might
leave to their sons _ a legacy more valuable than the sons might
allow themselves to imagine but tainted nonetheless. The vanquished
pass on the stigma not only of their defeat but of their failure to
overcome it. For a white audience, ``Smoke Signals'' suggests
something else: so do the victors.

INDIA'S DEFENSE MINISTER CALLS U.S. DEFENSE POLICIES
`HYPOCRITICAL'
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOHN F. BURNS     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ India's defense minister said Wednesday that
President Clinton should explain why the United States believes
that it can ``trust China with nuclear weapons'' while imposing
economic sanctions on India for seeking a nuclear deterrent against
threats from its nuclear-armed neighbors, China and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking a week before Clinton is to leave Washington to visit
China, Defense Minister George Fernandes said American policies on
nuclear weapons were ``hypocritical'' because they sought to
entrench the arsenals of the five established nuclear powers while
shutting out countries like India that believe they need nuclear
weapons for their own defense.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes said Indian leaders had noted recent news reports in
which Clinton administration officials had spoken of the United
States and China becoming ``strategic partners'' and of plans for
an agreement that neither side would aim nuclear missiles at the
other.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Fernandes said, the United States was leading
efforts to punish India with economic sanctions for its underground
nuclear tests last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask Bill Clinton only one question,'' Fernandes said
in an interview in his office. ``And it would be this: Why is it
that you feel yourself so close to China, that you can trust China
with nuclear weapons, just as you can trust yourselves with nuclear
weapons, and you can trust the Russians and the French and the
British, but you cannot trust India?''
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Fernandes hinted at the kind of nuclear
arsenal India intends to develop in the wake of the five nuclear
tests it conducted, and the six tests Pakistan says it carried out
in response.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Indian arsenal would be only large enough to act as
a deterrent to potential aggressors, and that India would not get
drawn into the kind of nuclear arms race that led the United States
and the Soviet Union to amass huge nuclear stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   He said India had learned the lessons of the Cold War. ``The
United States, with all the might of its nuclear weapons, had to
finally get out of Vietnam, and Russia had to surrender, of all
people, to the Chechens,'' he said. ``So it is an established fact
that any country that has nuclear weapons cannot use them. By
definition, they can be used only as a deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``If we had to go nuclear, it was for the purpose of
possessing a nuclear deterrent that would enable us to tackle some
of the threats that we faced, only that.'' He described these
threats as coming primarily from ``across the border to the
north,'' meaning from China, and from Pakistan, which he said had
been aided by transfers of nuclear and missile technology from
China.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks were in line with the toned-down approach India has
adopted since euphoria over the nuclear tests began to subside.
Immediately after the tests, Fernandes said India intended to place
nuclear warheads atop its missiles. But recently, India's emphasis
has been on its readiness to negotiate on nuclear issues with
Pakistan and the five established nuclear powers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fernandes refused to go into details on the number of nuclear
warheads India felt it needed, or how they would be deployed. But
in response to a question, he said India's approach would follow
what defense analysts here have described as ``recessed
deterrence.''
</P>
<P>
   The term has been used here to describe a nuclear arsenal
powerful enough to deter aggressors but not so large as to impose
crippling economic costs. Many Indian experts have said that an
arsenal of this kind could be ``warehoused'' to be deployed only in
a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   India would be prepared to forgo even this ``minimal''
deterrent, Fernandes said, if the established nuclear powers agreed
to renegotiate existing nuclear limitation agreements to provide
for the elimination of all nuclear arsenals. This has been India's
policy for decades, but it has been rejected by the United States
and the other nuclear powers, which have insisted on the right to
maintain their arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandes, 68, leads a small socialist party that is one of 14
in India's ruling coalition. He acknowledged that he had been a
long-standing opponent of nuclear weapons, to the point of having
participated in protests and sit-ins against nuclear arms in India
and abroad when he was an opposition politician.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that he could not accept the attitude of Western
powers on nuclear issues, which seemed to be that they were
responsible enough to handle nuclear weapons, while India and
Pakistan were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why India and Pakistan should be seen as blowing
each other up, when nuclear weapons in the hands of the United
States and China are seen as stabilizing factors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the nuclear standoff between the United States and
the Soviet Union during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, he added:
``Even at the height of the Cold War, everybody kept their cool,
even at the 11th hour. Now to believe that this is a prerogative
reserved to nations that have 10,000 nuclear warheads each, and not
to nations that don't even have a stockpile, that is unfair.'' &QL;

   &QL;  DEMOCRATS PUSH FOR CHANGES TO 1996 FARM BILL
</P>
<P>
   By Elizabeth Hurt
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 17 -- Farmers can blame their dwindling prices
on the Republican Freedom to Farm Act of 1996, according to the
leading Democrats in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Farm income has plummeted in more than 30 states since the bill
was signed, said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing crisis in rural America. We believe very
strongly this is a direct result of the Freedom to Farm Act,''
Daschle said. ``There should be no question: the Freedom to Farm
Act was enacted -- prices have fallen.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 law reduced federal subsidies for farmers in the cases
of low crop prices, capped loan programs, and eliminated
restrictions on the quantity farmers could produce.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans contend that now is not the time to debate the
Freedom to Farm Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farm bill should not be opened right now,'' said Jennifer
Cutshall, spokeperson for the Senate Committee on Agriculture,
Nutrition and Forestry. ``These problems are state-specific
situations and should not be addressed by the whole farm bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Farm Bureau Federation is also wary of adjusting
the farm bill, as stated in a letter from AFBF President Dean
Kleckner to Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Sen. Richard
Lugar, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers are better off with the flexibility allowed by the farm
bill, said Kleckner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is working as designed,'' wrote Kleckner. ``It is extremely
important that market forces be allowed to work so that a demand
base can be built. Otherwise, agriculture will not be a growth
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Daschle said Democrats from farm states will introduce a package
of legislation that will reinstate a safety net for farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The 1996 bill) has thrown (farmers) to the whim of an
unpredictable market, unpredictable weather and unpredictable
conditions overseas,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, ranking
minority member of the Senate Agriculture Committee. ``We need to
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The package includes eliminating caps on marketing loans for
farmers and creating an indemnity fund for farmers suffering income
losses. The senators had not worked out the details on the
legislative package, including the estimated cost.
</P>
<P>
   The group hopes to push for the legislation before the year is
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a full-court press. We are going to keep
introducing these and we are not going to let up,'' said Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minnesota. ``We are talking about broken dreams and
broken lives. People are losing their farms.''

EXHIBIT A (AS IN ART) IN A CASE FOR CONSERVATION

<P>
   Nearly lost in the sprawling suburbs and high-tech industrial
parks of Orange County, Calif., is the unassuming Irvine Museum.
Tucked away on the 12th floor of a glass office tower between John
Wayne Airport and the San Diego Freeway, it provides an unlikely
setting for the world's largest collection of California
Impressionist paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of the finest works of this underappreciated genre
have reached New York, bringing their airy palettes and play of
California light to the National Academy Museum in a show titled
``All Things Bright and Beautiful: California Impressionist
Paintings From the Irvine Museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectively these paintings testify to the energy and passion
of the little-known California Impressionists of 1890 to 1930.
Their work reveals a reverence for the state's landscape, so often
washed in its celebrated white light.
</P>
<P>
   But the paintings tell another story too _ that of an
iron-willed, sometimes combative real estate heiress named Joan
Irvine Smith, whose family once owned the immense ranch upon which
the modern city of Irvine, Calif., is built. Several of the 58
works on view here, selected from Mrs. Smith's 3,000-piece
collection, were painted on the Irvine Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smith believes that the paintings, inspired by the
unsullied valleys, virgin mountains and deserted coastline of
early-20th-century California, bear witness to much of what the
state has lost forever. She sees the art as an effective tool for
teaching environmental preservation and balanced development. And
she is the first to point out that most of her millions came from
developing parts of the very land that she now hopes these
paintings can help rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservation must be done in a way that doesn't destroy the
economy,'' said Mrs. Smith, whose mother was a prominent Republican
but who considers herself politically independent. ``A strong
economic base is needed to support environmental preservation, but
you must have a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The art, she said, ``is a soft sell, a necessity to preserve the
environment, not by hitting people over the head but as a form of
consciousness-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes people think how imperative preservation really is,''
she added.
</P>
<P>
   Some native Californians who visit the museum, she said, ``see
the paintings and say, `Ah, this is what it looked like when I grew
up!' Then they compare it to what is going on out there day by
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out there'' is visible through the museum's windows: a
sometimes smoggy panorama of housing tracts and clogged freeways
bordered by scarred mountains and, here and there, patches of the
remaining natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always this way. The National Academy exhibition, on
view through July 9 before moving to Chicago, depicts a seemingly
mythical land of milky skies and honey hills. It betrays the
artists' near-religious awe of all they saw around them. And it
shows their mastery at depicting the rare light, shadows and color
of California, especially the coral rays of the setting sun
catching distant peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Artists began arriving in California after the 1849 gold rush,
many settling in San Francisco. Most of them had received formal
training in New York or Chicago, and several had lived and painted
in France _ in Paris and Giverny _ where they were influenced by
Claude Monet.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, artists in Southern California, most notably in Santa
Barbara, Pasadena, San Diego and Laguna Beach (near Irvine), began
experimenting with the Impressionist style. Soon after, Northern
California artists also began to adopt the style, first in San
Francisco and later in artist colonies formed in Monterey, Carmel
and other places outside the city after much of it was destroyed in
the earthquake and fires of 1906.
</P>
<P>
   Like the French Impressionists, the Californians used bold new
pigments, large, contrasting blocks of light and shadow, and broken
brush &UR;  &LR; strokes that sometimes only hinted at objects. And like the
French, they weren't always appreciated by the art establishment.
These artists largely shunned figurative and studio painting,
preferring instead to carry their easels outside in the ``plein
air'' fashion and paint the landscapes and seascapes around them.
</P>
<P>
   The artists ``sought to capture a fleeting moment of specific
natural light,'' said Jean Stern, executive director of the Irvine
Museum. ``The clear and intense light appears often in these
paintings. It defined the landscape. The biblical analogy of light
as the creative instrument is appropriate. Without it, and the
divine energy it represented, the land would not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   A stirring spirituality permeates many of the works and
testifies to the artists' faith not only in God but in the sheer
grandeur of nature. The German-born painter William Wendt is
probably best known for such ``artistic moralism.'' A founding
member of the Laguna Beach Art Association in 1918, he became known
for his depictions of rugged coastal hills, often basking in the
warm glow of sunset. Even his titles, like ``The Silent Summer Sea,
1915'' and ``There Is No Solitude, Even in Nature, 1906,'' reveal a
certain religious poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known, best-loved and probably the best artist of the
school was a native Californian, Guy Rose, who spent eight years at
Giverny, though he probably never painted with Monet. Traveling up
and down California, he perfected the feathery brush strokes of
early Impressionism, incorporating delicate purples, blues and
pinks. Like Monet, he often did serial paintings of the same scene
at different times of day. With six works in the show, he is its
most represented artist. His ``Laguna Eucalyptus, 1916'' and
``Point Lobos, 1918'' are among the exhibition's highlights.
</P>
<P>
   Another notable artist in the show is Granville Redmond, who
could not hear or speak and who suffered bouts of depression. He
preferred the moody, tonalist paintings seen in his dark yet
intensely spiritual ``Nocturne,'' but he knew that wealthy patrons
wanted his sunny trademark panoramas of poppy fields below
snow-covered mountains, exemplified in the mural-like ``California
Landscape With Flowers.''

REPORT CLOUDS CONVICTED AU PAIR'S PRIOR INJURY DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A report published by an independent team of scientists casts
doubt on a central premise of Louise Woodward's criminal defense:
that an infant like Matthew Eappen could suffer a skull fracture
that eventually would kill him, then behave for weeks as if nothing
were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence of a prolonged interval of lucidity
between the injury and the onset of symptoms'' in children with
such severe head injuries, said the report in the current New
England Journal of Medicine. ``Thus, an alert, well-appearing child
has not already sustained a devastating acute injury that will
become clinically obvious hours to days later.''
</P>
<P>
   The article, by four physicians at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine, was commissioned by the journal to
respond to the scientific controversy over ``shaken-baby syndrome''
generated by the Woodward case, although the authors did not
specifically address that case. The report, and interviews with its
authors, generally bolster arguments raised by the Woodward
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This article has to answer even the most discerning of
skeptics that the prosecution case of how Matthew died, by
shaking-impact syndrome, is correct,'' said Martha Coakley, one of
the Woodward prosecutors who is now a candidate for district
attorney of Middlesex County in eastern Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Ayub Ommaya, a Washington neurosurgeon who testified for
the defense, said there are ``holes'' in the journal report that
undermine its conclusions and make clear that ``it is certainly not
the final word.'' While he agreed that ``it is not common'' for an
infant to remain lucid after a severe head injury, Ommaya added
that ``such lucidity has been noted.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the journal article responds to general issues
surrounding ``shaken-baby syndrome,'' which became the center of
focus and confusion during last year's Woodward trial. The authors
say the syndrome is real and responsible for most severe brain
injuries by infants, but they also say a more accurate term is
``shaking-impact syndrome,'' since most damage is done when the
head forcefully strikes a surface.
</P>
<P>
   Can shaking alone cause the severe injuries often lumped as part
of the syndrome? Probably not, the UPenn doctors say, although that
``is still debated'' and severe shaking oftentimes leads to a baby
striking its head against a hard object.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's defense team didn't contest that 8-month-old Matthew
had suffered a severe head injury, but it argued that the injury
that killed him stemmed from a wound as old as three weeks rather
than from anything Woodward did to him before he was hospitalized
and days later died. That issue of whether a baby like Matthew
could die from an earlier severe injury, exacerbated by a
relatively minor later wound, was a key point of contention at the
trial, and was dealt with directly in the article.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such rare events have been reported in older children and
adults,'' the UPenn authors said. But, they added, ``there is no
evidence that traumatic acute subdural hematoma, particularly that
leading to death, occurs in otherwise healthy infants in an occult
or subclinical manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The evidence rather suggests that, after a truly severe injury,
there is an ``immediate or rapid onset of neurological symptoms,''
the authors wrote. They based that finding in part on a San Diego
study published last year involving 95 children who died from
accidental head injuries. All but one of those children ``had an
immediate decrease in the level of consciousness.'' The one
exception suffered a different injury than Matthew's and died of
surgical complications.
</P>
<P>
   But Ommaya, the former chief of neurosurgery at the National
Institutes of Health, said a far bigger study is needed to test
whether such delays in symptoms occur. ``You can't make a claim
that you can't have a lucid interval,'' he said. ``There are cases
of lucid intervals.''
</P>
<P>
   The New England Journal authors were less definitive with other
symptoms Matthew suffered, such as retinal bleeding. While
published reports suggest that such hemorrhages are found in ``65
to 95 percent of patients'' with shaken-baby syndrome, the authors
wrote, they are not by themselves proof of the syndrome and it is
tough to tell how long ago the bleeding began.
</P>
<P>
   What about the fact that Matthew did not have severe injuries to
the neck and upper vertebra, or obvious marks on his scalp, which
Woodward's lawyers say proved he was not a victim of shaken-baby
syndrome?
</P>
<P>
   The journal article says that when the surface the baby strikes
is soft, like a couch pillow, ``the force of the impact is widely
dissipated and may not be associated with visible signs of surface
trauma, even though the brain itself decelerates rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   As for neck and vertebra damage, ``it's too ill-defined to say
you have to have a neck injury,'' said Dr. Cindy W. Christian, an
author of the journal article and head of the child abuse program
at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ``I don't believe those
things have ever been described as necessary components for this
diagnosis'' of shaken-baby syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Marsha Angell, the New England Journal's editor-in-chief, said
she recruited the authors of the article because they were
independent experts who the journal felt could help shed light on a
subject made even more controversial by the Woodward case.
</P>
<P>
   Such a neutral review was called for in the aftermath of the
trial by Harvey Silverglate, one of Woodward's lawyers. But
Wednesday Silverglate said that what he wanted, and still wants, is
a review not of generic shaken-baby issues like the journal
published, but one where independent scientists examine specific
evidence in the Woodward case, none of which the UPenn researchers
saw.

 UNDATED: With Flowers.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The show also includes works by the Austrian-born Franz
Bischoff, known for delicate floral paintings and vases as well as
landscapes; the Hungarian-born Maurice Braun, who painted the
burnt-sienna canyons of San Diego; John Gamble, a Santa Barbara
resident who captured the intense purple of the lupines that
covered the valleys, and Anna Hills, Joseph Kleitsch, Joseph
Raphael, Arthur Rider, Elmer Wachtel and his wife, the
watercolorist Marion Kavanagh Wachtel. (The exhibition also
includes a smaller showing of California Impressionist paintings
from the collections of Paul and Kathy Bagley and Thomas and
Barbara Stiles, which closes on July 5.)
</P>
<P>
   Six of the artists were National Academy members, and at least
two paintings in the show _ Paul Dougherty's ``Twisted Ledge'' and
Wendt's haunting ``There Is No Solitude'' _ were exhibited at the
academy early this century. ``It's like a homecoming for these
artists, though most people here have never heard of them,'' said
David Dearinger, the academy's chief curator (the show's guest
curator is William Gerdts). Dearinger said that a ``certain East
Coast snobbism'' may have kept California Impressionism from
gaining a popular foothold in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smith agreed. ``Easterners don't think we can do anything
out here in California,'' she said by telephone from her home, in
San Juan Capistrano. ``But the East Coast doesn't have the light,
or the geography.'' Still, she credited one group of Easterners,
the 19th-century Hudson River School, with being the first
environmental painters. ``They painted to protest the Industrial
Revolution and destruction of the land,'' she said, ``just like the
Californians after them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Smith is a daughter of perhaps Orange County's most famous
family (along with their friends, the Richard Nixons). In 1957 she
succeeded her mother, Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke, as a
director of Irvine Co., which was set up to manage and develop the
family's sprawling livestock and produce ranch. For 25 years she
clashed with other directors over the company's future and its
plans to convert the ranch into a city. She pushed for responsible
development of the ranch, insisting on a master plan that included
preservation of natural areas. And she fought to donate 1,000 acres
to build the University of California, Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after a nine-year lawsuit, Mrs. Smith received $257
million for her interests in the company. She used some of that
money to start her Impressionist collection and the Irvine Museum,
which opened in January 1993; she also owns a gallery in Laguna
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Her influence lingers. Last year, Irvine Co. and the Nature
Conservancy joined to preserve 17,000 acres of endangered coastal
sage scrub. ``Some of these paintings might well have been painted
on that land,'' Mrs. Smith said. ``The artists would be very
happy.''

<P>
   ``Godzilla'' has been universally trashed by critics, so there
must be something wrong with me. I liked it.
</P>
<P>
   I consider myself somewhat of a summer movie connoisseur _ I'm
still very fond of that Steven Seagal movie on the submarine, where
Tommy Lee Jones gets a butcher knife stuck in his head _ and
``Godzilla'' is a darn fine summer movie.
</P>
<P>
   It wastes no time on character development or plot coherence.
But it's so obviously goofing on itself that you don't mind. On the
Summer Movie Scale, ``Godzilla'' is much better than ``Twister''
and more fun than ``Independence Day,'' but not as cool as ``Men in
Black.''
</P>
<P>
   And hey, Godzilla can sink a boat 20 times faster than an
iceberg can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' riffs on lots of other movies, besides its
too-obvious similarities to ``Aliens'' and ``Jurassic Park.''
(Let's face it: Godzilla is basically a velociraptor on steroids.)
There are nods to:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Usual Suspects'' (a hospital-bed interview with the sole
survivor of a boat catastrophe);
</P>
<P>
   ``Jaws'' (''We need bigger guns,'' says a soldier after seeing
the big lizard, just as Roy Scheider said, ``We need a bigger
boat,'' after seeing the big shark);
</P>
<P>
   ``Red October'' (an underwater submarine-torpedo chase);
</P>
<P>
   The classic Hitchcock movie ``Foreign Correspondent'' (crowd
scene with black umbrellas);
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Alone'' (can't tell you; would give away too much of the
plot).
</P>
<P>
   ``Godzilla'' has plenty of other inside jokes. The most obvious
is New York Mayor Ebert _ a portly gray-haired guy in glasses _ who
disagrees constantly with his thin, balding assistant, Gene. Even
funnier: Keep an eye out for ``Barney'' playing on a TV set as that
other giant mutated lizard cruises by in the background.
</P>
<P>
   A BAD SEIN: People are complaining that the final ``Seinfeld''
was a letdown. But should we really be surprised that the grand
finale of a show about nothing would be ... nothing special?

U.S. INTERVENES IN CURRENCY MARKETS TO SUPPORT THE YEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also JAPAN-ECON, JAPAN-MARKETPLACE, JAPAN-ECONSCENE) 
(ps) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States on Wednesday took the currency
markets by surprise and bought yen to stop the precipitous fall of
the Japanese currency, a move that President Clinton said he hoped
would stem the worsening Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking briefly in the Rose Garden on Wednesday morning,
Clinton said that he made the decision _ the first action by the
United States to sell dollars and buy yen in a dozen years _ after
speaking by telephone with Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, near midnight on Tuesday. The president said Hashimoto
committed to specific economic changes during the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But the list of actions released by Japan's finance ministry
hours later went only modestly beyond Japan's past agreements to
deregulate the economy, clean up a banking system awash in $600
billion or in bad debts and to change the tax system to stimulate
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a chance to turn that situation in Asia around
before it gets any worse,'' Clinton said. ``America needs a strong,
growing, stable economy in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   While the president defended the American position, some members
of his Cabinet remained skeptical. The decision was hotly debated
inside the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. Secretary of the
Treasury Robert Rubin had tentatively decided not to recommend any
action, but changed his mind only an hour before making a final
recommendation to the president. He and others were swayed by the
last-minute Japanese offers for a few more specific commitments,
and indications that the markets were beginning to turn of their
own accord _ a trend Rubin, a former currency trader himself,
believed he could accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   But the real motivation was a growing sense in Washington and
capitols around Asia that the continued fall of the yen could
ricochet to markets around the world, further destabilizing Russia,
China and Latin America _ and perhaps the United States. ``The
chances were remote,'' Rubin said Wednesday, speaking with his
traditional caution. But he added, ``If a major crisis were to
develop, the effects in our own nation could be great.''
</P>
<P>
   The currency intervention appeared to be in the order of $1.5 to
$2 billion, far less than the $20 billion Japan spent, uselessly,
in April to support its own currency. But the psychological effect
of the American action, with its accompanying suggestion that more
is on the way, was immediate, if perhaps only temporary.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese currency, which touched 146 to the dollar earlier
this week, fell back to about 137. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which had suffered a series of setbacks over the past few
weeks as fears increased that the Asian crisis is entering a new
and more fearsome phase, soared by 164.17 points, closing at
8,829.46.
</P>
<P>
   Still it is far from clear that the joint effort by the Federal
Reserve and the Bank of Japan will offer more than a temporary
respite from what one senior administration official called ``a
massive crisis of confidence among investors in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing and the context suggest a finger in the dike,''
said John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, a view
echoed by many traders who doubted that the yen's recovery could
last in the absence of a major change of course by Japan.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rubin himself told Congress last week that currency
interventions are of limited use unless investors are ``convinced
by the economic fundamentals.'' And that means a series of
unpopular steps to clean up the Japanese economy, including bank
closings, corporate downsizing and big deficit spending by the
government _ all moves that few Japanese politicians want to even
discuss in public before an election for the upper house of
Parliament in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the currency intervention began, President
Clinton sent Rubin's deputy, Lawrence Summers, and William
McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, to Tokyo
for consultations with their Japanese counterparts. Underscoring
the sense that the Asian crisis is worsening fast, the Group of
Seven industrialized nations announced they would hold a meeting of
deputy finance ministers in Tokyo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of President Clinton's trip to China also weighed
heavily on the decision. Over the weekend China accused the United
States and Japan with worsening the Asia crisis by letting the yen
fall, and in a series of messages to Treasury officials in the past
few days, they made began hinting that the pressure was growing to
to devalue China's currency, the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have long feared that such a move would set off
competitive devaluations around the world, as China's competitors
throughout Asia and in Latin America and Central Europe followed
suit so that their own products would not be more expensive than
China's on world markets. That, in turn, could trigger the kind of
market sell-offs, unemployment and social unrest that has built in
Asia since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this proves is that the depths of the Asian crisis are
much, much worse than anticipated,'' C. Fred Bergsten, the
president of the Institute for International Economics, said.
``What spurred this is that many in Asia are talking about their
version of our Great Depression.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the World Bank have also begun to use the phrase
``depression,'' and they told reporters today that they now expect
the Asian economic crisis to last for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect much over the short term,'' said Jonathan L.
Fiechter, the director of the World Bank's financial sector
development department, who has been working on restructuring the
crippled financial systems of South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia.
``It's going to be a long, drawn out process. The risk is a loss of
political support as this drags on. As people lose their jobs, the
consensus for painful change diminishes. ''
</P>
<P>
   Japan, however, has added to the problem immeasurably. Its
economy accounts for 70 percent of all economic activity in Asia.
So its deep recession, which say the economy shrink at an annual
rate of 5.3 percent in the first quarter of this year, has added to
the region's pain in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not buying goods produced in Southeast Asia. The flight
of investors from Japan, including many Japanese who are now free
to put their money in other currencies, has added to the problem,
sending the yen spiraling downward by 15 percent in recent months.
That makes Japanese goods less expensive in the United States and
other countries, pushing out goods produced by other Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
   As the yen dropped day after day, investors began to flee the
currencies of other countries from Russia to Indonesia triggering
new panics in those markets.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Indonesian rupiah, which many expected to
recover after the resignation of President Suharto, has actually
sunk to new lows, roughly 16,000 to the dollar. Before the Asian
economic crisis, it took about 2,400 rupiah to buy a dollar. As a
result, Indonesian banks and businesses that borrowed abroad often
from Japanese banks have stopped paying their debts. That, in turn,
worsens the problems in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has been saying for weeks now that Japan is the biggest
threat to Asia's recovery. But he has resisted calls to intervene
in the markets, declaring that ``ultimately currency markets follow
fundamentals.'' In this case the fundamentals mean a restructuring
of a Japanese economy from top to bottom: closing the weak banks,
dropping tax rates to spur consumer spending, and ending decades of
regulations that were intended to discourage new competitors, both
foreign and domestic, that could disrupt the status quo.

CONVICTED AU PAIR FLIES TO ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT AND PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a departure as dramatic as her arrival in the public
realm Louise Woodward left the United States Wednesday for the
first time since her arrest last year, a squad of police officers
guarding every step as she boarded a first-class flight to England.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day a federal judge temporarily barred Woodward
from spending any profits she might earn by selling her story. The
ruling _ the first step in a civil suit against Woodward, convicted
of killing 8-month-old Matthew Eappen _ signaled the continuation
of a legal epic that is scheduled to last at least through the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   But Woodward, 20, was legally free to leave. Her criminal case
complete, a $4,301 one-way plane ticket in hand, Woodward walked
from her temporary home in Marblehead and said goodbye to her
criminal attorneys for the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is relieved and pleased to be going home,'' said her
former attorney Andrew Good, as Woodward disappeared into a
first-class lounge inside the British Airways terminal at Logan
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The departure marked the end of several days of chaos for both
Woodward and her former employers, Deborah and Sunil Eappen.
</P>
<P>
   Four months after both sides appealed Woodward's murder
conviction, the state's highest court on Tuesday upheld Judge
Hiller B. Zobel's decision to reduce Woodward's second-degree
murder conviction to manslaughter and free her after 279 days in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by the Supreme Judicial Court, however, sharply
criticized Zobel for several key moves _ including his decision at
trial to remove manslaughter from among the jury's options. A
dissenting opinion also lambasted Zobel for appearing too
sympathetic toward the former au pair and imposing a lenient
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   But the SJC opinion let Woodward's criminal conviction stand
without ordering a new sentence. It also allowed her to leave
Massachusetts, where she had remained involuntarily during the
appeals process at the demand of the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was getting ready to go to college when this happened,''
said Harvey Silverglate, another former member of the Woodward
defense team. ``She very much wants to return home.''
</P>
<P>
   The SJC ruling had another important effect: it prompted the
Eappen family to file a civil suit they had prepared in advance
against Woodward in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens _ who supported Middlesex County prosecutors'
decision to appeal the verdict and who urged the court to return
their former babysitter to prison for the murder of their youngest
son _ filed the suit just 78 minutes after the SJC decision was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; They want $75,000 in compensatory damages _ the minimum
required for a civil case filed in federal court _ as well as
unspecified punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also seeks to bar Woodward from ever enjoying profits
she could earn by selling her story of the murder trial. A trial
date inthe civil case has been set for Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in Wednesday's hearing in federal court was an
immediate ban on Woodward's ability to sell her story in the United
States and spend the profits. &UR;  &LR; Judge William G. Young granted the
request, imposing a temporary, 12-day ban that also requires
Woodward to notify the court if she sells her story.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he'll revisit the issue June 29 after he studies a
1995 SJC ruling in the case of Katherine A. Power, a fugitive who
admitted she participated in a bank robbery in September 1970 that
left a Boston police officer dead.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the court ruled, a judge properly banned Power
from selling the story of her crime for profit. The judge made the
ban against Power a condition of her probation.
</P>
<P>
   Young's temporary ban, which lawyers for the Eappens say they
are already seeking to extend, won't block Woodward from writing a
book or selling movie rights; it simply forbids her from spending
the profits. The Eappens say that money should be kept in escrow
should they win their civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward ``doesn't have a constitutional right to get any money
from that,'' said an attorney for the Eappens, Frederic L. Ellis.
``It would be kind of like O.J. Simpson saying, `I'm going to write
a book and make $10 million, and I'm not going to give any of that
to the Goldmans.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens have already established a foundation to prevent
child abuse in their son's name. They say any judgment against
Woodward will be deposited there, their lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling Wednesday, Judge Young said he believed there was
a ``reasonable likelihood'' that the Eappens can win their first
claim in the civil lawsuit _ that Woodward caused Matthew's death
through ``willful, wanton or reckless conduct.'' Her manslaughter
conviction can be used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   One of Woodward's attorneys, Anthony Doniger, argued that the
order unfairly infringed on Woodward's free speech rights, since
the attorneys for the Eappens have targeted money she might make by
telling her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not seeking to restrain her other assets,'' he said.
``Instead, they're chilling her First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at least, Woodward showed little interest in
exercising her freedom of speech.
</P>
<P>
   After slipping from the house in Marblehead where she has lived
since late March, Woodward was whisked to the airport in a red
minivan with tinted windows. Police escorts, lights flashing, both
led and trailed her car. A news helicopter hovered overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At Logan, Woodward emerged from the van, her hair down, dressed
in a black pants suit. She kept her eyes trained straight ahead and
ignored questions shouted by reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by seven state troopers, Woodward then swept past
throngs of economy-class passengers waiting in line and heading
straight to the British Airways first-class lounge, complete with a
mini bar. She waited there until boarding her 5:30 p.m. flight.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's one-way ticket was for a first-class seat equipped
with eight movie channels and a VCR, airport officials said. The
special section, sealed off from all but 13 other passengers, also
shielded her from the press.
</P>
<P>
   Under a federal law that prohibits foreigners convicted of
felonies from living in or returning to the United States, Woodward
would have to apply to the government if she wanted to board a
flight back to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although the US Immigration and Naturalization Service has not
yet determined whether Woodward would fall under the ban,
immigration experts said it would be highly unusual for a
manslaughter convict to be allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``The elements of her conviction would be reviewed to see if
it was a crime of violence and if she should be admitted to the
country,'' said William Strassberger, an INS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Woodward would want to return to the United States,
where she &UR;  &LR; has by turns been a prisoner, a celebrity and a
lightning rod for public opinion, remained in doubt. She did not,
according to her attorney, ``know what the future will hold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's only 20,'' Good said. ``This won't last forever as an
issue in her life. She'll outlive it.''

CALIFORNIA REGENT TO EXAMINE ETHNIC STUDIES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By FRANK BRUNI     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The University of California regent who led the
effort to eliminate affirmative action at the state's public
universities expressed serious qualms Wednesday about ethnic
studies programs and suggested that he might try to curtail them.
</P>
<P>
   The regent, Ward Connerly, said that in the next two months he
would review the programs to verify his suspicion that they in
effect promoted ``self-imposed segregation'' on California's
campuses and existed in part to coddle members of minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly, who is black, declined to speculate about what would
happen after his review. But his questions about ethnic studies
seemed certain to stoke the outrage of many faculty members and
students angry about declines this year in admissions of black and
Hispanic students to the University of California's most selective
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly's remarks also illustrated the degree to which many
liberal programs in education, from racial preferences to bilingual
teaching, are coming under fresh scrutiny in California.
</P>
<P>
   Several faculty members at the University of California at
Berkeley said Wednesday that Connerly's review of ethnic studies
represented the latest, but probably not the last, assault on
diversity both at and beyond the state's universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a time when the state has come to believe that
immigrants _ particularly Chicanos _ and African-Americans
represent some drain on the body politic,'' William Banks, a
professor in the African-American Studies department at Berkeley,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Referring specifically to Connerly's challenge of ethnic
studies, Banks added: ``He has concluded that people are happy with
the drop in ethnic enrollments and, hey, while the animal's
bleeding, let's put another stake in its leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Connerly said he was concerned that ethnic studies served as a
divisive force, catering to the members of a given ethnic group and
stressing that group's differences from the rest of society. He
also questioned whether the purpose of the classes was truly
academic, or whether they were exercises in racial and ethnic
pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this something people can learn from their parents, at
home, without the taxpayers paying for it?'' Connerly asked in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know whether they have academic value or whether
they were created largely because of political pressures that came
about in the 1970s and 1980s, when black nationalism was taking
hold,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly was a leader two years ago in the successful campaign
for the statewide initiative that banned affirmative action in
public employment and university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   He first expressed his reservations about ethnic studies, which
include African-American, Hispanic, Asian-American and
Native-American programs, in an interview on Tuesday with the
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday he did not immediately plan to share his
concerns formally with the other members of the Board of Regents,
which sets policy for the University of California system. But he
said that if his investigation confirmed his qualms and he could
not get faculty members to change the programs on their own, he
would involve the other regents.
</P>
<P>
   Connerly also said that he wanted the regents to investigate the
use of university funds for special racial or ethnic graduation
ceremonies at University of California campuses. Connerly said he
opposed this practice and would ask the regents to discuss it when
they meet on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these things, I believe, Balkanize my state,'' Connerly
said.
</P>
<P>
   But several professors said that courses offered under the
banner of ethnic studies were no more or less exclusionary or
political than courses in, say, French or Jewish history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are only black studies divisive?'' Troy Duster, a black
professor of sociology at Berkeley, asked. ``That's distorted
political logic.'' &QL;

JAPANESE POP STAR'S SUICIDE: END OF A LIFE, END OF AN ERA

   (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code)

<P>
   TOKYO _ ``And jumping into the No. 1 spot this week,'' announced
Hiroshi Morita from the studios of NHK radio here last week, ``is
`Pink Spider' by Hide. As you may already know, Hide is the former
guitarist of the group X Japan who shocked his fans by committing
suicide recently.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio began to buzz with murmuring. ``His record company
says it was an accident,'' said one engineer, as those around him
laughed. ``The label also says it's sticking with Hide's original
release plan,'' said another. There was more laughter.
</P>
<P>
   At newsstands, Hide's face graces the cover of almost every
music magazine; in shopping districts, outfits like his sell for
several hundred dollars; on television, his videos are repeated as
often as commercials, and in record stores his singles are
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Below ``Pink Spider'' in the Japanese Top 10 was a previous Hide
single, ``Rocket Dive,'' and this week ``Pink Spider'' was knocked
out of the No. 1 slot by another single, ``Stay Free,'' also by
Hide.
</P>
<P>
   In just a few weeks, pop culture in Japan had gone from mourning
Hide's death to consuming it.
</P>
<P>
   Hide (pronounced Hee-DAY) was the intensely charismatic
guitarist in X Japan, one of the country's first and most
successful independent-label rock acts (though the band later
signed with a major label) and the first Japanese rock band to sell
out the 50,000-seat Tokyo Dome. Since it formed in the mid-1980s, X
Japan went from playing loud, fast thrash-metal to stadium-shaking
pop ballads, in the process pioneering its own genre, a Japanese
equivalent of glam rock known as ``visual kei.''
</P>
<P>
   For visual kei bands, outrageous, usually androgynous looks _
gobs of makeup, hair dyed and sprayed in ways that made Mohawks
look conservative, and a small fortune spent on leather and jewelry
_ were as important as music (or, in many cases after X, more
important than music). When X members followed in the steps of
American hard-rock bands like Metallica and cut their hair in the
'90s, thousands of Japanese girls wept openly in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   X actually signed with Atlantic Records in the United States,
but the band never released an album at home. It broke up late last
year, and Hide began to emerge from the shadow of the band's most
popular member, the drummer Yoshiki (who released a classical album
with the Beatles' producer George Martin and the London
Philharmonic Orchestra).
</P>
<P>
   With a blossoming solo career, everything seemed to be going
well for Hide until May 2, when he was found dead in his apartment,
a towel looped around his neck and tied to the bathroom doorknob.
Within a week, five teen-age Japanese girls had tried to kill
themselves while playing X music or wearing X merchandise. Three
succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   At his funeral, 50,000 young fans mobbed the streets. By the
day's end, some 60 of them were taken to hospitals, and nearly 200
received medical treatment in first-aid tents after passing out or
injuring themselves. (One girl tried to slit her wrists with a
plastic knife.) ``Please do not follow him,'' urged the surviving
members of X. ``Do not commit suicide. Send him off to heaven
warmly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Burton-Lewis, a radio- and video-show host who toured with
Hide as a disk jockey, said the funeral was the most crowded ever
for a postwar Japanese musician, which was surprising considering
that hardly anyone over 30 knew who he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wake was sad,'' he remembered. ``I was sitting in there
for two hours, and all you heard outside was kids screaming from
the bottom of their stomachs. They sounded like demons. In Japan,
the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going
through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans:
they dress like it, they breathe it, they all talk about how he
gave them something to live for.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what Hide did was grotesque. He's talked about
suicide in his records for five years. But the fans who followed
him always knew there was a Hide behind that who was a very solid
character. He was very outspoken about freedom and doing what you
want, and he took on a fan who had a rare bone marrow disease as a
personal crusade.''
</P>
<P>
   While the authorities decided that Hide killed himself, his
friends and former band members said they felt certain it was not
suicide, despite the dark lyrics of some X and Hide songs. Most
remembered Hide as a character who would go out of control when he
was drunk, often getting himself into some sort of trouble and then
claiming not to remember a thing the next day. His death in this
strange circumstance, they said, was a drunken accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him a few days before he passed away, and I had no
indication from him that anything was wrong other than that he was
exhausted,'' said Paul Raven, an English musician who played bass
in Killing Joke and Prong. Raven recently formed an industrial
hard-rock band with Hide called Zilch. Its debut album will be
released in Japan on July 23 and features former members of Nine
Inch Nails and the Cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was under a lot of pressure to finish his solo record,''
Raven continued. ``He had three songs completed the day before he
died, and now mysteriously a full album is coming out nine days
before ours.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Hide was reminiscent of Kurt Cobain of Nirvana,
although Hide had a less bleak world view. Hide, like Cobain, said
he felt like a marginal alternative-minded figure trapped in the
image of a pop star. He despised the music business and wanted to
change it; he represented a generation of fans who felt alienated,
and his death represented the end of a genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, Hide's death means the end of an era,''
said Steve McClure, Tokyo bureau chief for Billboard, the
music-industry magazine. ``X were the first generation of visual
kei bands, but the novelty has worn off. For the next generation of
bands, it's like: `That's it. The torch has been passed to us.'''

ECONOMIC SCENE: REMEDY FOR JAPAN'S ECONOMY IS INFLATION
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Japan slipping into recession and the yen sagging to an
eight-year low, the Clinton administration has finally intervened
to prop up the Japanese currency. No one is saying that the
intervention is more than a palliative. One way or another Japan
must jump-start its long-sputtering economy.
</P>
<P>
   But how? Traditional monetary policy plainly hasn't worked.
Creditworthy Japanese companies can already borrow at a
ridiculously low 1 percent interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   And fiscal policy hasn't done much better. While the stimulus
packages of the last few years have made a difference, consumers
have refused to keep buying after the spigot has been shut off.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman, an economist at MIT, argues that the time has come
for Japan to inflate its way out of the problem. He concedes that
asking the Bank of Japan to ``credibly promise to be
irresponsible'' smacks of desperation, but adds that desperate
measures may be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Japan, a pro-inflation stance is no longer unthinkable.
While Japan has been deeply conservative on financial matters, Gary
Saxonhouse, an economist at the University of Michigan, notes that
its newly independent central bank is not averse to radical
thinking. ``At least one widely respected member of their
equivalent of the Fed's Open Market Committee has publicly
supported reflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese economy is barely bigger than it was in 1990. Its
long period of stagnation has brought myriad problems to the
surface _ notably that most banks would be insolvent if their
holdings of stocks and real estate were valued at market prices.
Given the failure of both easy monetary policy and fiscal stimulus
to make a lasting difference in the economy, conventional wisdom
points to free-market reforms as the key to Japan's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Few dispute the potential payoff. But, at best, progress will be
slow: cleaning up the clubby banking system, for example, would
take years _ even if the political establishment allowed insolvent
ones to close their doors. And Krugman, who made a splash a few
years ago by comparing Asia's economic miracle to the mixed
blessings of Soviet industrialization, wonders if it is really
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   By his analysis, Japan is caught in a Keynesian ``liquidity
trap,'' not very different from the one that bedeviled America in
the early 1930s. Aging Japanese households are inclined to save
their money. And with the price of everything from washing machines
to office towers falling, earning 1/2 percent interest on savings
accounts still looks like a better route to wealth than buying
housing or autos.
</P>
<P>
   The way out is to convince ordinary Japanese that inflation is
on the horizon, driving them out of cash and into new Toyotas. To
manage this, Krugman wants the central bank to assert that it will
pump whatever amount of money is necessary to generate inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The standard approach under modern monetary policy would be to
increase banks' reserves, and hence the amount they can lend, by
buying government bonds with cash. But nobody in Japan wants to
borrow in the current deflationary climate. ``You can't make a
liquidity trap go away by throwing in more money,'' argued William
Dudley, the chief U.S. economist at Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   What might work, suggests Dudley, is a hybrid of fiscal and
monetary stimulus _ say, a big temporary tax cut, plus a firm
commitment by the Bank of Japan to keep interest rates near zero
even as prices rose. With expectations turned from deflation to
inflation, households would have a new reason to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, says Albert Fishlow, an economist at the Council on
Foreign Relations, is that Japanese households have another way to
protect their assets against inflation. Thanks, ironically, to
pressure from Washington to open their capital markets, the
Japanese are now free to buy dollars or marks. So one plausible
consequence of a shift to expectations of inflation would be a rush
to foreign investments, which would weaken the yen still more.
</P>
<P>
   A weaker yen would make Japan's goods even more competitive in
world markets than they are now _ not necessarily a bad result for
Japan, which has always used export growth to end recessions. But
it would trigger protectionist sentiment in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, it would make goods from China, Indonesia,
Thailand and Indonesia less competitive in the huge Japanese
market, perhaps leading to another round of currency depreciation.
Indeed, much of the global anxiety over the recent fall of the yen
is about its impact on the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   So even if desperate measures work for Japan, they might
backfire for its ailing Asian trade partners. If only as a matter
of prudence, then, counsels Fishlow, ``we ought to be focusing on
how the rest of Asia can make an economic comeback without help
from Japan.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday jettisoned broad
legislation intended to curb smoking by teen-agers, the most
ambitious and contentious measure before Congress, and left almost
no hope it could be revived this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would have raised the price of cigarettes by
$1.10 a pack, had been debated on the Senate floor for a month. It
was set aside when supporters, mostly Democrats, could not get the
60 votes needed to clear two procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats promised to bring the matter up again at every
opportunity this year, but they conceded that they had little
chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the final vote on this bill occurs on election
day,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents of the bill argued that after senators
approved amendments that cut taxes and added anti-drug provisions,
it was not primarily an anti-smoking measure but a tax-and-spend
bill. ``This is a massive tax on low-income Americans, and it is
used to proliferate the bureaucracy of this government,'' declared
Sen. John Ashcroft of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain, the maverick Republican from Arizona who
was the bill's chief sponsor, had a different view. ``This bill is
not about taxes,'' he told the Senate just before the votes. ``It's
about whether we're going to allow the death march of 418,000
Americans a year who die early from tobacco-related disease and do
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton decried the Senate vote and promised to
continue fighting for passage of comprehensive tobacco legislation.
And he made it clear that he would use the rejection for partisan
purposes in the autumn congressional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, I am very disappointed that a Republican
minority blocked the legislation from being voted on,'' Clinton
said in an impromptu appearance in the White House briefing room on
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been working for three years now to protect our
children from the dangers of tobacco,'' he added. ``I want the
tobacco lobby and its allies on Capitol Hill to know that from my
point of view, this battle is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said the
Senate was so dividedon the tobacco issue that it is impossible to
produce a bill that would command the 60 votes needed to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't figure out a way to get a bill that would be
credible,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   On the crucial vote, 57 senators voted to cut off debate and
move to a final vote, a procedure called cloture. But that was
three votes shy of the 60 votes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three Democrats and 14 Republicans voted in favor of
cloture. Forty Republicans and two Democrats from tobacco states,
Wendell Ford of Kentucky and Charles Robb of Virginia, voted
against cloture.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Senate dealt the final blow by voting to send the bill
back to the Commerce Committee so that violations of budget rules
could be repaired. It would have required 60 votes to prevent this
from happening, and the supporters fell seven votes short.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have been
waiting to see what happened in the Senate before they moved on a
tobacco bill. They are opposed to ambitious legislation like the
Senate bill. However, the feeling in the House on Wednesday night
was that the leaders might still try to pass a less comprehensive
alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising the price of cigarettes over the next
five years, the Senate measure would have given the government new
authority to regulate tobacco advertising and marketing and imposed
stiff penalties on cigarette makers if the rate of teen-age smoking
did not fall to specified levels.
</P>
<P>
   But amendments added in the Senate in the last few weeks would
have given a tax break to married couples and established new
programs against drug abuse. These measures will die with the
overall bill, though they might be added to other legislation
before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was prompted to consider the tobacco bill by the
settlement signed a year ago this Saturday by the major tobacco
companies and the attorneys general from 40 states. Under the
agreement, the industry would have paid $368.5 billion over the
next 25 years and agreed to restraints on tobacco advertising. In
return, they would have been given immunity from most lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement required congressional action before it could go
into effect. Without a federal law, the states are expected to
press their multibillion-dollar legal claims against the tobacco
companies. Many individuals may also go to court now, especially in
light of the decision of a jury in Florida last week to find the
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. liable for a smoker's death.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill came out of McCain's committee in April on a
19-to-1 bipartisan vote, its prospects for approval seemed good.
But the tobacco companies rebelled and began a national advertising
campaign against the bill said to cost tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters said that these ads turned the tide, much
as ads by insurance companies were held responsible for defeating
President Clinton's health-care plan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies have made a very wise investment, and
they have won,'' McCain said.

STOCKS SOAR AFTER U.S. AND JAPAN AID YEN
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market staged a powerful rally Wednesday
after the United States and Japan bought yen to bolster the sagging
currency, whose fall has threatened to plunge Asia into a deeper
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that financial instability in Japan and Southeast Asia
would result in a global slowdown this year that would cut even
deeper into the already slumping profits of American companies had
punished share prices for the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But investors stampeded back into the market after the U.S.
government and the Bank of Japan moved to bolster the value of the
Japanese yen, partly in the hope of preventing a deeper economic
and currency crisis in Japan and the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging more than 207 points, or 2.3 percent, Monday on
fears of a widening crisis in Asia, enthusiastic buying sent the
Dow Jones industrial average soaring 164.17 points, or 1.89
percent, to close at 8,829.46.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of companies that had been battered by a huge wave of
selloffs recently roared back to life in one of the heaviest
trading days of the year with more than 744 million shares changing
hands. While a wide majority of stocks gained, technology and
blue-chip issues led the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market had been going down because of Japan _ Japan was
the new wrinkle in Southeast Asia,'' said Byron Wien, the U.S.
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``But now it
looks like there's intervention and that Japan's going to deal with
its problems, and that is a clear positive for the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government's decision to buy Japanese yen with
dollars, coupled with promises that Japanese officials would
address the deepening banking crisis there, helped lift the value
of the Japanese currency, which had fallen close to an eight-year
low on Monday at 146.15 yen to the dollar. Wednesday, the value of
the yen reached 136.37.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices, however, plummeted after rising sharply in the last
week on the prospect that Asia's economic slowdown would benefit
bondholders by dragging down commodity prices and helping stave off
inflationary pressure. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury,
which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.73
Wednesday from 5.65 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, though, Wednesday's events were not a clear
indication that corporate profits, which are expected to be hurt in
the coming year by a strong dollar and falling demand in Asia, are
no longer in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asia problem is clearly not going to go away easily,''
said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
``Investors would like to believe it's going to go away, but it's
already clearly had an impact on earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the last few weeks several large multinational
companies, including IBM, 3M and Motorola, have warned that the
Asian economic crisis would depress earnings growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy continues to grow at a robust pace, with
few signs of inflation, slowing profit growth in the first quarter
of the year and worries that Asia's festering crisis would pinch
profits even more led to a sharp selloff beginning in mid-April,
after the Dow peaked at 9,211.84.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, investors helped ignite the Dow, which soared as
much as 230 points before a late wave of selling pushed the index
lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 19.52, or 1.79
percent, to 1,107.11, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.33 percent,
to 1,776.40.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks gained after the price of oil soared on reports that
the leaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would move to establish more oil production cuts. And, tobacco
stocks, which rose modestly Wednesday, may rise higher Thursday
because the Senate voted to reject a tobacco bill aimed at curbing
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   To prolong the rally, however, analysts say that Japanese
officials are going to have to do much more than commit to banking
reform and stimulus packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially a watershed event for the financial
crisis,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, the chief investment strategist
at Lehman Brothers. ``However, the real economy in Japan is still
going down. But what was crucial for the markets was to see a
policy response. And that's what you're seeing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wien of Morgan Stanley added that a big selloff may yet come
later this year if things don't change, at home and in Asia. The
rally, he said, was simply an indication that things were looking
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rally on the promise Japan will do something,'' he
said. ``So we'll have to see what Japan does, and then assess
whether it's enough.'' &QL;

   ``Holy Writings, Sacred Text''
</P>
<P>
   By John Barton
</P>
<P>
   Westminster John Knox Press, $18
</P>
<P>
   The Bible, as some have pointed out, did not fall from a clear
blue sky in a black leather binding and King James English. John
Barton's argument is that even the more scholarly views of why the
Bible includes what it does, and not something else, bear
re-examination.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional view is that various Christian writings
gradually emerged and were accorded authority, and then lines were
drawn: Revelation is in, and the Epistle of Barnabas is not. But
the Oxford University professor argues that what could be called
the core New Testament becomes obvious, and obviously important,
almost immediately _ but how the Christians (and Jews) of ancient
times understood the ideas of ``Scripture'' and ``canon,'' and how
they used the writings in those categories, are different questions
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Barton's views are clearly left of center, although he
says that his conclusions ``do not seem to me to serve either a
conservative or a liberal agenda. ... I nowhere say how Scripture
should be regarded; only how it was in fact regarded at various
points in the past.'' Still, ``Holy Writings, Sacred Text''
contains some fascinating ideas for those interested in a scholarly
study of the topic. _ Alan Cochrum

ADVERTISING: RESHAPING PERCEPTIONS OF ADVERTISING
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Advertising Federation is undertaking what is
intended to be a major multiyear communications initiative to
promote and demonstrate the importance of advertising to marketers
and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the initiative are to be outlined at the federation's
1998 American Advertising Conference in Minneapolis, which begins
Thursday and continues through Sunday. Plans call for the program,
known as ``Advertising: A New Brand of Business,'' to be introduced
in phases; steps would include a survey assessing attitudes about
advertising, a campaign aimed at corporate executives and even a
speakers' bureau to place advertising topics on the agendas of
business conferences.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative comes as agencies are fighting efforts by
management consulting companies to usurp their functions by
offering advertisers brand and marketing strategy services. The
consultants have met with some success in part because they are
perceived as providing more strategic, ``big picture'' advice than
agencies do.
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts to pitch advertising have been concentrated on
such issues as the value of building brands or sustained spending
on campaigns. This time, however, the federation _ which represents
marketers, agencies and media companies _ wants to focus on
reshaping perceptions about advertising.
</P>
<P>
   If as the old slogan goes, orange juice isn't just for breakfast
anymore, the federation will proclaim that advertising isn't just
clever commercials, amusing animated spokescharacters and punchy
promotions. Rather, the initiative is intended to present
advertising as a fundamental strategic discipline _ echoing what
the management consultants assert _ and agencies as the
professionals that are most expert in that field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've let advertising become too narrowly defined as only the
output,'' said Wally Snyder, president and chief executive of the
federation. ``There's nothing wrong with that, but as a result
we're now viewed by some clients as vendors when we're more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder, who is based in Washington, offered a preview of the
initiative in an interview last week during a visit to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thrust will be to redefine advertising in the minds of
clients at the highest levels,'' Snyder said. ``Our goal is for
them to see advertising as a discipline that is underpinned with
strategic capabilities and broader in terms of the communications
tools at its disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we want to let them know that we have an understanding of
the consumer,'' he added, ``and can connect them with consumers in
the most favorable communications environments'' _ particularly in
media like the Internet that enable marketers to better direct
sales messages at specific consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   The federation is forming a steering committee to oversee the
initiative. There will be 27 members, drawn from the ranks of
advertisers, agencies and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Among those members are: Wilder Baker, chairman and chief
executive at Warwick Baker O'Neill; Myer Berlow, senior vice
president for interactive marketing at AOL Networks, a unit of
America Online; Samuel Chisholm, president and chief executive at
Chisholm-Mingo Group; Robert Lachky, vice president for brand
management at Anheuser-Busch Inc.; Arthur Liebler, vice president
for marketing at Chrysler Corp., and David Steward, president and
chief executive at TV Guide magazine, which News Corp. is selling
to United Video Satellite Guide.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the committee will be one of the heaviest
hitters in clientdom: Philip Guarascio, vice president and general
manager for marketing and advertising at the North American
operations of General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In remarks prepared for delivery at the conference, Guarascio
declared, ``We _ the whole advertising profession _ are guilty of
neglecting ourselves and of letting advertising's `brand image' and
identity deteriorate.'' He added, ``And now we are reaping what
we've been sowing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to do, always and unceasingly, is dramatize to
our target audience the value of advertising,'' Guarascio
continued. ``Why should there be any doubt about the power of
advertising to build brands and deliver a return on investment? And
yet there is doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why, Guarascio said, the federation needs its members to
help ``build the new, redefined brand of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial step will be the survey to gauge attitudes about
advertising, which the research firm of Erdos &AMP; Morgan will conduct
among corporate leaders. Results are to be presented in November.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Snyder said, the steering committee will begin work
on the ad campaign, which will be directed at ``chief executives,
chief financial officers, board members and other `influencers'''
who help determine corporate behavior. The timetable calls for the
campaign to be introduced in 1999, perhaps at the federation's next
American Advertising Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if federation member agencies would be preferred in a
review to select a shop to create the campaign, Snyder smiled and
replied, ``We have a lot of options with our members.''

`PARTY MONSTER': THE LIFE OF THE PARTY TURNS DEADLY AND COLD

<P>
   Fifteen minutes of fame? Michael Alig's were followed by 10 to
20 years in prison. His is a morality tale for this complicated
age: the details are luridly clear, but the moral is what you make
it.
</P>
<P>
   Alig was the magnetic, flamboyant leader of the cadre of
Manhattan ``club kids'' who flocked to the drug-basted bacchanals
he organized at clubs like the Limelight. By the time the Limelight
was padlocked by federal drug agents in 1995, his bizarre world was
unraveling. Then it blew apart. Last year, at 31, he was convicted
of manslaughter for the brutal death of one of his troupe, a man
known as Angel who was Alig's sometime roommate and drug supplier.
</P>
<P>
   This story is vividly told in ``Party Monster,'' an hourlong
documentary by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato to be shown Thursday
night at midnight as part of the ``Cinemax Reel Life'' series.
</P>
<P>
   Video verite is the ideal medium for Alig. Much of his
Roman-candle existence was already on tape. He and his hundreds of
anonymously intimate friends strutted for the camera nightly. They
shed clothes, consumed drugs and gleefully submitted to arrest;
it's all shown here, skillfully alternated with later interviews.
(The directors' only serious misstep was including a few
blue-tinted re-enactment scenes that undermine the project's
authenticity.)
</P>
<P>
   Here are former club kids still in awe of what they saw and did.
Here is Alig's mother, who seems sad but only because the joy ride
is over. And here is Alig himself. He has traded his downtown duds
for a Rikers Island prison jumpsuit, but he also wears the
mischievous grin of a boy who has gotten away with ... what?
Murder? No, he says with a giggle: he had to plead to manslaughter;
if they get you for murder, you don't get a VCR in prison.
</P>
<P>
   As a teen-ager in South Bend, Ind., Alig knew he was different
(being gay was just part of it) and delighted in watching the
bloodiest horror films. He came to New York City, found the night
life and quickly dropped out of college to work as a party
promoter. A platoon of young people were drawn to his tainted
effervescence. In exchange for drinks and drugs, they dressed up in
high-heeled drag or a bright-yellow chicken suit to help keep the
customers satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The media doted on Alig, who was dependably outrageous on cue. A
young woman named Glitsie recalls seeing him on ``Geraldo'' when
she was 12. ``I thought, `My gosh, that's what I want to do,''' she
says, still wide-eyed. Another recruit was Andre Melendez, the
Angel who strutted at the soirees in a black biker's cap and
feathered wings.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the parties pulsating, Alig began reaching back to his
beloved horror movies, reveling in fake violence and blood. But
life and fantasy became tragically enmeshed. After Melendez was
killed in a fight over debts and heroin, Alig and a friend hacked
up the body and threw it into the Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Alig fled with Glitsie, who stuck by him when he was racked by
drugs or the lack of them. But when part of Angel's body washed up
on a Staten Island beach, the accomplice confessed. The party was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have scary dreams about Angel,'' says Alig, who appears
serenely comfortable with himself. ``But nothing I can do will
bring him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Glitsie never lost her childlike devotion to Alig, which
probably saved his life. But not hers. In January, she died of a
drug overdose.

STUDY DETAILS THREAT TO ATHLETES FROM HEART BLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six-year-old Jacob Watt, an Illinois Little Leaguer, became the
latest victim on June 6. Matthew Messing, a 16-year-old hockey
player from Massachusetts died from it in 1995. St. Louis Blues
hockey captain Chris Pronger last month was a near-miss.
</P>
<P>
   Now Boston researchers have nailed down the cause of commotio
cordis, a medical term that means ``concussion of the heart.'' They
also showed that preventive measures, such as softer baseballs for
younger players, do work.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published Thursday, Dr. Mark S. Link of New England
Medical Center and his colleagues demonstrated in anesthetized pigs
that a blow to the chest of only moderate force can stop the heart
cold if it occurs within a tiny window of time _ 15/1,000ths of a
second _ when the heart is suspended between beats, recharging
itself to prepare for the next beat.
</P>
<P>
   The entire cycle of a heartbeat lasts only about one second when
the heart rate is 60 beats per minute. The vulnerable period, Link
noted, only lasts about 1/100th of the entire cycle.
</P>
<P>
   The research resolved a mystery about the cause of death from
commotio cordis. It does not result from physical damage to the
heart, rupture of the muscle, or bleeding, which is why it has been
impossible to document in autopsies. It is caused by disruption of
electrical activity in the heart muscle during the instant before
the tissue is fully recharged and ready to contract again.
</P>
<P>
   Commotio cordis is almost invariably fatal. ``There are six
recorded cases of survival of commotio cordis over the last 10
years,'' Link said. ``Before that, people didn't recognize this as
an entity. And even now it's not that well recognized, so we don't
know how often it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Dr. Barry J. Maron of Minneapolis Heart
Institute, a collaborator in the new study, has counted 70 cases of
commotio cordis in this country _ 45 of them in the three years
since he published an article in the New England Journal of
Medicine bringing the phenomenon to wider attention. The same
journal published the new study in its current edition.
</P>
<P>
   Commotio cordis almost always involves children and adolescents
under age 17, when the chest wall is thinner and more pliable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be this is more common than we think,'' Link said.
``These are often not reported on.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by the US Product Safety Commission counted 168,000
emergency room visits due to baseball-related injuries in 1996. Of
those, 68 involved deaths, and 38 were caused by baseball blows to
the chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests that commotio cordis is the most common cause of
deaths in baseball,'' said Link, whose five-year-old son and
seven-year-old daughter play Little League. ``But it's still
uncommon, and certainly it's no reason not to play baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger's rare luck in surviving the disorder may have stemmed
from a blow that occurred just slightly outside the 15- millisecond
time frame, Link said, judging from the two animals out of 66 in
the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   If a blow occurs at a different point in the cycle, the
reesarchers found, it can cause a temporary condition called
``complete heart block,'' which is not fatal but can cause a
drastically slowed heart rate and fainting.
</P>
<P>
   In the pig experiments, the team showed that softer ``safety
balls,'' developed to minimize head trauma among Little Leaguers,
sharply reduced the risk of commotio cordis, even when the animals
received the blow during the vulnerable time frame.
</P>
<P>
   Using the softest safety balls, designed for children under age
eight, only two of 26 pigs suffered commotio cordis after being
struck during the vulnerable time window. A regulation baseball
caused the heart to stop eight out of 23 times.
</P>
<P>
   Safety balls of two intermediate degrees of softness, marketed
for children between ages eight and 10 or 11 to 13, seemed somewhat
safer than regulation balls, but the differences were not
statistically significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another approach to prevention is the use of chest
protectors,'' said Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a New England Journal
editor, in an editorial accompanying the new study. ``The shoulder
pads worn by hockey and lacrosse players are inadequate to protect
the chest, particularly when the arms are raised, and baseball
players generally wear no chest protectors at all while batting.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that the journal rarely publishes animal studies, Curfman
said the article's value ``will be to raise awareness about
commodio cordis, demystify its cause, and educate us about the
recognition and prevention of this tragic phenomenon.''

CHINESE SUDDENLY IMPROVED ROCKET LAUNCHES, EXPERT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Mo., Calif.)   (bl)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A simple, one-page chart presented Wednesday
captured the essence of Congress' inquiry into whether sensitive
U.S. space technology was illicitly slipped to Chinese rocket
scientists.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The chart, offered at a House hearing by Henry Sokolski, who was
the Pentagon's top expert monitoring proliferation during the Bush
administration, showed that between 1990 and 1996, one in four
Chinese rockets carrying commercial satellites blew up. But since
1996, the Chinese have had a perfect record: 10 consecutive
successful launches.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No failures in the past 10 launches,'' Sokolski mulled aloud.
``Is that a coincidence or is it the result of cumulative
technology transfers?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and witnesses voiced diverse opinions in response to
Sokolski's rhetorical question, but offered no definitive answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the timing of China's new-found success in launching
multimillion-dollar satellites into orbit was striking. It was in
mid-1996 that two U.S. satellite makers _ Loral Space &AMP;
Communications and Hughes Electronics _ helped Chinese engineers
figure out why a satellite launching failed in February 1996. The
Justice Department is conducting a criminal inquiry to determine
whether the two companies breached U.S. national security. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reliability of Chinese rockets is important because the
missiles that send U.S. communications satellites into orbit are
very similar to the Chinese missiles that carry nuclear warheads.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rare joint hearing of two committees, International Relations
and National Security, Wednesday opened the House's inquiry into
this issue as well as into whether the Clinton administration's
shift of satellite-licensing authority in 1996 to the Commerce
Department from the State Department loosened controls over
sensitive technology.  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Partisan overtones hung over the hearing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's track record in this regard displays a
single-minded determination to evade sanctions and to ignore or
downplay national security concerns in the interest of exporting
sensitive U.S. technology in the name of `engagement' with China,''
said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., who heads the National Security
Committee.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the same
panel, responded, ``We need to get the facts first about matters
that affect the national security of this country.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesdy's hearing set the stage for what is expected to be a
volatile day Thursday, when senior State, Commerce and Defense
department officials will defend the administration's export
control policies in back-to-back House and Senate hearings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the House is to vote Thursday to create a special
select committee that will lead the House inquiry into the China
accusations. Democrats grumble that existing House committees,
including the two that held Wednesday's hearing, are capable of
handling the broader inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared by the House Democratic Policy Committee,
which will be made public Thursday, accuses House Republicans of
spending $17 million on 50 ``politically motivated'' investigations
since Republicans took control of the House in 1995.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, Sokolski, citing information on Chinese
rocket reliability obtained from a Singapore-based web site, Dragon
in Space, that tracks Chinese commercial satellite launches, said
he had no doubt that U.S. space technology that helped Beijing's
military arsenal had been transferred to China. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of international security
studies at the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama
said these assertions were based on ``half-facts that have been
distorted and sensationalized.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers immediately dismissed the professor as
naive. ``The blueprints for all these changes were not left under
their pillow by the tooth fairy,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif.

`DOCTOR OX': A CONCEPTUAL ARTIST'S OPERA
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There is a religious group in the Middle East whose
members adhere strictly to their faith by giving the appearance of
following some other practice. A person may go regularly to church
or mosque, and perform all the usual devotions, while having
beliefs that run in another direction. There might be no way of
distinguishing such a person from the host of other worshipers, or
of telling how many, in a particular congregation, are mouthing the
prayers while thinking something else.
</P>
<P>
   Composers are generally more forthcoming about their belief
systems, and it is clear that the British composer Gavin Bryars is
maintaining his firm position as an outsider _ one who cherishes
John Cage, Erik Satie, Ferruccio Busoni and the parlor music of
three or four generations ago _ even though his music is now being
embraced by the mainstream culture. ``Doctor Ox's Experiment,''
which was given its first performance by English National Opera
here Monday night, is Doctor Bryars' Experiment: a conceptual
artist's opera, put together in a spirit of detachment and
disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   It has many of the qualities that a real opera would have.
Indeed, it exaggerates them. It is, for the most part, terribly
slow moving. It swallows its words. It has absurd characters, love
scenes and a war. It has arias, duets and choruses. It has pretty
much everything, and we know only that it is not a proper opera
because it is so boring.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Morrison's libretto, adapted from a novella by Jules
Verne, seems to have been meant for a different sort of piece:
sparky, witty, thoughtful. It offers good cues for musical drama in
its depiction of a sleepy Flemish village awakened when a mad
scientist releases gas into the local atmosphere. Bryars, though,
encases the first act and much of the second in music that does
what most of his music does: slowly glide, perpetually sag.
</P>
<P>
   It may do so rather beautifully, especially when it brings on
its two countertenor young lovers (David James and Ryland Angel)
and their sweethearts, or when one of the latter (Valdine Alderson)
gives the work its final benediction. But the beauty is drained as
far as possible of meaning. It is beauty forever on the point of
cloying.
</P>
<P>
   The production, by the film director Atom Egoyan, is largely in
moonlit slow motion, while allowing Bonaventura Bottone to make
Doctor Ox himself quick, lively and amiable.

U.S. ARGUES AGAINST CREATING AN INDEPENDENT U.N. PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This story was skedded earlier as TRIBUNAL.) 
(ja) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking to limit the scope of an international criminal
court, the United States on Wednesday dismissed U.N. efforts to
create a fully independent prosecutor as unrealistic and unwise.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that infuriated human rights groups, Bill
Richardson, the U.S. representative at the United Nations, warned
delegates to a U.N. conference here not to turn the court into ``a
human rights ombudsman open to, and responsible for responding to,
any and all complaints from any source.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference has been convened to set up rules to try
individuals for genocide and other crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The United States wants the permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council to play a major role in determining what crimes
and which defendants should be prosecuted by a permanent
international court.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court cannot and should not address every crime that goes
unpunished, no matter how horrific or atrocious it may be,''
Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now Washington finds itself isolated at a conference
where more than 40 other nations, united in what is known as the
like-minded group, and hundreds of human rights groups are pushing
for a fully independent prosecutor with the power to start
investigations as the best means of guaranteeing the court's power
and impartiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we move too quickly,'' Richardson argued, ``we may create a
court that will appear sound on paper but collapse under the weight
of its own mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is concerned that unless the leading powers
have a say in the jurisdiction of the court and what crimes
prosecutors can pursue American servicemen could be taken before
international judges who harbored anti-American agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soldiers deployed far from home need to do their jobs without
exposure to politicized proceedings,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the noble sentiments that have been flowing across the
conference hall, the proceedings themselves are already highly
politicized.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson alluded in his speech to the lobbying efforts of the
like-minded group, led by normally staunch allies like Canada and
Britain. ``The court cannot be the creation of a single group of
nations,'' he said. ``The court must be built on the firm ground of
international consensus and enjoy international support.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the five-week conference delegations will be forced
to debate and seek compromise. The opening statements, in effect,
are opening bids in a complex and lengthy negotiation. On his way
out of the conference, Richardson heatedly said: ``We won't support
the treaty if it has this self-initiating independent prosecutor.
That's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   His position was opposed by Canada, which is chairman of the
conference and which is one of the most active members of the
like-minded group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A court worth having is one with an independent, highly
professional prosecutor,'' Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy of
Canada said in his statement Wednesday morning. ``He or she should
be able to initiate a proceeding ex-officio, rather than having
International Criminal Court jurisdiction triggered only by state
complaint or a Security Council referral.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's statement angered rights groups, who have flooded
the conference, lobbying for as broad and independent a court as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court will have very little business if it is dependent
on states or the Security Council's referring cases to
prosecutors,'' said Richard Dicker, associate counsel for Human
Rights Watch. ``You can just imagine the diplomatic, economic and
security considerations that would come into play before the U.S.
or even a smaller nation would risk lodging a complaint against
China.''
</P>
<P>
   All nations say publicly they want an effective and independent
court. But some countries qualify that by insisting that states
consent to any investigations of their citizens, a restriction that
human rights groups deplore as fatally obstructionist. &QL;

OUTSIDER TO LEAD RAYTHEON CO. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. Wednesday tapped an amateur rodeo cowboy _ the
first outsider in its history _ to take the reins of the giant
Lexington-based defense and technology firm.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel P. Burnham, 51, a top official at AlliedSignal Inc., will
join Raytheon as president and chief operating officer _ the
company's number two post _ on July 1. He will then be promoted to
chief executive officer on Dec. 1, when Dennis J. Picard steps
down, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Picard, who has worked at Raytheon for 45 years, intends to
remain chairman of the board of directors until sometime in 1999.
He has said he will stay as chairman for no more than another
year &UR;  &LR; after Burnham becomes CEO, but will leave earlier if he
believes the company is in good hands. When Picard, 65, is fully
retired, it is expected that the board will name Burnham as
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A company steeped in tradition, Raytheon has had only four
leaders in its 76-year history _ all of whom were long-time
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to search outside the company for the next
chief executive is a result of the dramatic changes that Raytheon
has undergone in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Once a mid-tier supplier of missiles and defense electronics,
Raytheon leapt to the elite ranks of the US defense industry last
year with its acquisitions of the defense businesses of Texas
Instruments Inc. and Hughes Electronics Corp..
</P>
<P>
   It is now the nation's No. 3 defense company, behind Boeing Co.
and Lockheed Martin Corp., with annual revenues of about $21
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But in the face of cutbacks in Pentagon spending, Raytheon has
also embarked on a strategy to convert defense technology into
business applications. As a result, it is a major provider of
commercial electronics, such as air traffic control systems and
marine radar. It also makes business jets and provides engineering
and construction services for power plants and other industrial
projects worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, who is vice chairman of AlliedSignal, has the right mix
of experience to help Raytheon grow all of those businesses, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan is among the very few senior executives who actually
possess proven track records in both commercial and defense
industries, here at home and internationally,'' said Picard in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company hired an executive search firm to identify
candidates to succeed Picard, Raytheon said it approached Burnham
directly because of his reputation in the aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the guy we wanted. We went after him because his
background maps so well with our strategy,'' said Raytheon
spokesman Robert McWade.
</P>
<P>
   At AlliedSignal, a New Jersey conglomerate, Burnham is
responsible for six aerospace-related businesses with $8 billion in
annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of two internal candidates to succeed AlliedSignal
chairman and chief executive Lawrence Bossidy in April 2000, but
analysts said he probably was persuaded to join the larger Raytheon
because he was assured the top job.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham has run the aerospace unit _ AlliedSignal's largest _
since 1992. It supplies engines, avionics and electronic safety
systems to aircraft manufacturers worldwide, including Raytheon
Aircraft Co., Raytheon's Wichita-based subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   When he was promoted to vice chairman of Allied-Signal last
October, he was also tapped as the company's czar of productivity _
responsible for company-wide initiatives to boost efficiency and
root out manufacturing defects. Allied-Signal is considered to be a
global leader in productivity and it's expected that Burnham will
make a similar productivity push at Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, who was not available for comment Wednesday, is known
for cutting costs. At a January 1991 AlliedSignal meeting, fresh
off a quarter of record earnings, he ordered that a plan be crafted
to cut overhead 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``My speech was `Congratulations. If we keep doing what we are
doing, we'll all be out of work in two years,' '' he said in an
October interview with Defense Week, an industry newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   At Raytheon, Burnham's challenge is to oversee the consolidation
of Raytheon's far-flung defense businesses, now that its
acquisition binge is over. He must also get the struggling
engineering business back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon said in January that it would cut more than 8 percent
of its work force, or 9,700 jobs, and shut 20 defense facilities
following the acquisitions. Those cuts, which included 1,000 jobs
from the engineering business, are expected to occur over the next
year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised Raytheon's choice, saying Burnham has what the
giant company needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the right person at the right place at the right time,''
said PaineWebber analyst Jack Modzelewski, who raised his rating on
Raytheon to ``buy'' from ``neutral.'' Raytheon's B shares rose 2
3/16 to 54 3/16 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, who was born in a suburb of Detroit, has strong roots
in New England. His late parents were born and raised in Boston,
and as a child, he spent summers on Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Xavier University in Cincinnati, Burnham
received an MBA from the University of New Hampshire. He also lived
in Framingham, Mass. for two years early in his career, when he
worked for RCA's computer systems division.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his four grown children live in the Boston area, so he
and his wife, Meg, are looking forward to relocating here, said an
AlliedSignal spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   His personal interests are wide-ranging. A student of medieval
literature, he is also a fan of modern fiction and auto racing. He
also loves horseback riding, and competes regularly in rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   Described by colleagues as bright and personable, Burnham is
renowned for his stellar vocabulary. ``He'll come up with these
off-the-cuff, $10 words that are unintentional _ they're not meant
to impress anybody,'' said Allied-Signal spokesman Mark Greenberg.
``He has a vocabulary you wouldn't expect to find in a business
executive.''

A GREENER LAWN AND A NEW SOUND TO VERDI
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``That's an $18 million lawn you are sitting on,''
Henry Stern, the New York City Commissioner of Parks and
Recreation, told the estimated crowd of 15,000 people who turned
out on Tuesday night for this summer's first free performance of
the Met in the Parks series on the Great Lawn in Central Park. ``So
be good to it. Don't step too hard. Don't leave anything on it.''
</P>
<P>
   And, truly, the newly renovated Great Lawn is something for New
Yorkers to treasure. Before the renovation, a heavy rain like that
on Monday night would have left the lawn a mud puddle for days. But
on Tuesday, for the Metropolitan Opera's concert performance of
Verdi's ``Trovatore,'' the thick grass was lush, green and
remarkably dry. Predictions of additional rain may have kept the
attendance down from what was expected. But only once, during Act
III, did a short shower threaten to halt the performance.
</P>
<P>
   Musically speaking, another renovation was unveiled. This year,
courtesy of a $100,000 grant, an improved sound system was tried
out. And with an in-house engineer from the Met controlling
balances, the quality of amplification was about as good as one
could expect at an outdoor classical music event. The sound was
surprisingly clear, warm and present without being overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   And it seemed to make a difference to the audience. Met in the
Parks performances are not occasions for intensely focused
listening. But the audience was noticeably quiet, especially during
the most reflective and subtle sections of Verdi's popular score.
</P>
<P>
   The soprano June Anderson, who scored a success in the role of
Leonora this spring at the Met, gave an affecting and vocally
radiant performance. The Russian mezzo-soprano Larissa Diadkova, so
impressive during the Kirov Opera Festival at the Met this spring,
performed her first Azucena, the Gypsy mother, a chilling,
blazingly sung account of a daunting role.
</P>
<P>
   More news was made by the brothers Armiliato, that is, Fabio,
the tenor and Met regular, and Marco, a conductor making his first
appearance with the company. This was the first time in the Met's
history that two brothers were performing together, said the Met's
general manager, Joseph Volpe, and their proud parents, he added,
had come from Genoa for the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Fabio Armiliato gave an impassioned and involving, though not
always controlled, performance as Manrico. Marco Armiliato presided
over a poised, elegant rendition of the score, allowing much leeway
for expressive instrumental solos by the fine Met Orchestra
players. The baritone Haijing Fu as the Count di Luna and the
veteran bass Paul Plishka as Ferrando gave solid performances.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the Met's summer caravan troupe will present ``Il
Trovatore'' at Miller Field on Staten Island. Four performances
follow at parks in Brooklyn, the Bronx and New Jersey through July
3. The other opera the Met is taking to the parks, through July 2,
is Rossini's ``Barbieri di Siviglia,'' including a performance on
the Great Lawn on June 23.

MARKET PLACE: DID RUBIN SET BEAR TRAP FOR CURRENCY TRADERS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also DOLLAR-YEN, JAPAN-ECONSCENE, MARKET.)  
(dc) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin made
comments to Congress that currency traders took as a green light to
sell billions more yen, driving the currency down to near an
eight-year low.
</P>
<P>
   The academic but economically correct testimony was interpreted
as a declaration that the United States would not intervene in the
currency markets to support the weakening Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as the dust cleared from an initially successful
surprise intervention to support the yen, traders and analysts were
wondering if they had been set up for a fall by their
interpretation, even if it was wrong, of the treasury secretary's
sell signal. After all, Rubin did make his mark trading on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   His comments, they said, helped get more investors out on a limb
on their bet against the yen. That meant that they scrambled for
safety _ and to cut their losses _ much faster when Rubin
threatened to cut them off. And that panic selling is what helped
push the yen up 5.2 percent in one day against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders and analysts would not say that Rubin did this
on purpose. But they did agree that his remarks propelled the sharp
fall in the yen last Thursday and Monday and stretched investors,
making the snapback bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect of those remarks were to make the market more
susceptible,'' said John Lipsky, the chief economist at Chase
Manhattan Bank and long-time currency watcher. ``Certainly, there
will be speculation by market participants that they had been set
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders and analysts agreed that Wednesday's intervention, the
first to support the yen since 1992 and the first of any kind by
the United States since August 1995, was effective for a day. But
they expect the yen will resume its decline unless there are some
surprising changes of policy in Japan. Even after the rebound, the
yen is still down 16.9 percent against the dollar over the last
year and off 41 percent from its April 1995 high.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Fand, senior foreign exchange strategist at Bank Boston,
said that he saw speculators buying dollars Wednesday on the bet
that the intervention would not support the yen for long.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin agrees that intervention is not effective for long without
changes in policies that, in this case, support the yen. His
emphasis of that point last week led to the additional heavy yen
selling. New policies are necessary because only a change in
Japan's economic outlook _ the economy is now in a recession _ will
make Japan and the yen attractive to investors again.
</P>
<P>
   But taking convincing action immediately will be difficult
because there are elections in July and the Japanese government,
which has announced a long series of disappointing programs to
stimulate the economy, has little credibility in the foreign
exchange market. New promises of action made Wednesday, like
dealing with the mountain of bad bank debt, were generally
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a little worried,'' said Robert White, the treasurer of
Standard Chartered Bank. ``We have taken this step to intervene
with Japanese promises and the Japanese have been known to break
their promises.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the lack of any new concrete actions by the Japanese and
Rubin's own distrust of intervention without policy changes, Lipsky
said the whole operation ``leaves the impression of an emergency
measure that would temporarily stave off significant market
instability.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first tests for the yen will come with the results
from this weekend's meeting of Japanese officials in Tokyo with
Lawrence Summers, the deputy treasury secretary, and William
McDonough, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,
through which the intervention was done. If there are no positive
surprises, more intervention might be needed to support the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Traders also said that they thought the intervention by the
Clinton administration was motivated by the recent threats from
China that a further decline in the yen would force the Chinese to
devalue their currency, setting off another round of devaluations
in Asia that would further destabilize the region economically.
</P>
<P>
   In timing Wednesday's buying of yen for dollars, it appeared
that the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were able to take
advantage of two tactics of intervention. First, whether
intentionally or not, they let the dollar rally far and fast and
left traders with the impression they would not get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Intervening in this circumstance, which has been called a bear
trap, can catch traders off guard, a key to intervention success.
Some traders said they had seen some speculating hedge funds piling
on their yen selling last week, which meant some faced the sharp
losses needed to force them to sell dollars and buy yen Wednesday.
But most hedge funds had been selling yen for some time so overall
they probably still have profits.
</P>
<P>
   The second tactic is pushing a currency in the direction it is
already going and the Treasury and the Fed were able to do this
because of the sudden rally of the yen Tuesday, as traders wondered
finally if something was up after the Treasury indicated Summers
would go to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Sargen, the global market strategist for J.P. Morgan's
private clients, doubts that Rubin tried to set up the market. ``He
risks losing his own credibility doing that,'' Sargen said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said that his comments last week ``snowballed on
him,'' accelerating the crisis. And Wednesday's move was an effort
to make clear ``that there is not a green light to go out there and
sell yen.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, Rubin proved he learned something else from
his Wall Street career: how to take advantage of mistakes.

SECRETARY OF STATE RESPONDS TO OVERTURES FROM IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also IRAN-U.S.) 
(ps) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the Clinton administration's first formal response
to cautious overtures from a moderate president of Iran, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright invited the Iranians on Wednesday to
join the United States in drawing up ``a road map leading to normal
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after the 1979 Iranian Revolution ruptured
relations with Washington and installed a fundamentalist Islamic
government in Tehran, Albright said that it was time to find ways
to bridge the gap between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to do so would be irresponsible,'' she said, insisting
that the United States had no quarrel with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, long regarded as one of the administration's harshest
critics of Iran, changed course in a speech prepared for delivery
in New York and hailed President Mohammad Khatami, who took office
last summer, as a man who ``deserves respect because he is the
choice of the Iranian people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secretary of State went on to list steps Iran has taken in
recent months that have been viewed favorably in Washington,
including giving public support to Yasser Arafat rather than more
radical leaders or groups as the voice of Palestinians in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Khatami had denounced terrorism and condemned the
killing of civilians in Israel in January. She also mentioned
Iran's record in fighting drugs and its efforts to help bring peace
to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view these developments with interest, both with regard to
the possibility of Iran assuming its rightful place in the world
community, and the chance for better bilateral ties,'' Albright
said in a speech to the Asia Society that looked broadly across the
region from Iran to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, Albright repeated American concerns about
Iran's attempts to acquire missiles and weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical and nuclear arms. She also lamented
``inflammatory and unacceptable'' Iranian denunciations of Israel,
which Tehran does not recognize.
</P>
<P>
   She asked for more progress in ending serious abuses of human
rights. She did not mention the case of Salman Rushdie, the
Indian-born British writer on whom the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini pronounced a death sentence for blasphemy after the
publication in 1988 of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel in which
Muslims found derogatory references to their faith and its founder.
A senior official said tonight that this issue has always been part
of the administration's human rights agenda on Iran, and it was not
necessary to mention it on every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Noting relaxed rules on travel to and from Iran, Albright said
that cultural and academic exchanges are being actively supported
and that ``we are ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Islamic Republic should consider parallel steps,'' she
said. ``If such a process can be initiated and sustained in a way
that addresses the concerns of both sides, then we in the United
States can see a very different relationship. As the wall of
mistrust comes down, we can develop with the Islamic republic, when
it is ready, a road map leading to normal relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke tonight against a backdrop of deep and unsettling
changes in Asia that administration officials said played a part in
her opening to Iran. Nuclear tests in India and Pakistan have
abruptly changed the atmosphere across the region, sparking
concerns that Iran as well as Iraq could renew hopes of developing
nuclear arms. At the moment the United States has no leverage in
Iran, and is losing support for its policy of continued sanctions
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore the Asian economic crisis is beginning to have
ripple effects around the world, adding to the problems India and
Pakistan will face because of the loss of World Bank loans and
other financial assistance as a result of the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis figured in Albright's speech. On the
day that President Clinton stepped in to support the faltering
Japanese currency, she told the Japanese that ``more needs to be
done'' to contain the crisis. ''Action is essential to strengthen
Japan's economy so it can once more serve as the engine of Asian
growth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Indonesia, which she described as ``a country of critical
strategic importance'' to the United States, Albright stopped short
of endorsing President B.J. Habibie's proposals for the gradual
establishment of a genuinely democratic electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   But in a gesture of confidence, she announced that all American
diplomats evacuated from the country in May during the unrest that
led to the fall of President Suharto would now return, and that the
United States would step up aid in food and support for democratic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still the largest portion of her address was devoted to Iran and
the administration's long-delayed response to overtures made to the
United States by President Khatami in an interview with CNN in
January. In that interview, Khatami, who was elected a year ago
despite the opposition of the country's conservative religious
leadership, spoke of his respect for the American government
because it reflected ``the great American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who was elected with the strong support of Iranian
women and others in the society who hope for a relaxation of almost
20 years of harsh Islamic rule, has recently come under new
pressures from conservatives who want to reverse the trend. Some
experts have criticized the Clinton administration for not
extending, however carefully or warily, a hand of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Albright went out of her way in her speech to demonstrate that
the United States was not ``anti-Islamic'' and that Americans would
do well to learn to understand ``Eastern civilization and Islamic
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Islam is the fastest-growing religious faith in the United
States,'' she said. ``We respect deeply its moral teachings and its
role as a source of inspiration and instruction for hundreds of
millions of people around the world.''

IS THIS A MATTER OF RIGHT OR MIGHT?
</HEADLINE>

By JANET TYSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's high noon in Texas. The gunfighters approach one another,
fingers twitching, eyes glinting in the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   One stands up for all of the state's high-minded designers,
patrons and critics who consider architecture a form of progressive
art.
</P>
<P>
   The other represents entrepreneurs more concerned with popular
opinion, the bottom line and audience comfort level rather than
with critical opinion and artistic ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The first group is responsible for Texas buildings by Frank
Lloyd Wright, I.M. Pei, Louis Kahn, Philip Johnson, Richard Meier,
Tadao Ando, Ricardo Legorreta, Rafael Moneo, Renzo Piano and other
architects approved by a well-intended, international elite. Kahn,
for instance, designed the critically praised Kimbell Art Museum
and Johnson the Amon Carter Museum; Ando is working on a new home
for the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The latter group has brought us a number of buildings and urban
projects _ all, so far, in North Texas _ by David Schwarz. With
offices in Washington, D.C., and Fort Worth, Schwarz has played an
intrinsic role in the Bass family's redevelopment of much of
downtown Fort Worth. His first big, local project, though, was in
the medical district: the castlelike Cook Children's Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   More recent is Schwarz's Bass performance hall in Fort Worth.
Just announced is his winning proposal for a new sports arena for
the Dallas Stars hockey team and Mavericks basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Both the performance hall and the arena proposal declare
Schwarz's signature mix of historic styles with high-tech
infrastructure. The multipurpose Bass performance hall marries a
beaux-arts plan and early modern decorations. The Dallas arena, in
one preliminary sketch, combines elements of the old TWA terminal
in St. Louis with the facade and tower of Will Rogers Memorial
Complex in Fort Worth. (However, that's not necessarily how the
finished product will look; Schwarz will start the design from
scratch.)
</P>
<P>
   The critical response to both projects has ranged from qualified
acceptance to outraged disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   While crediting the performance hall's ``genuine beauties,''
critic Willard Spiegelman adds that `` ... one wonders whether Mr.
Schwarz has nodded too nostalgically to the past or in the
direction of safe charm,'' in his ``Wall Street Journal'' review of
the hall.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... another piece of lick-and-stick architecture,'' writes
``Dallas Morning News'' architecture critic David Dillon in his
response to the arena announcement. He adds that Schwarz's message
to arena executives ``was not `I believe such and such,' but `Tell
me what you like, and I'll give it to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   With such high-profile examples of buildings as high art and
buildings as populist design, it might seem that Texas is sending
mixed signals about how seriously we take architecture. On one
hand, we've got our Pritzker Prize laureates and AIA gold medalists
working on an unprecedented number of Texas museums. On the other,
we have Schwarz fielding commissions to design a number of
important public structures in his trademark mix of retro styles.
</P>
<P>
   Every project sent to Schwarz, critics say, becomes a lost
opportunity to say something meaningful about the prospects of an
architecture for the future. And, they add, in cases where Schwarz
beats out other competitors for a commission, the competition
process becomes a mockery.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I can agree with the latter complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily because _ and, although this is a flawed comparison,
it will have to do _ competitions like those for the Dallas arena
and The Ballpark in Arlington are like pitting Norman Rockwell
against Andy Warhol, Gerhard Richter and Carrie Mae Weems to design
a cover for ``Life'' magazine. It's apples and oranges. You either
want a heartwarming picture or you don't. If you don't, why include
Rockwell? If you do, don't pretend those other people have a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth competition that
Schwarz didn't win often was perceived as less-than-serious,
although not an outright mockery, because Schwarz was included as a
courtesy. As such, he was the apple in a gathering of oranges
comprising Legoretta, Richard Gluckman, Carlos Jimenez, Arata
Isozaki and Ando, to whom the commission was given.
</P>
<P>
   But calling a Schwarz commission a lost opportunity is unfair
and inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   What Schwarz does reflects an important force in our
contemporary world. It's a force that rejects modernist visions of
ongoing artistic and architectural progress, and also ignores the
irony expressed in works by other progressive architectural
thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unabashedly populist and pragmatic approach _ and not
lacking in innovative solutions. It is every bit as nostalgic as
critics accuse it of being: an architecture of the warm and fuzzy,
if you will.
</P>
<P>
   But is remains an architecture with sufficient validity that it
warrants more serious, unbiased consideration than it has received.
</P>
<P>
   Would I want to see every project take this turn? No way. But
I'd like to see eclectic historicism given its due.
</P>
<P>
   If it were, Schwarz might receive some real competition. And the
quality of this potentially influential parallel to progressive
architecture might overall be raised.
</P>
<P>
   So here's how my script concludes:
</P>
<P>
   The gunfighters fill their hands and fire. But, when the dust
settles, they both still are standing.
</P>
<P>
   The picture fades, the credits roll, the questions linger and a
possibility tantalizes: Perhaps our antagonists decided the
territory is big enough for both of them.

NAACP SEEKS HALT OF BIAS AT FEDERAL AGENCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ESTELLA DURAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The NAACP is threatening a massive demonstration
here against federal agencies it believes discriminate against
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to picket all of the federal agencies if they
don't get their acts together,'' said Leroy W. Warren, an NAACP
board member, who described the discrimination as ``rampant.''
``These agencies are not following the government's regulations on
employment discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who did not say when such picketing would occur, made
his comments at a breakfast with reporters Wednesday, as the
civil-rights group released its report on employment discrimination
in the federal workplace. The report alleges that six agencies
racially and sexually discriminate against their employees and
retaliate against those who file equal employment opportunity
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the agencies Wednesday acknowledged that they faced
problems in dealing with discrimination, and said they were doing
their best to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The report listed hundreds of complaints from employees at the
US Department of Agriculture, the Library of Congress, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp., the Department of the Interior, the
Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Defense. Warren said
a final study, reviewing additional agencies, will be released this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is appalling that minorities are being retaliated against
for filing complaints about discrimination,'' Warren said. ``They
are being demoted, passed up for promotions, and their lives are
being ruined because they spoke up.''
</P>
<P>
   The equal employment opportunity program is not effectively
protecting federal employees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The EEO is out of control,'' he said. ``A bunch of these EEO
officers ought to be fired.''
</P>
<P>
   But Warren said that some of the blame for the difficulties
within the federal agencies belongs with black personnel directors
who, he said, discriminate against blacks and other minority
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King and too many other people have died for us
to have black people as gatekeepers keeping us out of the jobs we
deserve,'' he said. ``All of you Uncle Toms and Aunt Toms out
there, you aren't going to stop us from picketing. We aren't about
to be sold like some people are.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Helen Thompson, spokesperson for the Department of the
Interior, said the agency is aware it has problems regarding
discrimination against minority employees. Because of this, the
department launched a diversity program about six months ago, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We, at all levels of management, are committed to rectifying
this problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Sparks, the Agriculture Department's special assistant to
the secretary for civil rights, said the agency is also aware that
it has diversity and discrimination issues to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be the first to say that we have a long way to go and a
lot to do,'' he said. ``But we understand these issues are
important, and we have been working with minority employee groups
to do whatever we can to resolve problems that exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hubenak, spokesperson for the IRS, said he could not comment
on the report specifically, but he said the IRS does not tolerate
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a policy against all forms of discrimination at the
IRS,'' he said. ``We don't support it nor condone it. We are
committed to doing everything under the law to ensure equal
opportunity and fair treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokespersons for the FDIC and the Library of Congress said they
were not prepared to issue a statement about the report, because
they did not have a chance to fully review it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't see this report before it was handed out, and we're
looking at it now, but we have no comment until we've gone over it
fully,'' FDIC spokesperson Phil Battey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Tom Begines, spokesman for the Defense Department, said
he could not comment on the NAACP report because he did not have
time to fully analyze it. But he referred to a May 16 statement by
Defense Secretary William Cohen that the military ``is one of the
most racially integrated institutions in America.''

<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ The bombing at the abortion clinic here
changed the face of Emily Lyons forever and left a co-worker dead,
but its impact on the battle over abortion in Birmingham has faded
since that Jan. 29 morning. The blast maimed and almost blinded
Mrs. Lyons, a nurse and counselor, but while she can see only a
little, she can see that little has changed.
</P>
<P>
   In the parking lot of Milo's hamburger stand, a few blocks from
where the bomb scorched the front of the New Woman All Women Health
Care Center, a bumper sticker on a Buick warns, ``Abortions Stop
Heartbeats.'' At the center, the picket lines are made up of
familiar faces _ nurses at the clinic know protesters by name _ who
shout familiar warnings to pregnant women who keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   All the bomber did was end one life and drastically alter
another, Mrs. Lyons said, as this city _ and both sides in a
seething, long-running confrontation _ went cautiously back to
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``What,'' Mrs. Lyons asks of the bomber, ``were you thinking?''
</P>
<P>
   A police officer, Robert Sanderson, who was trying to earn some
side money as a security guard at the clinic, is dead. Mrs. Lyons,
who often counseled patients to go home if she felt they were
unsure about having an abortion, lost her left eye and is
undergoing a series of surgeries to repair her right eye. She has
had to learn to walk again on legs shattered by the bomb intended
to kill and injure, not to topple walls or set fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't affect anyone that much,'' said Mrs. Lyons, a
41-year-old mother of two daughters, 17 and 13 years old. ``Nobody
quit the clinic where I worked. They're all just stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes that she is, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a wallflower,'' Mrs. Lyons said. ``But I'm not
intimidated by anything anymore. Now that I've made it through
this, now that I've been blown up, I don't think there's anything
that can.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I may never be in a pair of heels again in my whole life,''
she said, referring to her badly injured legs. ``But so be it. Yes,
it's sad. But the options are worse. I could be 6 feet under.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not even believe that what happened at the clinic is
the work of an anti-abortion zealot, she said. ``The pro-life
protesters we had, we all knew by name,'' she said. ``I hate to say
it, but you just kind of wrote them off as morons, some of them,
and ignored them.''
</P>
<P>
   She does not want to waste on anger the energy she needs for
rehabilitation, but it creeps into her voice when she talks about
the explosion, which happened as she and Sanderson stood at the
center's entrance. The bomb, a fragmentation device studded with
nails, was set to go off as clinic employees arrived for work,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lyons does not pretend to forgive the bomber, who police
say they believe is 31-year-old Eric Robert Rudolph, a fugitive who
is being hunted nationwide. Rudolph was seen running from the area
of the clinic minutes after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the blast, still sightless, racked with
pain and covered with fresh scars, Mrs. Lyons held a news
conference from her wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show the world the end effect of a senseless act,''
she said. She called on the bomber to turn himself in, to take
responsibility for the act that she will live with for the rest of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   The bomber, she said, ``was fanatical.'' If it is Rudolph, she
said, she wants to see him brought in, ``dead or alive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Alive would be pretty good,'' Mrs. Lyons said, ``but it really
doesn't matter. They could just tell me it was him in a coffin,
though, and I'd be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators and others involved in the case have called Mrs.
Lyons the flip side to the bomber's cowardice. The months since
that blast have been a nightmare of operations and physical
therapy, but she now believes that she will ``soon be able to drive
and read and jump, all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bones in her shins were shattered and the skin on her legs
shredded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can walk,'' she said, ``but I can't do it for very long,
because of the swelling.''
</P>
<P>
   She is confident she will eventually see well enough to lead a
normal life, although ``normal'' means different things now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't go back to the clinic,'' she said. ``It's just too
physically demanding. I just don't have the dexterity.''
</P>
<P>
   She would if she could. The bomber, she said, did not scare her
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed in what I did,'' said Mrs. Lyons, who has also
worked with infants and the elderly in more than 20 years of
delivering health care. ``Some people questioned if I was ashamed
of what I did, and the answer is `no.' I wouldn't let somebody like
him keep me away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry about the things I have to miss: my job, reading,
driving. I'm angry about my limitations.'' For now, her 17-year-old
daughter drives her around, which she concedes is a little
frightening in itself. ``At least she's in her own car,'' which she
would be less prone to wreck, Mrs. Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she thrived on the love and support of her husband,
Jeff Lyons, who owns a computer business, and of her daughters. She
has been amazed at how many people have called or written to tell
her how they have been affected by what happened to her. Most of
those have been good, but someone wrote that she would die in a
``lake of fire'' because of her work at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already been in a lake of fire,'' Mrs. Lyons said.

DEAD CHILD'S MOTHER URGES CONGRESS TO MAKE GUNS SAFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Suzann Wilson wept Wednesday as she remembered the
last time her 11-year-old daughter skipped out the door and headed
for school. Last March, her daughter Brittheny, three other
children, and a teacher were shot and killed by two schoolmates in
Jonesboro, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson made an emotional appeal to Congress, which has been
hostile toward gun control, to pass legislation that would impose
new child-resistant devices on handguns and make it more difficult
for juveniles to obtain guns.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require new safety standards on all
handguns, including a child-resistance trigger, a child safety lock
and a magazine disconnect safety for pistols. The bill also would
prohibit the sale of an assault weapon to anyone under 18, raise
the penalties for selling a gun to a juvenile, require two forms of
identification for any gun purchaser under the age of 24, and
impose fines on gun owners if a child gains access to a loaded
firearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``On March 24th, our daughter went to school and walked out the
door and out of our lives,'' Wilson said between sobs.
</P>
<P>
   She described how she warned her little girl to avoid strangers
and come home before dark but never thought to caution the
middle-school student about leaving the school building for a fire
alarm. Two boys, ages 11 and 13, tripped the alarm and shot at
their classmates as they exited the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you know?'' she cried. ``As a parent, I have to be
very supportive of this bill. It's not about taking away any
rights. It's about giving the right to children to have an
education ... This is not an issue that is going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanya K. Metaksa, lobbyist for the National Rifle Association,
which opposes such legislation, later said a national standard was
``unsound and unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What may be a safe condition for one family can become certain
tragedy for another family faced with violent intruders,'' she said
about the resistant devices. ``One size does not fit all.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference with Wilson were two other women touched
by gun violence: Sarah Brady, the wife of former White House
spokesman Jim Brady who was severely wounded during an
assassination attempt on President Reagan, and Representative
Carolyn McCarthy, a New York Democrat whose husband was killed and
son was severely wounded by a gunman on a Long Island commuter
train.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a society we can no longer accept an epidemic of gun
violence that is killing more children than the polio epidemic at
its height,'' Brady said. She said 14 children die each day in the
United States as a result of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy, whose two brothers were shot and
killed, said he will attempt to attach the legislation as an
amendment to the juvenile justice bill that already has passed the
House and is pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural fit,'' said Kennedy.

BOSTON READIES PLAN TO WOO DEMOCRAT CONVENTION PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY RAKOWSKY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Just use your imagination. That's what city officials
plan to tell Democratic National Committee members scouting sites
for their convention in 2000 when they visit here next week.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the Fleet Center without cranes and backhoes surrounding
it. Ignore the hardhat site near the airport and picture a finished
800-room Hilton instead. And the Big Dig? Imagine if it was all
underground.
</P>
<P>
   In the homestretch to land what would be a gigantic prize of
hosting the presidential convention, the Menino administration is
scrambling to spruce up the city and Wednesday released a schedule
for the 50-member delegation that includes a shopping spree in
Filene's Basement, and late-night billiards at Jillian's in Quincy
Marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   And to help them imagine what the city will look like in 2000,
Boston has employed some high-tech visual aids, expensive computer
models and diagrams that replicates the future cityscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they see in two years will be much better,'' said Mayor
Thomas M. Menino, who will lead a 6 a.m. walk through the South End
next Tuesday. ``They have to imagine that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the Big Dig is scheduled to be at maximum construction in
2000, it will be underground rather and most of the more disruptive
work going on now on surface streets will be gone, said Howard
Liebowitz, the mayor's point person on the DNC bid.
</P>
<P>
   By August 2000, there will be a large clear space around the
Fleet Center that will be suitable for parking semi-tractor
trailers that TV production crews would bring in, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Democrats will hear that traffic in August is
17 percent lighter than the June car traffic they will see next
week, due to vacations and the absence of college students.
</P>
<P>
   ``August 2000 will be a great time to be at the Fleet Center,''
said Kelley Quinn, a key architect of the city's DNC bid.
</P>
<P>
   Other computer models will depict how the Fleet Center could
accommodate legions of working journalists in the underground
parking garage, which the Secret Service likely would close anyway,
said Quinn. The garage is already air-conditioned and could easily
be outfitted with telecommunications equipment, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet Center also offers movable luxury boxes and a TV
production crew that has been hired to do major shows and
tournaments in other venues, she said. The visiting Democrats will
even be flattered at the end of their tour of facility of video
taken of them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is in fact crowing about having more hotels within a
brief subway or bus ride than its top competitors _ Philadelphia
and Los Angeles _ even an improvement over Chicago, where some
delegates had to ride for up to an hour from their hotel to the
United Center, Liebowitz said.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel rooms, Menino said ``are a non-issue.''

FLINT STRIKE PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON TRANSFER OF JOBS OVERSEAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story is a photo reefer on the Times frontpage) 
(ps) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ The 12-day-old strike against General Motors
began as a little-watched, local dispute at a single metal-shaping
plant here, but the walkout has quickly snowballed into a strike of
national importance.
</P>
<P>
   Now not just one plant, but instead 17 are closed, as parts
shortages created by the strike have shut down most operations at
the world's largest auto maker, a company accounting for 1 percent
of the nation's economic output.
</P>
<P>
   And although the walkout involves a tangle of issues, the strike
has focused increasingly on an issue of paramount concern to
millions of workers across America: the transfer of jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on strike to protect our jobs, and that's an issue
everyone cares about,'' said John Falk, a strapping auto worker who
spent his 40th birthday on the picket line along with his
11-year-old son. ``GM has everyone worried they're going to shut
everything down and move our jobs overseas, but we want to save
some good-paying jobs so kids like 11-year-old Charlie here can
have a good standard of living.''
</P>
<P>
   But GM sees things differently. Ever since 3,400 workers walked
off the job on June 5 at the metal-stamping plant here, GM
officials have insisted that the main issue in the dispute is the
company's need to trim costs further so it can compete better with
Ford, Chrysler and Japanese automakers. To do that, GM is demanding
greater leeway to rely on lower-cost plants, usually nonunion and
often overseas, to supply parts now made at GM plants, a practice
known as outsourcing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union has accused GM of putting America last,'' said
Harley Shaiken, a professor of industrial relations at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``This dispute is the most
visible example of offshore outsourcing becoming the issue in a
strike with major national implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America began embracing outsourcing in the 1980's, but
the phenomenon has gathered steam in recent years as tariffs and
trade barriers have fallen, making it easier and cheaper for
companies like Caterpillar and New Balance shoes to buy many parts
from abroad instead of making them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   As the practice has spread, unions have fought back, with mixed
success, mostly at the bargaining table and rarely through strikes.
But now, with General Motors aggressively pushing to move more work
to nonunion plants, at home and abroad, the United Automobile
Workers, emboldened by a booming economy and low unemployment, has
decided to strike. The auto workers' tough stand against
outsourcing is being watched closely by unions and other industries
where outsourcing is growing: machinery, apparel, electronics and
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The strike pits the nation's largest manufacturer versus the
nation's most powerful and arguably most respected union _ a union
at the top of labor's firmament, one known for its toughness on the
picket line and shrewdness in delivering at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   With some analysts predicting that the dispute could become the
biggest auto industry showdown since the 1970 walkout that shut
down GM for three months, the way this strike turns out could cast
a long shadow on labor-management relations nationwide and on how
hard or easy it will be for other companies to turn to outsourcing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labor movement has to be watching this very closely
because the UAW is standing up for every union that is worried by
the transfer of jobs overseas,'' said David L. Lewis, a professor
of business history at the University of Michigan. ``It's a
life-and-death struggle. General Motors is determined to transfer
many of these jobs out of the country, and the UAW simply can't
have it. If the UAW fails, many unions will find it all the more
difficult to prevent outsourcing. This trend, this outsourcing will
be accelerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The union is triply angry about GM's new push for outsourcing.
The effort could cause additional plant closings, forcing many
workers to relocate and eliminating jobs that well-paid auto
workers hoped might someday go to their children.
</P>
<P>
   GM's effort could also sap the union's power, membership and
treasury by further reducing its numbers. Its membership has
dropped from 1.5 million in the 1970's to 800,000 today as the auto
industry has downsized, in part because of strong Japanese imports.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, union officials say they are especially irked because in
their view, General Motors, in its new outsourcing offensive, is
violating the contract that the Flint local signed last year in
which it accepted numerous steps to increase productivity. The
Flint workers accuse GM of reneging on its commitment to invest
$300 million in the metal-stamping plant so it can build parts for
a new light truck. For its part, GM accuses the union of not
carrying out several promised productivity measures.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for the auto workers for numerous reasons,
symbolic and substantive. With General Motors showing new vigor in
its erratic efforts to cut costs, the UAW wants to send a powerful
message that it will put up costly roadblocks if GM seeks to do
this by downsizing its American plants and work force beyond what
the union has already agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown also carries much symbolic significance because
Flint is the cradle of the United Auto Workers. It is the city
where storied sitdown strikes took place in the 1930s and where
Walter Reuther, the legendary figure who built the union in the
1930s and 1940s, first made his mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the birthplace of the UAW, the home of the
sitdowners,'' said Claudia Perkins, a union representative at GM's
Delphi East parts plant here. ``If they bust the Flinters, they'll
bust the stronghold of the UAW. This is very important.
</P>
<P>
   Many workers suspect that GM has grown weary of Flint and its
labor militancy. Many workers here are convinced that GM will
eventually shut its five remaining plants here, in no small part
because over the last decade it has already closed three plants
here.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At dozens of Flint workers stand in the hot sun waving ``On
Strike'' placards, the strikers are convinced that the public backs
them strongly. Fully one out of two cars driving past honks in
solidarity, while many neighbors and store owners have plied them
with pizzas, donuts and sodas. One barber gave the strikers
discount slips for haircuts.
</P>
<P>
   But, many labor experts say, this show of hometown support masks
the ambivalence that many Americans feel toward the auto workers.
There is widespread envy _ and even resentment _ toward these
members of the blue-collar elite, who have among the best salaries
and benefits of workers anywhere. Before overtime they earn $40,000
a year, and with overtime, often more than $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   The public has certainly not rallied behind the auto workers the
way it rallied behind the teamsters in last August's walkout by
185,000 workers at the United Parcel Service. One reason is
millions of Americans know and like their dependable UPS drivers,
while auto workers toil unseen behind factory walls. Another reason
is the teamsters, unlike the proud, go-it-alone auto workers,
worked assiduously before walking out to line up public support and
from the beginning emphasized an issue that it knew would resonate
with the public: UPS was seeking to create more part-time jobs that
would not pay enough to support a family.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to explain the public's differing reaction to the two
walkouts, Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO, said
``The GM strike began a local strike. The UPS strike was a national
strike from day one. We're seeing a calculated acceleration of the
GM strike. The issues surrounding the strike _ downsizing,
exporting America jobs _ are issues that workers face across the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   This is the ninth time in two years that an auto workers local
has struck General Motors _ a development that industry analysts
say shows that GM's labor relations team is less attuned than
Ford's and Chrysler's. As in the current strike, in many of the
previous walkouts, the showdown was over GM's desperate desire to
downsize, outsource and cut costs and the UAW's demand not only to
prevent layoffs and outsourcing, but to preserve job slots for the
workers of tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue here is not peculiar to General Motors,'' said
Daniel Kruger, professor of labor studies at Michigan State
University. ``It's shared by all large and small employers: how can
we find a balance between corporate efficiency and labor
stability.''

BUSH LEADS MAURO BY 53 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN TEXAS POLL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Public support for Democrat Garry Mauro has slipped
despite a monthlong television advertising campaign and he now
trails Republican Gov. George W. Bush by 53 percentage points, the
latest Texas Poll found.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 691 likely voters released Wednesday found Bush is
leading in his re-election race over Mauro by 70 percent to 17
percent, with 11 percent undecided and 2 percent wanting neither.
</P>
<P>
   The June 1-12 poll, conducted by Scripps Howard and the Office
of Survey Research at the University of Texas, has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's support dropped 4 percentage points from a Texas Poll
done earlier this year, when Bush led Mauro 67 percent to 21
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead in the current poll is exactly the same lead as he
held over Mauro when the Texas Poll was conducted in the summer of
1997. But that poll was done before Mauro officially announced for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also ran an estimated $600,000 in television commercials
this past month criticizing Bush for his 1995 veto of a bill that
would have guaranteed patients who belong to health maintenance
organizations the right to choose their own doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is leading overwhelmingly among Republican and independent
voters, and even 37 percent of the Democrats surveyed said they
would vote for Bush over Mauro, now the state's land commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro attacked the credibility of the Texas Poll, calling it
``laughable.'' Mauro said a Democratic poll conducted this week
shows him trailing by just 35 percentage points, with Bush leading
63 percent to 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am right on schedule for the plan I put in place,'' Mauro
said. ``I feel real good about where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   But with less than five months left to the election, no Democrat
has been in worse shape to win the governor's office since federal
troops occupied Texas during Reconstruction more than 150 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have lost governor's races just three times this
century: incumbents Ann Richards and Mark White in 1994 and 1986
respectively, and party nominee John Hill in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Richards was leading in the Texas Poll at this point in her
unsuccessful re-election campaign, while White cut a 14-point poll
deficit in half by the time he was defeated Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Hill held an 11 percentage point lead in a poll for Texas
Monthly magazine just before he lost the 1978 election to Bill
Clements, the first Republican to win the governor's office since
Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Even in her upset victory over Republican Clayton Williams in
1990, Richards trailed just 8 percentage points at this point of
her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the latest Texas Poll results made him happy because
it says Texans are responding favorably to his administration.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the poll found Bush's job approval rating to be 75
percent, the highest since he's been in office and the highest of
any governor polled since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said the poll results also will make him work harder
for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just says I better take nothing for granted,'' Bush said.
``I am concerned about my supporters and workers saying we don't
have to work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The high poll numbers could create a perception that Bush's
actual support had weakened if he were to win by a substantially
smaller margin in a low-turnout election. Such a change in
perception could weaken his potential as a Republican presidential
candidate in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Poll asked voters whether they would be more likely or
less likely to vote for Bush's re-election if he also were running
for president. Twenty-percent said it would make them more likely;
12 percent, less likely; and 65 percent said it would make no
difference in how they voted.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said the Texas Poll was unreliable because its sample was
31 percent Republican, 25 percent Democrat, 26 percent independent
and 18 percent who said other or don't know. Mauro said it is
``absurd'' to believe 18 percent of Texans believe they belong to a
third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Texas Poll is anything but laughable. It's
amateur hour at its worst,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also attacked the poll for saying it showed Democrats
losing in the races for lieutenant governor and comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Poll has John Sharp losing and Paul Hobby (trailing)
at double digits,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller Sharp is running for lieutenant governor.
Former Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby's son, Paul, is running for comptroller.
The Texas Poll results in those races will not be publicly
available until Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment William Larson heard the hesitant voice of his
investment banker on the telephone, he knew something had gone
awry. Cheyenne Software, a company he had been negotiating to buy
for several months, had spurned his advances and was treating his
$1 billion stock offer as a hostile takeover attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Larson was no amateur. He had snapped up four companies in less
than three years for the fledgling software empire he ran. But
Cheyenne was supposed to be the big catch. ``You have to hold a
press conference and respond,'' Larson's banker told him.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed in the spring 1996 battle, Larson
urged Cheyenne's chief executive to let an independent committee
consider the offer. Cheyenne, in turn, accused him of trying to
``poison the minds'' of its shareholders. Realizing he couldn't win
without paying too high a price, Larson withdrew his bid. Months
later, his archrival, Computer Associates, bought Cheyenne for
about $1.2 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the one that got away,'' Larson, 42, said recently over
lunch in his office in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Not many other catches have eluded his grasp since then. He has
continued buying companies and has transformed his company, Network
Associates _ which was previously named McAfee Associates _ from a
stodgy one-product shop into one of the largest independent
software suppliers in the country, with a market value of more than
$5.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to 1997, revenue quadrupled to $612 million, and the
company's stock price has multiplied 28-fold, to Wednesday's
closing price of $41.625 a share. And though Network Associates is
dwarfed by the likes of Cisco Systems and Lucent Technologies,
Larson is regarded as one of the most successful acquirers of
technology companies today.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheyenne fiasco taught him several important lessons, Larson
said, particularly that you should never put an offer in writing
unless you know the deal is done. ``I'm a quick learner, and I
don't make the same mistake twice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman and chief executive, his guiding principle is to
hang onto the core asset of the acquired company _ the brainpower
of its employees _ at all costs. That strategy requires precision
planning, involving everything from putting Network Associates
T-shirts on new employees' chairs to calling favored executives to
keep them from bolting to the competition.
</P>
<P>
   To strengthen the talent pool, Larson also wields a carrot and a
stick. The stick is a blunt warning to newcomers to get results or
go elsewhere. The carrot is stock options _ largesse that he
estimates has already made more than 200 millionaires among his
staff of about 1,700.
</P>
<P>
   Larson wants to be the dominant seller of software that helps
companies protect their computers from hackers and viruses as well
as manage their computer networks better. And he is well on his
way: His company has absorbed 12 companies in the last four and a
half years, ranging from the acquisition last week of a British
anti-virus software maker, Dr. Solomon's Group PLC, for $642
million in stock to the $1.3 billion acquisition in 1997 of Network
General Corp., a network-management company.
</P>
<P>
   Pursuing growth through acquisitions, a daunting task in any
industry, is an even greater challenge in a business where the key
to success or failure walks out the door each night. But Larson has
consistently exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Most people figured the takeover of Network General would put
the brakes on the company's earnings growth, which had averaged 40
percent a year since Larson joined the company.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in the quarter ended on March 31 _ the first since the
deal was completed _ earnings surged 14 percent over the previous
three-month period, higher than analysts had expected. Revenue rose
9 percent, to $188.4 million. That figure was 3 percent higher than
analysts' estimates of what the two concerns would have generated
had they remained independent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier acquisitions are also paying off. Between 1994 and 1996,
Larson paid $44 million for four small companies that have become
the mainstay of Network Associates' service-desk business. Analysts
say those acquisitions added as much as $75 million in revenue last
year and will contribute $100 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an accounting game,'' said Michael Murphy, editor
of the California Technology Stock Letter. ``He is acquiring pieces
of a product portfolio that get him taken more and more
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Larson can continue his winning streak.
After all, the market for antivirus products is maturing, giving
short sellers a reason to bet against his stock. In addition, as
his company grows, it will be harder to compete with cash-rich
giants like Microsoft Corp. for acquisitions to complement his
one-stop-shopping concept.
</P>
<P>
   Larson brushes off the skeptics with his usual swagger. ``We
don't lack for a direction,'' he said. ``What might be unclear is
the destination.'' Besides, he said, gazing out his window at
Silicon Valley below, ``If you swim with the sharks, you have to
learn to bite back.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about his acquisition strategy, Larson shifts
uncomfortably in his chair. He picks up his sandwich and puts it
down without a bite. He tugs at the shoulder of his too-snug shirt.
He laughs heartily, but with a nervous edge.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't surprising. ``The most dangerous point where you are
most at risk during a transaction is post-announcement and prior to
closing,'' he said. ``There is a significant amount of work that
goes on in the first three to six months when people are being
tested.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why Larson has an integration plan ready the day an
acquisition is announced, unlike many companies that keep people in
the dark for weeks. First, Network Associates and the target
company move quickly to reassure their employees by sending them
the news release announcing the takeover via e-mail, along with a
copy of a joint letter by the two chief executives and a
presentation touting the new partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Larson also sets up four to six ``tiger teams'' led by top-level
executives from both companies to combine sales, accounting and
other departments. To prevent a stampede out the door, he keeps a
crucial ``keepers'' list of employees that he or another highly
placed executive will personally ask to stay. ``Executive
recruiters divebomb your firm,'' he complained. ``And the best
people leave first.''

ufxx nypt &QL; 
 &UR; BC-LARSON-SOFTWARE-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; UNDATED: leave first.'' &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Network Associates acquired Network General last year,
Larson made several presentations, including one to 800 people in a
Santa Clara theme park that was broadcast to 10 other cities. ``If
you're scared, that's human,'' Larson said he told employees then.
``We are taking you out of your comfort zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly where he wants them. He lets employees know he
won't tolerate ``dead weight.'' ``Just show me the money,'' Larson
told sales representatives after merging with Network General.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no job is exempt, he says. ``Like, you know, public
relations,'' he whispered as his publicity director stepped out of
the room.
</P>
<P>
   If he can be harsh toward slackers, he can be even more
dismissive of rivals _ a trait that has earned him a fair share of
critics. For years, he has sparred with Gordon Eubanks Jr., chief
executive of Symantec Corp., a software maker and competitor, whose
company sued Network Associates in 1997 accusing it of selling
software to customers that contained stolen computer code. (The
suit is pending.) Larson responded with a $1 billion defamation
suit that was later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes out of his way to explain why competitors are
dumbbells,'' said Murphy of the California Technology Stock Letter.
``There are people in the Valley who'd like to see him take a
header just to give him a little humility.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while supporters and critics agree that he can be a brash
self-promoter, they say he is also a first-rate strategist. ``He's
not for everybody and everybody's not for him,'' said Edward J.
Zander, the chief operating officer of Sun Microsystems, who hired
Larson to work at Sun in the late 1980s. ``He's an aggressive guy
who says his piece.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Massachusetts, Larson started in business as a
consultant at Bain &AMP; Co., the management consulting company in
Boston. A graduate of Stanford Law School, he cut his teeth at
Apple Computer and Sun, where he held senior sales and marketing
jobs and learned how important it was to manage Wall Street's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   He is not your typical chief executive. He listens to Generation
X bands like Smashing Pumpkins and Third Eye Blind, eschewing older
singers like Billy Joel. And he sometimes wears a pair of Batman
cuff links to meetings, a gift from his son. Why? ``Because I'm
Batman!'' he said he once told a stock analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, he is ``obsessed with Network being a
multibillion-dollar company,'' said Charles Phillips, an enterprise
software analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. When Larson went
shopping for a new banker after the Cheyenne incident, he looked
for a brand name with clout on Wall Street and a revered analyst
willing to pay attention to his company. Morgan Stanley, one of the
premier investment banks involved in technology mergers and
acquisitions, delivered on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   Since he hired Morgan Stanley, few opportunities have slipped
by. Larson took two earlier passes at Dr. Solomon before the
company agreed to be bought last week. And when it seemed another
bidder was about to win Trusted Information Systems, a maker of
software to protect companies from Internet hackers based in
Glenwood, Md., he fought back with all his weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Larson first invited Stephen Walker, chief executive of Trusted
Information Systems, to dinner at the Park Avenue Cafe in New York
last December to propose a combination. The executives discussed
the prospects over the next two months, flying to each other's
headquarters, and set up what was supposed to be a final meeting on
a Friday in February to discuss price.
</P>
<P>
   But on the morning of the appointment, Larson got a call from a
representative of the company saying the meeting had been called
off. Platinum Technology, a competitor, had entered a bid and was
expected to win, he said he was told.
</P>
<P>
   Larson had other ideas. And he acted fast. After meeting with
his bankers, he called Walker that afternoon and said he was
willing to consider a stock exchange worth about $20 a share, well
above Platinum's bid of $15 a share. ``That's fine,'' Larson said
Walker replied. ``Are you offering that or not?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Larson said. ``I'm getting on an airplane to come and
see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Within hours, he and his negotiating team were in Washington. On
Saturday, they closed a $303 million stock deal with Walker. It was
approved by both boards the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Larson displays contradictory emotions about his future. He
worries about who will succeed him, but quickly adds that he has no
plans to leave. He suggests that he is the driving force behind the
company, then remarks that he is only as strong as his team. ``A
lot of this is force of sheer will, and stuff happens,'' he said.
``I should be able to get hit by a truck and not have the stock go
down 20 points.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that many in the industry wonder when the tables
will be turned on Network Associates. ``The one question I get is
who is going to buy him,'' said John Powers, an analyst at
BankAmerica Robertson Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   Larson laughed at that thought. And for a brief moment, he had
nothing to say.

AMA RETAINS LEADER DESPITE SUNBEAM FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Ore., Texas)  (mk) 
 By BILL DEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Delegates to the American Medical Association retained
their current leadership Wednesday, rejecting a presidential
candidate who was critical of a failed deal to allow the commercial
use of the AMA's name.
</P>
<P>
   The 484 delegates of the nation's largest organization of
physicians instead elected as their president Dr. Thomas Reardon, a
64-year-old general practitioner from Portland, Ore., who was
chairman of the AMA at the time of the contract, with the Sunbeam
Corp. Reardon is to begin his one-year term in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA backed out of the deal, and five executives left last
August, after the organization was criticized for endorsing home
health products that it had not tested. Sunbeam has sued the AMA,
seeking $20 million for breach of contract. The association would
have received millions in royalties for putting its logo on
humidifiers, blood-pressure monitors and other devices. The
association plans to approach Sunbeam to try to settle the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Reardon defeated Raymond Scalettar, a Washington rheumatologist
who campaigned against the AMA leadership's handling of the Sunbeam
contract and disputed an AMA committee's conclusion that the board
of trustees had not known of the deal. The medical association
would not release the election tally, but some delegates said they
believed that the vote was close.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the legal costs and loss of top staff members, the
Sunbeam incident damaged the credibility of the 290,000-member
association. For example, an Illinois delegation offered a
resolution saying the AMA was ``shamed by legitimate local and
national criticism of institutional conflicts of interest and
unacceptable commercialism.'' The convention has yet to vote on the
delegation's proposal to open the books on the cost of the Sunbeam
issue, and to open all meetings of the AMA trustees.
</P>
<P>
   After his victory, Reardon told reporters: ``We still have the
litigation to deal with, but I think emotionally we need to kind of
move on past Sunbeam. We have learned that we need to be more _
what is it they say at Nordstrom's? _ more responsive to our
customers, our members.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA is unlikely to endorse commercial products again, even
though the American Dental Association and similar organizations
have such deals, said the incoming president, Nancy Dickey, a
47-year-old family practitioner from College Station, Texas. ``It's
always possible to say you should have done something different or
better,'' Dickey said. ``I think the delegates generally see that
the money is not worth the difficulty of finding the right deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates also approved an all-out effort to allow consumers
to choose their health insurance from among competing plans, as
they now choose auto insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians have been unhappy with the current system for a
decade,'' said Dickey, the first woman to be the association's
president. ``Patients have been unhappy for five or six years. Now
even CEOs are unhappy because costs are rising again. If
everybody's unhappy with the existing system, what better time to
change it?''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Chicago Bulls celebrate their National
Basketball Association championship with victory cigars, the
delegates approved an emergency resolution on Tuesday calling on
professional athletes to avoid the use of cigars and other tobacco
products. After that resolution was approved on Tuesday, some
members of the Detroit Red Wings were seen on television
celebrating their National Hockey League championship with cigars.

 &HT;    Race for Cajun Electric Power narrows field to two
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A Southern Co. partnership and Enron Corp. have
emerged as finalists in bidding for Cajun Electric Power
Cooperative, a Louisiana electricity supplier that's been in
bankrupcy for three years.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Louisiana disqualified Louisiana-based
Southwestern Electric Power Co. from the bidding. U.S. District
Judge Frank Polozola has thrown out SWEPCO's $940 million bid and
found the company had tried to buy the support of seven rural
electric cooperatives for its takeover proposal. Polozola ordered
SWEPCO to repay $1 million to the co-ops and recommended a criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are planning to appeal,'' SWEPCO spokesman Peter Main said
Wednesday. But for now, the company is disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun supplies electricity to 12 rural cooperatives that serve
315,000 homes and businesses, about a quarter of Louisiana's
population. The utility was driven into bankrupcy in 1994 by its
failed investment in River Bend nuclear power plant in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-September, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Gerald Schiff is
expected to choose a winning bidder for Cajun's non-nuclear assets
after months of wrangling among the rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Generating, the consortium that includes Atlanta-based
Southern, Northern States Power of Minneapolis and Zeigler Coal
Holding of Fairview Heights, Ill., is bidding $1.18 billion for
Cajun, while Enron is bidding $932.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's down to the two of us,'' said Enron spokesman Mark
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   Tal Wright, spokesman for Southern, said Louisiana Generating
has submitted ``the best bid'' for Cajun. Palmer, however, said
Enron's proposal is the ``lowest cost offer'' because its rates
would be lower.
</P>
<P>
   Southern and Enron have emerged as prime competitors in electric
power and natural gas markets as the utility industry is
deregulated in the United States and U.S. companies seek footholds
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Southern's interest in Cajun is part of an effort to back up its
power marketing business with generating plants in selected U.S.
markets. The company last month agreed to purchase a network of
power plants in New England for $537 million.

 &HT;    Mood swings lift market investors
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Stocks soared Wednesday after the U.S. moved to prop
up the Japanese yen, but analysts warned it will be a temporary
rally unless it is followed by more permanent economic reform in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Investors experienced a ``mood swing'' to renewed confidence
about earnings following Monday's pessimism that Asia's crisis
would hurt U.S. profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important point is that there was a reason for the mood to
improve _ namely that the U.S. will not stand aside and let the yen
fall against the dollar,'' said Anthony O'Bryan, a market analyst
with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, investors will have to be persuaded that
``real, concrete developments'' are in the works to reform Japan's
economy if the rally is to last. Japan's recovery is needed so it
``can help the rest of Asia,'' O'Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Interstate/Johnson Lane,
said he doubts the new mood will last, given the market's high
share prices relative to earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the correction will resume. I'm inclined to think that
once the end-of-quarter window dressing is over and we get into
July earnings season, we still will have a very turbulent market,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Window dressing'' is the rush of trading late in a quarter by
institutional traders so they can report fully invested portfolios
to their clients.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, investors rallied behind the U.S. action
from the opening bell, sending the benchmark Dow Jones industrial
average up as much as 227 points in early trading _ just two days
after the benchmark index suffered its fifth worst one-day point
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Diminished anxiety about world conditions buoyed cyclical, or
growth-related, stocks such as chemicals, paper and heavy
equipment. This boosted the Dow and Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 indexes
1.9 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Computer stocks, which have been under selling pressure for
months, continued to rebound, as did smaller-capitalized stocks.
These rallies buoyed the technology-laden Nasdaq composite and
Russell 2000 indexes 1.3 percent each.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's atmosphere, investors paid scant attention to the
Federal Reserve's ``beige book'' report, which showed a
continuation of benign inflation against a backdrop of strong
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. move to prop up the yen may also minimize some of the
market's response to today's April trade report, which is expected
to show a deficit of $13.2 billion. The biggest casualty of
Wednesday's trading was the bond market, where heavy selling had
the effect of lifting 30-year Treasury yields from recent all-time
lows.

 &HT;    Cultural institutions' chiefs compare notes, aspirations
 &HT;    By Maria Saporta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- How can Atlanta reach the next level in artistic and
cultural offerings?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question directors of Atlanta's major museums and
cultural institutions tried to answer Wednesday at one of their
regular, informal lunches.
</P>
<P>
   Since early 1992, Atlanta's museum directors have been meeting
nearly once a month to exchange ideas, information and support.
Those meetings have helped eliminate any sense of competition or
isolation between and among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably originally met as a therapy group,'' said Terry
Maple, president of Zoo Atlanta. ``We were all struggling mightily
with our institutions that were in growth or rebirth. We found that
when we compared notes, there was a lot of common ground. We even
cross-fertilized by hiring each other's staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The museums and cultural institutions that are part of the group
include the High Museum of Atlanta, Zoo Atlanta, Fernbank Museum of
Natural History, SciTrek, the Children's Museum, the Atlanta
Botanical Garden, the Michael Carlos Museum and the Atlanta History
Center. Ann K. Bergstrom, director of cultural tourism for the
Atlanta Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, regularly attends to
contribute her perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, Atlanta is viewed a place where there's not much to
do. The existing cultural institutions have not become nationally
recognized attractions that draw tourists and conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the museums and institutions, which primarily are
located in the central city, are having trouble even attracting
people from the suburbs. It's a phenomenon Maple describes as
``inertia of the 'burbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's cultural attractions have enjoyed considerable
financial investment in the past decade. Just about every
institution has expanded and established solid financial results by
wiping out their debts and operating in the black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all agreed that the Olympics has raised the bar,''
said Pat Turner, director of the Children's Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, several institutions have not seen their
attendance grow, with the exception of Fernbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had record attendance in April and May,'' said Susan
Neugent, Fernbank's president. Fernbank has had quality exhibits
and IMAX movies in previous years, but Neugent said the difference
this year has been strong marketing.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story each institution repeated. They need corporate and
individual partners to keep their museums and attractions fresh
with new exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen Crider, SciTrek's director, said her attraction needs
businesses to display cutting-edge technology.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Rifkin, director of the High Museum, said his institution
has enjoyed support from both individuals and corporations. But he
said the Atlanta community still needs to better understand the
economic benefits of having strong arts and cultural institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an investment,'' Rifkin said.
</P>
<P>
   Change at United Way
</P>
<P>
   At its annual meeting Wednesday, the United Way of Metropolitan
Atlanta announced a change in its board structure to better serve
the community's social needs.
</P>
<P>
   W. Thomas Smith Jr., IBM's general manager of small and medium
business for North America, became United Way's new chairman,
succeeding Kent C. ``Oz'' Nelson, retired CEO of United Parcel
Service.
</P>
<P>
   Effective July 1, the United Way board will be streamlined from
62 members to 30. But it will have a 130-member leadership network
to focus on tasks and projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task at hand is to subordinate ourselves to the work to be
done,'' Smith said. Jack Guynn, president of the Atlanta Federal
Reserve Bank, will follow Smith as United Way's chairman next year.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, United Way has redirected its giving and
fund-raising to solving the biggest concerns in the Atlanta
community. United Way surveyed 40,000 Atlanta citizens, who said in
one clear voice they wanted stronger, safer communities. Since
then, United Way has directed most of its giving to four
categories: nurturing children and youth, strengthening families,
encouraging citizen involvement and increasing self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The 130 network members, including county advisory boards, will
focus on various projects. For example, Johnnetta B. Cole, retired
president of Spelman College, is leaving the board but will help
develop the new Johnnetta B. Cole Society, which recognizes those
contributing between $1,000 and $10,000 to United Way annually.

 &HT;    Alabama's James still a skillful political player
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOOVER, Ala. -- Tuesday's segment of ``Fob James Live'' was
broadcast from an ideal setting for Alabama's athlete-governor: the
announcer's booth at the Hoover Met, the suburban stadium where the
Birmingham Barons play minor league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   As he does weekly, James talked with callers from around the
state, pausing occasionally to describe the scene as the Barons
took batting practice on an emerald field under a clear summer sky.
With the loping efficiency of an outfielder handling routine fly
balls, the governor dealt with questions about unscrupulous bass
tournament organizers, wrongful terminations and child care for
mothers getting off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But the topic most on the mind of the former Auburn football
great was the radio ad with which his Republican primary opponent,
Montgomery businessman Winton Blount, is now blasting him. In so
many words the ad accuses the governor of lying, perjury and
self-aggrandizement, charges James referred to Tuesday as
``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he's hired some campaign gurus and they've got control
of his mind _ and his money, too,'' James told a caller.
</P>
<P>
   James said later he wasn't talking specifically about Tom Perdue
and Sonny Scott, the Atlanta consultants he hired last year to
streamline the governor's office. But the efficiency experts and
Blount's gurus are the same people. Perdue and Scott were dismissed
after what James characterized as ``a hell of a misunderstanding''
and are now running Blount's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to back up the perjury charge in the ad, Scott cited news
stories in which the foreman of a Montgomery jury said the jury's
first decision was to ``disregard (James') testimony'' in the trial
of a former agency head James had fired for theft.
</P>
<P>
   The self-aggrandizement charge relates to a family-owned
landfill the governor said nets only about $70 profit a month from
business with the state. Scott said the amount involved was
``inconsequential as to whether the governor lied, for lack of a
better word,'' about the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The runoff campaign has reached this bitter edge as the two
Republicans prepare for the first of four debates tonight in
Montgomery. James and Blount have pulled out all the stops,
courting black political leaders and winking at possible Democratic
crossovers.
</P>
<P>
   A good turnout by religious conservatives is critical for James.
Ralph Reed, James' campaign manager, told a group of preachers
Monday that Christian conservatives ``could make the difference''
and urged them to exercise their ``godly responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding that he's a millionaire like Blount, James has
also drawn from the Big Jim Folsom-George Wallace playbook to
attack Blount on class lines, calling attention to his family
wealth and endorsement by ``liberal'' newspapers. He characterizes
himself as a ``plain old conservative'' who can be trusted not to
raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   How effective the traditional class appeal will be in a
Republican primary remains to be seen, but an hour's worth of ``Fob
James Live'' is convincing evidence that despite all the bad press
he's received both in and out of state, the governor knows how to
connect with an Alabama audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't want me, if I was a college president, to keep a
football coach that couldn't win games, would you?'' he asked a
caller who criticized his dismissal of another department head.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Alabama you wouldn't.

 &HT;    Carson Inc. to purchase ethnic-oriented Johnson Products
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Carson Inc. said Wednesday it plans to buy Johnson
Products Co. from Miami-based IVX BioScience in a $70 million cash
deal that will combine two of the nation's major ethnic
personal-care products makers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's brands include Gentle Treatment, Ultra Sheen, Precise
and Afro Sheen. Its cosmetics are sold under the Posner name.
</P>
<P>
   IVX said Carson has agreed to pay an undisclosed amount for
additional cosmetics lines including Flori Roberts, Patti LaBelle
and Imani cosmetics brands and Dermablend. Under the agreement, IVX
has the right to sell these brands to a third party, but that will
not be determined until closing, IVX said.
</P>
<P>
   The Carson deal will allow IVX to focus solely on the
development, manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make Carson a pure ethnic personal-care
player,'' said Roy Keith, chairman of Savannah-based Carson.
``Johnson has lines that will naturally complement our existing
product line.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes on the heels of a management restructuring at
Carson during which Keith stepped down as CEO. Vincent A. Wasik,
associated with the partnership that is Carson's controlling
shareholder, was named interim CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Carson also said it planned to sell its Cutex nail care
business.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first acquisition in 1998 for Carson, which plans
major expansions in South America and Africa. Carson owns Dark &AMP;
Lovely, Excelle and Magic lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will increase their revenues and it will definitely
increase their market share,'' said Baunita Greer, an analyst with
Cromwell, Miller &AMP; Greer. ``This looks like a very positive
acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   It also puts Johnson back in the hands of a black-controlled
company. Both Keith and Carson President Joyce Roche are
African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Smikle, publisher of Chicago-based Target Market News, which
tracks ethnic markets, said ethnic personal products represent at
least a $2.2 billion market. Johnson, a pioneer in ethnic hair-care
products and once one of the nation's largest black businesses, was
sold to Ivax Corp., now known as IVX, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Carson's stock closed Wednesday at $7.25, down 25 cents. IVX's
stock rose 25 cents to $9.12 1/2.

 &HT;    Chinese native works with Carter Center to bring open elections
to thousands of villages
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- For six years in the 1980s, Yawei Liu worked as a
censor at a publishing house in his native China.
</P>
<P>
   His actual title was editor, not censor, but he had no illusions
about what his job really was. The publishing house looked for
American literature to translate into Chinese. And part of Liu's
task was to delete the passages referring to sex and politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were particularly tough to make sure that other people did
not have access to this information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This Saturday, Liu, now an assistant professor of history at
DeKalb College, departs for China on an entirely different mission:
to bring ideas to China rather than to suppress them.
</P>
<P>
   He's working on importing one concept in particular _ democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Liu is part of a four-man team from the Carter Center working in
concert with the Chinese government to bring fair, open elections
to the villages in which more than three-quarters of that nation's
1.2 billion people live.
</P>
<P>
   Unpublicized elections
</P>
<P>
   The team will be led by Bob Pastor, a Carter Center fellow. Also
making the trip will be Tom Crick, a Carter Center official, and
Qingshan Tan, an associate professor of political science at
Cleveland State University who is, like Liu, a Chinese citizen and
a former student of Pastor's at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   Elections have been mandatory in China's 930,000 villages since
1987, and Chinese officials have conducted elections since then,
said former President Jimmy Carter, ``in a totally unpublicized
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Carter added, ``They don't really know what goes on in
those elections in 930,000 villages, which is understandable. So
there they have asked us to help devise a computerized system to
receive reports of the results.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Pastor team observed some village elections, and
also reached a long-term agreement between the Chinese Ministry of
Civil Affairs and the Carter Center to establish a national data
collection system which will allow the ministry to learn the
results of elections quickly, and to determine if the elections
were fair.
</P>
<P>
   The team is making this particular trip to see to it that forms
devised to assess the fairness of elections _ by determining if
there was a secret ballot, if there was competition, and so forth _
have reached the villages and been understood by village officials.
They will also try to make sure that 14 computers and specially
designed software have reached the nine counties, three provincial
capitals and the ministry in Beijing (which gets two computers) so
a pilot project can be conducted. And they will assess how the
forms work, whether data is transmitted accurately to Beijing, and
whether the computerized data collection system, which Liu helped
design, can be used nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Communicating democracy
</P>
<P>
   Liu and Tan are critical to the team, Pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason these guys are so indispensable to the project is
their ability to interpret, in the broadest sense of the word,
between two cultures,'' Pastor said. They are adept at
communicating democratic concepts even in cases where Chinese may
not have a precisely equivalent word, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, who is associate director of the Carter Center's China
Village Elections Project, bridges the two cultures as well as
anyone can. He grew up in the city of Xian, in Shaanxi Province in
northwest China, the son of a career Chinese military officer.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he lives in Duluth and teaches American history.
</P>
<P>
   Liu, 38, grew up the beneficiary of the liberalization initiated
in China by Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
Whereas Liu at first learned his English from Chinese teachers,
eventually Australian teachers were admitted, and then Americans.
</P>
<P>
   American magazines and movies began to appear. And it dawned on
Liu that, contrary to everything he had been taught, the capitalist
system was not on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shocking revelation,'' he said. ``Talk about
disillusion.''
</P>
<P>
   When, after six years, he realized he was going nowhere in his
job as an editor/censor, his brother asked, ``Why don't you try
America?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Liu entered the University of Hawaii, where he earned a
master's degree in American history. Then he came to Emory, where,
in 1996, he earned his Ph.D. in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Now he leaves to carry back to China some of what he has learned
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in the project, from Carter to Pastor to Liu, say
Chinese officials most likely initiated village elections as a
safety valve, to avoid upheaval in the rural areas, whence all
China's revolutions have come.
</P>
<P>
   A duty as well as a right
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, Carter called China's initiation of
village elections ``a legitimate democratic achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it will be extended from the village level to the
county level, and then to the province level and then to the
national level is totally conjectural,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Liu said the task goes beyond teaching Chinese officials, who
have no experience with it, the ins and outs of democracy. He wants
to convince the Chinese people that democracy is a duty as well as
a right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your vote,'' he will emphasize, ``is not only secret but also
sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu felt hostility from some Chinese when he made the trip in
March, as if he were a sellout for working with Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He feels Chinese, though. He will not return there to live right
now, because he fears his 12-year-old daughter (he also has a 3
1/2-year-old girl) would have difficulty catching up with written
Chinese. But he has not sought American citizenship, either,
because that would mean renouncing his Chinese citizenship and
negating, he said, the first quarter-century of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He will continue working for democracy in China, he said, ``no
matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the children are grown, he and his wife will probably
turn their eyes East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thinking that, when we get old, we probably want to live
in China,'' he said.

SENATE KILLS HISTORIC TOBACCO LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate killed tobacco legislation Wednesday in
the face of a multimillion advertising campaign by cigarette
companies and numerous amendments tacked on by Republican leaders
who declared the bill too pricey and too big.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the legislation came a year after health
advocates, attorneys general from 41 states and cigarette companies
agreed to a more modest settlement to curb smoking among
teen-agers. But that settlement, which needed congressional
approval, was replaced by the much stronger legislation that the
tobacco industry refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly four weeks of debate on the bill that would boost
the price of cigarettes, raising at least $516 billion over 25
years, opponents used a two-vote knock-out punch to effectively
shelve the bill.
</P>
<P>
   First, by a vote of 57 to 42, supporters failed to win a motion
for cloture that would have ended debate and forced a vote on the
tobacco legislation. That effort needed 60 votes to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   In a second vote, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, raised a budgetary
point of order, saying the bill violated spending caps in the
five-year budget plan approved last summer. The Senate voted 53 to
46, falling shy of the 60 votes needed to wave the budget
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, who at first moved to shut
off debate, then declared he would cast his ballot against cloture,
signaling to fellow Republicans to kill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally had a vote for sanity,'' said Sen. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., a critic of the legislation from the start. ``This bill
was not salvageable.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the tobacco industry's advertising
campaign played a key role in the defeat and added that ``there
should be political consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the American people understand fully what's been going
on, they won't like what they see,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, R-Miss., said earlier that the bill had ``gone far, far,
afield'' from its original goal of curbing smoking among
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., who called the Senate bill
``a dead end,'' said Wednesday that House Republicans intend to
pass a simpler bill.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker said his ``highest priority,'' was to pass
``effective legislation that is narrowly focused on anti-teen
smoking, anti-drug efforts. Our goal is to reduce teen smoking, not
increase taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said after the vote that he, too, favored a narrower
version of tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we can convince Senate Democrats and the White
House to join us in that effort without again resorting to the big
government, big tax, big spending bill that was defeated today,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry spokesman Steve Duchesne declared victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the public wins because massive taxes and the black
market were voted down,'' Duchesne said.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry launched a media blitz to persuade
Americans _ and their representatives in Congress _ that the
tobacco bill would unfairly tax tobacco companies and would create
a black market in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past four weeks, Senate Republicans have loaded the
tobacco bill with amendments. The amendments included a measure to
beef up federal anti-drug trafficking efforts and to reduce the
so-called marriage tax penalty, the extra money some married
couples pay beyond what they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   The bill _ sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. _ would have
raised the price of a pack of cigarettes by at least $1.10 a pack,
expanded the federal government's ability to regulate tobacco
advertising and marketing and imposed financial penalties on
cigarette makers if they failed to reduce teen smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., who made an
emotional plea for a vote on the McCain plan, later angrily blamed
Republicans for killing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans chose to kill the bill today,'' Daschle said.
``Their fingerprints are on it ... People will die as a result of
this bill. That is a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   C. Everett Koop, the surgeon general in the Reagan
administration, said he was ``terribly disappointed'' in the Senate
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Senator Lott and his colleagues have done today is public
health malpractice, plain and simple ... I hope that the senators
who derailed the bill today lose sleep every night listening to the
sound of children taking their first puff and the sound of
emphysema and cancer patients gasping for their last breath.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., attributed the defeat to a core
group of people ``who came to the floor determined to kill the
bill'' and then mounted a ``concerted strategy,'' to doom it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a clear strategy that was in effect from day one, and
today they deliver the coup de gras.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a longtime crusader against
tobacco companies, decried the ``unholy alliance'' between
Republicans and cigarette makers and pledged to battle to revive
the tobacco bill by repeatedly including it as an amendment to
other measures.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime tobacco foe Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., said the
tobacco bill was killed by a ``sleight of hand and tricks designed
to fool the American people.''

U.S. SAYS RUSSIA WAS WARNED OF BALKAN MANEUVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Top NATO officials formally notified Russia about
Monday's aerial military exercises in the Balkans two days before
they took place, Western officials said Wednesday, although Russian
officials have complained they were left in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, created a political
tempest here on Monday when he publicly rebuked the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, for failing to give
Russia advance word of the exercises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a soldier and I value honesty in people most of all,''
Sergeyev told Shelton, who was visiting here. ``I do not understand
why they did this to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Western officials said Wednesday that on Saturday NATO twice
informed Russia about the exercises planned over Albania and
Macedonia as a show of power to intimidate the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic. Ethnic Albanians in Kosovo are seeking
independence from Serbia, and Milosevic's forces have been crushing
the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   First, the NATO secretary general, Javier Solana, informed
Russia's ambassador in Brussels, Belgium, Sergei Kislyak.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Naumann, the German general who heads NATO's military
committee, also called Lt. Gen. Victor Zavarzin, Russia's chief
military representative to NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be said with absolute clarity that the Russians were
left with no doubt on Saturday that the exercise would take place
on Monday morning,'' Naumann said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials were provided with a detailed account of plans
for the exercise, Naumann noted. They were told when it would begin
and that it would not exceed 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One view is that Sergeyev was simply posturing. In an effort to
persuade Serbian leaders to stop their crackdown in Kosovo, NATO
planned the air exercise for the eve of meetings in Moscow between
Russian officials and Milosevic. The meetings resulted in a joint
statement by Russia and Serbia in which Milosevic agreed to reopen
talks with Kosovo leaders, but refused to bend on the key demand
that he withdraw his forces from the province.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian defense minister may have been trying to distance
himself from the air exercise and inoculate himself against
criticism that he was cooperating too closely with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the exercise, Sergeyev expressed concerns about it.
But over the weekend Sergeyev sent a letter to Naumann, protesting
the timing and saying that it was the first step toward NATO
military intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Naumann sent a reply to the Russian Defense Ministry on Sunday
evening. In his response, Naumann denied that the exercise
necessarily presaged military action.
</P>
<P>
   Another interpretation of Sergeyev's response is that he was
genuinely surprised because the Russian officials in Brussels had
failed to pass on the notification quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no problem with NATO-Russia communications,'' said
one diplomat. ``But there may be a problem with Russia-Russia
communications. We have seen some signs that Foreign Ministry
officials do not always pass information on to the Defense
Ministry.''

BENEFICIAL BUGS BEAT CHEMICAL WARFARE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL NUCKOLS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who needs chemical warfare? Many garden centers carry beneficial
bugs that will fight your gardening battles for you.
</P>
<P>
   The most common soldiers are ladybugs, trichogramma wasps, green
lacewings, praying mantises and beneficial nematodes. And
earthworms, which don't eat pests but are good for the soil. Most
places don't keep lacewings and trichogrammas in stock because of
their short shelf life, but the stores will special-order them for
you. Here's a look at what these critters will do for you:
</P>
<P>
   Ladybugs: Ladybugs love to dine on aphids and other little bugs
such as thrips, mealybugs and spider mites. Aphids are those tiny
insects that suck the juices out of the tender new leaves on roses,
photinias, crape myrtles and other shrubs.
</P>
<P>
   Ladybugs come packaged in a mesh bag or a screen-top carton.
Refrigerated, they'll stay alive for several weeks, but you might
not know it, because they stop moving. At room temperature, you'll
see them crawling around in the container. They sell for
approximately $6 to $10 for 1,500 to 2,300 bugs.
</P>
<P>
   To put the ladybugs to work, water the plants where you want
them to linger, so they won't fly away in search of a drink.
Release them at the base of the plants at dusk or in the cool of
the morning. Repeat applications from mid-March through September.
</P>
<P>
   Trichogramma wasps: Don't confuse these garden helpers with
yellow jackets or other stinging wasps. They are gnatlike in size,
and they don't bother people. They do, however, lay their eggs
inside the eggs of such pests as cabbage worms, tomato horn worms
and corn ear worms. When the trichogrammas hatch, they feed on the
pests, killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Trichogramma eggs come on inch-square cards that look like
sandpaper, each holding up to 4,000 eggs. Some garden centers carry
the egg-coated cards; at others, you have to special-order them,
sometimes in multiples of two or three. They sell for approximately
$6 to $8 per square.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cards in the garden or attach them to a nearby tree.
Provide moisture to sustain the wasps.
</P>
<P>
   Green lacewings: These light-green, 3/4-inch insects are valued
for their gray-green larvae, sometimes known as aphid lions for
their voracious appetites for those pests. Mealybugs, spider mites,
thrips and insect eggs are other choice morsels.
</P>
<P>
   The microscopic eggs come in a brown paper sack, looking like
meal that you sprinkle on your plants. They have a short lifespan,
so they are special-ordered and delivered to your home.
</P>
<P>
   Lacewing eggs sell for approximately $13 to $15 per 1,000 or $25
per 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Praying mantises: Not every organic expert recommends these, as
they tend to gobble up every bug in sight _ including your prized
ladybugs and one another. If you don't fear for your other
beneficials, buy a foamy-looking brown cocoon and attach it to a
twig or leaf. A hundred or more praying mantises (up to several
hundred) will emerge.
</P>
<P>
   Praying mantis cocoons sell for approximately $4 to $8 each.
</P>
<P>
   Beneficial nematodes: These microscopic worms prey on the larvae
of such insects as fire ants, flies, fleas and grub worms.
Microscopic is right: A package that covers 8,000 square feet
contains 12 million nematodes. They look like a mealy substance.
Beneficial nematodes sell for approximately $20 to $25 for 7
million to 12 million nematodes.
</P>
<P>
   Soak them in water for 15 or 20 minutes, strain the liquid and
apply it to the yard with a watering can or a hose-end sprayer with
the screen removed. Keep the lawn moist for a month or so as the
creatures work themselves into the topsoil.
</P>
<P>
   Earthworms: The wiggly ones aerate the soil, allowing oxygen and
water to be absorbed by plant roots. They also enrich the soil with
their castings (droppings), adding minerals and nutrients that
plants need.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy either brown-nose manure worms or red wigglers; they
come in a bag, bucket or foam cup, along with some soil or compost.
Earthworms sell for as little as $2 a handful or $14 to $22 per
pound.
</P>
<P>
   Keep them moist until you release them. Some experts recommend
keeping them in the dark. Dig a foot-deep hole in the garden, add a
little compost or worm castings, and cover the worms with soil. Or
release them into your compost _ the outside of the pile, not the
inside, where the heat would bake them.

FRENCH TOWN CAN'T FORGET WORLD WAR II MASSACRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NOSSITER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORADOUR-SUR-GLANE, France _ At first it looks like hundreds of
other small towns lost in the French countryside, with its two
friendly cafes, its flower boxes and its proud little City Hall.
But the streets are straighter and the facades are cleaner, and
many buildings lie in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   All the town's past was taken away one bright June 10 more than
a half-century ago, when the SS came through. As part of a terror
campaign to cow the French Resistance, the SS machine-gunned the
men, herded women and children into the church and set it alight,
then burned the village down.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everybody in Oradour was killed, 642 people in all,
although it was never learned why Oradour had been chosen for the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   The burned remnants of that story, and of Oradour's history,
have loomed for 45 years over the reconstructed town. Old metal
sewing machines, bicycles, pots and pans, even cars, all
grotesquely twisted from the heat, still lie in fragmentary
buildings that gape at the sky. Charles de Gaulle himself called
Oradour ``the symbol of the country's suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   The state carefully preserved the crumbling walls, and everyone
here knows by heart the meaning of the number 14. That was how many
fellow Frenchmen, from Alsace, were later convicted for taking part
in the massacre, among 21 in all.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Germans forced 13 Alsatians to join the SS
and thus participate in the killings. For years townspeople who had
Alsatian visitors were scorned. The Strasbourg soccer team was
boycotted in nearby Limoges. Visiting Alsatians, if they did not
want their tires slashed, did best to keep a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Not last week. For the first time in 54 years an Alsatian walked
through the ruins of Oradour openly declaring his origins. The
mayor of Strasbourg, Roland Ries, was invited to take part in the
annual commemorative ceremonies of June 10. He laid a wreath at the
cemetery, spoke to a sister of victims and gave a modest speech at
the City Hall. ``Be assured that I am fully aware of your pain, and
so is everyone else in Alsace,'' Ries said.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people at the ceremony remembered the smell of burning
flesh when they entered the town, unawares, on June 11, 1944. It
lasted for months, said Camille Bardet, who lost his sister, a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The ruins themselves are still disturbing 54 years later.
</P>
<P>
   So some in Oradour talked only hesitantly about the ``beginning
of a reconciliation'' with Alsace, the easternmost French region,
like the former assistant mayor and town pharmacist, Henri
Cathalifaud. ``It's still a very sensitive question around here,''
Cathalifaud said. ``It took a long time for this town to come back
to life.''
</P>
<P>
   But others with good reason not to forget acknowledged that the
long passage of years had made old hatreds dusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we can't continue the war for 100 years,'' said Marcel
Darthout, who as a 19-year-old survived the massacre, one of six
men to do so, buried under a pile of bodies in a barn. ``It's got
to end. This should have happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Alsatians had asked Ries whether they could accompany him.
But he came virtually alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a half-century hasn't made the bitterness disappear,''
the mayor of Oradour, Raymond Frugier, said. ``I said it was
important to turn a page, but not to burn one's bridges.''
</P>
<P>
   He was all beaming smiles for Ries, though.
</P>
<P>
   Ries proposed the Oradour visit himself.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview he said, ``I said to myself, 54 years later, the
time had come for reconciliation, and to talk to each other, and
share the grief of the families.'' A woman who lost both her
parents in the massacre put it more frankly, as the Strasbourg
mayor left the ruined church. ``Look, 54 years later we haven't
forgotten anything,'' she said. ``But he seems fairly nice. So why
not?''

TOBACCO BILL DEATH IN SENATE MAY BURNISH MCCAIN'S IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.) (WIth CONGRESS-TOBACCO, CONGRESS-TOBACCO-ASSESS) 
(af) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The death of tobacco legislation in the Senate
Wednesday was a stinging disappointment for Sen. John S. McCain of
Arizona, yet it may burnish his image as a Republican maverick.
</P>
<P>
   The dictionary, after all, defines a political maverick as one
``who bolts at will and sets an independent course'' from his
party.
</P>
<P>
   That is what McCain did on tobacco, as he did earlier on the
campaign-finance issue, in which he teamed with a Democrat, Russell
D. Feingold of Nebraska, in a futile attempt to change the ways
politicians raise money.
</P>
<P>
   It is what admirers and critics alike expect him to do if, to
the surprise of no one, he runs for president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In an impassioned speech on the Senate floor Wednesday, just
before the final defeat of the tobacco bill he had pushed, he
insisted the vote was not about taxes (some Republican leaders
tarred the bill as an old-fashioned ``tax-and-spend'' package), but
``whether we're going to allow the death march of 418,000 Americans
a year who die early from tobacco-related disease and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was about ``whether we're going to have the will to
serve the public interest or the special interests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The senator said he had heard a lot of talk about how the
outcome would define the Republican Party. On that theme, he chose
words that could have come from the mouth of a liberal Democrat:
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be something to that. Because maybe we ought to
remember the obligations that we incur when we govern America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We might want to understand that our obligation first of all
is to those who can't care for themselves in this society, and that
includes our children,'' he went on. ``Isn't it our obligation _
shouldn't it define the Republican Party that we should do
everything we can to handle this scourge, this disease that is
rampant throughout young children in America? Doesn't that define
the Republican Party?''
</P>
<P>
   No, Republican leaders said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Their rejection of the tobacco legislation he had shepherded
through the committee that he heads was particularly bitter, given
the overwhelming support the committee gave it only two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has caused the change in attitude since we reported this
bill out by a 19-1 vote through the Senate Commerce Committee?''
McCain asked on the Senate floor as he sensed doom. ``I don't know.
I'll leave that to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the legislation, which would have raised the price of a pack
of cigarettes by $1.10 and allowed the government to regulate
tobacco advertising and impose penalties on the industry if smoking
by teen-agers did not decline sharply, goes back to committee
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the conservative but hard-to-pigeonhole Arizonan
chuckled during a telephone conversation about Speaker Newt
Gingrich's opposition to the McCain-sponsored tobacco legislation
just voted out of the Senate Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and other Republicans were calling the bill too tough
on the tobacco industry, or too liberal, McCain noted. But some
liberal Democrats, like Rep. Henry A. Waxman of California and Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, thought it too lenient, McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So maybe we're in the right place,'' the senator said
good-naturedly. Wednesday, that place was outside the party tent.

X-RAYS OF AIDS VIRUS SPUR DOUBTS ABOUT VACCINE, PROMPT OTHER
HOPES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mass.)  (ps) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists using a powerful X-ray technique have taken the first
snapshot of the contact made by the AIDS virus as it snares its two
target sites on the surface of a human cell. The pictures show the
intricacy of the virus' methods for dodging the human immune system
and confirm some researchers' view that the AIDS vaccine recently
approved for testing is unlikely to work.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the sight of the virus' defenses brings to
light certain weak points against which new drugs and perhaps
vaccines could be designed.
</P>
<P>
   The visualization of the virus' attack, a computer-generated
image based on X-ray data, is the fruit of eight year of work by
researchers at Columbia University and the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It depended on a technique powered by X-rays from the particle
accelerator at the Brookhaven National Laboratory on Long Island.
The results are being published in articles in this week's issues
of Nature and Science.
</P>
<P>
   The new work is important because it captures the critical
moment of infection when one of the probes that stud the surface of
the virus makes contact with the outer membrane of a target cell.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Baltimore, president of the California Institute of
Technology and chairman of a committee that advises the government
on AIDS research, described the finding as a landmark, arrived at
by ``great engineering and superb crystallography.''
</P>
<P>
   Although researchers understood the process of infection in a
general way, they can now see what happens with the precision of an
atom's eye view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between being blind and being sighted,''
said Dr. Joseph Sodroski, one of the authors of the new report.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can immediately visualize the conserved elements of the
protein, which make attractive targets for drugs or vaccines,'' he
said, referring to the regions of the probe that the virus does not
change by mutation.
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray pictures show that the probe latches on to one site,
then changes its shape to reveal another, previously hidden grapple
that snags the second site. Because the grapple is hidden until the
last moment, it is largely invisible to the body's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the virus' ability to evade immune detection,
the new pictures show, is that the surface of the initial probe is
itself swathed in sugar molecules, which the immune system does not
recognize as foreign since many of the body's own proteins are also
cloaked with sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray pictures of the viral probe are a long-sought prize
that have eluded detection hitherto. The features that make the
virus so changeable and barely visible to the immune system also
make it extremely hard to X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   These obstacles have now been overcome by making stripped-down
versions of the viral probe and the two sites it attacks. The
stripped down versions were synthesized by Sodroski and Dr. Richard
Wyatt and the Dana-Farber Institute. The X-ray analyses were made
by Dr. Wayne Hendrickson and Dr. Peter Kwong at Columbia
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very innovative and imaginative solution _ it will be
hard to find another AIDS paper this year that will have a bigger
impact,'' said Dr. John Moore, an AIDS researcher at Rockefeller
University in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Kim, an X-ray crystallographer at the Whitehead
Institute in Boston, said that many laboratories in industry and
universities had tried to crystallize the virus' probe protein.
``It's a testimony to their perseverance that they succeeded,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The X-ray pictures show the precise shape of the probe as it
interacts with its targets, two antenna-like projections from the
cell's surface that receive chemical signals from other cells. The
structures are known to researchers as the CD4 receptor and the
chemokine receptor.
</P>
<P>
   One notable feature seen in the new pictures is that part of the
CD4 receptor pokes into a large cavity inside the probe. ``When I
first saw that I said, `My God, that's the cure for AIDS,' '' said
Kwong, meaning that the cavity is an obvious target for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities for a vaccine seem less promising, however
because of the virus' two-target strategy. The real target, it
seems, is the chemokine receptor, but to decoy the immune system
the virus first latches on to the CD4 receptor. The first
interaction triggers the opening up of its grapple for the
chemokine receptor. Once it is open, the grapple is vulnerable to
immune attack but by this time it is already poised above its
target, giving the antibodies of the immune system little time or
space to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Devising a vaccine ``is certainly a long shot,'' Hendrickson
said, ``but the better we understand this culprit the more likely
it is that effective agents can be designed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the binding site for CD4 is a great plus because it
could give an idea of a site for an inhibitor of binding,''
Baltimore said, referring to the possibility of a drug to attack
the site.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists are skeptical that current candidate vaccines,
based on the probe protein, will be successful, a view they say is
confirmed by the new X-ray pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccines are based on the probe protein, known to scientists
as the gp120 subunit, and rely on the fact that the immune system
makes antibodies to it. But these antibodies ``play into the virus'
hands because they attack its defenses head-on,'' Moore writes in a
commentary in Nature on the new papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``One doesn't need the crystal structure to put a nail in that
coffin,'' Sodroski said of the gp120 vaccine. The virus, he noted,
``has evolved so as to evade immune responses and to make gp120 a
not very effective provoker of antibody responses, so it's not
surprising that gp120 is not the best vaccine out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Francis, the president of VaxGen, the company now
testing gp120, responded that tests in chimpanzees show the
vaccines protect the animals from very high doses of virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works in a chimp, it's safe in humans and it produces a
better immune response in humans than in chimps. To sit back and
wait for more lab tests would, I think, be unconscionable,''
Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   The work in Hendrickson's laboratory was funded by the Howard
Hughes Medical Institute in Bethesda, Md, which also spent $10
million on the device that collects powerful X-rays from the
Brookhaven accelerator. &QL;

   DRUGS-YOUTH _ WASHINGTON _ WASHINGTON - A 24-year-old undercover

her tumble into drug and alcohol use from the age of 9, using
``anything that I could get my hands on.'' And a pediatrician
recalled treating a 7-year-old girl, exposed to drugs and alcohol
before her birth, who tried to stab another second-grader at school
with a pencil. The experiences, relayed at a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing Wednesday, show the need for parents, educators
and legislators to reinstate the anti-drug campaigns that have
dwindled since the 1980s and shun the legalization of marijuana,
said Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug
Control Policy. (Abulhassan, Cox News Service). (Abulhassan, Cox

NYC PLANS DEFENSE AGAINST BIOCHEMICAL ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JUDITH MILLER and WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This city, long viewed as one of the world's most
vulnerable places to terrorist attack, has quietly undertaken an
ambitious effort to foil strikes with deadly germs or chemicals,
according to city officials.
</P>
<P>
   The city is building mobile emergency units, working out deals
with regional hospitals for emergency care, striking unusual
accords with drug companies to make medicines quickly in an
emergency and taking steps to stockpile medications, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The city's program is part of a federally supported effort to
enhance the nation's defenses against germ and chemical terrorism.
Last year, the federal government began training local officials to
deal with such attacks.
</P>
<P>
   New York's program, which is two years old and has already spent
millions of federal and local dollars, is considered is the
nation's most advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, New York is the capital of the world and as such
it's always viewed as the city that faces the greatest threat,''
said Jerome Hauer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management. ``While there is no known, immediate threat, we would
be irresponsible if we did not plan for one, even though the
likelihood of such an attack is small.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact of a germ or chemical weapons attack would be
devastating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the worries about germ and chemical attacks stem
from intelligence reports and incidents such as a religious cult's
assaults on Tokyo with nerve gas and germs.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the danger was dramatized in 1993 when a terrorist bomb
planted by Islamic militants exploded under the World Trade Center,
killing six people and injuring about 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has been a driving force behind New
York's heightened preparations, city officials said. His planned
$15 million crisis-control center, which has been the object of
jokes and ridicule, was described by these officials as a part of
the city's emerging defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the city began to monitor patterns of emergency
hospitalization so it can more quickly know if an attack with
unconventional weapons is underway. The mayor, officials say, has
asked to be personally informed of any suspicious outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   And the city plans to have the ventilation system of the crisis
bunker near the World Trade Center adopt a defensive strategy known
as positive pressure, experts say. This precaution keeps a gentle
breeze blowing outward whenever a door or window is opened,
automatically keeping away dangerous germs or chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is sponsoring a series of meetings in
which officials from New York and other cities play out what would
happen if the city were attacked with biological weapons. From
these exercises, federal officials plan to glean lessons which are
meant to be applied nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials supervising the congressional program that
last year provided about $100 million to support the training of
local officials to cope with unconventional terrorist attacks said
that only about a third of the 120 cities that are supposed to
receive such training and equipment have received assistance so
far. Indianapolis, for one, among the first medium-sized cities to
receive training, still has not received any equipment to combat
germ or chemical threats, said Phillip Roberts, the deputy director
of Indiana's Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   And while Los Angeles, San Francisco, Denver, and Atlanta have
set aside state and local funds to bolster such preparedness, he
added, about half the states were so short of funds that they and
their cities had to rely totally on federal assistance to train
``first responders,'' the state and local police, firemen, doctors
and emergency planning officials who would be first on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Hauer would laugh at the $150,000 that our office will
request in our next two-year budget,'' Roberts said. ``There's no
city in the U.S. that's better prepared than New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, city officials said they are torn between taking
credit for defensive preparations and panicking the public with
some of doomsday scenarios that, in recent attack studies and
simulations, have easily overwhelmed the city's existing defenses.
Experts agree that skillful terrorists could injure or kill
thousands if not millions of people, but disagree on the likelihood
of successful attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The city's defenses are being organized by Hauer's Office of
Emergency Management, which was created two years ago by the mayor.
Hauer is also a member of a small group of scientists and public
health officials who have been advising President Clinton on germ
warfare and civil defense.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say New York has received numerous threats over
the years, which have turned out to be hoaxes. Among the most
worrisome, and one of the few discussed publicly, was the discovery
in a basement in Queens in March 1997 of a canister marked
``sarin,'' a lethal nerve gas. Though the substance turned out to
be harmless, the incident led Giuliani to intensify efforts to
protect the city.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hauer and other local officials have declined to be
specific about the city's preparations, some of the steps being
taken and their motivation were outlined Tuesday by a deputy,
William Nagle, at a conference in Washington on biological
preparedness that was sponsored by the Potomac Institute for Policy
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Nagle said the city had already negotiated memoranda of
understanding with several counties surrounding New York to give
the city access to their hospitals and medical gear in an emergency
and was close to an agreement with at least one drug company to
provide ``surge'' capacity for the city in antibiotics. A list of
drugs that may be stockpiled at the city's hospitals was now being
drawn up.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Nagle told the 50 experts at the conference, is
``education, education, education.''
</P>
<P>
   He said since September, some 4000 members of the city's police
and fire units had undergone military schooling in how to deal with
germ and chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors and nurses are all trained to run in and help,''
Nagle, deputy director of emergency planning, told the meeting.
``If they do that with a bio or chem incident, they're going to
lose it.''

   Wednesday, Hauer said the city has also spent over $1 million to
buy 12 mobile emergency trailers filled with containment vessels of
different sizes that can isolate dangerous germs or chemicals, as
well as equipment to respond to an attack.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it has bought several hundred portable detectors
to help identify the exact nature of an infectious strike within as
little as 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One type is as small as a matchbook; the other, known as an
immunoassay, is a boxy gadget that uses an antibody to detect the
presence of a dangerous germ. New York is the first city to acquire
the latter, Hauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the least-known measures are plans to place the new
command center near the twin towers of the World Trade Center to
positive pressure, an idea being promoted by William Patrick, a
leading germ terrorism expert who helped run the nation's offensive
germ program before President Richard M. Nixon ended it.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are very impressive,'' Patrick said of the city's
emergency response team in an interview. ``They're quick learners,
take-charge kinds of people. They're first-rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The $15 million crisis center, city officials point out, is far
less elaborate and expensive than one already built in Tokyo, which
cost an estimated $190 million.
</P>
<P>
   Decades ago, the military began to study the city's potential
vulnerability to unconventional strikes. Among other things, it
tossed light bulbs filled with harmless bacteria onto subways
tracks as trains entered stations to see if the microbes spread,
which they did _ widely.
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt by New York and federal officials to play out
a germ attack demonstrated the city's vulnerability to terrorist
attack, officials disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, April 15, more than 50 scientists, government
officials and state and local emergency preparedness teams met in
secret on the outskirts of Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   They were confronted with a chilling scenario: More than 1,000
people in a 15-story office building in midtown Manhattan were
attacked by a germ disseminated through the unfiltered air ducts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the script, the spray contained tularemia, a highly
infectious germ that causes chills, fever, muscle aches, fatigue,
pneumonia-like symptoms and can be fatal. The germs spread quickly
throughout the building, whose windows were sealed, as they are in
so many modern buildings. Within 15 minutes, virtually the entire
building was infected.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, 80 people were ill. Some stayed home the next day;
others called their doctors. By Saturday, 450 more were sick; some
showed up at hospital emergency rooms. By Sunday another 550 were
sick. Only then did alarm spread through New York's medical
community.
</P>
<P>
   As the exercise unfolded, the experts discovered how unprepared
they are for such an event in New York City, despite the training
of ``first responders,'' police, firemen, emergency medical teams,
and others who would initially be called upon to cope with a germ
attack on New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the war game, officials said, by the time doctors diagnosed
the mysterious illness as tularemia and began prescribing proper
antibiotics, the epidemic had run its course. Because the
hypothetical terrorist had chosen a germ that causes a disease with
a 35 percent mortality rate, only a third of the 1,080 people who
fell ill died.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city's detectives were really good; so were the firemen.
The mayor's office was extremely impressive, very professional,''
said a federal official who attended the meeting. ``They were great
at controlling crowds and cordoning off areas; they did all the
right things. But still we got the maximum amount of lethality from
the maximum number of infections from the tularemia terrorist
attack. The scenario utterly defeated them.''

ANALYSIS: KILLING TOBACCO BILL IS POLITICAL GAMBLE FOR GOP
</HEADLINE>
   (With CONGRESS-TOBACCO) 
(sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a day of high risks on the volatile issue of
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   In killing anti-smoking legislation on Wednesday, Senate
Republicans took a leap of faith, trusting that the tobacco
industry's $40 million advertising campaign has so changed public
sentiment on the issue that there will be no election-year
ramifications from their vote.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry took a huge gamble as well _ that the
cascade of lawsuits it hoped to curb with the original settlement a
year ago will not bankrupt it. Those risks may be worse now than
they were then. Today, cases brought by individuals can be
buttressed by hundreds of damaging industry documents recently
disclosed as part of the settlement process in lawsuits brought by
states.
</P>
<P>
   The risks were emphasized as Democrats immediately vowed to
paint the Republicans as the tools of Big Tobacco in the fall
campaigns. That debate might again change the public mood on
tobacco and could cost the Republicans seats in the Senate, where
they can spare a few losses and still retain control, and the
House, where they have no room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton himself provided a preview of the campaign
themes when he made a final appeal to the Senate to ``protect the
children and not the tobacco lobby.'' Asked after the Senate killed
the legislation if there would be a political price to pay, he
said, ``I certainly hope there will be and there should be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who had been one of the measure's
fiercest opponents insisted that ``the bottom line is the bill
never had any real support from the American people.'' And Sen.
John McCain, R-Ariz., who drafted the bill, acknowledged that more
and more Republicans had come to believe that the anti-tobacco
issue does not have the broad public support they once feared.
</P>
<P>
   He even said that some of the members of the Commerce Committee
who had sent the measure to the Senate floor on an overwhelming
19-1 vote now opposed the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It was a turnaround in sentiment reminiscent of Clinton's defeat
in his effort to pass comprehensive health care legislation in
1994. And like the industry battle against health care, it was
partly brought about by a television ad campaign that portrayed the
legislation as a massive tax increase to pay for Big Government.
``When people call in, they parrot the ads,'' said McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago the mood was quite different. The prospect of a
comprehensive tobacco settlement seemed something historic that
would change forever the ways cigarettes are marketed in the United
States and alter the nation's public health and regulatory
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   In a deal hammered out by the tobacco industry and state
attorneys general, the tobacco industry would pay states $368.5
billion over 25 years for anti-smoking programs and to compensate
for the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. In return the
companies would have got protection from a wave of court cases
against them.
</P>
<P>
   But that pact turned out to have a Perils of Pauline existence _
in large part because of the impression that after decades of
political dominance, Big Tobacco was on the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   By last fall anti-smoking advocates like David Kessler, the
former commissioner of food and drugs, and C. Everett Koop, the
former surgeon general, had seized the public stage to push for
even tougher legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to endorse the proposed settlement in its
entirety even though his close adviser Bruce Lindsey had been
intimately involved in the negotiations that produced the proposal.
Instead, he described the basic principles he would like to see in
any tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the president made clear in his budget proposal this year
that he was counting that the settlement would be endorsed by
Congress. He proposed that $65.5 billion in appealing new programs
for child care, education and health be financed by some of the
revenues generated by a tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain and his Commerce Committee took up the effort to
draft a bill this winter, the political tide seemed to be running
strongly against the tobacco industry and Republicans were also
running scared. They had watched Bob Dole, their presidential
nominee, make the mistake during the 1996 campaign of questioning
whether smoking was addictive as Clinton posed as the defender of
the nation's children. They said they were not going to make that
kind of error in judgment again.
</P>
<P>
   And so after a marathon series of meetings and negotiations, the
committee produced a measure even tougher on tobacco than the
original settlement had been. It would cost the companies $516
billion over 25 years, increase penalties if teen-age smoking did
not drop and provide far fewer of the legal protections that the
industry had counted on.
</P>
<P>
   At that point tobacco walked out and vowed to fight the
legislation. Some predicted the defiance would boomerang and hurt
the industry further.

IN NASCAR, THE TRUTH SOMETIMES COMES SLIGHTLY PADDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a weekly basis, no TV series fuels more conspiracy theories
than The X-Files. But recent on-track events suggest that NASCAR's
Winston Cup Series, another TV ratings smash, is creeping up on the
paranormal/paranoia scale.
</P>
<P>
   If the truth is out there, it certainly has been difficult to
discern during the past two Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin's series-leading fourth victory in the Miller Lite
400 on Sunday somewhat was clouded by what kindly has been termed a
``questionable'' caution flag thrown to clear debris from the
Michigan Speedway in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   That caution _ the first of two in the race _ waved on lap 118
after Jeff Gordon had built a lead of nearly 10 seconds over
Martin. Gordon, the reigning Winston Cup champion, had lapped all
but 11 cars in the 43-car field.
</P>
<P>
   First reported as a piece of tailpipe from Sterling Marlin's
Chevrolet, the debris later was classified as a chunk of roll bar
padding that might have been thrown from one of the cars.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a highly paid, professional race-car driver
intentionally toss something onto the track? To artificially create
a yellow flag period, one that would keep himself and everyone else
on the lead lap from going a lap down to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw people throwing things out the window right before the
caution came out,'' said Gordon, who remained in the lead after
pitting during the ``questionable'' caution and after a four-car
crash on lap 125 prompted the final yellow. But Martin was
relentless, passing Gordon on lap 150 and taking the lead for good
on lap 182.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson, NASCAR's Winston Cup director, said that a review
of videotapes and the ``evidence'' was inconclusive, as far as how
the debris got onto the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we consider the situation suspicious, there is no
conclusive evidence as to how it occurred,'' Nelson said.
``NASCAR's view of a caution flag is to warn drivers of potential
hazards. Obviously, roll bar padding is not a hazard, but we don't
know that until we go and pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin declined to pass judgment on NASCAR for the call. But he
noted that he and his driving brethren are ``only human.'' And the
humans driving stock cars have been known to fudge the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-File'' that under Driver Denies Knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the judgment of NASCAR officials openly was
questioned during the closing laps of the Pontiac Excitement 400 at
Richmond (Va.) International Raceway on June 6. The decision was
made to red-flag and stop the nighttime race with seven laps
remaining, rather than clean debris from a messy wreck under
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Cup star Dale Jarrett, who was leading the race at the stoppage,
felt the decision not to click off laps under yellow ultimately
cost him the victory to Terry Labonte. Jarrett said the call to
red-flag went against NASCAR protocol. Mike Helton, NASCAR's vice
president for competition, said the sanctioning body merely was
trying to give the paying fans as many green flag laps as possible.
</P>
<P>
   A noble gesture, for sure. But the conspiracy theorists pointed
out that maybe this red-flag was not a coincidence. That perhaps
with a prime-time TV audience tuned-in and turned-on _ and a live
Indy Racing League event at Texas Motor Speedway playing on another
network _ that NASCAR stretched its rules for the good of the fans.
</P>
<P>
   And the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   And tough luck, Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the situation suspicious? You can look at it in two
ways.
</P>
<P>
   As Fox Mulder once said, the truth is out there.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Bart Simpson once said, nothing is out there. &QL;

   Pro Stock driver Bruce Allen of Arlington is ninth in the
National Hot Rod Association standings with 356 points _ a
remarkable statistic considering he has failed to qualify for four
of 10 events. Allen's latest DNQ was during the Pontiac Excitement
Nationals in Kirkersville, Ohio, on Saturday. Allen stood 16th on
the ladder after Friday's sessions, but he and the Outlaw Fuel
Additives Pontiac Firebird fell victim to tire shake on both
Saturday passes down National Trail Raceway. ``We had to change
some clutch discs Saturday, and it looks like it may have been a
defective batch of discs,'' said David Reher, who is partners in
the car with Allen and Buddy Morrison. ``I think that's what bit
us, because we were fine Friday night.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Pro Stock points leader Warren Johnson reportedly is a few weeks
away from unveiling his latest innovation _ a purpose-built,
clutchless 5-speed transmission. ``We started with a clean sheet of
paper and designed the new transmission from scratch,'' said
Johnson, a three-time champion and the acknowledged Professor of
Pro Stock. ``Most drag-racing gearboxes are basically updates of
30-year-old designs. We've simplified the gear-changing mechanism
and built the transmission to withstand higher torque loads. We've
even added a handle so you can carry the transmission like a
suitcase.'' Reher said he is aware of the project, which is being
engineered by specialist Leonard Long. ``Leonard has made some
refinements to a transmission that began as the Doug Nash
5-speed,'' said Reher, who estimated that perhaps 95 percent of
NHRA Pro Stock teams compete with the clutchless Liberty
transmission built by Craig Liberty. ``I don't think Warren's (new)
transmission will have any effect on his car at all. It may be
handier for changing gear ratios and as far as reliability. But
unless there's something I know nothing about, I don't see any
performance advantage.'' ...

   Kenny Bernstein is on a two-race winning streak in Top Fuel
after having knocked off Bob Vandergriff Jr. at Columbus. It marked
the first time since 1991 that Bernstein, driver of the Budweiser
King Dragster, has posted consecutive victories. &QL;

<P>
   Mark Martin not only is NASCAR's hottest driver, he also is one
of the sport's top talent scouts. On many occasions, Martin has
said that Roush Racing teammate Jeff Burton is the best current
driver in Winston Cup _ period. Martin holds similar regards for
another protege, and a driver who could be his clone. ``Matt
Kenseth is a superstar in the making,'' Martin said of the driver
who won the pole and the Lycos.com 250 Busch Grand National race at
Pikes Peak International Raceway last weekend. Kenseth, who scored
his second series victory, also moved past Mike McLaughlin into
first place in the BGN championship chase by 73 points. ``Matt has
what it takes. I believed in that for over a year now,'' Martin
said. ``If somebody said to me, `Why don't you create from scratch
the ultimate race-car driver,' he's the one. The sport is hungry
for new talent, and he's it.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Cup team owner Bill Davis said the management of MBNA has
informed him it will not return as primary sponsor of the No. 22
Pontiac Grand Prix driven by Ward Burton next season. ... Circuit
City has announced that it no longer will sponsor the No. 8 Stavola
Brothers Chevrolet this season. The team plans to take a few weeks
off before reportedly returning to the series. ...
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup regular Bobby Hamilton will pull double duty at
Pocono Raceway this weekend. In addition to driving the No. 4 Kodak
Chevy fielded by Morgan-McClure Motorsports, he also will serve as
crew chief on the Automobile Racing Club of America Pontiac Grand
Prix driven by his 20-year-old son, Bobby Jr. &QL; 
IRL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Stewart continues to shatter speed records on the Pep Boys
Indy Racing League tour. Stewart recorded a lap at 183.299 mph
Tuesday during open testing for the Pep Boys 400K at the 1-mile
Dover Downs International Speedway in Delaware. Unofficially, it is
the fastest speed recorded on the concrete oval featuring 24-degree
banked turns _ 27.401 mph faster than the NASCAR Winston Cup record
of 155.898 mph set by Rusty Wallace in May. ``We worked hard on the
chassis to get the car to go through the bumps really well, and
that was the secret,'' said Stewart, who drove the No. 32 Johns
Manville-Menards Special G Force/Aurora normally assigned to
teammate Robbie Buhl. ``I think the key to winning this race will
be who has the best motor, because everybody can run flat-out
here.'' The race is scheduled for July 19. Stewart won the pole for
the True Value 500K at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth with a
record qualifying lap at 224.448 mph, and then cracked off a lap of
228.012 mph during the night race June 6. ... Larry Curry, manager
of Team Menard, is leaning toward the G Force chassis at Dover. The
team competed with Dallara chassis at the Indy 500 and TMS. ``We
won the race at the 1-mile Orlando track with a G Force and
finished second with it at Phoenix, which is also a mile,'' Curry
said. ``We have a lot more data on the G Force at 1-mile tracks.'' &QL;

   Tomorrow marks the 50th anniversary of the first NASCAR
``strictly stock'' race, the forerunner of the series that evolved
into Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Transplanted Texan Jim Roper, the winner of that 200-lap event
at the three-quarter-mile dirt Charlotte (N.C.) Speedway, plans to
reminisce on his horse ranch in Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, not all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I work every day,'' said Roper, who raises thoroughbred
horses. ``I'll be 82 in August and I feel as good as I can be for
my age. Hope I'm here for several more years. There's always
something to do here. I haven't been on a horse for 10 or 15 years,
but you have to walk the horses, feed and water and clean up after
'em. You can stay pretty busy. I get great satisfaction out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Racing a Lincoln he had driven from Kansas, Roper originally
finished second at Charlotte to Glenn Dunnaway. But Dunnaway and
the 1947 Ford he was hired to drive were disqualified when a
post-race inspection found that the car's rear springs had been
modified with a wedge _ a device commonly used in ``whiskey cars''
run by moonshiners of the era.
</P>
<P>
   Roper said that with all due respect to NASCAR founder Bill
France Sr., he scored the race himself from inside the car, using a
counter out of a slot machine. When the race was over, he put the
upholstery back into the car, changed tires and wheels and took it
to an auction _ a clean, one-owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first stock-car adventure,'' said Roper, who said
he ran in two of eight NASCAR events in '49 before concentrating on
open-wheel cars. ``It's still the best one (victory) I ever had.'' &QL;

SUPERMAN FINDS HIS INNER STRENGTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN

<P>
   ``Still Me'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An autobiography by Christopher Reeve &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Random House &QL;
</P>
<P>
   $25 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not a knock on ``Still Me'' to say it was inevitable that
Christopher Reeve would publish an autobiography after the 1995
riding accident that left him a quadriplegic. Before the accident,
Reeve was best known for playing Superman. Now he is another sort
of icon, one whi is real and not pretend.
</P>
<P>
   If Reeve has paid a horrible price for his new style of
celebrity, he is determined to use this notoriety on behalf of
``everyone whose life has been touched by disability,'' to quote
from ``Still Me's'' dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Although his acting was sometimes wooden, Reeve proves with his
book that he is a genuine intellect. Produced without the
assistance of a ghost writer, ``Still Me'' is a moving, honestly
told tale that never descends into self-pity.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve begins his memoir with an idea for a movie he came up with
a few months after his accident. The plot is deceptively simple: a
quadriplegic who once loved to sail gradually loses himself in
shipboard fantasy until he is ready to abandon his waking,
physically challenged life for the dreams he hopes come with death.
At the last minute, he realizes that the love and support of his
family mean more than escape, and he accepts his physical
limitations instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think: This can't be my life, there's been a mistake,''
Reeve writes. ``It took a lot of adjustment. It still does.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Reeve uses about half his book to recount his
pre-accident life and career, ``Still Me's'' real impact comes from
his description of the accident and his life since.
</P>
<P>
   He is brave enough to leave nothing out _ we learn how his
underpants are changed and follow the tortured process he endures
to achieve bowel movements _ and honest enough to admit that the
resulting loss of dignity continues to bother him.
</P>
<P>
   Most poignant are Reeve's descriptions of frustration with his
family _ not out of any lack of love, but with his inability to put
his arms around them and hug back.
</P>
<P>
   His son Will is now 5 1/2, and ``I haven't been able to give
(him) a hug since he was 2 years old.'' To compensate, father and
son romp outside, Will on his bike and Reeve in a special motorized
wheelchair. Will always wins those races, and Dad is a good-sport
loser. Other times, Will plays indoor hockey games, and Dad
pretends that he and his wheelchair are the ice-smoothing Zamboni.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve, of course, has some proselytizing to do. He wants more
government funding for spinal injury research; he has founded the
Christopher Reeve Foundation to support quality-of-life programs
for people with all kinds of disabilities. (The prominently
mentioned address for those who would like to contribute is Box
277, FDR Station, New York, NY 10150-0277.) Reeve also hopes to be
among the first volunteers in scheduled experiments at attempting
nerve regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   We could be trite and conclude that Reeve turned out to be
Superman in real life, but ``Still Me'' engenders enough respect
for the author to eschew flowery tributes.
</P>
<P>
   Reeve crippled his spine, not his heart. ``Still Me'' ought to
be required reading for anyone who feels sorry for himself.

TOP ANTI-DRUG OFFICIAL ATTACKS CRITICS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Va., Calif.)   (dc) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House's top drug-policy official accused
critics of the United States' zero-tolerance drug laws Wednesday of
pursuing an agenda to legalize drugs, from marijuana to heroin and
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In written testimony before the Senate foreign relations
committee, the official, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, charged, ``There is
a carefully camouflaged, exorbitantly funded, well-heeled elitist
group whose ultimate goal is to legalize drug use in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCaffrey named no names, he was clearly referring to a
coalition of advocacy groups little known to the public that argues
the global war on drugs has cost society more than drug abuse
itself. Some of those advocates attracted attention last week with
an open letter to the U.N. secretary-general as the General
Assembly opened a three-day special session on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, whose 500 signers included the former U.N.
secretary-general, Javier Perez de Cuellar, former Secretary of
State George Shultz and two former senators, Alan Cranston and
Claiborne Pell, argued that by focusing on punishing drug users,
the United States and other countries had helped create a worldwide
criminal black market that had wrecked national economies and
democratic governments.
</P>
<P>
   The letter's signers also included George Soros, the billionaire
investor and philanthropist, who has spent as much as $20 million
supporting research and advocacy groups working to change
Americans' views on how to deal with drug use. Soros, who signed
the open letter, said in an interview last week that he hoped that
it would foster an open discussion of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey, the administration's director of national drug
policy, said the critics were disguising their true purpose because
Americans overwhelmingly oppose legalizing drugs. ``Through a slick
misinformation campaign,'' he said, ``these individuals perpetuate
a fraud on the American people, a fraud so devious that even some
of the nation's most respectable newspapers and sophisticated media
are capable of echoing their falsehoods.''
</P>
<P>
   His assertion prompted the judiciary committee's ranking
Democrat, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, to propose hearings into
the issue of legalizing drugs. ``Let's expose it for the fraud that
it is,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Soros could not be reached Wednesday because he is traveling in
Sweden. But one of the most prominent advocates of less punitive
approaches to drug use, Ethan Nadelmann, director of the Lindesmith
Center, a drug-policy institute in New York supported by Soros,
called the general's criticism ``an attempt to smear what's a very
responsible approach to dealing with drug abuse in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the disagreement is the concept of harm
reduction, which to advocates like Nadelmann, means finding ways
short of abstinence to reduce the harm that drug abusers cause
themselves and society. Needle exchange, in which addicts are given
clean needles to try to stem the spread of AIDS, is a prominent
example.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Zeese, president of Common Sense for Drug Policy, a group
in Falls Church, Va., that also wants drug laws changed, said,
``The reason why there is an upsurge of people advocating reform is
because the current policy is not making for a safer or healthier
society,''
</P>
<P>
   But McCaffrey called harm reduction ``a hijacked concept that
has become a euphemism for drug legalization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a cover story for people who would lower the
barriers to drug use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann responded, ``The majority of harm-reduction advocates
oppose drug legalization, and that includes George Soros.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Wednesday, the retired four-star general had ignored the
drug-reform lobby, so his sharp attack marked a change in strategy.
</P>
<P>
   After his testimony, McCaffrey said he was suggesting a debate
about legalization, not a witch hunt. ``It's a legitimate subject
of debate in our society if you do it openly,'' he said. He
predicted that the notion would be ``rejected resoundingly'' once
Americans discovered what was involved.
</P>
<P>
   Nadelmann said: ``I would welcome the opportunity to debate him
anytime or anyplace. His trying to equate all forms of harm
reduction with a free-market approach to drug legalization is both
false and duplicitous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Kleiman, a professor of public policy at the University
of California at Los Angeles who follows drug issues, expressed
concern that such a debate would detract from the more crucial task
of finding ways to make the current anti-drug strategies work more
effectively.

 &HT;    Fire forces many to leave home
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALDO, Fla. _ After two weeks of oven-dry heat, it finally
rained Wednesday _ a mist of white and black ash that fell from an
eerily dark midday sky.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Richey ignored it as he narrowed his possessions to
those that would fit in his green-and-tan Ford Explorer: baby
photos of his children, a change of clothes, his homeowners
insurance policy. Like his neighbors in this tiny community
northeast of Gainesville, Richey had to leave home as the state's
monthlong heat wave came to town in the form of an out-of-control
blaze that now burned just a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Fires continued burning around the state Wednesday as they have
for more than a week, but perhaps none burned closer to homes than
the blaze that by afternoon had consumed 3,000 acres just upwind of
Waldo.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters working in the 97-degree heat used bulldozers to
dig their last stand of sorts: a firebreak on the clear cut path
under some high-tension power lines on the western outskirts of
town, just a half-mile from Richey's Line Avenue house.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's on TV, it's interesting. When it happens to you,
it's a different story. It's scary,'' said Richey, a 42-year-old
mailman and former city council member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house is right in the line of fire,'' said Gertrude Hill,
a neighbor who had stuffed her Jeep full of mementos and was
heading to find a motel for the night.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 wildfires burned throughout Florida on Wednesday as
another day of temperatures in the 90s and consistent winds made
smoldering embers quick to flare up. Record high temperatures were
recorded around the state, including 96 in tampa, 99 in melbourne,
98 in daytona beach and 99 in orlando
</P>
<P>
   In all, 94 wildfires in 25 counties have burned nearly 43,000
acres since Memorial Day, causing at least 13 injuries and one
death and damaging at least 78 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some were intentionally set, and Wednesday brought the first
arrest. Police arrested a 12-year-old Putnam County boy on three
counts of unlawful burning of land, a felony.
</P>
<P>
   For Waldo, about as far from an ocean as is possible in Florida,
evacuations had been a rarity. Tornadoes are uncommon. Hurricanes
have typically lost their punch by the time they reached so far
inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a hurricane any day,'' grumbled Pete Hermanson, 65,
wearing a paper mask to filter the haze and setting lawn sprinklers
to wet down his roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what a fire is going to do, really. A
hurricane, you can board up,'' said Hermanson, who moved to Waldo
from Hollywood after a near miss by Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's recommended evacuation was the second in two days,
as the fates of the residents' homes changed, literally, with the
wind. Some 500 residents _ about half the town _ were asked to
leave their homes Tuesday when the fire first threatened. Winds
moved to a more favorable direction, the fire seemed to be
contained, and residents were told to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Then the wind shifted back to the southwest and kicked up
Wednesday, letting the fire jump Tuesday's fire break into new,
unburned territory. Alachua County Sheriff's officials again
advised residents to leave while considering whether to ask Gov.
Lawton Chiles to declare a mandatory evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't look like we're going to get a break with the
weather,'' said sheriff's spokeswoman Linda White as she scanned
the sky from the command post officials had set up on the median of
the road between Waldo and Gainesville. ``It's such an iffy
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's forecast calls for temperatures in the high 90s
throughout the state with a slight chance of thunderstorms in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the only cloud of any substance in Waldo was the
pillar of brown and black that billowed upward, giving the sun a
burnt orange cast in the middle of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies patrolled the streets, advising residents to get out
with a simple message: ``This thing is out of control and headed
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Community School Principal Dewitt Lewis meanwhile tried to
round up the latchkey children of parents who work in Gainesville
and to get them to board the city buses waiting in the parking lot
to shuttle those without car to a shelter at the Alachua County
Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kids that sometimes won't listen to anybody,'' he
said. ``As night falls, the smoke settles and it gets ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most adults, though, took the evacuation advisory seriously,
packing what they could and driving to friends, relatives or the
shelter. Down the street, Kevin Kelley, 40, finished wetting down
the shingled roofs to his mother's house and tool shed with water
pumped from a well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's worthwhile or not,'' said Kelley,
wrinkling his nose against the thickening wood smoke. ``I don't
know. It's strange. We've never had anything like this.''

 &HT;    Fires imperil Florida homes
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE -- As helicopters hauling huge buckets of water
buzzed flaming patches of trees, worried residents doused their
homes with lawn sprinklers and prayed that winds wouldn't send the
wildfires plaguing Florida any closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put the sprinkler on the roof and wet it down, that's all you
can do _ that and pray,'' said Gary Motley, who lives on this
sprawling city's west side.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen fires flared Wednesday in nine northeastern
Florida counties, most in rural, wooded areas between Jacksonville
and Gainesville. Dozens of people were evacuated from their homes
in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday, one structure was reported damaged by flames
that jumped firefighters' lines in the small town of Waldo.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have also hit Charlton County, Ga., just north of the
Florida state line. About 100 people were being asked to evacuate
their homes in Charlton County late Wednesday, said Lynn McElroy of
the Georgia Division of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 9,000 acres of rural timberland were reported
burned there, with teams of firefighters working to keep the flames
from reaching homes near the town of St. George.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's done a lot of damage, but we're fortunate that it didn't
get our house,'' said Jeanette Bell, a Charlton County resident who
had to evacuate Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There were also evacuations in Jacksonville's west side and in
Waldo, about 15 miles northeast of Gainesville. Waldo residents had
to evacuate Tuesday and were allowed to return to their homes
Wednesday, only to be told to leave again as the flames rekindled,
fueled by unseasonably hot temperatures and extremely dry
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know in the movies with the twisters and disasters _ last
night that's what it seemed like, everybody running around in a
small town,'' said Chad Ricey, 17, who helped his father, Michael,
carry their possessions to their car.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just take what you can,'' his father added. ``As long as
your family is out, everything else can be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries Wednesday evening in Waldo or
Jacksonville. But two Jacksonville firefighters were overcome with
smoke and exhaustion, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fires have plagued Florida for the past month, burning
43,000 acres in 25 counties stretching from the Panhandle to
Jacksonville and south to the Fort Myers area. The blazes have been
blamed for one death and 13 injuries and damaged 78 structures.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have asked for more firefighters and equipment
from neighboring states that are members of the 13-state
Southeastern Forest Compact. North Carolina sent 36 firefighters
and 10 bulldozers to the Florida fires.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not used to dealing with this large a situation,'' said
Bruce Hill, a spokesman for the Florida Forestry Division.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a dozen homes near St. Augustine burned, as well as
five homes in Hilliard, a small town north of Jacksonville near the
state line.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from the fires also prompted the Florida Highway Patrol to
close section of I-10 and I-95 on Tuesday, leading to massive
traffic jams and tempers almost as hot as the blazes. Both roads
were open Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month drought that has set the stage for the fires has
led to a water crisis in Jacksonville, with city officials
restricting lawn sprinkling and urging residents to conserve water.
Their fear is that water supplies will be pushed so low that
firefighters won't have anything to tap should the blazes bear down
on heavily populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jacksonville Mayor John Delaney also banned
fireworks and canceled the city's upcoming July 4th celebration, as
several other Florida cities are contemplating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective immediately, we're banning the use and sale of
fireworks,'' Delaney said. ``The risks are simply too high.''

 &HT;    South's rise again shown after 60 years
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A famous federal report of 1938 documenting the poor,
malaria-ridden South was revived Wednesday by an advisory board of
Southern governors for its sheer dramatic contrast with the
economic powerhouse the region has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education and Progress in the South,'' a glossy report
unveiled in Washington by the Southern Regional Education Board,
updated by 60 years much of the data originally compiled at the
request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Between then and now,
the region's transformation is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, the combined endowments of every college and university
in the South could not match those of Harvard and Yale, and the
exodus of its ablest people, including nearly half of the eminent
scientists born in the South, left too many children to be educated
by the poorest and oldest adult population in America.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the combined endowments of the University of Texas, Texas
A&AMP;M, Rice and Emory alone nearly match Harvard and Yale's. More
Southerners have college degrees now _ 21 percent _ than had high
school degrees 60 years ago. Houston is the nerve center of space
exploration, Atlanta is in the consciousness of the entire planet
24 hours a day through CNN and the world's most-recognized
trademark of Coca-Cola, and Research Triangle Park in North
Carolina is the leading example of business-university research
synergy, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any review of today's economic hot spots features a decidedly
Southern drawl _ Atlanta, Austin, the Research Triangle, Nashville,
Houston, Birmingham _ and the list goes on,'' U.S. Secretary of
Education Richard Riley said as he accepted the report.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southerners remember, and some still resent, the picture of
the South drawn by the 1938 report of the National Emergency Board
commissioned by Roosevelt. Roosevelt, who invoked his part-time
residence in Georgia and friendships there as part of his
motivation, said the main reason for the report was his view that
the South, as the last holdout of the Great Depression and ``the
nation's No. 1 economic problem,'' was keeping the country back.
</P>
<P>
   But few today have actually read the 64-page report, said
Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton, SREB chairman. ``The most important
point,'' he said, ``is that President Roosevelt was correct.''In
1938, the average income in the South was 52 percent of that in the
rest of the country. In the 1990s, the per capita income is 92
percent of the national average. Professionals are pouring into the
region, more than half of the country's job growth has been in the
South and two of the top five states in manufacturing growth are in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike SREB's typical reports filled with data on annual
progress toward various educational goals, the 16-page progress
report is a one-time celebraton of the South's, and SREB's, success
based on a historical coincidence. Mark Musick, president of the
Atlanta-based SREB, said the board felt it was time to take a
longer view of change in the South since this month is not only the
anniversary of the 1938 report, but also the 50th anniversary of
SREB.
</P>
<P>
   The SREB, funded by the governors of 15 Southern states, has
historically embodied the post-World War II agenda of Southern
leaders who believed the region's ticket out of the doldrums was to
invest in educational infrastructure and standards, first in the
colleges and universities, then in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   This vision, which also is reflected in the 1938 report through
the influence of the likes of former University of North Carolina
President Frank Porter Graham, focused more on regional poverty
than on racial injustice. Graham, at the time, said black and white
Southerners have ``fundamentally a common destiny in building a
nobler civilization, and, if we go up, we go up together.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians cite various factors behind the South's economic
success, from the dismantling of legal segregation to air
conditioning. But the SREB report, in suggesting causes, sticks to
its long-time agenda of investment in education funding and the
raising of academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   This agenda, like the South's economic boom, has spread beyond
the region itself. A 1988 SREB report setting 12 education
benchmarks for the 15 Southern states led to similar education
goals for the entire country. Many of its governor members, such as
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Riley of
South Carolina, have gone on to shape education policy nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in an inversion of the 1938 statistics, student-teacher
ratios in the South are lower than the U.S. average. Like 60 years
ago, Southern states spend a larger share of their tax dollars on
education, but that share is falling and teacher and faculty
salaries remain below the national average, said former Virginia
Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, chairman of the SREB Commission for
Educational Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the South is a place of remarkable progress and
momentum,'' Baliles wrote in the introduction. ``It will continue
to be if we recognize that our infrastructure now is as much
intellectual as it is physical.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report notes gaps in the infrastructure. A rural band of
600 counties running across the region's midsection holds 35
percent of the nation's poor and 90 percent of its poor blacks.
Racial inequality, an issue skimmed over by the 1938 report, is
today a continuing challenge to a prosperous South, the new report
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, recalling with a catch in his voice the public schools he
attended in Greenville, S.C., among folks that the 1938 report
compared to the poorest peasants of Europe, said he enjoyed
advantages that too many of his neighbors lacked. ``Southern
elementary, secondary and higher education was segregated,
under-funded, under-utilized and under-appreciated by the people of
an impoverished, agrarian society,'' he said.

ITALY BEATS CAMEROON 3-0 AND BENEFITS AGAIN FROM IFFY CALL BY
REFEREE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France, June 17 _ Luigi Di Bagio will remember how
he used his head to score Italy's 100th goal in the World Cup
finals. Alessandro Del Piero will remember how he came off the
bench midway through the second half and helped Christian Vieri
score two late goals and finish a workmanlike 3-0 victory in style.
</P>
<P>
   The Cameroonians will remember how they felt in the 43rd minute.
</P>
<P>
   In the 43rd minute, the Australian referee Lennie Edwards
sprinted across the field to send Raymond Kalla, a Cameroonian
defender, off the field for good with a red card. Kalla had not
tackled from behind, an act that FIFA president Joseph Blatter
wants banned. Kalla was trying to catch up with a ball he had been
dribbling comfortably until his last touch had pushed it too far
ahead. Di Biagio slid aggressively toward the ball and touched it
first. Kalla, a big man, kept coming and, upon arrival, his large
right foot made contact with the ball and his large left foot then
swung forward into the prone Di Biagio's lower body, causing him to
scream in pain.
</P>
<P>
   Cameroon would never get the chance to play with 11 men again,
and for the second time in two matches in this World Cup, a
controversial decision by a referee would work in favor of Italy,
which now leads Group B with 4 points heading into its final
first-round game against Austria on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In its opening match against Chile, Italy was trailing by 2-1 in
the 85th minute when referee Lucien Bouchardeau of Niger awarded
Italy a penalty kick after the Chilean defender Ronaldo Fuentes'
right fist got in the way of a ball kicked by Roberto Baggio.
Fuentes, whose fist was by his side when it touched the ball
meaning it was an unintentional hand ball, was understandably
surprised, and Baggio wasted no time knocking the penalty kick into
the net to salvage a draw and a point.
</P>
<P>
   Edward's decision Wednesday came at a much less crucial moment.
Cameroon already was trailing by 1-0 after Di Bagio's goal in the
seventh minute. But Kalla's red card reduced the young and gifted
Cameroonian players' chances of closing the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' said Kalla, who had not yet committed a foul
in the match. ``I mean the first thing I touched was the ball. I've
never gotten a red card before, not even in a club match. I think
the referee thought that I had fouled somebody earlier. He got me
confused with another player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians were sometimes in need of protection during this
testy, uneven match. There were several dangerous tackles from
behind by Cameroon players that were not sanctioned at all, and in
the end, four other Indomitable Lions were awarded four yellow
cards to go with Kalla's red. The Italians received two of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   DiBiagio was in the right place, unmarked and unflappable, when
Roberto Baggio found him with a cross in the seventh minute. By
then, all of Italy knew that Coach Cesare Maldini had elected to
ignore Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's suggestion that he use
Baggio and Del Piero together. Del Piero, one of the world's
premier players, is the man who made Baggio dispensable at his
former club, Juventus. But after Del Piero arrived in France with a
strained leg muscle and Baggio arrived in terrific form, the small
and speedy Del Piero became a substitute.
</P>
<P>
   When he replaced Baggio in the 65th minute Wednesday, Cameroon
was in the process of making the Italians forget their opponents
only had 10 men on the field. Instead of retreating into a
defensive shell, Cameroon had opened the second half aggressively,
and in the 58th minute Joseph-Desire Job, a substitute, had
Cameroon's best chance to score when he slammed a shot toward the
upper-left corner of the Italian goal that Gianluca Pagliuca barely
managed to knock away.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after Del Piero's arrival, the flow of the game
began to take a more logical direction. Vieri, the muscular
Atletico Madrid striker, would capitalize on a lovely pass from
Francesco Moriero to score in the 75th minute and on Del Piero's
penetration and a disoriented Cameroonian defense to score in the
89th. &QL;

 &HT;    Fire forces many to leave home
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALDO, Fla. _ After two weeks of oven-dry heat, it finally
rained Wednesday _ a mist of white and black ash that fell from an
eerily dark midday sky.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Richey ignored it as he narrowed his possessions to
those that would fit in his green-and-tan Ford Explorer: baby
photos of his children, a change of clothes, his homeowners
insurance policy. Like his neighbors in this tiny community
northeast of Gainesville, Richey had to leave home as the state's
monthlong heat wave came to town in the form of an out-of-control
blaze that now burned just a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Fires continued burning around the state Wednesday as they have
for more than a week, but perhaps none burned closer to homes than
the blaze that by afternoon had consumed 3,000 acres just upwind of
Waldo.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters working in the 97-degree heat used bulldozers to
dig their last stand of sorts: a firebreak on the clear cut path
under some high-tension power lines on the western outskirts of
town, just a half-mile from Richey's Line Avenue house.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's on TV, it's interesting. When it happens to you,
it's a different story. It's scary,'' said Richey, a 42-year-old
mailman and former city council member.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our house is right in the line of fire,'' said Gertrude Hill,
a neighbor who had stuffed her Jeep full of mementos and was
heading to find a motel for the night.
</P>
<P>
   At least 20 wildfires burned throughout Florida on Wednesday as
another day of temperatures in the 90s and consistent winds made
smoldering embers quick to flare up. Record high temperatures were
recorded around the state, including 96 in tampa, 99 in melbourne,
98 in daytona beach and 99 in orlando
</P>
<P>
   In all, 94 wildfires in 25 counties have burned nearly 43,000
acres since Memorial Day, causing at least 13 injuries and one
death and damaging at least 78 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some were intentionally set, and Wednesday brought the first
arrest. Police arrested a 12-year-old Putnam County boy on three
counts of unlawful burning of land, a felony.
</P>
<P>
   For Waldo, about as far from an ocean as is possible in Florida,
evacuations had been a rarity. Tornadoes are uncommon. Hurricanes
have typically lost their punch by the time they reached so far
inland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take a hurricane any day,'' grumbled Pete Hermanson, 65,
wearing a paper mask to filter the haze and setting lawn sprinklers
to wet down his roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what a fire is going to do, really. A
hurricane, you can board up,'' said Hermanson, who moved to Waldo
from Hollywood after a near miss by Hurricane Andrew in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's recommended evacuation was the second in two days,
as the fates of the residents' homes changed, literally, with the
wind. Some 500 residents _ about half the town _ were asked to
leave their homes Tuesday when the fire first threatened. Winds
moved to a more favorable direction, the fire seemed to be
contained, and residents were told to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Then the wind shifted back to the southwest and kicked up
Wednesday, letting the fire jump Tuesday's fire break into new,
unburned territory. Alachua County Sheriff's officials again
advised residents to leave while considering whether to ask Gov.
Lawton Chiles to declare a mandatory evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't look like we're going to get a break with the
weather,'' said sheriff's spokeswoman Linda White as she scanned
the sky from the command post officials had set up on the median of
the road between Waldo and Gainesville. ``It's such an iffy
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's forecast calls for temperatures in the high 90s
throughout the state with a slight chance of thunderstorms in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday the only cloud of any substance in Waldo was the
pillar of brown and black that billowed upward, giving the sun a
burnt orange cast in the middle of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies patrolled the streets, advising residents to get out
with a simple message: ``This thing is out of control and headed
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Community School Principal Dewitt Lewis meanwhile tried to
round up the latchkey children of parents who work in Gainesville
and to get them to board the city buses waiting in the parking lot
to shuttle those without car to a shelter at the Alachua County
Fairgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kids that sometimes won't listen to anybody,'' he
said. ``As night falls, the smoke settles and it gets ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Most adults, though, took the evacuation advisory seriously,
packing what they could and driving to friends, relatives or the
shelter. Down the street, Kevin Kelley, 40, finished wetting down
the shingled roofs to his mother's house and tool shed with water
pumped from a well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's worthwhile or not,'' said Kelley,
wrinkling his nose against the thickening wood smoke. ``I don't
know. It's strange. We've never had anything like this.''

 &HT;    South's rise again shown after 60 years
 &HT;    By Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- A famous federal report of 1938 documenting the poor,
malaria-ridden South was revived Wednesday by an advisory board of
Southern governors for its sheer dramatic contrast with the
economic powerhouse the region has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education and Progress in the South,'' a glossy report
unveiled in Washington by the Southern Regional Education Board,
updated by 60 years much of the data originally compiled at the
request of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Between then and now,
the region's transformation is stunning.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, the combined endowments of every college and university
in the South could not match those of Harvard and Yale, and the
exodus of its ablest people, including nearly half of the eminent
scientists born in the South, left too many children to be educated
by the poorest and oldest adult population in America.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the combined endowments of the University of Texas, Texas
A&AMP;M, Rice and Emory alone nearly match Harvard and Yale's. More
Southerners have college degrees now _ 21 percent _ than had high
school degrees 60 years ago. Houston is the nerve center of space
exploration, Atlanta is in the consciousness of the entire planet
24 hours a day through CNN and the world's most-recognized
trademark of Coca-Cola, and Research Triangle Park in North
Carolina is the leading example of business-university research
synergy, the report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any review of today's economic hot spots features a decidedly
Southern drawl _ Atlanta, Austin, the Research Triangle, Nashville,
Houston, Birmingham _ and the list goes on,'' U.S. Secretary of
Education Richard Riley said as he accepted the report.
</P>
<P>
   Many Southerners remember, and some still resent, the picture of
the South drawn by the 1938 report of the National Emergency Board
commissioned by Roosevelt. Roosevelt, who invoked his part-time
residence in Georgia and friendships there as part of his
motivation, said the main reason for the report was his view that
the South, as the last holdout of the Great Depression and ``the
nation's No. 1 economic problem,'' was keeping the country back.
</P>
<P>
   But few today have actually read the 64-page report, said
Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton, SREB chairman. ``The most important
point,'' he said, ``is that President Roosevelt was correct.''In
1938, the average income in the South was 52 percent of that in the
rest of the country. In the 1990s, the per capita income is 92
percent of the national average. Professionals are pouring into the
region, more than half of the country's job growth has been in the
South and two of the top five states in manufacturing growth are in
the South.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike SREB's typical reports filled with data on annual
progress toward various educational goals, the 16-page progress
report is a one-time celebraton of the South's, and SREB's, success
based on a historical coincidence. Mark Musick, president of the
Atlanta-based SREB, said the board felt it was time to take a
longer view of change in the South since this month is not only the
anniversary of the 1938 report, but also the 50th anniversary of
SREB.
</P>
<P>
   The SREB, funded by the governors of 15 Southern states, has
historically embodied the post-World War II agenda of Southern
leaders who believed the region's ticket out of the doldrums was to
invest in educational infrastructure and standards, first in the
colleges and universities, then in the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   This vision, which also is reflected in the 1938 report through
the influence of the likes of former University of North Carolina
President Frank Porter Graham, focused more on regional poverty
than on racial injustice. Graham, at the time, said black and white
Southerners have ``fundamentally a common destiny in building a
nobler civilization, and, if we go up, we go up together.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians cite various factors behind the South's economic
success, from the dismantling of legal segregation to air
conditioning. But the SREB report, in suggesting causes, sticks to
its long-time agenda of investment in education funding and the
raising of academic standards.
</P>
<P>
   This agenda, like the South's economic boom, has spread beyond
the region itself. A 1988 SREB report setting 12 education
benchmarks for the 15 Southern states led to similar education
goals for the entire country. Many of its governor members, such as
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Riley of
South Carolina, have gone on to shape education policy nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in an inversion of the 1938 statistics, student-teacher
ratios in the South are lower than the U.S. average. Like 60 years
ago, Southern states spend a larger share of their tax dollars on
education, but that share is falling and teacher and faculty
salaries remain below the national average, said former Virginia
Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, chairman of the SREB Commission for
Educational Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the South is a place of remarkable progress and
momentum,'' Baliles wrote in the introduction. ``It will continue
to be if we recognize that our infrastructure now is as much
intellectual as it is physical.''
</P>
<P>
   But the report notes gaps in the infrastructure. A rural band of
600 counties running across the region's midsection holds 35
percent of the nation's poor and 90 percent of its poor blacks.
Racial inequality, an issue skimmed over by the 1938 report, is
today a continuing challenge to a prosperous South, the new report
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Riley, recalling with a catch in his voice the public schools he
attended in Greenville, S.C., among folks that the 1938 report
compared to the poorest peasants of Europe, said he enjoyed
advantages that too many of his neighbors lacked. ``Southern
elementary, secondary and higher education was segregated,
under-funded, under-utilized and under-appreciated by the people of
an impoverished, agrarian society,'' he said.

SENATE KILLS TOBACCO BILL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for the tobacco industry, Senate
Republicans Wednesday buried an anti-smoking measure after almost
four weeks of roller-coaster debate over proposals to sharply raise
cigarette prices and regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by GOP Senate leaders to shelve the most ambitious
legislation to come before Congress this session drew sharp
criticism from President Clinton, who made it clear that he
believed the lawmakers were influenced by tobacco company lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has pumped millions of dollars into a national ad
campaign characterizing the legislation as a big tax, big
government program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the tobacco lobby and its allies on Capitol Hill to
know that from my point of view this battle is far from over,''
Clinton said after a series of parliamentary maneuvers essentially
killed the bill. ``If more members of the Senate would vote like
parents rather than politicians, we could solve this problem and go
on to other business.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Asked if there would be political repercussions for those who
killed the bill, Clinton replied: ``I certainly hope there will be,
and there should be. I think when the American people understand
fully what has been going on they won't like what they see.''
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the tobacco
legislation had become too unwieldy. GOP members tacked on a number
of amendments, such as effort to remedy the so-call ``marriage
penalty'' in the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's wrong with the bill now is it's lost sight of the
original noble cause of just dealing with teen-age smoking and drug
abuse,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation would have raised cigarette prices by
$1.10 a pack and generated $516 billion over 25 years. It would
have given the federal government broad power to regulate tobacco
products and prohibited tobacco advertising aimed at youths.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the legislation a ``smokescreen,'' Sen. John Ashcroft,
R-Mo., said the measure amounted to ``a massive tax on low-income
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican action was denounced by former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop, a Reagan appointee, who has led public health
spokesmen advocating anti-tobacco legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that the senators who derailed this bill lose sleep
every night listening to the sound of children taking their first
puff and the sound of emphysema and cancer patients gasping for
their last strength,'' said Koop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Republican senators know that they should be protecting
children and not big tobacco, but they just couldn't make
themselves do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   During the lengthy debate, amendments to divert some of the
money generated by price increases for tax cuts and anti-drug
programs and to cap attorney's fees were added to try and woo
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Though a clear majority of senators supported the bill,
conservatives successfully used procedural tactics to shoot it
down.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans, particularly those from the Northeast, had
been supportive of the measure, and proponents came within three
votes of the 60 needed to end debate and force a straight majority
vote on the bill's merits.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents then challenged the bill on a technicality, and
supporters fell seven votes shy of the 60 required to waive budget
constraints, effectively killing the measure. Texas Republicans
Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison joined those lawmakers voting
to bury the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, in particular, has been an outspoken critic, arguing the
legislation would impose unfair costs on low- and moderate-income
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill has no support in America,'' said Gramm after a
meeting where Republicans settled on their floor strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, who voted for the bill in the Commerce Committee,
refused to comment as she left the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On the Senate floor Democrats angrily denounced some Republicans
for demanding that tax cuts and anti-drug programs be added to the
measure and then voting to kill it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this bill goes down today Joe Camel wins and our kids
lose,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, referring to the popular
cartoon advertising icon.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring that the ``this is not the end of this issue'' Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., vowed to tack the tobacco bill onto every
piece of legislation considered by the Senate this year.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, gave one Republican, Sen. John McCain, the
sponsor of the bill, a standing applause after he warned that the
losers in the measure would be the children who started smoking.
</P>
<P>
   While the Arizonan and other moderates have feared that tobacco
could be a potent issue in the next election, an increasing number
of Republicans have to come to believe that voters are
disinterested in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is people are not coming up to members and saying
this is an issue you have to deal with,'' said Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats believe they can use the tobacco issue
against Republicans, particularly because GOP lawmakers have been
the primary beneficiary of millions of dollars of tobacco
contributions over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was thrust into the public arena last June when state
attorneys general and tobacco executives reached an unprecedented
agreement that would have required the industry to pay out $368
billion over 25 years to settle lawsuits brought by the states.
</P>
<P>
   That pact, however, was immediately attacked by public health
leaders as not tough enough because it provided some legal
concessions to the industry in the form of immunity from some
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Commerce Committee, chaired by McCain, threw out
most of the legal protections and raised the cost to the industry
to $516 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill passed overwhelmingly in committee, it has
steadily lost support as the tobacco industry stepped up its
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton held out hope that Congress might still deal with
the tobacco issue this year, there is little chance that the
massive Senate bill will be resurrected.
</P>
<P>
   And in the House, Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., has made it
clear that Republicans will not consider a tobacco bill that
includes major price increases.

AMERICA ONLINE ANNOUNCES IT WILL STAY INDEPENDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dc) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON and SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cooling off merger discussions with AT&AMP;T Corp., America Online
Inc., the United States' largest cyberspace company, said Wednesday
that it would remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   America Online has been in preliminary talks about a potential
acquisition by AT&AMP;T, the nation's No. 1 long-distance company, for
several weeks, according to people close to the discussions. But on
Wednesday, America Online's top executives said they had no
intention of selling the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to remaining an independent company, as that
is the best course for our customers, shareholders and employees,''
Stephen Case, the company's chairman, and Robert Pittman, its
president, said in an e-mail message to employees. ``We continue to
be eager to establish alliances with a wide range of
telecommunications, media and technology companies.''
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the companies said that while Case appeared
to oppose the idea of a merger, Pittman was willing to consider
such a move. The conversations between the two companies were
described by one person involved in the talks as ``fluid.'' The
person said that several issues needed to be worked out before any
deal could be announced.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the two companies were discussing the fate of
Tel-Save Holdings Inc., a small independent long-distance company
that owns the exclusive right to market long-distance service on
America Online. In acquiring America Online, AT&AMP;T would presumably
want to use the online service to sell long-distance service. But
there remain questions about whether AT&AMP;T would agree to acquire
Tel-Save for a price above its $1.1 billion market value, in
addition to agreeing to acquire America Online.
</P>
<P>
   One indication that the talks had not progressed far enough to
include a concrete offer was that Case did not discuss details of
the merger discussions with America Online's board members until
The Financial Times reported Wednesday that America Online had
rejected an offer from AT&AMP;T, said a person close to America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Still, people close to AT&AMP;T said that Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's
chairman, had meetings with top executives at America Online's
headquarters in Dulles, Va., during the week of May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps as telling as the talks themselves is what they reveal
about the direction that Armstrong wants to take AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to jump-start AT&AMP;T's entry into local phone markets,
Armstrong helped engineer AT&AMP;T's $11.3 billion acquisition of
Teleport Communications Group, a leading competitive local phone
provider, in January.
</P>
<P>
   But that deal was mostly speculative; it may be years before
AT&AMP;T offers local phone service to millions of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring America Online would be another bid for the future,
but it would have an immediate impact on AT&AMP;T's growth prospects
and on the structure of the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has built a sizable business providing Internet access to
consumers, serving 1.1 million customers. America Online has about
12 million customers and enjoys a brand that consumers associate
with cyberspace, rather than with monthly long-distance bills.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to the Tel-Save question, any deal between AT&AMP;T
and America Online would face serious hurdles of finance and
corporate politics as well as potential personality clashes.
</P>
<P>
   One problem for AT&AMP;T could be financial, though that does not
seem to have deterred Armstrong. As the most widely held stock in
the nation, AT&AMP;T is mainly valued based on its ability to deliver
steady earnings growth. But America Online's shares trade at almost
10 times the multiple of estimated earnings for this year than do
AT&AMP;T's.
</P>
<P>
   That means that if AT&AMP;T acquired America Online using stock, all
the new shares would heavily dilute AT&AMP;T's future per-share
profits. AT&AMP;T could use cash, but that would require servicing a
huge amount of debt. America Online has a market value of about
$20.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   More personally, Case recently joined the board of Worldcom
Inc., the No. 4 long-distance company, which has agreed to acquire
MCI Communications Corp., AT&AMP;T's archrival.
</P>
<P>
   Case joined Worldcom's board after America Online agreed last
year to sell its data communications network to Worldcom in a
complex three-way transaction in which Worldcom also acquired the
network of Compuserve, another big online service, while America
Online took over Compuserve's customers.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is now one of Worldcom's biggest customers.
Presumably, one of the financial rationales behind AT&AMP;T's seeking
to acquire America Online is that some of America Online's traffic
could be moved to AT&AMP;T's network, saving costs. It is unclear,
however, if the arrangements between America Online and Worldcom
would allow that.

   NEW YORK _ In the Clinton administration's first formal response
to cautious overtures from a moderate president of Iran, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright invited the Iranians on Wednesday to
join the United States in drawing up ``a road map leading to normal
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years after the 1979 Iranian Revolution ruptured
relations with Washington and installed a fundamentalist Islamic
government in Tehran, Albright said that it was time to find ways
to bridge the gap between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Failure to do so would be irresponsible,'' she said, insisting
that the United States had no quarrel with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, long regarded as one of the administration's harshest
critics of Iran, changed course in a speech prepared for delivery
in New York and hailed President Mohammad Khatami, who took office
last summer, as a man who ``deserves respect because he is the
choice of the Iranian people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secretary of State went on to list steps Iran has taken in
recent months that have been viewed favorably in Washington,
including giving public support to Yasser Arafat rather than more
radical leaders or groups as the voice of Palestinians in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that Khatami had denounced terrorism and condemned the
killing of civilians in Israel in January. She also mentioned
Iran's record in fighting drugs and its efforts to help bring peace
to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view these developments with interest, both with regard to
the possibility of Iran assuming its rightful place in the world
community, and the chance for better bilateral ties,'' Albright
said in a speech to the Asia Society that looked broadly across the
region from Iran to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   On the negative side, Albright repeated American concerns about
Iran's attempts to acquire missiles and weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical and nuclear arms. She also lamented
``inflammatory and unacceptable'' Iranian denunciations of Israel,
which Tehran does not recognize.
</P>
<P>
   She asked for more progress in ending serious abuses of human
rights. She did not mention the case of Salman Rushdie, the
Indian-born British writer on whom the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini pronounced a death sentence for blasphemy after the
publication in 1988 of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel in which
Muslims found derogatory references to their faith and its founder.
A senior official said tonight that this issue has always been part
of the administration's human rights agenda on Iran, and it was not
necessary to mention it on every occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Noting relaxed rules on travel to and from Iran, Albright said
that cultural and academic exchanges are being actively supported
and that ``we are ready to explore further ways to build mutual
confidence and avoid misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Islamic Republic should consider parallel steps,'' she
said. ``If such a process can be initiated and sustained in a way
that addresses the concerns of both sides, then we in the United
States can see a very different relationship. As the wall of
mistrust comes down, we can develop with the Islamic republic, when
it is ready, a road map leading to normal relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright spoke tonight against a backdrop of deep and unsettling
changes in Asia that administration officials said played a part in
her opening to Iran. Nuclear tests in India and Pakistan have
abruptly changed the atmosphere across the region, sparking
concerns that Iran as well as Iraq could renew hopes of developing
nuclear arms. At the moment the United States has no leverage in
Iran, and is losing support for its policy of continued sanctions
in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore the Asian economic crisis is beginning to have
ripple effects around the world, adding to the problems India and
Pakistan will face because of the loss of World Bank loans and
other financial assistance as a result of the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis figured in Albright's speech. On the
day that President Clinton stepped in to support the faltering
Japanese currency, she told the Japanese that ``more needs to be
done'' to contain the crisis. ''Action is essential to strengthen
Japan's economy so it can once more serve as the engine of Asian
growth.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Indonesia, which she described as ``a country of critical
strategic importance'' to the United States, Albright stopped short
of endorsing President B.J. Habibie's proposals for the gradual
establishment of a genuinely democratic electoral system.
</P>
<P>
   But in a gesture of confidence, she announced that all American
diplomats evacuated from the country in May during the unrest that
led to the fall of President Suharto would now return, and that the
United States would step up aid in food and support for democratic
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Still the largest portion of her address was devoted to Iran and
the administration's long-delayed response to overtures made to the
United States by President Khatami in an interview with CNN in
January. In that interview, Khatami, who was elected a year ago
despite the opposition of the country's conservative religious
leadership, spoke of his respect for the American government
because it reflected ``the great American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who was elected with the strong support of Iranian
women and others in the society who hope for a relaxation of almost
20 years of harsh Islamic rule, has recently come under new
pressures from conservatives who want to reverse the trend. Some
experts have criticized the Clinton administration for not
extending, however carefully or warily, a hand of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Albright went out of her way in her speech to demonstrate that
the United States was not ``anti-Islamic'' and that Americans would
do well to learn to understand ``Eastern civilization and Islamic
civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Islam is the fastest-growing religious faith in the United
States,'' she said. ``We respect deeply its moral teachings and its
role as a source of inspiration and instruction for hundreds of
millions of people around the world.''

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Here at ``The Goldwater Arizona Republic,'' with
offices conveniently located on Goldwater Van Buren Street in
downtown Goldwater Phoenix in the state of Goldwater Arizona, we
were awestruck by the City Council's decision to rename the local
metropolitan airport Goldwater Sky Harbor International.
</P>
<P>
   How can we not marvel at the accomplishment?
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to offend as few people as possible by choosing
simply to tack the Goldwater name onto the existing Sky Harbor
name, the Council managed to offend EVERYBODY.
</P>
<P>
   Success on that level won't go unnoticed by other politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Any day, now, I expect elected officials with each city, county
and state government entity to spring into action.
</P>
<P>
   None of them can claim to be first, of course. The Goldwater
Phoenix City Council won that race by naming something big for the
former senator before anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   They had to. The Goldwater rush was on.
</P>
<P>
   If they'd waited a few weeks to allow their own citizens to make
a suggestion or two of their own, somebody might have done it
before them.
</P>
<P>
   Any day now you'll be able to take a little stroll into the
Goldwater Grand Canyon, maybe even all the way down to the
Goldwater Colorado River.
</P>
<P>
   You might get there, in part, by driving along historic
Goldwater Route 66.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the Goldwater Phoenix City Council that struck the
mother lode first, ignoring the stated wishes of thousands of
living citizens and, near as I can tell, one deceased former
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Council took its vote Tuesday, I told an aide of
Mayor Goldwater Skip Rimsza about a newspaper article that appeared
in the Nov. 4, 1990, issue of what was then called ``The Arizona
Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   It begins:
</P>
<P>
   ``Several years ago, Barry Goldwater flatly rejected the
suggestion that Sky Harbor International Airport be renamed for
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goldwater turned down the honor, he said, because 'Sky Harbor'
is a name rich in tradition and treasured by thousands of pilots
and countless passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But last year, when then-Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard proposed
that Sky Harbor's new $280 million terminal be named for Goldwater,
the 81-year-old retired U.S. senator from Arizona relented.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'When they got down to the building, I couldn't raise any
objection to that,' Goldwater said. 'It's a great honor. . .' ''
</P>
<P>
   And it was. And it is.
</P>
<P>
   But, for Goldwater Skip and his gold-digging compadres, it
wasn't enough. Who knows? Maybe the senator changed his mind
sometime before his death. Or even after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater Skip and Goldwater Grant Woods, the state Attorney
General who pushed for the name change, say Goldwater IS Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   And they plan to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Goldwater Skip said the airport's name should be changed even if
it was something the senator never asked for.
</P>
<P>
   Along those lines, you'll soon be able to stroll over the
Goldwater London Bridge, swim in Goldwater Roosevelt Lake, explore
the ancient mysteries of Goldwater Montezuma Castle and witness a
re-enactment of the gunfight at the Goldwater OK Corral.
</P>
<P>
   Next fall, an adult education course on renaming everything
after Goldwater will be offered at Aqua de Oro Rio Salado Community
College.
</P>
<P>
   And you'll be happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   You will.
</P>
<P>
   Because, as you cruise south on the Goldwater Squaw Peak
Highway, staring at a downtown skyline dominated by the new
baseball stadium, you'll finally be able to smile.
</P>
<P>
   What had been the Bank One Ballpark will have become Goldwater
BOB, which sound's nothing like a financial institution and
everything like the senator's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   That would please all of us.
</P>
<P>
   And Barry, too. &QL;

U.S.-IRAN SOCCER MATCH: PLAYERS TRY TO DE-EMPHASIZE POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   YSSINGEAUX, France _ Jalal Talebi, who was appointed May 21 as
Iran's fourth national soccer coach in the past seven months, has
kept a residence for 17 years in the San Francisco Bay Area. His
wife, Sira, owns a skin care business and a vegetarian restaurant
near Stanford University. His two oldest sons attended college in
the area, and his youngest son, 17-year-old Bardia, is an
accomplished soccer player who hopes to play at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Although he met U.S. coach Steve Sampson only once for a brief
moment, the two men actually coached at different times at the same
junior college in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Such familiar suburban existences have significantly undercut
the stereotypes surrounding this Sunday's World Cup meeting between
Iran and the United States, initially viewed as a battle of
ideologies between the forces of the Great Satan and the
conservative clerics who ritualistically call for ``Death to
America.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the match was announced last December, the game
was as intriguing for the expected nationalistic and political
tension as it was for the outcome on the field. And as Sunday's
game approaches, there is no avoiding the political component in
the first soccer match between these two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called for a
movement toward normal relations between the US and Iran. At the
same time, Iranian exile groups opposed to the Islamic regime
threatened to disrupt Sunday's game. Meanwhile, an insulted Iranian
team continued to protest Monday's airing on French television of
an American movie that harshly depicts fundamentalist life in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   But both teams are largely playing down the 20 years of bad
blood between the countries. In fact, there are as many
similarities and shared aspirations as there are differences
between the two teams seeking international respect as
soccer-playing nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a political man, I am a sportsman,'' said Talebi, a
53-year-old Iranian native, on Wednesday here at Iran's training
camp southwest of Lyon, where the game will take place. ``We came
here to show everyone there is no problems between people of two
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Talebi left Iran in 1980, a year after the Islamic revolution
redefined Iranian society under the strict rules of strict
fundamentalism and soccer was abandoned. As a coach, he said he had
to look for work elsewhere, so he sent his wife and three sons to
the United States to stay with a friend and he became a soccer
vagabond, coaching in the United Arab Emirates, Dubai and Malaysia,
as well as at two junior colleges in northern California. The 1994
World Cup came virtually to his doorstep in Palo Alto, Calif., and
he sat and watched in the stands at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   None of the family members are U.S. citizens, but Talebi said
they are legal residents. Sira Talebi, his wife, said Tuesday from
Palo Alto, Calif., that her American friends were excited about
Sunday's game, but hardly for political or nationalistic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends just want to see my husband on TV,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She has put up no team pictures or Iranian flags at her store,
she said, because she did not want to make a political statement.
``It is a friendly game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sira Talebi said she would be too nervous to watch the game, so
she would go for a walk instead. Asked whom she would root for, she
said, ``I can't say.'' Then she added: ``I hope they play good. My
husband, of course, if he's coaching something, I want him to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also an important one for both teams, who lost their
opening matches and are in desperate need of victory. The
Americans, with greater competitive aspirations, will not consider
their World Cup a success unless they advance beyond the first
round of group play. And after a 2-0 loss to Germany on Monday,
they cannot achieve their goal without beating Iran. So they need a
victory for victory's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the American players are so young, Sampson said, that
they have ``no idea'' of the suffering of American hostages who
were captured at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held
captive for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the political overtones of Sunday's match,
midfielder Tab Ramos said: ``I don't think we really care about
that. I think that's more important to them than us. I haven't
heard anyone say, `Let's beat Iran, let's do it for Bill
Clinton.'''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had ever heard the term Great Satan, midfielder
Frankie Hejduk said Tuesday, ``What's that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians, by contrast, were the last team to qualify for the
32-team field. This is their first appearance in the World Cup in
20 years, and there was never any real chance of advancing to the
second round, especially not after Sunday's 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia
and with a game remaining against three-time world champion
Germany, where victory seems all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Iranians want to win against America because this is
the one game they believe they can win. The Americans looked
particularly timid and vulnerable against Germany, while Iran
appeared fearless in a 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas Torabian, director of the international division of the
Iranian soccer federation, said recently in Tehran that Iran was
greatly anticipating this match ``because we think we defeat the
United States team. We think it's easy team, not that much
difficult.''

 YSSINGEAUX, France: much difficult.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before Albright's overture Tuesday, Mohammad Khatami, the
relatively moderate president of Iran, had called for cultural
exchanges between the two countries to break down a ``wall of
mistrust,'' and many Iranian fans and players said they hoped this
match would improve relations. Some said they hoped soccer
diplomacy might do what ping-pong diplomacy did for relations
between China and the United States almost three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any problems with the United States players,''
said Alireza Mansourian, an Iranian midfielder. ``We want to find
new friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, politics inevitably keeps bubbling to the surface. After
Iranian wrestlers were held up in customs on a visit to the United
States this spring, Iran prevented the Americans from scouting a
pre-World Cup tournament in Tehran, Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   Khodadad Azizi, the top Iranian forward and the Asian player of
the year in 1997, repeating a familiar theme in Iran, said he
believed the United States had imposed the eight-year Iran-Iraq War
for its own purposes in 1980. Some 500,000 Iranians were killed or
injured during the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not lose the game,'' Azizi said during a pre-World Cup
tournament in Tehran. ``Many families of martyrs are expecting us
to win. We will win for their sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Azizi said it was ``imperative'' that Iran win the
match, which he called ``the most important of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of exiled Iranians who played on the country's last
World Cup team, in 1978, said at a news conference in Paris last
week that they believed Sunday's game would have little effect in
improving diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
   The players accused the fundamentalist regime of killing in 1984
the captain of the 1978 team, Habib Khabiri, for political reasons.
And they said they believed that conservative clerics who hold
ultimate power in Iran will use the game for propaganda purposes,
the way Hitler used the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Another political brushfire broke out this week, when French
television showed the movie ``Not Without My Daughter,'' starring
Sally Field and depicting the true story of an American woman who
left Iran with her daughter against the wishes of her Iranian
husband.
</P>
<P>
   The controversial movie grimly depicted life in Iran under the
laws of religious fundamentalism. The Iranian soccer federation has
filed a protest with soccer's world governing body over the timing
of the showing of the movie. Talebi called the movie ``insulting''
and accused the private French network that broadcast it of
deliberately trying to roil political waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not the right thing to show this untrue thing about
Iranian culture,'' Talebi said. ``In the World Cup, everyone speaks
of unity and love and togetherness and somebody shows this film.
Nobody can benefit, except to make everybody unhappy in our camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Two decades after the Islamic revolution, soccer has been
revived as a great secular passion in Iran. Millions took to the
streets in spontaneous demonstration after Iran qualified for the
World Cup in November and an estimated 5,000 women pushed their way
into the national stadium, where they are normally forbidden, to
greet the team on its return from a playoff match in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   But the team has been in chaos since, having had four coaches in
the past seven months. The Iranians prefer an open, Brazilian style
featuring individual flair, and, when the defensive tactics of a
Croat named Tomislav Ivic failed to produce desired results, he was
sacked and Talebi was hired three weeks before the World Cup began.
</P>
<P>
   His newly-fashioned team attacked assertively, played cohesively
and committed 30 fouls with hard tackling against Yugoslavia. Iran
is preparing for Sunday's match here in the small town of
Yssingeaux, which has housed the team in a castle that now serves
as the National Higher College of Bakery.

<P>
   Iran's top three players - the forwards Azizi and Ali Daei and
midfielder Karim Bagheri - all play professionally in Germany's
highly-regarded Bundesliga. Azizi is from a poor farming family,
and he said that his father believed that even soccer, with its
minimal requirements, was too expensive a game. His father wanted
him to work on the farm, he said, but his mother ``packed our bags
secretly and let us go play.''
</P>
<P>
   Daei is a metallurgical engineer whose father did not want him
playing soccer until he had graduated from high school. But his
mother, like Azizi's, was sympathetic. ``I used to leave home
without my football uniform and my mother would smuggle it out for
me so that I could play,'' Daei said.
</P>
<P>
   Before last weekend's match against Yugoslavia, the Iranian
players presented their opponents with roses. Talebi said his team
would make a similar gesture of friendship and sportsmanship with
the U.S. players. ``I promise, there will be a surprise,'' the
coach said.
</P>
<P>
   As he drove away, Talebi added, ``Please don't make it too big
for us. This is a game. A game.''

CHANGES AT THE TOP FOR AMERICAN THEATER WING
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saying that she craved more time to expand the
educational programs of the American Theater Wing, Isabelle
Stevenson said Wednesday that she would hand over the day-to-day
running of the organization to Roy Somlyo, who has been involved
with the wing's Tony Awards broadcasts since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevenson, who has been president of the wing for 33 years,
will become the chairwoman, the first person to hold that post
since the death of Antoinette Perry in 1946. Somlyo will take over
as president.
</P>
<P>
   The wing's board approved the change on Tuesday night, and it
was announced at a monthly meeting of the Tony Administration
Committee on Wednesday afternoon at the offices of the League of
American Producers and Theaters, which presents the Tony with the
wing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found that I had little time to do so much that I wanted to
do,'' Ms. Stevenson said. ``I had been thinking about this for a
few years, and with the end of the season, and a very strenuous
season at that, it seemed like a logical time to make the change.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides presenting the Tony Awards, the wing sponsors
professional seminars, outreach efforts to introduce students to
the theater, a hospital program and an annual awarding of grants
and scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevenson said she intended to export the wing's Working in
the Theater seminars to other cities, and also to expand the
Introduction to Broadway program that the wing conducts at public
and parochial schools in the five boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isabelle is the greatest asset that the American Theater Wing
has, and we really should exploit that,'' Somlyo said. ``If she
removes herself from day-to-day operations, she can concentrate on
expanding some of the existing programs. She's an established
persona and we ought to be able to capitalize on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Somlyo, who has been managing producer of the Tony
Administration Committee for 12 years, has had a long career as a
Broadway producer and manager. Now, he said, he will devote his
full efforts to the wing. ``I don't anticipate any abrupt
changes,'' he said. ``I think this is more of a natural segue,
really.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Dobie, another veteran manager and producer, will succeed
Somlyo as the managing producer of the Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   The theater wing's earliest incarnation dates back to 1917, but
it became the American Wing of the British War Relief Society in
the 1930s. The wing began awarding Tonys, named for Antoinette
Perry, in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The wing has never solicited corporate contributions, Somlyo
said, but has accepted them when offered. Now, he said, he intends
to start actively soliciting corporate money to help pay for
service activities, scholarships and grants.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevenson and Somlyo will assume their new posts on Sept. 1.
Somlyo said he would use the summer for an orderly transition.  &QL;

ANALYSIS: A NEW ECONOMIC ERA FOR JAPAN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DOLLAR-YEN, JAPAN-ECON, JAPAN-ECONSCENE,
JAPAN-MARKETPLACE, CREDIT, MARKET) 
(bl) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ As currency trading resumed Thursday morning in Asia,
the central question was simply: How much has changed?
</P>
<P>
   Has Japan, in making pledges Wednesday on an economic program to
strengthen its economy, really committed itself to far-reaching
changes? Do its pledges mark a turning point that will lead to a
firmer yen and to greater economic stability for Asia as a whole?
</P>
<P>
   Or are they merely warmed-over promises from yesterday? If so,
will the currency intervention by the United States and Japan be
overwhelmed within a few days by market forces, leading to an
ever-cheaper yen and to greater economic turmoil around the world?
</P>
<P>
   For now there are more questions than answers, but there is
evidence for both propositions.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States emphasized that Japan has agreed to more
specific actions, almost all the elements of the economic program
are already longstanding elements of Japanese policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognizing that restructuring and revitalization of the
Japanese economy are urgently needed, we will make every effort to
restore its banking system to health, to achieve domestic
demand-led growth, and to open and deregulate its markets,'' Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in a statement after a conversation
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Hashimoto has said the same things many times before.
Indeed, his latest comment was not nearly as strong as his
assertion a couple of years ago that he would restructure Japan
``or else burn up in flames trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Hashimoto pledged this time to abandon the ``convoy
system,'' whereby financial institutions move in tandem and are
hurriedly repaired or given new gas whenever they risk falling
behind. Yet Japanese officials have been saying since last year
that the convoy system has already ended.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe that Japan is likely to tinker with the
system rather than rapidly introduce fundamental changes, as the
markets would like.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's this Japanese view that if they just correct the
financial misadjustments, they'll be OK,'' said Ronald Morse, a
professor of economics and business administration at Reitaku
University near Tokyo. Morse said he doubted that any major change
was likely soon.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Japan has not made any stunning new commitments that
might convince the markets, there are some reasons why Wednesday's
joint intervention may mark a turning point. Above all, there is
timing.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Japan's Parliament passed a supplementary
budget that amounts to the go-ahead for a stimulus package, worth
roughly $119 billion, that is the centerpiece of plans to revive
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese officials have been saying for months that Americans
should not be too impatient, that the parliamentary process will
take time, but that once passed, the package will revive the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The government has already made all the preparations to spend
the money, simply waiting for the measure's passage to push the
button, and so the funds are now going to trickle through Japan's
economic arteries almost immediately. There is some disagreement
about exactly how to measure the stimulus package and how effective
it will be, but almost everyone agrees that it is a major and
credible effort to stimulate economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Another element of timing is that Hashimoto has long been
expected to introduce new economic measures _ presumably more
far-reaching efforts at restructuring than anything announced so
far _ after elections for the upper house of Parliament on July 12.
So if Washington and Tokyo can prop up the yen with promises and
the odd billion dollars worth of market intervention for just a few
more weeks, then the combination of the stimulus package and the
new measures announced by Japan after the election may in turn
support the yen at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of precedents for political action creating
turning points in the market. In 1985, the United States engineered
the Plaza Accord to end the strong dollar and bolster the value of
other currencies, and then by April 1995 the yen had soared so high
that Japan organized what has been called a ``reverse Plaza
Accord'' to weaken its currency.
</P>
<P>
   It then took only a little less than 80 yen to buy a dollar, but
Japan managed to turn the trend around and the yen steadily sank
ever since _ reaching an eight-year low of about 146 yen to the
dollar earlier this week. So now the governments are apparently
aiming for a ``reverse-reverse-Plaza Accord'' that would rely on
jawboning, intervention and shrewd timing to send the yen
permanently to higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some fundamental reasons to be skeptical about
whether the current coordinated effort can really change the market
environment for the yen. The currency has been tumbling in part
because Japanese capital has been fleeing abroad in search of
higher interest rates, and that is unlikely to change.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, even some Japanese government officials worry that
restructuring the economy along market lines _ while advantageous
for the long run _ may in the short term create more anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto pledged, for example, to ``expeditiously restructure
the financial system.'' It is not clear what that means, but many
analysts believe that Japan has too many banks and that some should
be put out of the public's misery. Thus, a serious restructuring
might lead to more bankruptcies and bank failures, and it is not
clear that in the short run such actions would do much for public
sentiment or the strength of the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the package does for the Japanese economy and the yen,
it presumably will be helpful to Hashimoto and his ruling Liberal
Democratic Party. Hashimoto has been criticized in Japan for not
doing enough to revive the economy, and he can now argue that he is
working in conjunction with President Clinton to tackle the
problems.

</P>
<P>
   Sure you did. Twice, probably.

<P>
   So find the will power. Dig deep. Reach back. Don't fall into

``Everybody Loves Raymond'' was a hoot.

<P>
   And the one where they bowl over the egotistical suits
representing the tobacco companies.

   Hang in there. Be tough. Be strong.

 WASHINGTON: industry further.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   But the industry went on the attack, with heavy advertising. As
Clinton, mindful of his experience on health care, said, ``Those of
us in politics know that unanswered ads can sometimes be fatal.''
And as the ads ran across eight weeks, Republicans began sounding
the same themes and toughening their stance against McCain's bill.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich branded it a ''very liberal,
big-government'' measure. Sen. Trent Lott, the majority leader,
called it a ''big spending bill'' even as he let debate play out on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   This week the Republican pollster Linda DiVall and her polling
firm, American Viewpoint, produced a new poll reporting that only
22 percent of those surveyed thought supporters of the tobacco bill
were mainly interested in cutting teen smoking, while 69 percent
said the supporters wanted to get additional tax revenue for the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The firm advised that ''the power of the teen smoking issue can
be completely overwhelmed when recast as a message where the
candidate places a higher priority on cracking down on illegal drug
use and addressing juvenile violence and enforcing the law against
retailers who illegally sell cigarettes to minors.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Wednesday vowed to keep the tobacco legislation
alive by attaching it again and again to other, unrelated
legislation. ``This bill may be dead. But tobacco legislation is
not dead,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader.``We will
not let this issue die. We will come back. We will keep at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic worked two years ago on a minimum wage increase. But
that was a much simpler, more clearcut issue.
</P>
<P>
   So it is more likely that the battle over tobacco will live on
this year only as an issue in the fall campaign. And despite
Republican confidence, there were signs that the Democrats may very
well still be able to make headway on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Asking different questions from Republican pollsters, the
nonpartisan Pew Research Center recently found wide public support
for government efforts to regulate the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut of Pew said the vote on Wednesday ``is certainly
not risk free but it's not guaranteed as a poison pill either.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Wednesday's outcome risk free for the tobacco industry,
which remains in a legal limbo. Cigarette makers still face
lawsuits from 37 state attorneys general and six of those cases
have been set for trial over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, some talks have begun between industry
officials and lawyers representing those states aimed at reaching
possible settlements. But one industry lawyer said that those
talks, which he described as ``feelers,'' were still at the very
early stage.
</P>
<P>
   One industry official said on Wednesday that tobacco companies
might seek to bring forward a new tobacco bill in the next session
of Congress that is more to their liking. But this hope may ignore
the lessons of recent political history. After all, Clinton's
health care proposal never did recover.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    Ask Salvadorans about their country's future prospects and they
will tell a story about the past. In the 1970s, Texas Instruments
came here to set up an electronics plant to supply microchips for
the U.S. manufacturer's computer products. Within six months, the
story goes, previously inexperienced line workers reached
productivity levels that a similar plant in Singapore had taken
three years to attain. Texas Instruments' Salvadoran operations
became a gemstone in the company's global supply system, with
dexterous, dedicated employees producing the highest quality chips
at unmatched speed.
 &HT;    Then came the civil war. As violence escalated in what would
become Central America's bloodiest conflict during the 1980s, Texas
Instruments pulled up stakes and headed for more peaceful climes,
never to return.
 &HT;    Salvadorans hold out this anecdote to explain what could have
been. Twenty years ago, El Salvador was Central America's economic
leader, with the region's most promising economy led by banking,
manufacturing and coffee. That vision of Salvador crumbled as
communist Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN)
forces and the traditional ruling elite battled for control of this
small nation. Now, six years after a historic peace agreement, the
economy is heading back to the future.
 &HT;    A stable currency, minimal inflation and steady growth has
brought stability, and the public and private sector are ready to
build on that foundation, intent on returning El Salvador to the
center of Central American trade and finance.
 &HT;    This year's privatizations will focus much-needed positive
attention on a country that many foreign investors mistakenly
believe is still at war. Already, the state-owned electrical
distribution system has been divided into four regions and sold for
US$586 million to companies from Chile, the United States and
Venezuela. The new private pension system, Central America's first,
has lured heavyweights such as Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, U.S.
Citibank, Chilean pension funds Provida and AFP Magister and the
International Finance Corporation, a branch of the World Bank.
 &HT;    New opportunities over the next few years will center around
sectors that have been modernized and transferred to private
operators, with growth coming from new investment and the
development of related activities. But the groundwork has been laid
for El Salvador to compete as a regional center for industries
across the board. ``We are convinced that the only way to increase
wealth is to create jobs,'' says Economy Minister Eduardo Zablah.
``For that, we must have investment, and the only way to attract
investors is to reduce operating costs in this country.''
 &HT;    Since the peace accords, the government has been controlled by
the center-right, pro-business Alianza Republicana Nacionalista
(ARENA) party, led first by former President Alfredo Cristiani and
now by President Armando Calderon Sol. Cristiani's administration
focused on fiscal reforms that paid off in a successful monetary
policy that led to a rock-steady exchange rate that has remained on
track for the last four years, with inflation hitting
industrialized-nation levels of just 2 percent last year.
 &HT;    Moody's and Standard &AMP; Poor's, the two main international
ratings agencies, have responded in kind, awarding El Salvador with
some of the strongest investment-grade ratings in the region _ just
below Chile, but on par or above the much larger economies of
Argentina, Colombia, Mexico and Uruguay. The agencies also comment
on the country's ``broad-based support for economic reform'' and
``successful transition to stability and sustained growth.''
 &HT;    The private sector is even more generous. ``Maybe it's the size
of the place, but there's a transparency here you don't find in the
rest of Central America,'' says mining entrepreneur Robert
Johansing. ``Things move faster. People take an idea and put it to
work and you find out quickly whether it will be profitable.'' That
can-do attitude spreads from the factory floor, a la Texas
Instruments, to the highest management levels. Private-sector
leaders seem to understand the reality of free trade and
globalization better than many of their regional counterparts, due
in large part to El Salvador's small market. With the country's
population of only 5.9 million, its companies have looked abroad
for years to expand the market.
 &HT;    Plans for economic growth _ from privatization to industry to
the creation of an international service sector _ hinge on the
country's ability to capitalize on this global vision and to lure
investors and companies that share it. ``We don't consider Central
America an export. That's our local market,'' says Roberto Polomo,
president of Salvadoran shoe manufacturer ADOC. ``There's a lot of
work going on here in preparing for globalization.''
 &HT;    As stabilization was the hallmark of the Cristiani
administration, privatization and deregulation will mark the
presidency of Calderon Sol. Even as national elections loom on the
horizon, the president has succeeded in working with FMLN
opposition in keeping this year's main slate of privatizations on
target. This should boost the country's investment inflow from last
year's disappointing $25 million in registered investment to over
$1 billion in 1998. More important, the reforms leading up to the
sales of state holdings in power and telecommunications set the
stage for free competition once assets are transferred to private
ownership. Add the new private pension funds' ability to generate
local capital sources, and Calderon Sol has staked out his legacy.
``These three privatizations are the concrete achievements ... this
government wants to leave behind,'' says Americo Hidalgo, an
advisor to the Presidential Commission on Modernization.
 &HT;    A strong showing in electrical distribution privatizations has
set the pace. Venezuela's Electricidad de Caracas, Chile's Emel and
AES of the United States bid a total of $586 million against a
strong field to take control of 80 percent of four public
distribution companies. Private generation of power for sale to the
national grid has been allowed for several years, but only one
company, U.S.-based Coastal Corp., operates a plant. Following the
privatizations, all three new distributors are racing to develop
their own generating capability. The prize is the period before
four inefficient state generators are privatized and re-engineered,
a process that could take several years. Meanwhile, the cost of
power will remain regulated and relatively high. The distributors
are betting they can bring new plants on line to operate at half
the cost, and thus return artificially high margins over the short
term. Power development is basically a capital-raising and
cash-flow game, making the proposition attractive to investors,
while plans over the longterm call for supplying electricity to
neighboring countries, an activity already contemplated under the
regulatory code.
 &HT;    State-owned telecommunications company Antel was expected to
bring more than $500 million in late May. Unlike privatizations in
other countries, El Salvador already allows free competition in
fixed-line and cellular operations. Currently, cellular operations,
long distance and other value-added services such as Internet
services and radio communications are offered on the open market,
while two companies have started offering wireline service. New
regulations demand interconnectivity between competing providers;
lower rates set the stage for international consolidation. Main
opportunities exist in creating local networks in rural areas
beyond Antel's reach and focus and making a bid in the
international telecom service industry.
 &HT;    Antel made $600 million last year on sales of $2 billion. Growth
at up to 20 percent a year is forecast, with pent-up demand for
lines topping 1 million, triple current capacity. Demand for
business lines is so tight that a side market in line-expanding
technology _ creating four or eight virtual hookups where only one
exists _ flourishes.
 &HT;    A bigger prize is the ability to compete for the U.S./Salvador
international traffic, the fifth-largest such market in Latin
America. In minutes per capita, Salvadorans connect to the United
States more than any country in the region save the Dominican
Republic. ``This will become the telecom center of Central America,
given the type of laws we have and the interconnection agreements
in place,'' says CTE/Antel president Dr. Juan Jose Daboub. ``Not
only do you get El Salvador's 5 million callers, you get the rest
of Central America and the Caribbean's 35 million people. And El
Salvador and the Dominican Republic have more international traffic
volume than Argentina, Brazil or Mexico.''
 &HT;    Buoyant Salvadorans say capitalizing on this reality will launch
a booming regional telecom industry, with local operators
collecting connection charges to complete calls through the
Americas and budding entrepreneurs building on low rates to create
all manner of international calling centers, telephone help centers
and customer-service support operations for multinationals working
in English and Spanish.
 &HT;    The local banking industry has already created its own regional
network; Salvadoran banks are the biggest, healthiest banks in
Central America. Led by Banco Cuscatlan and Banco Agricola
Comercial de El Salvador, they are now taking ownership in
neighboring countries. Peru's Banco de Credito has also moved in,
buying out Banco Capital to get its toe in the region.
 &HT;    Until last year, Citibank was the only foreign bank in El
Salvador. But since then, investment bankers are arriving in
droves. ``They just keep coming,'' says Citibank vice president
Maria Alicia de Espinoza.
 &HT;    The recent advent of the private pension fund system will add
new fire to an already bubbling pot. In the next five years, the
five authorized funds are expected to generate $500 million in
capital. The funds, which must be invested locally, will radically
relocate the stocks and bonds market, as well as corporate finance.
``You'll see Salvadoran companies start to go public in three
years,'' says Roberto Ulloa, Barclay's chief representative in
Central America. ``There is not much sophistication in terms of
risk right now. That will change.''
 &HT;    Industry will welcome capital sources. While the maquila plants
have flourished under tax preferential treatment, many local
operations are struggling to rebuild plants and make investments to
upgrade machinery following the war. Locally produced products are
suffering mightily against the onslaught of low-duty imports.
However, the maquilas, mainly stitch-and-ship textile plants, are
leading the export sector and are the country's main success story,
with weekly shipments going out to the biggest names in global
fashion.
 &HT;    Many plants are locally owned, a fact that Salvadorans say
shelters them from a normally cutthroat, unpredictable industry.
Indeed, labor is pricier here and the main market, the United
States, is easier served by other countries. However, the
government has plans to extend the almost expired 10-year tax
exemption indefinitely and to redefine the rules to allow other
industries to operate in free zones and sell to other Central
American markets, as well as liberalizing movement in and out of
tax-free zones. But Salvadorans insist that their maquilas are
different. ``We don't sell cheap labor,'' says David Huezo, special
projects director for box and bag exporter Sigma. ``Countries by
the dozen offer that. We offer high labor skill, quality and
confidence.''
 &HT;    Trade pacts are an important factor for the maquilas and the
rest of the regionally focused economy. Central America has its own
free-trade agreements in place, but El Salvador needs more to keep
moving forward. Mexico is the prize closest at hand, with Economy
Minister Zablah predicting that a
Guatemala/Honduras/Salvador/Mexico free-trade agreement will be in
place by year end. Discussions with Caribbean nations are underway,
too, but Salvadorans figure they will be ready for a
hemisphere-wide trade area when it comes, and all the current
effort has that as its goal.
 &HT;    Next year's presidential elections represents a hurdle that is
much closer on the horizon. The FMLN opposition holds a strong
congressional contingent and currently controls the mayorship of
San Salvador, the capital. The coming contest will be a tight race,
but most businesspeople say that while the unknown is always cause
for some worry, they don't see an FMLN president making an economic
about-face. Says one banker, who asked not to be identified, ``It's
not like `the commies' are coming. Those days are over. Before,
there was a lot of political fighting and hardly any dialogue. Now
there is still a lot of fighting, but by the end of the day they
all get together for a drink. That's democracy at its best.''
 &HT;    And perhaps the best indicator that El Salvador will stay on
track toward a new economic future.

   LOS ANGELES _ Cal State Northridge's football program will get a
hand from former coaches Terry Donahue and John Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-UCLA and ex-USC football coaches are the subjects of
roast benefiting the Matadors. The semi-formal event, which will
also have a silent sports memorabilia auction, is Aug. 7 at the
Warner Center Marriott in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue, with a school-best 151-74-8 record, coached the Bruins
from 1976-95. His roast will be led by Jerry Long, UCLA's former
assistant athletic director in charge of development. Robinson
posted a 104-36-4 record in 12 seasons at USC. His roast will be
led by Craig Fertig, an ex-USC assistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of overwhelmed at the thought that they would come to
a dinner and be honored by us,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said.
``They are both humble and good people who are doing it for
Northridge's cause. It feels good that two coaching legends will
take time out to help the program. It's humbling for me and it
makes me feel good about what we're doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   The event begins at 6 p.m. and the cost is $125 per plate or
$2,500 for a corporate table of up to 10 people. Guests are asked
to RSVP in advance.
</P>
<P>
   For information call (818) 677-2061.
</P>
<P>
   __ Basketball schedule: The highlights of the Matadors' 1998-99
men's basketball season schedule are road games against UCLA and
Tennessee and two tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN, 0-3 overall against the Bruins, plays at Pauley Pavilion
on Dec. 19. Matadors coach Bobby Braswell, a former Oregon
assistant, will face his ex-boss, Volunteers coach Jerry Green, for
the first time at Tennessee on Nov. 17. Northridge is also playing
at Hawaii's Powerbar Tournament on Dec. 3-4 and the BYU Tournament
on Dec. 11-12.
</P>
<P>
   The season opener is Nov. 14 at Long Beach State, the home
opener is Nov. 28 against San Diego and the Big Sky Conference
opener is Jan. 2 against two-time league champion Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   __ Hectic schedule: Ponciano will rack up some frequent-flyer
miles in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The first-year coach is in Park City, Utah, on July 19 for the
three-day Big Sky Conference Football Media Kickoff. The next day,
Ponciano has a press conference at 9 a.m. and a flight back to Los
Angeles so he can attend the 11th Annual Matador Football Golf
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After the tournament at the Porter Valley Country Club, Ponciano
will fly back to Utah for another press conference on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all part of the deal,' said Ponciano. ``It is no
different than when I was an assistant during recruiting season
jumping out of cars and planes.''
</P>
<P>
   The golf tourney costs $175 per golfer and is a two-man
scramble. For information, call (818) 677-2061.
</P>
<P>
   __ Matadors honored: Track and field athletes Oswaldo Servin and
Jennifer Overlock were named Northridge's Big Sky Conference male
and female scholar athletes of the year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   To be nominated for the award, the athlete must have at least a
3.2 grade-point average, be a member of the graduating class, have
competed two years and be a letter winner.
</P>
<P>
   Servin holds CSUN's fifth-best time in the 3,000 meters
(8:32.65, 1997) and finished seventh in 1,500 meters in the Big Sky
Outdoor Championship in May. Overland, a graduate of L.A. Baptist
High, earned the school's third-best time in the mile (5:18.35,
altitude adjustment) in 1997.

NETS WILL STAND PAT ON THIS ROUND OF DRAFT PICKS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STEVE POPPER     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In recent years, the day of the National Basketball
Association draft has been a vital one for the Nets. With an annual
spot in the lottery, it usually turned out to be the most promising
day of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But in earning their first playoff berth since 1994 this year
with a young and talented roster, the Nets dealt away their picks
in this year's draft and they are not interested in joining in the
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Coach John Calipari will be vacationing with his wife next
Wednesday when the names are called. The Nets will not even send a
representative to Vancouver for the draft. Instead they will hire
on a former assistant coach of the Canadian national team for the
day to fill their seat at the table.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets traded away their first-round selection, No. 15 over
all, to the Orlando Magic in the deal to acquire Rony Seikaly, and
their second-round choice, No. 45 over all, went to the Los Angeles
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets see this year's draft crop as a weak one and they
believe that they have a strong team, so there is no need to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked these guys one thing,'' Calipari said, pointing toward
General Manager John Nash and Dave Pendergraft, the director of
player personnel. ``I said to Dave, `Is there a player in the draft
that can make us better, that if we traded for him, that he would
make us a better team?'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only reason you would do it. Is there someone there
that, not would make us better two years from now, I mean, right
now, who is going to make us better? And it was one or two guys
maybe. There was no definite, `this guy makes us better,' like
Keith Van Horn. We definitely knew he would make us better, so it
was, let's do what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So on Wednesday, Nash will be in the office, watching the phone,
but with little interest in listening.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' plan almost from the start of the season was to tie
the first-round pick in a package to Yinka Dare, trying to entice
someone to take his contract off their hands. Orlando took it and
the Nets have no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our scouts told me yesterday about a player he was
intrigued with, that he thought could possibly make an NBA
roster,'' Nash said. ``My question to him was, `Is he better than
David Vaughn right now?' He said, `No, not right now.' We have a
chance now to be a 50-win team. We're a playoff team and the real
mission is to get home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're picking 15th, you're hoping.''
</P>
<P>
   Calipari listed the players the Nets would have brought in to
consider if they retained that No. 15 pick, including Michael
Doleac, Van Horn's former teammate at the University of Utah,
Georgia Tech's Matt Harpring, Baylor's Brian Skinner, Arizona's
Michael Dickerson, Notre Dame's Pat Garrity, Florida's Jason
Williams, Mississippi's Ansu Sesay, Ball State's Bonzi Wells,
Cincinnati's Ruben Patterson, as well as high school players Al
Harrington and Rashard Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But Calipari insisted the Nets have no regrets about not adding
youth to their team. The concerns right now are re-signing the free
agents Jayson Williams and Sherman Douglas, seeing the team with
Seikaly healthy, and convincing Michael Cage to put off retirement
for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our veterans are young,'' Calipari said. ``I think next year
will be a good year to supplement because we will lose a lot of
these guys at this point. Guys will be at the end of contracts and
we can take a stab at that point. That's why we're scouting
European players. If we're playing well and winning, then our draft
picks are going to be worse and worse.'' &QL;

WILLIAM SCHWANN, 85, FOUNDER OF THE RECORD CATALOG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., N.H.)   (dc) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Schwann, an organist, musicologist and publisher who
started a record catalog in 1949 that became an indispensable
resource for browsers, collectors, musicians, critics and record
company executives, died on June 7 at the Lahey Clinic in
Burlington, Mass. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Since his retirement in 1985, he had been living in Lincoln,
Mass., with his wife, Aire-Maija, who survives him.
</P>
<P>
   Schwann's name has become as synonymous with record collecting
as the name of Baedeker is to travel and Bartlett is to quotations.
His reasons for starting the catalog were eminently practical. He
owned a store in Cambridge, across the street from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called simply ``The Record
Shop.'' At the time, long-playing records, which had been
introduced by Columbia the previous year, were being released so
quickly that Schwann had trouble keeping track of what was
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to protect myself from my bad memory,'' he said in an
interview in later years. So he assembled a list of all available
recordings, and typed it up, some 26 pages. ``This gave me the idea
of doing the catalog,'' he said. ``And since I had helped organize
a Boston record dealers association during the war, when shellac
was unavailable and records scarce, I had an immediate market for
my guide.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were 11 record labels with some 600 titles.
The first Schwann catalog, hand-typed and mimeographed, sold 11,000
copies. Within a month it was obsolete. So Schwann realized that he
would have to publish a new issue every month.
</P>
<P>
   By 1953, the demands of the catalog were so great that he had to
give up his record shop. Rumford Press in Concord, N.H., was
contracted to print the catalog using an offset process. Schwann
took on a staff, and eventually maintained information on a
computer database. When he sold the catalog in 1976 (although he
kept running it until his retirement), it had expanded to over 300
pages with over 40,000 listings.
</P>
<P>
   Compiling the catalog was often a nightmare of information
gathering, and the information kept changing. During his time,
Schwann saw the long-playing disk superseded by stereophonic
records, audiotapes and compact disks. Initially the catalogs
included sections for jazz and Broadway musicals, but Schwann never
claimed as much completeness in those listings, which were
eventually published separately. Trying to get clear answers from
rapidly changing record companies about what releases were in the
stores and available was exasperating.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1960s, the Schwann catalog was invaluable. Where
else, for just $1, the cost at the time, could one find a complete
listing of, say, the Beethoven piano sonatas, in order, with dates
of composition, opus numbers and all available recordings? As a
trained musicologist, Schwann was careful about facts but not
obsessive. Where scholars had formed a consensus about, say, the
chronology of the Mozart piano concertos, he drew on the latest
thinking. But where confusion remained, for example, the order of
the Haydn string quartets, he used the traditional and, he
acknowledged, questionable opus numbers.
</P>
<P>
   William Joseph Schwann was born on May 13, 1913, in Salem, Ill.,
the son of the Rev. Henry W. and Effie A. Schwann. He attended the
Conservatory of Music at the University of Louisville, earning a
bachelor's degree in 1935. During these years he worked as an
organist and choir director. He later moved to Boston, where he did
graduate work at Harvard and Boston University, and studied organ
with E. Power Biggs.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th-anniversary issue of the catalog in 1979 was filled
with congratulatory messages from luminaries like Aaron Copland and
Isaac Stern. Schwann received many awards, including honorary
doctorates from the University of Louisville and the New England
Conservatory.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the catalog was sold to Stereophile. Today,
the Schwann Opus catalog, as it is called, is owned and published
quarterly by Valley Media in New Mexico, and regularly runs over
1,000 pages.

CHINESE SUDDENLY IMPROVED ROCKET LAUNCHES, EXPERT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  
 (ATTN: S.C., Mo., Calif.)   (See also CHINA-U.S.-SATELLITE, scheduled to move at 9:30 p.m.
ET)

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A simple, one-page chart presented Wednesday
captured the essence of Congress' inquiry into whether sensitive
U.S. space technology was illicitly slipped to Chinese rocket
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The chart, offered at a House hearing by Henry Sokolski, who was
the Pentagon's top expert monitoring proliferation during the Bush
administration, showed that between 1990 and 1996, one in four
Chinese rockets carrying commercial satellites blew up. But since
1996, the Chinese have had a perfect record: 10 consecutive
successful launches.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No failures in the past 10 launches,'' Sokolski mulled aloud.
``Is that a coincidence or is it the result of cumulative
technology transfers?''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and witnesses voiced diverse opinions in response to
Sokolski's rhetorical question, but offered no definitive answers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet the timing of China's new-found success in launching
multimillion-dollar satellites into orbit was striking. It was in
mid-1996 that two U.S. satellite makers _ Loral Space &AMP;
Communications and Hughes Electronics _ helped Chinese engineers
figure out why a satellite launching failed in February 1996. The
Justice Department is conducting a criminal inquiry to determine
whether the two companies breached U.S. national security. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reliability of Chinese rockets is important because the
missiles that send U.S. communications satellites into orbit are
very similar to the Chinese missiles that carry nuclear warheads.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rare joint hearing of two committees, International Relations
and National Security, Wednesday opened the House's inquiry into
this issue as well as into whether the Clinton administration's
shift of satellite-licensing authority in 1996 to the Commerce
Department from the State Department loosened controls over
sensitive technology.  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Partisan overtones hung over the hearing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's track record in this regard displays a
single-minded determination to evade sanctions and to ignore or
downplay national security concerns in the interest of exporting
sensitive U.S. technology in the name of `engagement' with China,''
said Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., who heads the National Security
Committee.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the same
panel, responded, ``We need to get the facts first about matters
that affect the national security of this country.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wednesdy's hearing set the stage for what is expected to be a
volatile day Thursday, when senior State, Commerce and Defense
department officials will defend the administration's export
control policies in back-to-back House and Senate hearings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the House is to vote Thursday to create a special
select committee that will lead the House inquiry into the China
accusations. Democrats grumble that existing House committees,
including the two that held Wednesday's hearing, are capable of
handling the broader inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared by the House Democratic Policy Committee,
which will be made public Thursday, accuses House Republicans of
spending $17 million on 50 ``politically motivated'' investigations
since Republicans took control of the House in 1995.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's hearing, Sokolski, citing information on Chinese
rocket reliability obtained from a Singapore-based web site, Dragon
in Space, that tracks Chinese commercial satellite launches, said
he had no doubt that U.S. space technology that helped Beijing's
military arsenal had been transferred to China. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Joan Johnson-Freese, a professor of international security
studies at the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama
said these assertions were based on ``half-facts that have been
distorted and sensationalized.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers immediately dismissed the professor as
naive. ``The blueprints for all these changes were not left under
their pillow by the tooth fairy,'' said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher,
R-Calif.

 Por DOUGLASS STINSON 
 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN SALVADOR _ Pregunten a los salvadorenos sobre las
perspectivas de su pais y les contaran una historia del pasado. En
los anos 70, la estadounidense Texas Instruments monto alli una
planta de microprocesadores para sus computadoras. En seis meses,
segun la historia, trabajadores que no tenian experiencia
alcanzaron el nivel de productividad que los empleados de una
planta similar en Singapur habian alcanzado en tres anos. Las
operaciones salvadorenas de Texas Instruments se convirtieron en
una joya del sistema de suministros internacionales de la compania,
con empleados habiles y dedicados que producian chips de la mayor
calidad a una velocidad sin igual.
 &HT;    Entonces estallo la guerra civil. Al aumentar la violencia en el
que seria el conflicto mas sangriento de Centroamerica en los anos
80, Texas Instruments levo anclas y se traslado a lugares menos
convulsos, para no volver jmas.
 &HT;    Los salvadorenos cuentan esta anecdota para explicar lo que pudo
haber sido. Hace veinte anos, El Salvador era el lider economico de
Centroamerica; tenia la economia mas prometedora de la region,
impulsada por la banca, la manufactura y el cafe. Esa vision de El
Salvador se derrumbo cuando las fuerzas comunistas del Frente
Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN) y la clase
dominante tradicional se enfrentaron por el control de la pequena
nacion. Ahora, seis anos despues de un historico acuerdo de paz, la
economia apunta de nuevo hacia el futuro.
 &HT;    La estabilidad de la moneda, una inflacion minima y un
crecimiento constante han fomentado la estabilidad, y los sectores
publico y privado estan preparados para crecer sobre esa base, con
el proposito de devolver a El Salvador al centro del comercio y las
finanzas centroamericanas.
 &HT;    Las privatizaciones de este ano se concentraran en llevar una
necesitada atencion positiva a un pais que muchos inversionistas
extranjeros creen erroneamente que sigue en guerra. Ya el sistema
estatal de distribucion electrica se ha dividido en cuatro regiones
y se ha vendido por US$586 millones a companias de Chile, Estados
Unidos y Venezuela. El nuevo sistema privado de pensiones, el
primero de Centroamerica, ha atraido a pesos pesados como el Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya, de Espana; Citibank, de Estados Unidos, los fondos
chilenos de pensiones Provida y AFP Magister, y la Corporacion
Internacional de Finanzas, rama del Banco Mundial.
 &HT;    En los proximos anos las nuevas oportunidades se centraran en
sectores que se han modernizado y transferido a operadores
privados, con un crecimiento procedente de inversiones nuevas y del
desarrollo de actividades afines. Pero ya se han sentado las bases
para que El Salvador compita como centro regional de industrias de
los mas diversos sectores. ``Estamos convencidos de que la unica
forma de incrementar la riqueza es creando empleos,'' dice Eduardo
Zablah, ministro de Economia. ``Por eso hace falta la inversion, y
la unica manera de atraer a los inversionistas es reduciendo los
costos operativos en este pais.''
 &HT;    Desde el acuerdo de paz, el gobierno ha estado controlado por la
Alianza Republicana Nacionalista (ARENA), partido de centroderecha,
proempresarial, dirigido primero por el ex presidente Alfredo
Cristiani y ahora por el presidente Armando Calderon Sol. El
gobierno de Cristiani se concentro en reformas fiscales que dieron
lugar a una exitosa politica monetaria. Esta politica a su vez
fomento un tipo de cambio solido que se ha mantenido estable
durante los ultimos cuatro anos, con un nivel de inflacion de solo
2 por ciento el ano pasado, similar al de las naciones
industrializadas.
 &HT;    Moody's y Standard &AMP; Poor's, las principales entidades
internacionales de calificacion de credito, han respondido en
consonancia al otorgar a El Salvador una de las mejores
calificaciones de grado de inversion en la region, justo por debajo
de Chile, pero a la par o por encima de economias mucho mayores
como Argentina, Colombia, Mexico y Uruguay. Las entidades tambien
se refieren al ``vasto apoyo para la reforma economica'' en el pais
y a ``la exitosa transicion a la estabilidad y el crecimiento
sostenido.''
 &HT;    El sector privado es aun mas generoso. ``Quiza sea por el tamano
del pais, pero aqui hay una transparencia que no se ve en el resto
de Centroamerica,'' afirma el empresario minero Robert Johansing.
``Las cosas se mueven mas rapido. La gente toma una idea y la pone
en marcha y uno se da cuenta enseguida si sera rentable.'' Esa
actitud de confianza se extiende desde la fabrica estilo Texas
Instruments hasta los mas altos niveles gerenciales. Los lideres
del sector privado parecen entender la realidad del libre comercio
y la globalizacion mejor que muchos de sus colegas de otros paises
de la region, debido en gran medida a que el mercado de El Salvador
es pequeno. Como la poblacion es de solo 5,9 millones de
habitantes, las companias salvadorenas llevan muchos anos buscando
en el extranjero la expansion de su mercado.
 &HT;    Los planes de crecimiento economico (desde la privatizacion y la
industria hasta la creacion de un sector de servicios
internacionales) giran en torno a la capacidad del pais de
aprovechar su vision global y atraer a los inversionistas y a las
empresas que comparten esa vision.
 &HT;    ``No consideramos a Centroamerica un mercado de exportacion. Es
nuestro mercado local,'' dice Roberto Polomo, presidente de ADOC,
empresa salvadorena de produccion de calzado. ``Tenemos mucho
trabajo con vistas a la globalizacion.''
 &HT;    Del mismo modo que la estabilizacion fue el sello del gobierno
de Cristiani, la privatizacion y la desregulacion marcaran la
presidencia de Calderon Sol. A pesar de la cercania de las
elecciones nacionales, el presidente ha logrado la cooperacion del
partido de oposicion, el FMLN, para mantener en marcha el programa
de privatizaciones de este ano. Este logro debe hacer aumentar la
entrada de inversiones, de los decepcionantes US$25 millones del
ano pasado, a mas de US$1.000 millones en 1998. Mas importante aun,
las reformas que conducen a la venta de propiedades estatales de
energia y telecomunicaciones preparan el terreno para la libre
competencia una vez que los activos pasan a manos privadas.
Agreguese la capacidad de los nuevos fondos privados de pensiones
para generar fuentes de capital local, y Calderon Sol ha cimentado
su legado. ``Estas tres privatizaciones son los logros concretos
... que este gobierno quiere dejar,'' dice Americo Hidalgo, asesor
de la Comision Presidencial de Modernizacion.
 &HT;    Un vigoroso programa de privatizaciones del sector electrico ha
marcado el paso. Electricidad de Caracas, de Venezuela; Emel, de
Chile, y AES, de Estados Unidos, ofrecieron en la licitacion un
total de US$586 millones en una fuerte competencia para adquirir el
control del 80 por ciento de cuatro empresas de distribucion de
electricidad. Desde hace varios anos se permite la generacion
privada de electricidad para la venta a la red nacional, pero solo
una empresa, Coastal Corp., de Estados Unidos, opera una planta.
Tras las privatizaciones, los tres nuevos distribuidores se
apresuran por desarrollar su propia capacidad generadora. El premio
es el periodo anterior a la privatizacion y reorganizacion de
cuatro ineficientes generadoras estatales, proceso que podria
tardar varios anos. Entretanto, el costo de la energia seguira
regulado y relativamente alto. Los distribuidores apuestan a que
pueden contar con plantas nuevas que operen a la mitad del costo, y
asi obtener margenes de ganancia artificialmente altos a corto
plazo. El desarrollo de la energia es basicamente una actividad de
acumulacion de capital y flujo de efectivo, una proposicion
atractiva para los inversionistas, mientras hay planes a largo
plazo que proyectan suministrar electricidad a los paises vecinos,
actividad que ya contempla el codigo normativo.
 &HT;    Se esperaba que la empresa estatal de comunicaciones Antel
aportara mas de US$500 millones en mayo. A diferencia de las
privatizaciones en otros paises, El Salvador ya permite la libre
competencia en operaciones de telefonia de linea fija y celular.
Actualmente, las operaciones celulares, de larga distancia y otros
servicios de valor agregado, como el acceso a la Internet y las
comunicaciones radiales, se ofrecen en el mercado abierto, mientras
dos companias han comenzado a ofrecer servicios de lineas fijas.
Las nuevas regulaciones exigen una interconectividad entre
proveedores rivales; las tasas mas bajas preparan el terreno para
la consolidacion internacional. Hay grandes oportunidades en la
creacion de redes locales en zonas rurales a donde Antel no llega y
en las licitaciones en el sector de las telecomunicaciones
internacionales.
 &HT;    Antel tuvo ganancias de US$600 millones el ano pasado sobre
ventas de US$2.000 millones. Se pronostica un crecimiento del 20
por ciento anual, con una demanda reprimida de lineas telefonicas
que supera un millon, el triple de la capacidad actual. La demanda
de lineas comerciales es tan alta que ha hecho florecer un mercado
paralelo de tecnologia de expansion de lineas, que crea cuatro u
ocho conexiones telefonicas virtuales donde existe solo una.
 &HT;    Un premio mayor es la capacidad de competir por el trafico
internacional entre Estados Unidos y El Salvador, el quinto mercado
mas grande de su tipo en America Latina. En minutos per capita, los
salvadorenos se conectan con Estados Unidos mas que cualquier pais
de la region, excepto Republica Dominicana. ``Este sera el centro
de telecomunicaciones de Centroamerica, teniendo en cuenta el tipo
de leyes que tenemos y los convenios de interconexion que se han
sellado,'' afirma el presidente de CTE/Antel, Juan Jose Daboub.
``No solo estan los 5 millones de usuarios de El Salvador, sino
tambien el resto de los 35 millones de habitantes de Centroamerica
y el Caribe. Y El Salvador y la Republica Dominicana tienen mas
volumen de trafico internacional que Argentina, Brasil y Mexico.''
 &HT;    Los salvadorenos prosperos dicen que aprovechar esta realidad
impulsara un floreciente sector regional de telecomunicaciones,
donde los operadores locales cobren cargos de conexion para hacer
llamadas a traves de las Americas y flamantes empresarios utilicen
las bajas tarifas para crear todo tipo de centros de llamadas
internacionales, centros de ayuda telefonica y operaciones de apoyo
de servicio al cliente para las multinacionales que trabajan en
ingles y en espanol.
 &HT;    La banca local ya ha creado su propia red regional; los bancos
salvadorenos son los mayores y mas saludables de Centroamerica.
Encabezados por el Banco Cuscatlan y el Banco Agricola Comercial de
El Salvador, ahora adquieren activos en paises vecinos. El Banco de
Credito de Peru tambien ha entrado en la palestra regional con la
compra del Banco Capital.
 &HT;    Hasta el ano pasado, Citibank era el unico banco extranjero en
El Salvador. Pero desde entonces los banqueros de inversion llegan
por legiones. ``Entran constantemente,'' dice Maria Alicia de
Espinoza, vicepresidenta de Citibank.
 &HT;    La reciente creacion de los fondos privados de pensiones
aumentara la presion en una caldera que ya esta al rojo vivo. En
los cinco anos proximos, se espera que los cinco fondos autorizados
generen US$500 millones en capital. Los fondos, que deben
invertirse en el pais, relocalizaran radicalmente el mercado de
bonos y valores, asi como las finanzas empresariales. ``Veremos a
las empresas salvadorenas cotizandose en bolsa en tres anos,''
asegura Roberto Ulloa, principal representante de Barclay en
America Central. ``No hay mucha sofisticacion en terminos de riesgo
en este momento. Eso cambiara.''
 &HT;    La industria dara la bienvenida a las fuentes de capital. Aunque
las maquiladoras han florecido gracias a un tratamiento fiscal
preferencial, muchas operaciones locales se esfuerzan por
reconstruir fabricas y hacen inversiones en mejoramiento de equipo
tras el fin de la guerra. Los productos locales sufren
considerablemente bajo el empuje de las importaciones con aranceles
bajos. Pero las maquiladoras, esencialmente fabricas textiles de
costura y exportacion, estan a la cabeza del sector exportador y
constituyen la mayor historia de exito del pais, con embarques
semanales de los nombres mas celebres de la moda mundial.
 &HT;    Muchas plantas son de propiedad local, lo que segun los
salvadorenos las protege de un sector generalmente implacable e
impredecible. En efecto, la mano de obra es mas costosa en El
Salvador, y su principal mercado, Estados Unidos, halla un servicio
mas facil en otros paises. Sin embargo, el gobierno planea extender
indefinidamente la exencion fiscal de 10 anos, ya a punto de
vencerse, y redefinir las regulaciones para permitir que otras
industrias operen en zona francas y vendan a otros mercados
centroamericanos, asi como liberalizar el movimiento de entrada y
salida en zonas francas. Pero los salvadorenos reiteran que sus
maquilas son distintas. ``No vendemos mano de obra barata,'' indica
David Huezo, director de proyectos especiales de Sigma, exportadora
de cajas y bolsas. ``Eso lo ofrecen muchos paises. Nosotros
ofrecemos mano de obra de gran habilidad, calidad y confianza.''
 &HT;    Los pactos comerciales representan un factor importante para las
maquilas y para el resto de la economia concentradas en la region.
Centroamerica ha sellado sus propios acuerdos comerciales, pero El
Salvador necesita mas para seguir avanzando. Mexico es el trofeo
mas cercano. Zablah, el ministro de Economia, pronostica que este
ano se firmara un pacto de libre comercio entre Guatemala,
Honduras, El Salvador y Mexico. Tambien se negocia con paises
caribenos, pero los salvadorenos piensan que estaran preparados
para un area de libre comercio hemisferico cuando llegue el
momento, y todos los esfuerzos actuales tienen ese objetivo.
 &HT;    Las elecciones presidenciales del ano proximo representan un
obstaculo mas cercano. La oposicion del FMLN tiene una vigorosa
presencia parlamentaria y controla la alcaldia de la capital, San
Salvador.
 &HT;    Las proximas elecciones seran renidas, pero la mayoria de los
empresarios opina que aunque lo desconocido siempre es causa de
cierta preocupacion, no creen que un presidente del FMLN de un giro
economico de 180 grados. Dice un banquero que pidio no ser
identificado: ``No es como si regresaran los comunistas. Esos
tiempos han pasado. Antes habia muchos enfrentamientos politicos y
casi ningun dialogo. Ahora hay muchos enfrentamientos, pero al
final de la jornada todos se reunen para tomar un trago. La
democracia funciona mejor que nunca.''
 &HT;    Y quiza el mejor indicador de que El Salvador mantendra el rumbo
hacia un nuevo futuro economico.

 c.1998 Latin Trade 
 (Distribuido por New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SAN SALVADOR _ Pregunten a los salvadorenos sobre las
perspectivas de su pais y les contaran una historia del pasado. En
los anos 70, la estadounidense Texas Instruments monto alli una
planta de microprocesadores para sus computadoras. En seis meses,
segun la historia, trabajadores que no tenian experiencia
alcanzaron el nivel de productividad que los empleados de una
planta similar en Singapur habian alcanzado en tres anos. Las
operaciones salvadorenas de Texas Instruments se convirtieron en
una joya del sistema de suministros internacionales de la compania,
con empleados habiles y dedicados que producian chips de la mayor
calidad a una velocidad sin igual.
 &HT;    Entonces estallo la guerra civil. Al aumentar la violencia en el
que seria el conflicto mas sangriento de Centroamerica en los anos
80, Texas Instruments levo anclas y se traslado a lugares menos
convulsos, para no volver jmas.
 &HT;    Los salvadorenos cuentan esta anecdota para explicar lo que pudo
haber sido. Hace veinte anos, El Salvador era el lider economico de
Centroamerica; tenia la economia mas prometedora de la region,
impulsada por la banca, la manufactura y el cafe. Esa vision de El
Salvador se derrumbo cuando las fuerzas comunistas del Frente
Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN) y la clase
dominante tradicional se enfrentaron por el control de la pequena
nacion. Ahora, seis anos despues de un historico acuerdo de paz, la
economia apunta de nuevo hacia el futuro.
 &HT;    La estabilidad de la moneda, una inflacion minima y un
crecimiento constante han fomentado la estabilidad, y los sectores
publico y privado estan preparados para crecer sobre esa base, con
el proposito de devolver a El Salvador al centro del comercio y las
finanzas centroamericanas.
 &HT;    Las privatizaciones de este ano se concentraran en llevar una
necesitada atencion positiva a un pais que muchos inversionistas
extranjeros creen erroneamente que sigue en guerra. Ya el sistema
estatal de distribucion electrica se ha dividido en cuatro regiones
y se ha vendido por US$586 millones a companias de Chile, Estados
Unidos y Venezuela. El nuevo sistema privado de pensiones, el
primero de Centroamerica, ha atraido a pesos pesados como el Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya, de Espana; Citibank, de Estados Unidos, los fondos
chilenos de pensiones Provida y AFP Magister, y la Corporacion
Internacional de Finanzas, rama del Banco Mundial.
 &HT;    En los proximos anos las nuevas oportunidades se centraran en
sectores que se han modernizado y transferido a operadores
privados, con un crecimiento procedente de inversiones nuevas y del
desarrollo de actividades afines. Pero ya se han sentado las bases
para que El Salvador compita como centro regional de industrias de

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was more backslapping euphoria in the City
Council chambers on Tuesday than anyone who has slept through its
meetings could remember. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani described the
session as something closer to a party convention than a gathering
of a legislative body, and though he was not actually in the room
to see his budget vetoes overridden, he basically got it right.
</P>
<P>
   As each of the council's 44 Democrats rose to vote against the
mayor, there was enthusiastic cheering from the gallery, and when
each of the seven Republicans voted with him, there was
melodramatic hissing. The way-outnumbered Republicans talked grimly
about the dire consequences of the day. The Democrats, meanwhile,
hailed it as a great moment for the city and an even greater one
for the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I am proud to be a City Council member,'' announced
Priscilla Wooten, D-Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very proud to be a member of the City Council,'' declared
Adolfo Carrion, D-Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, with this override, we are fulfilling the mandate we
have as a legislature,'' asserted Guillermo Linares, D-Manhattan,
his voice rising for dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   Even factoring in the natural inclination of politicians to
grandstand, Tuesday's vote to override the vetoes marked a
significant victory for the council _ a victory, to be sure, mostly
over its own fabled pusillanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Since the revised City Charter gave the council substantial new
powers in 1989, its members have been extremely chary of exercising
them. Instead, they have spent more energy complaining that they
needed yet another round of charter revision before they could ever
dream of providing a check on executive authority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Tuesday's vote demonstrated, the council already
possessed the power to write the city's budget and, thanks to its
huge Democratic majority, was in a position to easily override
Giuliani's vetoes. The mayor can talk tough about countering the
council's ``irresponsible'' action, but it will be difficult and,
in some cases, downright impossible for him to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has broad authority to hold back funds that the
council has approved, but he has no authority to spend money that
the council has not approved. Nor can he, on his own, impose taxes.
Thus the centerpiece of the council's budget _ its elimination of
the personal-income-tax surcharge, worth about $500 million a year
_ will, no matter how much the mayor barks and bites, go into
effect in January.
</P>
<P>
   Both critics and defenders of the council give essentially the
same account of why it has taken so long for it to flex its
charter-given muscles. Every legislative body has its written rules
and then its unspoken traditions. In the case of the council, these
traditions all pointed in the direction of street-naming and
favor-mongering. Not so terribly long ago, the council was compared
unfavorably by one of its very own members with a rubber stamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``A rubber stamp at least leaves an impression,'' Henry Stern,
who is now the city's parks commissioner, once opined.
</P>
<P>
   For four and a half years, Giuliani has helped keep this craven
tradition alive by treating the City Council with a finely tuned
disdain. The few times the council has dared to differ with him,
the mayor has first heaped scorn on it and then ignored it. On more
than one occasion, he has simply refused to form commissions
established by the council or to seat board members that it had
selected.
</P>
<P>
   But with Tuesday's vote, the mayor's relation to the council has
entered a new phase. Thanks to an unlikely concatenation of events,
which include the battle over Yankee Stadium, this year's huge
budget surplus and council Speaker Peter Vallone's gubernatorial
ambitions, the council members have at last tugged free of the
Slough of Despond. And having tugged free, who knows where they
could end up?
</P>
<P>
   After the vote to override the vetoes, several members insisted
that they had no plans to retreat. ``In the future,'' said
Councilman John Sabini, D-Queens, ``we may be cooperative, but
rolling over _ it ain't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the situation from a slightly different angle, Gene
Russianoff, a senior attorney at the New York Public Interest
Research Group, suggested that the council might not have much
choice in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is going back,'' he said. ``They won't
be able to say, `We can't do it because the mayor is too powerful.'
People will say, `You can do it; you did do it.'''

POISE AND PATIENCE WILL BE KEYS TO WINNING THE U.S. OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whenever the U.S. Open has come to the Olympic
Club, something unexpected and memorable has happened.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the elements seem aligned for another unpredictable
tournament. Casey Martin will make history, becoming the first
player in a U.S. Open to compete riding in a golf cart.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els will defend his title with an ailing back, but he
still hopes to become the first player since Curtis Strange in 1989
to repeat as champion.
</P>
<P>
   There will be veteran players enjoying a renaissance, such as
Tom Watson, competing against young players like David Duval, who
are eager to add a major championship to their collection.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the course, picturesque yet challenging. The
5-inch rough, sloping fairways, deceptive wind and small greens
will reward patience, magnify mistakes and make it difficult for
any player to separate himself from the field. Three-under par won
the U.S. Open in 1987, the last time it was held at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is potential disaster at every hole,'' said Colin
Montgomerie, who has come close to winning the U.S. Open three
times. ``You can make double or triple at any hole, any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Will one of the game's prominent names add the Open to his
resume? Or will another unlikely champion emerge at Olympic,
joining Jack Fleck (1955), who defeated Ben Hogan, Billy Casper
(1966), who overtook Arnold Palmer, or Scott Simpson (1987), who
defeated Tom Watson?
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, when the first threesome tees off at 7 a.m. Pacific
time, four days of golf at its most demanding will begin. Here is a
look at some of the key factors that will determine the victor:
</P>
<P>
   _ PATIENCE. Bogey-free rounds will be almost impossible. You
will see players hacking away in the rough. You will see four-putts
on Olympic's quick greens, which will measure 11 on the Stimpmeter.
You will see frustration. Players who shrug off mistakes quickly
and regroup will have an advantage. This is an area in which Els
has excelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm super cool out there, I get angry just like
anybody else,'' Els said. ``But you have to play the tournament
shot by shot. When you've made a bogey, don't get too hard on
yourself. Par is a good score.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods became impatient during last year's U.S. Open at
Congressional, and it cost him. On several occasions, Woods tried
to overpower shots out of the deep rough, leading to another bad
shot, and a bogey or worse. That has fueled talk that Woods does
not have the game to win another major tournament, talk that he
wants to end this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger has heard that, and believe me, he is motivated for this
tournament,'' said Butch Harmon, Woods' coach. ``Tiger is an
aggressive player, but patience is the key to this tournament for
him. I think you'll see his maturity as a golfer. He realizes how a
few bad holes cost him last year, not only at the United States
Open, but at the British Open. He has worked hard to eliminate
those kinds of holes. To win here, you have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ACCURACY. Length off the tee is not a huge advantage at
Olympic, which only measures 6,797 yards, compared to
Congressional's 7,213 yards last year. The rough, the tree-lined
fairways, doglegs on several holes, and the small greens will force
players to aim at small target areas, from off the tee and on
approach shots. Many people expect Watson, Montgomerie and Tom
Lehman to do well, because they are very accurate from tee to
green.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Montgomerie believes that Olympic's lack of length will
take away some of his advantage, and bring more players into
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year at Congressional, it was length and accuracy,''
Montgomerie said. ``But here, it's just accuracy. I hit my 3-wood a
long way and straight, so that was an advantage at Congressional.
But here, you can use a lot of 2-irons and 3-irons off the tee to
position yourself in the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Players who can hit high tee shots that drop onto the fairway
without rolling far will have an advantage, because Olympic's
slanted fairways will propel shots that are overcooked into the
rough.
</P>
<P>
   _ POISE. Something unexpected always happens at the U.S. Open,
so you have to deal with it. Montgomerie had three great rounds at
Congressional last year, 65-67-69, but a second-round 76 cost him
dearly. He lost concentration during that round when some rowdy
fans annoyed him. Those are the types of things that contenders
have to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday night, barring an 18-hole playoff on Monday, one
player will emerge as the person who avoided the most trouble, who
handled adversity the best, who made the most crucial shots. It
won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, I look back and say, `Man, how did I ever win
that tournament,''' Simpson said. ``It still kind of validates you
as a player.'' &QL;

2 may be only 
the beginning 
for Red Wings
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WASHINGTON _ With an unblemished record of eight consecutive
victories in the last two Stanley Cup finals, a 50-22 playoff
record since 1995 and a youthful core of key players locked into
contracts for next season, is it too early to think about a dynasty
for the Detroit Red Wings?
</P>
<P>
   Bowman
</P>
<P>
   Scotty Bowman, who has coached dynasties in Montreal in the
1970s and has coached against teams like the New York Islanders and
Edmonton Oilers in the 1980s, thinks it's premature to speak of the
Red Wings in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult talking about dynasties nowadays in our
sport, the kinds of overpowering teams we used to see go through
the 80-game regular season finishing first overall and then winning
Stanley Cups,'' the Red Wings' coach said. ``I don't think you can
call a team like ours a dynasty. I don't think that's what you're
talking about. I think this is a team with a lot of resiliency.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowman might be selling his team short. The Red Wings completed
a sweep of Washington this week to capture their second straight
Stanley Cup. Over the last two years, they are 32-10 in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit is the first team to repeat as champion since the
1991-92 Pittsburgh Penguins and the first to record back-to-back
sweeps since the 1982-83 Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   But will success spoil the Red Wings? General manager Ken
Holland understands that keeping a successful team together these
days is often tougher than building it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a difficult thing these days to keep a team
together,'' Holland said. ``Not only because of trades, free agency
and increasing salaries, but it can be difficult just to keep
everyone happy.''
</P>
<P>
   With one notable exception, the Red Wings demonstrated little
selfishness this season.
</P>
<P>
   They finished third overall in points while playing all year
without their top defenseman (Vladimir Konstantinov, injured in a
car accident after last year's title) and most of the year without
top offensive threat Sergei Fedorov, who was holding out.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantinov's career is over, but Fedorov returned in February
and will remain with the Red Wings for the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve Yzerman is 33 but showed no signs of slowing down,
winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff most valuable player.
Yzerman cites the fact that most of the Red Wings' top players are
still in the prime of their careers as the main reason he doesn't
see a drop-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apart from myself and Igor (Larionov), the majority of our
forwards are 22 or 23 to 29,'' Yzerman said. ``That will keep the
team competitive for a number of years. Our guys are relatively
youthful, so I expect we'll stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   Fedorov (27), Martin Lapointe (24), Slava Kozlov (26), Tomas
Holmstrom (25), Brendan Shanahan (28), Darren McCarty (26), Kirk
Maltby (25), Nicklas Lidstrom (28) and goaltender Chris Osgood (25)
fall into that category.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only Red Wings who are not signed for next season
are veteran defensemen Slava Fetisov (40) and Bob Rouse (34).
</P>
<P>
   In a league that was dominated by a handful of teams for the
last 13 seasons, it could be that Detroit is on the verge of
joining Montreal (1976-79), the Islanders (1980-83) and Edmonton
(four titles between 1984-88) as the next dominant team.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman, however, cautions against trying to compare the Red
Wings with the Islanders or Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders were led by superstars Mike Bossy, Brian Trottier
and Denis Potvin. The Oilers of the mid-1980s, possibly the best
team ever assembled, had Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier, Jari Kurri,
Kevin Lowe and Paul Coffey.
</P>
<P>
   Yzerman doesn't believe the Red Wings stack up against those
teams just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be competitive for a number of years, but the Oilers in
the '80s, they could put probably the six best players in the world
on the ice at one time,'' Yzerman said. ``We can't match the number
of superstars they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we do have is depth. All four of our lines are
solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Another strength is Bowman, who won his record-tying eighth
Stanley Cup as a coach this season.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman, 64, said he has not decided whether he will return. He
says he will wait a few weeks and talk with his family before
making a decision about coaching again. He has hinted he might not
be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing Scotty and his passion for the game and his
unbelievable energy level, I think he'd be bored silly by the
middle of December if he wasn't coaching,'' Holland said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Yzerman: ``Personally, I hope he comes back. He's in charge
of the team, and the players have grown extremely fond of him. He's
the guy who drives the team and puts the fire in the team.

EDITORIAL: DEATH OF THE TOBACCO BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   By killing tobacco-control legislation that would have helped
curb teen-age smoking, the Republicans in the Senate have shown
that they simply cannot wean themselves from tobacco money.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that would have raised cigarette prices and increased
federal authority to regulate tobacco ads was approved by the
Senate Commerce Committee 19 to 1. But during four weeks of debate
Republicans demanded one amendment after another, threatening to
kill the bill at every turn. They succeeded in larding it with
unrelated elements such as a tax cut for married couples, new
anti-drug programs and a cap on attorneys' fees for lawyers who sue
the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, asserted repeatedly that
without those concessions there would be no bill. Yet on Wednesday
he criticized the bill for having grown like Topsy, completely
ignoring the fact that Republican amendments contributed to the
situation he was deploring.
</P>
<P>
   In a final bit of chicanery, he orchestrated procedural votes
that effectively killed the bill even though a majority favored it.
The Republicans refused to vote on the legislation's merits,
because they fear that the voters want tough tobacco controls.
Instead they hope to hide their allegiance to the tobacco industry
by shelving the bill on technical grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Their craven performance, however, will not be forgotten by
voters in the election season. The fact remains that the tobacco
industry profits from youth smoking and the Republicans gave in to
a powerful special interest that contributes millions to their
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Democrats are successful in resuscitating key parts
of the legislation, controlling the industry's actions will depend
on state and private lawsuits. On that front there is reason for
optimism. The $6.1 billion settlement reached between the tobacco
industry and the state of Minnesota, and a recent court victory by
an individual smoker in Florida, show that the industry will have a
hard time denying its responsibility for the human and financial
costs that smoking places on society.
</P>
<P>
   The industry has also settled with Florida, Texas and
Mississippi for a total of nearly $30 billion in damages. Dozens of
other states are prepared to litigate against the industry, a task
that has been made easier by the trove of incriminating documents
uncovered in the Minnesota lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Although states will have less power than Congress to regulate
tobacco advertising, they can make a difference. The Minnesota
settlement, for example, will prohibit cigarette billboard ads and
promotional productions. A congressional failure to act will mean
that this public-health fight devolves to the states and to the
courts.

PLAYING GOOD GOLF WITH A REAL HANDICAP
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JACK CAVANAUGH     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. _ David Meador had just run in a five-foot
putt on the second hole at the Mount Kisco Country Club and the
rattling of the ball in the cup prompted Otto Huber to say, ``Music
to my ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Meador smiled at the remark by his playing partner because he
realized that, although neither he nor Huber could see the ball go
into the cup, they could certainly hear it. And sounds, and not
sights, are what count in golf to Meador and Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the 16 golfers entered in the Ken Venturi Guiding
Eyes Classic _ which raises money for Guiding Eyes for the Blind,
the organization that trains guide dogs for the blind _ saw where
any of their shots went during the one-day tournament last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop the winner, Keith Melick, from shooting a
110 over the challenging Mount Kisco course to give him his third
victory this year on the U.S. Blind Golfers Association circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Melick may have benefited from the absence of Pat Browne Jr.,
who had won the tournament the last 17 years in a row, including
last year when he carded a 99. Acknowledged for years as the
world's best blind golfer _ his low score as a blind golfer was a
remarkable 74 at the Mission Hills Country Club in Rancho Mirage,
Calif., in 1982 when he shot in the 70s on four consecutive days _
Browne missed this week's tournament because he is recovering from
rotator cuff surgery.
</P>
<P>
   With Browne on the sideline, Meador was the favorite. A
50-year-old life insurance salesman from Nashville who was a
5-handicap until an auto accident cost him his sight in 1966,
Meador won the U.S. Blind Golfers Association championship in 1977.
But he had finished second behind Browne every year since to earn
the unofficial title of ``second best blind golfer in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not to be his year, either. Meador, despite the
smoothest swing in the tournament, finished third with a 114.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a growing circuit that now includes tournaments in
Canada, Europe, Australia and Japan, the 16 players in the Venturi
Guiding Eyes Classic are among the best blind golfers in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the ultimate team game,'' Meador said before starting his
round, during which his coach, Everett Davis, guided him around the
course and lined him up before every shot.
</P>
<P>
   Davis placed the club in Meador's hands, pointed it in the
direction of where he wanted Meador to hit his next shot and then
put the clubface behind the ball. On the green, Davis, like most
other coaches, walked off the distance from the ball to the hole
before setting him up for his putt.
</P>
<P>
   For players on the U.S. Blind Golf Association circuit, coaches
are all-important. ``I sometimes think a coach, like mine, Kevin
Sullivan, can be 90 or 95 percent of your game as a blind golfer,''
Bill McMahon said on Tuesday while hosting his own annual charity
tournament at Shorehaven Golf Club in East Norwalk, Conn., which
has raised more than $100,000 for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   At Mount Kisco, Bob Andrews held onto the hand of his wife,
Tina, as, in her capacity as his coach, she led him around the
course and drove their golf cart. As the current president of the
association, Andrews _ who lost his sight when a booby-trapped
grenade blew up in his face when he was a 22-year-old Marine
corporal in Vietnam _ publishes the organization's newsletter,
``Midnight Golfer,'' and maintains a data base of all of the
association's members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play the same game, with the same USGA rules, as sighted
players do,'' Andrews said. ``It's all very competitive, but we
have a lot of fun and there's a wonderful camaraderie among the
players.'' &QL;

   U.S. AND JAPAN BUY YEN TO BOLSTER FALLING CURRENCY
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Japan bought yen to stop the precipitous
fall of the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
   The action, which took currency markets by surprise, marks the
first time in six years that the United States has sold dollars and
purchased yen. President Clinton said he approved the move after
speaking by telephone with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto of
Japan, who committed to specific economic reforms that go beyond
earlier pledges.
</P>
<P>
   As currency trading resumed in Asia, many wondered how committed
Japan was to making far-reaching economic changes. But there are
precedents for a turning point in the direction of the yen.
</P>
<P>
   AOL PLANS TO REMAIN INDEPENDENT
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of merger talks with AT&AMP;T, America Online said it
planned to remain independent. Investors had speculated that the
Internet access provider might be acquired and had pushed shares of
America Online up. The negotiations also indicate that the new
chairman of AT&AMP;T, Michael Armstrong, wants to bolster the
telecommunications company's Internet access and growth prospects.

   SENATE JETTISONS TOBACCO BILL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate jettisoned broad tobacco legislation meant to
discourage teen-agers from smoking. The bill, which had been
debated for a month, was set aside when supporters could not get
the 60 votes needed to clear two procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY REMAINS STRONG, FED SAYS
</P>
<P>
   The United States' economy remains strong, with employment high
and inflation low, despite scattered spillover from Asia's economic
ills, the Federal Reserve Board said in its survey of regional
economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   IT'S JOBS AT ISSUE IN GM STRIKE
</P>
<P>
   The strike at two General Motors' parts plants seems to be
centering on the transfer of jobs overseas. Striking employees say
they are walking the picket line to protect their jobs. But GM says
it needs to reduce costs further, perhaps by hiring nonunion and
overseas labor at lower-cost plants.
</P>
<P>
   NO UNANIMITY IN THE EXECUTIVE SUITE
</P>
<P>
   Chief executives and their top lieutenants hold widely divergent
views on issues like succession and training for the top job, a
survey by the Association of Executive Search Consultants shows.

<P>
   Q: Why do baseball managers wear uniforms? _ W.W., Denton, Tecas
</P>
<P>
   A: It appears that the tradition began because most early
managers of pro teams also were players.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the first pro team, Harry Wright of the
Cincinnati Red Stockings, was a pitcher and outfielder. More
recently, managers Pete Rose and Frank Robinson played for the
teams they led.
</P>
<P>
   A few managers broke from tradition and wore street clothes, but
that hasn't happened since the 1950s. According to an April 4,
1988, ``Sports Illustrated'' article, the last two were Connie Mack
of the Philadelphia A's and Burt Shotton of the Brooklyn Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Grapette soda pop still being bottled? _ J.M., Arlington,
Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Leading Edge Flavors returned the soda to production six
months ago in Temple after purchasing the franchise rights from the
Monarch Co. in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The grape-flavored drink made its debut in 1939 at a Camden,
Ark., bottling plant owned by B.T. Fooks. Monarch acquired the
rights in 1979 and produced it in limited quantities.
</P>
<P>
   Grapette is sold in 20-ounce plastic bottles and will be
available in longneck glass bottles in August, said Eileen Langford
of Leading Edge.
</P>
<P>
   The soda is distributed in Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana and New
Mexico. To find out where, call (800) 335-2353.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have about 50 really old Matchbox toy cars. How do I find
out if they're worth anything? _ J.B., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: There are several collectors' clubs you can start with; one
of the largest is Matchbox USA, with 1,500 members.
</P>
<P>
   Matchbox USA publishes a monthly magazine for collectors and
holds a yearly convention. A one-year membership costs $27 to $34.

TOBACCO BILL DIES IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate abruptly killed comprehensive
antitobacco legislation last night, halting a historic attempt to
crack down on the cigarette industry and creating a powerful issue
in this year's congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The $516 billion plan, built from a blueprint drawn nearly one
year ago in a landmark settlement between the tobacco industry and
40 state attorneys general, died of procedural causes after
supporters were unable to defeat two parliamentary moves by Senate
Republican leaders to scuttle it.
</P>
<P>
   A motion to force a final vote on the measure fell three votes
short of the 60 that supporters needed, 57-42, even though 15
Republicans broke with GOP leaders who called for killing the bill.
All the Democrats except two from tobacco-growing states voted for
the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The measure expired moments later when supporters failed to
secure the 60 votes needed to waive a Senate rule that would have
permitted the plan to exceed last year's balanced budget agreement.
The vote was 53-46, seven votes shy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who had called on Congress to use last year's
tobacco settlement as the framework for curbing youth smoking,
immediately cast the setback as an election issue. He blamed the
bill's demise on Republican congressional leaders and ``$40 million
in unanswered advertising by their allies'' in the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was seen by members of both parties as one of the
most iportant issues Congress would take up this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that when the American people understand fully what
has been going on, they won't like what they see,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the 57 votes to keep the bill alive, Clinton said the
number ``clearly shows that a bipartisan majority supports tough
legislation to protect the children of this country from tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's death was expected to provide fresh momentum for
lawsuits pending against the tobacco industry in 36 states.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican and the bill's
sponsor, joined Clinton in blaming the tobacco industry's
advertising blitz for turning public opinion against the bill. He
said the campaign caused a number of senators who once supported
the plan to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   Six Republicans who voted for the measure when it passed the
Senate Commerce Committee 19-1 in April, voted last night to kill
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there has been a change of view by many members,''
McCain said. ``The only conclusion one can draw is that the tobacco
advertising campaign had a significant impact on their
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, which cast the antitobacco measure as one of
the most regressive tax-and-spend boondoggles in decades, was seen
as providing crucial support to a small group of Republican foes
who succeeded in killing the bill after four weeks of rancorous
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The ads ``were like cruise missiles equipped with nuclear
bombs,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat.
``They work every time in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats vowed to use every parliamentary tool they can
to keep the issue on the legislative agenda, even though House
Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he will not allow the
Republican-controlled House to use the Senate bill as the basis for
a legislative compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans may mug this bill in the Senate, but they
cannot kill it,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy said moments before the
parliamentary votes. ``We will not let it die.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is backing much narrower legislation aimed at curbing
youth smoking and drug abuse, a measure that public health
officials have called severely inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to reduce teen smoking, not increase taxes,''
Gingrich said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, the Democratic point man on the
antitobacco bill, assailed Senate GOP leaders for failing to defy
Gingrich's desire for a less ambitious measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich put out a contract on this bill,'' Kerry said,
``and the Republicans in the Senate are the hit people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kennedy's vow to revive the issue, GOP leaders,
including McCain, said the Democratic minority will not be able to
overcome Republican opposition to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader,
denounced the bill as an unsalvageable ``tax and spend'' plan.
``We've lost sight of the original noble cause of just dealing with
teen-aged smoking and drug abuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was among the 15 Republicans who broke with Lott and
voted not to kill the bill. Every New England senator voted to keep
the measure alive except for Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The only New England senators who opposed the other
parliamentary, balanced-budget maneuver were Smith and Senator Judd
Gregg, also a New Hampshire Republican. That vote effectively
returned the bill to the Senate Commerce Committee, which the
chairman, McCain, said was tantamount to killing it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have required the tobacco industry to pay
billions of dollars over 25 years to help states and the federal
government bear the medical costs of smoking-related illnesses. The
measure also would have raised cigarette taxes by $1.10-a-pack over
five years, expanded the Food and Drug Administration's power to
regulate the tobacco industry and drastically restricted cigarette
advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the cigarette tax hikes, which the bill
required tobacco companies to pass on to consumers, were an unfair,
economic assault on the 60 percent of smokers who earn less than
$30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for the Republican Party as to
whether or not we are going to have a massive tax increase and
expansion of big government,'' said Senator John Ashcroft, a
Missouri Republican and leading opponent of the bill. ``We should
not become the party of massive taxes on low-income workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican foes succeeded in amending the bill to provide $27
billion in relief for low-income couples who pay a marriage tax
penalty. Several other Republican amendments passed as well,
including a provision that would have used $17 billion on the
tobacco money for antidrug initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Repulicans who pushed for those changes voted
not to allow a final vote on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the senators who derailed this bill lose sleep every
night listening to the sound of children taking their first puff
and the sound of emphysema and cancer patients gasping for their
last breath,'' said Dr. C. Everett Koop, a former surgeon general.

   Hughes officials wanted ``an expedited handling'' of the waiver
to meet a contractual deadline, O'Neal said. And recently released
White House documents show that the company hoped to have the
president sign off on the deal before the company's chairman left
China on June 19, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The memorandum from his staff that the president relied on to
approve the deal made no mention of the Loral-Hughes help a few
months earlier for China's rocket program. Three weeks before the
memorandum to the president, the State Department had alleged, in a
letter to Hughes, that there had been a violation of the arms
export control law during the rocket accident review.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The president granted the waiver on June 23.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the presidential action, Hughes received a license to
export a satellite. Later that summer, Hughes applied for another
export license that would allow Shen Jun, the son of Gen. Shen, to
work on projects subject to United States export controls,
including the APMT project, O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We applied for and received an export license that allowed him
to participate as a translator in the APMT preliminary design
review,'' O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Shen was hired in 1994 by Hughes for his computer expertise,
though the company was also aware of his family ties before he
joined the company, O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether federal agents knew about Shen's family
background when they approved the license for his involvement in
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Shen has been involved in the APMT project as the overseer
of the Chinese launch and tracking company and his son has given
Hughes marketing advice about China and technical advice about
mobile telephone networks, Liu and a Hughes executive said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said he had no comment on the Shen family discussions
because ``anything he said to his dad is personal.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the flurry of activity in mid-1996 between Hughes
and APMT, the deal bogged down amid internal squabbles. But by this
year the pace had picked up again and last month the consortium
reorganized itself and signed another deal with Hughes for an
upgraded satellite.
</P>
<P>
   The new satellite will have greater power to transmit and
receive signals. Its payload includes a large-scale antenna
reflector made out of gold mesh and a digital-on board processor,
Liu and O'Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   The antenna and processor enable the consortium's network to
pinpoint low-power hand-held phones and simultaneously handle
16,000 phone conversations. Liu said that the regional affiliates
``will be able to intercept calls if required by local
authorities'' but the consortium will not be able to intercept.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the recent corporate reorganization, the
consortium is now two-thirds owned by its Chinese affiliate, China
APMT, said Liu, the consortium's deputy president. APMT is based in
Singapore, the home of its minority stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   China APMT, in turn, is owned by the same five Chinese entities,
including the Costind unit, and it will be the local APMT franchise
in China.
</P>
<P>
   The president of APMT and China APMT is Li Baoming and APMT's
chief engineer is Feng Ruming. Liu said both men have senior posts
with the China Satellite Launch and Tracking Control Corporation,
the unit of Costind overseen by Gen. Shen. American intelligence
reports say Feng and Li are top military officers, according to
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said that Hughes was ``not aware'' of APMT's military
ties and while ``there could be'' some, it was up to the federal
government to vet those connections. That is precisely what is now
happening.

ADMINISTRATION RETHINKING $650 MILLION CHINA SATELLITE DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also U.S.-CHINA-MISSILE) 
(ps) 
 By JEFF GERTH c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with growing criticism of its satellite
exports to China, the Clinton administration is rethinking whether
to allow one of the biggest sales to date, a $650 million deal
President Clinton quietly approved two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said the Pentagon and State Department are
raising new questions about whether a Chinese-controlled company
with close ties to China's military should be allowed to buy the
satellites, which contain some of this country's most sophisticated
communications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The satellites are the cornerstone of a commercial mobile phone
network planned for China and 21 other Asian nations. American
officials said their design includes a powerful antenna that could
eavesdrop on mobile phone calls in China or other countries in the
region. It could also be used by the Chinese military to transmit
messages through hand-held phones to remote parts of China.
</P>
<P>
   Antennas of these dimensions are a mainstay of America's and
Russia's eavesdropping satellites and have not previously been
exported to China, though a sale to the United Arab Emirates is
pending. They also can be used to extend the range of mobile phones
used commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves next week for China, and the administration had
hoped to use the trip to showcase a variety of business deals and
agreements, including enhanced cooperation on civilian satellite
and rocket projects.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said concerns about the pending
satellite sale had been deepened by American intelligence reports
about Chinese Army Gen. Shen Rongjun, who oversees his country's
military satellite programs. The reports quote the general as
saying he was planning to emphasize the role of satellites in
gathering information.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual arrangement, Hughes Space and Communications hired
Shen's son, a dual citizen of Canada and China, to work on the
project as a manager. The company said it was aware of his family
ties, but it is not clear whether the Clinton administration knew.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son were both directly involved in the project, and
American officials said the intelligence reports say the general
was pressing his son to move it forward.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported last week that the Chinese military
was sending many of its coded messages through American-made
commercial satellites sold to Asian companies. China's military
satellite network collapsed in 1996, when its first generation of
satellites wore out and the replacements failed to work as planned.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton approved the Hughes project on June 23, 1996,
after his advisers assured him the communications satellite
technology was readily available from European suppliers and would
not contribute to Chinese military capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   China already has a burgeoning cellular telephone system, which
relies on ground-based transmitters. There are almost 1.5 million
cellular phones in Beijing and Shanghai, but the system is less
developed in the country's more remote areas, industry officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Donald O'Neal, a spokesman for Hughes, said the satellites are
``inherently dual use,'' meaning that they have both civilian and
military potential. ``The satellite is not designed for military
application,'' he said. ``But I don't know how you can prevent
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government could still stop the deal. O'Neal says
Hughes is waiting for the Commerce Department to review its
application to sell the satellite to the Asian consortium, APMT or
Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Tsun Kie, a spokesman for the consortium said in a telephone
interview from Singapore, that the telephone satellite network
would be marketed to civilians by regional telecommunications
operators. It would be up to regulators in China, he said, to
decide if the Chinese military could use the satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Liu predicted the Clinton administration would eventually
approve the deal. ``In view of the improving Sino-American
relationship, as well as the close rapport established between the
U.S. satellite industry and major industry leaders in China and the
Asia Pacific,'' he said, ``we are confident that APMT will obtain
all the necessary approval and export license to insure no delay in
satellite launch.''
</P>
<P>
   Making a satellite sale to China involves two crucial steps that
occur simultaneously. Aerospace manufacturers must persuade the
president to sign a waiver of the sanctions imposed on Beijing
after the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989. Each project requires
a separate waiver.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, companies apply to government agencies for
permission to export specific technologies used in the satellites.
Satellite exports to the Chinese military are banned, but sales to
Chinese companies are generally allowed, unless they would
significantly advance military development in areas like
intelligence gathering and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton granted the waiver for the Hughes project two years ago
and the company obtained the necessary export licenses. Since then,
however, Hughes has changed the design to enhance the satellite's
capabilities, requiring it to seek a new license.
</P>
<P>
   That decision is now before a panel headed by the Commerce
Department and including officials from the Pentagon, State
Department, the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and the
Department of Energy. Each department casts a single vote, with the
decision made by majority rule. A dissenting agency can appeal to
the president, but that has never happened in the two-year history
of the interagency process.
</P>
<P>
   A Commerce Department spokesman declined to discuss the case,
saying it involved confidential business information.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Commerce Department officials are arguing the deal
should go forward because the design approved in 1996 is
substantially the same as the current configuration proposed by
Hughes, administration and Congressional officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Pentagon and State Department officials believe the
license should face more scrutiny in light of the new information
about Shen and the capabilities of the satellite. Administration
officials also said that the increased scrutiny by Congress of the
Chinese military and American satellites has prompted officials pay
closer attention to exports to China.
</P>
<P>
   Several congressional committees are investigating whether the
policies on technology exports hurt the national security. The
House recently voted to ban future satellite exports to China, and
the Senate is scheduled to take up similar legislation soon.
</P>
<P>
   The issue turns on highly technical questions. An administration
official who disagrees with the Commerce Department's analysis said
the Hughes design is substantially different from what was approved
two years ago. ``The antenna sent up the flags,'' the official
said. ``It is more powerful than what we have licensed before.''
</P>
<P>
   The antenna allows the satellite to receive incoming signals.
But a sophisticated antenna, like the one currently under review,
can become a listening device that is very effective, government
reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1996, the Pentagon could easily have stopped the license,
because satellites were treated as military items and subject to
State Department authority. That year President Clinton shifted
jurisdiction to the Commerce Department, easing the controls and
lessening the influence of the Pentagon, a senior government
auditor told Congress earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   APMT was organized in the early 1990s. Most of its stock was
held by five Chinese state-owned entities: China Satellite Launch
and Tracking Control, a unit of Costind, the scientific and
research arm of the Chinese military; the China Aerospace
Corporation, part of the defense-industrial complex; China Resource
Holdings, a trading company that owns a bank in Hong Kong with the
Riady family of Indonesia, and subsidiaries of the electronics and
telecommunications ministries. A small stake was held by a
Singaporean company.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1996, the consortium authorized Hughes to proceed
with the design and construction of a massive mobile satellite
telecommunication network that would span 22 countries in Asia and
the Pacific, from Pakistan to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   China's own space program was then under severe strain.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese rocket exploded shortly after liftoff in February. Two
months later, engineers from Hughes and Loral Space and
Communications were brought in by insurers and China Aerospace to
help figure out what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The conversations that ensued between the companies and Chinese
technicians are now the subject of a criminal investigation, which
is seeking to determine whether American export laws were violated.
Both companies deny wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   While China was trying to repair its rocket program, its
satellites began to fail. The first generation of domestically
produced satellites, launched by the Chinese military in the early
1990s, were wearing out, and the first replacement, built in
cooperation with the German company Daimler-Benz, had failed to
achieve proper orbit after its 1994 launch.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, all this led China's most senior military
official, Gen. Liu Huaqing, to discuss his concern that year with
Shen, who until a recent reorganization was a senior Costind
official and oversees China's satellite and rocket launching
programs, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   General Shen and General Liu have publicly promoted satellite
technology as crucial to the future development of China's military
capabilities. General Shen has privately assured his colleagues
about his ability to fix China's satellite problems and improve the
military's surveillance and intelligence-gathering capabilities,
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time, there were urgent concerns within Hughes
and its APMT partners over the how long it was taking President
Clinton to make a decision about the deal, O'Neal and American
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial satellite exports to China have been banned since the
killings in Tiananmen Square in 1989, but the president can waive
the prohibition, which Presidents George Bush and Clinton have done
20 times.

US TRIES TO BOLSTER THE YEN, EASE FEAR OF WIDENING CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States made an unusual foray into the
currency markets Wednesday, selling dollar reserves in an attempt
to prop up the Japanese yen and calm fears that Japan's sinking
economy would prompt a worldwide financial downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The move, the first US effort to raise the yen in six years,
came after the Japanese government promised new measures to revive
its economy, which has slid into recession. Early results suggest
that the US intervention was providing Japan at least some
short-term relief. The yen rose from the eight-year low against the
dollar set earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   US investors cheered the move by bidding the Dow Jones
industrial average up 164 points to close at 8829.46. The Dow had
fallen 207 points on Monday on fears of an expanding Asian
financial crisis, and it had risen only modestly on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, the 225-share Nikkei average, the nation's main
stock market barometer, jumped 3.20 percent, or 470.83 points, to
15,186.21 Thursday morning in the first 20 minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very smart move by the United States,'' said C.
Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International
Economics, a research group. ``We were getting to the point where
global financial crisis was really possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The falling yen has cut the price of Japanese steel, computer
chips and electronics on the world market, alarming nations that
sell the same products. Companies that export to Japan are also
finding it difficult to sell their own goods because the purchasing
power of the yen is weak.
</P>
<P>
   From South Korean to Russia and Brazil, countries are under
pressure to devalue their own currencies so that they can compete
with Japan. But cheaper currencies would make it harder for them to
pay off the dollar-denominated foreign debts they have accumulated
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for Japan and the United States to prop up the yen have
been particularly strong in China, where President Clinton is to
visit next week. China has so far resisted devaluing its own
currency in response to the sagging yen.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton said he supported the US
plan to sell yen after Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
promised in a Tuesday evening phone call to make ``aggressive''
economic reforms, including steps to deal with the country's
weakened banks, which are saddled with bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very encouraged by the prime minister's statement that
he intends to pursue aggressive reform of their banking
institutions and intends to do the things that were necessary to
get their economy going again,'' Clinton said, ``and therefore I
thought it was important that we support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve hold authority to
trade US reserves, and they made the decision jointly, US officials
said. The Treasury said it acted ``in cooperation with the monetary
authorities of Japan,'' which private currency traders said meant
that the Bank of Japan had also bought yen.
</P>
<P>
   US officials would not discuss the value of dollars that had
been sold by the United States and the Bank of Japan to buy yen,
and estimates from private currency traders ranged from $2 billion
to more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hearing that it could be $15 billion, but no one really
knows, because central banks don't discuss these things,'' said
David Warren, a London-based portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price
international funds.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has drawn wide criticism for failing to take steps to end
its eight-year economic stall. The criticism has turned to alarm as
the yen lost about 10 percent of its value against the dollar this
year, suggesting that Japan would be unable to lead Asia out of its
financial crisis by buying products from troubled neighbors like
Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has promised to close or merge banks
that have been weakened by bad loans, but few large banks have
actually shut their doors. Hashimoto also has proposed a $115
billion tax cut to spur consumer spending, but some critics say the
amount is not nearly enough and note that the plan remains stuck in
the Japanese parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, some analysts said they had little faith that Japan
was finally ready to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hashimoto didn't say the wrong thing, but he's saying the same
things that have been said before, with no greater specificity,''
said Gary Hufbauer, research director of at the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York. ``There's a lot of market skepticisim that
he will carry through real reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts warned that the US currency intervention by
itself would have little long-term effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a currency intervention work unless the
fundamentals were also in line...and Japan is not taking action to
get them in line,'' said Ronald Reuss, chief economist at Piper
Jaffray Cos., a Minneapolis stock brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Hufbauer said the US currency intervention, and the prospect
that it would buy yen again if necessary, would take pressure off
the Japanese currency for a month or so. ``But if Japan does not
deliver on the tax cuts, skepticism will grow back in, say, late
July or August,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hufbauer echoed many other analysts who believe that Japan's
banking crisis is at the core of its economic downturn. ``They need
to restructure like we did in the 1980s'' with the savings and loan
crisis, said Hufbauer, who speculated that Japanese banks are
carrying $500 billion in bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts have put the bad loans at half that amount, or
equal to 10 percent of Japan's gross domestic product. The US
government spent $153 billion in direct costs to clean up savings
and loan losses, or about 3 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   The air of alarm over Japan comes as the US economy is booming.
Only last week, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress that the economy was the best he had seen in his 50-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   That stellar performance has come in part because the Asian
crisis is allowing Americans to buy foreign goods at low prices,
keeping US inflation low. However, Greenspan and others have warned
that Asia's woes could become more problematic. US companies could
find it harder to compete with low-priced Asian goods, and the
once-growing Asian economies now have little money to buy US
products.
</P>
<P>
   The US decision to begin selling dollars for yen marked an
abrupt change in government policy. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
had been downplaying the prospects that the US would help the
Japanese economy by propping up the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the Japanese government reported that the
country's economy had shrunk for the second quarter in a row,
meeting the traditional measure of a recession. Stock markets
around the world reacted this week with sharp downturns,
heightening fears that the Japan's problem would ripple beyond
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's trading of US reserves was handled by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, which is the Treasury's agent in the
currency market. One dollar bought 136.75 yen late Wednesday, down
4.4 percent from Tuesday's close of 143.18 yen, and also down from
Monday's mark of nearly 147 yen.
</P>
<P>
   In another apparent boost to the yen, Treasury announced that
Lawrence Summers, its No. 2 official, and New York Fed Bank
President William McDonough will go to Tokyo for a weekend meeting
of finance officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations.
Traders speculated that Summers would press the case that Japan
must follow through on plans to improve the economy.

EDITORIAL: A STRONG INTERNATIONAL COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   After decades of discussion and years of long and fractious
planning meetings, a permanent international criminal court to try
the likes of Pol Pot and Saddam Hussein is close to becoming a
reality. This week in Rome, representatives of 156 nations gathered
to write rules for a court, which will take the form of a treaty
for nations to ratify.
</P>
<P>
   They should not waste this opportunity to put international
muscle behind their rhetoric on punishing international crimes.
They should design an effective and independent court, and not give
in to nations such as the United States that want to cripple it.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's reservations, which come principally from the
Pentagon, stem from fears that a court will bring frivolous or
politically motivated cases against American soldiers, who are
stationed all over the world. Such concerns are important, but the
court's planners have addressed them. They decided that the court's
jurisdiction will not be invoked unless national systems of justice
are unwilling or too weak to deal with the crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Every indictment will also have to be confirmed by a panel of
international judges, in some cases two panels. The judges
themselves will be carefully chosen. Finally, by common consent,
only the gravest international crimes are likely to come before the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Washington has tried a variety of strategies to
weaken the court. Many countries, now including France, recognize
the need for an independent prosecutor who can decide that alleged
crimes in, say, Iraq or Kosovo need investigating. Washington wants
that decision made by the U.N. Security Council or by individual
countries, which are rarely willing to accuse each other.
</P>
<P>
   Another worrisome idea would require a nation's consent before
its own citizens could be prosecuted. This would give someone like
Saddam Hussein the power to block his own prosecution, a major step
backward from current international law. International support for
this position is eroding, but Washington is alarmingly silent.
</P>
<P>
   The United States may yet come around to supporting an effective
court. But if it does not, the court's planners should not weaken
it just to please the great powers. The Senate, which has been slow
to ratify many human-rights treaties, is not likely to approve the
court soon anyway, another reason not to tailor the plan to the
Pentagon's specifications.

 &HT;    Florida's hopes rest on arm of Bellisari
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Florida's Steve Bellisari is listed in the
Georgia-Florida High School All-Star
</P>
<P>
   Game program as a free safety. But Florida coach Robby Pruitt
has the final say-so, and he says it isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't touch the defensive side of the ball,'' Pruitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bellisari will start at quarterback Saturday, and the
6-2, 200-pound left-hander from Boca Raton plans to play that
position at Ohio State this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He throws the deep ball as good as I've seen,'' Pruitt said.
``He's a whole lot better than we thought. The first time we saw
him, it was like, `My God!'''
</P>
<P>
   Bellisari's passing proficiency has caused Pruitt to rethink his
offensive strategy for Saturday's game. Florida plans to use
Pruitt's specialty offense, the run-oriented wing-T formation, but
he said Wednesday he will also run ``four wideouts and some shotgun
stuff.'' Bellisari's bloodline would seem to dictate athletic
success. His brother, Greg, was an Academic All-American at Ohio
State and plays linebacker for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   Dogs and Gators galore
</P>
<P>
   The University of Georgia will have a noticeable presence in
Saturday's Georgia-Florida All-Star Game. There are 15 future
Bulldogs participating _ 13 from Georgia and two from Florida _ and
14 of them will start on Saturday. The only non-starter in the
group is Charlton County's Terin Smith, and he is backing up three
positions, both defensive end spots and tight end.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Florida has 11 signees in the game _ four from
Georgia _ and eight of them will start.
</P>
<P>
   Two Georgia signees will play very prominent roles. Tim Wansley,
who played quarterback at Buford High, will start ahead of Robert
Cromartie of Douglass at left cornerback and play split end on
offense. Wansley also might return some kicks. Several other
Georgia players will play multiple positions: Washington County's
Terrence Edwards (WR/QB), Brookwood's Ian Knight (TE/DT),
Parkview's Jim May (OL/DL), Wheeler's Lester Norwood (DB/WR),
Washington County's Jessie Miller (LB/DB) and Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like about our team is it's very versatile,''
Georgia coach Rodney Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Special assignment
</P>
<P>
   Being invited to the Georgia-Florida game even as a manager is a
special honor, particularly for Fort Valley's O.J. Barton. Barton,
a rising senior at Peach County High, was a late addition to Team
Georgia at the invitation of Walker. Laoria Barton, O.J.'s mother,
died of a brain aneurysm just three weeks ago. Raised in a
single-parent home, Barton had to move in with his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed to get his mind off things awhile and be around
people, so I asked him to come along,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton's not used to delivering water bottles. He gained 750
yards as a backup tailback for Peach County last fall and will
start this year.

 &HT;    Burns to carry on RB tradition at Georgia-Florida All-Stars
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Running backs often have stolen the spotlight in the
13-year history of the Georgia-Florida All-Star Football Game.
Garrison Hearst, who later starred at Georgia, and Sammie Smith,
who went to Florida State, won MVP honors in the annual border war
before moving on to rich collegiate and NFL careers.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, tailback Jamal Lewis of Douglass High exploded for
137 yards rushing in Georgia's 25-14 win. Shortly thereafter, Lewis
emerged as one of the nation's top freshmen at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Joe Burns of Thomas County Central, who will start
for the Georgia all-stars in Saturday's 6 p.m. contest in the
Georgia Dome, said he's well aware of the game's tradition of
running backs. And if Georgia stays with its ground game, which it
used last year to end Florida's six-year dominance in the series,
Burns is capable of etching his name in the record books as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at the (game) program and saw what all the other
running backs have done in this game,'' Burns said. ``I just want
to do well enough to get my name in the book and keep it in there
for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns, a 5-foot-9, 190-pounder, certainly left his mark in
Thomasville after a brilliant four-year prep career. Last year's
Journal-Constitution state player of the year, Burns rushed for a
school-record 5,006 career yards and 61 touchdowns, leading the
Yellow Jackets to consecutive Class AAA state titles as a junior
and senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very talented player,'' Georgia all-stars coach Rodney
Walker said. ``He brings great vision to the field. That's the
thing about him that amazes me, how he always seems to find the
holes.'' Burns doesn't have blinding speed, but his durability and
hard-nosed instincts helped earn the interest of several Division I
programs. He committed to Georgia Tech early, after, he said,
several schools backed off because of academic problems. Burns
later earned a qualifying ACT score, then shunned late scholarship
offers from Central Florida and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had made my mind up, but a lot of the colleges stayed away
because they didn't think I'd make it,'' Burns said. ``It made me
work even harder, because I knew what I was capable of doing in the
classroom. My dad was getting on me, because he knew I should have
been doing it all along.''

 &HT;    USGA to test clubs' `spring-like' effect
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It might be the first time golfers all over the
world maintained distance and accuracy through a press conference.
Those oversized titanium drivers that golf consumers have grown to
know and love appear to be safe from banishment. Nobody from the
United States Golf Association is going to yank them from their
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Although future standards are expected to be tougher, the USGA
announced Wednesday a relatively conservative plan, considering
recent fears by the equipment companies, who cringed at the thought
of major restrictions on products such as the Callaway Great Big
Bertha and Taylor Made Ti Bubble 2.
</P>
<P>
   The USGA said it is proposing a test to more accurately measure
the ``spring-like'' or ``trampoline'' effect of a golf ball against
a club face, but expects virtually all of the clubs currently
submitted to conform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe that the 'spring-like' effect in clubs that
are presently in use have lessened the skill required to play the
game at championships such as the U.S. Open or at the recreational
level,'' said David Fay, USGA executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said that a standard for ``spring-like'' effect will be
established in the next few months through improved testing and
submitted to manufacturers in advance of a meeting this fall.
Although the official rules of golf have contained a reference to
``spring-like'' effect since 1984, the USGA feels it needed to be
clarified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is what's around the corner,'' USGA president Buzz
Taylor said. ``It's quite clear that we're concerned with the
future of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   John Daly, who plays Callaway equipment and observed from the
back of the interview room, said, ``I don't believe in slowing down
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what America is all about.'' Early reaction from the
equipment companies was understandably favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the consumers are not only confused about the
conforming process, but are unsure about the future,'' said Wally
Uihlein, CEO of Titleist/Foot-Joy. ``I think the USGA took a big
step today.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of restrictions on other equipment also were exaggerated.
Fay said the USGA has been trying for two years to develop a new
test on golf balls.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been talk, but no decision, he said, on limiting
long putters or changing the club limit.

 &HT;    Martin's wheel life
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- There's been so much focus on how Casey Martin
gets to his ball, we overlook how he gets to the hitting area. The
practice range, where everyone is stationary, is the place to watch
the huge, smooth shoulder turn and the powerful downswing.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the slight instance where his right leg bends a
bit on the follow-through, there would be no way to discern the
circulatory disease that makes his career as a professional golfer
a day-to-day, minute-to-minute experience.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson doesn't want carts in pro golf, but like everyone
else, he wants Casey Martin, 26, to do well. One aspect is a matter
of compassion. The other is practicality. But, said Watson, ``I
think that he's got a wonderful golf swing. He's got a powerful
golf swing. It's a shame that he has that affliction.''
</P>
<P>
   The real shame is that because of the fight Martin chose to
undertake, his driving stats usually will be about cornering and
handling, not yardage and fairways hit. Martin hates that the cart
always dominates, but such is the double-edged sword. Without the
publicity and attention his disease (Klippel-Trenaunay-Weber
Syndrome), and the cart generated, he wouldn't be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the nature of the way things are going,'' Martin said, ``I
will always probably be known as the person in the golf cart. But I
can handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, having qualified for a U.S. Open that takes place on
familiar turf from his Stanford days, Martin made headlines when
the USGA-supplied, one-seater cart broke down Monday, forcing
implementation of a traditional golf cart. A day later, he won 30
bucks in a friendly match with Tiger Woods and Joel Kribel, his old
college teammates. For news value, the latter item probably has
more significance.
</P>
<P>
   Even Martin's presence here resulted from a struggle in his
sectional qualifier. He double-bogeyed his final hole in
regulation, then birdied the second hole of a playoff to secure a
spot at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is amazing how things happen,'' Martin said to an interview
room audience larger than Woods drew. ``I never would have dreamt
it. After going through the ordeal with the PGA Tour (lawsuit), I
didn't have any expectations to play in something like this and
really wasn't going to pursue it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest it be forgotten, Martin is a Nike Tour player. This is his
first event with the regular PGA Tour players, but not his first
opportunity. He refused several sponsor exemptions after the court
case, not wishing to fuel the controversy, but will play in the
Canon Greater Hartford Open in two weeks, largely because Hartford
Insurance is one of his sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't feel I was ready (for a PGA Tour event) and I
didn't want to deal with the media crush right then,'' Martin said
of those hectic days following the trial in Eugene, Ore. ``I wanted
some experience and I wanted to get playing on the Nike Tour
first.''
</P>
<P>
   No need to second-guess the plan. Martin won his first event,
the Nike Lakeland Classic. Two more wins or a finish among the Nike
Tour's top 15 money-winners earns exempt status on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody seems to know Casey Martin already. From the gallery,
kids yell his name. In the Olympic locker room, players greet him
warmly. Even those who were against the cart ruling. Martin is
slowly learning that those who didn't want him riding a cart merely
were concerned about future players who might exploit the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've met a lot of the guys, and without exception, everyone
has been just extremely kind to me and about extending me
support,'' he said. ``It's been a great experience. It's hard to
believe it's me sitting there and talking to the great players of
the world, and that they know my name (almost) before I know
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods doesn't deny it. He's lost all objectivity in the
matter. He is anti-golf carts but as pro-Casey as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really like seeing golf carts out here,'' Woods said,
``but he's one of my good friends, and I want to see him out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Watson, another former Stanford man, ``It is a tough
situation the (PGA) tour has taken, but I think the tour is right
in the sense that the game should be played walking. It is still an
athletic endeavor. People in better condition have an advantage to
people who are not in good condition. ... But the compassion must
go to Casey. It goes from me to Casey.'' Martin will be allowed to
take his cart on the fairway precisely to the ball while a caddie
carries his bag. A USGA official usually moves the cart forward as
much as possible for Martin to find when done putting. Cart or no
cart, Martin still has to walk a lot and his limp is painful for
others to watch. The ticket to ride has reduced the pain, Martin
said. So have responses like Tuesday, when thousands of fans at the
18th green roared for his final approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's stuff I dreamt about 10 years ago,'' he said. ``It's a
dream come true.''

TEENS `CAN'T HARDLY WAIT' TO PARTY LIKE IT'S 1981 (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cannily scheduled to open when most of its audience is out of
school and most of its stars' TV series are in reruns, ``Can't
Hardly Wait'' is like a bracing game of mud volleyball. It's kinda
stupid, extremely messy, even painful at times; but it's fun, even
if you do feel the need to shower afterward.
</P>
<P>
   It took two writer/directors to make this entertaining piece of
junk about a high school graduation-night party, and the movie is
so erratic that it often feels as if filmmakers Harry Elfont and
Deborah Kaplan were fighting over the camera. The strategy seems to
be: Take every '80s teen-party film you can remember, put 'em in a
blender, load the results into a shotgun and fire it at the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a soundtrack that appears to be a cross between
hitting the ``scan'' button and going on a blindfolded CD-store
shopping spree, and you have a movie that will set a lot of
people's teeth on edge. But if you can bear with the obnoxious
first half, it might break down your resistance; and it will
probably do it about the time a drunken partygoer does a
spontaneous karaoke riff on Guns N' Roses' ``Paradise City,'' one
of the funniest scenes in any movie this year.
</P>
<P>
   Movies like this give a reviewer pause. On a technical level,
it's not very good: The direction is chaotic, the writing uneven,
the characters familiar. We've all seen variations on the
free-spirited guy with a huge crush on the popular girl who just
got dumped by her jock boyfriend, the nerd who plots revenge and
gets it in a way he never expected, the white kid who wants to be
black and the unconventionally attractive (for movies, anyway),
cynical, independent girl.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cast even resembles '80s-bred actors: Peter
Facinelli, as the jock, looks like a young Tom Cruise; Lauren
Ambrose, as the cynical girl, has a faint Molly Ringwald-ish air
about her. One kid looks like a young Tony Danza. Others bring a
TV-based familiarity, including ``Party of Five's'' Jennifer Love
Hewitt as the dumped popular girl, ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer's''
Seth Green as the want-to-be-black kid, and a couple of other young
actors in unbilled cameos that we won't spoil, even if the previews
did.
</P>
<P>
   So it ain't exactly ``The Breakfast Club'' or ``Say Anything
...'' (although it has elements of each, as well as ``Fast Times at
Ridgemont High'' and even ``Animal House).'' But the '90s have been
too bereft of any sort of teen comedies to justify loud complaining
about ``Can't Hardly Wait,'' which falls firmly into the
guilty-pleasure category. Like the kids at the party, you'll
probably have a good time _ and hate yourself in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't Hardly Wait'' is rated PG-13 for strong language, sexual
situations and alcohol abuse, along with enough loud music to
deafen an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Movie: ``Can't Hardly Wait''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2 1/2 on a scale of 1-5

RED SOX CONTINUE MOMENTUM AGAINST WHITE SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The momentum is building, and the Red Sox are really
starting to enjoy themselves. They continue to roll against the
Elite and the Dead Meat. Lately, it doesn't make a difference which
they face.
</P>
<P>
   They had their way Wednesday with the Chicago White Sox in a
12-5 victory that was a lot closer than it might sound.
</P>
<P>
   In danger of squandering a 6-3 lead, the Red Sox flexed their
muscles to the tune of a six-run ninth inning _ all the damage
coming with two outs _ and wound up giving manager Jimy Williams
his 400th career victory and taking two of three at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   That gives Boston six wins in its last seven games, and they've
come against the best (National League power Atlanta) and just
about the worst (American League also-rans Tampa Bay and Chicago).
</P>
<P>
   Tim Wakefield's effort Wednesday typified the grit and
resourcefulness that have this team humming. On a bad day, he gave
the Red Sox six innings and left with a lead _ though, at 6-5, it
was shaky.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox supported him by erasing a 3-1 deficit on Mo
Vaughn's 20th home run, a two-run shot in the third, and scored
three times in the fifth with an ack-ack attack _ five singles and
a sacrifice fly _ to take the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly impressive was the way they broke things open in
the ninth and made Tom Gordon's major league-leading 20th save a
cakewalk. Boston sent nine batters to the plate against three
Chicago pitchers, collecting a walk and four hits _ including a
two-run double by Troy O'Leary and a three-run homer by Damon
Buford.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really a throwback kind of team,'' explained Darren
Lewis, a throwback kind of leadoff man who went 3 for 5 and scored
three runs. ``Every day we show up and try to win that game. That's
a sign of maturity and one of the reasons we have so much success.
I'm really enjoying my role. I'm a better hitter than I used to be.
I try to get on base any way I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis had help throughout the order as Boston piled up 13 hits.
Nomar Garciaparra and Vaughn each went 3 for 4 and scored three
runs, Vaughn driving in three and Garciaparra two. O'Leary was 2
for 5 with three RBIs, and Buford knocked in three runs.
</P>
<P>
   It all added up to a most pleasant milestone for Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who won his 400th?'' the manager said with a grin. ``Me? I
didn't know. I'm just trying to win a game. We got some key hits.
Everybody pitched good. The big thing today is we got some big
two-out hits. Mo's homer was with two out. Nomar got a two-out walk
just before it. If you look at the score, you'd think it was a
blowout. But it wasn't. It was a tough game. They were pushing us.
That's the way they play.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield could readily attest to that. Things got tight when
Chicago rallied for two runs in the sixth _ on Magglio Ordonez's
RBI double and the pitcher's wild pickoff throw to second that
allowed Robin Ventura to scurry home from third _ and had the tying
run on third with two out. But Wakefield struck out Greg Norton and
wound up joining Pedro Martinez and Bret Saberhagen to give Boston
three eight-game winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deserve a win on this,'' he said. ``The offense does.
The whole key for the starter is to keep the team in the ballgame.
I did that until my last inning with two outs when things sort of
got away from me. I let two runs in and was fortunate to get a big
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wakefield also got a pick-me-up from Rich Garces, who is
excelling as the setup man and showed why with 1 1/3 shutout
innings. Gordon went the final 1 2/3, stranding the tying run in
the eighth, and picked up his first save in 18 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our success has to do with the kind of team we got
here,'' said Wakefield. ``The bullpen has been good. Bret, Pedro,
and myself have been on the good side of what's happening, and
that's why we have eight wins apiece. It's nice. Real nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, the de facto team spokesman, provided the last word.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a very solid approach, plays very hard, and
plays together,'' he said. ``We know they're not going to hold us
down forever. We all know our roles. Sometimes it works and
sometimes it doesn't. We take it day by day. I don't know how many
games we've played. I don't know what our record is. It's best that
way. Just go out there and play.''

 &HT;    Jones 1st as All-Star at third
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The polls are still open, but in the National League
third base is closed. Chipper Jones is assured a starting place in
the 1998, that is unless Colorado's Vinny Castilla knows where to
find 186,000 votes between now and Monday, when balloting is
completed.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark the third time Jones has made the All-Star team
but the first as an elected representative. To him, the distinction
between the two is immense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're selected by a manager other than your own, it could
mean something,'' said Jones, who had over 793,000 votes by this
week's count. ``Not that going the last two years with Bobby (Cox)
having to pick me wasn't a great honor. But you got to think
Bobby's a little biased in certain areas. While my numbers were
certainly good enough to warrant an All-Star selection the last
couple years, Bobby picked a lot of guys to go with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones entered Wednesday's game listed in the top 10 in five NL
offensive catagories, including fourth in hits (87) and eighth in
RBIs (55). Batting .325, with 17 homers, he is on pace for a 39-127
year, which would be the strongest production from an Atlanta third
baseman since Eddie Mathews' 47-135 season in 1953. He is expected
to team with shortstop Walt Weiss to put the Braves along the left
side of the infield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot,'' Jones said. ``The population has the power
to pick the starting lineup and the majority of the population
feels I'm the best third baseman in the National League. That's a
great honor. I'm flattered.''
</P>
<P>
   The long and the short
</P>
<P>
   With left-hander Jesus Sanchez starting for the Marlins
Wednesday, Michael Tucker was out of the lineup for the second time
in three games. Coming off one of the best months of his career,
Tucker has found June a cruel place. After hitting .323 with seven
home runs and 21 RBIs in May, he is batting .229 (11-for-48) this
month, with no homers and one RBI over the first 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Over in left field, Ryan Klesko's luck is running an exact
opposite. After hitting .208 in April, Klesko's production has
steadily picked up to where he is swinging the Braves' best bat
this month (.378 with four homers and seven RBIs).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be nice to have everything going at the same time,'' said
Tucker. ``One of those things. Hopefully you get everyone on the
same page come October. Wow, we could be doing a lot of
celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Neagle stopped by the Marlins dugout during batting
practice to talk with Florida manager Jim Leyland about Neagle's
Tuesday strong comments about the quality of the Marlins' current
lineup. Leyland, who managed Neagle for most of five seasons in
Pittsburgh, said no clarification was necessary. ``That's not Denny
Neagle, Denny Neagle wouldn't laugh at anybody,'' Leyland said.
``He's a class act and a helluva pitcher. He doesn't have to
apologize to me.'' ... Probable pitching assignments for next
week's New York Yankees series _ Monday: Greg Maddux vs. Andy
Pettitte; Tuesday: Tom Glavine vs. Orlando Hernandez; Wednesday:
Kevin Millwood vs. David Cone; Thursday: John Smoltz vs. David
Wells. ... As promised, Neagle was modeling a Detroit Red Wings
jersey and cap Tuesday, payoff from his Stanley Cup bet with Wings
megafan Smoltz.

 &HT;    Mexico denounces near-border waste site
 &HT;    By Brad Prendergast
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Tx. _ Haze from raging forest fires in Mexico may be
graying Texas skies, but Mexican delegates in Austin Wednesday said
nuclear waste that the state plans to bury near the border poses a
much greater health threat.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican state and federal lawmakers were at the Capitol to
persuade Texas officials to move a proposed radioactive waste
facility from an underground site near Sierra Blanca, a small town
16 miles from the Rio Grande and 90 miles southeast of El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   The officials expressed concern that potential radioactive leaks
could cause problems in Mexico but deflected criticisms that their
request was hypocritical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfortunate that we've had the fires, but I don't
think it (the haze) has much relevance,'' said Mexican senator
Norberto Corella, a member of the delegation from Baja California.
</P>
<P>
   Corella cited a 1983 accord between the United States and
Mexico, known as the La Paz treaty, in which the countries agreed
that no new sources of environmental pollution would be knowingly
introduced within 60 miles of either side of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not honoring the agreement,'' he said, at one point
holding up a sample of the 32,000 signatures on a petition from
Mexicans denouncing the site location. ``It's just not right.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates also met with Texas' secretary of state, Al
Gonzales, who promised to pass their concerns to Gov. George W.
Bush, according to the secretary's spokeswoman, Jane Dees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's office will continue to study the feasibility
of the site,'' Dees said.
</P>
<P>
   The material that would be stored at the site would come from
nuclear plants, hospitals and research institutes in Texas, Vermont
and Maine if Congress approves a pending compact between the
states. Under the compact, the two New England states would pay
Texas $25 millionapiece to have their low-level radioactive waste
buried at the Sierra Blanca waste site.
</P>
<P>
   The compact has been passed by both houses of Congress, and
arrangements were made Monday night to begin ironing out the
differences between the bills from each house.
</P>
<P>
   Debbi Head, a spokeswoman for Bush, said the governor ``will
support the site only if two things occur: if the compact passes
and if the site is deemed safe.'' Licensing hearings for the site
are ongoing.

 &HT;    On Deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 1:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: Fox Sports South, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (9-2, 2.68; 5-6,
3.56 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. RHP Ryan Dempster (0-2, 10.20; first
appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Glavine is collecting some payback from 1997, when he had
12 non-decisions. Not only does he have just two NDs during his
first 14 starts, but the team has responded on the few nights when
he has been vulnerable. In the three games Glavine has given up
four runs or more, he is 1-1; other Braves starters are 3-10 when
yielding four or more. Although he is unbeaten in his last seven
starts, he is coming off a 9-7 victory over Montreal, when he
allowed a season-high 11 hits. Glavine has worked into the seventh
inning in 10 games, in part because of some excellent run support
(6.1 runs per game). Dempster, making his fourth major-league
start, is coming off an excellent showing against New York last
Friday, when he limited the Mets to one earned run in seven
innings. A Canadian from Gibsons, British Columbia, Dempster
originally was property of the Texas Rangers, who picked him in the
third round of the 1995 draft. Texas traded him to the Marlins a
year later as part of the John Burkett deal. Just 10-9 last season
while pitching at Class A Brevard County, Dempster has been hurt in
the majors by left-handers, who are hitting .444 against him with
11 walks and four homers in just 27 at-bats.

 &HT;    Patience the key at Olympic
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Welcome to a different kind of U.S. Open, where
feats of strength will be required as the first round commences
today, but not as frequently as those dealing with finesse. Where,
for a change, oppressive heat and humidity need not be factored in.
Where, except for a few holes, distance is downplayed and daring is
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the 98th U.S. Open at The Olympic Club, where the
greens are the size of patios, but not as hard as the United States
Golf Association would like.
</P>
<P>
   Where the rough is deeper than what grows on the lawn of your
laziest neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Where the driver could be the least important club in the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Where the weather for three days has been so spectacular _ blue
skies, temperatures in the mid-70's, no humidity _ that locals are
bracing for either brush fires, quakes, floods or a sourdough
strike at Fisherman's Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   Where par is not only a good score; it might be a winning score.
</P>
<P>
   Where the list of contenders is a mixed one, ranging from the
young and the restless to at least one approaching a tour where
everybody takes a cart.
</P>
<P>
   The shotmaker's choice is Justin Leonard. The
middle-of-the-fairway favorites are Colin Montgomerie and Jim
Furyk. Somewhere in the middle are Fred Couples, Ernie Els and
Davis Love _ provided their backs all remain out of spasm.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the picture are David Duval, Stewart Cink and Tiger
Woods. Surely not to be ignored are experienced players such as Tom
Watson, Mark O'Meara and Tom Lehman, whose competitive fires
haven't dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   ```Possible winner' from `not a chance' is a big upgrade for
me,'' said Colonial winner Watson, 48, who lost by a stroke here to
Scott Simpson in 1987. ``I like being a favorite. I'm very
comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, 26, who won a British Open last summer and finished
behind Love at the PGA, seems to fit Olympic as well as anyone in
the field. He is among the best in shaping the ball and his
temperament is ideal for a tournament where patience is so crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've enjoyed playing the golf course and I feel real good
about my game right now,'' Leonard said Wednesday after a final
practice round. ``Hopefully, I can hit the ball well enough to give
myself a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   For Woods to contend, he must show more patience with the rough
than he's indicated in U.S. Opens past. He tied for 19th at
Congressional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't playing as I would have liked going into
Congressional,'' Woods said. ``This year is different. I feel great
about my swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who had great chances to win the last three U.S. Opens,
yielded in 1997 to Els by finding the water at the 71st hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get in that situation again this year,'' Lehman said,
``I'm going to be looking more toward the middle of the greens.''

 &HT;    Storied Open, site meet today's time
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- Welcome, from the leeward side of the cliff
that partitions The Olympic Club from the churning Pacific. First
time I ever saw it was aboard a Honduran freighter headed to Pearl
Harbor, never sure I'd ever make it back. I did, several times, but
not in 1956, year of the incredible defeat of Ben Hogan by a foot
soldier out of the pro shop of a public course in Davenport, Iowa.
The subject of this old club, dramatically clinging to a string of
forested precipes, and the U.S. Open never comes up without
connecting it with the year Jack Fleck beat ``The Hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   In those times, the Open was played in three days, with 36 holes
on Saturday. That Fleck should have tied Hogan in the first place
was shock enough, that he should have beat him in a Sunday playoff
was even more improbable.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to have slipped the minds of golf that after the
playoff, Hogan suddenly announced he was retiring. It deflected a
lot of the attention from Fleck in his grandest hour, of course,
and some looked at it as the deliberate purpose. Of course Hogan
didn't retire. He was still playing in the Open 11 years later, but
as time passed, assumed the cloak of an idol, surely too much above
the level of such pettiness. But it happened and has been quietly
dissolved by time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Casper humiliated Arnold Palmer here in 1966. Scott Simpson
won the Open here in 1987, unpopular among the slanted media,
sitting poised and eager to write of Tom Watson winning. Watson's
25-foot putt failed to fall on the 18th green, after which Simpson
spoke genuinely of his relationship with God.
</P>
<P>
   Now we are back, and all things have changed. We can't keep our
eyes on golf for the carnival going on around us. Tiger Woods comes
to challenge The Olympic. Try that one on for size. Ernie Els won
the last Open at Congressional, but all the covers out here carry
the likeness of Woods. It is a sort of homecoming. He went to
Stanford, ``The Farm,'' they call it here, but the real uproar
centers around another Cardinal, the young Casey Martin, and the
cart he rode in on.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is the Nike Tour player from Eugene, Ore., with the bad
leg. He won the verdict in his hometown court that allows him to be
the only professional on a regular tour allowed to play from a
cart. ``God provides,'' as he has said.
</P>
<P>
   He was asked the other day if he thought that some day he might
be known for his golf game rather than his wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probaby always be known as the person in the golf cart,''
he said. ``I can handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several of his peers who aren't handling too well,
including his fellow alumnus, Watson. ``I think the Tour is right
in the sense that the game should be played walking,'' he said.
Said Jack Nicklaus, ``I don't like it as it relates to the rules of
golf. I'm just questioning the ultimate, what can happen to the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   He would be merely another player in the field, but for the
cart. He made it dramatically and must feel like the two-headed at
the county fair. This is a championship that each year brings out
the backwoods player, some kid or veteran from up the track getting
his one chance at the brass ring. Lee Trevino got his start in the
U.S. Open. There are names here you may be seeing for the first and
last time _ Robert Deruntz, Garrett Larson, Rene Rengel, Derek
Gilchrist, Grant Clough, Gary March, Vaughn Taylor, an amateur from
Augusta, and Ken Peyreferry. All playing for the U.S. championship,
all even with Woods, Watson, Els, Nicklaus, and yes, Casey Martin,
as the first blow is struck.
</P>
<P>
   If fate should tip a hand to anybody, it ought to be Tom Lehman.
This man has finished second or third in each of the last three
Opens. How many times can he be denied?

US TRIES TO BOLSTER THE YEN, EASE FEAR OF WIDENING CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States made an unusual foray into the
currency markets Wednesday, selling dollar reserves in an attempt
to prop up the Japanese yen and calm fears that Japan's sinking
economy would prompt a worldwide financial downturn.
</P>
<P>
   The move, the first US effort to raise the yen in six years,
came after the Japanese government promised new measures to revive
its economy, which has slid into recession. Early results suggest
that the US intervention was providing Japan at least some
short-term relief. The yen rose from the eight-year low against the
dollar set earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   US investors cheered the move by bidding the Dow Jones
industrial average up 164 points to close at 8829.46. The Dow had
fallen 207 points on Monday on fears of an expanding Asian
financial crisis, and it had risen only modestly on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And in Japan, the 225-share Nikkei average, the nation's main
stock market barometer, jumped 3.20 percent, or 470.83 points, to
15,186.21 Thursday morning in the first 20 minutes of trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very smart move by the United States,'' said C.
Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International
Economics, a research group. ``We were getting to the point where
global financial crisis was really possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The falling yen has cut the price of Japanese steel, computer
chips and electronics on the world market, alarming nations that
sell the same products. Companies that export to Japan are also
finding it difficult to sell their own goods because the purchasing
power of the yen is weak.
</P>
<P>
   From South Korean to Russia and Brazil, countries are under
pressure to devalue their own currencies so that they can compete
with Japan. But cheaper currencies would make it harder for them to
pay off the dollar-denominated foreign debts they have accumulated
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Calls for Japan and the United States to prop up the yen have
been particularly strong in China, where President Clinton is to
visit next week. China has so far resisted devaluing its own
currency in response to the sagging yen.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton said he supported the US
plan to sell yen after Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
promised in a Tuesday evening phone call to make ``aggressive''
economic reforms, including steps to deal with the country's
weakened banks, which are saddled with bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very encouraged by the prime minister's statement that
he intends to pursue aggressive reform of their banking
institutions and intends to do the things that were necessary to
get their economy going again,'' Clinton said, ``and therefore I
thought it was important that we support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Treasury and the Federal Reserve hold authority to
trade US reserves, and they made the decision jointly, US officials
said. The Treasury said it acted ``in cooperation with the monetary
authorities of Japan,'' which private currency traders said meant
that the Bank of Japan had also bought yen.
</P>
<P>
   US officials would not discuss the value of dollars that had
been sold by the United States and the Bank of Japan to buy yen,
and estimates from private currency traders ranged from $2 billion
to more than $6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hearing that it could be $15 billion, but no one really
knows, because central banks don't discuss these things,'' said
David Warren, a London-based portfolio manager for T. Rowe Price
international funds.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has drawn wide criticism for failing to take steps to end
its eight-year economic stall. The criticism has turned to alarm as
the yen lost about 10 percent of its value against the dollar this
year, suggesting that Japan would be unable to lead Asia out of its
financial crisis by buying products from troubled neighbors like
Indonesia, South Korea and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government has promised to close or merge banks
that have been weakened by bad loans, but few large banks have
actually shut their doors. Hashimoto also has proposed a $115
billion tax cut to spur consumer spending, but some critics say the
amount is not nearly enough and note that the plan remains stuck in
the Japanese parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, some analysts said they had little faith that Japan
was finally ready to act.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hashimoto didn't say the wrong thing, but he's saying the same
things that have been said before, with no greater specificity,''
said Gary Hufbauer, research director of at the Council on Foreign
Relations in New York. ``There's a lot of market skepticisim that
he will carry through real reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts warned that the US currency intervention by
itself would have little long-term effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen a currency intervention work unless the
fundamentals were also in line...and Japan is not taking action to
get them in line,'' said Ronald Reuss, chief economist at Piper
Jaffray Cos., a Minneapolis stock brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Hufbauer said the US currency intervention, and the prospect
that it would buy yen again if necessary, would take pressure off
the Japanese currency for a month or so. ``But if Japan does not
deliver on the tax cuts, skepticism will grow back in, say, late
July or August,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hufbauer echoed many other analysts who believe that Japan's
banking crisis is at the core of its economic downturn. ``They need
to restructure like we did in the 1980s'' with the savings and loan
crisis, said Hufbauer, who speculated that Japanese banks are
carrying $500 billion in bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts have put the bad loans at half that amount, or
equal to 10 percent of Japan's gross domestic product. The US
government spent $153 billion in direct costs to clean up savings
and loan losses, or about 3 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
   The air of alarm over Japan comes as the US economy is booming.
Only last week, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan told
Congress that the economy was the best he had seen in his 50-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   That stellar performance has come in part because the Asian
crisis is allowing Americans to buy foreign goods at low prices,
keeping US inflation low. However, Greenspan and others have warned
that Asia's woes could become more problematic. US companies could
find it harder to compete with low-priced Asian goods, and the
once-growing Asian economies now have little money to buy US
products.
</P>
<P>
   The US decision to begin selling dollars for yen marked an
abrupt change in government policy. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin
had been downplaying the prospects that the US would help the
Japanese economy by propping up the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the Japanese government reported that the
country's economy had shrunk for the second quarter in a row,
meeting the traditional measure of a recession. Stock markets
around the world reacted this week with sharp downturns,
heightening fears that the Japan's problem would ripple beyond
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's trading of US reserves was handled by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, which is the Treasury's agent in the
currency market. One dollar bought 136.75 yen late Wednesday, down
4.4 percent from Tuesday's close of 143.18 yen, and also down from
Monday's mark of nearly 147 yen.
</P>
<P>
   In another apparent boost to the yen, Treasury announced that
Lawrence Summers, its No. 2 official, and New York Fed Bank
President William McDonough will go to Tokyo for a weekend meeting
of finance officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations.
Traders speculated that Summers would press the case that Japan
must follow through on plans to improve the economy.

TOBACCO BILL DIES IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate abruptly killed comprehensive
antitobacco legislation last night, halting a historic attempt to
crack down on the cigarette industry and creating a powerful issue
in this year's congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   The $516 billion plan, built from a blueprint drawn nearly one
year ago in a landmark settlement between the tobacco industry and
40 state attorneys general, died of procedural causes after
supporters were unable to defeat two parliamentary moves by Senate
Republican leaders to scuttle it.
</P>
<P>
   A motion to force a final vote on the measure fell three votes
short of the 60 that supporters needed, 57-42, even though 15
Republicans broke with GOP leaders who called for killing the bill.
All the Democrats except two from tobacco-growing states voted for
the motion.
</P>
<P>
   The measure expired moments later when supporters failed to
secure the 60 votes needed to waive a Senate rule that would have
permitted the plan to exceed last year's balanced budget agreement.
The vote was 53-46, seven votes shy.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who had called on Congress to use last year's
tobacco settlement as the framework for curbing youth smoking,
immediately cast the setback as an election issue. He blamed the
bill's demise on Republican congressional leaders and ``$40 million
in unanswered advertising by their allies'' in the tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was seen by members of both parties as one of the
most iportant issues Congress would take up this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that when the American people understand fully what
has been going on, they won't like what they see,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the 57 votes to keep the bill alive, Clinton said the
number ``clearly shows that a bipartisan majority supports tough
legislation to protect the children of this country from tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's death was expected to provide fresh momentum for
lawsuits pending against the tobacco industry in 36 states.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain of Arizona, a Republican and the bill's
sponsor, joined Clinton in blaming the tobacco industry's
advertising blitz for turning public opinion against the bill. He
said the campaign caused a number of senators who once supported
the plan to abandon it.
</P>
<P>
   Six Republicans who voted for the measure when it passed the
Senate Commerce Committee 19-1 in April, voted last night to kill
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there has been a change of view by many members,''
McCain said. ``The only conclusion one can draw is that the tobacco
advertising campaign had a significant impact on their
conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, which cast the antitobacco measure as one of
the most regressive tax-and-spend boondoggles in decades, was seen
as providing crucial support to a small group of Republican foes
who succeeded in killing the bill after four weeks of rancorous
debate.
</P>
<P>
   The ads ``were like cruise missiles equipped with nuclear
bombs,'' said Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., a Delaware Democrat.
``They work every time in this town.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Democrats vowed to use every parliamentary tool they can
to keep the issue on the legislative agenda, even though House
Speaker Newt Gingrich has said he will not allow the
Republican-controlled House to use the Senate bill as the basis for
a legislative compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans may mug this bill in the Senate, but they
cannot kill it,'' Senator Edward M. Kennedy said moments before the
parliamentary votes. ``We will not let it die.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is backing much narrower legislation aimed at curbing
youth smoking and drug abuse, a measure that public health
officials have called severely inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to reduce teen smoking, not increase taxes,''
Gingrich said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry, the Democratic point man on the
antitobacco bill, assailed Senate GOP leaders for failing to defy
Gingrich's desire for a less ambitious measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newt Gingrich put out a contract on this bill,'' Kerry said,
``and the Republicans in the Senate are the hit people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kennedy's vow to revive the issue, GOP leaders,
including McCain, said the Democratic minority will not be able to
overcome Republican opposition to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader,
denounced the bill as an unsalvageable ``tax and spend'' plan.
``We've lost sight of the original noble cause of just dealing with
teen-aged smoking and drug abuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was among the 15 Republicans who broke with Lott and
voted not to kill the bill. Every New England senator voted to keep
the measure alive except for Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The only New England senators who opposed the other
parliamentary, balanced-budget maneuver were Smith and Senator Judd
Gregg, also a New Hampshire Republican. That vote effectively
returned the bill to the Senate Commerce Committee, which the
chairman, McCain, said was tantamount to killing it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have required the tobacco industry to pay
billions of dollars over 25 years to help states and the federal
government bear the medical costs of smoking-related illnesses. The
measure also would have raised cigarette taxes by $1.10-a-pack over
five years, expanded the Food and Drug Administration's power to
regulate the tobacco industry and drastically restricted cigarette
advertising and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the cigarette tax hikes, which the bill
required tobacco companies to pass on to consumers, were an unfair,
economic assault on the 60 percent of smokers who earn less than
$30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a defining moment for the Republican Party as to
whether or not we are going to have a massive tax increase and
expansion of big government,'' said Senator John Ashcroft, a
Missouri Republican and leading opponent of the bill. ``We should
not become the party of massive taxes on low-income workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican foes succeeded in amending the bill to provide $27
billion in relief for low-income couples who pay a marriage tax
penalty. Several other Republican amendments passed as well,
including a provision that would have used $17 billion on the
tobacco money for antidrug initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Repulicans who pushed for those changes voted
not to allow a final vote on the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the senators who derailed this bill lose sleep every
night listening to the sound of children taking their first puff
and the sound of emphysema and cancer patients gasping for their
last breath,'' said Dr. C. Everett Koop, a former surgeon general.

   &UR; By JAYNE CUSTRED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Tom Watson has faced the rigors of a U.S. Open at
the Olympic Club before and survived. In fact, when the national
championship was played here in 1987, Watson finished second.
</P>
<P>
   But even Watson believes it's a much tougher tract facing the
156 golfers who will tee it up today for the first round of the
1998 Open Championship. And by Sunday, it will be the man who uses
patience, not power, who will be the last one standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This rough is the worst rough, most difficult rough, that I
have seen in the U.S. Open ever,'' Watson said. ``This is clingy
rough. You just don't know what it is going to do when you are
trying to hit a shot out of it around the green. So it is going to
put a premium on everything, as it always does in the U.S. Open,
but especially this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the winning score here, I think for four rounds it will
be over par.''
</P>
<P>
   After two full days of practice at the Olympic Club, where one
errant drive means bogey at best, other golfers in the field were
starting to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am waiting for them to go out there and cut the rough a
little bit, but my understanding is that they are not going to,''
David Duval said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Jack Nicklaus: ``The golf course is certainly a formidable
test. And it is certainly a golf course that most of the young kids
today will not have experienced, that type of golf course. That
doesn't mean they can't play it. They just won't have experienced
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But they certainly will this week, in all its glory.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it will have to get to the humiliating point before the
USGA intends to do anything to make the Olympic Club any tamer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can't find your golf ball and we start to slow down
play and it really begins to make fun of the best players in the
universe, that is when I don't think it is quite proper,'' said Tim
Morahan, the USGA representative who set up the course. ``I want it
to be a challenge out there, but I don't want it to embarrass
someone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as you all know, the U.S. Open has two things that we
strive for _ tough rough and fast, firm greens.''
</P>
<P>
   The players will get a slight break on the latter. The San
Francisco area has been pounded by rain the last few weeks, and
while it has not rained for several days now, the greens remain
softer and slower than Morahan would like. But otherwise, Olympic
is ready to take on whatever the golfers want to throw at her.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, the Masters champion who is also the king when it
comes to winning on the West Coast, said the game plan should be a
simple one: patience, perseverance and being able to swallow your
pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the U.S. Open is ever about who makes the most
birdies,'' O'Meara said. ``It is definitely not a birdie feast out
there. It is more about managing your good shots and your bad
shots. So you eliminate the big score and try to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   That has proved true nearly every year. In 1997 at Congressional
Country Club, Tiger Woods made the most birdies during the Open,
yet Woods finished tied for 19th.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the players being tabbed over and over as the
favorites to win this weekend aren't necessarily the most
flamboyant, fire-at-the-flag golfers but the ones who seem to find
success by plodding along patiently, taking their pars and an
occasional birdie and never getting ahead of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Players like Colin Montgomerie, Tom Lehman and Justin Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if you were going to pick a couple of tournaments
for me with my game to play well in, this would be one of them,''
Leonard said. ``Because when I am playing well, I hit a lot of
fairways. I make a few putts and avoid making mistakes. I am a very
patient player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think those are the kind of attributes that pay off in this
kind of event where par is a really good score, as I think it will
be this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being one of the youngest golfers in the field, Woods
also has more experience than most at Olympic. He played countless
practice rounds here when he was a member of the golf team at
nearby Stanford University. And he likes nothing more than to hear
that his game is not set up for this course, or this major
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like when people say that,'' Woods said. ``It definitely
gets me a little revved up. But you also have to understand you
still go out there and play the game no matter what the
motivational factor is. That is all aside once you step on the
first tee and you have got to go out there and get your focus on
and maintain your confidence all the way through and your patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preparation has been very intense. Physically, mentally, as
far as hitting balls, lifting and then also the mental part of the
game, it has been pretty intense. I am pretty proud of the way I am
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that will be enough for Woods to win at Olympic Club
will begin to unfold today, where the first round of what is
certain to be a very long tournament begins for the best golfers in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to see the names fluctuate on that leader
board,'' O'Meara said. ``It happens every year. We might see some
prizes. But I would think that coming down the stretch on Sunday,
you are going to see a guy who has either been there before or who
has been playing well as of late. It will be the player who can
understand what he can do and what he can't do with a golf ball.''

TRAINING PARTNERS VIE FOR RECORD IN 100-YARD DASH
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Athens, Ato Boldon won a 100-meter dash Wednesday in 9.86
seconds, missing the world record by two-hundredths of a second.
Only two men have run faster in track and field's glamour race.
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, an ocean and two half-continents away, Maurice
Greene heard the result and smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's kind of stuck on that time,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Greene said it proudly and with a smile because Boldon is his
training partner and good friend. One or the other seems about to
break the world record. Or perhaps both.
</P>
<P>
   Greene is a 23-year-old American. Boldon is 24 and runs for his
native Trinidad. They train in Los Angeles under John Smith, a
former Olympian and world record-holder who has become track and
field's sprint guru.
</P>
<P>
   Greene will run the 100 meters and maybe the 200 in the U.S.
outdoor championships, which start Friday and end Sunday in New
Orleans. Because the meet is limited to American citizens, Boldon
went to Athens for the Tsiklitiria international, a lesser
competition, and beat Frank Fredericks of Namibia (timed in 9.93
seconds) by two feet. Later, Boldon won the 200 meters in 19.88
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The only accepted 100-meter times faster than Boldon's Wednesday
were 9.84 seconds by Donovan Bailey of Canada in the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics and 9.85 by Leroy Burrell in 1994. Previous 9.86's had
been run by Carl Lewis, Fredericks, Greene and Boldon, with Boldon
doing it two months ago in Walnut, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   There have been faster 100's that do not count. Ben Johnson of
Canada ran 9.79 in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, only to lose the gold
medal and the world record when he tested positive for illegal

EDITORIAL: FLAWED APPROACHES TO PAROLE REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   The death of Jenna Grieshaber, allegedly at the hands of a
paroled felon, and the recent killing of a New York City police
officer, Anthony Mosomillo, by a man wanted for a parole violation
have fueled efforts to restrict parole in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, has election-year politics. The state Senate, with Gov.
George Pataki's backing, has passed a bill to end parole for
first-time violent offenders. Not to be outdone, the Assembly last
week also approved a bill to end parole.
</P>
<P>
   Neither bill deals with the broader problems in the state's
sentencing structure, of which parole is only a part. But the
Assembly's measure is somewhat less objectionable, because it makes
some effort to rehabilitate inmates as well as lengthen sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, first-time violent offenders are eligible for
parole after serving half of their sentences. In most cases,
offenders are released after serving two-thirds of their sentences.
Both Senate and Assembly proposals would require offenders to serve
at least 85 percent of their sentences. In most cases this would
mean much longer prison stays for many kinds of crimes, ranging
from murder to second-degree burglary.
</P>
<P>
   There is little evidence that simply increasing sentences
enhances public safety in a cost-effective way. As it is, the
inmate population has nearly tripled over the past 15 years, and
the operating budget for state prisons has more than tripled since
1982. The only fiscally responsible way to pay for longer sentences
for violent offenders is to reform other parts of the sentencing
system.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, that means changing the drug laws enacted under
Gov. Nelson Rockefeller that impose long mandatory sentences on
many low-level, nonviolent drug offenders. The tens of millions
spent keeping small-time drug offenders locked up for 15 years or
more could be better deployed on treatment programs to cut crime
associated with drug addiction. Yet Pataki refuses to consider
drug-law reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly bill would allow judges to divert some nonviolent
drug offenders into treatment with reduced prison time. That is one
step in the right direction. The bill would also provide more
in-prison addiction treatment and vocational training.
</P>
<P>
   To the governor, these are unnecessary frills. But nearly all
inmates will be released eventually. If prison fails to provide
some means for rehabilitation, ending parole will increase
incarceration costs without significantly improving public safety
in the long run.

NEW YORK CITY TEAMSTERS LEADER BACKS HOFFA FOR UNION PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The president of a large teamsters' local in New York
City, who two years ago was a running mate of the union's
president, Ron Carey, announced Wednesday that he was endorsing
James P. Hoffa in this summer's campaign for the union's
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement, by Carroll Haynes, president of Teamsters Local
237, which represents 23,000 government employees in New York City
and on Long Island, was a surprise because in 1996 he was elected
vice president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters when
he ran on Carey's slate.
</P>
<P>
   Carey defeated Hoffa in that race, but federal monitors
overturned that election and ordered a rerun when they found that
Carey campaign aides had improperly siphoned union money into the
Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Carey has been barred from running again.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement endorsing Hoffa, Haynes said: ``It's time for
healing, and time to come together to protect and insure the
survival of our great union. Teamsters need to focus their energies
on electing a leader who can unite our deeply fractured union.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who is widely considered the favorite, welcomed the
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   He is opposed by Thomas Leedham, director of the union's
warehouse division and a member of the union's Carey wing.

 Tech's Glamour Gal   By Carolyn Said  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
She stares confidently from the magazine page, her lips shaping a
wisp of a smile, her body sheathed in a low-cut black dress. She
could be advertising liquor or cigarettes, perfume or cosmetics.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Katrina Garnett is selling ``CrossWorlds United Application
Architecture,'' from CrossWorlds Software of Burlingame. And she's
not a model; she's the president, chief executive and founder of
the company _ a woman who works hard to burnish her reputation as a
technologist and a feminist.
</P>
<P>
   The glamour shot, now appearing in Vanity Fair, Forbes, Fortune,
George and other upscale magazines, illustrates how some high-tech
firms attempt to build their images around charismatic leaders
rather than complicated products.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Customers aren't just buying our software, they're buying a
relationship,'' Garnett said. ``They want to know who is behind
CrossWorlds. I put a face on the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Basing a corporate image on a CEO isn't new. Chrysler, Men's
Wearhouse and Wendy's have all done it.
</P>
<P>
   Like those traditional businesses, Silicon Valley startups
increasingly promote their technology hotshots in ads and articles.
Netscape's Marc Andreessen, Marimba's Kim Polese and Yahoo's Jerry
Yang and David Filo have achieved star status thanks to aggressive
marketing machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has always lionized captains of industry,'' said Santa
Cruz author Paulina Borsook, whose book ``Cyberselfish:
Technolibertarians and the True Revenge of the Nerds'' is due out
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The railroad and oil barons appealed to the imagination of the
19th century. Now, technology people are getting that sense about
themselves: `We're sexy; what we do matters and it has high
sheen,''' Borsook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a celebrity era, whether it's movie stars, athletes
or politicians,'' said Felix Gutierrez, executive director of the
Pacific Coast Center of the Freedom Forum, a foundation focused on
media issues. ``This seems like an assertive attempt to have
customers identify with the creative energy/vision person behind
the technology.''
</P>
<P>
   But some people think that the Crossworlds ad is too assertive
in its use of sex appeal and its close resemblance to an editorial
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Labeled simply ``Trail Blazer'' and photographed by the renowned
Richard Avedon, it blends into magazines like just another glossy
article.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's creating a stir,'' said Laurie Kretchmar, editor in chief
of Women.com, a San Mateo network of Web sites. ``It's a beautiful
ad, but it looks like an editorial photo feature. The twist is that
it's a very attractive female CEO. Her choice of attire was
interesting. Let's face it, sex sells.''
</P>
<P>
   Marleen McDaniel, president and chief executive of Women.com,
said she prefers ads that focus on substance over style. ``I think
this kind of approach misses the point, unless the company is
Victoria's Secret,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some are even more blunt. &UR;  &LR; ``In the valley, people don't care
what you look like, they care what you've accomplished,'' said an
employee at one Internet software company. ``This seems like an
egotistic thing, trading on sex appeal to get attention.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Garnett said the ad isn't about sex, it's about defining a
brand image for CrossWorlds. ``Just because I'm in high tech, I
don't have to look like a nerd,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ad's copy reads like a Dewar's profile. It states her age as
``Younger than Bill Gates, older than Michael Dell.'' (She's 35.)
It lists Garnett's birthplace, ``Australia's Gold Coast''; favorite
charity, ``Started Garnett Foundation to encourage girls to pursue
technical careers''; and background, ``10 years on the firing line
at Oracle and Sybase.''
</P>
<P>
   It also describes CrossWorlds' investors, ``Raised $45 (million)
from Intel, Compaq, SAP, Manugistics, JD Edwards, Ernst &AMP; Young,''
and ``Bigtime backers: Dave Duffield, Michael Dell, Andy Ludwick.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall message is that Garnett and the company ``take
risks, aim high, believe in what we're doing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   CrossWorlds' software knits together disparate enterprise
applications, such as an inventory system and payroll software. At
$250,000 and up, it's strictly for huge corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett and her husband _ venture capitalist Terence Garnett,
who is on CrossWorlds' board _ have put $5.5 million of their own
money into the company. CrossWorlds does not have an outside ad
agency; the Garnetts conceived the ad and worked with Breeze
Productions of Woodside to execute it.
</P>
<P>
   The ad targets decision-makers at the Fortune 100 companies that
are potential clients, Garnett said.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts were dubious about the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of approach to selling middleware isn't terribly
successful,'' said Ed Acly, director of middleware research at
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ``It would be more
strategic to talk about solving a problem where people are really
hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Chuck Pettis of BrandSolutions in Seattle said the
personality approach is ideal for making a brand name come alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brand is about emotion, status, culture,'' he said. ``I have
to congratulate Katrina Garnett for having the bravery to pose like
that. When she goes to a trade show, they're going to love her.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnieszka Winkler, president of Winkler Advertising in San
Francisco showed the ad to a focus group of both technical and
nontechnical people.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to the ad's content broke along gender and age lines.
``Younger women felt it was good, showing a woman who is proud to
be a woman and isn't hiding it. Older women had a hard time getting
over the fact that she was in a cocktail dress and not a suit,''
Winkler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The men didn't have an emotional response to the ad _ or were
trying to hide their response _ but couldn't understand what it was
about and what the company does,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If grabbing eyeballs is the ultimate purpose of advertising, the
ad is a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This breaks through the clutter and arrests the viewer,'' said
Andrew Hayman, executive vice president of Publicis, a San
Francisco ad agency. ``Using sex for stopping power doesn't
surprise me. Why not use the same vehicle to sell technology that
we use to sell soap or shampoo?''

``SIX DAYS'' IS LONG ON TIME, SHORT ON CAFFEINE
</HEADLINE>
 DAYS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're wondering how believable Anne Heche is as the romantic
lead in ``Six Days, Seven Nights,'' wonder no more. She has
chemistry to burn, although trailers for the movie don't help; as
Ford fishes a snake out of her shorts, you can hear the announcer
intoning ominously about Heche and her co-star Harrison Ford
exploring remote territory. There's enough subtext there to keep
French critics cranking out Freudian papers for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in her low, smoky voice there's more character than
anything Michael Browning bothered to write for her. Yes, she's the
spoiled, tense editor for ``Dazzle'' a New York fashion magazine.
Heche ends up trapped on a wild adventure with a surly pilot (Ford)
who is so tough he acts like he shaves with broken beer bottles. At
least that would explain why he's so cranky. When we first meet
him, he already has that pinched, Harrison Ford man-of-action
expression on his face, his features tweezed into a point.
Generally, it takes him about half an hour to get to that point. So
when he walks into the movie already cranked up into a full Ford,
you know he's trying to compensate for something.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrarily chasing into the territory pioneered by ``The
African Queen'' and 40 or 50 other better movies, Ford and Heche
are bound together after a mission to explore a faraway island goes
horribly wrong. He crashes the plane, and the two of them must fend
for themselves against bad guys, the uncharted wilds and the
ravages of the script; they run into everything but Gilligan and
the Skipper. The limp, perfunctory direction by Ivan Reitman makes
this attempt at action comedy seem in desperate need of a cup of
coffee, if not a fistful of Viagra. A movie full of so many obvious
turns should at least be energetic and quick, but ``Six Days, Seven
Nights'' seems to last as long as its title.
</P>
<P>
   As her boyfriend, David Schwimmer has technique to burn, and
maybe that wouldn't be such a bad idea; his confident acting style
borders on bullying. He is playing a character here closer to the
nattering, neurotic Ross from ``Friends,'' which supposedly makes
it easy to see why Heche would turn to Ford. Schwimmer is a pouty
boy, and Ford is a man. A man's man, although it turns out later in
the movie that he knows as much about contemporary fashion as any
of the miniskirted fillies you're likely to see in the halls of
``Vogue'' magazine, or an episode of ``Friends,'' for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention an older man's man. Like poor Gwyneth Paltrow in
``A Perfect Murder,'' or Halle Berry in ``Bulworth'' _ or any 40 or
50 recent pictures you could name _ Heche is paired with a man
literally old enough to be her father. In the poster for ``Six
Days, Seven Nights,'' it almost looks as if Heche is carrying Ford
to safety; and had the movie been smart enough to include a turn
like that, it might have been fun. (At least in ``Bulworth,''
Warren Beatty has the good sense to look embarrassed when Berry
busts him on being 60.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie does look good, and Ford throws himself into the
cliche. Heche rises to the occasion and gives better than she gets,
proving that she's an actress, and a good one, so her sexual
orientation has nothing to do with her onscreen presence. We can
only hope that no one in Hollywood holds this movie against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' is rated PG-13 for adult language and
cartoon-style violence.
</P>
<P>

 Net Maven Smoking Mad Over `Burn Rate'   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Net entrepreneur Isabel Maxwell is still fuming from the rough
treatment she gets in ``Burn Rate,'' Michael Wolff's story of his
own failed Internet startup.
<TEXT>
<P>
   What bugs her most is Wolff's stated reluctance to negotiate
with Maxwell; her husband, David Hayden; and her sister, Christine
Maxwell, who ran an early '90s Internet search site called
Magellan.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could anyone do business with the Maxwells?'' Wolff wrote,
alluding to the intrigue and scandal surrounding the death of their
father, Robert Maxwell, and the unraveling of his European
publishing empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a gratuitous and inaccurate reference,'' said
Maxwell, taking issue with something that others have noted about
Wolff's work _ his blow-by-blow quotes of supposedly closed-door
meetings, that make the reader feel like a fly on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff told me that none of those quotes were invented, that he
habitually took notes while he, Hayden and the Maxwell sisters were
playing ``let's make a merger.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell scoffed. ``In any of the meetings where I was present,
he never took notes,'' she said, adding, ``If he wasn't Linda
Tripping it, he was Stephen Glassing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell feels that the market has vindicated her business
acumen. ``We successfully sold our business to Excite,'' she said.
``I can't say as much for Mr. Wolff.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolff will have a chance to confess his sins next Wednesday
night at the Barnes and Noble bookstore on Stevens Creek in San
Jose, where he joins venture capitalists Ann Winblad and Rob Reid,
and journalists Jonathan Weber, Po Bronson and Chip Bayers to
discuss the perils of Internet startups.

   The company's founding team includes San Francsico investment

 Oracle's Services Unit Boosts 4th-Quarter Gain   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Oracle Corp. reported better-than-expected profits for its fiscal
fourth quarter yesterday, propelled largely by continued growth in
its technology-services business.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The company, the world's largest vendor of database software,
posted earnings of $402.8 million (41 cents a share) in the three
months ended May 31, compared with $360 million (36 cents) in the
year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street had expected the Redwood Shores firm to report a
profit of 38 cents a share, according to IBES International.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue jumped 24 percent to $2.4 billion from $1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Like many software-makers, Oracle increasingly is relying on its
computer-services arm for growth. The services business, which
helps customers install and integrate software, was Oracle's
strongest in the quarter, posting a 43 percent gain to $1.17
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Services continue to be the shining star, but we expect
license revenue to pick up in fiscal 1999,'' Gary Abbott, an
analyst at Punk Ziegel &AMP; Co., told Bloomberg Business News.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Oracle database licenses showed continued improvement,
rising 12.6 percent to $873 million. Sales of applications _
prepackaged software that works with the database _ which have been
lagging all year, fell slightly to $215.8 million from $218.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Oracle's applications &UR;  &LR; have lagged the growth rates of rivals
PeopleSoft Inc., Baan Co. and SAP of Germany for the past three
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a disappointing year for applications,'' said Jeff
Henley, Oracle's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Henley said Oracle expects new application software that started
shipping last month to help sales. The company has also revamped
its applications business _ chief executive Larry Ellison took over
the division, and the sales force was reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Results were released after the market closed. Oracle rose 6
cents to $24.31 on Nasdaq. In after-hours trading, it gained about
$2 more.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, profit rose to $955 million (96 cents) from $845
million (84 cents) in fiscal 1997. Figures for both years exclude
one-time charges related to acquisitions of Treasury Services Corp.
and Navio Communications Inc. in the past year and Datalogix in
fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Annual revenue was up 26 percent to $7.1 billion from $5.7
billion.

 AOL Up on News It Rejected AT&AMP;T   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Shares of America Online vaulted yesterday on reports that the
world's largest online service recently rebuffed a $19 billion
buyout offer from AT&AMP;T.
<TEXT>
<P>
   AOL stock rose $4.88, to $93.88, in heavy Nasdaq trading on the
heels of a published report in the Financial Times. The British
newspaper, citing unnamed sources close to both companies, said
AT&AMP;T Chairman Michael Armstrong approached AOL several weeks ago
with a takeover offer but was turned down by Chief Executive Steve
Case and Robert Pittman, chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and AOL declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's apparent interest in AOL shows the telephone giant is
willing to pay a steep price for a leading role in the fast-growing
Internet market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   An acquisition of the Dulles, Va., company would greatly expand
AT&AMP;T's online customer base and help offset its declining
long-distance business. AOL, with 12 million subscribers, dwarfs
AT&AMP;T's sputtering online service, WorldNet, which reaches 1.1
million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T isn't thrilled with its lot in the ISP market,'' said
analyst Brian Adamik, of Yankee Group in Boston. ``This way, they
would gain 12 million customers overnight and they could introduce
voice over the Internet via AOL's instant-messaging technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Case says it is ``conceivable'' that AOL will meld voice
technology into its Internet chat technology, which allows more
than 80 million Net surfers to privately exchange instant messages.
The only hitch is that AOL doesn't have enough network capacity to
provide voice communication _ and AT&AMP;T and other telecommunications
companies do.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, industry insiders splashed cold water on an
AT&AMP;T-AOL merger.
</P>
<P>
   If Case is shopping AOL, he would be more likely to pursue a
deal with WorldCom Inc., where he is a board member, analysts said.
What's more, WorldCom is awaiting federal regulatory approval of a
proposed $37 billion merger with AT&AMP;T rival MCI Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Should AT&AMP;T's bid for AOL fail, it may try to buy MSN,
Microsoft's online service, said PaineWebber analyst Jim Preissler.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T isn't the only company that covets AOL, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of interest in AOL among media powerhouses like
Disney and Time Warner,'' said Preissler, who estimates a
successful takeover bid of AOL could fetch $125 to $150 a share, or
a mind-boggling $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL's site has become prime real estate for banner ads and an
online means to promote movies, books and entertainment,''
Preissler said.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's prime-time audience of 625,000 reaches more viewers than
MTV (502,000).
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T shares improved $1.06 to $63 in trading yesterday.

 Levi's New Ads Feature `Hard Jeans'   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Stiff-as-a-board ``hard jeans,'' made from an old style of denim
not prewashed for softness, have the starring role in Levi Strauss
&AMP; Co.'s long-awaited new television advertising campaign.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The six spots, which began airing yesterday, include stiff pairs
of cuffed jeans walking straight-legged, being dipped in a vat of
dark, oily-looking liquid and falling over and hitting the ground
with a clank that sounds like a hammer hitting an anvil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Levi's brand has always been about strength, character and
quality,'' said Mark Hogan, director of consumer marketing for the
Levi's brand. ``This is a way to put it all together and do it in
an in-your-face, cutting-edge way.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also a way, Levi's hopes, to completely change the fashion
direction of the blue jeans market, which has been dominated by
soft, prewashed fabric since the early 1980s. ``We think that
creating a desire for this new look is a major opportunity to make
the jeans in peoples' wardrobes obsolete,'' said Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising experts were generally positive about the humorous
and eye-catching new ads, but they were less enthusiastic about the
featured product.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they sacrifice comfort for style and image, they will find
they are pushing the wrong buttons,'' said Erik Olson, managing
director of Greenfield Consulting, a consumer research firm.
``There clearly is a comfort mentality in the U.S. now,'' even
among the 15- to 21-year-old males targeted by the ads, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hogan asserts that stiff denim is a growing trend in
the marketplace. Sales of Levi's vintage jeans, made from the
old-style fabric, have grown noticeably in the past year. Other
companies, such as Diesel, are also selling hard jeans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important look that's happening, and since we've
owned it over time, it's important that we continue to own it,''
Hogan said. Young consumers who buy the jeans will also discover
the characteristic that made them popular in earlier generations _
the jeans become soft and comfortable over time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, created by TBWA Chiat/Day, represents a
significant departure from Levi's last round of TV ads, which were
developed by the company's former ad agency Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding
/San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier spots, which featured gritty, urban characters, a
disjointed story line and obscure cultural references, were
designed to update Levi's brand image. The current spots focus
completely on the product.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan said the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. ``Our
product is the key element of the brand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will run through the end of the year on NBC, Fox,
and cable networks that include MTV and ESPN. Ten to 12 new spots
will be added over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   TBWA Chiat/Day is also preparing magazine and radio ads, as well
as billboards that will come on top of two other recent billboard
campaigns. The company declined to disclose the cost of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's good about this campaign is that they're going back to
talking about Levi's,'' said Liz Dunning, a senior vice president
with Addison, a brand-consulting firm. ``Also, this approach gives
Levi's a point of differentiation in a jeans market that has become
very generic.''

 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday jettisoned broad
legislation meant to discourage teen-agers from smoking, the most
ambitious and contentious measure before Congress, and left almost
no hope it could be revived this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which had been debated on the Senate floor for a
month, was set aside when supporters, mostly Democrats, could not
get the 60 votes needed to clear two procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats promised to bring the matter up again at every
opportunity this year, but they conceded that they had little
chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the final vote on this bill occurs on Election
Day,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents of the bill, which would have raised the
price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack, argued that it was not
primarily an anti-smoking measure but a tax increase to pay for
government programs. ``This is a massive tax on low-income
Americans, and it is used to proliferate the bureaucracy of this
government,'' declared Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain, the maverick Republican from Arizona who
was the bill's chief sponsor, emphasized the importance of stopping
teen-agers from getting hooked on smoking. ``This bill is not about
taxes,'' he told the Senate just before the votes. ``It's about
whether we're going to allow the death march of 418,000 Americans a
year who die early from tobacco-related disease and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who favors strong anti-smoking legislation,
criticized the Senate, blamed the tobacco companies and their
advertising campaign for the bill's defeat and made it clear that
he would use the issue for partisan purposes in the fall's
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been working for three years now to protect our
children from the dangers of tobacco,'' Clinton said in an
impromptu appearance in the White House briefing room on Wednesday
evening. ``I want the tobacco lobby and its allies on Capitol Hill
to know that from my point of view, the battle is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, said The Senate was so
divided on the issue that it was impossible to produce a bill that
would command the 60 votes needed in the Senate to pass contentious
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On the crucial vote, 57 senators voted to cut off debate and
move to a final vote, a procedure called cloture. But that was
three votes shy of 60 votes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three Democrats and 14 Republicans voted in favor of
cloture. Forty Republicans and two Democrats from tobacco states,
Wendell Ford of Kentucky and Charles Robb of Virginia, voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Senate dealt the final blow by voting to send the bill
back to the Commerce Committee. It would have required 60 votes to
prevent this, and the supporters fell seven votes short.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have been
waiting to see what happened in the Senate before they acted on a
tobacco bill. They are opposed to ambitious legislation like the
Senate bill. The word in the House on Wednesday night was that the
leaders might still try to pass some low-budget alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Wednesday night, House Speaker Newt Gingrich
said: ``It is our intent to take up and pass effective legislation
that is narrowly focused on anti-teen smoking, anti-drug efforts.
Our goal is to reduce teen smoking, not increase taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising the price of cigarettes over the next
five years, the Senate measure would have given the government new
authority to regulate tobacco advertising and marketing and imposed
stiff penalties on cigarette makers if the rate of teen-age smoking
did not fall to specified levels.
</P>
<P>
   But amendments added in the Senate in the last few weeks would
have given a tax break to married couples and established new
programs against drug abuse. These measures will die with the
overall bill, though they might be added to other legislation
before the year is out.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was prompted to take up the tobacco issue by the
settlement signed a year ago this Saturday by the major tobacco
companies and the attorneys general from 40 states. Under the
agreement, the industry would have paid $368.5 billion over the
next 25 years and agreed to restraints on tobacco advertising. In
return, they would have been given immunity from most lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The settlement required congressional action before it could go
into effect. Without a federal law, the states are expected to
press their multibillion-dollar legal claims against the tobacco
companies. Individuals may also be more likely to go to court now,
especially in light of the decision by a jury in Florida last week
to find the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. liable for a smoker's
death.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill came out of McCain's committee in April on a
19-to-1 bipartisan vote, its prospects for approval seemed good.
But the tobacco companies rebelled when they realized that the
Senate was not going to protect them from lawsuits, and began a
national advertising campaign against the bill said to cost tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters said that the ads turned the tide, much as
ads by insurance companies were held responsible for defeating
President Clinton's health-care plan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies have made a very wise investment, and
they have won,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duchesne, a spokesman retained by the tobacco industry,
said that the Senate action on Wednesday was ``evidence the public
came to understand what was in the bill.'' Higher taxes, he said,
would not have solved the youth smoking problem.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side, C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon
general, said: ``I hope that the senators who derailed this bill
today lose sleep every night listening to the sound of children
taking their first puff and the sound of emphysema and cancer
patients gasping for their last breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop, who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush,
added, ``I hope it keeps the Republican leadership awake, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCain, knowing he was facing defeat and clearly deflated by the
experience, gave a speech unusually critical of his own party. He
noted that some of his colleagues had said that the action on the
tobacco legislation would define the Republican Party, and he
continued:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Mr. President, there may be something to that.
Because maybe we ought to remember the obligations that we incur
when we govern America. Maybe we ought to remember the principles
of the founder of our party. We might want to understand that our
obligation first of all is to those who can't care for themselves
in this society, and that includes our children. Shouldn't it
define the Republican Party that we should do everything we can to
handle this scourge, this disease that is rampant throughout young
children in America? Doesn't that define the Republican Party?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain then put down his microphone and walked off the Senate
floor. Across the aisle, in an extremely unusual gesture,
Democratic senators stood and applauded. Republicans remained
silent in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's votes came after a day of huddles by leaders from
both parties to count votes. Republicans said that Lott had made
clear that he would allow no votes until he was sure his side would
win.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats left no doubt that they would use the issue in the
congressional election campaigns this fall and portray Republicans
as tools of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The question before the Senate, said Sen. Kent Conrad of North
Dakota, was ``Do we protect our children's lives or do we protect
the profits of the tobacco industry?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,
declared: ``This bill may be dead. But tobacco legislation is not
dead. We will not let this issue die. We will come back. We will
keep at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans seemed unfazed by such arguments, confident
that the public was more concerned about a tax increase than about
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill breaks the budget,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader.

 Microsoft Sets Its Sites on Home Loans   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Do you trust Bill Gates to pick your mortgage broker?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft is betting you will. The software giant plans to
launch a new Web site this summer to help home buyers find
mortgages and houses.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Called Home Advisor, the site will be Microsoft's third
electronic commerce venture. The Redmond, Wash., firm already runs
successful Web sites selling cars and airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be acting in General Electric style, by having a
top site in each category,'' said Chris Stevens, analyst at the
Aberdeen Group in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they increase their Internet properties, they have the
ability to cross-reference their listings and find out more about
people,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft announced its intention to get into the $10 billion
online real estate and mortgage market last year and confirmed
yesterday it will launch Home Advisor this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While Microsoft was building its site, dozens of competitors are
already vying to cater to home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   In the online mortgage business, top players include HomeShark
of San Francisco and E-Loan of Palo Alto, which are both
celebrating their one-year anniversaries this month, and Intuit of
Mountain View, which is preparing the third version of its
8-month-old QuickenMortgage Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In the real estate listings business, top sites include the
National Association of Realtors, which has already got 95 percent
of the market covered with its Realtor.Com site, and
Minneapolis-based CyberHomes, which has amassed 75 percent of the
nation's home listings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its late entry, many are betting that Microsoft will
bulldoze its way into a top spot in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time Microsoft comes into an electronic service, it puts
an 800-pound gorilla in the ring,'' said Vernon Keenan, senior
analyst at Zona Research in Redwood City.
</P>
<P>
   But most online home-buying services are reluctant to speak
badly of their soon-to-be competitor. Instead, they say they hope
Microsoft's arrival will grow the market for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest competition is not Microsoft, it's simply making
people aware that (buying a mortgage online) is an option,'' said
Ned Hoyt, CEO of HomeShark. ``I'm happy to have Microsoft to spend
the money to do that for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some competitors have begun gearing up for Microsoft's
arrival. E-Loan started blanketing the Seattle area with ads three
weeks ago and is currently raising $10 million for a nationwide ad
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a little bit of a trust issue with Microsoft,'' said
E-Loan CEO Chris Larsen. ``We think people will probably wonder,
`Are they going to sell my data?' We would never ever do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen said he hopes to show consumers that they will get a
better deal by buying a mortgage directly through E-Loan rather
than by getting a referral to a loan officer from the Microsoft
site.
</P>
<P>
   That's because E-Loan _ as well as HomeShark and Intuit _ offers
customers a break on the commissions usually charged by loan
brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The online brokers charge about 0.5 percent of the mortgage,
while an ``offline'' loan officer usually charges between 1 and 2
percent commission.
</P>
<P>
   Because Microsoft is referring customers to loan officers rather
than writing loans itself, it cannot offer similar savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't tell customers that you're saving them thousands
of dollars, then why (would they) bother'' buying a loan online,
said Keenan, the Zona analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit realized just that after launching its mortgage site last
fall using the referral model. In March of this year, Intuit
switched to originating loans _ and giving home buyers a price
break _ instead of simply charging mortgage bankers for customer
referrals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've evolved quite a bit,'' said Alison Berkley, senior
product manager for QuickenMortgage.
</P>
<P>
   However, she said she is worried that Microsoft will repeat its
Web browser strategy: Gain market share by giving away products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What concerns us the most is if they destroy the entire
economics of the industry,'' Berkley said. ``Because of their deep
pockets, they have the ability to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft product manager Larry Cohen dismissed the notion the
company would give anything away on its site. He said he doesn't
expect Microsoft to displace any competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not focused on beating HomeShark or beating Intuit,''
Cohen said. ``There's room for multiple players. It's not one
winner takes all.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the area of real estate listings, Microsoft may even have
some catching up to do. Home Advisor is slated to launch with
complete real estate listings for some _ but not all _ metropolitan
areas, while its competitors have amassed sizable portions of the
U.S. market. Microsoft hasn't yet said which locales it will
target.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Realtor.Com has 1.2 million home listings _ out of
the roughly 1.3 million listings in the nation, according to
Michael Keller, vice president of marketing at RealSelect Inc. in
Westlake Village (Los Angeles County), which produces the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can see how Microsoft will have a challenge gaining a
foothold in an industry where a leader like us is already
established,'' Keller said.

ALBRIGHT'S REMARKS ON IRAN: `KHATAMI DESERVES RESPECT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (with IRAN-ALBRIGHT)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Following are excerpts from Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's speech last night to the Asia Society in New
York, as prepared for delivery and provided by the State
Department:
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office, President Khatami has responded to the
demands of the Iranian people by emphasizing the importance of
dialogue among nations and cultures, and by acknowledging the
world's growing interdependence. He has said that ``a society
intending to reach development cannot succeed without understanding
Western civilization.'' I would say, in response, that the same can
be said with respect to Eastern civilization and Islamic
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   President Khatami has said that the American government deserves
respect because it is a reflection of the great American people. I
would say that President Khatami deserves respect because he is the
choice of the Iranian people. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In past years, Iran's opposition to the Middle East peace
process and to those willing to negotiate with Israel has been
vitriolic and violent. The Islamic Republic still refuses to
recognize Israel, and its leaders continue to denounce Israel in
inflammatory and unacceptable terms.
</P>
<P>
   But last December, Iranian officials welcomed Chairman Arafat to
the Islamic summit in Tehran and said that, although they did not
agree with the logic of the peace process, they would not seek to
impose their views and would accept what the Palestinians could
accept.
</P>
<P>
   In January, President Khatami publicly denounced terrorism and
condemned the killing of innocent Israelis. He argued that
terrorism was not only against Islam but also counterproductive to
Iran's purposes. Iran, after all, has also been a victim of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   If these views are translated into a rejection of terrorism as a
tool of Iranian statecraft, it would do much to dispel the concerns
of the international community from Germany to the Persian Gulf,
and from Argentina to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   There are other signs of change, as well. For example, Iran's
record in the war against drugs has greatly improved _ at least
within its own borders _ and it has received high marks from the
U.N. for its treatment of more than two million Iraqi and Afghan
refugees. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The United States opposes _ and will continue to oppose _ any
country selling or transferring to Iran materials and technologies
that could be used to develop long-range missiles or weapons of
mass destruction. Similarly, we oppose Iranian efforts to sponsor
terror. Accordingly, our economic policies, including with respect
to the export pipelines for Caspian oil and gas, remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   But let me be clear. These policies are not _ as some Iranians
allege _ anti-Islamic. Islam is the fastest-growing religious faith
in the United States. We respect deeply its moral teachings and its
role as a source of inspiration and instruction for hundreds of
millions of people around the world. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We are ready to explore further ways to build mutual confidence
and avoid misunderstandings. The Islamic Republic should consider
parallel steps. If such a process can be initiated and sustained in
a way that addresses the concerns of both sides, then we in the
United States can see the prospect of a very different
relationship. As the wall of mistrust comes down, we can develop
with the Islamic Republic, when it is ready, a road map leading to
normal relations.

 Independent Counsel Online   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Kenneth Starr may be grabbing most of the headlines for his
four-year probe of President Clinton. But he's not the only
independent counsel searching for crimes in the executive branch or
the first to set up his own Internet site to publicize results.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That honor goes to Daniel Smaltz, who since 1994 has been
tracking down alleged abuses of power by former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy.
</P>
<P>
   After Starr, Smaltz has garnered the most publicity _ both kudos
and criticism _ for that long-running probe, which has California
connections. Sun-Diamond Growers and one of its former executives
were charged with providing illegal gratuities. And Robert Mondavi
Corp. was questioned last month about its connection with Espy.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz also recently set up the first Office of Independent
Counsel Web site ( &LR; www.oic.gov &LR; ) to provide an update on
prosecutions as well as legal briefs, press releases and speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the Web site,'' Smaltz said, ``I hope the public will
develop an informed understanding of the role of the Independent
Counsel in investigating allegations of wrongdoing by high-ranking
government officials.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first week of its operation, the Web site attracted
3,330 hits. But traffic quickly tapered off to about one-tenth that
total in later weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Espy is long gone. He left office under a
cloud in 1994. But the investigation by Smaltz and 10 other
attorneys into Espy's alleged acceptance of more than $35,000 in
illegal gratuities from companies and individuals regulated by his
department, goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The Smaltz team has won 10 guilty verdicts and recovered $10.5
million in criminal fines and civil penalties, said Deputy
Independent Counsel Ted Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Like Starr, Smaltz's investigation has generated plenty of
controversy. And some of his targets, including Espy's brother
Henry, have been acquitted or had convictions against them
overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   California's Sun-Diamond Growers was found guilty and fined $1.5
million for giving illegal gifts worth about $6,000 _ including
luggage and a Waterford crystal bowl filled with nuts _ to the
former agriculture secretary.
</P>
<P>
   But this past March, a three-judge panel reversed that
conviction because the jury was given improper instructions. Smaltz
is asking for a rehearing.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you won't find on the Smaltz Web site is just how much
he has spent on his investigation. After several phone calls,
Greenberg said that the Smaltz probe has cost taxpayers $14,832,985
through last September, including $2.5 million in the most recently
tabulated six-month period.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the investigations by Starr and his predecessor
into Whitewater and other Clinton capers have cost more than $35
million through last September.
</P>
<P>
   You also won't discover online the latest twists and turns in
Smaltz's investigation, such as the recent grilling of Robert
Mondavi Corp. The Napa Valley winemaker confirmed that last month
Smaltz's office asked its government affairs manager Herbert
Schmidt to testify about a 1993 visit by Espy to view vineyard
damage caused by the root louse phylloxera. The tour was hosted by
Mondavi.
</P>
<P>
   Winery spokesman Bob Philipps would only say that the company
and its attorneys ``are cooperating fully with the office of
Independent Counsel and will have no further comment at this
time.'' Smaltz's office declined comment on whether Mondavi is
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz's biggest hit was against Tyson Foods. The big Arkansas
poultry producer pleaded guilty to providing $12,000 in illegal
gratuities to Espy and agreed to pay a whopping $4 million fine and
$2 million more to cover government investigation costs.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Espy paid a $50,000 fine for using money from his
previous congressional campaigns to help pay his more than $300,000
in legal bills stemming from the independent counsel probe.
However, Espy continues to deny he is guilty of accepting illegal
gifts and awaits trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Espy suffered a setback when a three-judge panel of
the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling and
reinstated three charges against him. (The charges are the only
ones in the 39-count indictment that carry a mandatory prison term
of at least one year each.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The charges are predicated on politics,'' said one lawyer who
insisted on anonymity because his corporate client remains a Smaltz
target. ``They start with the premise that a government official
must be guilty of something and then they have unlimited resources
and time to make a case.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Starr, Smaltz also has been criticized for making a big
deal out of seemingly small transgressions. &UR;  &LR; But Deputy Independent
Counsel Greenberg, who last month was anointed Smaltz's media
spokesman, replacing Charles Bakaly who took a similar post under
Starr, strongly disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because the amount is small doesn't make the crime any
less serious,'' he said. ``There has to be confidence in
government. Social interests have to be vindicated and this can't
necessarily be done on a dollar-for-dollar basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaltz has been speaking out against those who have demonized
the 15 independent counsels appointed over the past 20 years and
labeled them as partisan loonies. Like Starr, Smaltz's team charges
that a major reason for the lengthy investigation and mounting cost
are delay tactics and endless appeals by the targets of the probes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, if the independent counsels investigating Clinton
and a handful of his former cabinet officers were judged strictly
by return on investment, they might be out of business.
</P>
<P>
   With unlimited budgets and sometimes unfocused objectives,
special investigations into the executive branch of government have
cost taxpayers about $150 million since 1985, including $47 million
spent on the seven-year, Iran-Contra affair during the Reagan-Bush
era.
</P>
<P>
   The first independent counsel law was passed by Congress in 1978
in the wake of Watergate. Since President Clinton signed the
Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act four years ago this month,
the bill run up by the independent counsels is approaching $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ordinary prosecutors who investigate a particular known
crime, independent counsels start when there is information a crime
may have occurred and they have near unlimited latitude and funds
to fish into most anything.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 15 publicly identified independent counsels, six have
brought criminal prosecutions following their investigations. In
the Clinton era, these include David Barrett for ongoing charges
against former Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros, Starr
and Smaltz.

EDITORIAL: ACCEPTING FOR `CITIZEN KANE' ... 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the American Film Institute's much publicized list
of the 100 best American movies of all time is simply a marketing
device for studios with a lot of old videos to sell. If so, it is a
pretty good one. It was hard to watch the three-hour CBS countdown
of the golden hundred Tuesday evening without making mental notes
of things to rent during the next rainy season. ``Grapes of Wrath''
seems to be aging very well.
</P>
<P>
   Most lists of the best of anything suffer from an overemphasis
on things that happened during the rankers' lifetimes. But the Film
Institute went way overboard, picking only four silent movies,
three of them starring Charlie Chaplin. The only world in which
``Dances With Wolves'' is more important than ``Intolerance'' is
the one that exists at Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   A list chosen by a committee, whatever its agenda, is probably
never going to be as interesting as selections made by a single
person, where all the quirks of individuality can be given full
rein.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich's all-time favorite movie list,
which he shared with The Times, includes three John Wayne features
as well as ``Being There,'' the Peter Sellers classic about a man
who convinces the world he is a genius by repeating the blandest
possible truisms. After nearly four years of running the Republican
majority in the House, Gingrich seems unclear whether victory
belongs to the brave and the well armed, or simply to those who say
dumb things with conviction.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker also nominated the entire ``Pink Panther'' series, a
choice that suggests an interest in productions that start strong
and gradually degenerate into pointless incoherence.
</P>
<P>
   There is going to be an orgy of list-making leading up to the
year 2000, on every topic from best literature to best snacks. Time
magazine has already weighed in on the most influential comic-strip
character of the century (Bart Simpson). The Washington Post Style
section named Genghis Khan the Man of the Millennium way back in
1995, and a survey of history professors more recently selected
Adolf Hitler as the ``most significant person of the century.''
Unlike the movies, history does not always favor the virtuous.

SPORTS COLUMN: JUST KEEP HITTING YOUR TITANIUM DRIVER
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you're a golfer with one of those high-tech
titanium drivers, you can still hit the ball longer and straighter
and you can still hit it out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a month, the golf underground had warned that the
guardian of the game, the U.S. Golf Association, was about to ban
all those Big Berthas, Titleist 975Ds, Ping TiSi's, Taylor Ti
Bubbles and King Cobra Ti's that were providing touring pros and
duffers with more yards off the tee.
</P>
<P>
   For any golfer, only one development could be worse: closing
your favorite 19th hole.
</P>
<P>
   But sanity, if not sympathy, has prevailed. Wednesday, on the
eve of the 98th U.S. Open, the association announced a proposal
instead of a punishment. It also indicated that virtually all the
clubs submitted for USGA testing that are now on the market will
conform to the eventual standard.
</P>
<P>
   Your titanium clubs not only are legal, but they will also
apparently remain legal even after the U.S.G.A. announces that
standard sometime in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   That standard will involve a golf phrase that is suddenly as
important as ``greens in regulation.'' The phrase is ``spring-like
effect,'' meaning the rebound velocity of a golf ball off the face
of a club. Those words have been in the Rules of Golf since 1984,
but only vaguely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The material and the construction of the club,'' Rule 4-1e of
Appendix II reads, ``shall not have the effect at impact of a
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   David Fay, the association's executive director, said all clubs
have had some spring-like effect in the literal sense ``because all
clubs deform at impact.'' As examples, Fay mentioned Bobby Jones'
driver in 1930, the wooden-headed drivers used in the 1987 Open
here at Olympic and the metal drivers that Tiger Woods and the
other touring pros are using in this Open.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said: ``We don't believe that the spring-like effect in
clubs that are presently in use have lessened the skill required to
play the game at championships such as the U.S. Open or at the
recreational level. With an eye to the future, we have a
responsibility to set objective, clearly understood standards that
anticipate emerging technology.''
</P>
<P>
   The concern, said F. Morgan ``Buzz'' Taylor, Jr., the USGA
president, is ``what's around the corner,'' not what's in your
corner discount store or club pro shop.
</P>
<P>
   What may be around that corner is what is known in Japan as
``the Yamaguchi patent.'' Owned by Dunlop, it produces what is
known as ``impedance matching of club and ball.''
</P>
<P>
   That's high-tech talk for a spring-like effect that would add
distance, perhaps beyond whatever standard the USGA defines in the
next few weeks before its meeting with club manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people that have an aerospace or high-metal
technology background now involved in golf,'' added Taylor, who was
once a Princeton football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our own consultants, who are pretty wise in these matters,
have suggested there are certain materials which may create a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the USGA intends to draw a line not on titanium but
on the high-tech metals on the horizon. Plutonium? Uranium?
</P>
<P>
   But for whatever extra distance the high-tech metals create,
they won't change the essence of better scoring: putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have to putt,'' said David Duval, who has won five
PGA Tour events since last October.
</P>
<P>
   And the USGA standard won't diminish golf's research and
development. Ely Callaway, who popularized the Big Bertha, the
Great Big Bertha and the Biggest Big Bertha drivers, looked to the
eventual standard as a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will increase research and development,'' Callaway said,
``because whatever further restrictions do come, we need to be more
ingenious.''
</P>
<P>
   During the USGA news conference, John Daly, wearing a Callaway
cap, stood in the back and listened. Hardly a disinterested
bystander, he is No. 1 on the PGA Tour in driving distance with a
297-yard average on the measured holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand any of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Daly understands that he can still tee off with his Biggest
Big Bertha and that is all he cares about. And that is all any
golfer with a titanium club cares about.  &QL;

ONE-MAN GRAND JURY APPOINTED TO PROBE MOXLEY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDITH GAINES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a highly unusual legal move in Connecticut, a one-man grand
jury has been appointed to investigate the unsolved 1975 slaying of
15-year-old Martha Moxley, state officials announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's chief court administrator, Aaron Ment, confirmed
the appointment of Superior Court Justice George Thim, a veteran
state judge, as the grand juror in the highly charged case, said
Karen Berris, manager of communications for the Connecticut
Judicial Branch.
</P>
<P>
   Legal analysts say it is the first time since 1993 that a grand
jury has been called in Connecticut _ an indication, perhaps, of
the political sensitivities surrounding the case.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley, who was beaten and stabbed with shafts from a golf club,
was found dead in her own yard in Belle Haven, a posh section of
Greenwich, Conn., on Oct. 31, 1975. The golf club was traced to the
home of Rushton Skakel, the brother of Ethel Kennedy, who lived
near the Moxleys.
</P>
<P>
   During the ensuing investigation, Thomas and Michael Skakel, two
of Skakel's teenage sons, were identified as possible suspects, but
no one has been charged with a crime in the case. Investigators say
they were hampered by the apparent lack of witnesses or substantial
physical evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Frank Garr, who has led the investigation, would not
discuss specific discoveries that may have triggered the call for a
grand jury. But he said, ``We've talked to hundreds of people,
gathered information that was previously unknown, found some facts
and circumstances that were not known. So we reached a point where
having a grand jury was an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Garr insisted the publication of three books dealing with the
Moxley killing did not affect the decision to hold a grand jury.
The books include a fictionalized account, ``A Season in
Purgatory,'' by Dominick Dunne; and more recently, two nonfiction
accounts, ``Greentown,'' by Timothy Dumas, and ``Murder in
Greenwich,'' by Mark Fuhrman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The books added interest from the public and the media. But
they had no impact on the investigation,'' Garr said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, a grand jury must be called for any felony
conviction. But in Connecticut, grand juries have not been required
since 1983. There, criminal complaints typically proceed through
use of ``an information,'' a document that notifies a defendant of
charges and is signed by a prosecutor after an arrest warrant has
been issued.
</P>
<P>
   Berris said that only seven grand juries have been called in
Connecticut since 1985. The last one involved alleged corruption in
the Hartford Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand juries in Connecticut are only used for political
purposes,'' said Norman Pattis, a partner in the law firm of
William, Polan &AMP; Pattis, in New Haven. He said that having a grand
jury provides insulation for a prosecutor in a politically
sensitive case, because the decision to indict is made by a panel
of anonymous citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way of denying accountability,'' Pattis said. ``If
you're going to strike high, at a popular target, strike
anonymously.''
</P>
<P>
   The grisly killing appalled the residents of Belle Haven, who
regarded their baronial neighborhood as exclusive and secure.
Singer Diana Ross, humorist Victor Borge, filmmaker Joseph E.
Levine, and many corporate executives live there. Donald Trump gave
Marla Maples her engagement ring there. Residents of its
approximately 40 mansions support a 10-man squad of private police
to provide round-the-clock protection.
</P>
<P>
   And when some children of the elite, including Martha Moxley,
partied at the Skakel home on the evening of Oct. 30, 1975, ``we
thought it was about as safe as playing in the kitchen,'' a member
of the group told The Boston Globe in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley was last seen engaging in ``horseplay'' with Thomas
Skakel at about 9:30 p.m., investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Investigators say their inquiries also focused on Kenneth W.
Littleton Jr. of Belmont, Mass., a former live-in tutor for the
Skakel children.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after 9:30 p.m., police say, Moxley met her attacker
outside her home. Her mother remembers hearing a commotion, but was
not alarmed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon the next day, a girlfriend found Moxley's
body on the family estate, hidden by the low-hanging limbs of a
pine tree. A coroner described the cause of death as ``multiple
lacerations of the scalp with fractures of the skull and contusions
and lacerations of the brain.'' Moxley's jeans and underpants had
been removed, but investigators say they found no proof of sexual
assault.

NAILON STAYING AT TCU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOEL ANDERSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU center Lee Nailon has withdrawn from
consideration for Wednesday's NBA draft and will return for his
senior season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Nailon, a third-team Associated Press All-American
and the Western Athletic Conference Pacific Division player of the
year, said he decided to return to TCU to improve his skills and
his stock for next year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great deal of basketball ahead of me,'' Nailon said
in a statement. ``I feel by coming back I can improve my game and
can improve my position in next year's NBA draft.''
</P>
<P>
   When he announced in April that he would enter the draft, Nailon
said he would return to TCU if he was not assured by NBA scouts
that he would be among the first 15 players drafted.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts had projected Nailon as a small forward. After several
poor performances at the Pre-Draft NBA Camp this month in Chicago,
Nailon was projected as a late first-round or early second-round
pick.
</P>
<P>
   NBA scouting director Marty Blake had recommended that Nailon
return for his final season of eligibility to improve his strength,
ball-handling skills and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a good, smart player, but he's not ready to go,'' Blake
said. ``At Chicago, he found out that he needed work on his ball
handling. If he goes back to school, it will help him emotionally,
physically and educationally.''
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Billy Tubbs was pleased with Nailon's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think Lee made a wise decision by taking some
advice from the NBA people,'' Tubbs said. ``I think it's great for
TCU, the team and for our entire program.''
</P>
<P>
   Nailon's decision could cause a logjam for the Horned Frogs.
Tubbs signed nine players to scholarships for next season, in
addition to the six scholarship players currently on the team. NCAA
rules allow Division I men's basketball programs to have 13
athletes on scholarship. However, freshman signees Toshay Harvey, a
6-2 guard from Houston Sharpstown and Justin Lyman, a 6-7 forward
from Fort Bend Elkins, have not made qualifying scores on the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   After transferring from Butler County (Kan.) Community College,
Nailon led the Horned Frogs to a 27-6 season, including a 14-0
record in the WAC, a No. 13 ranking in the AP Top 25 and TCU's
first NCAA Tournament bid since 1987. Nailon finished last season
as the nation's third-leading scorer at 24.9 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to return to TCU and help this team to continue to
build upon the success we enjoyed last year, while continuing my
education,'' Nailon said. ``I have every desire to complete my
degree at TCU.''

OPEN'S '98 LEGACY WILL BE A ROUGH RIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Of all the golf courses to hold a U.S. Open, few
have been as open to the offbeat occurrence as the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Long after Casey Martin's tire tracks fade from its fairways,
history will remember the 6,797-yard, par-70 layout as the first
Open venue to welcome a golf cart during a competitive round. That
will become Olympic's latest claim to fame when Martin joins 155
fellow competitors in today's opening round.
</P>
<P>
   But it is far from the club's only unique contribution to the
golf world during Open week. It is also the only place where Ben
Hogan, the most prolific winner in Open history, lost an 18-hole
playoff to determine the 1955 title. It was the site of Arnold
Palmer's implosion in 1966, when he blew a seven-stroke lead over
the final nine holes _ the greatest giveaway in Open history _ and
lost to Billy Casper.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday afternoon, MasterCard Colonial champ Tom Watson
predicts that Olympic will be remembered for something else: the
first over-par winning score at a U.S. Open since Jimmy Carter sat
in the Oval Office in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how much over par it's going to be, but I think
this year, we are definitely going to see an over-par score win the
tournament,'' said Watson, who based his prediction on fast, dry
conditions during practice rounds and a gnarly, 5-inch blanket of
rough that several players have described as the most punitive they
have seen at an Open venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I say that,'' Watson said, ``is we're due for some
wind. And when it starts blowing, it's going to be difficult to
shoot par around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with pristine conditions, Tom Lehman said, players will
struggle to hit Olympic's tiny greens and sloping fairways. More
so, in Lehman's opinion, than at most Open venues. In his mind,
that helps explain why three underdogs _ Jack Fleck (1955), Casper
(1966) and Scott Simpson (1987) _ won the first three Opens held at
Olympic over more heralded runner-ups Hogan, Palmer and Watson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a little bit more chance involved here. I think that
is the one thing about the course that makes it difficult and a
little unpredictable,'' Lehman said. ``There are about four or five
holes out there where ... you can hit a really good shot and still
be in the rough if you draw the ball instead of hitting a slight
cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, that is a pretty fine line. But that's how fine a
line it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The course's 5-inch blend of bluegrass and poa annua rough makes
chipping from the tall grass a dice roll as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very interesting because playing out of there is
all luck,'' Tiger Woods said. ``This rough is different. It's
clumpy. You can have a ball were you see it on TV and it looks
playable, but there's a huge clump of grass behind the ball and the
guy can't get a club on it. Or you can have what looks like a bad
lie, but you can be behind the clump and it's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman disagrees. He said he has a standing bet with a fellow
player that no one will be able to reach a par-4 hole in regulation
this week after driving the ball into the rough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have dropped balls all over, and I can't hit more than a
sand wedge out,'' Lehman said. ``I just don't think it's possible
unless you get lucky. I mean, you'd be really, really, really lucky
to get the ball to the green from the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   With luck expected to play a major role in deciding the outcome,
Simpson said a larger-than-usual number of starters in the field
could wind up winning on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you would have 50 guys who could win this
tournament,'' Simpson said, listing one-event winners Jeff Maggert
of Houston and David Ogrin of San Antonio as likely contenders.
``People always crack me up when they say there are only five or 10
guys who can win. You've got to be kidding me.''
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is the Olympic Club. When the PGA Tour brought
its season-ending event, the Tour Championship, to the course in
1993-94, the eventual winners were Jim Gallagher Jr. and Mark
McCumber. Neither player is currently listed in the top 100 of the
world golf rankings or the PGA Tour season money list.
</P>
<P>
   How tolerant is Olympic of the underdog? Martin, a Nike Tour
participant, clipped Woods, the world's top-ranked player, for $30
in a skins competition during their Tuesday practice round.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is assured the notoriety of becoming the first Open
competitor to use a golf cart, Martin said he expects more from his
initial appearance in a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be really disappointed if I didn't make the cut
here,'' Martin said. ``I think this course sets up well for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if it doesn't, Martin will at least leave some historic
tire tracks. And the Olympic Club will make another unique
contribution to Open annals.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would be so easy to just give in and put Hanson on
the cover. All those feverish letters piling up in her office, a
mini-riot on notebook paper, and what they all want is just one
simple thing, so why not get it over with and just put Hanson on
the cover?
</P>
<P>
   Because it would be wrong, Christina Ferrari says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I just took those letters at face value, I would have
Hanson on my cover,'' said Ms. Ferrari, managing editor of the
highly successful Teen People, Time Inc.'s new young person's guide
to the world of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But editorially, right now, that isn't where we want to go.
It's a little young for us. Which is not to say I would never put
Hanson on the cover. But right now, we're looking at celebrities
with a slightly older appeal. So it's really, you know, it's not
that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, it seems, is terribly simple in the pitiless arena of
teen magazines, where nuances of cover lines are as carefully
calibrated as precision weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanson problem is typical: because most of the pop group's
fans are at the younger edge of the spectrum, between 11 and 14,
the group's presence on a magazine cover might send a disastrously
wrong signal to the more desirable readers at the upper end, from
16 to 18, which is Teen People's playground.
</P>
<P>
   As parents and advertising agencies know, the difference in
habits and spending power of those groups is incalculable, and Teen
People is determined not to stumble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fine line we walk with teen-agers,'' she said, sighing
philosophically. ``You can't be too young or too old.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Ms. Ferrari and her team have traversed that line quite
proficiently. Teen People began in February, and after just five
issues, Time Inc. announced last week that it was raising the
magazine's rate base _ the circulation figure that it guarantees
advertisers _ to 800,000 copies from 500,000. Several issues have
sold more than one million copies; not close to Seventeen, the
market leader at 2.6 million, but quite impressive for a start-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's had very good growth for a new publication,'' said Bob
Huff, director of planning operations for DDB Needham, the
advertising agency, which has placed several clients in the
magazine. ``But then again, they come from a good family.''
</P>
<P>
   The parent, of course, is the grown-up People Weekly, the
ultimate journal of celebrity, which plenty of teen-agers already
borrowed from their parents to learn about their favorite actors
and rock stars.
</P>
<P>
   Teen People, which borrows heavily from the format and bureau
system of the adult version, is like a training manual for
adolescents not quite ready for a lifetime fascination with
entertainment but eager to take that first step.
</P>
<P>
   Like its parent, it also has a mixture of articles about
subjects like bulimia, interracial dating and fraternity hazing
among the movie stars and the hero profiles. (It avoids the
boy-crazy articles of its competitors, but has just as many fashion
and beauty tips.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The People brand is so familiar and trusted and liked by so
many people,'' Ms. Ferrari said. ``People write in and say, `I
always read my parents' copy of People, and now I have my own and
that's so great, because it focuses just on the people I'm
interested in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And fortunately for Teen People, Time Inc. found in Ms. Ferrari,
33, who is just as interested in teen-age culture _ the television
shows, the music, the pressures of burgeoning sexuality and style _
as the readers are. Until last year, she was editor in chief of YM,
a monthly for teen-age girls, and has also worked at McCalls,
Redbook and Self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably would watch those TV shows even if I didn't have
to,'' she said this week in her office in the Time-Life building.
``MTV is like background music for my life. In fact, I joke with my
husband about what I'm going to do when I no longer edit a magazine
for teens, because I'm going to need a new excuse for watching all
of this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferrari, a native of Los Altos, Calif., who graduated from
the University of California at Berkeley, said she was a ``serious
and intense'' teen-ager who is now having the fun that she should
have had more of back then.
</P>
<P>
   She said she admires the enthusiasm and lack of cynicism in
today's generation of teen-agers, although she never tries to dress
or talk like one, and deliberately keeps slang out of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen-agers want to use slang with each other but they don't
want to see it in their magazine,'' she said. ``They know it's a
bunch of editors in New York trying to talk like teen-agers. I
mean, how fake is that?''
</P>
<P>
   She and her postadolescent staff rely on a cadre of teen-age
scouts and an immensely popular site on America Online to keep them
current, although they frequently have to guess which movies and
stars are going to be popular three months ahead, because of
production deadlines. Most of their choices have been fairly safe,
although the cover of Puff Daddy, the rap star, was unusual in an
industry that rarely showcases black males.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it didn't require genius to put Leonardo DiCaprio on
the cover of the May issue, which sold out in 10 days and went back
for an additional printing of 400,000 copies. But Ms. Ferrari knows
she can't rely forever on a one-person windfall for the teen-age
magazine industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leonardo was huge and wonderful for us, as he was for a lot of
other magazines,'' she said. ``Everybody's getting a piece of him.
But we can't go back to the Leonardo well too many times.''
Especially once the 16-year-olds move on.

TRY THESE SAGE USES FOR PARSELY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Flat-leaf parsley is a biennial, growing 12 inches or taller. It
is more flavorful than the curly-leaf variety.
</P>
<P>
   Growing conditions: Grow from seed planted in fall or early
spring; it prefers cool weather. Feed occasionally with fish
emulsion or manure, and mulch with compost, especially in winter
and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Companion plants: Tomatoes, roses.
</P>
<P>
   Food pairings: Meat, poultry, sauces, rice, pasta, dips and
salad dressings made with cream cheese or mayonnaise; blends well
with other spices.
</P>
<P>
   Caveats: Treat parsley worms with ``bacillus thuringiensis,''
spider mites and aphids with insecticidal soap.
</P>
<P>
   ARTICHOKE AND BASIL RAGOUT
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6
</P>
<P>
   2 cups dry white wine, such as a white Rhone, riesling or chenin
blanc
</P>
<P>
   1 cup loosely packed fresh flat-leaf parsley, destemmed
</P>
<P>
   8 plump, fresh garlic cloves, peeled and halved
</P>
<P>
   Sea salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 firm, ripe tomatoes, cored, peeled and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 artichokes OR 8 baby artichokes OR two 9-ounce packages frozen
artichoke hearts, thawed, sliced, see Note
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, destemmed and julienned
</P>
<P>
   In a 3-quart saucepan, bring wine to a boil over high heat. Boil
vigorously until all the alcohol has burned off and there is no
alcohol aroma, about 8 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With a large chef's knife, finely chop parsley, garlic and salt.
Transfer to a heavy-duty saucepan. Add tomatoes, oil and wine.
Thoroughly drain artichoke slices and add to saucepan. Cover and
bring just to a simmer over moderate heat. Turn heat to low, cover
and simmer very gently for 30 to 45 minutes for fresh artichokes or
10 to 15 minutes for thawed, frozen artichokes, until they offer no
resistance when pierced with a knife. The ragout should not be dry
but should be bathed in a fragrant sauce. Stir in basil. Taste for
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   To serve as a first course or vegetable side dish, transfer to
warmed shallow soup bowls, spooning sauce over artichokes. Serve
with crusty bread for sopping.
</P>
<P>
   To serve with pasta, toss artichokes with 8 ounces cooked fresh
linguine, using all the liquid as the sauce. The pasta does not
require cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Note: To prepare artichokes, halve a lemon and squeeze juice
into a large bowl of cold water. Add lemon halves to water. With
your hands, break off artichoke stem from base. Bend back tough
outer green leaves, one at a time, and snap them off at base.
Continue snapping off leaves until only central cone of yellow
leaves with pale green tips remain. Lightly trim top cone of leaves
to just below green tips. Trim any dark green areas from base.
Slice artichokes lengthwise, making it easier to remove the choke.
Halve the artichoke lengthwise. With a small spoon or melon baller,
scrape out hairy choke from each half and discard. Cut each
artichoke half into eight even slices. Return each slice to lemon
water. Repeat for remaining artichokes.

JAPANESE FLOCK TO OUTLET CENTER IN HUDSON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Calif., Hawaii)  (lb) 
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTRAL VALLEY, N.Y. _ Machiko Takenaka, 25, a self-described
``office lady'' from Tokyo, was on a whirlwind tour of New York
City. The day before, she had seen ``Cats.'' She was bound for a
Mets game in the afternoon. But on this lovely spring morning, she
had carved out time for that supreme Japanese-tourist pastime:
shopping. Gucci, Max Mara and Anne Klein were just a few of the
stores on her itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than hit Madison Avenue, however, she had boarded a bus
at the Port Authority terminal, rolling north through the
reed-cloaked marshlands of New Jersey, past car dealerships and
tanning salons and into the foothills of the Catskill Mountains.
There, a kind of retail heaven awaited her, a seemingly incongruous
crossroads where luxury and bargain shopping meet.
</P>
<P>
   Many New Yorkers are unaware of Woodbury Common, a 220-store
complex an hour north of New York City where designers like
Versace, Christian Dior and Prada (masquerading under the name
Space) have quietly opened discount outlet stores in recent years.
But to the Japanese tourist, the outlet center _ a kind of
prefabricated New England village plunked down in the middle of
nowhere _ is hallowed ground, a must-do destination for even the
most abbreviated trip to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become famous in Japan,'' said Ms. Takenaka in halting
English, her shoulder supporting a Prada bag that held the $300 she
had budgeted for the day's shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   The yen has fallen against the dollar to its lowest level in
years, and the economic crisis in Asia has led to a modest decline
in Japanese tourism. But because of regulatory controls and an
unwieldy distribution system in Japan, most consumer goods in the
United States are still far cheaper for the Japanese than those in
their own country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese love to shop,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of
Barnard's Retail Trend Report, a company in Upper Montclair, N.J.,
that tracks national consumer-spending patterns. ``They're very
label-conscious and they want bargains. So when they come here,
they see the prices and say, `Oh my God, this is one-half the price
it is over there,' despite the fact that the yen has lost so much
of its value.''
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue is certainly more convenient than Woodbury Common
for foreign tourists in New York City. But not wanting to compete
with themselves, high-end designers prefer to place outlet stores,
which sell excess inventory from previous seasons, a good distance
from their bread and butter: full-price, in-season merchandise. For
the status-seeking, bargain-conscious consumer, the trip to Central
Valley is a small sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Six major Japanese tour operators include a trip to the outlet
center, either as part of their standard package or as an option.
One operator, Ano Hallo Tours in New York, reported that a trek to
Woodbury Common was the most popular daytime activity for the
16,000 Japanese tourists the company brings to New York each year,
beating visits to the Statue of Liberty and the Metropolitan Museum
of Art.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Chelsea GCA Realty, the company that owns and operates
Woodbury Common Premium Outlets _ as it is officially called _
along with 20 similar centers across the country, sat back and
marveled at the trend. Buy lately Chelsea, with headquarters in
Roseland, N.J., has begun to court the Japanese shopper.
</P>
<P>
   The company now holds workshops every few months for employees
at the outlet center, providing tips on how best to serve Japanese
customers. Salesclerks are told that it is wrong to approach the
customer aggressively. They are encouraged to place change on a
tray, following Japanese custom, rather than in the shopper's hand.
</P>
<P>
   The outlet center opened in 1985, and by 1995 had become a
Japanese tourist attraction, a phenomenon not limited to
metropolitan New York. The realty company said its outlet centers
in Cabazon, Calif., outside Palm Springs, and in Waipahu, Hawaii,
also see throngs of Japanese shoppers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (What the unwary shopper may not realize is that some of the
stores at Woodbury Common also sell clothing lines that they have
created only for the outlet store, clothes made of cheaper fabrics,
for instance.)
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Chelsea GCA started to advertise in the
half-dozen Japanese women's magazines that appeal to so-called
office ladies: young women who are hired by Japanese companies to
perform low-level clerical work and serve tea. Such women are not
only savvy about the latest fashions but also have disposable
income, because they tend to live rent-free with their parents
until they marry.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea has also hired someone fluent in Japanese to help staff
the information booth at the outlet center. Size-conversion charts,
a list of stores that carry clothes in sizes 2 and 4, which many
Japanese women wear, and maps of the complex are all available in
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Some designer labels are more popular than others among young
Japanese women, and Gucci, the high-end Italian designer, seems to
occupy the summit. Gucci officials say 60 percent of the outlet
store's business comes from Japanese shoppers. ``When they get off
the bus, they run, literally run, to the Gucci building,'' said
Michele Rothstein, Chelsea GCA's vice president for marketing, who
visits the center frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Max Mara, an Italian designer, is another big draw. ``I'd say 40
percent to 50 percent of our business is coming from the
Japanese,'' said Rose Liss, the store manager.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the Tahari outlet store said she once received a
call from a woman who wanted directions to Woodbury Common from the
airport. ``She had a chauffeur, and they were coming straight
here,'' the manager, Ro Joyce, recalled. ``I mean, she wasn't even
stopping at her hotel first.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the most recent year for which statistics are
available, Japanese visitors to New York City spent more per day,
$279, than visitors of any other nationality, according to a
federal survey of airline passengers.
</P>
<P>
   At times there seems to be a frantic quality to the buying at
Woodbury Common. Some shoppers first stop off at the Samsonite Co.
store in anticipation of the day's haul. Or they come in at the
end, laden with shopping bags like ornaments on a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this every day there is a tourist bus,'' said Carolynn
Morrissey, acting assistant manager of the Samsonite store. ``They
unload their bags into their new suitcases and we get stuck with
the garbage.''

U.S. INTERVENES IN CURRENCY MARKETS TO SUPPORT THE YEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for thorough rewrite of first half of article; re-edited;
adds two grafs at end)  (See also JAPAN-ECON, JAPAN-MARKETPLACE, JAPAN-ECONSCENE) 
(ps) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States took global financial markets by
surprise Wednesday, joining Japan in buying yen to stop the
precipitous fall of the Japanese currency. President Clinton said
he hoped the move would stem the worsening Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries spent an estimated $4 billion worth of dollars
in a coordinated purchase of yen in the foreign-exchange markets,
pushing up the yen more than 5 percent within hours. The stock
markets reacted exuberantly, and the Dow Jones industrial average
surged 164.17 points, or nearly 2 percent, erasing most of its
steep losses earlier in the week on apprehensions about Japan's
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking briefly in the Rose Garden Wednesday morning, Clinton
said he approved the rare action to sell dollars and buy yen after
speaking by telephone with Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro
Hashimoto, near midnight on Tuesday. The president said Hashimoto
committed to specific economic changes that go beyond Japan's past
pledges.
</P>
<P>
   But a list of actions released by the Japanese Finance Ministry
hours later appear to restate and go only modestly beyond Japan's
past agreements to deregulate the economy, clean up a banking
system awash in $600 billion worth of bad debts, and change the tax
system to stimulate an economy suffering its worst downturn in the
postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a chance to turn that situation in Asia around
before it gets any worse,'' Clinton said Wednesday. ``America needs
a strong, growing, stable economy in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   The action was evidently motivated, as well, by public
statements from China, where Clinton begins a nine-day visit next
week, that it might be forced to devalue its own currency if the
yen continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
   At a White House meeting on Tuesday night, Clinton's top
economic and security aides warned that a Chinese devaluation could
touch off a far more fearsome phase of the Asian crisis, which
began nearly a year ago with sharp devaluations of some Southeast
Asian currencies.
</P>
<P>
   While the president defended the U.S. move, some members of his
Cabinet remained skeptical that Hashimoto would deliver on the
vague promises he made Wednesday. The decision to intervene at all
was hotly debated inside the Treasury and the Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin had tentatively decided
not to recommend any action on Tuesday evening, but changed his
mind only an hour before making a final recommendation to the
president. Rubin was ultimately swayed to act because of
last-minute Japanese offers for a few more specific commitments,
and indications that traders in the currency markets, who had
battered the yen to a series of eight-year lows in recent selloffs,
were beginning to buy yen again.
</P>
<P>
   That was a turnaround that Rubin, a former investment banker and
currency trader, believed he could exploit and accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   But the real motivation was a growing sense in Washington and in
capitals around Asia that the continued fall of the yen could
richochet to markets around the world, further destabilizing
Russia, China and Latin America _ and perhaps then even the United
States. ``The chances were remote,'' Rubin said Wednesday, speaking
with his customary caution. But he said that if a major crisis were
to develop, ``the effects in our own nation could be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders said the intervention, conducted by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, appeared to be on the order of $1.5
billion to $2 billion of dollar sales for yen, with a simultaneous
move of similar magnitude by the Bank of Japan, the central bank
there.
</P>
<P>
   That is far less than the $20 billion Japan spent in April, with
little effect, to support its own currency.
</P>
<P>
   But the psychological effect of the American action Wednesday _
and the suggestion that more is on the way _ was immediate, if
perhaps temporary. The Japanese currency, which touched 146 to the
dollar earlier this week, fell back to about 137, a 5.2 percent
drop that returned it to the levels of a month ago. The Dow Jones
average, which had suffered a series of setbacks over the lpast few
weeks as fears increased that the Asian crisis is entering a new
phase, soared. Other stock indexes also increased.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is far from clear that the joint effort by the Federal
Reserve and Japanese would offer more than a respite from what an
senior administration official called ``a massive crisis of
confidence among investors in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lipsky, chief economist at Chase Manhattan Bank, said,
``The timing and the context suggest a finger in the dike'' _ a
view echoed by many traders, who doubted that the yen's bounce back
could last in the absence of a major change of course by Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin had told Congress last week that currency interventions
were of limited use unless investors are ``convinced by the
economic fundamentals.'' That means a series of unpopular steps to
clean up the Japanese economy _ bank closings, corporate
downsizing, big deficit spending by the government _ that few
Japanese politicians want to even discuss in public before an
election for the upper house of Parliament in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin insisted at the White House briefing Wednesday that he was
not backing away from the Clinton administration's strong-dollar
policy, arguing that it had ``served our interests very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Currency traders appeared to take that assertion at face value,
though Wednesday's action suggested that the United States viewed
the dollar's value as nearing its upper limits.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the currency intervention began, the administration
sent Rubin's deputy, Lawrence Summers, and William McDonough,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to Tokyo for
consulations with their Japanese counterparts. Underscoring the
sense that the Asian crisis was fast worsening, the Group of Seven
industrial nations announced that they would hold a meeting of
deputy finance ministers Saturday in Tokyo.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The politics of Clinton's trip to China also weighed heavily on
Wednesday's decision. Over the weekend, China accused the United
States and Japan of worsening the Asia crisis by letting the yen
fall, and in a series of messages to Treasury officials in the last
few days, they began hinting that pressure was growing to devalue
China's currency, the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   American officials have long feared that such a move would set
off devaluations around the world, as China's competitors
throughout Asia _ and in Latin America and Eastern Europe _
followed suit so that their own products would not be more
expensive than China's on world markets. That, in turn, could set
off the kind of market selloffs, unemployment and social unrest
that has built in Asia since last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this proves is that the depths of the Asian crisis are
much, much worse than anticipated,'' C. Fred Bergsten, president of
the Institute for International Economics here, said Wednesday.
``What spurred this is that many in Asia are talking about their
version of our Great Depression.'' Officials of the World Bank have
also begun to use the word ``depression,'' and they told reporters
Wednesday that they now expect the Asian economic crisis to last
for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't expect much over the short term,'' said Jonathan
Fiechter, director of the World Bank's financial sector development
department, who has been working on restructuring the crippled
financial systems of South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. ``It's
going to be a long, drawn-out process. The risk is a loss of
political support as this drags on. As people lose their jobs, the
consensus for painful change diminishes. ''
</P>
<P>
   Japan, however, has added to the problems immeasurably. Its
economy accounts for 70 percent of all economic activity in Asia.
So its deep recession _ the economy shrank at an annual rate of 5.3
percent in the first quarter of this year _ has added to the
region's pain in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not buying goods produced in Southeast Asia. The flight
of investors from Japan, including many Japanese who are now free
to put their money into other currencies because of liberalized
financial rules, has added to the problem _ sending the yen
spiraling downward by 15 percent in recent months. That makes
Japanese goods less expensive in the United States and other
countries _ pushing out goods produced by other Asians.
</P>
<P>
   As the yen dropped day after day, investors began to flee the
currencies of other countries, from Russia to Indonesia, setting
off new fear in those markets.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Indonesian rupiah, which many expected to
recover after the resignation of President Suharto, has sunk to new
lows _ 15,250 to the dollar. Before the Asian economic crisis, it
took about 2,400 rupiah to buy a dollar. As a result, Indonesian
banks and businesses that borrowed abroad _ often from Japanese
banks _ have stopped paying their debts. That, in turn, worsens the
problems in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin has been saying for weeks that Japan is the biggest threat
to Asia's recovery. But he had resisted calls to intervene in the
markets, declaring that ``ultimately, currency markets follow
fundamentals.'' In this case, the fundamentals meant a
restructuring of a Japanese economy from top to bottom: closing the
weak banks, dropping tax rates to spur consumer spending, and
ending decades of regulations that were intended to discourage new
competitiors, both foreign and domestic, that could disrupt the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
   By intervening Wednesday, Rubin is attempting to cheer the
Japanese on, giving them aid in bringing back their currency and
hoping that the declaration of commitment to further changes will
inch Japanese politicians in the direction of reform. But it is a
risky bet. If the markets determine soon that the changes are not
genuine, currency traders may soon renew their selloff of the yen.
That will force Rubin to decide whether to throw more money into
the pot, in hopes of instilling fear in traders that they might get
caught with too many dollars and too few yen.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue likely to dominate Rubin's travels through Asia
next week, which begin in China with the president, and then move
on to Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea.

YELTSIN APPOINTS EX-AIDE TO NEGOTIATE FUND LOAN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin of Russia appointed Anatoly
Chubais on Wednesday as his special representative to negotiate
with the International Monetary Fund, which is sending a team to
Russia on Monday to discuss the possibility of a new
multibillion-dollar loan to help stabilize the country's financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, a former first deputy prime minister who currently
heads Russia's electrical power monopoly, has great credibility in
Western financial circles because of his reputation as a
free-market advocate and because he is regarded as an able manager
and administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chubais was dismissed from his government post in March
along with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, he was sent recently
to Washington by Yeltsin to meet with United States Treasury
officials and the monetary fund to explore the possibility of
further loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether his appointment, which was announced
Wednesday by the Kremlin, would mean that he would once again have
ministerial rank in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment came as Russia canceled the sale of 182-day
Treasury bills at the first of three auctions planned Wednesday
because investors demanded too high a yield, a Finance Ministry
official said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cancellation suggested that investors still remain skeptical
about the stability of the Russian economy and are demanding high
interest rates. But it also shows that the government might be able
to line up cheaper sources of financing, either from government
bonds or from loans from the monetary fund.

MEN CATCHING WAVE OF CASUAL ISLAND LOOK: ALOHA SHIRTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE M. SPITZA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Real men wear floral _ and look darned good doing so.
</P>
<P>
   They have for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis was king, and he wore an Aloha shirt in the 1963 movie
``Blue Hawaii.'' Frank Sinatra sported one in ``From Here to
Eternity,'' set in 1941. During their terms in office, Presidents
Truman and Eisenhower were known for their off-time tropical
shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people today are drawn to Aloha shirts because they
suggest another time,'' said Janet Giese, buyer for the Hawaiian
Shop in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young guys like them. Older guys like them. Business guys like
them. They reflect an attitude. The guys who wear them seem pretty
sure of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   And macho _ you bet. Vibrant island prints can be very manly.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Jungle Bird'' Hawaiian shirt that hunk actor Tom Selleck
made popular in the television series ``Magnum P.I.'' is an icon of
Americana. It hangs in the Smithsonian Institution, for heaven's
sake.
</P>
<P>
   (If more timely examples are necessary, catch the upcoming
floral-shirted performance of actor Nicolas Cage. He plays a buff
police detective in the flick ``Snake Eyes,'' scheduled for release
later this summer.)
</P>
<P>
   Whether you love 'em or hate 'em, flashy floral Aloha shirts _
and the more contemporary ``motif'' sports shirts _ are back in
fashion for the male of the species this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The look is not isolated to one particular customer,'' said
John Coumbe, owner of John's &AMP; Co., a high-end Phoenix men's shop.
``Ralph Lauren's doing it. Armani's doing it. Everybody's got a
piece of it in their summer line. It's considered to be in good
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, designs with obnoxious touristy prints _ such as those
grounded in Pepto-Bismol pink and sewn of polyester _ are not the
prevailing trend. The eclectic Aloha garb presented in the new
summer movie ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' is a good example
of what not to wear. (That terry-cloth Aloha shirt worn by actor
Johnny Depp as journalist Raoul Duke is just plain ol' tacky.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys love those wild and flashy prints, and they wear
them all the time,'' Giese said. ``They've been wearing those for
years. But there's also this trend toward classy, tasteful shirts
that have some panache to them _ some pizazz.
</P>
<P>
   It's true. This summer's crop of casual island-inspired fashion
shirts tend toward ``artful sophistication'' and ``retro chic.''
Rayon, Egyptian cotton and textured silk are the fabrics of choice.
Some of the season's best designs are reproductions of patterns
dating to the 1940s _ when Hawaiian shirts were considered
sophisticated sportswear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like neckwear right now,'' Coumbe said. ``There's
no set direction (for Aloha shirts). It's something that just
appeals to you.''
</P>
<P>
   What appeals to today's fashionable gentlemen, Coumbe said, are
patterns that are not too wild. He described the look as ``easy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so flashy. It's low-key,'' he said. ``It could be
orange _ as long as the pattern is simple and not overpowering.''
</P>
<P>
   If worn appropriately, a vibrant island-scene shirt exudes an
aura of confidence. A hibiscus print hanging from broad shoulders
reflects a relaxed approach to life. For that matter, a palm tree
and pineapple print conveys an overall casual outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: These shirts are fun to wear. They are pleasing
to the eye. And they can be great conversation pieces at a poolside
party. &QL;

MANY GM STRIKERS SAY FLINT WILL BE MUST-WIN BATTLE FOR LABOR

   FLINT, Mich. _ It's been called the battle of Flint, and many of
the combatants believe that they are waging a last-ditch fight for
the American way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking back America,'' autoworker Kim McKinnis said
Wednesday as he walked the picket line outside one of two
strike-idled General Motors plants. ``It's got to start
somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the twin Flint strikes continued to ripple across
the country Wednesday, as the GM assembly plant in Arlington,
Texas, joined the victims of the labor strife. More than 77,400
workers at 19 GM plants have been sent home because of a shortage
of crucial parts for cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The 9,200 striking Flint workers who set off the chain reaction
seemed as determined as ever Wednesday to hold out against the
company. Hundreds of striking workers and their supporters held
boisterous rallies in front of the closed plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our stand for the working people across the country,''
Duane Zuckschwerdt, president of United Auto Workers Local 659,
told cheering strikers. ``It's probably going to be a long one.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators said they have made almost no progress in resolving
the issues that prompted a June 5 walkout at a metal fabricating
plant, followed by a June 11 strike at another GM facility that
makes oil filters, odometers and other parts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the talks will include production rates, plant safety
and other traditional labor-management disputes, both sides agree
that the standoff is really a fight over what GM calls its efforts
to compete in the global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it needs union concessions to keep up with its
rivals at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The union wants assurances that GM will stem the flow of jobs to
outside suppliers and foreign factories.
</P>
<P>
   Each side accuses the other of broken promises and bad faith.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of the dispute go back to 1995, when GM and the UAW
agreed to work together in boosting productivity at the metal
plant, where workers stamp out hoods, fenders and engine cradles
for several GM brands.
</P>
<P>
   In return for the union's pledge to consolidate jobs and
increase productivity, GM promised a $300 million plant upgrade.
The company shelved the investment plan after spending about $120
million, accusing union leaders of not living up to their end of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't continue to invest in a plant with noncompetitive
practices,'' GM spokesman Gerry Holmes said. ``We have to be more
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said union officials have not worked with the company to
eliminate a practice that lets some workers quit for the day when
they meet their production quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Doris Conway, a welder on the engine cradle line, said she often
spends her final hour or so at work watching CNN in the cafeteria,
working out in the gym or relaxing after she meets her quota of 665
parts in an eight-hour shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get your production, there's no more to do,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Conway, who earns more than $20 an hour, said she views her free
time as a payoff for meeting her daily target ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welding is one of the most undesirable jobs in the plant. It's
dirty. It's hot. You get war marks on you like this,'' she said,
rolling up her sleeve to display ugly burn scars.
</P>
<P>
   But some plant workers who don't work under the quota system say
they would be happy to jettison the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be ludicrous for us to bring that to the (bargaining)
table,'' said Frank Trubiro, a 15-year plant veteran. ``What
company in the world would agree to that?''
</P>
<P>
   Trubiro and other striking workers say they are far more worried
about keeping their jobs. GM has cut its work force by half in the
past two decades, as the company's share of the domestic auto
market slipped from nearly 50 percent to less than a third today.
</P>
<P>
   Flint, birthplace of GM and the UAW, has been particularly hard
hit, surrendering nearly 44,000 jobs since 1978. Worker resentment
escalated over the Memorial Day weekend when company officials
secretly removed machinery devoted to parts for a new full-size
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials, who have agreed to return the machinery after a
settlement, said they wanted to avoid disrupting the new truck line
in the event of a strike. Workers viewed the removal as another
betrayal and a signal that GM is ready to abandon the Flint
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Motors would love to pull out, not just out of Flint,
but out of the United States,'' striker Dave Schneider said as
Bruce Springsteen's ``Born in the U.S.A.'' blared out of a
picket-line loudspeaker. ``They've got our backs against the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Some striking workers concede that their strategy might backfire
by putting GM further behind its rivals. Industry analysts estimate
that the company will lose as much as $500 million a week during
the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Trubiro said he figures he has nothing to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't be happy until all the manufacturing is basically
moved right out of this country,'' he said. ``I would rather go
down swinging and not make it easy for them than just lay down and
let them steamroll us.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday jettisoned broad
legislation meant to discourage teen-agers from smoking, the most
ambitious and contentious measure before Congress, and left almost
no hope it could be revived this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which had been debated on the Senate floor for a
month, was set aside when supporters, mostly Democrats, could not
get the 60 votes needed to clear two procedural hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats promised to bring the matter up again at every
opportunity this year, but they conceded that they had little
chance of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the final vote on this bill occurs on Election
Day,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Republican opponents of the bill, which would have raised the
price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack, argued that it was not
primarily an anti-smoking measure but a tax increase to pay for
government programs. ``This is a massive tax on low-income
Americans, and it is used to proliferate the bureaucracy of this
government,'' declared Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain, the maverick Republican from Arizona who
was the bill's chief sponsor, emphasized the importance of stopping
teen-agers from getting hooked on smoking. ``This bill is not about
taxes,'' he told the Senate just before the votes. ``It's about
whether we're going to allow the death march of 418,000 Americans a
year who die early from tobacco-related disease and do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who favors strong anti-smoking legislation,
criticized the Senate, blamed the tobacco companies and their
advertising campaign for the bill's defeat and made it clear that
he would use the issue for partisan purposes in the fall's
congressional campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been working for three years now to protect our
children from the dangers of tobacco,'' Clinton said in an
impromptu appearance in the White House briefing room on Wednesday
evening. ``I want the tobacco lobby and its allies on Capitol Hill
to know that from my point of view, the battle is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott, the Republican leader, said The Senate was so
divided on the issue that it was impossible to produce a bill that
would command the 60 votes needed in the Senate to pass contentious
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   On the crucial vote, 57 senators voted to cut off debate and
move to a final vote, a procedure called cloture. But that was
three votes shy of 60 votes necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-three Democrats and 14 Republicans voted in favor of
cloture. Forty Republicans and two Democrats from tobacco states,
Wendell Ford of Kentucky and Charles Robb of Virginia, voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Senate dealt the final blow by voting to send the bill
back to the Commerce Committee. It would have required 60 votes to
prevent this, and the supporters fell seven votes short.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have been
waiting to see what happened in the Senate before they acted on a
tobacco bill. They are opposed to ambitious legislation like the
Senate bill. The word in the House on Wednesday night was that the
leaders might still try to pass some low-budget alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Wednesday night, House Speaker Newt Gingrich
said: ``It is our intent to take up and pass effective legislation
that is narrowly focused on anti-teen smoking, anti-drug efforts.
Our goal is to reduce teen smoking, not increase taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising the price of cigarettes over the next
five years, the Senate measure would have given the government new
authority to regulate tobacco advertising and marketing and imposed
stiff penalties on cigarette makers if the rate of teen-age smoking
did not fall to specified levels.
</P>
<P>
   But amendments added in the Senate in the last few weeks would
have given a tax break to married couples and established new
programs against drug abuse. These measures will die with the
overall bill, though they might be added to other legislation
before the year is out.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was prompted to take up the tobacco issue by the
settlement signed a year ago this Saturday by the major tobacco
companies and the attorneys general from 40 states. Under the
agreement, the industry would have paid $368.5 billion over the
next 25 years and agreed to restraints on tobacco advertising. In
return, they would have been given immunity from most lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The settlement required congressional action before it could go
into effect. Without a federal law, the states are expected to
press their multibillion-dollar legal claims against the tobacco
companies. Individuals may also be more likely to go to court now,
especially in light of the decision by a jury in Florida last week
to find the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. liable for a smoker's
death.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill came out of McCain's committee in April on a
19-to-1 bipartisan vote, its prospects for approval seemed good.
But the tobacco companies rebelled when they realized that the
Senate was not going to protect them from lawsuits, and began a
national advertising campaign against the bill said to cost tens of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's supporters said that the ads turned the tide, much as
ads by insurance companies were held responsible for defeating
President Clinton's health-care plan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco companies have made a very wise investment, and
they have won,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Duchesne, a spokesman retained by the tobacco industry,
said that the Senate action on Wednesday was ``evidence the public
came to understand what was in the bill.'' Higher taxes, he said,
would not have solved the youth smoking problem.
</P>
<P>
   From the other side, C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon
general, said: ``I hope that the senators who derailed this bill
today lose sleep every night listening to the sound of children
taking their first puff and the sound of emphysema and cancer
patients gasping for their last breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Koop, who served under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush,
added, ``I hope it keeps the Republican leadership awake, too.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCain, knowing he was facing defeat and clearly deflated by the
experience, gave a speech unusually critical of his own party. He
noted that some of his colleagues had said that the action on the
tobacco legislation would define the Republican Party, and he
continued:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Mr. President, there may be something to that.
Because maybe we ought to remember the obligations that we incur
when we govern America. Maybe we ought to remember the principles
of the founder of our party. We might want to understand that our
obligation first of all is to those who can't care for themselves
in this society, and that includes our children. Shouldn't it
define the Republican Party that we should do everything we can to
handle this scourge, this disease that is rampant throughout young
children in America? Doesn't that define the Republican Party?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain then put down his microphone and walked off the Senate
floor. Across the aisle, in an extremely unusual gesture,
Democratic senators stood and applauded. Republicans remained
silent in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's votes came after a day of huddles by leaders from
both parties to count votes. Republicans said that Lott had made
clear that he would allow no votes until he was sure his side would
win.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats left no doubt that they would use the issue in the
congressional election campaigns this fall and portray Republicans
as tools of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The question before the Senate, said Sen. Kent Conrad of North
Dakota, was ``Do we protect our children's lives or do we protect
the profits of the tobacco industry?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader,
declared: ``This bill may be dead. But tobacco legislation is not
dead. We will not let this issue die. We will come back. We will
keep at it.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Republicans seemed unfazed by such arguments, confident
that the public was more concerned about a tax increase than about
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill breaks the budget,'' said Sen. Don Nickles of
Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader.

TESTIMONY CONCLUDES IN BRAWLEY DEFAMATION SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CLAUDIA ROWE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ After seven months, more than two dozen
witnesses and the last-minute appearance of a television celebrity,
testimony concluded Wednesday in the Tawana Brawley defamation
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The case has been marked by outrageous antics and, in keeping
with its history, it ended with a threat of further dramatics. But
breaking with history, the judge put a stop to that.
</P>
<P>
   Justice S. Barrett Hickman of State Supreme Court left the
courtroom Wednesday afternoon with a box of papers in his arms,
prepared to work on the complicated charge to the jury. Closing
arguments are expected to begin some time next week and the jury
could begin deliberations before the end of month.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is very happy to have reached this point,'' said
Hickman. ``There may have been some doubts as to whether we would
or not.'' The judge has endured bruising attacks from all four
lawyers involved in the case, and criticism from outside observers
about the the length of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox Jr., are
being sued by Steven Pagones because they publicly accused him of
participating in the abduction and rape of Miss Brawley in 1987. A
grand jury that investigated the allegations in 1988 determined
there was no evidence that Miss Brawley had ever been assaulted,
and specifically exonerated Pagones. He has charged that the
defendants acted recklessly and maliciously and is now seeking
about $400 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hardy, the lawyer representing Sharpton, attempted to
wrap up his case by asking Geraldo Rivera, the television
personality, to testify about the ``crucial issue'' of Sharpton's
character. Rivera, arriving at the Dutchess County Courthouse an
hour late, said he had known Sharpton for 15 years and was prepared
to testify that his character was excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe that Al Sharpton is capable of malice,''
Rivera said outside the courthouse. ``I believe history will
ultimately recognize Rev. Sharpton as one of the great civil rights
leaders in America.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rivera had taken the stand, Stanton said he was prepared to
call any number of witnesses to rebut whatever Rivera might have
said. This could have pushed testimony into the trial's fourth
season.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hickman has frequently been criticized for losing
control of the proceedings, he had previously ruled that Rivera
would not be allowed to testify. Wednesday, he held firm. In
stopping Rivera's testimony, the judge said the issue of character
was at most only ``remotely relevant,'' and that it would cloud
other more important issues, unnecessarily prolonging the trial.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Hardy rested his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``All right, fine,'' said the judge. ``That's cause for some
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   There were no cheers, however, and observers exited quietly, as
they would on any other day. Sharpton, who was making a rare
appearance in court, embraced Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   But some people were smiling: the jurors. One court officer said
that the jurors were so happy they were almost singing as they left
the building. And he hazarded a guess as to why: ``They won't have
to listen to witnesses drone on, although I have a feeling their
ears will be bleeding by the time summations are over.''
</P>
<P>
   For some of the jurors, the trial that began last Nov. 18, has
had bitter consequences. One juror had to draw heavily on her
savings to support herself while sitting on the lengthy trial.
Another, an alternate, was hit by a car and critically injured as
she returned to court from a lunch break. Both women were
eventually excused. Now six jurors and two alternates remain.
</P>
<P>
   Even though it marked the end of testimony at the trial, there
were those who were disappointed by the decision that prevented
Rivera from taking the stand. Sharpton said later: ``I can be
called a buffoon, but a guy comes in to testify that I have an
excellent character, and he's not allowed to. We call this
justice?''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Maddox said he would not appeal the jury's
decision, whatever it might be.``I don't think there's a court in
this land that will give Maddox, Mason and Sharpton justice,'' he
said. ``It would be an exercise in futility to take this case any
further.''
</P>
<P>
   Pagones needed to prove that Sharpton and the other defendants
disregarded facts and willfully avoided learning the truth when
they accused him of attacking Miss Brawley. To do so, Pagones'
lawyer, William Stanton, called 24 witnesses to the stand _
including hospital nurses who said there had never been any
evidence of rape, and a neighbor who said she had seen the
15-year-old Miss Brawley crawl into the garbage bag in which she
was later discovered, covered in excrement and racial epithets.
</P>
<P>
   Maddox, who is representing himself, called four witnesses and
sought to show that Pagones had been protected from justice by a
corrupt legal establishment. Stephen Jackson, representing Mason,
called only one witness. Hardy asked his client, Sharpton, and
Pagones to return briefly to the stand to clarify several points.
In total, there were 29 trial witnesses and 303 exhibits and
supporting documents.
</P>
<P>
   Though Pagones said he was relieved to be done with this portion
of the case, he couldn't resist a final jab at the defense:
``Mason, Maddox and Sharpton tried to call everybody except for the
relevant people _ Tawana, Glenda Brawley and Ralph King,'' he said,
referring to Miss Brawley, her mother and stepfather. ``You didn't
hear from any of them and you've got to ask why.''

STOCKS SOAR AFTER U.S. AND JAPAN AID YEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Subs for new 7th graf with update on Japanese stock market
activity)  (dc) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market staged a powerful rally Wednesday
after the United States and Japan bought yen to bolster the sagging
currency, whose fall has threatened to plunge Asia into a deeper
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Worries that financial instability in Japan and Southeast Asia
would result in a global slowdown this year that would cut even
deeper into the already slumping profits of American companies had
punished share prices for the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But investors stampeded back into the market after the U.S.
government and the Bank of Japan moved to bolster the value of the
Japanese yen, partly in the hope of preventing a deeper economic
and currency crisis in Japan and the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   After plunging more than 207 points, or 2.3 percent, Monday on
fears of a widening crisis in Asia, enthusiastic buying sent the
Dow Jones industrial average soaring 164.17 points, or 1.89
percent, to close at 8,829.46.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of companies that had been battered by a huge wave of
selloffs recently roared back to life in one of the heaviest
trading days of the year with more than 744 million shares changing
hands. While a wide majority of stocks gained, technology and
blue-chip issues led the recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market had been going down because of Japan _ Japan was
the new wrinkle in Southeast Asia,'' said Byron Wien, the U.S.
investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. ``But now it
looks like there's intervention and that Japan's going to deal with
its problems, and that is a clear positive for the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's big rally brought an early Thursday rally in
Japan. At the midday break, the Nikkei index of 225 issues was up
4.4 percent, or 647.11 points, to 15,362.49.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government's decision to buy Japanese yen with
dollars, coupled with promises that Japanese officials would
address the deepening banking crisis there, helped lift the value
of the Japanese currency, which had fallen close to an eight-year
low on Monday at 146.15 yen to the dollar. Wednesday, the value of
the yen reached 136.37.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices, however, plummeted after rising sharply in the last
week on the prospect that Asia's economic slowdown would benefit
bondholders by dragging down commodity prices and helping stave off
inflationary pressure. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury,
which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.73
Wednesday from 5.65 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, though, Wednesday's events were not a clear
indication that corporate profits, which are expected to be hurt in
the coming year by a strong dollar and falling demand in Asia, are
no longer in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asia problem is clearly not going to go away easily,''
said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.
``Investors would like to believe it's going to go away, but it's
already clearly had an impact on earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in the last few weeks several large multinational
companies, including IBM, 3M and Motorola, have warned that the
Asian economic crisis would depress earnings growth this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economy continues to grow at a robust pace, with
few signs of inflation, slowing profit growth in the first quarter
of the year and worries that Asia's festering crisis would pinch
profits even more led to a sharp selloff beginning in mid-April,
after the Dow peaked at 9,211.84.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, investors helped ignite the Dow, which soared as
much as 230 points before a late wave of selling pushed the index
lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 19.52, or 1.79
percent, to 1,107.11, and the Nasdaq composite gained 1.33 percent,
to 1,776.40.
</P>
<P>
   Oil stocks gained after the price of oil soared on reports that
the leaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
would move to establish more oil production cuts. And, tobacco
stocks, which rose modestly Wednesday, may rise higher Thursday
because the Senate voted to reject a tobacco bill aimed at curbing
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   To prolong the rally, however, analysts say that Japanese
officials are going to have to do much more than commit to banking
reform and stimulus packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is potentially a watershed event for the financial
crisis,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, the chief investment strategist
at Lehman Brothers. ``However, the real economy in Japan is still
going down. But what was crucial for the markets was to see a
policy response. And that's what you're seeing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wien of Morgan Stanley added that a big selloff may yet come
later this year if things don't change, at home and in Asia. The
rally, he said, was simply an indication that things were looking
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rally on the promise Japan will do something,'' he
said. ``So we'll have to see what Japan does, and then assess
whether it's enough.'' &QL;

`THE JELL-O IS ALWAYS RED': SONGS SUIT LETTERS TO A T 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like a package of Necco wafers, the new revue ``The
Jell-O Is Always Red'' is generous but unexciting.
</P>
<P>
   This grab bag of some 30 lighthearted songs and sketches
rummages its way through the trunk of Clark Gesner, whose credits
include the book, music and lyrics of the popular ``You're a Good
Man, Charlie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Charles Schulz's comic strip, the three-person ``Jell-O''
show is amiable and eager to amuse. But it is more cute than
captivating, and by its end, some of what was initially enjoyable
has been repeated to the point of worn-out welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Take the tune ``You're the One I'm Four.'' It sounds as if it's
a love ditty, but the joke is that Gesner is singing it to large
onstage numerals. The idea is clever the first time, but when it
turns up again and again, as in ``By the Sea,'' with the letters C
and U and lines like ``Oh, how I'd love to be beside U,'' the fizz
is out of the champagne, and ``Sesame Street'' for grown-ups is
definitely in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In his songs and sketches, directed by James Morgan, Gesner is
joined by Neal Young and Celia Gentry, who displays sufficient
mischief in a variety of guises and accents to suggest that she
might be a lot more fun in different surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The show's material is not without wit. The title tune, about
the sameness of diner food, packs keen observation. In ``Everything
I Buy Was Made in China,'' Gesner sings ruefully about the
difficulty of finding American-made goods when everything is
imported. And the sketch that introduces Gesner as a huge,
blue-swaddled baby who thinks in Shakespearean language comes as a
welcome relief from lyrics whose rhymes tend to be of the ``noon''
and ``spoon'' variety.
</P>
<P>
   But some routines are frail, talky or predictable, like one
about a cost cutter who wants to charge for public use of the
letter R and another about an executive who is aped by everyone
after he accidentally leaves some peanut butter on his chin.
</P>
<P>
   A little of this ``Jell-O'' goes a long way.
</P>
<P>

Veterans fully aware that danger abounds
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ They are drawn like so many unsuspecting flies into
the spider's web, brought by a combination of their own confidence
and the come-hither look of the green lady.
</P>
<P>
   That is the danger of the U.S. Open, played on the most
beautifully trimmed courses with the finest of pedigrees. Except
that somewhere out there amid the perfectly mowed grass and the
stately trees and the shimmering water of the blue ponds is a
perilous, bottomless pit, waiting to swallow them up.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the great championships in other sports, the U.S. Open is
not a battle between a pair of great opponents. It has never really
been Nicklaus vs. Palmer or Hogan vs. Snead or Ernie Els vs. Colin
Montgomerie and Loren Roberts in a three-way playoff.
</P>
<P>
   A golf tournament, especially this golf tournament, usually
comes down to a duel with nature. It's the farmer battling the
drought. It's the old man and the sea. It's the scrappy pioneers
trying to make their way across the unforgiving prairies.
</P>
<P>
   If you take your average professional golfer out to the first
tee at the U.S. Open, his first reaction is not likely to be:
``Yikes! I've got to play against Tiger Woods or Justin Leonard.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's probably going to say is something along the lines of:
``Omigod! There's a dogleg to the right, and I have never been able
to fade the ball with consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   What scares these guys during Open week is never the other guys
in their threesome with their hot 3-woods or sizzling putters. It's
that water hazard over here and the bunker over there and the green
that slopes to the back and carries approach shots into the trouble
and the breeze that blows in off the nearby Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Regular folks look at a golf course and see the birds and the
trees and the water, a haven of natural serenity. The golfer looks
at the same piece of land and sees out of bounds on the left,
double bogeys and missed par putts, his own equivalent of metal
crunching from a multiple car wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the U.S. Open can be a pleasant stroll. Like walking
through the streets of the former Yugoslavia. Yes, it can be a
cruise. On a sinking ship with no lifeboats.
</P>
<P>
   Yet year after year, some of them come to the Open fully
convinced they are ready to tame the beast. It is the young ones,
mostly. The ones who look at the yardage cards and sniff at the
mere 6,797 yards offered up by the Olympic Club and wonder why so
many are cringing in fear.
</P>
<P>
   Woods came in from a practice round and declared that if the
winds stayed calm, it would likely take a score of 6 under par,
maybe lower, to win the Open. Els, the defending champion with the
the aching back, offered that it could be in the 4- to 5-under
range. See Leonard with the bounce in his step and Lee Westwood
with the confident smile. Even cart-riding Casey Martin is ready to
hit the accelerator and go.
</P>
<P>
   The kids are practically salivating over the prospect of taking
on a course that is significantly shorter than Congressional
Country Club, site of last year's Open, which measures 7,213 yards.
In one breath, they say all the right things about course
management and shot-making. Then in the next breath, they are
almost hyperventilating at getting a shot at the par-4, 288-yard
No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can hit with a driver on this course,'' Woods said. ``You
really can if you want to.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just it about the Open. What you want to do and what you
think you are capable of doing are often in direct contrast to what
these devilish Open courses will allow. A place like the Olympic
Club opens its gates and asks the guests in for a visit and then
treats them to a weekend of sheer torture.
</P>
<P>
   You can ask any of the veterans, the golfers who have lines on
their faces in part from the sun but mostly from frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, 48, is already on the record as saying that the
winner will finish over par, which would be the first time that has
happened since 1978 at Cherry Hills in Denver when Andy North shot
1-over for the championship. He points to the Olympic Club's demand
for accuracy and a rough that is tougher to get out of than a Ken
Starr investigation. ``Plus, we're due for some wind, and that's
going to make the greens very hard,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, the rough is longer than it was in 1987,'' said
Scott Simpson, who won the title that year, the last time it was
held at the Olympic Club. ``It's real long, and it's real tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson won that year by beating out Watson with four rounds
that were brilliantly consistent, if not consistently brilliant. He
hit the ball down the middle of the fairways, chipped close and
made a lot of pars and won at 3-under.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what you're supposed to do in any battle with Mother
Nature or the Open, just mind your manners and hope you get out
alive.

CLIPPERS, KARL HAVE HELD `INFORMAL' TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers have spoken twice with
George Karl but still appear in the early stages of talks with the
former Seattle SuperSonics coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been some informal bantering back and forth,''
said Bret Adams, who is Karl's agent. ``They have not spoken to me
directly, and I would handle the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl seems to be the Clippers' only serious candidate at the
moment because the Sonics hired Paul Westphal as their coach on
Wednesday. Westphal had talked to the Clippers and was considered
their No.2 choice behind Karl.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Clippers land Karl depends on several factors,
including the status of Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson. Karl
would immediately become a candidate for the Bulls job if, as
expected, Jackson is not brought back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody really knows for sure what's going to happen in
Chicago,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is how much influence Karl will have with the
Clippers regarding personnel decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I would want to have a lot of control,'' Karl told
the Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not it's with the Clippers, Karl seems ready to get
back into coaching by next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more excited to coach now than in the last five years.
There will be a new team I can get to put together. I'll have a
chance to do some teaching with new talent,'' Karl said.
``Hopefully, it will be a good challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Clippers want to pay Karl big money is another
issue. Karl said he is willing to take less to coach a winning
team; he is believed to be able to command at least $5 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all about money for him,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   There also remains the possibility that Karl would take a year
off from coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to coach next year, but he's not in a big hurry,''
Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clippers fail to hire Karl, top remaining candidates
include Lakers assistant coach Kurt Rambis and former San Antonio
Spurs coach Bob Hill. Rambis spoke to the Clippers in Chicago last
week during a predraft camp.

PROGRAMS FOR GIFTED FAVOR WHITES, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Black and Hispanic parents continue to be less likely
than white parents to be offered classroom tours and meetings with
educators about programs for gifted children, according to a report
released Wednesday by ACORN, an advocacy group based in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   For the survey, modeled after housing discrimination tests,
volunteers posed as parents and visited 26 schools during the last
two months. The report says that little has changed since a similar
survey was conducted two years ago. In that report, released in
April 1996, the group accused the school system of denying black
and Hispanic parents equal access to classes for the gifted by
failing to provide information.
</P>
<P>
   The group filed a complaint with the civil-rights arm of the
U.S. Department of Education. That and other complaints have
prompted a federal civil-rights investigation into the city's
programs for the gifted.
</P>
<P>
   Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew cited his own concerns last year
about the possible exclusion of minority and immigrant children. He
prohibited admission fees and testing fees, which at least two of
the city's 32 community school districts were charging.
</P>
<P>
   He also ordered school-district officials to post information
about their programs in each school and asked district
superintendents to explain in writing what kinds of admission
criteria they used and why they used them.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in a brief statement, Crew said the latest ACORN
study ``glosses over the substantial efforts'' he has undertaken in
recent years. ``Since becoming chancellor, I have continually
called for greater publicizing of these programs,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Crew's spokesman, J.D. LaRock, said Wednesday that most
districts have moved away from relying solely on IQ tests and are
looking at examples of students' work and at teacher referrals.
Crew also pointed to the Math/Science Institute, a coaching program
established last year to prepare more black and Hispanic students
for the city's most competitive high schools.
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement with the civil-rights office of the Department
of Education, the school board has promised to post information
about programs for the gifted at every school and district office.
</P>
<P>
   The ACORN report criticized the board for having failed to post
the information. But city and federal education officials
maintained Wednesday that the signs are not required to be posted
until this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives for ACORN, formally known as the Association of
Community Organizations for Reform Now, said Wednesday that they
planned to file another complaint with the federal agency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In their survey, the testers were instructed to try to talk to
teachers and principals about classes for the gifted at each school
and to request class tours.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 percent of the African-American and Hispanic testers
were able to talk with a teacher or another educator familiar with
the school's gifted programs, compared with 45 percent of the
non-Hispanic white testers, the report said. About 13 percent of
the black and Hispanic testers were allowed to look in on a class,
compared with 40 percent of the whites.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that middle schools in which most of the
students were black and Hispanic failed to provide advanced math
and science classes required for entrance to the city's competitive
high schools. Moreover, the report said that in some federally
financed programs that were intended to integrate schools with
large minority concentrations, white students were overrepresented
in the classes for the gifted.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, at Intermediate School 54 on the Upper West Side,
the report said, white students made up only 13 percent of the
student body but 40 percent of the gifted students, while black and
Hispanic children, more than 80 percent of the student body, made
up roughly 55 percent of the gifted students.

CLINTON NAMES RICHARDSON, HOLBROOKE TO POSTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH   AND DAVID MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton will name Bill Richardson,
the chief US envoy to the United Nations, as head of the US
Department of Energy today, according to administration officials.
He will be replaced by Richard Holbrooke, the brash diplomatic
trouble-shooter who gained prominence by negotiating an end to the
war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will announce the nominations Thursday at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement signals the departure of one of the
administration's most dashing foreign policy figures and the
arrival of a tough new personality in American foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, long seen as a potential candidate for secretary of
state, will finally get an opportunity to put his imprint on US
foreign policy at the dawn of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear whether Richardson's departure from the UN
was a reward or punishment for his performance. The former New
Mexico Democrat, who raced back to Washington from Rome where he
was addressing a war crimes conference, has openly voiced his
desire to pursue higher office in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Richardson have suggested that he sought the
top energy post to strengthen his domestic political base after
Federico Pena announced he was stepping down in July to spend more
time with his family. In an interview with the Globe last year,
Richardson said he was interested in running for senator or
governor in New Mexico. Some observers have named him as a
potential running mate for Al Gore in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say that Clinton gave him the job as a reward for
distinguishing himself in a series of diplomatic missions from the
Congo to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who served on the House Energy and Commerce
Committee while in Congress, was especially interested in
deregulating the oil and gas industries and promoting alternative
sources of energy.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, 50, resigned his House seat in February 1997 and,
well liked in Congress, won unanimous Senate confirmation to the
ambassadorship.
</P>
<P>
   One official said that Richardson found the United Nations a
frustrating place to work at times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved the high diplomacy _ making things happen _ but he
was less enamored of the low diplomacy, which is dealing with the
bureaucracy,'' the official said. ``And there is a lot of
bureacracy at the UN.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Richardson has also faced some serious foreign policy
setbacks since coming to the United Nations in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When he took on the top job at the UN, Richardson vowed to
persuade Congress to pay more than $1 billion in back dues to the
United Nations. And he pledged to improve the relationship between
US and the United Nations. More than a year later, the US still
owes the money. And Congress remains as hostile to the
international organization as ever.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Holbrooke, 57, a career diplomat who got his start in Vietnam
in the 1960s, has a reputation as a tough negotiator who gets
things done and doesn't mind bragging about his accomplishments.
But President Clinton passed him over in favor of Madeleine K.
Albright for the secretary of state position.
</P>
<P>
   Friends joke that Holbrooke begins every sentence with the word
`I.' In telling about his efforts to bring peace to Bosnia, he has
criticized his superiors, including President Clinton, for acting
too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   But one official who has worked closely with him said the
president does not take the criticism to heart. ``No one doubts
Dick's negotiating ability or his intellect or charisma,'' the
official said last night. ``The president is his biggest fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke shares with Albright a firm belief in an activist
America that leads allies in peacekeeping. In interviews this month
to promote his book about Bosnia, ``To End a War,'' he has called
for more leadership from Washington in preventing bloodshed in the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The book, which has been praised by many reviewers, urges
Americans to show more decisive leadership in preventing conflicts
around the world. ``The world's richest nation, one that presumes
to great moral authority, cannot simply make worthy appeals to
conscience and call on others to carry the burden,'' Holbrooke
writes. ``The world will look to Washington for more than rhetoric
the next time we face a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   He brokered the Balkan peace accord that ended the Bosnian
conflict in 1995, which got him nominated for the Nobel Peace
Prize. More recently Holbrooke's efforts to defuse tensions between
Greece and Turkey over the disputed island of Cyprus, and his
efforts to mediate an end to Serbia's bloody crackdown on ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, &UR;  &LR; have gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   As a congressman, Richardson negotiated with hostile governments
in Cuba, Iraq, North Korea and Sudan to help secure the release of
11 hostages.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an open secret at the State Department that
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Richardson often do not
get along. While Richardson's fans have delighted in his
world-trotting problem-solving for years, officials say Albright
has disagreed with him several times.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has not been dynamic enough in Albright's views,
according to officials who know them both. Albright has a special
interest in the job because she was widely praised for her tough
talk and behind-the-scenes negotiating when she served as the UN
ambassador during Clinton's first term.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who clearly enjoys publicity, has had to clear his
appearances on Sunday morning television talk shows with Albright's
advisers. Often, officials said, the advisers have ordered
Richardson to stay off the shows in order not to obscure Albright's
message.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's appointment to the top energy post has been in the
works for several weeks. But President Clinton had trouble finding
a suitable replacement to fill the UN post.
</P>
<P>
   Other potential candidates included former Senator George
Mitchell, who negotiated an historic peace settlement in northern
Ireland, and Senator Lee Hamilton, a long-time Congressional
defender of the United Nations. Mitchell, according to diplomats,
was not interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   And an administration official said it was unclear when the two
diplomats would begin their new jobs. Both men will require Senate
approval.

JARVIS MOVES IN AT ST. JOHN'S 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mike Jarvis arrived at St. John's Wednesday for real,
six days after the news conference introducing him as the Red
Storm's new head coach. He is still living out of a suitcase and
calling a hotel home. But at least at the school, he has an office,
a campus that he is now a part of, a home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After eight seasons at George Washington University, it took six
days to cut the cord there, to say good-bye to players and friends.
When he walked into his new office, there were letters of
congratulations from coaches he had walked sidelines opposite 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The move was an emotional one for Jarvis, whose name has been
raised in almost every high-profile coaching search in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made it kind of interesting at the end of each year,'' said
Jack Kvancz, George Washington's athletic director. ``But the
reality of it was, I knew Mike wasn't going to leave us unless it
was a job he really wanted. He may have messed around with other
jobs, but he told me point-blank, it is not going to happen, that
he was just messing around. Other than make things uncomfortable,
it didn't hurt anything. We didn't lose recruits. But now this is a
job he really wanted.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That made St. John's different from his flings with other
schools. He turned down an offer from Boston College last year and
had his name involved in coaching searches at Virginia and Michigan
this year.
</P>
<P>
   When St. John's began its search, Jarvis called, but not to
lobby for himself. He put in a word for Drexel's Bill Herrion. But
when St. John's invited him into the mix, Jarvis was intoxicated by
the thought of entering the New York market with a team steeped in
tradition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When he got the job, it did not make the parting at George
Washington easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had doubts,'' Jarvis said. ``I believe anybody contemplating
a move as serious as this would feel that way. The biggest fear I
had the last couple of years was getting to a point where I was so
comfortable and so content that I wouldn't think about moving.''
</P>
<P>
   First on the agenda is hiring a staff. His son, Mike Jarvis II,
will follow him from George Washington. And his associate head
coach, Kevin Clark, will probably come, too, now that the Colonials
seem poised to name Tom Penders as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   When Jarvis took over at Boston University and George
Washington, each had a losing record; the St. John's cupboard is
stocked. Before he was dismissed, Fran Fraschilla had led the Red
Storm to its first NCAA tournament berth since 1993. A seven-year
contract worth more than $5 million puts Jarvis in the spotlight he
wanted, but also under the pressure of high expectations.
</P>
<P>
   John Calipari, who left the University of Massachusetts of the
Atlantic 10 Conference for the Nets of the National Basketball
Association, identifies with his former rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was ready for it to come in here,'' Calipari said
of the pressure. ``Well, I wasn't. If Mike wants to know what you
don't do, he can call me because I can tell him. I did it all.''

 YANKEE PITCHER STANTON APPEALS SUSPENSION FOR HITTING BATTER  (ja) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Mike Stanton was in his hotel room Wednesday
afternoon when Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, called
to tell the pitcher that the American League had suspended him for
five games, for hitting Baltimore's Eric Davis with a pitch Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding me,'' Stanton replied, and within an hour, he
appealed the ruling. Stanton, who was also fined $1,000, is adamant
that he did not hit Davis on purpose, as Dr. Gene Budig, the league
president, has determined, based on the report filed by the plate
umpire John Hirschbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton will be able to play until his appeal is heard by Budig,
perhaps next Monday, or until he elects to drop the appeal. As of
Wednesday, Stanton intends to fight the ruling vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely unjustified,'' he said. ``I didn't expect any
suspension. I know what was going through my mind, and it
definitely wasn't to hit Eric Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Budig directly tied Stanton's actions to the
perceived intentional throwing incident and ensuing fight between
the Yankees and Orioles on May 19 at Yankee Stadium. That night,
Baltimore's Armando Benitez hit Tino Martinez with a fastball
immediately after allowing a home run to Bernie Williams, sparking
the lengthy brawl.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Stanton hit Davis with a fastball immediately after
allowing a home run to Rafael Palmeiro, although in this instance
no players left the benches or bullpens, and no fighting resulted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled by the dangerous act by Mike Stanton,
especially in view of the recent and high profile brawl involving
the Yankees and Orioles,'' Budig said in his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters directly, Budig later added that his
suspension of Stanton reflected the information in the written
report filed by the umpires.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, said he respects both
Hirschbeck and Budig, but feels they did not have a true
understanding of what occurred. ``You have to have a feel for the
game,'' Torre said, ``to make an evaluation people are going to
live with.''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankee owner, went one step further.
``I'm not sure what Dr. Budig's experience is, but I'm not sure
when the last time he wore a jockstrap was,'' Steinbrenner said of
the league president, who came to his baseball post from the
academic world. ``But Dr. Budig did what he felt was right. Budig
has been all over the lot on this thing. Sometimes he comes down
hard, the next time he doesn't come down hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner paused and added, with sarcasm: ``Dr. Budig says he
was `appalled' _ that's kind of funny. He must've been a very great
chancellor in Kansas. He must be a very good educator.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Miller, the Orioles' manager, had been lobbying for an
eight-game suspension, the same given to Benitez. But after reading
Budig's explanation for giving Stanton five games _ Benitez had
provoked the Yankees after hitting Martinez, but Stanton did no
provoking _ Miller accepted the decision without argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to say I'm disappointed,'' Miller said, ``but I
understand his reasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said of the penalty to Stanton: ``I'm not the judge, man.
I don't make the rules, I just abide by them.''
</P>
<P>
   Budig's action is severe, in comparison with precedents;
pitchers have been ejected for intentionally throwing at batters in
the past and not been suspended at all.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez was ejected for hitting Martinez in June 1995, when
Martinez played for Seattle, and Benitez was not suspended.
</P>
<P>
   In reacting to the Yankees' fight with Baltimore last month, and
in subsequent action, Budig is clearly trying to establish a new
standard of decorum.
</P>
<P>
   But Stanton, the Yankees and the players association are
maintaining the pitcher is being punished unjustly. Stanton, the
Yankees say, would never target Davis, a well-liked and respected
opponent, and a close friend of the Yankees' Darryl Strawberry. &QL;

AIR TRAFFIC RADAR FAILING ALMOST DAILY, CONTROLLERS GROUP SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Air Traffic contollers directing planes flying at high altitudes
over New England and upstate New York have had their radar screens
go blank or freeze on almost a daily basis and they say there are
not enough technicians to keep the system running.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the malfunctions is a computer system installed in
1972 that is failing with increasing frequency. Meanwhile, the
number of technicians certified to repair it have dropped to
dangerously low levels.
</P>
<P>
   While the Federal Aviation Administration acknowledged problems
with the computer system in the Boston Center and at other
facilities around the country, a spokesman said the air traffic
system was safe, and that the agency has no records of failures on
a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers and the technicians who maintain the equipment,
however, say the system is being stretched to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is falling apart,'' said William Johannes,
president of the local chapter of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, representing controllers at the Boston
Center in Nashua, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent example of the erosion of the air traffic system
came on Tuesday, when a controller in New York momentarily lost
track of Air Force Two's speed and altitude as the plane carrying
Vice President Gore approached Newark International Airport. The
DC-9 was 12 minutes from landing late Tuesday afternoon when
crucial data _ the plane's call sign, altitude reading, ground
speed and angle of descent _ disappeared from the controller's
computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers rely on the computers and radar in their effort to
maintain a safe distance between aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency has now placed the national airspace system in
jeopardy by allowing staffing in the radar unit to fall well below
recognized norms,'' said Ed Dressell, the Boston Center local
president of the Professional Airways System Specialists, the union
representing the technicians.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Jim Peters said that safety has not been
compromised by the computer failures. ``Like any piece of
equipment, you will experience problems on an intermitant basis,''
he said, adding that a back-up system has performed whenever the
computer failed.
</P>
<P>
   Peters also said a special team was assigned to the Boston
Center to find the cause of the problems and fix them. An FAA
document obtained by the Boston Globe, however, indicates that that
any fix is at least six months away.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controller's concerns about technician staffing
levels, Peters said the center has adequate manpower.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, seven certified technicians worked at the Boston
Center to keep the computer system running. Today only three
specialists are assigned to maintain a system that has to run 24
hours a day every day of the year. As a result, in the last month
alone, the three qualified technicians have been ordered to work
more than 60 hours of overtime. One of the technicians is eligible
for retirement and Dressell said ``burnout is becoming an issue,''
as the hours required to service the aging system begin to
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of trained technicians to deal with the computer
outages was caused partly by the retirement of many who were not
replaced in the last decade because the FAA believed a new system
would obviate the need for so many technicians. That new system,
however, is still at least two years away.
</P>
<P>
   On May 29, the technicians' union asked the FAA to declare an
emergency situation at the Boston Center, which would have been
politically embarassing, but given the agency greater flexibility
in staffing levels. Instead, the agency earlier this month called
the repeated failures of the system a ``substantial operational
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The controllers union, meanwhile, say the outages have been
occurring at an ``alarming rate'' Johannes said, and last anywhere
from 12 seconds to 2 and a half hours. In 12 seconds, a plane can
travel more than two miles. When longer outages occur, controllers
use a limited back-up system which requires a more time-consuming
process to ``hand off'' a plane from one controller to another
working a different section of air space.
</P>
<P>
   Controllers also are concerned that the back-up may be down for
occasional routine maintenance when the primary system crashes.
``If that happens, we won't have radar contact with anyone,''
Johannes said.
</P>
<P>
   But, countered the FAA's Peters, even in that unlikely situation
controllers would still have radio contact with the airplanes and
could slow all air traffic down considerably and increase the
separation between planes to ensure there is no mid-air collision.
</P>
<P>
   The computer system that has been failing provides controllers
with all the information on their radar screens. When the system
fails the screens either freeze or go blank, both the radar hit of
the plane and the data block that indicates the plane type, flight
number, airspeed and altitude, disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When aircraft aren't displayed on radar scopes, controllers
are blind to aircraft and cannot protect the flying public,'' said
Scott Hayden, the local union vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One disappeared twice in recent months from radar
screens of the coast of New Jersey, due to problems with the radar
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air Force One is not the only plane disappaearing from radar
screens,'' said Hayden. ``Unfortunately, these things happen every
day to other aircraft as well.''

ON TRACK FOR A TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jerome Davis has never had a lack for motivation.
USC's quarter-miler is reminded of the 28 national titles and the
34 Olympic gold medalists each time he passes through USC's
Heritage Hall.
</P>
<P>
   For Davis, the memory of his older brother, Eddie, who died of
stomach cancer at age 24 in 1995, has been the biggest source of
inspiration. Jerome wears a gold necklace belonging to his brother
with the letter ``E'' as a tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I step onto the track, I am praying,'' said Davis,
20. ``I wish Eddie could be in the stands watching, but I know he
is with me, helping me deal with all the pain and pressure. I don't
get discouraged because I know he can help me do it. I feel this
comfort. I have no fear. I just know that I am going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie played basketball at Cerro Coso and Butte colleges. Among
his last words to Jerome was encouragement to finish high school
and obtain a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we were seven years apart, we would always talk,''
said Jerome, the youngest of three children. ``We were like best
friends. The year he passed away, I was having problems with the
SAT and I thought there was no way I would pass the entrance exam
to USC. Everything seemed to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   On the track, Jerome, who will compete in the 400 meters in the
USA Track &AMP; Field Championships in New Orleans, has also blossomed.
</P>
<P>
   Davis ran a personal-best 45.18 seconds to notch an upset
victory in the NCAA championships in Buffalo two weeks ago. Davis
defeated a field which included 1996 NCAA champion Davian Clark of
Miami _ a 1996 Olympic finalist for Jamaica _ to become the first
USC athlete to win the 400 since Quincy Watts in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Davis tuned up for the NCAA meet by winning his third
consecutive Pacific 10 Conference title, a feat accomplished only
once before in the past two decades. In April, Davis knocked off
1997 World Championship bronze medalist Tyree Washington to win the
400 at the Mt. San Antonio College Relays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at them as favorites,'' Davis said. ``I just look
at them as somebody who has run faster times than I have. The only
way you can get something is to take it from them. I don't really
focus on a person as I do myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The main focus for the 6-foot-2, 183-pound Davis was basketball
despite clocking 46.62 and reaching the state high school 400 final
twice, including a third-place finish as a senior in 1995. Davis
never dreamed of winning an NCAA title in track.
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Ron Allice saw something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has something in his chest cavity that it takes to be a
successful quarter-miler,'' Allice said. ``You have to have a good
pain threshold. He handles pressure well. He has an inner strength
that is not always commonplace. He has so many pluses that a NCAA
title is an end result.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis has also made his mark on the world scene. Last summer, he
anchored the U.S. 1,600-meter relay team to victory in the World
University Games in Italy. In 1996, Davis was captain of the U.S.
team in the World Junior Championships in Sydney, Australia,
winning gold medals in the 400- and 1,600-meter relays and a silver
in the 400.
</P>
<P>
   Davis credits his steady rise at USC to Allice, a former
440-yard school record-holder at Long Beach State, as well as
guidance from Trojans women's coach Barbara Edmonson, a former
world record-holder at 50, 100 and 200 meters and a 1968 Olympic
gold medalist in the 400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing they stress is you have to work hard and want
it,'' Davis said. ``I am glad my progression hasn't been a big
drop. If God let me run any faster, then what is there to come. I
probably wouldn't graduate and would drop out of school. It's been
a slow progression and I can see myself working up the ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, Davis will be looking for a sub-45 clocking and
a berth in the eight-man final. At last year's national
championships, Davis advanced to the semifinals with only a week's
rest after the NCAA championships. This year, he has had an extra
week between the meets and didn't start racing until April in
anticipation for a good showing at the USA championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I have a nice target on my back,'' Davis said. ``A lot of
people are going to be looking at me and say I got lucky at the
NCAA meet. People are going to want to come after me, but you have
to go into a race thinking no one can beat you. Anybody still there
with you in the last 100 meters is in for a fight. They're going to
have to dig deep with some type of heart that they have never used
if they intend to beat you.''

SELIG REPORTEDLY WILL ACCEPT POST AS BASEBALL COMMISSIONER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The search for a baseball commissioner is over. It did not stray
an inch from where it began.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, who has served in the role of commissioner for nearly
six years without having the title, has decided to accept the job
he had resisted taking, several people in ownership and
high-ranking positions in Major League Baseball said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two people, one a high-ranking official in baseball and one who
is not in baseball but has close contacts with people in the
sport's hierarchy, said an announcement could be made by the
All-Star Game, which is July 7. An owner said it could be
forthcoming in two to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The naming of Selig should surprise no one, inside or outside
baseball. ``It's one of the great anticlimaxes of all time,'' one
former official said.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, who will be 64 next month, has said for several years he
did not want to be commissioner. But he never said he would flatly
refuse to accept the position. Overwhelming support from owners for
him to take the job made it possible for him to agree to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``An almost unified ownership came to him and said you've got to
do it; you're the only one,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   An owner described a scene at a meeting involving Jerry
McMorris, owner of the Colorado Rockies and chairman of the
commissioner search committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``McMorris is sitting there saying we have some candidates we
should interview,'' the owner related. But, the owner added,
``What's the sense of doing that when the answer is sitting right
there?''
</P>
<P>
   Several people said only two or three owners oppose the idea of
Selig as commissioner. All of them named Jerry Reinsdorf of the
Chicago White Sox as one. Others identified were Peter Magowan of
the San Francisco Giants and The Tribune Co., owner of the Chicago
Cubs. But one person said the Giants had only recently heard about
the development and were not sure what the Giants' position would
be.
</P>
<P>
   Two people said it was possible that when it came to an official
vote, even the clubs opposed might vote for Selig. Election of a
commissioner requires a three-fourths majority of the 30 clubs,
including at least five votes in each league.
</P>
<P>
   No action was taken at the owners' regular quarterly meeting in
Seattle last week, but one person said it was ``certainly being
discussed in the corridors.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig was in Houston for an Astros' news conference Wednesday
and did not respond to a message left with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball has been without a commissioner since Fay
Vincent, the eighth commissioner, resigned under pressure on Sept.
7, 1992. Two days later, Selig was named chairman of the executive
council, which runs baseball in the absence of a commissioner. He
has been in charge since, most often referred to as interim
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has been criticized for not having a commissioner.
Members of Congress have been among the critics, though none has
been heard from for several years, or since the players strike of
1994-95 was settled.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Selig is officially confirmed and introduced as the
ninth commissioner, it is unlikely that changes will be noticeable.
Selig has always operated with a consensus of owners and will
continue to do so. He rarely has taken action without knowing he
has enough votes for his position.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, owners are happy with the presence since last July
of Paul Beeston in the New York office as president and chief
operating officer of Major League Baseball. Beeston's role is
believed to have influenced Selig to accept the top job. From the
day Beeston, who formerly was president of the Toronto Blue Jays,
took his job, he has urged Selig to become the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Beeston declined to comment on the development, saying only: ``A
lot of people are talking about Bud being commissioner. I hope he
considers it and takes the position.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Selig is president, chief executive officer and operating owner
of the Milwaukee Brewers. Some owners had previously expressed
concern about an owner being commissioner, but that concern
evidently has been satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   One person said he thought Selig would put his share of the
Brewers in a trust.
</P>
<P>
   One problem Selig may have is public acceptance of him as
commissioner. His was the anguished face that fans saw throughout
the 234-day strike, and it was he who announced cancellation of the
1994 World Series. The absence of the World Series even more than
the strike itself was the development that turned many fans against
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Another matter will be management's relationship with the
players union. During his three-year term, Vincent made a good
start in developing a positive and peaceful relationship with the
union, though some owners criticized him for his cordial relations
with players.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Selig and Donald Fehr, head of the
union, deteriorated badly during the labor dispute and ensuing
strike, reaching the point where Fehr didn't even want to talk to
Selig.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's acceptance of the job prompted a question from some
people in baseball of whether or not Selig was really sincere in
his repeated insistence that he didn't want the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole thing was orchestrated,'' said a senior
executive of one club. ``He was telling a small group of people
from day one he wanted it but told everyone else he didn't. Then
came the draft and he said he would accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same executive was critical of the search for a
commissioner, which he called a sham. An earlier search also ended
in no appointment when a group of owners submitted a letter to the
executive council saying they were not prepared to elect a new
commissioner and preferred that Selig remain in charge until the
labor dispute was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Selig's last known salary as chairman of the executive council
was $1.5 million a year. One lawyer who works in baseball said he
heard Selig's salary as commissioner would be $2.5 million, but no
officials were able to confirm that figure. &QL;

HUNDLEY NEARS A NO-TRADE CLAUSE IN PACT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Early Wednesday, the New York Mets' co-owner Fred
Wilpon had again stressed the organization's desire to keep both
Todd Hundley and Mike Piazza happy. It could soon be a case of one
down, one to go, as it appears General Manager Steve Phillips is
close to an agreement with Hundley on a no-trade clause that could
run up to the All-Star Game break in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Phillips nor Hundley's representative, Seth Levinson,
was available for comment and the Mets had not announced anything
by game-time Wednesday night. But a person familiar with the
negotiations indicated this evening that the Mets were close to
granting Hundley the clause he has been seeking since the Mets
acquired Piazza from the Florida Marlins on May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are also discussing a compromise on 12 teams that
Hundley could be traded to after next season's All-Star Game, which
would grant the All-Star catcher some of the job security that he
felt he had lost with the acquisition of Piazza, the Mets' current
All-Star catcher. Hundley hasn't played this season, and he isn't
expected back until mid-July because of elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That compromise would give Phillips some flexibility down the
road if the Mets come to the conclusion that Hundley _ who now
seems clearly targeted for the Mets' outfield _ is unable to make
the transition to another position. What the Mets had feared was
that they would have no place to play Hundley should that happen.
And Hundley's contract, which will pay him $4.8 million this
season, $5.2 million next season and $6 million in 2000, does not
expire until after the 2000 season, with the Mets holding an option
to either buy out Hundley for $500,000 or keep him for another $6
million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If the two sides can reach an agreement, the next step for the
Mets is to re-sign Piazza, who becomes a free agent at the end of
the season. He will be seeking a multiyear contract in the $100
million range. Apart from the money, the Mets also need to make
Piazza feel comfortable that he is the Mets' starting catcher and
his status will not be threatened by Hundley's presence. All
indications are that Wilpon and the co-owner Nelson Doubleday have
authorized Phillips to proceed with those negotiations as he sees
fit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Wilpon had sounded as if he thought Phillips
and Levinson were close to an agreement on the no-trade clause.
``The Mets' organization wants Todd on this team and playing with
this team, which includes Mike Piazza and others,'' Wilpon said.
``Steve is trying to work that out and Nelson and myself are all
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundley is also feeling optimistic. He said this weekend that
his gut feeling, in light of the Mets' trade for Piazza and of the
organization's ensuing treatment of Hundley, was that the Mets
would deal him to a noncontending team, which is why he and
Levinson have asked for the no-trade provision that would allow
them to veto trades to certain organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Wilpon had spoken earlier this week of his special fondness
for the 29-year-old Hundley, both as an individual and for what he
has done for the Mets in his dozen years with the organization.
That may have been one reason Levinson sounded optimistic on
Tuesday night that something could be worked out soon.
</P>
<P>
   There is no timetable set for Hundley's return to the team. But
Hundley has been learning to play the outfield at the Mets' minor
league complex in Port St. Lucie, Fla., and he has begun to take
live batting practice. Hundley will still have to undertake a
rehabilitation assignment in the minors before he is ready to
rejoin the Mets, but it is still possible that he could be back
around the All-Star Game break, July 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   That would enable Hundley to hit behind Piazza in the lineup,
providing an excellent opportunity for just the sort of chemistry
Wilpon believes can help propel the Mets to a post-season berth.  &QL;

AFTER GUILTY PLEA, COMPANY CALLS PAYMENTS LEGAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hours after pleading guilty in a major bribery case
Wednesday, Structure Tone Inc., one of the largest construction
companies in Manhattan, seemed to be having second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of five companies that admitted in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan on Wednesday that it had participated in a
scheme to rig the bidding on $2 billion worth of renovation work
for companies like Sony Corp., Credit Suisse First Boston, Morgan
Stanley, Bertelsmann AG and Gleacher &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Under a plea agreement with the Manhattan district attorney,
Robert Morgenthau, Structure Tone agreed to pay $10 million in lieu
of fines and forfeiture of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours later, Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for Structure
Tone, issued a statement saying the contractor had merely paid
``legitimate sales commissions,'' not bribes, to obtain a $500
million contract at the Sony Building, at 550 Madison Ave. and 56th
Street. Structure Tone, the statement added, was a ``victim'' of
the bid-rigging scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the company, which has hired several lawyers
and two public relations consultants, brought an angry response
from the district attorney's office and conflicted with Structure
Tone's admissions in court Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the district attorney's office said it did not want to
put the contractors out of business, Structure Tone and the others
who pleaded guilty Wednesday are very concerned that they will be
forever tainted by the scandal. One company at the center of the
scheme, Bennis &AMP; Reissman, has closed, and others have lost work
because of the publicity. Structure Tone is the only one to issue a
news release or grant an interview, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Structure Tone press statement is flatly contradicted by
the guilty plea they entered in open court,'' said Daniel
Castleman, chief of investigations for the district attorney. ``In
pleading guilty, Structure Tone admitted that it paid a bribe to
Bennis &AMP; Reissman, albeit through a middleman, to get the Sony
contract. The fact that Structure Tone pleaded guilty to commercial
bribery and has agreed to pay $10 million speaks for itself.''

MAJOR ISSUES UNRESOLVED AS ALBANY SESSION DRAWS TO CLOSE
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ As one of the most sluggish legislative sessions
in memory drew toward a close Wednesday, lawmakers remained deeply
divided on a host of major issues, from changing parole rules to
creating charter schools to expanding health care for poor
children.
</P>
<P>
   With the state legislature pressing to complete its business by
Thursday, Gov. George Pataki and the leaders of the Democrat-led
Assembly and the Republican-controlled State Senate said they could
not agree on the legislation to end parole for all violent
offenders, one of the governor's major election-year initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects also looked dim for about a dozen other issues,
including a bill to provide health care for poor children up to age
18 and a plan to create charter schools that are publicly financed
but operate independently of local school boards.
</P>
<P>
   The session-ending malaise comes two months after the
legislature broke with its tradition of having extraordinarily late
budgets and passed a record $71.6 billion budget that included
generous spending on schools and tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the last few weeks have been bogged down in
election-year politics and the animosity between the Republican
governor and the Democratic Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver. The
gridlock is such that Pataki had scheduled a trip to Buffalo
Wednesday to sign copies of his recently released autobiography.
But he decided to cancel the trip to be on hand in the State
Capitol just in case there might be a breakthrough on any of the
legislative fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to meet through the afternoon and into the
evening until we close on some of the issues or recognize that we
can't,'' Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader, told reporters
on Wednesday morning after emerging from a meeting with Pataki and
Silver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we agree on,'' he said, ``is that we will be
closed by tomorrow night.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and legislative leaders directed their staffs to work
through the night to try to seal some deals.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders have managed to reach agreement in a few areas. The
most significant is a bill that would provide the largest increase
ever in pension benefits for the more than 300,000 current and
retired state employees. It now goes to the governor, who has said
he would be open to a ``reasonable'' pension bill.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, retired employees would get pension
increases ranging from 1.44 to 10.30 percent based on when they
retired. The larger increases would go to the people who have been
retired the longest because the value of their pensions has been
eroded by inflation. Current employees, upon retirement, would have
their pensions set on a new formula that provides increases to
account for current inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation did not establish a permanent system of
cost-of-living increases as the public employee unions had wanted.
But union leaders said it helped fix a basic inequity in the
pension system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased with this agreement,'' said Denyce Duncan Lacy,
a spokeswoman for the State Public Employees Federation. ``But
we'll be back again next year lobbying for a permanent solution to
the pension.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislature also agreed on a bill that would extend for
another two and a half years a landmark program that required the
state to begin closing its expensive and outdated psychiatric
hospitals and to use the savings to expand a wide range of
community mental health programs. The program, which was set to
expire in 10 months, was intended to revolutionize care for the
mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is expected to be passed by both houses on
Thursday and to be sent to the governor for approval. Zenia Mucha,
a spokeswoman for Pataki, said the administration was unaware of
the legislation but would be open to considering it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday evening, the leaders of the Assembly said they
would pass legislation that begins the process of legalizing casino
gambling in New York. But it was not clear if the Assembly proposal
would be accepted by the Senate, where a similar measure was
defeated. The legislation would allow casinos in the Niagara
Falls-Buffalo area, in the Catskills and in Warren County in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and the legislative leaders remained far apart on
Wednesday on other major issues, though their differences could be
resolved in the flurry of legislative horse-trading that has
historically dominated the end of session.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs that legislative leaders, particularly Silver,
would be willing to compromise on issues dear to the administration
in return for Pataki's agreement to restore some of the $1.6
billion he cut from the budget that the legislature sent to him in
April.
</P>
<P>
   One area for potential compromise is the governor's proposal to
create independently run charter schools that would be an
alternative to public schools. Silver has blocked the proposal but
has left open the possibility that he would support it if the
governor agreed to restore money for teacher salaries, school
construction and repairs and other areas in the budget, according
to people with knowledge of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Another major piece of legislation still being negotiated
involves ending discretionary parole for all violent felons. Pataki
and his allies in the Senate have been pushing hard to get the bill
enacted. But the Democrats in the Assembly have said that they will
only agree to such a bill if it includes a provision allowing some
low-level offenders to attend drug treatment programs instead of
going to prison. So far, Republicans have rejected that provision.

JAN GULLBERG, 62, SWEDISH SCIENCE WRITER  
 FRANCIS LEE, COMBAT CAMERAMAN, 85 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Jan Gullberg, a Swedish surgeon and anesthesiologist whose
fascination with mathematics and science in general led him to
write two books whose explanations of rarefied subjects to the
layman were widely praised, died on May 21 at the hospital where he
worked, near his home in Nordfjordeid, Norway. He was 62.
 &HT;    The cause was a stroke, his North American publisher, W.W.
Norton &AMP; Co. of New York, said this month in announcing his death.
 &HT;    Gullberg, who was born and raised in Sweden, worked as a general
surgeon in Sweden and in the United States at Virginia Mason
Hospital in Seattle after earning a medical degree at the
University of Lund in 1964.
 &HT;    Continuing his studies as he practiced, he wrote his first book,
an 1,100-page volume in Swedish that gave an overview of basic
science.
 &HT;    It sold more than 8,000 copies, which, in Sweden, is a highly
respectable figure for a book of its nature.
 &HT;    He followed that up with an illustrated, 1,100-page book about
mathematics and its history, written in English, ``Mathematics:
From the Birth of Numbers'' (1997), which is now in its fifth
printing.
 &HT;    It was a main selection of the Library of Science and an
alternate selection of the Book of the Month Club.
 &HT;    Gullberg is survived by his wife, Ann, and their sons, Kamen and
Kalin. Also surviving are three children from his earlier marriage
to Anne-Marie Hallin, who died in 1983, Par, Karin and Annika.

   NEW YORK _ Francis Lee, a combat cameraman who documented the
D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944 and was a member of an
avant-garde film movement, died on May 29 at a nursing home in
Manhattan. He was 85 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was taken to New York from Sicily as a child and began to
work in experimental film in 1939 with a movie camera and editing
equipment he bought with a small inheritance. In World War II he
joined the infantry and, assigned as a combat cameraman, shot some
500,000 feet of film. Thirty years later, he retrieved much of that
film and fashioned it into a 20-minute documentary. After the war
he worked as a commercial filmmaker and taught at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Michael Lee.

CHIEF PROSECUTOR CALLS FOR GREATER EFFORT TO EXPLAIN `MEGAN'S LAW'
</HEADLINE>
   (ja)  
 By ROBERT HANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ A day after shots were fired at the house
where a paroled rapist lives, New Jersey's chief law enforcement
officer told prosecutors on Wednesday to combat vigilantism by
doing more to educate the public about ``Megan's Law.''
</P>
<P>
   In a directive to the state's 21 county prosecutors, Attorney
General Peter Verniero said that better community education was the
best way to reduce the confusion, misinformation, anger and fear
surrounding the law, which permits warnings about sex offenders
deemed potentially dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incumbent on us to redouble our efforts in light of
yesterday's incident,'' he said in the directive.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, most county prosecutors have focused on explaining
the law and all its requirements to municipal police chiefs and
school superintendents and principals.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero said in an interview that he was not trying ``to
suggest the offices are not doing their job.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I want them to increase their efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero issued the order as detectives tried to find out who
fired five bullets early Tuesday into a house in Linden that
included the basement apartment of a paroled rapist. The bullets
pierced the windows and walls of a first-floor apartment while its
resident, Joan Bazydlo, watched television. Neither she nor the
parolee, Frank Penna, 55, were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred 10 days after Linden police gave neighbors
fliers telling them of Penna's presence and including his name,
address, description and photograph. Penna was convicted of
kidnapping and raping two teen-agers in 1976 and was paroled in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero called the shooting the first case of vigilantism since
the state won a long court fight over ``Megan's Law'' this year and
resumed issuing public notices about paroled offenders that
prosecutors have classified as posing moderate or high risks of
committing new sex crimes.
</P>
<P>
   On July 9, a federal appeals court in Philadelphia is to hold a
hearing on another constitutional challenge that the New Jersey
public defender's office has filed against the law. This challenge
deals with sex offenders convicted and sentenced after passage of
the law in 1994. The earlier case, which ended in February when the
U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, dealt with those sentenced
before passage.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Buncher, a deputy public defender who helped prepare the
case, said the gunfire at the house where Penna lived could be
relevant to his office's contention that the notifications violated
the privacy rights of parolees. But Buncher said his office had not
decided whether to include the Linden gunfire case in its arguments
to the court.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have expressed fears that public acts of
violence against parolees could jeopardize the law in the courts.
Verniero said Wednesday that he was not worried about one isolated
incident. ``If we saw repeated, constant vigilantism, that would
give me more concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his directive, Verniero said his office and the county
prosecutors, who oversee both the risk classification system and
the notification campaign, ``must be equally resolute'' in
expanding community education to prevent vigilantism.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the public, he said, believe incorrectly that
they will be told about every paroled sex offender in their
neighborhood. ``Others question the efficacy of the law,'' he
wrote. ``By explaining the law to them, answering their questions
and detailing how local law enforcement officials are handling the
situation, the sense of frustration that often leads to rash or
criminal behavior is reduced.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero said he wants prosecutors to stress that the state will
not tolerate vigilantism. He said the prosecutors could spread that
message and other details about the law to parent-teacher
associations, civic and religious groups, neighborhood watch
programs and other community groups.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero said the prosecutors have enough staff members in their
``Megan's Law'' units for increased public appearances. He also
said that deputies in his office's speakers bureau will discuss the
law more often in their engagements and that he will talk about it
more in his speeches.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lawyers who have denounced the law since its passage in late
1994 said the notification system guarantees violence, threats and
harassment against paroled sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Martone, executive director of the New Jersey branch of
the American Civil Liberties Union, said, ``There will always be
one or two people in the hundreds you've told who, despite
admonitions, will say, `I don't want that time bomb next to me.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Furlong, a lawyer who assists paroled offenders in
challenging risk classifications, said the public despises sex
offenders more than murderers. Public notifications, he said,
create scare-mongering and harassment. ``I don't expect a rational
response from a politicized public,'' Furlong said. ``The law
appeals to the basest instinct in all of us to cast the demons out
of our midst.''
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation of Tuesday's shooting continued, the Union
County Crimestoppers Organization, a group of law enforcement
officials and business executives, offered a reward of as much as
$5,000 for information leading to the arrest and indictment of
anyone responsible for the shooting.

GIULIANI GIVES SIDEWALK VENDORS A REPRIEVE
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sidewalk vendors, who had faced banishment from many
of their most lucrative corners, won a reprieve Wednesday when
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani took the rare step of backing off a major
crusade in his quality-of-life campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani administration officials, who dominate the city panel
that determines where vending is allowed, voted to rescind the
144-block ban on vending that was to take effect next month and to
reconsider later this summer after seeking additional testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan's financial district, some customers toasted the
decision with bottles of Snapple bought from their favorite
vendors' carts. But few peddlers joined in the celebration, saying
that they believed they had won just a temporary reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Deputy Mayor Rudy Washington said the administration
planned to pursue the regulation of vendors. He said the panel, the
Street Vendor Review Panel, was re-examining its votes of May 20 on
the advice of lawyers and in response to public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that as soon as we close one block, we're off to
court,'' Washington said. ``It doesn't hurt anything to take a
second, back up and take in more evidence. We'll have a more
bulletproof case, and at the same time do the right thing that
strikes the right balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ester Fuchs, a professor of political science at Barnard College
and a persistent Giuliani critic, said that the mayor would have
risked permanent damage to his reputation if he had pursued plans
to put strong limits on vending.
</P>
<P>
   ``His targets since the last election have been the
disenfranchised, or people who have little political power,'' she
said. ``The piece of this puzzle which the mayor forgot was that
the patrons of the street vendors are generally working people who
probably voted for Rudy Giuliani.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the mayor's top advisers, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Giuliani had no intention of abandoning his
crackdown on vendors since he still felt that street peddlers
undermined civility by causing congestion and sanitation problems.
But one of these advisers said the mayor realized he had
``articulated badly'' his reasons for the crackdown. The other said
the mayor was concerned about being perceived as ``governing by
fiat.''
</P>
<P>
   At his daily news conference Wednesday, Giuliani said that he
and his panel were trying to ``strike the right balance'' between
street vendors and restaurants, which lose money to the carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they wanted to do was to listen to more businesses and
more vendors to make sure that the plan they put into effect is a
sensitive one and a good one and accomplishes the purpose of
allowing people to remain in business, and doesn't have a
deleterious effect on the businesses that presently exist,''
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he had not yet decided what changes the review
panel _ made up of three Giuliani appointees and one member named
by the City Council _ should make.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Cicio, president of the largest trade group, the Big
Apple Food Vendors Association, laughed when he was told about the
panel's action. ``This is a just a smoke screen,'' he said. ``They
got a lot of bad press, and they realized they made a mistake. It
got a little too hot in the kitchen, so they shut off the burners.
But this mayor is not giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cicio said he was pinning his hopes on the City Council, which
is considering at least three bills to disband the Street Vendor
Review Panel and regulate the carts another way.

FORMER STATE SENATOR FROM BRONX IS INDICTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Pedro Espada Jr., a former state senator who built a
health clinic in the Bronx into a powerful political empire, was
arraigned Wednesday along with two of his employees on charges that
they illegally diverted $221,000 in Medicaid funds to the failed
1996 re-election campaigns of Espada and his son, Pedro Gautier
Espada, then an assemblyman.
</P>
<P>
   Espada immediately denounced the indictment as a political
vendetta backed by the leadership of the Bronx Democratic Party,
with whom he and his family have been embroiled in a long and
bitter feud.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment followed a two-year investigation by the Bronx
district attorney, Robert Johnson, that began when a state appeals
court cited rampant fraud in the collection of the Espadas' ballot
petition signatures and barred the candidates from the 1996
Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Bronx assistant district attorney, Eric Hirsch,
the investigation revealed that the elder Espada and the two
employees, Sandra Love and John Connors, had directed to the
campaign coffers payments ranging from $18,000 to $85,000 from a
health-maintenance organization for Medicaid-eligible patients that
Espada had formed in the Soundview section of the Bronx in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money didn't go to pay health care providers for treating
needy patients,'' Hirsch said. Instead, the money was used to pay
for campaign expenses, including radio and television
advertisements, mailings, posters and photographers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsch said Espada and the two employees concealed the
disbursements by falsely listing them as prepaid marketing expenses
on an annual report to the State Department of Health by Universal
Health Plan. The plan is a health maintenance organization
affiliated with Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in the Bronx and that
falls under the umbrella of Espada's Comprehensive Community
Development Corp., a web of health and social service agencies
based at Soundview Health Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love, a longtime aide to Espada, is the senior vice
president of Soundview Health Center and a board member of
Universal Health Plan. Connors is executive director of the health
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Espada, Ms. Love and Connors all pleaded not guilty to three
counts of second-degree grand larceny, as well as one count each of
second-degree grand larceny, falsifying business records and
offering a false instrument for filing. Each was released on
$25,000 bail. If convicted of second-degree grand larceny, each
faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison. Espada's son, who
is now a city councilman, was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative Judge Burton Roberts presided over the
arraignment. The case was assigned to Justice Daniel Fitzgerald of
state Supreme Court in the Bronx, who was chosen at random from a
list of seven ``judges who have no political roots in the Bronx,''
Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   In an elaborate rally on the steps of the Bronx County Building
after his arraignment, Espada described the criminal charges as the
culmination of a bitter, longstanding feud between his family and
the Bronx Democratic organization.
</P>
<P>
   Standing behind eight boys and girls who sang a few lines of the
pop song ``I Believe I Can Fly,'' Espada accused the district
attorney and Democratic leaders of conspiring in a political witch
hunt against him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence of their criminality is available,'' Espada said,
alluding to a videotape his son had secretly recorded of a
conversation on May 23 between his son and state Sen. David Rosado,
who holds Espada's old seat. ``Their conspiracy cannot go
unpunished.''
</P>
<P>
   On the tape, Espada's son said, Rosado boasted of the Democratic
Party's ability to influence the district attorney to call off the
investigation if Espada pledged not to run for state Senate. Rosado
said Johnson had passed information about the Espada investigation
to the party through the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer,
the younger Espada said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado has said that he was lying at the time to serve his own
political purpose, eliminating Espada as a potential opponent. And
Wednesday, Johnson denied conveying information about the Espada
investigation to any elected official. He characterized Espada's
allegations as a diversionary tactic. ``I know what I've done, I
know why I've done it, and I know it's not political,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Espada, who announced his candidacy for his old Senate seat last
week, demanded the ousters of Johnson, Ferrer and the Bronx
Democratic leader, Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his own race, Espada said, his brother, Jose
Espada, is planning to run for the Assembly seat now held by Ruben
Diaz Jr., and his son, the councilman, will run for Democratic
district leader.

CLASSIC CHIN MUSIC  
 OLD PRACTICE OF RETALIATION DRAWS SCRUTINY AFTER BRAWLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roland Hemond recalls the time Charlie Grimm, the former Cubs
first baseman and manager, went to home plate and lay down in the
batter's box after a teammate blasted a home run.
</P>
<P>
   A puzzled umpire asked, ``What are you doing, Grimm?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure,'' Grimm answered, ``I'm going to be down here in a
few seconds, anyway. I might as well start from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemond, the Diamondbacks' vice president of baseball operations,
has dozens of stories about the ``beanball.'' It is the game played
inside the game _ pitchers taking aim at hitters for a variety of
real or perceived indiscretions _ and it has been around since
baseball's inception. Hitters and pitchers. Dogs and cats. Same
deal. Each wants to own the plate. The ball is often a mediator
that only pours fuel on the fire.
</P>
<P>
   But in today's game, instead of accepting or making light of the
expected knockdown pitch as Grimm did, the hitter goes to the plate
with malice aforethought and designs to storm the mound.
</P>
<P>
   And the altercation, should it erupt into a bench-clearing
brawl, would be the lead-in on ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' for a week,
instead of being the one-day story it was in daily newspapers years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The game hasn't changed. Baseball has always had its own
on-field code of self-policing. The times and attitudes have
changed, and modern electronics brings brawls _ disturbing to most
_ into our living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been this way in baseball,'' Hall of Famer Rod
Carew said. ``You can tell when someone is throwing at someone
intentionally, and you can tell when a pitch just gets away. I
believe in retaliating, but there are ways to do it without getting
anyone hurt. You can throw at their butt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worse when I was playing, but hitters never dove out
across the plate like they do now. You never showed up pitchers the
way they do now. These things have been going on since they started
playing baseball. It's not going to change, and I don't want it to
change. But it should be handled in a more professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemond agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days, players would run out and nobody would throw
any punches,'' Hemond said. ``Nowadays, it seems more instigated,
and punches are thrown. I don't know if it's the change in society
or what, but we have to find a way to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of frightening bench-clearing brawls between the
Yankees and Orioles, and the Royals and Angels this year,
baseball's acting commissioner, Bud Selig, is taking steps in that
direction.
</P>
<P>
   He has instructed Paul Beeston, chief operating officer of Major
League Baseball; American League President Gene Budig; and National
League President Leonard Coleman to devise solutions to prevent
brawls.
</P>
<P>
   Selig said he wants to protect the image and integrity of the
game. As an owner, he also wants to protect the health of players.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks learned the point, painfully. The future of
minor league pitching prospect Ynocencio de la Cruz is in question
after he underwent surgery to repair a separation in his throwing
shoulder. It was the result of a beanball-induced brawl May 28
while he was pitching for South Bend in the Class A Midwest League.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an outstanding prospect, but it's difficult for a pitcher
to come back from an injury like that,'' Diamondbacks Manager Buck
Showalter said. ``I saw the same thing with Brien Taylor (No. 1
draft pick of the Yankees, who had shoulder surgery after an
off-field fight). He is really struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   So what changes can we to look for from the group studying ways
to eliminate such incidents?
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to focus on everything,'' Selig said. ``Violence
has always been part of the game, but it's now at a point it has to
stop. I want them to explore all areas of the game. I have strong
feelings on this.''
</P>
<P>
   If Selig &AMP; Co. can get the players' union to agree, the result
will likely produce a system of heavier fines and more painful
suspensions for players who leave their bench or position to make a
melee.
</P>
<P>
   In the NHL and NBA, players leaving the bench to join a fight
are subject to five-figure fines (up to $25,000 in the NBA) and
suspension with loss of pay. Additionally, NBA teams are fined a
minimum of $5,000 if a player leaves the bench to fight.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, baseball suspends. But with today's salary structure, the
fines of $500 and $1,000 are chicken feed. Plus, players are still
paid while serving suspensions. Tender justice.
</P>
<P>
   Budig drew praise for his eight-game suspension of Anaheim
Manager Terry Collins and his Kansas City counterpart, Tony Muser,
for failing to control their players. But what did he accomplish?
Anaheim has been on a tear, and Kansas City, which had been
struggling, has played .500 ball.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter isn't sure of the value of punishing managers in that
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, I've never been suspended . . . but the year is
young,'' he said. ``I've never been in that position. I imagine
it's different for each manager. Some guys are more hands-on, and
others delegate more authority.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter says, considering that teams play 162 regular-season
games, instances of violence are far fewer in baseball than other
sports, although he quickly adds it's nothing to be proud about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say something contradicting Bud or Gene because
they've done more research and have more time to analyze what's
going on,'' Showalter said. ``But it's part of the game. Any time
you have competitive people doing something that means a lot to
them, they're going to go about it passionately and protect their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (baseball officials) step in when they feel the sport
isn't controlling itself within the lines. Baseball polices itself
from within. You can't make a second baseman sit for three innings
in a penalty box. You can't call a technical foul and give somebody
a run. For the most part, the game has done a good job of policing
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Brenly, the Diamondbacks' television analyst, served a
14-day suspension a few years ago for joining a melee when he was
San Francisco's bullpen coach. He said it had little effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could still throw batting practice and warm up the pitcher,
as long as I was off the field and out of the clubhouse by game
time,'' he said. ``In fact, it helped in a way. I did radio work
for three days during it, and it helped lead to what I'm doing
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be stiffer fines for leaving the bench. A $500
fine today is nothing _ it's like losing meal money. Something is
needed like hockey's third-man-in rule. What happens is you get
players milling around and somebody throws a cheap shot from the
outside. If they weren't there, it wouldn't happen.''

GOLFERS SIGH WITH RELIEF OVER RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Amateur golfers, as well as the professionals
who are playing in this week's U.S. Open, breathed a collective
sigh of relief Thursday when the U.S. Golf Association announced
that it will not ban oversize titanium drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But this is as far as those products can go, the USGA indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is what is around the corner,'' said Buzz Taylor,
the USGA president. ``We are perfectly satisfied with what is out
there now, but our concern is for the future of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation for weeks that the USGA would move to
ban the high-tech clubs because they are sending the ball too far,
making courses obsolete. The media hyped it, and the leading club
manufacturers took out full-page advertisements in several national
publications that warned the USGA that any such ban would be met
with litigation.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the USGA's news conference centered on a new
test that will measure objectively the ``spring-like effect'' in
clubheads. The test, which has yet to defined, will be based on the
rebound velocity of a golf ball off a clubface, the USGA said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1984, the Rules of Golf have stated that ``the material
and construction of the club shall not have the effect at impact of
a spring (Rule 4-1e).''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the literal sense, all clubs have some spring-like effect
because all clubs deform at impact,'' said David Fay, executive
director of the USGA.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the USGA plans a test. Particulars will be released
to club manufacturers within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent ``Golf Digest'' survey of 509 of the nation's 26.5
million golfers, it was determined that 71 percent used oversize
drivers. Of those polled, 89 percent opposed a ban, while 8 percent
were in favor of it. The survey also revealed that 54 percent said
they would stop using the driver if it were banned; 39 percent said
they would ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the USGA's announcement was greeted as a victory
for companies such as PING, Callaway, TaylorMade and Titleist,
which are considered the big four club manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big relief that they didn't draw the line,'' said John
Solheim, president of Phoenix-based Karsten Manufacturing, makers
of PINGs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel there's a cloud about the future because they
haven't defined what they're going to do (with the test).''
</P>
<P>
   But Solheim said it is clear that his company's new PING TiSI
driver, which has not yet been approved by the USGA, is considered
legal.
</P>
<P>
   Fay said the PING TiSI is legal, but he couldn't give a
timetable for the club being approved.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that strict sense, if someone were to win the U.S. Open
with that club, there is not going to be an asterisk applied to
it,'' Fay said.
</P>
<P>
   Ely Callaway, president of the company that makes the popular
Big Bertha drivers, also is relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that the USGA has agreed with us that there is
nothing wrong with the state of the game,'' said Callaway, who went
as far as hiring antitrust lawyer Leonard Decof to litigate a
possible USGA ban.
</P>
<P>
   It was Decof who successfully fought the PGA Tour and USGA when
those organizations tried to ban PING's square-grooved irons from
1989-93. That lawsuit ended with the tour and the USGA having to
pay PING's reported $10 million in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the USGA wanted no part of another possible lawsuit.
But Fay downplayed that fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``With respect to litigation, we have faced this matter before
and that doesn't influence how we go about doing our business,''
Fay said.
</P>
<P>
   There had been other speculation that the golf ball and the
length of the shaft might come under some kind of scrutiny. Fay
said that the USGA is looking at those products, but ``we have
nothing planned on those at this time.'' &QL;

SOSA LEARNS PATIENCE AT PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably the biggest reason the Chicago Cubs are enjoying their
finest season since 1989 is the play of right fielder  &UR; Sammy Sosa,
who hit 16 home runs in a 17-game span that included three on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, consistently among the league leaders in strikeouts, still
is there this season but is showing amazing patience at the plate,
possibly for the first time in his career. He's also hitting the
ball to right field with more consistency.
</P>
<P>
   All these factors have helped Sosa's batting average climb
higher than ever. He still has the home runs and RBIs he normally
has and soon will have to be considered a serious MVP candidate,
especially if the Cubs continue to surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I try to pull the ball, I just go out of control,'' Sosa
said. ``In batting practice, I'm trying to go to right or
right-center.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa used his new hitting philosophy to recently hit home runs
in five consecutive games, tying a franchise record shared by  &UR; Hack
Wilson and  &UR; Ryne Sandberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something for me to be very proud of, being together
with those two guys,'' Sosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie sensation  &UR; Kerry Wood may have instilled much-needed
juice into the pitching staff, but Sosa still makes this club tick.
His big bat in the middle of the lineup remains one of the most
feared in the league. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Always a first &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tampa Bay third baseman  &UR; Wade Boggs, a 17-year veteran, was tossed
from his first game last week after arguing a called third strike
with umpire  &UR; Earl Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I got so upset,'' said Boggs, who went face-to-face
with Cooper for about 90 seconds after the ejection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the fine line a player crosses to get ejected, and I
didn't come close to approaching it. I've never even had an umpire
tell me, `One more word and you're gone.' I know umpires have tough
jobs and I've always respected that. I didn't get over 1,300 walks
without knowing the strike zone.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
On solid ground? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seattle dropped into last place in the American League West last
week, and almost immediately talk started to make the rounds in the
Northwest over the job security of  &UR; Lou Piniella, the only manager
to guide the Mariners into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as soon as the talk started to gain momentum, the biggest
star on the Mariners came to Piniella's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we are is flat,''  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr. said.
``Lou's fine, nobody should even have to consider that. We have
spirit. There's energy on the bench. Everyone is pulling hard for
one another.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella is not the problem with the Mariners' swoon; a lack of
relief pitching is. Of course, acquiring necessary help hasn't been
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see what's going on with the club, and we aren't
satisfied,'' assistant general manager  &UR; Lee Pelekoudas said.
``We're making calls trying to get some things done, but it isn't
easy. Just because you feel a certain player may help you doesn't
mean you can get him.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
The rain man &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Tim Raines quietly became only the fourth player in history to have
800 stolen bases in this century when he stole second base last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Raines, 38, stole his 800th base during a Yankees game in
Montreal, where Raines played 12 years. The only other players with
800 stolen bases are  &UR; Rickey Henderson, Lou Brock and  &UR; Ty Cobb. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Todd Van Remember Me? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pitcher  &UR; Todd Van Poppel finally is putting up the kind of numbers
everyone always thought he was capable of. The celebrated former
first-round pick from the 1990 draft is 5-2 with a 2.65 ERA in his
past 10 starts at Triple-A Oklahoma, a Rangers farm club.
</P>
<P>
   Van Poppel is making a push to return to the major leagues,
where he was supposed to win several Cy Young Awards by now. Van
Poppel, 26, is itching to get back and show he is the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real happy with the way I'm throwing the ball,'' Van
Poppel said. ``I know I've still got some things to work on, but
I'm confident right now I could do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers apparently will call up Van Poppel if the need
arises, which may have occurred with  &UR; Bobby Witt being designated
for assignment. In addition to the formidable record and ERA, Van
Poppel has 66 strikeouts in 82 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, pitchers don't develop until they're 25 or
26,'' Rangers General Manager  &UR; Doug Melvin said. ``You hear scouts
talk about him. They say he's pitching a lot better than they had
seen him previously.'' &QL;

CARDINALS SIGN SEVENTH-ROUND PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - The Cardinals continue to sign their rookies at a
franchise-record pace.
</P>
<P>
   They came to terms with another draft pick on Wednesday when
Colorado wide receiver  &UR; Phil Savoy, one of four seventh-round
selections, reached agreement on a two-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of their 10 draft picks have signed, all but first-round
choice  &UR; Andre Wadsworth, Florida State defensive end;
second-rounder
 &UR; Corey Chavous, Vanderbilt defensive back; and seventh-rounder  &UR; Pat

   Terms of Savoy's deal were not disclosed, but sources close to
the negotiations said he received a package worth about $380,000.
The Cardinals earlier offered Savoy a signing bonus of $24,000,
with annual salaries of $158,000 and $198,000.
</P>
<P>
   Savoy said he would have reached agreement much sooner had his
agent,  &UR; Michael George, not suffered a heart attack shortly after
last April's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty pleased,'' said Savoy, the only wide receiver the
team drafted. ``If I just keep working hard, push myself and stay
focused, I think I've got a chance to make this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals also signed veteran free-agent cornerback  &UR; Dexter
 &UR; Seigler, who played for Amsterdam of the NFL Europe League this
spring. He spent parts of the previous three seasons with the
Seattle Seahawks. &QL;

games last season.
</P>
<P>
   He had just dropped four passes for Alabama-Birmingham against
the University of Memphis and wondered if he should return to
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, he's trying to win a receiving job in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Memphis game, the coach called me to the front of
the bus and said, `Are you sure we made the right move? It's not
too late to move you back,' '' Drake said.
</P>
<P>
   His season changed when he had seven catches for 144 yards the
third game of the season at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a breakthrough game,'' he said. ``Before that, it was
looking like a bad move.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 38 catches for 823 yards (21.7 average) and
seven touchdowns and was chosen second-team All-Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals signed Drake, 6 foot 3, 187 pounds, as an
undrafted free agent, and he's competing for the fifth receiver
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be here,'' he said of Cardinals rookie
camp. &QL;

   Rookie  &UR; Zack Walz left rookie camp last week to attend
graduation ceremonies at Dartmouth.
</P>

   He already was exhausted from a six-hour plane fight. Then, it
started raining during the commencement exercises, and Dartmouth
officials refused to move graduation inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't cancel it unless there is lightning,'' said Walz, a
sixth-round pick who graduated from the Ivy League school with a
degree in government. ``So, we sat out there for four hours in the
rain. I was on the verge of catching pneumonia.''
</P>
<P>
   The bad weather delayed Walz's flight back to the Valley from
Boston. He didn't arrive until 3 a.m. Monday, a few hours before he
had to report to the Cardinals' Tempe training facility for a
meeting. &QL;

   Offensive tackle  &UR; Anthony Clement, one of two second-round
picks, signed a three-year deal worth $1.94 million, including a
$710,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end  &UR; Terry Hardy, a fifth-round pick from Southern
Mississippi, signed a one-year deal worth $195,000. He received a

ATHLETE IS ONLY OVER-50 WOMAN POLE VAULT COMPETI TOR IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Kathy Jager knows what it means to jump for joy.
</P>
<P>
   Jager, who in the last four years has become one of the elite
recreational athletes in the Southwest, recently took on a new
challenge, the pole vault. And as far as anyone can determine,
she's the only woman over age 50 who's competing in the event in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Jager, who will turn 55 on June 26, will try to beat her best
mark of 7 feet, 6 inches this weekend in the Grand Canyon State
Games _ a competition designed to give the recreational athlete a
forum to shine.
</P>
<P>
   And Jager will have many opportunities. In addition to the pole
vault, Jager will participate in nine other events during the
three-day competition.
</P>
<P>
   Why so many, when the majority of weekend warriors would be
content with one or two?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people aren't as crazy as I am,'' said Jager, who is a
home health care nurse.
</P>
<P>
   Opening ceremonies for the sixth annual games begin at 7 p.m.
today at America West Arena, highlighted by the Olympic-style
procession of athletes. Gymnast Kerri Strug and swimmer Gary Hall
Jr., both Olympic gold medalists, will participate in the
festivities, which include music and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight is relaxation time. Friday will be another story for the
athletes, who are expected to number a record 11,000 in 29 events
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jager, used to running herself ragged at meets, is ready. In
previous competitions, she has done as many as six events in one
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part is wondering what shoes I should put on
when,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pole vaulting is a relatively new sport for women, so there was
no way to go but up. And Jager got in on the bottom floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream as a youth was to do something a little more
athletic, but I never got the opportunity,'' she said. ``So when I
was 50, I decided to make this dream happen. I think the second
half of my life is the best part, the chance to live out my dreams.
This is one way of achieving what I have the potential to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you're getting older doesn't mean you can't
achieve your goals and dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   She will be pole-vaulting Friday as the lone female competitor
in her division when the games get under way at Arizona State
University. Jager also will compete in the long jump, high jump,
shot put, discus, javelin, 100-meter run and 200-meter run _ then
she'll hop in pool for the 50-meter breaststroke and 50-meter
freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Jager is used to variety. Raised by her grandparents in St.
Peter, Minn., and influenced by her athletic uncles, she was a
tomboy, living on a farm and climbing trees. In her 30s, she began
playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But she wanted a lot more, both professionally and athletically.
She took care of the job first, going from social work into nursing
14 years ago. When she decided to take the plunge at the Grand
Canyon games five years ago, she was an immediate hit in a number
of events.
</P>
<P>
   But the pole vault represented a unique challenge, and Jager
sees it at more than just jumping.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is not to beat everybody in the pole vault or the
other events,'' she said. ``It's an opportunity to improve and
inspire people to say, `I can do this.'
</P>
<P>
   I've had people come up to me after an event and say that after
watching me they wanted to get back into athletics. You don't have
to just sit and do nothing. You make a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Her current pole vault coach is Todd Lehman, a former vaulter at
Phoenix's North High School and at the University of Southern
California who works out of the Kiss The Sky Track Club at the
Phoenix Swim Club. He has helped her improve by 18 inches in a
matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discourage anyone from vaulting,'' Lehman said. ``It
doesn't matter what age they are. She has fallen on her head a few
times, and as I've told her, no one is immune from ridicule.''
</P>
<P>
   Jager said she almost quit the event, but when she recorded the
7-6 effort, things began to fall into place. Lehman thinks she can
get to 9 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a wall, maybe because I had unrealistic expectations,''
she said. ``I had mental blocks. Todd has helped me put things in
perspective regarding the peaks and valleys.''
</P>
<P>
   A family friend, Bob Bergfeld, who competes in the master
division, got her interested in the pole vault, and he taught her
the basics. She also credits Ed Hedges, track coach at Central High
School in Phoenix, with helping her in the shot put and discus, and
Irwin Jones, coach of the Phoenix Bobcats Track Club, with giving
her tips that has helped cut up to a second off her sprint times.
</P>
<P>
   Since she began competing seriously, she has won a number of
gold medals in state and national competitions in running and
jumping events, and she will participate in a Masters division
national meet in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Jager says she has the full support of her husband, Carl, and
their two children as she balances a work schedule with her five-
to six-day-a-week training regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep a balance,'' she said. ``And I let my husband
carry my bags.'' &QL;

COMING OF AGE  
 DON'T OVERLOOK MIDDLE MEN AT OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five years ago, most of the attention at major
championships centered on foreign players. Guys such as Nick Faldo,
Nick Price, Greg Norman, Bernhard Langer and Jose Maria Olazabal
dominated golf's biggest shows.
</P>
<P>
   That trend, however, shifted dramatically in the past few years
with the emergence of Tiger Woods, Ernie Els, Justin Leonard, David
Duval and Phil Mickelson. Generation X seemingly had arrived, and
the game would never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what? Another notable group of favorites has popped
up this week on the eve of the 98th U.S. Open _ middle-age former
champs. It's as if the game at the professional level has gone back
to the future.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara started it by winning The Masters at age 41. Fred
Couples, 38, recently won his second tournament of the season and
sits on top of the money list with $1,477,017. Even Tom Watson, who
is nearing senior status at age 48, broke through with a victory at
the Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Others in this age group also are playing well. Tom Lehman (39)
always comes to mind, especially at the U.S. Open, where he has
been in contention to win the past three years. Same with Mark
Calcavecchia (38), John Cook (40), Scott Hoch (42) and Scott
Simpson (42), who captured the Open in 1987, the last time it was
played here at the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf ball doesn't know what age you are, which is one of
the great things about this game,'' said O'Meara, whose dramatic
birdie on the final hole at Augusta National earlier this year
edged Couples and Duval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, there are so many great players in the world
right now. A lot has been said about these young guys bursting on
the scene, so it's nice that some of rest of us are getting some
recognition, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than just a fad, O'Meara insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that I've played some of my best golf in the past three
years,'' he added. ``And it's great to see a guy like Tom Watson
regain his putting touch. There are others who also seem to be back
into the chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, for one, simply smiled when asked about the so-called
resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things go in cycles,'' the Scottsdale pro explained. ``Great
players are great players, period, no matter how old you are. I
think it's just one of those things that happened last year _
Justin, Tiger, Davis and Ernie winning the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now this year, if O'Meara, Freddy, myself and Greg Norman win
majors, then suddenly the old guys are back. Well, the old guys
never went anywhere. The young guys just played a little better
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   If age and experience have anything to do with this week's Open,
and there is a strong indication that they might, considering the
conditions at the notoriously tough Olympic Club, one of those
middle-age players just might be holding up the U.S. Open trophy
come Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even Watson, who chuckled after being introduced at his
news conference as a ``possible winner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, `possible winner' from `not a chance' is a big upgrade
for me,'' said Watson, who was the runner-up by a stroke to Simpson
in the '87 Open. ``It helps to win a tournament at my age, and
gives you thoughts of, `Why can't I do this every week?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Watson, whose 33 victories include the 1982 U.S. Open, said that
course management will be at a premium this week because of the
severe rough, which runs as deep as 5 to 7 inches in spots. And he
said that those who have experienced Olympic's subtle, sloping
greens and who keep the ball below the cup, also will have an
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Is he talking about himself?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I like being a favorite,'' he said, laughing at the
thought. ``I am very comfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, view Watson and the rest of the middle-age gang
in a much more serious vein. One of those is Leonard, who seems to
be on everyone's list of favorites, possibly even more so because
of the back problems that recently have plagued Woods and Els, the
defending champ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at anybody as a young guy or an old guy,'' said
Leonard, whose accuracy off the tee fits Olympic virtually to a
``T.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is a sport where, once you're a pro on the PGA Tour, age
is not going to matter. If a player is 40 years old and he's won
out here, has the experience, that's a tremendous advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe that age is not as big a deal as some
people make it out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus, who at age 58 will be competing in his 41st
straight Open, concurs. Of more importance, the winner of five
national championships said, is how the sponsoring U.S. Golf
Association sets up the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tom (Watson) will play very well here, just like he
did in '87,'' Nicklaus said. ``He's not too old, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``And considering the nature of the course, I think that anyone
who has played here before on these tight fairways and hills will
definitely have a tremendous advantage over those who have not.''
</P>
<P>
   Does that list include the Golden Bear? Can he still compete
with the likes of Els, Woods, Leonard, Duval and Mickelson?
</P>
<P>
   ``They better play well,'' he said with a wink before bursting
out in laughter.

INVESTMENT IN PREDATORS PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Will Meris' office in Scottsdale is decorated with
Orlando Predators memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a second. This is Arizona. The Rattlers play here. Nobody
is seen wearing a Predators shirt in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Meris is not only the youngest owner in football at age 32, but
one of the most unusual. While his team works out about 2,100 miles
away, Meris runs an investment fund in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Some in sports probably wished their owner kept that kind of
distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not as much a hands-on owner as a lot of guys in this
league, which is kind of good,'' first-year Predators Coach Jay
Gruden said. ``He lets us handle the football side of it. He lets
people in the front office do their things. But if he sees changes
need to be made, he'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meris, a 1984 Scottsdale Chaparral High School graduate who
spent most of his time on a tennis court, always is on the lookout
for new challenges. The former stockbroker found one in 1992 when
he attended the Rattlers' first game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what Arena football was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meris, sitting in the front row with a friend, caught a
misguided player in his lap. Five years later, he owned a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept thinking Arena football has so much excitement, I
wanted to get involved,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see something in the local market that is working, you
go for it. That is what I saw in the Rattlers. No one in the
country knows what Arena football is where there is not an Arena
football team. Where there is Arena football, everyone loves it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Predators didn't fall into Meris' lap as easily as an Arena
football player. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Meris said he had heard that the Predators, whom he watched on
TV lose to the Rattlers in the 1994 title game, were for sale at
the end of the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   He said the hard part was getting a meeting with the owner, Don
Dizney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to meet with the previous owner's attorneys for two
hours to make sure I was for real, to see if they would let me meet
with him,'' Meris said.
</P>
<P>
   He got the meeting and, 24 hours later, a deal was hammered out,
with Meris paying $2.3 million for the team that originally was
bought at $120,000. At the time, Meris was laughed at for paying
such a high price. It was the most ever spent on an Arena team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Meris is laughing. Last year, the asking price for an Arena
team was $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In December '96, Meris sold 40 percent of the club to the
public, making it the only publicly traded Arena football team.
Orlando Predators Entertainment Inc. is listed on the Nasdaq market
under the ticker symbol PRED.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, it's done well with them,'' said Jerry
Trice, vice president of football operations for the Arena Football
League. ``They seem to be satisfied. We have other owners watching
it closely to see if that's something they might want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meris didn't stop there. With money from the public offering and
raising more on his own, he invested in Gridiron, which is the
Arena patent, for future returns from the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exciting,'' Meris said. ``This is the reason why I got
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this league gets the big revenue and the NFL comes in like
they're talking about, the Predators will get triple shares
compared to the other teams. All national revenues get divided
between the 16 teams. We'd get three times. We paid through the
league an undisclosed amount of money for that right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meris, who rents a house in Orlando, joins the team for every
game. He won't have to go far this week. The Predators (4-3) play
the Rattlers (6-1) at America West Arena on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meris said he has used the Rattlers as a marketing model and
still roots for them _ but only when they're not playing the
Predators.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators are at the top of the league in attendance with
the Rattlers. Meris also knows where the money is made in the
league: concessions. When the Predators signed a new lease with
Orlando Arena this year, he made sure that they got 20 percent of
the concessions. Arena fans in Orlando love beer, Meris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high risk,'' Meris said of his investment. ``I was aware
I was spending money that could be risky. All the research I did,
though, I felt this league would continue to grow.'' &QL;

WESTPHAL'S PATIENCE PAYS OFF IN PLUM JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - When Danny Ainge was introduced as the future coach of
the Suns a couple of years ago, he said he probably would resemble
Paul Westphal more than any of his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   That caused more than a few jaws to drop, considering the Suns
had just fired Westphal the season before.
</P>
<P>
   But Ainge says he saw patience, integrity and perspective from
Westphal during the three seasons he played for him. And of those
virtues, apparently patience was the most valuable.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two years out of the NBA, Westphal was named
Wednesday to replace George Karl as coach of the Seattle
SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for Paul,'' Ainge said. ``It's obviously a great
coaching opportunity. His patience paid off, and he's getting a
chance to coach a team that's been winning 60 games a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's equal to the situation he came into the first time around
(when the Suns won 62 games in Westphal's first year).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a great nucleus in Gary Payton, Vin Baker and Detlef
Schrempf. That's a pretty impressive nucleus, and they're young,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Westphal's name has surfaced in coaching searches over the past
two seasons, but in each instance he was not hired or turned the
jobs down. The Suns paid Westphal for two years after he was fired,
which gave him the luxury of waiting.
</P>
<P>
   But there also were accusations, specifically from Houston's
Charles Barkley who played for the Suns when Westphal was fired,
that Westphal had been blackballed.
</P>
<P>
   Ainge believes Westphal was simply biding his time for the right
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't trying to go for just any job, like some coaches out
there,'' Ainge said. ``It worked out well for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo said the Suns organization
was queried about Westphal by other teams on previous occasions,
and during the SuperSonics' coaching search. He said the club was
never anything but honest and supportive about Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, let's address Charles for a moment,'' Colangelo
said of Barkley. ``Charles will say whatever is to his benefit at
the time, so take that with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we were asked, we gave supportive and candid answers
as it relates to Paul's abilities as a coach. I know that several
people in this organization were questioned by Seattle. The same
answers were given to Seattle that were given to others who
inquired during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an organization, we're pleased for Paul. And as an
individual, I'm very happy for him _ not only because he's back,
but because he's got a terrific opportunity in Seattle. That's a
well-respected organization that has enough talent to be a title
contender.'' &QL;

ASU'S KEALY CLEARED FOR SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Ryan Kealy has received complete clearance from
his doctors and will be at full strength when Arizona State begins
preseason drills in August, the quarterback said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy is ahead of his rehabilitation schedule. He underwent
surgery in December after suffering a torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his right knee during ASU's regular-season finale
against Arizona. The initial concern was that he might not be ready
for the start of Camp Tontozona on Aug. 12, but Sun Devils Coach
Bruce Snyder said Kealy's rehabilitation ``went perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm full speed and fully recovered at this point,'' Kealy
said. ``The only thing that needs to be done is just to get out and
do some of the things I couldn't this spring, rollling out, stuff
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy said he has been running and lifting weights and is up to
200 pounds, 10 more than last season. He hopes to add another 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get bigger, just to sustain some of those hits,'' he
said. ``I was a little bit beat up at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy set ASU freshman records for completions, attempts, yards
and touchdowns in 1997 and led the Sun Devils to a 9-3 record. In
his last six regular-season games, he completed 94 of 169 passes
for 1,264 yards and 11 touchdowns with only three interceptions. He
passed for 2,137 yards overall.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Mary's High School standout suffered a torn ACL in his
left knee after his prep career ended and rehabilitated it during
the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (rehabilitation) wasn't so bad, I guess because I've gone
through it before,'' he said. ``The strengthening process wasn't
new to me and it really helped out this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said Kealy is ``good to go.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's stronger. He has confidence in the knee and he's throwing
the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy's successful freshman season is one reason the Sun Devils
are ranked in the top 10 in several preseason polls. This season's
national championship game will be played at the Fiesta Bowl.
Coincidentally, Kealy is interning in the Fiesta Bowl's Tempe
headquarters for the second straight summer.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy said he's trying not to get caught up in the hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think rankings really matter to us at this point,'' he
said. ``It's flattering, but we can't take it for anything that
it's not. We've got to go out there, do the hard work and earn our
position.'' &QL;

AMPUTEE FELT RELIEF AND EXHAUSTION AT EVEREST SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Tom Whittaker dragged his exhausted body and his
artificial foot the last few feet to the summit of Mt. Everest.
Then he flopped over onto the Tibetan side of the world's highest
peak, out of the wind.
</P>
<P>
   At 6:30 a.m. on May 27, the Prescott College professor became
the first amputee to climb Everest, but he was too spent to
celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling was definitely one of relief,'' Whittaker, 49,
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   And of continuing danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're also very cognizant of where you are,'' he said, ``and
that you're out on a limb.''
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker knew the math: For every 3.5 people who reach the
summit of Everest, one dies. And sometimes they die on the descent.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker and his group _ CBS cameraman Jeff Rhoads and four
Sherpa guides _ made the descent in good order, but the extreme
toll that the climb made on their bodies made it possible to enjoy
the feat only in retrospect.
</P>
<P>
   Normally after a climb like this, Whittaker said, he would be
thin and wasted. But after bulking up to 205 pounds before the
ascent, he's dropped to 185 pounds on his 6-foot-3 frame, just five
pounds under his normal weight. Whittaker said he was aided by
supplements supplied by Inter-Cal Corp. of Prescott, sponsor of the
expedition.
</P>
<P>
   He also credited the lightness and utility of his artificial
foot, developed by Flex-Foot, which cut the weight of the prothesis
from 7 pounds to 2.5 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker said the artificial right foot had both disadvantages
and advantages over a real foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you're driving a tin foot, you're putting out more
energy,'' Whittaker said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the foot can't be manipulated at angles, which
makes descents more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   However, Whittaker said, the artificial foot is a plus for
traversing ice because the climber can dig in the front points of
his crampon and lean into the foot without putting strain on the
Achilles tendon and calf muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Whittaker became a professor of adventure education at Prescott
College in 1995, teaching such activities as climbing, kayaking and
river-rafting.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, he had been living with his disability for more
than 15 years. He lost most of his right foot and his right kneecap
in 1979 in a car crash, shortly after he completed a master's
degree at Idaho State University.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his disability, Whittaker set a goal of climbing
Everest. He failed in 1989 after he lost an artificial foot in a
violent storm on the mountain that blew away most of his gear. He
tried again in 1995, but storms again frustrated him.
</P>
<P>
   His successful expedition was also plagued with danger. Just a
week before he made the summit, he extricated from a crevasse a
climber who had broken several ribs in a 250-foot fall.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that exhausting rescue, he developed pulmonary
edema _ swelling of the heart _ and was forced to go partway back
down Everest to seek medical help.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Whittaker was modest about his success and eager
to cite the triumphs of others such as Rhoads, who reached the
summit twice in a week, the first non-Sherpa to complete the climb
twice in a single season.
</P>
<P>
   Before Whittaker made the climb, he was determined to show other
disabled people what someone with a damaged body could accomplish.
On Wednesday, however, he said he didn't mean to preach to disabled
people about what they should or should not do; he just wanted to
see them live their lives in a positive way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we let other people define who we (disabled people) are as
a population,'' Whittaker said, ``we'll always live under a
shadow.'' &QL;

SENATE EXTINGUISHES SNUFFS SEN. JOHN MCCAIN'S ANTI-SMOKING BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senate snuffed out Sen. John McCain's sweeping anti-smoking
bill Wednesday, giving Big Tobacco a major victory in its epic
battle with the Arizona lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's $40 million national advertising campaign against
McCain and his tough-on-tobacco legislation proved to be a ``very
wise investment,'' the senator said, because ``they won.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The losers are the children of America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, though, predicted that, ``when the American
people understand fully what is going on, they won't like what they
see.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This battle is far from over,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   After four weeks of intense haggling, the Republican-controlled
Senate on Wednesday shot down two attempts by McCain and his allies
to gain the 60 votes needed to keep the measure alive. Arizona's
other senator, Republican Jon Kyl, split with McCain, effectively
voting to kill the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Kyl said McCain's bill would have
resulted in a ``huge regressive tax increase'' that ``would have
created a huge black market for cigarettes.``
</P>
<P>
   Democrats vowed to bring the bill back to the Senate floor and
attacked their Republican colleagues as servants of Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this bill goes down today, Joe Camel wins and our kids
lose,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi countered for
Republicans who argued that the measure had become a big-government
``tax and spend'' bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've lost sight of the original noble cause of just dealing
with teenage smoking and drug abuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sen. Phil Gramm said the public saw through McCain's bill
and concluded it was a massive tax increase on blue-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, it looked like everyone in the world was for
this bill . . . but yet when you got outside Washington, back in
America, the public either was totally (uninterested) in this issue
or they were against,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in the end, the American people knew more than we knew. And
as a result, for the good of the nation, this bill is going to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said he would try to revive
some form of tobacco legislation, a bill ``that is narrowly focused
on teen smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to reduce teen smoking, not increase taxes,''
Gingrich said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also reminded reporters the ``issue is not gone'' because
the state attorneys general, including Arizona's Grant Woods, are
pursuing the tobacco companies in court.
</P>
<P>
   Woods said that as a result of Wednesday's Senate vote, ``We'll
have to take a serious look at going our own way, state by state,
on this, if that's what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you the attorneys general across this country are
committed to the issue and will continue to fight the tobacco
industries in the courtroom,'' Woods told ``The Republic.''
Arizona's lawsuit against the industry is scheduled to go to trial
in March.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wednesday's vote represented a big victory for the
tobacco industry, which had spent millions on radio and TV
commercials and full-page ads in major newspapers, including ``The
Republic,'' attacking McCain's bill.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco chief Steven Goldstone even flew to Phoenix in late
May to blast McCain's bill in a speech to a local Kiwanis club. The
move personalized the industry's crusade against the senator.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco vendors across the state also mobilized against McCain,
flooding the senator's office with letters and postcards provided
by the Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Samuelson, manager of a Phoenix Cigarettes Cheaper! store,
said one of her customers relayed the news of the bill's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dead in the water!'' Samuelson exclaimed. ``We put too
much pressure on them.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain conceded the advertising blitz had a significant effect
on the debate. Before the tobacco industry's ad campaign began, he
said, the Senate Commerce Committee had approved the bill 19-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's clearly been a change,'' McCain said. ``The
only conclusion one can draw is, the tobacco companies' advertising
campaign has had a significant effect on their constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain predicted the vote could come back to haunt those
senators who voted against the bill in November.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl is not up for re-election until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I would not like to go into this next election
having been responsible for killing a way to address the fact that
3,000 kids start smoking every day and 1,000 of them will die
early,'' McCain told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the measure would raise the price of a pack of
cigarettes by $1.10 a pack over five years. The money would go to
help states pay their smoking-related health care costs, finance an
anti-smoking advertising campaign and pay for health research.
</P>
<P>
   At the insistence of Republicans, the measure also was expanded
to include an election-year tax cut for couples making less than
$50,000, a series of anti-drug provisions and a cap on fees for
lawyers who participated in lawsuits against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Democrats, backed by public-health groups,
sought to frame the debate as a question of choosing children over
cigarettemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to teenage messengers who customarily sit at the foot
of the Senate rostrum, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said their peer
group would be targets for tobacco marketing. The industry, he said
would ``consciously attempt to addict them to nicotine.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the truth was different, that they, too, favor
cracking down on teen smoking, but that the bill had gotten out of
hand. &QL;

ALOHA SHIRT HAD MODEST START

   The Hawaiian shirt came into being after island missionaries
encouraged the natives to cover their nakedness, H. Thomas Steele
writes in the book ``The Hawaiian Shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Hawaiians utilized traditional Polynesian
designs and native tapa _ or bark cloth _ for their shirts. Designs
and motifs were hand-painted or stenciled from hand-carved wood
cuts. Shirts were often one of a kind.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the patterns were more geometric and less floral,
Steele writes. By the 1920s, small island tailor shops were making
custom prints for Hawaiian families for special occasions, such as
weddings.
</P>
<P>
   When tourism came to Hawaii in the late 1920s, the Hawaiian
shirt literally became a blank canvas for local artists. Designs
depicting everything from romantic beaches and erupting volcanoes
to tropical flowers and local legend began to appear.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until 1936 that a shirtmaker named Ellery J. Chun
coined the term ``Aloha'' shirt.
</P>
<P>
   The expression stuck. Today, Aloha shirts are considered
American folk art. The older shirts are collector's items. &QL;

LAWYER FOR DEFENDANT IN RACIAL BEATING CASE STILL UNCHOSEN
</HEADLINE>

   RIVERHEAD, N.Y _ ``The prosecution is doing everything it can to
keep me from having a fair retrial,'' Austin Offen said Wednesday
after a court hearing that left still undecided the question of who
would represent him at his retrial on attempted murder charges.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Despite the legal risks of acting as his own lawyer, Offen
continued to insist on defending himself if necessary, and the
court delayed its plan of naming a new lawyer from the Legal Aid
Society of Suffolk County after a society representative raised the
possibility of a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Offen, whose first trial in the beating of a young black man
during a 1996 brawl outside a Westhampton Beach nightclub ended in
a hung jury on April 8, said during a telephone interview from the
Suffolk County jail, ``It's my right to pick my own lawyer, but the
district attorney's office is forcing the judge to pick someone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first trial ended, his lawyer, Bruce Barket, told the
court that Offen was broke, owed him more than $73,000 in legal
fees and had no way to pay him. However, Barket told the court, he
could continue to represent Offen if the judge would dismiss him as
his private lawyer, then reappoint him as a Legal Aid lawyer, paid
with state funds set aside for indigent defendants.
</P>
<P>
   As a Legal Aid lawyer, Barket would receive a standard fee of
$40 an hour during court time; his regular fee is $225 an hour in
court, plus the cost of investigators and expert witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Joel Lefkowitz of Suffolk County Criminal Court,
dismissed Barket but refused to reassign him. Instead, he turned
the matter over to the Legal Aid Society of Suffolk County and
suggested that it appoint another lawyer, Steven Wilutis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've refused to meet with anyone from Legal Aid because I want
Barket,'' Offen said during the telephone interview. ``He's been
with me for two years and now the judge and the D.A. want to get
rid of him.''
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has charged that Offen, 27, who is white,
attacked Shane Daniels, 23, who is black, with a metal club during
a racially motivated brawl outside a nightclub on May 26, 1996.
Offen has denied the charges. Daniels' severe head injuries have
left him with no memory of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   During a hearing before Lefkowitz, Offen was permitted to speak
briefly on the selection of a lawyer, but only after the judge
cautioned him against representing himself.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Stephen O'Brien, who has opposed reappointing
Barket, said it was the view of the district attorney's office that
if a defendant could not pay for a lawyer, it was up to the judge
to appoint one. ``If taxpayers are paying the bill, then the
defendant no longer has the right to pick and choose,'' O'Brien
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilutis, who was in the courtroom, said afterward that he had
not met or spoken with Offen.
</P>
<P>
   James Miller, a lawyer representing the Legal Aid Society, told
the judge that since Legal Aid lawyers had represented three of the
witnesses in Offen's first trial, conflict of interest might
prevent naming a new Legal Aid lawyer for the retrial. That
objection would not prevent reappointing Barket as a Legal Aid
lawyer, though.

STUDY SAYS GAMBLING BEST FOR GOVERNORS ISLAND
</HEADLINE>
 ISLAND-NYT   (dc) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A new study commissioned by the mayor's office to
look at the future of Governors Island has concluded that a
high-class gambling casino would provide the most revenue of any
development option being considered _ more than enough to meet the
expense of preserving the historic northern part of the island.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the consulting firm of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand showed
that a casino could generate as much as $57.5 million a year, more
than three times as much money as the combination of a hotel and
conference center with residential development. Other uses
generated even less.
</P>
<P>
   The island in New York Harbor, which is owned by the federal
government, contains a number of historic buildings and offers
stunning views of lower Manhattan, but it has been largely deserted
since the Coast Guard shut down its operations there almost a year
ago. President Clinton offered to turn the site over to New York
provided the city and state could come up with a redevelopment plan
that would benefit the public.
</P>
<P>
   Parks advocates, preservationists and some politicians have
urged the city to come up with proposals, fearing that otherwise
the government might sell the island to the highest bidder. But the
mayor has repeatedly said the city could not afford the cost of
restoring and maintaining the historic buildings unless the
development plan generated significant revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said the city's major concern was to
avoid ``hundreds of millions of dollars of liability'' if it
accepts the president's offer. ``The purpose of this is to put some
reality into a dream that has been largely unreal,'' Giuliani said.
``Preliminary to doing something useful with Governors Island is
knowing how much it will cost. It will cost a huge amount of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambling could be the source of that money. A separate study
also released Wednesday by the investment firm of Bear Stearns &AMP;
Co., which was conducted independent of the city's study, estimated
that a casino on Governors Island would attract 5.7 million
visitors a year and generate $340 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   But several hurdles must be removed before anyone pulls a slot
machine lever there. Gambling is still illegal in New York state,
and to change the law, two separate legislative sessions must pass
an amendment to the state constitution and voters in New York City
must vote in a referendum. In Washington, city legislators worried
that President Clinton or Congress might retract the offer to New
York if casino gambling was in the island's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong contingent in Congress that hates
gambling,'' said Rep. Carolyn Maloney.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler said, ``As long as the mayor keeps talking
casino, he's stopping the process.''
</P>
<P>
   These two representatives are sponsoring a bill to set up a
special commission composed of federal, state and city appointees
to address the island's future.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Levine said that the city was still
interested in other options, and would soon request ideas from
housing and commercial developers, as well as casinos. He said that
on Monday, a group from Tivoli Gardens, the Copenhagen amusement
park, visited the island.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the city estimates the annual cost of maintaining
the island at more than $40 million. In addition, he released a
report on public works improvements prepared by the consulting firm
of Frederic R. Harris Inc. for Turner Construction Co. under a city
contract. It showed that the cost of improvements to roads,
utilities and piers, among other things, would range from $20.5
million to $45.3 million, depending on the option chosen.
</P>
<P>
   This study concerned, as did the analysis of economic benefits,
only the 25 southernmost acres on the island, which were built on
landfill from the Lexington Avenue subway. Neither study involuded
any acquisition costs, though Giuliani said he feared that a
budget-conscious Republican Congress would never allow Clinton's $1
offer to become law _ particularly when existing legislation
mandates its sale for $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling projection includes 100,000 square feet of gambling
space; a 1,000-room hotel; 2,200 gambling positions, including
1,500 slot machines and 120 tables, and a luxury spa and health
club. A 24-hour ferry service was assumed. In addition, the study
suggested that other residential and commercial possibilities could
coexist with the casino, adding to the economic benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to gambling remains strong in New York state,
however, cutting across class, ideology and religion. Nadler
suggested some of the basis for the antigambling sentiment when he
asked if the city considered noneconomic factors in its study.
``Did they factor in the costs of additional child abandonment,
divorces and bankruptcies?'' he asked. ``Those things always
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Others also faulted the city for not taking more factors into
account. Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks
Conservancy, which has urged more open dialogue about Governors
Island, said the city's study raised more questions than it
answered. ``Will we even get gambling?'' she asked. ``How long is
it going to take? What happens to the island in the interim?''
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor seemed persuaded on the economics of gambling for
Governors Island, though he acknowledged that political
difficulties remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are probably are other attractions,'' he said. ``The one
that works on paper is gaming.''

MARTIN STONE, 83, RADIO PIONEER AND PRODUCER OF `HOWDY DOODY'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Martin Stone, a longtime broadcasting executive and
entertainment lawyer who was the producer of ``Howdy Doody'' and
the founder of a suburban radio network, died on June 7 in
Washington, where he was attending the graduation of a grandchild.
He was 83 and lived in Pound Ridge, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone owned WVIP in Mount Kisco, N.Y., which he founded in 1957.
He was forced to close the station last year, however, after a fire
gutted the seashell-shaped building that housed it.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s and early 50s, Stone produced ``Howdy Doody''
at NBC and ``Author Meets the Critics,'' a book-discussion program
that ran for six years variously on NBC, ABC and the old Dumont
network.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, he helped establish a group of suburban AM
and FM stations in New York under the Herald Tribune Radio Network,
said William O'Shaughnessy, president of Whitney Radio in New
Rochelle, N.Y. The group included WVIP, WVOX in New Rochelle, WFYI
on Long Island and WGHQ in Kingston, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Under Stone's leadership, suburban radio stations began to offer
more variety, from local news to big-band music, from local
political debates to announcements of school closings. ``He was a
pioneer in radio and TV,'' O'Shaughnessy said. ``He taught us that
radio could aspire to be more than a jukebox, that it achieves its
highest calling when it is a platform for many different
viewpoints.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer by training, Stone worked in the 1940s on the
Lend-Lease Act, under which Britain was permitted to use American
armaments during World War II, and the G.I. Bill of Rights. In
later years, he worked as an entertainment lawyer, whose clients
included Jackie Robinson, Howard Cosell, Merv Griffin and the actor
Gabby Hayes, O'Shaughnessy said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, Stone was an unofficial adviser to President Harry S.
Truman, who was reviewing his post-presidential employment
possibilities. Stone produced three television appearances Truman
made for the Ford Foundation soon after he left office.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was the head of the industrial division of the 1964
World's Fair in New York. In recent years, he was a director of the
New 42d Street Development Corp., a nonprofit organization involved
in the revitalization of Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Stone was born in Brooklyn and attended Bard College and Yale
Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's first wife, Lyndel, a painter, died in 1967. He is
survived by his wife, Antje Schwecke; a son, Richard, of Rhinebeck,
N.Y.; a daughter, Judith Ain of Washington; a brother, Allan, of
Great Neck, N.Y.; and four grandchildren.

<P>
   Astros receive &QL; 
new lease on life
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
AT one point during Wednesday's news conference to announce the
almost-in-blood commitment by the Astros to spend the next 30 years
occupying the (advertise here) Ballpark at Union Station, a series
of loud roars wafted in from the Astrodome playing field. For what
was a very sweet moment, it seemed a fitting response but also a
tad ironic.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the crowd was saluting the visiting Hercules, not one
of the local heroes. And later, when Mark McGwire jacked home run
No. 32 over the left-field scoreboard in the third inning, he
received a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, though. Applause is applause. Noise is noise.
Baseball is coming alive in Houston again, and if Mark McGwire can
contribute, then hooray for him.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, now 43-27 after a most memorable ninth-inning rally,
are having a stellar year on the field, and it's beginning to be
aptly mirrored at the turnstiles. That hole in the ground downtown
holds grand promise of better times to come, even a new era of
profitability for a franchise that two years ago had Virginia on
its mind.
</P>
<P>
   If team sources are to be believed _ the venerable Tal Smith
being one of them _ the losses incurred by Drayton McLane Jr. since
he bought the team six summers ago are closing in on $100 million.
The new park, while ahead of its construction schedule because of
the favorable dry weather, is still a season and a half from
completion, meaning the bleeding must continue for the near term.
</P>
<P>
   Red ink will flow for a while
</P>
<P>
   Smith said there's nothing the Astros can do this year, winning
the World Series included, to finish in the black. But the deal
they have cut _ finally _ with the Houston Sports Authority, those
civic-minded gents assigned to protect the city's and the county's
interests, affords McLane a fighting chance to operate a more
economically viable enterprise in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a free ride. Although McLane won't have to put any
money into erecting the structure, as was originally the plan, he
will have to pay $7.1 million per year in rent, royalties and
maintenance. That sounds high, but in return he can use the stadium
as he sees fit while pocketing every dollar squeezable from the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The only expressly excluded enterprises are those defined as
being industrial, toxic or sexually oriented. Regarding the last, I
assume that means his ushers, male and female, will have to remain
fully clothed while on duty.
</P>
<P>
   Drayton gets the luxury-box income. He gets the concessions. He
gets the naming rights, too. He can also cover the outfield fence
with signs, as he has done at the Dome, and make a little extra
jingle there. While the Astros will never be a cash cow, they'll do
OK as long as baseball itself can fight off further suicidal
tendencies. Eventually, he'll make up his losses and perhaps one
day conclude that having taken the plunge into professional sports
was an absolutely smashing idea.
</P>
<P>
   McLane's lone out regarding the lease, which covers three
decades with options for an extra one in two five-year increments,
appears to be a successful bankruptcy petition. And he can't go
bankrupt playing at the ballpark. No chance. Downtown ball is a
happenin' thing these days. Why should Houston be any different?
</P>
<P>
   De facto dignitary on hand
</P>
<P>
   Smith called the stadium ``absolutely essential'' to the
survival of the Astros in Houston. He called Wednesday one of most
significant days in franchise history, much of which he has been
personally a part of. It was a big enough day for baseball's
permanent acting commissioner, Bud Selig, to come down from
Milwaukee and lend his support, to both the project and Houston's
place in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Selig is a stadium buff himself. The Brewers are getting a new
one, too, you know.
</P>
<P>
   During the proceedings, which culminated in a formal
lease-signing at home plate made all the more special by the 6-5
victory that fell from the sky three hours hence, lots of folks
accepted kudos for helping make Drayton's dream a reality. Granted,
a smattering of them were the same people who once fought the
project vigorously, but I won't name names.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is it got done, and it's going to get finished
on time and on budget. As Sports Authority chairman Jack Rains
noted, there's no ``wiggle room'' _ other than the $10 million
that's already built into the price.
</P>
<P>
   Which, Rains said, is ``$229 million, down from $278 million.''
The two numbers are apples and oranges, however, seeing as how the
latter included architectural fees and the like, whereas the former
is only the steel, bricks and mortar. The real, all-inclusive sum
is $243 million, still quite the bargain compared to what most
publicly subsidized playpens go for in the late 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   So those early cheers were perfectly timed, even if they were
for one of the bad guys.
</P>

U.S. left looking 
for new direction
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ The steps were small, and the wait was long, but when
the United States arrived at the 1998 World Cup, it finally brought
a team that looked worldly and seemed refined, with proven
professional players wise to the ways of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks later, the Americans' adventure to France is
beginning to look like National Lampoon's European Vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Which way to the Louvre? Where's McDonald's? Are we on the right
train?
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are looking lost and panicked, all but decked out
in Bermuda shorts, Hawaiian shirts and knee-high black socks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourists'' is how veteran midfielder Tab Ramos put this
gone-askew expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a 2-0 undressing by Germany, the U.S. team suddenly
seems out of its element, with coach Steve Sampson thrown into the
role of the bumbling leader telling everyone that things will be
all right but having a hard time sounding convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may as well pack our bags right now if we don't change
things quickly,'' U.S. forward Eric Wynalda said. ``We'll lose to
Iran, and that will be it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the pivotal game with Iran on Sunday fast approaches, U.S.
players are roundly questioning Sampson's strategies and
techniques, particularly his starting lineup for Monday's
opening-game loss to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to believe when you looked down our bench (against
Germany) and there was Marcelo Balboa, Alexi Lalas and all the
experience just sitting there,'' said Ramos, a well-decorated
veteran who has been among Sampson's most vocal critics and also
sat on the bench Monday. ``It's the coach's decision. You don't
have to agree with him. And I don't. We should have had more
experience out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the 2-0 loss, Sampson's strategies and motivation
techniques had seemed to work wonders for this U.S. team. They
seemed to keep players happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson was being called creative and ingenious. Players
applauded his efforts, publicly embracing his midfielder-heavy
philosophy, which promoted speed and counterattacks but left little
room for veterans such as Lalas.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sampson's controversial move to cut veteran captain John
Harkes from the squad weeks before the tournament caused only a few
ripples within the team, as the quarterbacking reins were handed
over to talented 24-year-old Claudio Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   And when Sampson introduced one of his more unique motivational
drills during training camp, instructing players to stand in a
circle on the soccer field and hold hands while telling their
teammates a ``word of the day,'' everyone participated.
</P>
<P>
   Then once in France, Sampson tried to keep the family atmosphere
going by isolating the team at a luxurious chateau in the French
countryside and limiting exposure to the bright lights and buzz of
Paris and the World Cup as the tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   But now, after the sluggish loss to the powerful and veteran
German team against which Sampson surprised many by benching Lalas,
Balboa, Roy Wegerle and especially Ramos, U.S. players are shaking
their heads in discontent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were isolated in the middle of France, then plopped down in
Paris where it's like a circus,'' said Lalas. ``The (young players)
didn't know what to think. They didn't have the experience to deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany started seven players in Monday's game who had
participated in at least two World Cup tournaments. Three German
players had been in at least three Cup tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   The United States started seven players taking part in their
first World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, who before the game had been called dinosaurs in
the German press, started only three players younger than 31. For
the United States, all but one starter _ defender Thomas Dooley _
were younger than 30.
</P>
<P>
   The drastic gap in experience was clear from the opening kick,
with 33-year-old German star Juergen Klinsmann perfectly executing
an assist to 31-year-old Andy Moller for Germany's first goal.
Then, it was Klinsmann, a veteran of four World Cup tournaments,
icing the victory with a marvelous quick catch and goal midway
through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out there with the wrong attitude. We went out there
timid, which is to be expected from guys who haven't been there
before,'' said Wynalda, the starting forward who did not get a
single shot on goal in the Germany game.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Wynalda's problem was he never got the ball and the
German defense squeezed the inexperienced outside midfielders.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna played a solid game in the middle for the United States,
but few opportunities could develop against the German defense and
Reyna fell victim to one of the more physical poundings he ever has
taken.
</P>
<P>
   The German scouting report clearly said to take the ball away
from Reyna by any means possible, and that's what happened. Reyna
had bumps and scrapes all over his body after the final whistle.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the U.S. bench as the poor outing was unfolding were
Lalas, Balboa, Ramos, Wegerle and Jeff Agoos, who have participated
in more than 400 international matches combined over the years and
have handled physical international play for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way to prepare people for the World Cup,'' Ramos
said. ``You have to live through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos is one U.S. player who has done just that.
</P>
<P>
   He was around at Italia '90, when a young and overmatched
American team managed to qualify for the World Cup for the first
time in 40 years. Ramos also was around four years ago for USA '94.
</P>
<P>
   Balboa also played for the U.S. World Cup teams in 1990 and
1994. And Lalas and Wegerle played in every game four years ago at
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But all four watched from the bench Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys played really hard and did some good things, but it
looked like we'd gone backward,'' Ramos said. ``We looked more like
our '90 team than our '94 team. That's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyna even admitted that he was surprised at Sampson's decision
to leave such experience on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   And Sampson, who already has said that Ramos will start in
Sunday's game against Iran, also hinted at injecting more
experience into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have had a psychological problem more than a physical
problem against Germany,'' Sampson said. ``We have to find a way to
get some more experience onto the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Ramos, Sampson also may start Balboa against Iran,
while getting Lalas and quick-striking veteran Preki Radosavljevic
some time on the field.
</P>
<P>
   He also likely will sub in Wegerle. And considering the
impressive outing by Frankie Hejduk, a youngster at 23 who nearly
headed in a goal for the United States, he should get the start in
front of Mike Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put a team on the field that will go forward
against Iran, something we didn't do a very good job of against
Germany,'' Reyna said. ``We have to get more chances. We need to
pretty much do everything better against Iran than we did against
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of advancing to the next round, a victory against Iran
on Sunday is vital.
</P>
<P>
   The final U.S. opponent in the Group F round-robin stage of the
tournament is a tough Yugoslavian team. If the Americans could
defeat Iran, earning three points, they could go into the final
game with a clear shot at advancing with either a tie or a win
against Yugoslavia, depending on what happens in Sunday's
Germany-Yugoslavia game.
</P>
<P>
   But if the same confusing lineups and performances lead to a
U.S. loss against Iran in Lyon on Sunday, then all hopes of
advancing would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in 1990, we were tourists, basically,'' Ramos said. ``We
knew we were lucky just to be in Italy. But we're much better than
that now. We need to show people that we are. We have to play
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Or else this European vacation will be over.

Italy finds `A' game in Group B victory
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vieri scores twice in shutout of Cameroon
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ It might not have been quite the overwhelming show put
on display one night earlier by their traditional World Cup rival
and 1994 final opponent, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Vieri, Vieri close.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's Christian Vieri, a 24-year-old star in the making with a
game as flowing as his thick locks of hair, hammered home two goals
in Montpellier as the Azzurri came back from a mediocre opener to
defeat Cameroon 3-0 Wednesday and take control of the Cup's Group
B.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone performed well, they worked hard, and the attackers
did extremely well,'' Italy coach Cesare Maldini said. ``We had a
lot of chances and converted many of those chances that came our
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was the first victory by any team in Group B, after
Italy had to feel lucky escaping with a last-minute 2-2 tie against
Chile in a sluggish Cup-opening game last week. Also in the group,
Cameroon and Austria tied last week, while earlier Wednesday
Austria pulled out a last-second tie with Chile.
</P>
<P>
   What the victory means for Italy, then, is that it is all but
guaranteed a spot in the second round, although Italy likely hopes
to finish first in the group so it can avoid Brazil in the round of
16.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from Italy's opener last week, when a controversial call
and Roberto Baggio's late penalty kick were the only reasons Italy
pulled out the tie, winning the group might have seemed unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But on Wednesday, with Baggio again playing a critical role in
setting up Luigi Di Biagio's eighth-minute goal with a beautiful
assist and Vieri scoring his Cup-leading third goal of the
tournament, Italy looked like its old self.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get going in our first game; yes, we were a bit
lucky,'' Maldini said. ``But when we got the early goal today, we
relaxed and played good soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italians finished strong on nearly every possession,
peppering Cameroon goalkeeper Jacques Song'o with an array of near
misses after Di Biagio's first goal.
</P>
<P>
   Italy then was helped considerably when Cameroon's Kalla Nkongo
was red-carded for a cleats-first tackle from behind on Di Biagio
just before halftime, meaning he was ejected from the game and
Cameroon had to play 10 against 11 the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   On this night, that was like setting up target practice for the
Italian forwards, specifically Baggio, Alessandro Del Pierro (who
entered in the second half) and Vieri.
</P>
<P>
   Vieri's first goal of the night came in the 75th minute, only
moments after Del Pierro fired a strong shot that Song'o barely
knocked over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Vieri took a pass near the right-front corner of the box,
chipped the ball to his right and fired a loft shot over the head
of Song'o. Vieri's second goal came from close range after he
dribbled his way clear of trouble in the box, then side-kicked it
past Song'o.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great scoring goals; I love scoring goals,'' Vieri said.
``Tonight was a great night to get two, but the important thing is
our team is looking good for moving on.''

JACK BIBLO, 91, SELLER OF USED BOOKS, DIES
</HEADLINE>
   (dc) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Biblo, a bookish sort of man who spent a musty
half century on Manhattan's Book Row as the founding proprietor of
the Biblo &AMP; Tannen bookstore on Fourth Avenue, then retired at 73
to open a smaller store around the corner from his home in Brooklyn
Heights, died on June 5 at Long Island College Hospital in
Brooklyn. He was 91 and until a couple of years ago had been active
at the Biblo bookstore on Hicks Street.
</P>
<P>
   It's been a while since the bustling stretch of Fourth Avenue
from Eighth to 14th Streets had more than 30 stores specializing in
rare, out-of-print or merely used books. It is a tribute to Biblo &AMP;
Tannen's standing, not to mention the proprietors' foresight in
buying their building in 1955, that when it finally closed in 1979
it was one of the few survivors of a storied tradition.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who never fulfilled his dream of reading every book
in the public library, Biblo had quite a run for himself. From the
time he opened the first Biblo bookstore on 14th Street in 1928
until he and his partner, Jack Tannen, closed their last store, at
63 Fourth Ave., between 9th and 10th Streets, he had helped sell
hundreds of thousands of books and become something of a local
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Biblo also did quite well for someone whose formal schooling
ended with the eighth grade, but then he received a remarkable
advanced education at what it would be a shame not to call Biblo
Tech. Which is to say he was at once self-taught and got all of his
book learning by haunting New York public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   To hear him tell it, Biblo, a Brooklyn native whose original
name was Biblowitz, could hardly have avoided developing a love of
books growing up in a neighborhood that attracted Jewish immigrants
of such passionate intellectual, social and cultural interests that
when they weren't giving street corner speeches they would be
boning up at the local library.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tribute to Biblo's personal passion for reading that
when he found the libraries in East New York and neighboring
Brownsville too crowded for comfort he would walk to more deserted
libraries in less bookish neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving school Biblo held a series of odd jobs, among them
working on a horse-drawn laundry wagon and as a waiter in the
Catskills, but he preferred the leisurely life of reading, so much
so that by the time he read his way up to the main branch of the
New York Public Library, his mother provided the daily dime to
cover his subway fares.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a man who worked in distribution for the Hearst
newspapers (but would not allow a copy of what he regarded as
scurrilous yellow journalism into his home) Biblo later ran a
newsstand on 47th Street in Manhattan, did well enough to finance a
three-month hitchhiking trip across the country, then returned
determined to enter the book business.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing $300 from his mother, he opened his first store at age
22 on 14th Street in Manhattan and a few months later converted one
of his regular customers, Jack Tannen, a tie salesman, into a full
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The two Jacks quickly became the odd couple of Book Row. Tannen,
who died in 1991, was a highly gregarious sort, an aspiring actor
who loved the limelight, while Biblo was almost a sobersides, a
quiet, reserved man who provided a counterweight to his
irrepressible partner.
</P>
<P>
   In a notoriously marginal business, whose need for low rents
made Fourth Avenue an ideal location, the partners had a rough
going in the early days, often sleeping in their store overnight so
they could get to the Salvation Army warehouse early enough to have
their pick of the day's offerings before opening the store at 9 and
keeping it open until midnight to squeeze in every available
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Like other stores at the time what kept Biblo &AMP; Tannen going
during the Depression was a lucrative under-the-counter trade in
what booksellers called erotica and the courts condemned as
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The partners also developed an expertise in first editions, but
while other stores specialized in specific areas, like art or
music, their store, which eventually stocked 100,000 books, covered
the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way the partners started a reprint publishing house,
Canaveral Press, which specialized in reissues of works in the
public domain but also issued previously unpublished works by Edgar
Rice Burroughs, the creator of Tarzan, a Biblo favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after a flare-up of allergies, an occupational hazard of
a musty business, forced Tannen to retire, and Biblo to open a
smaller store that his wife Frances still operates in Brooklyn
Heights, Biblo said reading every book in the public library was
not his only unfulfilled ambition.
</P>
<P>
   He had also, he said, dreamed of going to Africa to look for
Tarzan.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife he is survived by a sister, Lillian
Goodman of Baton Rouge, La., and a brother, Albert, of Miami.

LEFTY DOES IN ROJAS AND METS, 5-4, AGAINST EXPOS
</HEADLINE>
   (dc)

<P>
   MONTREAL _ The rule of thumb in baseball is that right-handed
hitters have more trouble with right-handed pitching than they do
with lefties on the mound. Which is why there are so many questions
surrounding Mel Rojas' seasonlong inability to get right-handed
hitters out.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his split-finger fastball, Rojas, who is a
right-hander, said he has always had more success against
left-handed hitters. But the hard-throwing Mets reliever is at a
loss to explain why righties are currently batting .391 against
him, as opposed to the lefties' .192 average.
</P>
<P>
   It was a left-handed hitter who finally did Rojas (3-1) and the
Mets in Wednesday evening. Bradley Fullmer's two-out bases-loaded
single, which a diving Brian McRae could not quite come up with in
short center field, proved to be the difference in Montreal's 5-4
victory. It came on Rojas' first pitch to the left-handed hitting
first baseman, moments after Bob Apodaca, the pitching coach, had
visited the mound with the left-hander Brian Bohanon warming up in
the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the right-handed hitters, who picked up three more
hits in five official at-bats against Rojas in his one and
two-thirds innings (including a Shane Andrews leadoff double in the
bottom of the ninth), who really caused Rojas to lose this game.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's game-winning rally came after McRae had tied the
score at 4-4 in the top of the ninth with a leadoff homer off
Ugueth Urbina. That home run spared Rojas _ who had allowed a
go-ahead run in the bottom of the eighth _ only momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third time in the last five games on this trip that
the Mets had lost in the bottom of the ninth. The Mets have now
lost five times since sending reliever Greg McMichael to Los
Angeles on June 4 in part of the Hideo Nomo deal. The bullpen has
been charged with four of those losses.
</P>
<P>
   After breezing through four relatively quick scoreless innings,
the teams were tied at 3-3 after six.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored first on a two-out, fifth-inning single over
short from Bobby Jones off Carl Pavano, the promising rookie the
Expos acquired from Boston as the main ingredient in the Pedro
Martinez trade. A pitcher driving in a run is rare, but it was
Jones' second r.b.i. of the season, and his second in as many
starts. The Met right-hander, who is 5 for 22 (.227) from the plate
this year, is 3 for his last 5.
</P>
<P>
   But the Expos roared back with a pair of runs in the bottom of
the fifth, the first on Rondell White's leadoff home run to center
field. The second scored on Shane Andrews' groundout, after Mark
Grudzielanek had singled following White's home run and Chris
Widger had doubled Grudzielanek to third.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, after Mike Piazza had reached first by grounding a
single off a diving Grudzielanek's glove at short, John Olerud
delivered a stand-up triple to tie the score. No slide was
necessary after White, the Montreal center fielder, and right
fielder Vladimir Guerrero collided in right-center field, seconds
after White had dropped Olerud's long drive to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   To make things worse for Guerrero, he dropped a Carlos Baerga
liner on the very next pitch trying to grab the ball, jai alai
style. Olerud scored easily from third, Baerga stayed at first and
the Mets had a short-lived 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero began to make amends for his mistakes almost
immediately. He robbed the next batter, Butch Huskey, of extra
bases with a fine catch at the wall in right, then turned and
doubled Baerga off to end the inning. Baerga had figured hit all
the way, and was nearly home when Guerrero's throw completed the
double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the sixth, Guerrero reached first on a one-out
infield single. Rey Ordonez made a sensational diving play at short
to prevent the ball from going into the outfield, before deciding
he had no chance on a throw to first. Bradley Fullmer followed with
a hit-and-run single to right, sending Guerrero to third. Then,
with White up, Fullmer and Guerrero executed a successful double
steal to tie the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer broke first, just before Jones's pitch bounced in front
of Piazza. The catcher threw to Baerga at second, and Guerrero
broke for home. Baerga one-hopped the relay, however, and Guerrero
scored. &QL;

NO, RANGERS CAN'T LOOK TO RYAN FOR HELP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The best pitcher at The Ballpark in Arlington
last night watched from a luxury suite, frowned at the idea, and
said he'll pass, thanks all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he knows that the Rangers are ``undecided'' on their
Saturday starter and are desperate for help in their starting
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. Been there, done that, got the T-shirt to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   No, he won't be pulling his uniform _ the only one ever retired
by the Rangers _ out of the showcase in The Legends of the Game
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Ryan is 51 _ my how the years have flown by _ and hasn't
thrown a pitch in a real game since the one that blew out the ulnar
nerve in his right elbow in Seattle on Sept. 22, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   I'd still put my money on him over some of the forgettable
performances we've seen on the mound here lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I can still crank it up over 90,'' Ryan said. ``The arm's
just fine. It's the rest of the body that's worn out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin resisted the temptation of
making a personal plea for the future Hall of Famer to reconsider,
which is good. Watching a grown man on his knees, crying and
begging, always makes me a little queasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't think I haven't thought about it,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten to that point for Melvin and the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   So how bad is it? Glad you asked.
</P>
<P>
   So bad that on Tuesday Melvin was ``thisclose'' to pulling off a
deal with Toronto for 41-year-old right-hander Dave Stieb, who also
retired after the 1993 season after his release by the White Sox.
Instead, the Blue Jays elected to call Stieb up themselves after he
put together a string of quality starts at Triple-A Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   A clause in Stieb's contract gave the Blue Jays 48 hours to call
him up or lose him after any club contacted his agent and expressed
its intent to bring him to the big leagues. At least two teams,
including the Rangers, were ready to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   This, friends, is what pitching in the big leagues has come to:
In the same week, Stieb is back in the majors after not pitching
for four years, and Anaheim knuckleballer Steve Sparks, who hadn't
pitched for a major-league team since 1996, shuts the Rangers down
despite an 0-8 record and 6-plus earned-run average in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody call 911. Immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Every day Melvin walks into a conference room adjacent to his
office, where he keeps an array of marker boards listing the
starting rotations and pitching depth of every team in the major
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I usually spend an hour in there a day,'' Melvin said, ``just
staring at the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a restful 60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly you see that you're not as bad off as you think,''
Melvin said. ``Almost everyone has the same problems. Between
expansion and all the guys who are on the disabled list _ and there
are a ton of them _ that's what makes it tough. If all those guys
were healthy, teams might have some extra pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe then they could afford to trade someone _ anyone _ to the
Rangers, who remain unsure who'll start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're signed to a player contract, you've got a heartbeat
and there's a `P' behind your name, you're a candidate,'' manager
Johnny Oates said, ``unless your name is Wetteland.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering what he has seen the past few weeks, Oates might
even drop the heartbeat qualification.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a trade, which Melvin deems unlikely, the Rangers will
have little choice but to summon Todd Van Poppel from Oklahoma, a
move the Rangers' GM would much rather not make.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to see him stay and pitch a full year someplace,''
Melvin said. ``He's never done that. But we may not have any choice
but to bring him up to pitch Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly disquieting to Melvin that Van Poppel is out
of options, which means the Rangers will have to keep him on the
big-league roster or risk losing him if they try to send him back
down. That already happened earlier this season when they lost
Julio Santana to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always nervous about calling somebody up when they're out
of options,'' Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, unless Ryan has a change of heart, the Rangers
are out of options, too.
</P>
<P>
   The one ray of hope is that Melvin plans to spend the weekend at
his boyhood home in Canada, helping his parents celebrate their
50th wedding anniversary. The last two major trades he has pulled
off for pitching help _ John Burkett in '96 and Rick Helling last
year _ came while he was at home in Chatham, Ontario, visiting with
his family.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin needs the same good luck charm to work again.
</P>
<P>
   It's that or go back to Ryan and grovel.
