ONLY ONE CHOICE FOR DODGRS GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I fee hurt, scorned, wounded, neglected, rejected, even
humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   For some strange reason, the Los Angeles Dodgers haven't
interviewed me yet for their general manager position, a slight
that has caused me unbearable pain and incalculable embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   As you might be aware by now, the Dodgers' Three Wise Men, Peter
O'Malley, a former team owner, Bob Graziano, a former team CPA, and
Tom Lasorda, a former national spokesperson for Slim Fast, have
been scouring the universe to locate the right person to fill such
a vital job.
</P>
<P>
   I swear they've interviewed everyone except Kofi Annan, but not
once has my name appeared on their lengthening list of candidates
that includes Dave Dombrowski, Kevin Malone, Dean Taylor, Jim
Bowden, Bob Watson and Omar Minaya.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   What have I done to deserve such harsh treatment?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, I've always thought Peter O'Malley's greatest virtue was his
genetic kinship to Walter O'Malley and I've pegged Graziano as the
most lovable puppet to appear on the American stage since Charlie
McCarthy. But I've always worshiped at the shrine of Lasorda,
dutifully relaying to readers for years his George Gershwin-like
hymns on such diverse subjects as Jack Clark, culinary excess, Dave
Kingman, pizza, pasta, Bill Russell, fisticuffs, Michelangelo,
etc., etc., etc.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like I don't have credentials.
</P>
<P>
   I did play high school baseball and have covered many World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   It's also documented publicly that I once told Peter O'Malley
that he should sign a free agent named Tim Raines this was when the
Dodgers were coming off a lousy season and when Raines was a young
Montreal Expo star and among baseball's top base stealers but
O'Malley countered that Raines was unneeded because his team had
Ken Landreaux.
</P>
<P>
   I was a strong advocate of the Dodgers pursuing other free
agents like Barry Bonds and Greg Maddux and Roberto Alomar, but
O'Malley ignored my advice and stuck to the bottom line monetary
principles he learned at the Wharton School of Business at the
University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder the Dodgers haven't won a post-season game since 1988!
</P>
<P>
   I also have the proper pedigree to become the Dodgers' GM.
</P>
<P>
   After all, I am a sportswriter, and the Dodgers have a sacred
history of bring people like me into their organization, from Red
Patterson to Lee Scott right up to Fred Claire.
</P>
<P>
   I'm saddened and disappointed that not one of the Three Wise Men
has even had the decency to pick up the phone and give me a
courtesy call, but life is filled with such tragedies and I'll
endure it.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of my getting an opportunity at what has been a lifetime
goal of mine having a shot to write Bob Graziano's biography would
be the only assignment I desire more than becoming Dodger GM I'll
reluctantly offer my recommendations for a job now being held
momentarily by Tom Lasorda:
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lasorda: Why not? The guy's been around baseball almost
since it was invented, and there is never a dull moment with him in
the vicinity. He says he doesn't want it, but I don't believe him.
He'd need an assistant to dot the i's and cross the t's in player
contracts, but he still has plenty of energy even though he's
getting as old as Zsa Zsa. Who better to serve as Lasorda's
manservant than Bill Russell?
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky: The Fox people claim to want more flash and
dash with the Dodgers, and they'd definitely get it if Monica winds
up in the GM booth. She has a proven record of being loyal to her
boss. Her tabloid-shadowed presence definitely would result in the
Dodgers receiving extensive media coverage, but, alas, it might
cause a rebellion among the Dodgers players' wives.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Claire: Might be General Manager of the Century for the
work he did during his 10 year incumbency under the terrible fiscal
restraints of Peter O'Malley. Oh sure, he blew it with the Pedro
Martinez for Delino DeShields trade, but Lasorda never should have
pitched to Jack Clark, either. We all make mistakes. I once
rejected Arnold Schwarzenegger's impassioned pleas to do a book
with him, and there went my chance forever at a villa on the French
Riviera. At least Claire didn't give his imprimatur to that
embarrassing mid-season Dodger trade in which, among other live
bodies, they got rid of Mike Piazza and acquired Bobby Bonilla, who
some insist isn't alive on those rare occasions he puts on a
baseball uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Donoho: Nice guy who needs a job. Liked by everybody.
Showed for almost 10 years at KABC that talent and knowledge are
irrelevant to becoming a successful sportscaster. I'm willing to
bet that Todd can prove talent and knowledge are also irrelevant in
becoming a successful GM, or I'll take a hike.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Graziano: Doesn't Graziano know that Rupert Murdoch's
behind-the-scenes Dodger emissaries, Peter Chernin and Chase Carey,
are eventually going to oust him, too? Why not beat them to the
punch like Rocky Graziano would have done? Why not apply for
another, less important job in the organization? Graziano would
have made it big in one of those old tinhorn dictator regimes in
the 1950s in South America. He's one of those blessed guys able to
survive while everyone around him is being purged.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla: Since he's not doing anything on the field to
earn the millions of dollars the Dodgers are paying him, Bonilla
should be propped up off it to at least give the impression he can
do something other than bilk big-time corporations out of their
money. He could hire the Lakers' Elden Campbell as his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McDonnell: This sterling media trailblazer would be the
perfect GM/propagandist for the Dodgers. If, by some quirk of
random fate he failed to put together a winning team and this is a
man by his own humble admission has never made a lousy trade during
20 years of passionate Dodger advocacy on the radio it won't
matter. Ol' Joe will simply gulp the Bill Clinton Truth Serum he
carries with him at all times and will blithely go on the air and
insist everything is sailing along well with the team.
Filibustering fantasy and frivolous fables have become standard
material on McDonnell's afternoon drive-time wonderland romp.
</P>
<P>
   Peter O'Malley: OK, laugh. Now, have you stopped? Not yet? I'll
give you a few more hours. Now ready? Now ready? I think Bottom
Line Pete would be a splendid GM because someone else's money would
now be at stake instead of his own. And, anyway, what else does
O'Malley have to do except count all his money and be grateful
everyday of his life that Somebody Up There saw to it that he was
born the son of Walter O'Malley.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Records fell again as triple-digit heat scorched
Los Angeles for a third day in a row, triggering a tornado in the
San Gabriel Valley, widespread power outages, an all-time high for
electricity usage and violent thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said only slightly cooler temperatures are expected
today.
</P>
<P>
   Officials reported the unusual tropical weather had widely
different consequences across Southern California, including the
tornado that knocked down power lines and uprooted trees freeways
to the flash floods in Big Bear, a brush fire near La Crescenta,
rain in Thousand Oaks, and thunder storms and power outages in the
Antelope and San Fernando valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The mercury reached 100 in Lancaster and 104 in Palmdale where a
violent thunderstorm knocked out power, churned up dust clouds,
sparked at least one brush fire and dropped half-inch diameter
hail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so loud you can hear it on the roof,'' Alis Clausen,
Southern California Edison district manager, said from Edison's
office at 10th Street West and Avenue M. ``It looks like ice out of
a soft drink.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past 24 hours, the Los Angeles Fire Department
responded to 25 heat-related emergencies, spokesman Jim Wells said
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime there's a heat wave, we get an increased number of
exposure calls,'' said Wells who cautioned residents to stay
indoors, curtail their activities during the hottest part of the
day and to drink plenty of liquids.
</P>
<P>
   Dietricha Sweeney, an L.A.-area resident, took in salt tablets,
ate potassium-filled potatoes and kept a water bottle by her side
Monday _ to avoid another heat stroke, which she suffered five
years ago from similar intense heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last couple of days, it's been horrendous,'' Sweeney said.
``It's hellish and very oppressive. I hope it breaks soon. You're
sort of wilted and it zaps your ability to think.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Richard Todd of the Los Angeles Police Department shared
Sweeney's sentiments, only the Valley Traffic Division motorcycle
officer was weighed down in a required helmet, vest and knee-high
boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's brutal heat,'' said Todd. ``Plus, we have the heat from
the engine. We have no chance to cool down like in a car. The air
is so warm.''
</P>
<P>
   In the city of San Fernando, the 1400 block of Hewitt Street
lost electrical power Sunday evening from 6:30 p.m. until 9 a.m.
Monday prompting police and city officials to canvas the street to
check on a large group of elderly residents who live there, said
Sarah Magana-Withers, the city's community preservation officer.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Water and Power spokeswoman Darlene Battle said
customers used electricity at an all-time high Monday. The utility
registered 5,640 megawatts of power, breaking the previous record
of 5,520 megawatts set on Sept. 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's sweltering temperatures caused scattered power
outages for about 200 customers, Battle said the utility does not
foresee brownouts. It is recommending, however, that customers
conserve energy during the hottest parts of the day.
</P>
<P>
   At California State University, Northridge, where the afternoon
temperature peaked at 104, several students congregated under a
patio umbrella to compare summer notes and class schedules, but
quickly opted to move the meeting into the air-conditioned game
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too hot outside, even in the shade I can feel myself
burning up,'' said 23 year-old Noel Rodmen, a CSUN senior.
</P>
<P>
   Among the victims of the latest heat wave was Andrew Perry, a
23-year-old Northridge resident who spent Sunday _ sans sunscreen _
at a local water park. Blisters and red skin highlighted his
second-degree burned face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should've known better, I just forgot to put sunscreen on
this time,'' the emergency medical technician sighed. ``I'll
probably be paying for this little episode for the rest of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said a slight cooling trend was expected today. A
decrease in humidity levels also was forecast, the National Weather
Service said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't feel much cooler in the San Fernando Valley,'' said
Vladimir Ryshko, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
``It will be slightly cool on Wednesday, otherwise it will still be
warm.''

ANGELS FEAST ON EAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In each city the Angels visit, manager Terry Collins hears the
same questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   How has this team done it? How has this team overcome so many
injuries? How could this team even be close to winning a division
title?
</P>
<P>
   It's simply hunger, according to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The players, most of whom have never tasted the thrill of
October baseball, are hungry for that experience. The organization
hasn't been to the playoffs since 1986, and only one who was on
that team _ pitcher Chuck Finley _ is still with the club.
</P>
<P>
   Only one player on the Angels' roster has ever played in a World
Series _ Ken Hill, who pitched for the Cleveland Indians in 1995
against the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The rest have no idea what it feels like to get there, and it
serves as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grind like a bunch of rats,'' first baseman Darin Erstad
said. ``We know we don't have the most talent. Guys don't care
about numbers, they just want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And win the Angels have. They started the daunting East Coast
trip Aug. 24 with a schedule that read like a playoff primer. But
they won three of five games against the American League's best
team, the New York Yankees, and they took two of three from the
Boston Red Sox, who lead in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   They're 5-3 with two games left on the trip, beginning tonight,
against the AL Central-leading Indians. All five Angels victories
on this trip have come after they trailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be here (in a pennant race). We've earned it,''
Collins said. ``There's nothing for us to get uptight about. Just
relax and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easier to talk about having fun this season. The team that
was too uptight in 1995 _ when the team blew an 11-game lead over
the Seattle Mariners in less than two months _ is comfortable now
with the pennant race pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In '95, guys were intimidated when we went to New York in a
pennant-race because we were young and inexperienced,'' shortstop
Gary DiSarcina said. ``There's a different feeling now. Guys are
excited to play.''
</P>
<P>
   But the nature of fighting with the Texas Rangers for a division
title, instead of holding on to a big lead, doesn't allow for the
Angels to let up. Should the Angels hang on to take their division,
they'll face either the Red Sox or Yankees in the Division Series,
and do so with the knowledge that they finished the regular season
12-10 against their potential playoff opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intensity of the whole team has helped everybody play
better,'' center fielder Jim Edmonds said. ``We haven't had an
11-game lead. We've been in second place most of the year. It might
be easier to play in second place than first place, especially when
you're down only a couple games.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with as much attention the East Coast trip has received,
the Angels say they know that wins against teams like the Royals
and Devil Rays will be just as important.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a team standpoint, we have to keep our focus and not get
too carried away,'' designated hitter Tim Salmon said. ``Yeah, it's
been exciting, but we've still got a month to play.''

MARINERS NO HELP TO JEFF FASSERO, WITH BATS OR GLOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Things went so badly for Mariner left-hander Jeff
Fassero in August that Monday night he gave up an earned run while
taking a shower.
</P>
<P>
   The four earned runs he surrendered against the Boston Red Sox
at Fenway Park increased by one after the game when the official
scorer changed an error charged to newly acquired second baseman
David Bell to a hit, making every run in the Sox's 5-1 victory
before 28,553 fans earned.
</P>
<P>
   Don't you believe it.
</P>
<P>
   On a night Fassero's supporting cast mustered just four hits off
Bret Saberhagen, Dennis Eckersley and Tom Gordon, every Seattle
infielder mishandled catchable balls. Three of the
almost-but-not-quite plays contributed to runs.
</P>
<P>
   The first two came in the fourth inning after Fassero had
retired the first nine batters he faced. Mariner shortstop Alex
Rodriguez went to his left to flag down a grounder hit by Sox
leadoff hitter Darren Lewis, but the ball ticked off the end of
Rodriguez's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know (Lewis) can run and I knew I had to be quick,''
Rodriguez said. ``Maybe I was too quick.''
</P>
<P>
   John Valentin, the next batter, chopped a grounder toward third
base. Russ Davis charged, attempted to make a between-hop catch,
but caught only air.
</P>
<P>
   Double.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough play,'' manager Lou Piniella said, ``but you
have to keep (the ball) in front of you somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Davis, ``I did the best I could. I was aggressive the way
I'm supposed to be. And even if I catch it, (Valentin) beats it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   One walk, sacrifice fly and wild pitch later, Fassero looked at
a two-run deficit. The Red Sox, leading the American League
wild-card playoff race despite being 18{ games behind the New York
Yankees, never relinquished the lead. They added two runs in the
sixth when shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, a Most Valuable Player
candidate, hit a two-run homer, his 29th of the season, into the
center-field bleachers.
</P>
<P>
   Boston tacked on another run in the eighth when Fassero hit Mo
Vaughn with a pitch and Mike Stanley smacked a hard line drive that
handcuffed Bell, playing his first game after being acquired from
the Cleveland Indians early Monday morning for Joey Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Belated single.
</P>
<P>
   The play preceded Troy O'Leary's run-scoring single that KO'd
Fassero and prevented him from pitching his eighth complete game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a ball do that before,'' Bell said. ``It
dropped like a knuckleball at the last second, but I think I still
should have caught it. I felt bad for Jeff because he pitched so
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell has seen Fassero's lack of support only once.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a month-long situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write the same thing you wrote the last time,'' Fassero said.
</P>
<P>
   And the time before that. And the time before that.
</P>
<P>
   The entire month of August, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Fassero ended July with 10 wins and goes into September with 10
wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has pitched much better than his record (10-11)
indicates,'' Rodriguez said. ``The record doesn't show it, but he
has been consistent all season and we haven't given him much
(offensive) support.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are averaging 2.7 runs in Fassero's 11 losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating for him and for all of us,'' center fielder
Ken Griffey Jr. said. ``We want to score runs for him, but haven't
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who leads the AL with 47 homers, doubled in the first
inning and singled and scored Seattle's only run in the seventh on
Davis' two-out single to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Taking no chances with the 34-year-old Saberhagen, Sox manager
Jimy Williams replaced the right-hander with the 43-year-old
Eckersley and then gave Gordon the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gordon didn't qualify for his 39th save in 40 chances _
the lead was too large _ he retired Seattle in order.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen won his 12th game and earned praise from the M's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I faced him a couple of years ago in Colorado and he threw the
ball much better (Monday night),'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Griffey, who was 2-for-16 lifetime against Saberhagen
going into the game, ``His pitches had great movement. He knows
what he wants to do. He used to throw harder and you'd get two or
three hits a game against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, he mixes it up more.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen mixed in fastball, sliders and changeups to stymie
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra, meanwhile, continued to play like an MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of (candidates),'' said Griffey, the reigning
MVP. ``It's going to be very close.''

SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS ASIDE, JOEY CORA'S DEPARTURE LONG OVERDUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ So, Joey Cora had 19 errors this season with the
Mariners. That is not the reason he is no longer one of the ``You
Gotta Love These Guys'' guys.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Cora's prolonged tenure with the M's was based on a
prolonged love affair with too much hitting, not enough defense and
an unwillingness to make what the fans might have viewed as
unpopular moves.
</P>
<P>
   That may be confusing, considering the wildly unpopular handling
of Randy Johnson, but it is par for the course for the Mariners
over these tumultuous past three years of trying to maintain a '95
dream team that needed more upgrades than it got.
</P>
<P>
   Cora's prolonged tenure with the Mariners seemed to all but
exemplify the team's inability or unwillingness to upgrade the
bullpen and defense, especially at the expense of the perfectly
marketable and star-studded lineup.
</P>
<P>
   How? Well, in 1995, Cora committed 22 errors for your Seattle
Mariners _ just to show you how far back this problem goes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, during one road swing through Chicago late that season
_ just before the Mariners went on that tear to win the American
League West championship and gain their first playoff berth in 18
long years _ Cora made two horrendous throwing errors in a single
game against the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Lou Piniella pulled Cora from the game and the next day,
Felix Fermin started at second base, not Cora.
</P>
<P>
   But, as could have been predicted, Fermin's lack of bat hurt the
M's more than Cora's lack of glove. So Cora (a career .278 hitter
who batted .297 in '95) did not stay in Piniella's dog house long.
</P>
<P>
   The little second baseman with the pins in his hat and the
quirky infield rituals was back on the field for the remainder of
'95 _ trying his best to throw somewhere in the vicinity of first
baseman Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Cora became a Seattle fixture, even if he was a makeshift
leadoff hitter, at best.
</P>
<P>
   He got radio ads for Gig Harbor car dealers. He said gas station
attendants let him put free gas into his BMW. He and Alex Rodriguez
worked extra hard in spring training on double-play balls, which
parlayed into more radio and TV ads starring Rodriguez and Cora.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, you had to love a little guy who wants to rip
doubles and hit homers and shoot for a .300 batting average, even
if he throws the baseball to first base like he was playing a game
of barroom darts.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why the Mariners were eager to re-sign Cora. He was one
of the most ``You Gotta Love These Guys'' guys.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Little Joey Cora is gone.
</P>
<P>
   If there is symbolism in this development _ beyond the fact that
the M's might finally be conceding that defense does win games _ it
is that the Mariners have severed their biggest, most emotional
links to the magical season of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cora follows Johnson's embattled departure by exactly one month.
Ironically, the Mariners kept Cora in Seattle longer than was
prudent because he was a fan favorite, yet refused to offer Johnson
a long-term deal because they were uncertain of the Big Unit's
incredible box-office appeal and instant on-field credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Cora ($1.6 million this season) was a cheaper token of
sentimentality than Johnson and had so convincingly tugged on the
fans' heartstrings.
</P>
<P>
   Cora cried on the bench after Game 6 of the AL Championship
Series, when Cleveland ousted the M's from their glorious first
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cora has been traded to that AL Central power.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, 33, talked openly this past month about his impending
departure from the Mariners. He was totally discouraged about how
things had unraveled here _ so distraught he said he was not sure
he wanted to play on another team next season.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he will change his mind now. Cora got a good deal for
himself. He is playing with a contender. He will not have to hit
leadoff, but second or ninth, which will be a bonus for Cleveland _
hurting in the win column since the loss of slugger Jim Thome.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mariners, it is also a good deal. Don't get caught up in
the sentimental feelings that make Cora's departure seem more
important than it is.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners needed to make this move. They probably needed to
make this move _ and a couple others like it _ much earlier than
this. Better defense, a better bullpen (and a better deal with, or
for, Johnson) might have made a difference in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least the M's are looking ahead. They should consider
themselves lucky Cleveland was willing to trade a young infielder
like David Bell. Goodness knows the M's need help to make the lives
of Rodriguez and Gold Glove-to-be first baseman David Segui easier.
</P>
<P>
   Cora's bat was not enough to continue with this killer infield.
The memories he helped create were good, but a baseball town like
Seattle can not live by memories alone.
</P>
<P>
   The M's need to make upgrades. Improvements. Tough deals.
Free-agent wheeling and dealing. No one should shed a tear over
this.

PRESALES JUST TIP OF ICEBERG FOR `TITANIC' VIDEO RELEASE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attention editors: Today in story refers to Tuesday, Sep. 1) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
(Daily News Staff Writer Dave McNary contributed to this story.)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It hit video stores in a big way Monday:
``Titanic'' _ the home video that thousands of fans reserved weeks
ahead and then lined up outside stores to get their hands on the
first copies at 12:01 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see it again. It's so romantic, so real. It makes
you cry and admire them because they loved each other so much,''
said Tan Duong, who brought his 15-month-old son, Harry, with him
Monday to a Blockbuster store in Northridge where he reserved a
copy of the video.
</P>
<P>
   Many outlets in the 4,000-store Blockbuster chain hosted ``Bon
Voyage'' parties Monday night through 2 a.m. today, offering
chances to the first 100 customers at each store to win luxury
cruise vacations to anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling kind of lucky. I want to enter that chance to win
that cruise,'' said Northridge resident Sharon Lloyd said after
prepaying for ``Titanic.'' ``I didn't see the movie. But I heard
it's pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount Studios shipped more than 20 million copies of James
Cameron's Oscar-winning ``Titanic'' to retailers.
</P>
<P>
   At the Northridge Blockbuster store at the corner of Reseda
Boulevard and Nordhoff Street, 270 of the 400 available tapes were
presold by 5 p.m., said Kelly Haynie, a store manager. Customers
left a $5 deposit and later paid $19.99 and received a $5 gift card
toward store purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Haynie expected mostly college students from neighboring
California State University, Northridge to wait in lines Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see Leonardo DiCaprio,'' Haynie said. ``It was
the box office No. 1 movie. It'll probably be some sort of a
collector's item one day.''
</P>
<P>
   And the chain guaranteed rentals of the movie with 262 available
tapes _ or about four times what's usually available on
just-released movies and the most on hand Haynie has ever seen in
her three years with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Video in Sherman Oaks, an L.A. suburb, also began
selling the tapes beginning at midnight, offering free previously
viewed ``Titanic'' home videos to the first 25 people in line, said
Krisztina Kellenyi, a shift leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to run out of tapes. We're getting rushes of
people every 15 to 20 minutes,'' Kellenyi said of those prepaying
for the two-cassette video that industry officials estimate will
become the all-time biggest video seller.
</P>
<P>
   The 193-minute movie comes out on video as it recently sailed
past the $600 million mark in domestic theatrical grosses _ nearly
$140 million more than the nearest rival _ ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Northridge is a Los Angeles-area suburb.  &QL;

SEAHAWKS NAME JOHN FRIESZ BACKUP QUARTERBACK FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Dennis Erickson had called it a competition,
but the winner Monday felt like the loser.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks coach went with experience over expectations in
naming John Friesz the No. 2 quarterback to starter Warren Moon for
Sunday's season opener at Philadelphia. That leaves Jon Kitna No. 3
_ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I did what I needed to do in the preseason,''
Kitna said. ``I did everything they asked of me. Things still
didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was an open competition or not,'' he said.
``If the decision was based on what happened in preseason, I felt
like the decision would have been made already. But there's much
more to it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to blame Kitna for being disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seahawks' five preseason games, Kitna had a higher
completion percentage (.692), more passing yards (423) and a higher
quarterback rating (90.5) than Friesz (.563, 332 and 74.5).
</P>
<P>
   But Erickson admitted his decision wasn't based on the
preseason. It was one of those feel things that coaches get.
Erickson is going with Friesz because he's in his ninth NFL season
and fourth year in this offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not being able to practice very much as the backup, being able
to come in off the bench with that experience in a game situation
where he's been there many, many times before, that was why we made
that decision,'' Erickson said. ``If somebody is hurt, the guy is
going to have to come off the bench and win the game for you.
Experience makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Friesz has started 37 games in the NFL. Kitna one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would you rather have go in the game? The guy who's played
one game and one series in the regular season?'' Kitna said. ``I
know the perception of me is a risk-and-reward type quarterback.
That's me. Yeah, I might go in and throw an 80-yard touchdown. But
I might go in and throw an 80-yard interception, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Erickson has not changed his mind about Kitna. He still thinks
the third-year quarterback from Central Washington University is
the future of this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Kitna has fallen from grace, it's that Friesz has
played his way back into the picture after missing most of last
season with a broken thumb on his passing hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's what Kitna had done, it's what John has
done the last 2{, three weeks,'' Erickson said. ``John has played
extremely well. He's starting to throw the ball like he did before
he got hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, before the start of training camp, Erickson said he would
allow Kitna the chance to compete for the backup job. With Moon
holding out for a better contract as the preseason began, the
competition became for the starting job. At one point, Kitna was
playing well enough that management was talking about preparing for
the opener with or without Moon.
</P>
<P>
   Then Moon ended his 25-day holdout, and who would win this John
vs. Jon battle didn't seem to matter much. In truth, it still
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Said Friesz: ``I guess I'm happy, but it wasn't that big a deal.
The bottom line is that all three of us need to continue to work
together for whoever is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Moon: ``It really doesn't matter who the No. 2 guy was. We
know that we have three guys who can play at any given moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Erickson said that he will re-evaluate the backup position
should Moon be injured for any period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, neither one of them is going to have to play in
games,'' Erickson said.

MARINERS SEND JOEY CORA TO CLEVELAND FOR DAVID BELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Joey Cora cleaned out his locker at the Kingdome three
weeks ago and the Mariners finished the job Monday morning, trading
the popular second baseman to the Cleveland Indians for infielder
David Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey expected something to happen, and I'm happy for him,''
designated hitter Edgar Martinez said Monday night. ``I hate to see
him go because he has been a good teammate and player for us. But
obviously, when things go wrong, you can expect some changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora becomes a victim of a Mariner season gone sour.
</P>
<P>
   The M's started a three-game series against the Boston Red Sox
Monday night with a 62-73 record and tied with the Oakland
Athletics for last place in the American League West, 12{ games
behind the division-leading Anaheim Angels. Bell started at second
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things didn't work out the way we wanted,'' Cora said of the
Mariners. ``It didn't work out for a bunch of reasons, and you can
name any you want. But next year, they might come right back. You
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners' front office hasn't been happy with Cora's defense
and recently had decided not to bring him back next season by
picking up the option year (for $1.8 million) of his contract. They
put him on waivers and the Indians claimed him. Seattle could have
recalled the waivers and kept Cora, but the teams worked out a deal
that makes him eligible for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Players had to be in uniform before midnight Monday night to be
eligible for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Cora's former teammates were disappointed but not
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy (Johnson) and now Joey,'' center fielder Ken Griffey Jr.
said. ``Those are guys who were big parts of where we are today,
but it's not like (the organization) is having a firesale. If that
was the case, they would be getting rid of the highest-paid players
... It's good for Joey to be going where he's going.''
</P>
<P>
   Said right fielder Jay Buhner: ``Nothing surprises me anymore.
It's just part of the business, and I think Joey knew something
like this was inevitable. He was a leader, a guy who kept things
loose in the clubhouse, and he always came to the park ready to
play. You can't have enough of those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora was in his Boston hotel room at 12:30 a.m. when the phone
rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was either an emergency or I was out of there,''
Cora said. ``I was kind of surprised, but I have a couple of
buddies (who play for the Indians) and they had told me there were
some rumors Cleveland was trying to get me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora checked out of the hotel, took an early-morning flight to
Cleveland and arrived at Jacobs Field Monday afternoon, early
enough to participate in the team photo. He didn't have a uniform
number or a jersey with his name on the back, but another
post-season looms.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who lead the AL Central, plan to platoon Cora at
second base with Enrigue Wilson through the remainder of this
season. Cora will start against right-handers. The Indians haven't
committed to how they'll play it next season, but sources close to
the defending AL champions said Monday night the team will pursue
Roberto Alomar during the off-season if the Baltimore Orioles
second baseman _ and brother of Indians catcher Sandy Alomar _
files for free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, batting .282 with two homers, 25 RBIs and 19 errors, took
with him to Cleveland a 16-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a sporadic defensive season, Cora actually has been
playing well the past three weeks. He sensed earlier this month
that his three-year career with the Mariners were nearing an end
and became so convinced of it that he cleaned out his Kingdome
locker before departing on a road trip.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, 33, said then that he expected to be released.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was traded to a probable division champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be nice scoring runs for Manny (Ramirez) instead
of watching him touch second base on the way to home plate,'' Cora
said of the Indians right fielder who hit seven homers against
Seattle this season.
</P>
<P>
   In the 25-year-old Bell, the Mariners are getting a younger
player who can play two positions. Although Bell started at second
base Monday, that position probably will be taken by Carlos
Guillen, acquired from the Houston Astros in the July 31 Randy
Johnson trade.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, playing for Class AAA Tacoma since the deal, has been
sidelined the past four days with an injured hamstring and is
expected to miss three or four more games. He could join the M's
early next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals is to get more athletic, younger and more
flexible,'' said Lee Pelekoudas, the M's vice president of baseball
administration. ``Bell fits that mold.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelekoudas also said that shortstop Giomar Guevara will be
promoted Tuesday from Class AA Orlando when rosters are expanded to
40 players.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to allow us to play some kids in September and
see how they will fit in next season,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
``(Bell) can play more than one position, has some pop and knows
how to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, the son of former major league infielder and current
Detroit Tigers manager Buddy Bell and grandson of Gus Bell, a star
for the Cincinnati Reds in the 1950s and 60s, began the season with
the St. Louis Cardinals but was claimed off waivers by the Indians
after Wilson suffered an injury.
</P>
<P>
   Bell hit an inside-the-park home run off Johnson in his debut
and continued to hit well through July (.282). But he seemed to hit
a wall.
</P>
<P>
   While Cora sizzled in August, Bell fizzled. He went 27-for-120
last month with one home run and six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Indians manager Mike Hargrove thought Bell was wearing down and
wondered if the infielder could be an every-day player.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners want to see for themselves this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He fits in here next season,'' Piniella said. ``He will go to
spring training either fighting for a (starting position),
depending on what we do during the offseason, or he could be a
solid utility player. He fits into the equation somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, playing on a one-year, $200,000 contract, is eligible for
salary arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at Fenway Park about 2{ hours before Monday's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants a chance to play in the postseason and I was
looking forward to it,'' he said. ``It won't happen this year, but
I'm young and am coming to an organzation that has had success in
the past, and it's exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be so exciting if I was 35 or 36 (years old). I
had fun in Cleveland, but it just didn't work out. I had heard they
were trying to get Joey, but didn't think I would be involved. But
you just move on.''

OSUNA NEEDS SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the day the Dodgers learned that Gary Sheffield could miss
the rest of the season with a sprained left ankle, they found out
reliever Antonio Osuna needs surgery on his right elbow and won't
be back until spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, the projected Opening Day closer who pitched erratically
most of the season in a setup role, will undergo arthroscopic
surgery this week to remove bone chips.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who has been complaining about a sore arm the past few
days, had an MRI and CAT scan on Monday. The test revealed bone
fragments in the elbow and Dr. Frank Jobe recommended surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recovery time is about three or four months, and we think
he will be ready for spring training,'' Jobe said. ``That's why we
are doing it now. There is damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna had an MRI last month, which revealed no fragments. He
went 1-1 with a 3.00 ERA in 11 games in August. He complained of a
sore arm on Saturday and went in for a second exam.
</P>
<P>
   Call-ups: Teams can expand their rosters from 25 to 40 players
today.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers reinstated right-hander Ismael Valdes, who will
start tonight against the Phillies, and infielder Tripp Cromer from
the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   They also recalled catcher Paul LoDuca, infielder Alex Cora,
pitchers Gary Rath and Eric Weaver, and purchased the contract of
pitcher Jeff Kubenka.
</P>
<P>
   To make room on the 40-man roster for Kubenka, left-hander Will
Brunson has been designated for assignment.
</P>

   Cromer spent most of the season on the disabled list, recovering
from reconstructive elbow surgery and later for a right thigh
strain. The highlight of his season came July 19 on his first
at-bat after rehab, when he hit a home run in St. Louis.

<P>
   LoDuca, who batted .319 at Triple-A Albuquerque, made his
major-league debut June 21. Most remember that game as the last for
manager Bill Russell and GM Fred Claire, but LoDuca will remember
it for his first and only big-league appearance. He went 1 for 2
with an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Cora, made his debut in June when the Dodgers faced Seattle and
his brother Joey. Cora was with the Dodgers from June 5 to Aug. 1.
He batted .133 in 24 games but was outstanding defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Rath appeared in one game with the Dodgers this year, June 2
when he pitched a perfect inning against St. Louis. He was optioned
back to Triple-A three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver spent most of the year at Albuquerque but did appear in
two games for the Dodgers from May 29 to June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Kubenka is the only recall not to see action with the Dodgers
this year. The left-hander split time at Double-A and Triple-A.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Angel Pena, who batted .335 with 32 doubles, 22 homers
and 105 RBI for Double-A San Antonio, will be recalled after the
Texas League playoffs.

TEXAS A&AMP;M FUMBLES, STUMBLES IN LOSS TO FLORIDA STATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Florida State coach Bobby Bowden, a man
enamored with the element of surprise, startled Texas A&AMP;M with a
fresh wrinkle in his playbook Monday night in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked Seminoles out-Aggied No. 14 Texas A&AMP;M, 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   During a pivotal second half, the Seminoles abandoned the bells
and whistles of their pass-happy offense in favor of a
hammer-and-whistle attack similar to the one favored by
ground-bound A&AMP;M. In short, the Seminoles handed the ball to
tailback Travis Minor, who set a school record for carries in a
game (34), and let him hammer at the A&AMP;M defense.
</P>
<P>
   When they tired of that, quarterback Chris Weinke found
receivers Marvin Minnis and Peter Warrick, the game's most valuable
player, on a series of short completions that allowed Florida State
to erase a 14-10 halftime deficit by controlling the ball, the
clock and both lines of scrimmage throughout the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State outgained A&AMP;M, 205 yards to 20, in the second half
and did not allow the A&AMP;M offense to cross midfield after the final
minute of the second quarter. The Aggies were held to minus-2
rushing yards in the second half and managed only 33 yards on 31
carries (1.1 per attempt).
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Aggies, who lost their 10th consecutive game against a
top-10 opponent, did not succumb until Seminoles kicker Sebastian
Janikowski connected on his third field goal, a 22-yarder, with
3:26 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   By forcing three turnovers, one of which cornerback Jay Brooks
returned for a touchdown, the A&AMP;M defense minimized the damage done
by Minor (34 carries, 146 yards) and Warrick (9 catches, 106
yards). Warrick scored the go-ahead touchdown on the final play of
the third quarter and averaged 17.7 yards on three punt returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the defense did a hell of a job. We just need to
show up for the next game,'' A&AMP;M tailback Sirr Parker said of an
offense that produced only two first downs in the second half and
eight overall.
</P>
<P>
   Added safety Rich Coady, who forced a first-quarter fumble:
``I'm proud of the way the defense played. We never gave up. Maybe
next time, we'll catch some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the Aggies' biggest break will be having the Seminoles
in the rearview mirror. While the A&AMP;M offense failed to cross
midfield in the second half, the Seminoles cranked out drives of
68, 37, 63 and 19 yards on their first four possessions. All but
the 63-yard drive produced points.
</P>
<P>
   After Janikowski ended a 12-play march with a 28-yard field goal
to pull the Seminoles within 14-13, the Aggies responded by moving
backward. Three running plays and a holding penalty resulted in a
loss of 14 yards, forcing Shane Lechler to punt out of the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick returned the kick 21 yards to set up a nine-play,
37-yard march. Appropriately enough, he also ended it by grabbing a
9-yard touchdown strike from Weinke to put Florida State ahead to
stay, 20-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies put themselves in position to pull an upset despite
two first-quarter fumbles that helped the Seminoles build a quick
10-0 lead. But the first-half momentum swung on the final play of
the first quarter, when quarterback Branndon Stewart found Chris
Cole for 45 yards to the Florida State 13-yard line. Five running
plays later, fullback D'Andre Hardeman burrowed into the end zone
from the 1-yard line to pull A&AMP;M within 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   Another big play in the final minute of the first half sent the
Aggies into the locker room with a 14-10 lead, thanks to two
redshirt freshmen. On first-and-10 from the Florida State 33,
Weinke was blindsided by blitzing linebacker Christian Rodriguez.
The ball one-hopped into the arms of Brooks, who returned it 21
yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fortunate to win this game,'' Bowden said. ``I'm
pleased, because the way we were going in the first half, we easily
could have lost.''

COWBOYS CONSIDER RE-SIGNING SHERMAN WILLIAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Dallas Cowboys worked out Sherman Williams
on Monday, and someone even taped his name to his old locker, but
as of late Monday night the club was considering whether to re-sign
the running back who played with the team from 1995-1997.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, team owner Jerry Jones said he was going to speak to
Herschel Walker soon, and a decision could come on him in the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Jones and company had yet to come to terms about who to
sign as a third quarterback. The agent for Jim Miller said the
Cowboys had not contacted him yet about rejoining Chan Gailey, his
position coach in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was deemed expendable when the club signed veteran
Chris Warren last spring. The club released Williams, who has had a
propensity to fumble, before training camp. But when it was
announced that Warren would miss at least four weeks with a groin
injury, the club reconsidered signing Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherman doesn't even know where to line up right now,''
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said. ``Even though he's been here,
he's way behind. It's like bringing in a rookie and saying, `Here,
learn this playbook.' If I'm answering questions now about where
I'm at and where we're at in this offense and we've been going over
it since February, you can only imagine where Sherman is at and he
doesn't even know what our formations are called. So, he's got some
catching up to do.'' JEFFERS COMES HOME
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' locker room staff will have to excuse Patrick
Jeffers if they find him bundled up in his locker this morning.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the trade which brought him to the Cowboys from Denver
on Sunday a dream come true, Jeffers savored his good fortune long
after practice Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at his locker, walking around his locker, looking at his
name and No. 81 scrawled above his locker, the former Fort Worth
Country Day star was among the last to leave the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still pretty amazing to be here,'' Jeffers said. ``I
remember growing up a Cowboys fan. I came over here a couple of
times when I was younger, and I was in awe of the place. Now, I got
my name on the locker and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A third-year pro, Jeffers, 25, who spent the past two years with
the Broncos, didn't know where he would end up when the Broncos
told him Sunday that they weren't bringing him back for a third
year.
</P>
<P>
   However, disappointment and doubt turned to ecstasy and haste
when the Cowboys made the deal with the Broncos. The 6-foot-3,
217-pound Jeffers threw some clothes in a suitcase and jumped on
the first plane out of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny how things worked out,'' Jeffers said. ``I was
thinking I could end up anywhere, and then to end up back here is a
big surprise. It all happened so fast. In a few hours, my whole
life changed. I was packing up everything and coming back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers is making plans for home cooked meals at his parents'
house in Fort Worth and his sister's home in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the Cowboys like Jeffers' size and physical nature
and believe he can contribute immediately on special teams and as a
blocker in the running game. COWBOYS CLAIM TIGHT END
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys claimed tight end Hayward Clay off waivers from
Chicago and released tight end Kendell Watkins, a third-year player
from Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   Clay was a sixth-round choice of the St. Louis Rams in 1996 out
of Texas A&AMP;M. He spent his rookie season with the Rams, seeing
action in 11 games, recovering one fumble. He was released by the
Rams in August of 1997 and sat out the season.

GONZALEZ'S SEVEN RBI POWER RANGERS PAST TIGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Detroit Tigers have the worst record in the
American League, but that's not why right-fielder Bobby Higginson
was booed Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   He was booed because most of the 11,964 spectators wanted to see
Juan Gonzalez finish a tremendous night with a single to right.
Instead they saw Higginson make a nice running catch to deprive
Gonzalez of being the second player in Rangers history to hit for
the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez settled for two doubles, a triple, his 39th home run
and a season-high seven runs batted in as he carried the Rangers to
a 13-2 victory against the Tigers. The victory moved the Rangers
within 21/2 games of the idle Anaheim Angels in the American League
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``He smoked the ball,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
``Four at-bats, four line drives. If he's seeing good pitches and
feeling good, he can do some damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's damage, all against Tigers starter Bryce Florie, came
although he's limited to designated hitter duty because of a
strained right calf muscle. Gonzalez said the injury has been
affecting his hitting, although he fooled people Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you feel bad but still hit the ball good,'' Gonzalez
said. ``Tonight I hit the ball very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven RBI in a game fell one short of his club record of
eight, set in 1993 against the California Angels. He has 143 this
season, also one short of his club record, but there's plenty of
time to exceed that mark. Gonzalez is the first player since
Boston's Vern Stephens in 1949 to have at least 140 RBI by the end
of August.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers set a club record Monday night. The home runs by
Gonzalez and Roberto Kelly, his sixth in his past 12 games, gave
the Rangers 45 home runs in August, the most for one month in club
history.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez got started in the first inning with a bases-loaded,
two-run double off the left-field wall. He added a two-run double
in the second, a two-run homer in the fourth (a 450-foot blast into
the second deck of the left-field bleachers) and a run-scoring
triple to deep right-center in the sixth. Gonzalez is 8-for-8
lifetime against Florie with five doubles, two home runs, a triple
and 12 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw four different pitches and he hit all four,'' Florie
said. ``He did his job and I didn't do mine. I think I'm going to
throw my glove at him next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's chance for the cycle came in the eighth, but not
against Florie. Instead he faced Tigers rookie reliever Matt
Anderson, whose fastball has been clocked at 99 to 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to him in the dugout,'' Oates said. ``We told him,
don't make a farce of it, but if there's any chance, hold at first
for the single. Just don't make a joke of it and just don't show up
the Tigers. How many cycles have there been?''
</P>
<P>
   Oddibe McDowell had the only one in Rangers history, in 1985.
Gonzalez worked the count to 3-1 and flared one to short right,
where Higginson disappointed everybody by making the catch.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd also booed Mike Simms in the ninth. The Rangers scored
three runs that inning and Gonzalez was on deck when Simms grounded
out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying for the cycle,'' Gonzalez said. ``But I still
feel very happy. This is an important series. We need to continue
to win ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers pounded Tigers for 14 hits and Esteban Loaiza took
advantage of the offensive support with eight strong innings,
limiting the Tigers to six hits. Excellent defense from shortstop
Royce Clayton, second baseman Luis Alicea and left fielder Rusty
Greer allowed him to take a shutout into the eighth before Tony
Clark and Luis Gonzalez hit back-to-back home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty solid effort all around,'' first baseman Will
Clark said. ``Needless to say, Juan had the big night, but it was a
very good game overall. Esteban threw a lot of strikes, the defense
_ especially Royce, Luis and Rusty _ was fantastic and a lot of
guys got on in front of Juan.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez took it from there.

ATLANTA _ Knock them on their backs, kick them in the face, leave
them for dead.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you think you have the Astros right where you want
them, you don't.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves had every reason to think the Astros were
ready to succumb to another pitching gem by John Smoltz. Then, the
Braves got tomahawked as the Astros claimed a telling 4-3
come-from-behind victory Monday night at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scratched out two hits and an unearned run in the
first eight innings but banged out three runs on six singles in a
ninth-inning comeback. These hardly resembled the Astros who were
shoved around Turner Field on their last visit _ Games 1 and 2 of a
three-game Division Series sweep last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts a signal ahead that it ain't going to be easy like
it was last year,'' Astros right fielder Derek Bell said. ``This
year, we're coming to take some heads off. You can't take us
lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell and Moises Alou drove in runs in the ninth before
Brad Ausmus struck the final blow with a clutch two-out single off
closer Kerry Ligtenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner pitched a scoreless ninth for his 26th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pressure, but it was the best kind of pressure,''
Wagner said. ``Our guys gutted it out for nine innings to get me
into the game. You want every save you can get, but those are the
games you really want to save.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who have come from behind to win their last three
games, have won 11 of their last 13 to get within three games of
the Braves for the best record in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton started and pitched well enough to win but wasn't
around for the decision. Reliever Jay Powell (5-5) was credited
with the win despite allowing a home run by Chipper Jones in his
only inning.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, wasn't at his best, but when the Astros' offense starts
clicking, a pitcher doesn't have to be.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio, Bill Spiers, Bell, Bagwell and Alou opened the
ninth with consecutive singles before Ligtenberg finally got an out
_ on a bullet to center by Carl Everett. After Ricky Gutierrez
struck out, Ausmus came through.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was clearly the best clutch hitting and the best at-bats
you could ever imagine,'' said manager Larry Dierker, who watched
his team win in its last at-bat for the 23rd time. ``I'd like to
get a lead and stay ahead every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, we didn't play a very good game. We made some
mistakes in the field, and our baserunning could have been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you play with great virtuosity, sometimes you can
overcome mistakes. I wasn't real happy with the way we played up
until the point we took the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   The euphoric victory looked like a hard-luck loss in the seventh
inning when the Braves broke a 1-1 tie on one of the wackiest plays
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Andruw Jones was at second base and Ryan Klesko at first with no
one out. Smoltz missed a bunt attempt, Ausmus threw to shortstop
Gutierrez, and Jones broke for third and beat Gutierrez's throw.
</P>
<P>
   Then Spiers fired back to second, and Gutierrez, after looking
toward Jones, ran after Klesko, who was caught between first and
second.
</P>
<P>
   The result could not have been worse: Jones scored, his second
stolen base of the play, and Klesko got back to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at him (Jones) and running Klesko back to first
at the same time,'' Gutierrez said. ``I wanted to throw home, but I
lost him (Jones) for a minute. By the time I threw to first, it was
too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have lost the game, that would have been a big
part of it. But that just shows the heart of this team. We don't
give up until it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Ausmus' ninth-inning hit was his first of the game but was
certainly one of his biggest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last inning was a team effort,'' Ausmus said. ``Everyone
pitched in with a single. This was a big win for us in the sense of
how well he (Smoltz) had pitched against us for the first eight
innings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took an early lead on Javy Lopez's third homer
against the Astros this season. This one was a line-drive solo shot
off Hampton in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz (13-3) took a no-hitter to the fourth before Spiers'
leadoff single, a botched double-play attempt and Alou's single to
right tied the game at 1.
</P>
<P>
   But Smoltz was untouchable over the next four innings, and the
Braves appeared to have the game safely tucked in the win column
with the strange run in the seventh and Chipper Jones' homer off
Powell in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dominated for eight innings,'' Chipper Jones said.
``This is a tough one to swallow, and it puts more emphasis on the
next two.''

 FranBlineburyc. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ With the Titanic video now on sale, the lines will
probably wrap around the block. It's just amazing how many times
some people will watch the same old story, even when it always ends
up with the iceberg winning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So there were the Astros, rearranging deck chairs at Turner
Field while the band played Nearer My God to Thee and John Smoltz
played them like a fiddle. Two hits and one unearned run through
eight innings, and the picture looked bluer than Leonardo DiCaprio
in the last reel.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the Braves do. They wear you down with pitching
that is finer than the edge on a scalpel and produce just enough
offense to let you think you have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Except these Astros always do have a chance. Down to the final
inning and the final out and the final pitch.
</P>
<P>
   They are the party guests who are still dancing in the living
room after you've turned off the lights and gone to bed.
</P>
<P>
   So what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   Six hits in the ninth inning. More singles than a computer
dating service.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, another two-run deficit turns into a 4-3 win
over the Braves and, yes, it's the same old story. But with a whole
new twist this season.
</P>
<P>
   We could say it was a dramatic victory. But where is the drama,
the edge-of-your-seat thrill, the suspense, when you know the
Astros are always going to find a way. Some way.
</P>
<P>
   They have come from behind 41 times in this increasingly amazing
season. They have won 23 times in their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to say that something like this is ever
routine,'' said manager Larry Dierker. ``You can never predict that
things like this are going to happen. But the more it happens, the
more you come to believe that you are always going to have a
chance. I'll tell you this: I didn't think that Smoltz was going to
have an easy time getting through that ninth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   And he didn't. It was like being a victim of water torture.
Drip, drip, drip.
</P>
<P>
   First a single to right by Craig Biggio, then a smash by Bill
Spiers off Smoltz. Derek Bell singled to load the bases, and that
was the end for Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the end for the Astros. Jeff Bagwell greeted Kerry
Ligtenberg with an at-bat that was dogged, ferocious. Twice, he
fought off and fouled off 3-2 pitches. Then, he stroked a single to
left that cut the lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Moises Alou followed with another single, the game was tied, and
Ligtenberg had to feel like he was standing in the center of a
pinwheel, watching Astros spinning around him.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett lined out to center, and Ricky Gutierrez struck
out. Then Brad Ausmus, overmatched at the plate all night, added
his single to the collection. And after Billy Wagner handled the
bottom of the ninth, another comeback had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Dierker noticed something about his own team. He
watched the way his players reacted on the field after the final
out. He looked to see if there was any exuberant celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was thinking back to a year ago in the playoffs, when
Darryl Kile pitched a gorgeous two-hitter right here and the Braves
still found a way to win 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no jumping around,'' Dierker recalled of the Braves.
``They just walked out and shook hands. Ho-hum. They had come to
expect that they'd win. That's the mark of a confident team, a
truly good team.''
</P>
<P>
   A mark that appears to be on the Astros now. Never mind solo
homers by Javy Lopez and Chipper Jones or some sloppy defense that
allowed Andruw Jones to steal third and home in the seventh inning.
They'll find a way. Some way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, a 3-1 lead in the ninth is a gimmie,'' Chipper Jones
said. ``That ought to give them a big lift. They were down in the
eighth inning. That's a tough one for us to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially knowing that even if the Braves square the series
tonight, they have to go through Randy Johnson on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we came here for the playoffs and we were untested,
unproven, even to ourselves,'' Ausmus said. ``And they did what
they were supposed to do. They kicked our butt. Did it fast. Never
gave us a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're back and we don't have to prove anything. They know
who we are. They know how good we are. They can't take anything for
granted. It's all different.''
</P>
<P>
   Better stand in line at the video store. Make sure the ship
still sinks.

SMU QUARTERBACK INTELLIGENT, TOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having successfully traversed the slippery slopes of Division
I-A football as a redshirt freshman last season, Chris Sanders felt
he was up for a bigger challenge.
</P>
<P>
   So, on a winter skiing trip, he sailed down a slope and hit a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach kind of threw a fit,'' he said, recalling the aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say that SMU coach Mike Cavan's reaction _ verging
on apoplexy _ was fairly normal for a football coach who has
discovered that his starting quarterback has a broken foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ... had a discussion about it, and agreed that it won't
happen again,'' Cavan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll say one thing _ you got to admire the kid's
toughness. He flat demolished the tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who weighs ``about 212 to 215'' after dropping 20
pounds off his 6-foot frame, described the victim as being ``really
just a very large bush. I was snowboarding and my board just took
off and I sailed through the tree and wound up down in a ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   The break, fortunately, was in a small bone on the outside of
the foot, and it healed in time for spring drills. Sanders, who led
SMU in passing (678 yards, six TDs) while splitting time with Ramon
Flanigan last season, is sound of mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has intellectually meshed with the offense installed
by new coordinator Greg Briner, and is prepared to lead the
Mustangs on a 12-game quest for success. With Flanigan gone and
Sanders in the starting role, the Mustangs will throw more and rely
less on the option.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still the I-formation, but this version is more like a
pro-style attack,'' he said. ``The basic philosophy is still the
same, but there are a few more choices about accomplishing our
objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's a thinking offense, and that's what I like most
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It does not mean that Sanders will approach the achievements of
his senior year at Flower Mound Marcus High School, when his
passing yardage (4,285) was the fourth-highest prep total recorded
nationally. But he does feel that he and his teammates stand on the
threshold of a new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not satisfied with the season I had last year,'' he
said. ``I got a lot of playing time, but I was in a learning
process and it was kind of up and down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I played in pressure games and I think I matured some, and
I would really like for this season to be sort of my `coming-out'
year. I think that with this offense and greater confidence, I can
be a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm also learning a lot now about what Ramon went through last
year, when he was the returning starter being pushed by a freshman.
Now I'm the starter, and I'm being pushed by a freshman, Josh
McCown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, I think that situation was good for the team last
year, because Ramon and I both responded pretty well, and I think
the same will be true this year with Josh and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavan said Sanders' mental approach to the game is one of his
greatest strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris is definitely a student of the game, and that is a
constant plus,'' Cavan said. ``He's the consummate gym rat, always
trying to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not very fast and he's not very tall, but he has this
great attitude about wanting to get things done. He's got the
mental approach and the work ethic, and I admire him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   It kind of runs in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sanders' senior year at Marcus, his mother, Debbie,
learned she had Hodgkin's disease. Initially, Sanders planned to
quit football so he could spend more time with her _ but she
promptly squelched that idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wouldn't let me quit, because she knew how much it meant
to me,'' he said. ``She wouldn't hear of it, and there was also no
question about my coming here. She definitely made sure of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease is in remission, and Sanders' mother has taken on a
new vocation: guarding against the spread of anemia by cooking for
her son's teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly the offensive linemen,'' he said. ``They eat a lot
_ they'll eat anything _ and I have an interest in seeing that
they're happy, because those are the guys that protect me in a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   In gratitude, his teammates have given Sanders a nickname:
``Snacks.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, having participated in a turnaround in 1997 that
produced the program's first winning season (6-5) since 1986,
Sanders and his mates are ready for a brave new world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see us as a kind of young-blood type team, with almost all
of the guys associated with the post-death penalty being gone
now,'' he said. ``We're not carrying that with us anymore, and we
can just look to the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might say that we took part in the revolution _ now we
need a war to win. Just having a winning season isn't enough
anymore, we can accomplish more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, however, has matured enough to avoid rash predictions
of blazing glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``About the only thing I'll guarantee,'' he said, grinning, ``is
that we'll definitely play 12 games.''

METS BEAT DODGERS, 8-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Had he chosen to, Mike Piazza could have sat out
the New York Mets' 8-3 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers on
Monday night. The All-Star catcher had taken a foul ball off his
right shoulder in the first inning of Sunday night's loss and then
removed himself from the game after the inning was over. His
shoulder was still smarting when he came to the ball park on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But this was Piazza's last game at Dodger Stadium this season,
the Mets are in the middle of the race for the National League wild
card, and the Cubs had won in Chicago earlier on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   So Piazza, who was again greeted with boos that were washed away
by cheers, played. He smacked a run-scoring double into the
left-field corner in the first inning and then a lined a
run-scoring single to right in the third to power Rick Reed to his
16th victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite an extended homecoming weekend for Piazza, who went
8 for 13 with 3 runs, 3 runs batted in, 2 doubles and a homer as
the Mets took 3 of 4 from the team that traded Piazza to Florida in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza went 3 for 4 on Monday night with 2 rbi, and in his last
seven games, he is 13 for 21 (.619). He has five homers and 14 rbi
in his last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   The surge cannot come at a better time for the Mets (76-62).
They are tied with the Cubs for the wild-card berth as they head to
San Diego for a two-game set beginning on Tuesday night with the
N.L. West leader.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, the league's top hitter when the day began, doubled
off Chan Ho Park (11-8) with two out in the first inning and scored
on Piazza's double. After Edgardo Alfonzo and Olerud walked with
two out in the third, Piazza's opposite-field single came on Park's
first pitch to him.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets gave Reed (16-8) another run to work with in the
fourth. Lenny Harris led off with a single, stole second with a
nice slide to elude shortstop Mark Grudzielanek's tag and then
scored on Rey Ordonez's one-out single to left.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, meanwhile, had pitched his way out of jams in both the
second and third. The Dodgers rallied for a run in the fourth to
make it 3-1 on Bobby Bonilla's ground-rule double, Matt Luke's
groundout and Grudzielanek's sacrifice fly, for which Brian McRae
slid to catch in short center. McRae nearly threw Bonilla out at
the plate, too.
</P>
<P>
   After Olerud singled with two out in the fifth, Piazza walked
and McRae singled Olerud home, and Reed had a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who had admitted to being a little arm-weary after he was
tagged for seven runs and two homers in a 7-3 loss in San Francisco
six days earlier, did not allow a homer on Monday night. But he did
begin to tire in the seventh, walking Los Angeles' No. 8 hitter,
Tom Prince, to open the inning. Roger Cedeno, pinch-hitting for
Park, then drilled a run-scoring double off the fence in
right-center field to pull the Dodgers within 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   That was all for Reed after 107 pitches; he had allowed nine
hits and three runs in six-plus innings, walking one and striking
out six.
</P>
<P>
   On came Turk Wendell. Cedeno later scored on a one-out groundout
by Jim Eisenreich. But after Raul Mondesi walked and stole second
(the ball popping out of Carlos Baerga's glove), Eric Karros
grounded out. And the Mets still had a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It grew a run when Harris belted his fourth homer of the year in
the eighth off reliever Mike Judd. And the Mets put the game away
in a three-run ninth that featured a run-scoring single by Alfonzo
and a two-run single by McRae sandwiched around Piazza's third hit.

OKLAHOMA LINEMAN HOPING TO MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pain that struck without warning on that hot summer
afternoon some 14 months ago as Jay Smith jogged around the
Oklahoma practice field was like nothing he had ever felt before,
and something he has had a hard time forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like someone had shot me in the back of the foot or
hit me with a baseball bat,'' recalled the Sooners' offensive
lineman from Arlington Lamar. ``I thought someone had kicked me. I
turned and no one was behind me. But when I fell, I knew I had
pulled something.''
</P>
<P>
   The Achilles' tendon in Smith's left foot had snapped, to be
more gruesomely precise. It is an injury that sometimes is the
beginning of the end of an athletic career. Compounding the
situation, Smith tore the same tendon in a different place nine
weeks later as he rehabilitated the initial injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my second surgery, I sat back and looked at it,'' Smith
said. ``I decided that though this could have been a career-ending
injury, that I could come back from it and play again _ even though
coming back from two Achilles' tears in such a short period of time
is unheard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's quest _ a return to past glory _ coincides with that of
the Sooners. In a search for a formula to return the program to
those thrilling days of yesteryear, OU coach John Blake has
(re)turned to the wishbone, a formation under which former coach
Barry Switzer (1973-88) assembled one of college football's most
feared offenses through much of two decades.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of his decision, Blake says he is at peace as
detractors snap at his heels at the beginning of only his third
season as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I'm most comfortable is that we've got a
quarterback (junior Brandon Daniels) who can run an offense we all
believe in,'' Blake said. ``The type of offense we're running has
all the kids excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, backs De'Mond Parker and Jermaine ``Jumbo'' Fazande are
key ingredients as OU bids for its first winning season since 1993.
But, as line coach Sam Pittman said, ``There's no question a big
part of our destiny is going to ride on the offensive line.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Smith, a senior who hasn't played since
starting nine games as a redshirt sophomore in 1996, hopes he comes
in. Despite his competitive inactivity _ including no spring
training _ the 6-foot-4, 290-pound Smith worked his way during
August into the No. 2 slot at left guard behind 300-pound Pilot
Point sophomore Adam Carpenter, who is regarded as one of OU's
better linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said he believes Smith experienced a recent
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably about the middle of (the week before last), I think
Jay finally decided that (the tendon) was strong enough,'' Pittman
said. ``I think if not consciously, then subconsciously he was
thinking about it. But he has played well since the latter part of
that week and has followed it with good scrimmages.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's starting to come into his own. He's bigger and stronger
than he was when he got hurt, and I think he'll be back to where he
was pretty soon. It's been very pleasant to see him progess. We're
definitely going to count on him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of evaluation the determined Smith likes to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've worked my way back into the rotation,'' he
said. ``And as the season goes on, I will be starting. I'm
confident of that. No one's going to beat me out. I'm not worried
about (Carpenter). He's got plenty of time. I don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked very hard the last 11 months. Coming out of high
school I was one of the top players in the country. I want to get
back playing like I used to be able to. ''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum stood there in
his familiar aw-shucks stance, flashing that toothy grin and
running his hand through all the locks of gray hair that
glory-starved Aggies fans have given him over the years.
</P>
<P>
   What the heck, he said. Why not give it a shot against Florida
State? He said he was in the business of teaching young men to be
bold. Why not take this game and the long odds that went with it?
He said there was nothing to lose against the No. 2-ranked team in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. But in the end, there was nothing to gain, either.
Not a smidgen. And if you are an Aggies fan, that should be
disheartening news.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game that put no more gray hairs on Slocum's head but
wasn't exactly Grecian Formula, either. This was a game that showed
the nation that the Aggies indeed are no better than a top-10
wannabe, but no worse.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies came out on a Monday night under the lights, bouncing
around like they were ready to do something big, waving their arms
and not backing down a bit from the powerful Seminoles. They looked
every bit like a team that was ready for some football.
</P>
<P>
   They gave it a shot. They were bold _ a reverse here, a few nice
tosses upfield there, linebacker Dat Nguyen everywhere. They were,
at times, pretty good against a great team.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, this game had such a disturbingly familiar plot,
not just to the UCLA Cotton Bowl game of last season but to the
1988 Kickoff Classic, when the once-sleeping Aggies first believed
they were ready to make the big jump to the elite.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't ready then. They aren't ready now.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game that just as well could have had Lance Pavlas,
not Branndon Stewart, looking for room in the opposing secondary.
It just as well could have had Darren Lewis and Randy Simmons, not
Dante Hall and Sirr Parker, trying to find inches of running room
against a bigger and better line.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the ghost of Jimmy Hoffa roaming Giants Stadium.
That was the memory of Jackie Sherrill.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, it was the glory-starved Aggies taking on No. 2
Nebraska in the Kickoff Classic. The final score was 23-14, brutes.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, it was the glory-starved Aggies taking on No. 2
Florida State in the Kickoff Classic. The final score was 23-14,
brutes.
</P>
<P>
   This game proved only that the Aggies waited 10 years to come
back to the Big Apple, only to realize they haven't gone anywhere.
The A&AMP;M shortcomings today are the same they were a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   They need to _ haven't you heard this before? _ find some power
up the middle offensively, locate a couple of defensive linemen who
can pressure the opposing quarterback without the help of a blitz,
and look for depth everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Getting one of those Peter Warrick guys wouldn't be a bad idea,
either. Neither would it be a bad thing to get one or two of those
Travis Minors.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick and Minor were the most brilliant parts of FSU's
offensive arsenal, which in the first half picked at the hustling
A&AMP;M defense and in the second half picked on it.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles briefly had a worried look on their faces in the
first half, when the Aggies went Wrecking Crew on them.
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen, who could play on my team any day of the week, or
probably even Bobby Bowden's for that matter, led the early charge.
A huge hit on FSU quarterback Chris Weinke by A&AMP;M's Christian
Rodriguez and the ensuing fumble return for a touchdown by Jay
Brooks late in the second quarter actually gave the Aggies a 14-10
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the second-half numbers were a landslide, with the Seminoles
treating A&AMP;M like just another Wake Forest or Duke, outgaining the
Aggies 190-20 and sending them home still winless against top-five
teams under Slocum.
</P>
<P>
   The count now is 0-7. It has been so long since the Aggies won
such a game, the crewcuts their Corps members like to wear have
gone out of style and come back in again.
</P>
<P>
   After their latest try, the best Bowden could say about the
Aggies was that ``they were scrappy.''
</P>
<P>
   And they were. They were scrappy, just like 10 years ago. But
after 10 years, scrappy should be disheartening.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he was proud of his team and that there still was
time to build, to ``take this and drive on from here. We can
develop into a good football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like what Sherrill said after the Nebraska game a decade
ago.

FLORIDA STATE TOPS TEXAS A&AMP;M, 23-14 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Their mature quarterback looked as if he
had been shagging baseballs in the minor leagues. Their junior wide
receiver validated all the hopeful Heisman talk coming from
Tallahassee. But ultimately it was a sure-footed field goal kicker
who helped the Florida State Seminoles outlast Texas A&AMP;M, 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   The 59,232 on hand at Giants Stadium for the 16th annual Kickoff
Classic witnessed an old-fashioned Southern brawl, which the
underdog Aggies were winning until very, very deep into the third
quarter. But, finally, the team ranked No. 2 in preseason polls of
both coaches and the news media wore down the Aggies, though not
with its usual explosive flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some mistakes, but I'm relieved we got out of this
one,'' Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden said. ``We came in here
with more unproven parts than we've had in the last five years, but
I like what we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies showed they were a worthy test, demonstrating some
heroic efforts on defense that first allowed them to reverse an
early 10-0 deficit and then gave their offense a chance to win the
game. In the fourth quarter, Dat Nguyen, the all-American and
Butkus award candidate, recorded nine solo tackles and
single-handedly stopped two Florida State touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   First, he stripped the ball from quarterback Chris Weinke, who
was starting his first football game after six years in the minor
leagues for the Toronto Blue Jays, inside the Aggies' 20-yard line.
Then he stuffed Travis Minor at the goal line on a third-and-1,
forcing Sebastian Janikowski to kick his third field goal of the
night from 22 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept rising to the occasion, and this is going to help us
down the road,'' Nguyen said. ``It shows we got a lot of heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen and the rest of the Aggie defense made the 26-year-old
Weinke's return to football painful and frustrating. But the old
quarterback kept going to his junior receiver Peter Warrick,
perhaps the finest receiver in the nation, and finally, with five
seconds left in the third quarter, found him for the go-ahead
touchdown on a critical third down, giving Florida State a 20-14
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just came back to the ball,'' said Warrick who caught 9
passes for 106 yards and was named the game's most valuable player.
``I have a lot of confidence in Chris, and I knew he would find
me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminole offense amassed 360 yards but sputtered at critical
times. Earlier in the third quarter, it had to settle for a
Janikowski field goal from 28 yards after marching 68 yards in 12
plays before stalling at the A&AMP;M 9-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, who finished 21 of 36 for 207 yards, took the blame for
the dead spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rushed some things,'' he said. ``I give myself an A-plus for
leadership, but only a C for execution.''
</P>
<P>
   But on third-and-6 on the A&AMP;M 9-yard line, Warrick curled back
in the middle of the end zone to grab Weinke's bullet on the 3-yard
line in front of cornerback Jason Webster, and then danced around
him for the score and the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why we're a good team is because we are confident we can score
at any time,'' said Minor, who carried 34 times for 146 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The first half didn't unfold at all to form. The running team,
Texas A&AMP;M, passed, and the passing team, Florida State, ran. The
Aggies' talented trio of Dante Hall, D'Andre Hardeman and Sirr
Parker, who combined for more than 2,200 yards rushing last year,
managed only 61 yards for the whole game. So it was up to
quarterback Branndon Stewart, who went 10 for 21 for 100 yards, to
march the Aggies down the field, which he did brilliantly,
especially on a 45-yard touch pass to split end Chris Cole to set
up A&AMP;M's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida State capitalized on two early A&AMP;M turnovers. The
Seminoles took advantage of Stewart's fumbled snap to get on the
board first when safety Troy Saunders scooped up the ball on A&AMP;M's
39-yard line with 9 minutes 35 seconds left in the first quarter.
Eight plays later, Minor scored from 3 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After the kickoff, Parker snuffed out a promising A&AMP;M drive when
he fumbled after a 4-yard gain, and the ball was smothered by
linebacker Tommy Polley. Florida State turned the opportunity into
a 33-yard field goal by Janikowski.
</P>
<P>
   Swarming defense was responsible for the Aggies' go-ahead score.
Linebacker Christian Rodriguez and cornerback Jay Brooks _ both
redshirt freshmen playing their first collegiate games _ teamed up
on the biggest play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke dropped back to pass on his own 22-yard line and was
blindsided by Rodriguez, popping the ball straight up in the air.
It bounced once, then Brooks scooped it up and scooted 21 yards
into the end zone. Suddenly, A&AMP;M was in control of the game, 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their defense put it to us,'' Bowden said. ``We were lucky to
get out.''  &QL;

METS BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The final month begins with Gary Sheffield in a
cast and the Dodgers drifting out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   Before Monday's 8-3 loss to the New York Mets in front of 37,806
at Dodger Stadium, the club lost its All-Star right-fielder for at
least two weeks and perhaps the season after spraining his left
ankle the night before.
</P>
<P>
   Team orthopedist Frank Jobe called the sprain, suffered in a
seventh-inning rundown play, ``severe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a lot longer, but we're saying a week for now,''
Jobe said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has missed five games since joining the team May
15, told teammates it is going to be a while.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield's return might depend on the Dodgers spot in the
wild-card race. The loss to the Mets dropped them eight games back
with 24 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also lost setup man Antonio Osuna, who learned
Monday he will need season-ending surgery on his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   But with the race all but over, there might not be any reason
for Sheffield to come back in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the five games without Sheffield this season, the Dodgers
(68-70) have averaged 2.4 runs, and Monday was no different.
</P>
<P>
   They got three runs in seven innings against Mets starter Jeff
Reed (16-8), but the Mets scored a run in six different innings,
including four runs against Dodgers starter Chan Ho Park (11-8).
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers were featured all night for the the Mets,
including Mike Piazza, who drove in the Mets first two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza left Sunday's game after taking a foul ball off his right
shoulder but returned with three hits and a walk.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the four-game series 8 for 13 with one homer, but it
was another former Dodger, Lenny Harris, who put the game away with
an eighth-inning homer off Mike Judd.
</P>
<P>
   Judd, who entered the game with just eight runs in five
appearance, moved up the bullpen chart Monday when Osuna found out
he is facing season-ending elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets added three more runs in the ninth that included an RBI
single by Edgardo Alfonzo, who won Saturday's game with a home run.
Brian McRae capped the scoring with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers went with their hottest starter, Park, who had lost
just once since June 21.
</P>
<P>
   But after striking out the first two batters, Park allowed a
double to John Olerud and another to Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was at it again in the third with an RBI single that
scored Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Harris made it 3-0 in the fourth when he opened with a single,
stole second and scored on a single by Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who had a 2-1 complete-game victory over the Dodgers on
Aug. 1 at Shea Stadium, continued his mastery until the fourth
inning, when Bobby Bonilla opened with a double and scored on a
sacrifice fly by Mark Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   For Bonilla, who has struggled all year with wrist and Achilles
injuries, it was his seventh hit on the homestand, including two
homers and three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla has hit safely in seven straight games, batting .400 in
that span, and has reached base in his past 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers didn't really get to Reed until the seventh.
Reserve catcher Tom Prince, starting a second consecutive game in
place of Charles Johnson (stiff right shoulder), opened with a
walk.
</P>
<P>
   Park was lifted for pinch hitter Roger Cedeno, who came in tied
with Jim Eisenreich for the club lead with seven pinch hits.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno doubled to the gap in right-center to score Prince and
cut the Mets lead to 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Turk Wendell replaced Reed, but Cedeno made it a one-run game
when he moved to third on Eric Young's infield out and scored on
Eisenreich's infield out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets appeared headed for more trouble when Wendell
intentionally walked Raul Mondesi. This is the same Mondesi that
has walked just four times in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who left Sunday's game after taking a foul ball off the
right shoulder, was a good target to run on.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's throw beat Mondesi, but second baseman Carlos Baerga
dropped the ball. But the Dodgers couldn't capitalize. Karros
grounded out to end the inning.

WEINKE PASSES FIRST TEST AT AGE 26 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Florida State came here on Monday night,
to the Kickoff Classic, lugging lofty expectations and saddled with
high anxiety. Much of it centered on the team's 26-year-old
sophomore quarterback, Chris Weinke.
</P>
<P>
   The grand expectations are in place, but some of the jitters
about Weinke were relieved during the Seminoles' 23-14 victory over
Texas A&AMP;M. Weinke, who was starting his first game since he left
high school nine years ago, steadied himself after a shaky start
and grabbed control of the team. He got a major lift from running
back Travis Minor, who had a team-record 34 carries for 146 yards,
and receiver Peter Warrick, who was named the game's most valuable
player after catching 9 passes for 106 yards and 1 touchdown, and
returning 3 punts for 56 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the anticipation is better than the realization,''
Weinke said. ``But in this case, the realization was just as good
as the anticipation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Kendra, the projected starter, injured his knee in the
spring game, Weinke moved up to starter. It was an up-and-down
debut for Weinke as he completed 21 of 36 attempts for 207 yards
and 1 touchdown, and lost 2 fumbles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden of the Seminoles said Weinke performed as
well as he expected. ``He could have been a bust because he's never
done anything on the field,'' Bowden said. ``But he did very well.
I feel good about what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Weinke's biggest accomplishment was that he gained the
respect of the team and established his leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in control from the first play to the last play,''
Minor said. ``When things weren't running smoothly, he kept his
composure. That's what makes a great quarterback, a guy who can
keep the offense together when the offense isn't running
smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years of minor league baseball helped Weinke develop his
poise. He was drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays out of Cretin-Derham
High School in St. Paul, and chose the minor league life and a
$400,000 signing bonus over a football scholarship to Florida
State. He spent six years in the Blue Jays organization, but never
managed to advance beyond the Class A level. Bowden had always left
the door open for Weinke to return to Tallahassee. Two years ago,
Weinke took him up on that offer after his desire to play baseball
dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   The two fumbles on Monday night tempered Weinke's debut. One
occurred at the Aggies' 14-yard line when he was stripped while
trying to pick up a first down with the Seminoles clinging to a
20-14 lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M could not do anything with that turnover, and then
Warrick gave Weinke an opportunity to redeem himself by returning
the Aggies' punt 32 yards. A 5-yard penalty gave Florida State the
ball at the Texas A&AMP;M 24. The result was a 22-yard field goal by
kicker Sebastian Janikowski, which made it 23-14 with 3 minutes 26
seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, a second-team all-Atlantic Coast Conference selection
last year as a sophomore with 53 receptions for 884 yards and 8
touchdowns (16.7 yards a catch), offered glimpses of Florida
State's big-play potential on offense. He was Weinke's favorite
target.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick's touchdown reception came just minutes after Texas A&AMP;M
cornerback Sedrick Curry rolled up on his right leg following an
overthrown pass in the end zone. Warrick limped off the field. He
returned two plays later to catch a touchdown pass from Weinke _ a
9-yard scoring reception that Warrick caught 3 yards in front of
the end zone and then curled around two defenders to go in
untouched for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to make something out of nothing,'' Warrick
said. &QL;

ASIAN MARKETS REACT TO WALL STREET JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subbing 3rd graf for updating and deleting 4th graf) (js) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Stock prices cascaded around the region on Tuesday in
response to the deep plunge on Wall Street, spreading anxiety over
a possible global slowdown that could fan greater financial
instability in Asia and quash any hopes for an economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Asia has always been sensitive to jitters on Wall Street, but it
has been particularly vulnerable recently as local economies are
registering their largest economic contractions in years, even
decades for some countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Nikkei index of 225 shares dove at the opening to a new
12-year low of 13,664.74, down 442.15, or 3.1 percent from Monday's
close. Prices rebounded later, to 14,124.13. Stock prices also fell
1.99 percent, to 839.35, in Singapore, partly on news that the
Malaysian government suspended trading in shares on Monday. The
Malaysian government also said it would not recognize share trading
of Malaysian shares in Singapore. It also imposed controls on its
currency, the ringgit, restricting its conversion into other
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a free fall, isn't it?'' said Patrick Mohr, a strategist
at Merrill Lynch Japan Ltd. in Tokyo. Referring to the Tokyo stock
market, he added: ``This looks like a reaction to Wall Street in
the short term. In the long term, there's just a lot of uncertainty
about the fate of the financial system.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, a senior economic official warned that Japan would
have economic difficulty over the next few months, suggesting that
even with a multibillion economic stimulus package in the works
that growth might still be elusive to the world's second-largest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The one bright spot for the region was the yen, which
strengthened against the dollar to about 139 yen to the dollar.
Investors sold dollars after the fall on Wall Street, and Japanese
officials immediately seized upon this, saying that the yen might
be on a strengthening trend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There is a chance of a very rapid dollar weakening and yen
strengthening,'' said Haruhiko Kuroda, a senior official at the
Japanese Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the stronger yen, stocks in South Korea also held
steady. A stronger yen means that Japanese exports become more
expensive, leaving room for Korean exports to outbid their Japanese
competitors. A stronger yen also helps stabilize export markets in
the region, reducing the chances that Asian exporters engage in a
competitive bidding war.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the market in Tokyo appeared to be collapsing, some
investors said that the low levels could force the government to
bring about change. Japan is pivotal in the Asian region, and if
leaders here can bring about an economic recovery, there may be
dividends throughout Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market pressure is the only catalyst to shock the
Japanese bureaucrats into making the difficult decisions necessary
to restore confidence,'' said Mohr at Merrill Lynch.

 F STATE-TEXAS A&AMP;M 
Florida St .  gets second wind  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Mark Blaudschun  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Bobby Bowden was concerned. Not by what
he had seen in the first half of Monday night's Kickoff Classic
between his second-ranked Florida State team and No. 14 Texas A&AMP;M.
But by what he thought he might see in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   What many had thought would be another opening-game romp for FSU
turned into something much more serious _ a potential loss that
would have been an immediate blow to the Seminoles' national
championship hopes.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Seminoles usually do when faced with a crisis, they
responded just fine, coming out in the second half with intensity
as they pulled away to a 23-14 victory before 59,232 at Giants
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, I didn't know what to expect,'' said Bowden,
whose team trailed, 14-10, at halftime. ``(The Aggies) were playing
good football. They were scrappy and they fought us to the end. I
said to myself, `We're just going to see how we react. Would we
panic?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden had reason for uncertainty. Not only was his team 64
percent freshmen and sophomores, but his starting quarterback was
one of those sophomores, albeit one with an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weinke was, indeed, starting his first collegiate game.
But he is also 26 and coming off six years of minor league baseball
experience in the Toronto Blue Jays organization. That gave the
6-foot-5-inch, 225-pound sophomore a sense of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing-wise, I felt I had an average game,'' said Weinke, who
hadn't started at quarterback since he was a high school senior in
1989. ``If you had to give a grade, it probably would be a C. But
in terms of leadership and taking control, I felt I deserved an
A-plus.''
</P>
<P>
   Weinke made some costly mistakes. So did the rest of the
Seminoles, who saw a 10-0 first-quarter lead turn into that 14-10
deficit. A busted defensive play set up A&AMP;M's first touchdown and a
fumble by Weinke, who was blindsided inside his own 25 in the final
minute of the half, not only caused a fumble but resulted in a
Texas A&AMP;M touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were behind at halftime and no one really expected that,''
said Weinke, whose debut stat line showed him completing 21 of 36
passes for 207 yards and a touchdown. ``It was a learning
experience for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Weinke more confident in the second half, making
better decisions and more accurate passes, but running back Travis
Minor (34 carries, 146 yards) and wide receiver Peter Warrick
(career-best 9 receptions for 106 yards and 1 TD) turned in
game-saving performances.
</P>
<P>
   Neither came as a surprise. Minor was the Atlantic Coast
Conference Rookie of the Year last season, while Warrick is an
All-America wideout.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the performance of the FSU defense stunning. Faced with
a challenge, it held Texas A&AMP;M to a total of 20 yards in the second
half, including only 5 on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M had that one big play,'' said FSU cornerback Tay Cody,
referring to a 48-yard pass from Brandon Stewart to Chris Cole that
set up the Aggies' first touchdown. ``Other than that, we had a
solid game.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the second half. The Seminoles set the tone for
the rest of the game when they stuffed the Aggies on their first
series of the third quarter. Weinke then started playing catch and
run with Warrick and Minor.
</P>
<P>
   Two drives turned into field goals by Sebastian Janikowski (who
also had one in the first quarter). Another ended in a nifty 9-yard
TD pass to Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of the fourth quarter, FSU had regained the lead at
20-14 and reestablished control of the game in a convincing
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to win,'' said Bowden. ``To come from behind
makes it even better. A 1-point win I would have taken.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They overpowered us,'' said Texas A&AMP;M's R.C. Slocum, joining a
long list of coaches who have seen the Seminoles do that year after
year.
</P>
<P>
   Last night just took a little longer than usual.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ College football's uppermost echelon was
close enough to see, to touch and, it seemed, to reach. Texas A&AMP;M
had climbed toward the most treacherous heights, scaling each rung
of that ladder more gracefully Monday night than most had thought
possible.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But when A&AMP;M again moved within a final step of joining that
level, this time represented by second-ranked Florida State in the
Kickoff Classic, it slipped and fell back toward the pack again.
</P>
<P>
   Following its now-familiar form, Texas A&AMP;M proved itself a
worthy challenger before Florida State pulled away for a 23-14 win
before 59,232 at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess any time you lose a game, it's a lost opportunity,''
A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said. ``I told the team there is a
significant difference between winning and losing. You can go play
and play well, lead at the half, whatever. There's only one deal:
You win or you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   And as with A&AMP;M's most recent defeat, to No. 5 UCLA in the
Cotton Bowl, the 14th-ranked Aggies led at halftime (14-10) only to
have their offense shut down and their defense eventually break
under the weight it was forced to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taking us such a long time,'' linebacker Dat Nguyen said
of the Aggies' quest to get a win that would push them into that
next level of the sport. ``We knew it was in our hands. And we let
it slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   So frustratingly familiar has become the form, the Aggies lost
by precisely the same score as the last time they came to New
Jersey to begin the season against the nation's second-ranked team.
Nebraska won that 1988 season opener, beginning the Aggies' quest
for a program-changing victory.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M has not beaten a top-five team away from Kyle Field since
1979, and since Slocum took over in 1989, A&AMP;M is 0-7 against
top-five teams and 2-10 against teams in the top 10, with both wins
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As has so often been the case, A&AMP;M's defense gave the Aggies a
chance, even scoring a go-ahead touchdown in the first half. But
the A&AMP;M offense was whipped in the second half, leaving the defense
stranded and eventually unable to win the game alone.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M managed just 20 second-half yards, minus-two rushing. When
Florida State took its 20-14 lead at the end of the third quarter,
A&AMP;M could pick up just one first down the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies' only offensive touchdown came largely off one long
play, a 45-yard pass from Branndon Stewart to Chris Cole to the
Florida State 13. The Aggies never again could end a drive inside
Florida State territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of the way the defense played,'' A&AMP;M safety Rich
Coady said. ``We played with a lot of effort. We never gave up.
Maybe next time, we'll catch some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Said A&AMP;M running back Sirr Parker, ``I thought the defense did a
hell of a job. (The offense) just needs to show up for the next
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies fulfilled the first part of their plan _ to stay in
the game and then try to find a way to steal it. But they wasted
all sorts of chances to either take far greater control or to at
least make things more difficult for Florida State to rally. And
they committed the sorts of turnovers they had said all summer they
could never afford in such a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought we'd get blown out of the stadium, but we
showed we have a good team,'' Nguyen said. ``But when you play a
big game, you can't make the mistakes we did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, Nguyen got his fingertips on a Chris Weinke
pass. And though it took all the leap he had to deflect the ball,
had he been able to come down with it, he would have had a 30-yard
walk to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, a Weinke pass required no leap, striking A&AMP;M
linebacker Roylin Bradley in the gut at the Florida State 40. But
Bradley was unable to reel the ball in, and the Seminoles added a
28-yard field goal to move within 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   And when Toya Jones missed a clear shot at Florida State's
player of the game, Peter Warrick, on a punt return, Warrick
returned the kick 21 yards to begin the drive in which he and the
Seminoles would regain their lead.
</P>
<P>
   Warrick, who caught nine passes for 106 yards, had to leave the
game and seemed unlikely to return, certainly to continue to
dominate. But just two plays after Warrick limped off, he cut in
front of Jason Webster and Coady, grabbed a Weinke dart at the two
and skipped into the end zone for a 20-14 FSU lead.
</P>
<P>
   And once Warrick's touchdown completed the Seminoles' first
sustained scoring drive of the game, Florida State continued to
move consistently.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles rolled for 11 plays to the A&AMP;M 16, failing to
score only when Nguyen slapped the ball from Weinke and A&AMP;M
freshman cornerback Jay Brooks recovered it.
</P>
<P>
   The next A&AMP;M drive went nowhere, with Florida State's David
Warren recognizing and stopping a reverse to Cole and disrupting a
Stewart pass. And after Warrick returned the next punt 32 yards,
the Seminoles ran eight plays before tacking on a 22-yard field
goal to put the Aggies out of range at 23-14.
</P>
<P>
   But though they did not mount much of a challenge in the second
half, the Aggies had led at halftime _ only Florida managed that
against the Seminoles last season _ and FSU's only scoring drives
were kick-started by A&AMP;M fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M came back from a 10-0 deficit, scoring touchdowns on a
one-yard run by D'Andre Hardeman after Cole's long reception and
when Christian Rodriguez smashed the ball loose from Weinke to hand
Brooks a 21-yard fumble return.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough to prove the Aggies' ability to challenge
Florida State. Defeating the Seminoles or their like, however,
remained one last large step out of reach.

HONG KONG'S MARKET DROPS AFTER GOVERNMENT PULLS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 5th graf with updated market figures) (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The Hong Kong government continued to play
cat-and-mouse with currency traders Monday _ abruptly withdrawing
from the stock market after it had feverishly intervened last week.
Without the government to prop up shares, Hong Kong's market
promptly plunged 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the magnitude of the decline, several analysts said the
market had not tumbled as much as they had expected. That may have
been a result of persistent rumors here Monday that the government
would begin buying shares again if the benchmark Hang Seng index
sank below 7,200.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of trading without Hong Kong's most prolific buyer,
the Hang Seng declined 554.7 points to close at 7,275.
</P>
<P>
   Some market experts said the stock market would have to fall
another 8 to 10 percent before it reflected a level free of any
artificial support. But given the Hong Kong government's
uncompromising stance toward the traders _ whom it accuses of
improperly manipulating both its currency and its stock market _
Monday's withdrawal was seen as nothing more than a tactical pause.
</P>
<P>
   [Shares fell 127.24 points in midday trading on Tuesday, or 1.75
percent, to 7,147.80, a rebound from earlier levels in the session
near 7000.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they just stepped away for a moment,'' said Marc
Faber, the head of his own investment advisory firm here. ``They
may have gotten cold feet when they realized that they weren't just
supporting Hong Kong. They were supporting Hong Kong against every
other market in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, last week's intervention enabled Hong Kong to buck a
worldwide swoon in financial markets. And Monday's sharp decline
only reinforced Hong Kong's contrarian bent, since Asia's largest
stock market, Japan, actually eked out a 1.4 percent increase.
Other Asian markets were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   But the deteriorating state of the global economy has made Hong
Kong's campaign to support its market extremely costly. Traders
estimate the government has spent between $12 billion and $15
billion on shares in the last two weeks _ more than half of that in
an extraordinary buying spree on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My honest opinion was that it would trade even lower,'' said
Glenn Lesko, the director of sales and trading at ABM Amro
Securities in Hong Kong. ``There have been so many detrimental
events around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with its vast foreign exchange fund _ worth roughly $97
billion _ most analysts said Hong Kong could not afford a
run-and-gun battle with traders for more than a few weeks. And
experts are now focusing on how Hong Kong officials plan to
extricate themselves from this standoff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, much of the speculation has centered on new regulations
that Hong Kong's financial secretary, Donald Tsang, would like to
place on the market. He proposes to tighten restrictions on the
short-selling of stocks, and to increase disclosure requirements on
investors who purchase index futures contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's Futures Exchange took a half-step in that direction
by tightening its own rules. Starting Tuesday, investors who buy
more than 10,000 futures contracts will have to pay 50 percent more
for margin coverage. More investors who buy contracts will also be
required to disclose their identities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure some will believe that we have tarred our reputation
as the freest market in the world,'' Tsang said in an interview
this weekend on a Hong Kong radio station. ``But they must remember
that there are some points when there are improper, abrupt market
movements.''
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said that efforts to cut back on short-selling of
stocks would be easy to get around. For example, investors may be
prohibited from short-selling a blue-chip stock like Hong Kong
Telecom. But they could simply sell short shares of that company in
London or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all the criticism of the intervention, Hong Kong has
struck a chord among people in Asia who fear that the brute force
of the global capital markets is not allowing the region's fragile
economies to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, has drawn wide attention here for advocating
foreign-exchange controls as a way of giving Asian leaders the
breathing space to pursue reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The globalization of the capital markets has gone ahead of
international monitoring, let alone regulation,'' said Ronnie Chan,
a Hong Kong developer who supports intervention. ``In the absence
of international regulations, I understand the motives of a local
government imposing restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Hong Kong's activist approach may be its
timing. Experts say capital controls would have been much more
effective when Asia was riding high _ and billions of dollars of
foreign investment was flooding in _ rather than during a recession
when Asia desperately needs capital.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of more pressing concern to people here is how Hong Kong plans
to get out of this campaign without huge losses. In a new report,
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. lays out three possibilities, none of them
particularly palatable.
</P>
<P>
   First, the government could stop buying shares and put its faith
in its monetary system. Under that system, which is called a
currency board, the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar
at a fixed exchange rate. When the currency comes under attack from
traders, the government raises interest rates, which encourages
investors to hold Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that a spike in rates would further weaken Hong
Kong's economy and could send the stock market into a renewed
tail-spin.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the government could dissolve the peg and allow the Hong
Kong dollar to float freely, like most other Asian currencies. That
would remove much of the motivation of traders to speculate against
the dollar. But it could also result in a wholesale flight of
capital from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Last, and most radical, the government could scrap the Hong Kong
dollar altogether and replace it with the U.S. dollar. Such a plan
has received attention here recently because, even more than a
floating exchange rate, it would eliminate opportunities for
speculation. But the report is skeptical of so-called dollarization
on both financial and political grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Hong Kong wins this cat-and-mouse game, some experts
worry that the price will be high. ``All of us have a lot of
sympathy with the government's desire to reduce the pain,'' said
Richard Margolis, a strategist with Merrill Lynch. ``But what
they've chosen to do is demonstrably not going to do that.''

ECHOES OF '29 _ BUT U.S. EXPECTED TO RIDE OUT SLUMP  
 

</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
   
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stock markets crash around the world, banking
systems teeter, currencies collapse, a major economic power makes
policy blunders that deepen its recession, and the economic
collapse of a major world power threatens the rise of an aggressive
military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Is it 1929 or 1998?
</P>
<P>
   It's still 1998, economists say _ but the outlook is precarious.
Despite the economic problems rippling across the globe and
Monday's crushing 513-point drop in the Dow Jones stock index,
forecasters remain sanguine about the prospects for U.S. growth,
predicting a slowdown but no recession.
</P>
<P>
   But few are dismissing the dangers _ many of which draw eerie
parallels with the Great Depression _ that now threaten the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does look ugly out there, for those of us looking back at
the 1930s,'' said Barry Eichengreen, an economic historian at the
University of California at Berkeley. ``The decline in commodity
prices looks a lot like the decline in the 1920s, the problems with
the banking system look a lot like the problems in the 1920s, the
disarray in the foreign exchange system looks a lot like the
problems that started in 1929.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Eichengreen added, ``I don't think the parallels go beyond
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sinai, chief economist for Primark Decision Economics,
echoed the views of many analysts: ``There are an incredible number
of global minefields, and there are a significant number of
countries in recession or depression or headed for one. But
overall, a world recession would require a North American recession
and a European recession, and that cannot be seen at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite swooning investor psychology, the U.S. and European
economies remain sound: Consumer confidence is high, inflation all
but dead, interest rates are low, productivity is up and employment
robust.
</P>
<P>
   Economists expect that global turbulence will slow U.S. growth
to around 2 percent this year, half last year's pace. Although that
remains a healthy rate, they are more worried than when the
economic crisis first hit Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
   The keys to watch are consumer and business confidence, said
Michael Boskin, chairman of President George Bush's Council of
Economic Advisers now at Stanford University. If the stock market
plunge dampens consumer and business spending, it could trigger a
recession.
</P>
<P>
   If the giant U.S. economy follows Asia and the developing world
into recession, a serious worldwide slump is all but certain. But
that scenario is regarded as a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``While perhaps a quarter of the world economy is in recession,
and that is going to put pressure on other economies including the
United States, the probability of a global disaster like the Great
Depression is remote,'' Boskin said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since the economic crisis struck Asia last year, weakness
has spread and accelerated with Russia's collapse.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, political vacuums have opened in the major
powers, reducing the ability of world leaders to respond. President
Clinton is weakened by scandal, Japan is gripped by political
paralysis, and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl may be toppled in next
month's elections. Russia's economic crash is fomenting dangerous
political instability in a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you consider that Germany went into hyperinflation,
followed by a depression in the 1930s, it's easy to understand why
dictators making nationalist appeals rise to power,'' said Gordon
Richards, an economist with the National Association of
Manufacturers. ``Russia has no long history of democracy, and there
is a serious threat of a breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And like the United States in the 1930s, where policymakers
reacted to an economic downturn with a disastrous monetary and
fiscal tightening that reverberated around the world, Japanese
policymakers have bungled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan made the same mistake in the 1990s as the U.S. made in
the early 1930s,'' Richards said. ``Faced with a collapse in stock
values, instead of providing stimulus, they applied restraint, just
as (President Herbert) Hoover did.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1930s, currencies linked to the gold standard came under
attack. Much like today, countries were forced to defend their
currencies with monetary policies that hurt growth, or to devalue,
triggering a panicked flight to gold, much like the rush to trade
rubles, baht or won for dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation, a Depression hallmark, is evident in many parts of
the globe, particularly Japan. Commodity prices are plunging, and
inflation is approaching zero in the United States and Europe. Many
believe that central bankers, riveted for decades on inflation
dangers, are ill-equipped to recognize and react to deflations.
</P>
<P>
   Deflation hammers asset values _ including stocks. It also
depresses corporate profits because businesses see prices for their
products fall.
</P>
<P>
   One remedy is to pump money into the economy, but until now, the
U.S. Federal Reserve has not done this because it is more concerned
with inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Another solution is to cut interest rates; but in Japan, rates
are already near zero, posing the classic ``liquidity trap'' that
plagued economies in the 1930s; cutting interest rates has no
effect when rates are near zero and investor confidence is
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   Another remedy is fiscal stimulus _ but again, the United States
is running a budget surplus, and having achieved that long-sought
goal, politicians are loath to return to big deficits. Moreover,
big long-term deficits in the social security systems of the United
States, Japan and Europe further constrain policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   In July, when the U.S. stock market was peaking, economists at
HSBC Investment Bank in London issued a prescient warning of
deflation's dangers: ``The world economy is in an intensely
dangerous phase,'' analysts wrote. ``Equities would face a blast
... the consequences for financial markets would be momentous.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts warn against equating the stock market with the
economy. ``The stock market has called nine of the last three
recessions,'' said Irwin Kellner, chief economist for CBS
Marketwatch and a professor at Hofstra University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recessions develop when the economy is overheating,'' Kellner
said; the stock plunge actually helps remedy that. Falling import
and commodity prices benefit consumers and businesses. And while a
Latin American recession would hurt exports, trade accounts for
just 15 percent of U.S. gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Eichengreen, the historian, notes that financial and economic
institutions are more sophisticated and better supervised than 60
years ago, and trade agreements could prevent the disastrous tariff
wars of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. banking system is in good shape,'' Eichengreen said.
``What made the 1929 recession into the Great Depression was first
and foremost that a deflation and recession were allowed to
destabilize banking systems in the core countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Tyson, former top economic adviser to President Clinton
and now dean of the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley, agreed.
The world has entered a period of increased uncertainty and risk,
Tyson said, ``but to go from there to a global recession is, I
think, to make a very big leap.''

 &HT;    Bengals mystery position close to being solved
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio _ Head coach Bruce Coslet is on the verge of
selecting youth over experience, meaning rookie second-round draft
pick Artrell Hawkins will probably win the starting job over
fifth-year veteran Corey Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as who takes the very first snap, we're leaning toward
Artrell,'' Coslet said. ``But they're both going to play because
they've both warranted playing time.''
</P>
<P>
   Once that is settled, the defensive lineup for Sunday's opener
against the Tennessee Oilers will be set.
</P>
<P>
   Nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen will be flanked by Michael
Bankston and Clyde Simmons at left and right end. James Francis,
Tom Tumulty, Takeo Spikes and Reinard Wilson are the linebackers.
Ashley Ambrose and Hawkins are the cornerbacks with Sam Shade and
Greg Myers at strong safety and free safety.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the scrimmage line, the Bengals are high on
offensive guard Scott Shaw, their newest acquisition. He was
overshadowed at Michigan State by tackle Flozell Adams, who was
drafted in the second round by the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5, 313-pound Shaw went in the fifth round to the
Miami Dolphins, who waived him on Aug. 25. The Bengals signed him
as a free agent Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's big, strong and smart,'' said Jim Lippincott, the
Bengals' director of pro/college personnel. ``I had a
top-of-the-fourth-round grade on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of guy where you went in looking at Flozell
Adams and you left talking about Scott Shaw. He can play center or
guard and be a long snapper. He'll contribute as soon as he learns
what's going on. It takes offensive linemen a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy McCullough, a seventh-round draft pick of the New Orleans
Saints, waived Sunday, is expected to sign with the Miami Dolphins
practice squad today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Central State wide receiver Alonzo Johnson was
signed to the Saints practice squad Monday after spending 1997 on
the New York Jets practice squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my roommate and teammate all in one day,'' Johnson said
about McCullough. ``Andy's getting an opportunity to showcase his
talent for (head coach) Jimmy Johnson, so he'll be OK. Coach Mike
Ditka told me I'll have a better chance playing here than with the
Jets. That really boosted me up.''
</P>
<P>
   Five players who were cut Sunday _ quarterback Eric Kresser,
tight end Damian Vaughn, linebacker Canute Curtis, offensive tackle
Mike Doughty and defensive end Harry Deligianis _ cleared waivers
and were signed to the Bengals practice squad Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bengals rookie offensive guard Mike Goff misses his lightning
fast University of Iowa teammate Tim Dwight.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight, a wide receiver and kick-return specialist for the
Atlanta Falcons, had three punt returns for 28 yards in Friday's
17-0 victory over the Bengals. Dwight's 68-yard punt return for a
TD was nullified by a holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like, `Darn, but good for you,' '' Goff said about
Dwight. ``It was weird seeing him making plays, but not for the
team I was on. He hasn't changed. He's still the quickest little
guy I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet credited Damon Gibson's versatility with landing on the
Bengals roster. ``The thing about Gibson is: He's made plays,''
Coslet said. ``I think he can help us on punt returns.'' . . .
Lippincott is heading out on the road, getting ready for the 1999
NFL Draft. His first wave of stops will be at Illinois, Purdue and
Indiana State. . . . If the Bengals-Oilers game isn't sold out by
Thursday at 1:01 p.m., it won't be televised locally on Channel 7.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Baseball history even makes up for the drizzle
 &HT;    By Frank Cerabino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We should be miserable.
</P>
<P>
   It's drizzling again. Our seats our wet. Even if they were dry,
we'd still have the worst seats in the house, seats in the
left-field upper deck that seem to require a telescope rather than
binoculars.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, we're in the middle of everything _ this game, baseball
history, and all that is repulsive, foolish, yet thrilling about
the quest for a piece of memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire, the man who is our ticket to fame and fortune _ or
at least a 20-second interview on the evening news _ is swinging
the bat, way down there on the field, and we can visualize it all.
We can imagine the ball springing off his bat and landing here
among us, the antlike minions who will undoubtedly tear each other
limb from limb to get a McGwire home run ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ground zero,'' Mark Drew, of Palm Beach Gardens, says.
</P>
<P>
   Drew is in the row in front of me, pounding his mitt. So is his
son, and his neighbor. All around us, people are standing,
chanting, begging for McGwire to deposit a little round souvenir.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour ago, I would have said we were sitting way out of
range. Certainly, no ball would come up here. Home runs to left
field would go to the club level, the level below us.
</P>
<P>
   This is so far away, that it's the first time this season the
Marlins have opened this part of the upper deck for seating.
</P>
<P>
   So, during batting practice I stood with hundreds of others in
the lower club level, expecting to catch McGwire batting practice
homers. All the other batting practice homers were in the club
level seats.
</P>
<P>
   But we had underestimated Big Mac. He launched four balls into
the upper deck. Estimates of his power had to be reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   And so, during the game, I sat up in the upper deck, surrounded
by people who got their seats by spending $100 at Old Navy clothing
stores in exchange for two tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kid's school clothes,'' Don Branch, of Royal Palm Beach,
explained. Don was in the row in front of me sitting behind his
son, Rosco, and two of his friends, Andrew Lovitt, and Brandon
Green, from the Crestwood Middle School baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   The three boys had skipped practice today for a chance at
getting a McGwire home run ball. Naturally, those boys were
pounding their mitts too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, remember to drop down low and go for it,'' Branch was
telling his son and his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Number 56,'' Mark Drew shouts. ``Right here!''
</P>
<P>
   Cameras flash with every pitch, and every time Marlins pitcher
Kirt Ojala throws McGwire a pitch he can't hit, we boo. As if
McGwire was on the home team, and the Marlins were the impertinent
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stink!'' Roscoe Branch shouts at the Marlins pitcher, as
he tries not to give McGwire something to hit.
</P>
<P>
   Little Roscoe's got a plan for any valuable McGwire souvenir
that finds its way into Roscoe's mitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to buy a WaveRunner,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But McGwire pops out to the catcher his first at bat, not even
putting the ball in play. Electricity unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   Until the third inning. That's when McGwire comes to bat again.
Once again, we're all standing, whistling, shouting, hopping around
as if we're

 &HT;    Time is the greatest need for working parents
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ May the Lord _ and employers _ have mercy on working
parents. When school starts, all who have ever been part of that
most difficult of all juggling acts know the pressures: Who will
drive the car pool to soccer? Which child has an orthodontist
appointment and who will pick up the birthday present for a little
friend's party? And what about the school bus? Pray it comes before
both Mom and Dad have to leave for work.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a preschooler, too _ well, it's exhausting and there
aren't enough hours in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A new study commissioned by Catalyst, a national research
organization that monitors women and work, finds no gender gap in
the major challenge for working men and women: lack of time. In
fact, 85 percent of the respondents (men and women) name flexible
hours as the program they'd most like their companies to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Our three children are grown, and I am watching the next
generation begin the juggling act. Some of the variables _ who
takes off work to care for a sick child, or which parent will stay
home , as I did, during infant and preschool years _ haven't
changed much. But the attitudes of men are far more similar to
women's on family issues than they were several decades ago when my
husband and I tried to combine careers with raising three children.
For example, two-thirds of men and a similar percentage of women
say having a working spouse gives them the freedom to take career
risks _ change jobs or careers, start a business. And men as well
as women say they'd like customized career paths, and more choice
in pace of advancement when children are young.
</P>
<P>
   There are still telling differences between men and women in
terms of whose career takes priority, and who will shoulder the
primary child-care responsibilities. Only 6 percent of women say
their careers are primary, compared with 33 percent of men. The
not-so-surprising response is surely related to the gap in
satisfaction with ability to balance work and home
responsibilities. Seventy-three percent of men say they're happy
with the balance, while only 58 percent of women are.
</P>
<P>
   The added pressure women feel goes to the traditional role
mothers have always played in planning children's activities. I
remember feeling grateful for a husband who would drive car pools
and take kids for hamburgers when needed. But I also remember
feeling that if I suddenly dropped dead, nobody would know when to
schedule the next dentist appointment or what day the piano lessons
were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have responded to needs of working parents _ with
cafeteria benefits and child care assistance. Some have pioneered
innovative family-friendly programs. Xerox offers a Life Cycle
Program that provides a $10,000 account to all employees, $2,000 of
which can be withdrawn annually, to help with first-home down
payment, child care needs or extended health care. It's likely that
in the future, more employers will offer options aimed at holding
onto the dual-career families who comprise 45 percent of the work
force.
</P>
<P>
   As the study indicates, that percentage is likely to go up, not
down. Two-thirds of working couples say even if they didn't need
both incomes, they would continue to work for the intellectual and
personal fulfillment.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Sosa, McGwire's race to Maris is a mind game
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Sammy Sosa is playing this little mind game with
himself, with the media . . . and maybe with Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   He says he knows that every time he draws even with McGwire in
The Race to Roger Maris , McGwire will answer longer and louder.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he says. Maybe he believes it, but it smacks of con
artistry. If he says it enough, maybe McGwire will believe it and
Sosa can come storming down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, August 30, in the rarefied air of Denver's Coors
Field, Sosa crushed home run No. 54, a ball estimated at 482 feet,
longest home run in CLF this year and the fifth-longest ever. That
tied McGwire, who was playing a night game in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Said Sosa after his game and before McGwire's game, ``I know he
is going to come back and take the lead. That's that I want him to
do. As I say, Mark is The Man. I'm pulling for Mark. He is my
idol.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was right on . . . again. Not only did McGwire recapture
the lead with his 55th homer Sunday night, he hit it farther in the
heavy, muggy St. Louis night than Sosa did in Denver . . . an
estimated 501 feet.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it keeps happening.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa hit two home runs on August 10 in San Francisco to tie
McGwire at 46, but McGwire launched No. 47 the next day in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa pulled up next to McGwire on August 16 in Houston with No.
47 and stuck his nose in front with his 48th against St. Louis at
Wrigley field on August 19. McGwire tied Sosa in his next at-bat
three innings later at 48, then recaptured the lead with his 49th
in the 10th inning in a head-to-head battle.
</P>
<P>
   From there, McGwire spurted to a 53-49 lead until Sosa drew even
at 54-54 with his 482-foot explosion Sunday afternoon, only to have
McGwire splat No. 55 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best-hit ball I've ever seen,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman
said of Sosa's crusher.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is like a racehorse who comes off the pace, and it won't be
shocking if it is he who passes Maris and the 61 home run marker
first. And if he doesn't, even if McGwire gets there first, it
wouldn't be surprising if Sosa hits more before the season is over
_ like 66 to 65.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa is the one relaxed and running just off McGwire's shoulder,
a half-length behind, letting Big Mac feel the pressure and pave
the way.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, McGwire led Sosa, 27-13, but Sosa closed ground
fast and shows no sign of fatigue. He has 45 home runs and 103 runs
batted in his last 85 games (since May 25), and needs only eight
homers in his last 25 games _ about 100 at-bats _ to pass Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa's constant worship of McGwire is an attempt to keep the
attention focused on his opponent. He as much as admits it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep it the way it is for me now, low profile.
Whoever it is, me or Mark, doesn't make any difference to me. If I
get it first, God bless America,'' Sosa says. ``It's a beautiful
country. And if he gets there first, I still love America.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, though, says he is now witnessing the same approach from
pitchers that McGwire sees.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting two home runs over the weekend in Coors Light,
Sosa said, ``Buddy, I'm lucky I hit two. The way I've been going
lately, it's not like it used to be. Pitchers are not going to give
me something to hit. It's not like the guys who have 22 or 25 home
runs. We're talking about a lot of home runs. The whole series they
were pitching me a little bit perfectly. I tip my hat because at
least I hit two. I'm very pleased with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Going into the first game of a three-game series against
Cincinnati's pitching staff at Wrigley Field on Monday night, Sosa
had hit 11 home runs in his last 21 games. He hit 20 in June and
had 12 in August, with all of September remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Sosa doesn't hit more homers than McGwire, and the
feeling here is that he will, Sosa should be the National League's
Most Valuable Player if the Cubs win the wild card and make it to
the playoffs. He leads McGwire in RBIs, 134-119, and McGwire's
Cardinals are skidding toward the bottom of the National League
Central.
</P>
<P>
   Even McGwire acknowledges that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sosa is having a magical year, a way better year than I'm
having. His team is right there in the wild-card race, he's driven
in quite a few more runs and hit for a higher average,'' McGwire
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sosa says McGwire is The Man. Maybe so. But Sosa is The
Superman.

 &HT;    Autobiography of Grosz fleshes out the artist
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of California Press has published the
autobiography of George Grosz ($17.95), the savage satirist of
Weimar Germany, whose work is as indispensable for an understanding
of the period as Christopher Isherwood's Berlin Stories.
</P>
<P>
   Grosz died in 1959, and his book has long been out of print. As
a writer, he was kinder than he was as an artist, although there
are fascinating glimpses of the German colony adrift in California
in the '30s and '40s. The book is full of full-page drawings and
sketches in the margins that remind you why, once glimpsed, his
savage caricatures of Germans of all classes can't be ignored or
forgotten. Grosz was clearly a primary inspiration for Ronald
Searle.
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTOR'S CUT? NO, CUTTING CORNERS ... On another level
entirely, there were worse directors than Al Adamson - the immortal
Ed Wood, for one - but Adamson had his moments. The son of an
exploitation filmmaker named Denver Dixon, who went all the way
back to the silent days, Adamson specialized in biker and horror
movies for drive-ins, with such stars as Russ Tamblyn - many, many
years after West Side Story - and Lon Chaney, Jr., in his last
bloated, alcoholic days.
</P>
<P>
   Titles? Satan's Sadists, Five Bloody Graves, The Female Bunch,
Blood of Ghastly Horror and Dracula vs. Frankenstein. If these
titles ring a bell, you should be ashamed of yourself - you've
spent far too much time in dark rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dracula vs. Frankenstein starred one Zander Vorkov as Dracula,
whose real name was Roger Engel - a stockbroker. ``I didn't
consider him an actor,'' remembered the movie's producer, ``but Al
thought he looked like Dracula so we used him. I thought he was
pretty good, but I thought he was better as Mohammed in Brain of
Blood.''
</P>
<P>
   David Konow's very amusing Schlock-O-Rama: The Films of Al
Adamson (Lone Eagle, $19.95) tells you all you could ever want to
know about Adamson and his ouevre. AFTER D-DAY ... The movies
Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line have reawakened interest
in World War II. Among upcoming nonfiction books on the subject are
The Nazi Officer's Wife, about Edith Hahn, a Jewish woman who now
lives in Israel. Other projects are We Band of Angels (Random
House), about a nursing unit in the Pacific, and The Nightingale's
Song (Bantam), the story of the men who raised the flag at Iwo
Jima, told by James Bradley, the son of one of them.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE ... ``Marriage is ultimately an agreement - or
conspiracy - between two people to treat each other as having each
the right to be loved absolutely. If there is not this
understanding, there is no marriage. If there is this understanding
all the things that are supposed to go with marriage - children,
sex, etc. - are secondary.''

 &HT;    Dead politicians, brain dead voters
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An interesting dilemma in Oklahoma: On Tuesday, August 25th, a
dead woman received enough votes to be in the runoff for the
Democratic nomination for a U.S. Senate seat. Now, by law, her name
must be placed on the Sept. 15 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Morrow Lewis Ledgerwood, 69, died of a heart attack
July 15, too late for her name to be removed from the primary
ballot. In a field of four Democratic candidates, she came in
second with 21 percent of the votes. (An air-conditioning
contractor finished first with 46 percent.) If the late Ms.
Ledgerwood wins the runoff, the Democrats will have to appoint a
nominee (not necessarily her runoff opponent) to face Republican
Sen. Don Nickles in November.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whom the Democrats nominate, the chance of any
Democrat in Oklahoma upsetting Republican Gov. Frank Keating, Sen.
Nickles and all six members of the U.S. House (none opposed in the
primary) is minuscule. Still, in the interest of a sane democracy,
we should want to know how a dead person achieved such success in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Wilcox, a political director at the state Democratic Party
headquarters, confided to reporters he was baffled. ``I had a
couple of people tell me they voted for her because she had the
longest name,'' he said. Other explanations for the strong support
given a deceased candidate included not knowing she was dead,
voting based on gender, and the predictable joke: It was a
Republican conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, while we laugh at those clueless Okies, let's pause to
think about how Floridians will vote Tuesday, not only for
candidates but also on issues. Will we base votes on the length of
a name? Gender? Race? Will we enter the voting booth ignorant of
the issues and mark our ballots more capriciously than we would
select entrees from a menu? Or will we sit out the primary and
local elections and just wait until the big election in November?
Better still, perhaps we should wait for the next presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Sept. 1 election comes less than a week after the 35th
anniversary of the historic March on Washington. On Aug. 28, 1963,
about 250,000 people of all races gathered at the Lincoln Memorial,
where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King delivered the most widely
acclaimed civil rights address of the last half of the 20th
century. People of goodwill (and even others not so well
intentioned) could not deny the moral urgency of his message: Our
dream of a true American democracy can become reality only if all
citizens exercise their civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   Today we revel in the eloquent phrases of that speech, memorized
by school kids and recited in bits and pieces like a feel-good
mantra by all of us on occasion. In practice, however, we have
disregarded Dr. King's plea to all Americans that we value our
precious ballots as instruments for positive change. Such apathy,
considering the price paid for us to be able to go unhindered to
the polls without fear of violence, is an insult to all who fought
for this freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Those too young or too ignorant of the struggle that brought us
to this pass should read (ITALS) Walking With the Wind, (UNITALS)
the autobiography of Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. As young man, Mr. Lewis
marched beside Dr. King in many of the mass demonstrations and also
recruited black citizens to register. Often, law-enforcement
officers blocked his path to the registration books. The courage of
those who risked their jobs, their property and even their lives to
vote provides an awesome example that should inspire people of all
races. But our voting record suggest we are not sufficiently
inspired. Too many of us refuse to become informed and turn out to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, all that is required is the will to accept the
mandate that our democracy will be of the people. If we sit this
election out or vote capriciously on whim, on Wednesday, we will
probably complain that the special interests control our state.
</P>
<P>
   If so, they do so with our freely given permission because we
don't care enough to make democracy work.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Things to do next summer
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Summer vacation is all gone, and as usual the
list of ``things to do this summer,'' which I made in a fit of
spring optimism, has not been addressed. I'm thinking it can't hurt
to look it over now since it's too late to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Item 1: Balance checkbook. I understand why this one ranks tops
on the priority list, but I'm not sure what made me think I'd have
any better luck this summer than I did last winter. It didn't add
up then, and it's a heckuva lot worse now.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the formula on the back of the statement, I've been
advised. Just fill in the blanks, they tell me. OK, I did that; the
bank's balance here, my balance there. Then be sure they match.
Match what? The wallpaper?
</P>
<P>
   And now we're being encouraged to do all of our banking and
bill-paying by computer. I don't think so. It could only get worse.
And then what if I fall victim to the Y2K (year 2000) bug? That's
the glitch that's going to cause computers around the world to rise
up on their hind legs in total abandon at the stroke of midnight,
2000, and recklessly gorge themselves on everything from Social
Security accounts to Frederick's of Hollywood's preferred customer
list without so much as a ``by your leave'' or a thank-you belch.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what all of this means to me, but just in case I've
decided to take my $419.27 out of the bank and stuff it under the
mattress. If things get as bad as some of the financial types are
predicting, who knows? Maybe I'll have enough to buy Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Status: Hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   Item 2: Practice the piano until I can play Rachmaninoff's
``Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini'' without swearing and skipping
the hard parts.
</P>
<P>
   Status: Working on a simplified version of ``Winter
Wonderland.''
</P>
<P>
   Item 3: Learn to cook neat stuff so I can have impressive
leftovers to take to school for lunch. I hate watching other
teachers pull stuff out of the microwave that looks like they just
hired Oprah's cook.
</P>
<P>
   Status: Perfecting a recipe for Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle's Tomatoes
Stuffed With Cottage Cheese from ``Peter Rabbit's Natural Foods
Cookbook.'' Winter's looking pretty bleak.
</P>
<P>
   Item 4: Buy some clothes that match _ each other _ and stop
showing up for school in my son's hand-me-downs. The kids are
beginning to point me out to lowerclassmen in the halls and the
administration is looking pained.
</P>
<P>
   Status: Call in to my son to see what he's outgrown.
</P>
<P>
   Item 5: Watch C-Span and CNN and try to figure out what's going
on in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Status: My timing seems to be off. Whenever I tune in to C-Span
there's some guy in a suit making a speech to nobody. Everybody
else has gone home. I listen to a couple of them and I can
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   Switch to the talking newsheads. Know what I've learned for
sure? In spite of all of the babble and bleat, nobody knows any
more than I do.
</P>
<P>
   And then, while I'm still figuring, our fearless leader
addresses the nation and confesses to lusting in the Oval Office.
Bummer. Why couldn't he have done it in his heart like Jimmy
Carter?
</P>
<P>
   Hillary's ticked and I don't blame her. But I'm tired of
listening to folks trying to second-guess her motives. Rat that
Bill's been, he's still her husband _ even though he behaves more
like a prodigal son. She probably knew when she married him she was
taking him to raise. She ain't stupid, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chelsea keeps smiling. Seems like a good kid.
</P>
<P>
   I'd like to believe that everybody loves everybody in this
family, but Pop just got a little carried away.
</P>
<P>
   And though the list goes on, I'm quitting before I get more
confused and further behind. School starts in a couple of days and
in a way, I'm glad to be going back to work where all I have to
worry about are mismatched pronouns and an occasional dangling
participle.

 &HT;    TV Station born at noon
 &HT;    By Marguerite M. Plunkett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Following a champagne toast by Lowell
``Bud'' Paxson, PAX TV, the nation's seventh commercial network,
was born at noon Monday, August 31.
</P>
<P>
   The launch was without glitches or surprises, according to
Paxson Communications Chief Executive Jeff Sagansky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I don't have a better story,'' Sagansky said.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson, chairman of West Palm Beach-based Paxson Communications,
PAX TV's parent, toasted the hard work of his employees and said he
is confident the family-friendly network will succeed, Sagansky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reruns of Touched by an Angel and others, including Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman and Diagnosis Murder, are the foundation of the new
network, announced in November. The programming is broadcast by 95
stations owned, operated, or affiliated with Paxson, reaching 76
million households with television sets. Paxson also has cut deals
with cable TV companies to air PAX TV where the company doesn't
have stations.
</P>
<P>
   PAX TV's local station is Paxson-owned WPXP-Channel 67.
</P>
<P>
   The first advertisement to run on the network's first show _ the
Paxson-produced Great Day America _ was for AvMed health plan,
followed by Isis Prepaid Cellular. The second commercial break
included a promotion for PAX TV shows and and an ad for a Time-Life
classic music collection. Other ads in the first hour were for
South Florida Ford dealers, The Complete Runners Guide and Palm
Beach Atlantic College in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schulman, a Boca Raton media buyer, said it's too early to
size up the network's advertising without knowing the rates that
are being paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very early,'' Schulman said.
</P>
<P>
   Paxson's stock (AMEX: PAX) was off $1.06 a share Monday to close
at $9.13 _ on a day when the Dow Jones average closed down more
than 500 points.
</P>
<P>
   Sagansky suggested PAX TV could provide some comfort to market
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a day like today,'' he said, ``they're going to need
Touched by an Angel.''
</P>
<P>
   Headquarters: West Palm Beach
</P>
<P>
   Network: 95 stations owned, operated or affiliated with Paxson
</P>
<P>
   Reach: 76 million households
</P>
<P>
   First commercial: AvMed

 &HT;    Dell prices PCs for performance, profits
 &HT;    EDS: Photos available.
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Dell Computer Corp. says it doesn't sell
sub-$1,000 personal computers because its customers don't want
them.
</P>
<P>
   That's the company's public response to the cheap PC trend.
Privately, a high-level Dell executive says the company doesn't
want to be in the low-end PC market. The company sees little profit
in bargain-priced computers, and it intends to avoid the segment as
long as it can.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dell has targeted knowledgeable buyers who want
high-performance computers for high-end computer games, image
processing, desktop video conferencing and processing computer
video clips.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it can avoid the consumer price wars, analysts say, but
sooner or later the battlefield will shift to Dell's
bread-and-butter _ computer sales to big businesses and government
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell is extremely vulnerable in this space,'' said analyst Tom
Rhinelander of Forrester Research. ``They are going to have to
fight it out in the corporate space the same way the industry has
been fighting it out in the consumer space.''
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the Round Rock company will continue to try to hone
its direct sales method to squeeze out as much overhead as
possible. That allows the company to turn its inventory quickly and
to offer the latest technology, often before its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   That also means that Dell moves to higher-performance computers
faster than its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials acknowledge that the sub-$1,000 market is
sizable, but they hope that today's customers for low-end computers
graduate to higher-priced systems when they buy their second
computers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dell has prospered as other PC makers have been buffeted
by the switch to sub-$1,000 computers. Compaq, IBM and
Hewlett-Packard have blamed lower PC revenues in recent quarters on
the cheap computers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell tested the market for low-cost computers in the early 1990s
when it tried to sell them through the king of discount, Wal-Mart,
and four other chains. After four years of disappointing profits,
Dell retreated.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dell sells higher-cost server computers to Wal-Mart. The
nation's biggest retailer uses the servers to let customers see and
hear samples of videos and compact discs.
</P>
<P>
   Dell has not totally ignored the trend toward lower-cost
machines. Last Monday, the company said it was making computers
using a version of Intel Corp.'s Celeron chip. That PC, a Dell
Dimension model, would sell for about $1,399, including a monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The lower price means the average price of a Dell computer will
continue to drop. The average cost of a Dell PC has fallen from
$2,700 a year ago to $2,400 now. In the same time, the average cost
of a PC sold in a store dropped from $1,424 to $1,141.
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials say the company is more competitive on the
low-cost end than it may appear.
</P>
<P>
   They note that most Dell home systems include a 17-inch color
monitor. Most low-cost system prices don't include the monitor,
which retails for $300 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also ships its base-model desktop units with 64 megabytes
of dynamic random access memory, compared with 32 megabytes for
many competitors. More memory can speed computer performance for
handling some information-intensive software programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news,'' says David Hood, Dell's vice president and
general manager for the home systems business, ``is that PCs at
every price deliver more performance for the dollar than ever
before. The challenge for consumers is to look behind the pricetag
and understand if the PC's technology will keep up with their
current and future needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that Dell is far more insulated than nearly any
other computer maker from the low-cost computer trend, because of
its large base of business customers and performance-hungry
consumers who are willing to pay more for high-performance
machines.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate customers tend to prefer name brands and
well-established service relationships when they buy computers.
</P>
<P>
   Dell also is increasingly relying on sales of server and
high-end workstations to bolster its profit margins. In its fiscal
year that ended in January, enterprise systems, as the company
calls them, accounted for 11 percent of the company's $12 billion
in sales. So far this year, server computers account for 12 percent
of Dell's sales.
</P>
<P>
   But if the low-end price segment continues to grow, analysts
say, Dell eventually will have to join the fray as business
customers start becoming more interested in low-cost machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dell is enjoying higher profit margins because they are
playing on the high-end of the market,'' said analyst Cody Acree
with Southwest Securities. ``You are not going to be able to sell a
corporate PC for $2,500 and a consumer PC for $1,000, and they both
do essentially the same thing. Eventually, the corporations balk at
that price difference, or your competitors go to your corporate
customers.''

 &HT;    Lower-price PCs put pressure on industry
 &HT;    Eds: Photos and graphic available.
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mark Martich set out to replace his 6-year-old
home computer this spring and wound up in the middle of the biggest
trend to hit the personal computer industry in years.
</P>
<P>
   He bought a PC for $499.
</P>
<P>
   While it wouldn't meet the demands of gamers or graphics
designers, the machine does what Martich wants: word processing,
Internet browsing and handling a small database of business
contacts. He may also use the computer in a sideline business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a box that was pretty much all I needed,'' said Martich,
a sales manager for a truck dealership. ``I'm not a computer geek,
but when I priced it out, I couldn't find any holes.''
</P>
<P>
   His new PC _ purchased from N.C.S. (formerly The Neighborhood
Computer Store), a small store in Austin _ didn't include a monitor
(he already had one) or a separate video accelerator card, which
can speed graphics software performance.
</P>
<P>
   PC buyers like Martich, motivated more by price than by the
flashiest technology, represent an industry turning point,
observers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sub-$1,000 PC is as important to the computer industry as
the invention of the Model-T Ford,'' which brought the automobile
into the mass market, said analyst Michael Gale, director of brand
management for the IntelliQuest market research firm in Austin.
``It becomes a non-geek buy. Any human being can buy a computer
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is reshaping the whole industry,'' said Tom Rhinelander,
an analyst with the Forrester Group of Cambridge, Mass. ``We are
going to look back to the Windows 95 launch (in 1995) as the height
of the PC world, because people cared about something as stupid as
an operating system and were willing to pay high prices for
computers. That hobbyist mentality is no longer what drives the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gale and other analysts say this shift may be permanent. Once
buyers have experienced low prices, they are unlikely to pay more.
</P>
<P>
   The change is already causing problems in the PC industry, and
the problems could get worse.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers competing in the market of PCs that cost under
$1,000, such as Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston, have reported
weaker profits, as have chip makers such as Intel Corp. and
chip-equipment makers such as Applied Materials Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers have demanded lower prices from suppliers in
order to keep their sales prices down. The tough stance on prices
is affecting component suppliers throughout the industry, ranging
from chip makers to manufacturers of hard-disk drives and video
accelerator cards.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as Applied began laying off 2,000 workers around the
world, including 600 in Austin, Chief Executive James Morgan put
part of the blame on sub-$1,000 PCs. In fact, the healthiest
company in the personal computer industry, Austin-based Dell
Computer Corp., has avoided selling ultra-low-cost computers
because executives are skeptical that they can be profitable. But
Dell has adjusted to the trend, introducing a new Dimension model
last week with a base price of $1,399.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Dell's reluctance to get into the low-end market, some
analysts believe PCs are following the pricing pattern common in
consumer electronics such as televisions, CD players and VCRs.
While expensive, fancy-featured versions are still available,
prices fall for more basic models with fewer bells and whistles.
Forrester Research projects that low-cost computers will lure 21
million first-time buyers into the personal computer market in the
next five years and will boost computer use in the United States
from an estimated 43 percent of households today to about 60
percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Research from Forrester shows the relationship between the cost
of a PC and market penetration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, just 13.8 percent of PC sales were in the sub-$1,000
category, with the bulk of sales in the $1,000 to $2,500 range.
</P>
<P>
   By 2001, PCs costing less than $1,000 will account for 34.3
percent of the market and another 35 percent will be in the $1,000
to $1,500 range, according to Forrester's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The $499 that Martich paid is at the low end of the price
spectrum. But the average price of PCs sold to individual consumers
by retailers dropped by $501, to $1,141, between January 1997 and
June 1998, according to ZD Market Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The average price paid by business buyers, $1,396 in June, had
declined by 15 percent in a year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for the shift.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for chips and other components are lower because of a
production glut and softening of demand created by the Asian
economic crises.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important factor is what experts call the software
gap. Throughout the roughly 20-year history of the PC,
more-complicated software has always kept users hungry for more
power.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 95 operating system was
a prime example. Many users bought more powerful computers to
handle the demands of the new system.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the pace of improving performance in computer
hardware has far outstripped software advances. Experts say there
is little new software that would compel an average computer user
to buy a more powerful machine.
</P>
<P>
   Some users _ engineers, technical workers and those wanting to
play the most advanced games _ will continue to require the most
advanced computer available. But most users won't have to pay
premium prices for blistering performance.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Henry, a former top product development manager for IBM
and Dell Computer, now fervently supports the part of the industry
developing new low-end basic PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Henry's company, Centaur Technology of Austin, designs the
WinChip, an Intel-compatible processor chip that is made by
Integrated Device Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The chips sell for between $40 and $65, compared with processors
made by Intel Corp. that can cost hundreds of dollars each. Tens of
thousands have been shipped to computer makers in China and other
developing countries. Others are used by no-name clone makers in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Henry believes today's low-end machines are a precursor to even
cheaper computers in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am dealing with guys who are planning sub-$500 computers for
Christmas and sub-$300 computers by early next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Very low-cost machines like the one Martich bought have been
available mainly from small manufacturers, which typically have low
overhead, buy components as cheaply as possible and publicize their
wares only in small newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   N.C.S. is emblematic of some small clone makers in Austin and
around the country. The business, begun by John Hankins and his
father, Allen, moved from their homes to a small modular building
at 512 E. Oltorf St. a year ago as customer demand grew.
</P>
<P>
   But cheap PCs are becoming more available in mainstream stores.
</P>
<P>
   Micro Center, a chain of 13 computer stores based in Columbus,
Ohio, this month began selling a $399 computer under the Power Spec
label. On Thursday, PrecisionTec LLC, a maker based in Costa Mesa,
Calif., introduced its Gazelle machine for the same price, for sale
over the Internet through Egghead.com and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The low prices don't include monitors, which usually start at
about $150. But they expand a growing sub-$500 market. Millenium
Electronics Inc., for example, in March began selling a $499
machine under the Laguna label at Sun TV &AMP; Appliances Inc. and
Frye's Electronics stores, based in California.
</P>
<P>
   PC makers have shown that they can sell millions of low-cost
computers. What hasn't been shown is whether they or their
suppliers can make much money in that market.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp., an industry giant that helped popularize
the low-cost machines to gain market share, says it re-engineered
its design and assembly processes to make a profit on low-end
machines. But analysts doubt that Compaq is making much profit on
the boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales growth has slowed as lower-cost PCs have
become more popular. In the second quarter, Compaq's product sales
totaled $5.8 billion, only a subpar 6 percent more than it sold in
the same quarter the year before.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, computer executives put on a brave face about
potential profits from their low-end models. Privately, they
confess that the industry is under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of the sub-$1,000 space is creating a lot of
havoc in the industry,'' said one marketing executive, who asked
not to be identified because he did not have permission to speak
for his company, a sizable PC maker. ``It's a thorny issue that we
are dealing with every day. The PC market is ugly and a battle.
It's not a fun business.''
</P>
<P>
   If they can't make money on the sales side, PC companies are
trying to save money on the supply side.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are insisting that makers of chips, hard-disk drives
and video cards cut their prices to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Even Intel, the most powerful and profitable chip maker, has cut
jobs and costs this year to cope with slowing revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has led the industry in making faster, more
powerful chips, was late entering the sub-$1,000 market. Only last
week did Intel bring out a new version of its lower cost Celeron
chip that analysts say can compete with those offered by AMD and
National Semiconductor's Cyrix unit. The first Celeron, released in
April, had disappointing performance.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, Intel's largest rival in the low-end PC business, has found
good news and bad news in that segment.
</P>
<P>
   AMD, which employs more than 4,000 people in Austin, is selling
more of its Austin-made K6 microprocessors than ever, but at prices
well below its original asking prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of AMD's hottest chips, the K6-2 300-megahertz model,
dropped from $220 each to $120 between early June and early July,
according to the Piper Jaffray securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   AMD lost $64.6 million in the second quarter. Company officials
say they need to see higher processor prices in order to return to
profitability soon.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Mike Feibus with Mercury Research in Scottsdale, Ariz.,
says the industry will take time to sort out out the new rules of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next 18 months there will be a lot of flailing while
the industry figures out what to do and how to adjust,'' he said.

 &HT;    CHEAP PC'S: Winners and losers
 &HT;    By Kirk Ladendorf
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINNERS
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp.: The company that makes the operating system for
90 percent of the world's PCs sells more software as more computers
are sold. The price of the software does not vary with the cost of
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Online service providers: More new computer users means more
online connections to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers: They can buy more computer for less money than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   LOSERS
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp.: Still the biggest, strongest company in electronics
hardware, but its fat profit margins may be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Component makers: Makers of video cards, audio cards and
hard-disk drives already are moaning about having to live with
lower prices and skinnier profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Inefficient PC makers: Those companies that can't drive down
costs are going to get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers: With margins cut to the bone, big retailers like
CompUSA are going to have to make money on peripherals, service and
warranties.
</P>
<P>
   SURVIVORS
</P>
<P>
   Compaq Computer: It and a few other giants will cut costs to the
bone and sell more machines. They can still make money on high-end
server computers and services.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer: The company may have the lowest costs in the
industry, and it sells its machines for far more than the industry
average.
</P>
<P>
   Small clone makers: They will continue to sell lots of machines.
Many consumers and small businesses still like the close contact
and personal service that clone makers can provide.

 &HT;    Alligator season opens
 &HT;    By Joe Brogan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At a half-hour before sunset, some of
the 680 men and women with permits for this year's state alligator
hunt set out with harpoons and bang sticks to bag as many as five
gators apiece.
</P>
<P>
   It's illegal to use rifles or pistols to hunt the reptiles, so
many hunters use hooked baits, harpoons or arrows with lines
attached to bring the gators to the boat, said state biologist
Lindsey Hord.
</P>
<P>
   Once the animals are captured, hunters usually use a bang stick
to kill them, Hord said.
</P>
<P>
   Bang sticks, commonly used to kill aggressive sharks, contain a
bullet or shotgun shell that fires when the stick is pressed
against the back of a gator's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend time at seminars telling them how to humanely kill
(alligators),'' Hord said. ``The bang stick destroys the brain and
after that the spinal cord is severed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Animal Rights Foundation of Florida doesn't see it that
way. Members will demonstrate against the hunt at 6:30 p.m. at the
public boat ramp at the Belle Glade Marina and Campground on Torry
Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunters are killing these magnificent animals for no other
reason than pleasure from the kill, and shamefully, the state is an
accomplice in these despicable acts,'' said foundation spokesman
Nicolas Atwood.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt will be done in two, 15-day phases at 23 lakes and
rivers statewide until it ends Sept. 30, Hord said.
</P>
<P>
   After a 26-year ban, the state allowed the first open season on
gators in 1988 to help preserve Florida's population of American
alligators, which number about 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Florida residents paid $250 for a permit and non-residents
$1,000, if they were lucky enough to be picked at random from about
10,000 applications, he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the hunters is Daniel Fountain, a financial adviser from
West Palm Beach, who got six gators two years ago and is slated to
hunt Sept. 15 in Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   Fountain uses a boat and trolling motor to sneak up on gators,
which become very wary during the hunt, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a totally different hunt from being in a tree stand or
out in the woods,'' Fountain said. ``You're out there at night
hunting something most people are afraid of.''

 &HT;    Kids find city's money online
 &HT;    By Seth Mnookin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ When you're running a city, you can use all
the help you can get.
</P>
<P>
   So Mayor Carol Hanson was plenty pleased when she got a letter
from a constituent pointing out that the city was owed $700 in
unclaimed money. Even if the letter did begin, ``Dear Mr. Mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My name is Richie Behlog,'' the letter read. ``I am 12 years
old. I live in Boca Raton, Fla. I was on the Internet and found
this unclaimed money that belongs to you. My mom said I should send
it to you. So I am. I hope I am the first person to tell you about
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Richie was the first person to bring the money to the
mayor's attention, although the city had been investigating any
unclaimed cash it was owed, city revenue accountant Nicole Gasparri
said. Richie and his 11-year-old brother, Anthony, were the first
to notice money owed to the Boca Raton Chamber of Commerce and West
Boca Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would just sit there all day,'' Anthony said. ``It was
exciting. We got to find all kinds of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie and Anthony have been avid Internet explorers for several
years, and have not yet tired of finding other people's money for
the sheer fun of it. They began their fiduciary quest in August,
when a friend of the Behlogs from New York said he had found the
family's name on a list of people owed unclaimed cash.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Richie and Anthony were spending their last days before
school searching the www.findcash.com Web site. Besides the $700
belonging to Boca, the brothers turned up $130 belonging to Boca
Raton High and about $600 belonging to the Boca Pops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unclaimed cash'' can come from a variety of sources, according
to a Florida Department of Banking and Finance spokeswoman: ``It
could be anything _ old bank accounts, insurance policies, payroll
checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Since school started, Richie and Anthony have been spending less
time on-line and more time in the classroom. But their late-summer,
on-line exploits have already gained the attention of some
prominent adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, am I ever impressed,'' Hanson wrote in her letter to
Richie. ``You are a wonderful citizen to take the time and trouble
and have the interest to help out our city.''

 &HT;    Hazy air threatens wallets
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A thick concentration of ozone in Austin's
already soupy air approached unhealthy levels again recently,
despite the city's continued calls for residents to cut down on
driving and other activities that can pollute.
</P>
<P>
   High temperatures and stagnant winds combined with vehicle
emissions and other pollution to cause unsafe ozone levels August
30 and 31, the two worst days for the city's air this year. The
previous three days were all declared ``Ozone Action Days,'' the
longest string of such declarations this year.
</P>
<P>
   Experts expect the metro area to be out of compliance with
federal standards for the second straight year, which could
eventually subject the city to expensive federal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday, the city had not had a bad ozone day since June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it looked pretty good until this weekend,'' said Paul
Helliker, executive director of Clean Air Force, the organization
that monitors the city's ozone level. And, he said, ``if you look
back at the information from the previous years, September can be
just as bad as August.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the city recorded unhealthy ozone days twice in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive ozone in the lower atmosphere is already a problem for
people suffering from lung disease or breathing difficulties.
Plants and crops can also be damaged by it.
</P>
<P>
   But the high ozone could become a problem that affects everyone
two years from now, when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
decides whether to toughen pollution controls on vehicles,
industrial equipment and business practices in Austin, as it has in
other cities that couldn't meet safe ozone levels for three years
in a row. Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, El Paso and Beaumont are all
considered out of compliance with clean-air standards and required
to follow strict regulatory programs to limit the amount of ozone
in their air.
</P>
<P>
   Austin already exceeded the safe level for all of last year by
recording four days between April and October on which the average
ozone concentration was 85 parts per billion or higher. If that
happens this year and again in 1999, new rules will take effect
sometime after the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The new requirements could mandate that all vehicles undergo
annual emissions tests, gas stations sell cleaner-burning gasoline
and install equipment to trap gasoline vapors, and small businesses
such as body shops and dry cleaners purchase expensive
pollution-control equipment. Regulations such as these have cost
businesses in other Texas cities hundreds of millions of dollars.
The city may opt to voluntarily comply with some of those rules as
a way of beginning to reduce ozone levels sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already failed last year,'' said Doug Scales, who owns auto
repair shops in Austin and sits on the Clean Air Force board.
``We're going to fail this year. It's almost a foregone conclusion.
If we fail next year, then we're nailed. We need somehow to get the
news out that we need to do this, or it's going to impact the
general public and their pocketbooks.''
</P>
<P>
   The ozone problem is partly our fault, partly Mother Nature's.
</P>
<P>
   Ozone is formed in the lower part of the atmosphere when
volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides _ elements of
vehicle emissions, as well as the emissions of small engines,
gasoline refineries and power plants _ collide in the glow of
sunlight. The steamy temperatures, intense sun and still winds that
are normal for August are the perfect conditions for producing
ozone.
</P>
<P>
   In August, temperatures above 90 degrees and winds of less than
5 miles per hour, on top of an already moderate level of ozone,
trigger an Ozone Action Day, meaning that residents should try to
carpool, ride a bicycle or ride the bus _ which is free on such
days _ to avoid the crowding on the roads that contributes to ozone
buildup.
</P>
<P>
   But the tremendous growth of traffic on Central Texas roads is a
difficult tide to stem, even for only a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't make a trip that I could do otherwise at another
time,'' said Ellen Prediger, who lives in Bastrop and works in
Austin but tries not to leave her house on Ozone Action Days.
``However, there are a lot of people that are completely unaware of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With clouds in the forecast, today is not an ozone action day.

 &HT;    Tobacco starts paying dues
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Klas
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Palm Beach Post Capital Bureau
</P>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ More than a quarter-million uninsured
children in Florida will get health insurance, thanks in part to
Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The $344 million Kidcare program is the largest expansion of
health coverage in state history. The state's share _ $75 million _
comes directly from the tobacco industry coffers and gives
Floridians the first tangible benefit of the state's $11 billion
victory in its landmark lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   About 254,000 children from birth to age 18 who have no health
insurance coverage will be eligible for full or partial state
subsidies under Kidcare, depending on the family income level.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 10,000 classrooms full of kids,'' Gov. Lawton Chiles
said Monday during a teleconference transmitted to hundreds of
health providers, educators and advocates around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The program offers full medical benefits to eligible families,
including doctor visits, hospital care, behavioral health and
emergency services. It will expand the Healthy Kids health
insurance program for school-age children to all counties. It
establishes MediKids, a new insurance program that covers children
from birth to age 5 for families with incomes up to 200 percent of
the poverty level ($32,000 for a family of four.) It expands
Medicaid eligibility for children and covers children with special
health care needs through the Children's Medical Services Network.
</P>
<P>
   Eligible families can apply during an open enrollment between
today Sept. 1 and Nov. 30. Two more 90-day enrollment periods will
be held in 1999. Next to the state's share, the program is paid for
by counties and federal sources, including $209 million from a new
federal program and an expansion of Medicaid. Families will pay
about $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Key to the program's success will be spreading the word. About
25 percent of the families eligible for Medicaid in Florida haven't
applied, health officials estimate. So, to make sure the program
reaches as many of the state's 800,000 uninsured children as
possible, they have earmarked $400,000 for a public information
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The outreach effort will include television and radio ads in
English and Spanish, billboards, handouts at schools, day care
centers, hospitals and public health offices.
</P>
<P>
   The kick-off came Monday with an address by Chiles and Insurance
Commissioner Bill Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are our storm troopers,'' Chiles told the statewide
audience. He said the program, if successful, will make a ``sea
change'' of difference to the uninsured in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money a family will pay to participate in the
program will depend on the program they qualify for and the county
contribution. MediKids families, for example, will pay no more than
$15 a month, regardless of the number of children, and pay no
co-payments.

 &HT;    Scout learns moral lesson -- the hard way
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of two suburban Boca Raton, Florida, Boy Scout troops
learned about heartlessness and charity in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of troops 325 and 350 _ preparing last week for a Labor
Day campout _ discovered someone had stolen about $7,000 worth of
their camping equipment from storage at Boca West Community United
Methodist Church, pastor Joe Jursa said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders discovered the theft while checking gear recently for
the first time since Aug. 1, sheriff's Deputy Claudio Burleigh
said. He said thieves had broken into a storage shed and stole gear
and hauled off a trailer. Taken were nine five-man tents, six
stoves, two tool boxes and a foot locker.
</P>
<P>
   With the campout in jeopardy, another troop offered to loan
equipment. And a local resident who had been an Eagle Scout
anonymously donated $1,000, Jursa said.
</P>
<P>
   The same Scouts had a trailer stolen last year, but several
months later, some of the items mysteriously showed up on the
church doorstep, perhaps after thieves later had an apparent pang
of conscience, Jursa said.
</P>
<P>
   Still missing is Troop 350's original flag, blanketed in service
ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what anybody would do with that, but that has a
lot of significance for the boys,'' Jursa said.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell, who died
last week, was one of the notable conservatives on the bench in the

   GATOR-HUNT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At a half-hour before
sunset, some of the 680 men and women with permits for this year's
state alligator hunt set out with harpoons and bang sticks to bag
as many as five gators apiece. It's illegal to use rifles or
pistols to hunt the reptiles, so many hunters use hooked baits,
harpoons or arrows with lines attached to bring the gators to the

captured, hunters usually use a bang stick to kill them, Hord said.

BLAMING OTHERS FOR THEIR LIES

 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ President Clinton and former Boston Globe
columnist Patricia Smith both suffer from the same syndrome:
It's-not-my-fault-itis. I've had it with both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their lukewarm apologies, I was willing to give both the
benefit of empathy (albeit with a great deal of disappointment).
But their finger-pointing was the last straw.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was especially brazen when he hammered the Watergate
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, for stirring up the water with
his investigation. But Smith really took the cake last weekend when
she declared she was ``the face of American journalism slapping
journalism's American face.''
</P>
<P>
   Reading her poetry at the 1998 National Poetry Slam contest in
Austin, Texas, Smith added that she was a ``source of shame and
embarrassment for those who dutifully keep up the mortgages on
their (expletive) glass houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith flatters herself. She's no tragic hero.
</P>
<P>
   She's a source of shame and embarrassment because she shammed
her readers. Plain and simple.
</P>
<P>
   And while it's quite possible that the profession and those who
counted on her to be their voice could understand, if not quite
forgive her, what does Smith do? She turns around and kicks us in
the ribs with such declarations as, ``I can see the headlines.
`Disgraced, outcast, sinful ex-columnist just doesn't get it.'''
</P>
<P>
   If she doesn't know that you just don't make people up and write
newspaper columns about them, then she's right. She doesn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   And I don't buy the notion that her non-traditional background
as a poet predisposed her to fabricating characters in her columns.
Such a broad brush unfairly paints the journalists who arrived in
the nation's mainstream newsrooms via nontraditional routes.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no excusing Smith for making up people in her
columns, I understood the pressures she was under _ deadlines and
more deadlines, as well as the burden she willingly carried for her
community as a columnist of color. I sadly observed her downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Her performance in Austin arrogantly suggests she's not having
pangs of conscience.
</P>
<P>
   But then, who is these days? Certainly not Clinton, whose
tepidly stated regret about his ``inappropriate relationship'' with
Monica Lewinsky seemed no more sincere than his insistence earlier
this year that, indeed, he did not have sex with ``that woman,
Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Smith's former Globe colleague, Mike Barnicle, who
stubbornly held on to his columnist job earlier this month when his
editors accused him of lifting jokes from comedian George Carlin's
book. He took the Globe and his supporters through the muck and
almost came out smelling like a rose until editors found yet
another problem: Barnicle appeared to have made up characters
featured in a column, the same infraction that brought down Smith.
</P>
<P>
   As have Smith and Clinton, Barnicle left behind an awful stench.
</P>
<P>
   Having been caught in a whopper or two, I know it's hard to
'fess up, pick up your face and keep walking. It's a lonely task
when you have only yourself to blame.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody ever said responsibility was easy.

SOME EXPERTS SEE A RETURN OF THE OIL CRUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oil, the black gold of the world economy, is
almost insanely cheap. Yet it won't be for long, according to a
small but growing band of doomsayers.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a debated theory, they fear world oil demand will begin
to exceed supply as early as about 2010. That might revive sights
not seen since the oil crises of the 1970s: long lines at gas
stations and Saudi Arabian princes buying American skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who wants to drive their motor home up to Alaska
better do it now while the supply of oil is cheap,'' said veteran
oil geologist L.F. ``Buzz'' Ivanhoe. ``It's not a joke. I hope I'm
wrong as hell, but I fear that I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Such claims have sparked a debate among oil geologists,
economists, engineers and industry officials, most of whom insist
there is plenty of oil left for many decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the world is awash in cheap oil. Prices are so low
that they are hastening the collapse of the economy of Russia, a
major oil exporter.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Swenson, a mechanical engineer who is president of
EcoSystems Inc. in Santa Cruz, Calif., uses the World Wide Web to
warn about ``the coming global oil crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   While the American Petroleum Institute insists that the world's
known oil reserves increase every year, Swenson dismisses such talk
as ``a play on words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1973 and today, we have consumed a quarter of the
world's entire endowment of oil from the beginning of history until
the end,'' said Swenson. ``If we've consumed a quarter of our oil
in that time, we don't have more oil, we have less.''
</P>
<P>
   Such fears of a post-millennium oil crunch are ``primarily
bunk,'' said economist Mike Lynch of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Lynch, an expert on oil-supply trends, laughingly
recalls past flubbed forecasts of an oil apocalypse. One of the
leading present doomsayers is Colin Campbell of Petroconsultants in
Geneva who, Lynch said, ``predicted in a 1989 article ... that
world (oil) production had peaked ... and that the price would go
to $40 to $50 (a barrel) in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now,'' Lynch said, ``it's about $12 to $13.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fate of oil supplies is starting to attract attention in the
scientific community. ``The Next Oil Crisis Looms Large _ and
Perhaps Close,'' is the headline on a four-page story in the Aug.
21 issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Pessimists like Ivanhoe ``gained a powerful ally this spring
when the Paris-based International Energy Agency of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported for
the first time that the peak of world oil production is in sight,''
said author Richard Kerr.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kerr, even with exploitation of huge new reservoirs
such as the Caspian Sea, some experts think that ``between 2010 and
2020 the gush of oil from wells around the world will peak at 80
million barrels per day, then begin a steady, inevitable decline
...''
</P>
<P>
   The latest projections are based partly on a controversial
forecasting tool developed in the 1950s by M. King Hubbert of the
U.S. Geological Survey, who died a decade ago. Hubbert forecast _
correctly _ that the nation's oil production would peak about 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbert's disciples have updated his calculations by using
high-speed computers and far richer databases. They argue that oil
demand will begin to exceed supply sometime in the next two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But Lynch called the Hubbert curve simplistic, and said it
relied on assumptions that don't work.
</P>
<P>
   While oil-supply forecasting is extremely difficult and
complicated by political choices and unexpected global events,
Lynch expects the world to have enough oil for the next 300 years.
He said new technologies would allow oil geologists to extract fuel
from unappealing crustal sources, such as tar sands and oil shale
in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and many other economists overrate the promise of
technology, Swenson said. Rather than trying to find ways to
exploit oil shale and tar sands, he would prefer to develop
alternative energy sources such as solar and wind power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't just the `left-wing kooks' who say this,'' said
Swenson, who has written about the subject for a conservative
periodical, National Interest. ``These economists are not grounded
in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation should begin preparing for an oil crunch _ perhaps by
developing oil resources or alternative energy sources _ lest a
future price surge severely damage the world economy, said Ivanhoe,
who coordinates activities at the M. King Hubbert Center for
Petroleum Supply Studies at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the captain on the Titanic had had a few hours to change
his course, he wouldn't have run into the iceberg,'' Ivanhoe said.
``It's when he doesn't have enough time to prepare that all hell
breaks loose.''

SOCIAL SECURITY KEEPS ON TICKIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Look at it this way: At least the Republicans
have quit talking about giving people ``personal responsibility''
over their Social Security money, and letting them invest it in the
stock market. Kiss that one goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   In their rush to wipe out the legacy of Franklin D. Roosevelt,
the Republicans overlooked the fact that Social Security was
invented in 1935 as part of a package of reforms after a certain
notorious market free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't just Republicans who were bullish on
putting Social Security into the market. Just a couple of months
ago, Sen. John B. Breaux, D-La., said, ``The goal of this is to
have people more involved in their savings.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, we're a little too involved with our savings, and
would just as soon leave Social Security out of it.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few of us who don't play the stock market, and
don't even want to know what's in our 401(k)s.
</P>
<P>
   On Gray Monday, President Clinton was on Air Force One on his
way to Russia to meet with Boris Yeltsin, the one world leader in
bigger trouble than Clinton is.
</P>
<P>
   While in the air Clinton reassured the American people on the
American economy, not by talking to us directly, but by speaking to
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who then spoke those dread words,
``Our economy remains sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also relayed his desire for Northwest Airlines and the
pilots union to settle their strike, speaking from Air Force One to
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this the plot of one of those Armageddon movies? You know,
where the president is in Air Force One while the nation lies
devastated below?
</P>
<P>
   And he's going to Russia to boost the spirits of Yeltsin? Maybe
they should change places. But then, only Monica would know the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I have no idea how much I lost in my IRAs and 401(k) in
recent days, but on Sunday I lost a recurring column topic. It's
not as bad as San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown abdicating or Bill
Clinton deciding to stay in Russia, but it does represent the loss
of one column a year.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half years after citing unnamed sources who said the
San Francisco Examiner would be dead in about a week, the San Jose
Mercury News retracted its story.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. Congratulations to Managing Editor David
Yarnold on his Clintonian skill in not quite retracting the Mercury
News' premature obituary on the Examiner and not apologizing. He
just said his newspaper didn't do a very good job of ``following
up.''
</P>
<P>
   He even said, ``If we had it to do all over again, given what we
knew at the time, we'd run the same story.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be true. It's also true that if Clinton had it to do
all over again, given what he knew at the time, he'd still say he
wasn't having sexual relations with that woman.
</P>
<P>
   Yarnold did say that ``when events don't unfold the way we
predict, we owe readers closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, what a Clintonian word, that ``closure.'' Why does the
managing editor provide closure now? Probably because we've been
bugging his boss, the executive editor, for 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, thanks to the Mercury News for the late closure on the
story of the Examiner's non-closure. Now it's time to start
worrying about bigger things, like the closure of everyone's jobs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _____ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least our sports heroes provide some relief. Mike Tyson's
wife drove a Mercedes into the car in front of her. Mike jumped out
to fight the other car's driver, and had to be restrained by his
entourage. Maybe his entourage told him to wait until Don King
arrived to sign a contract with the other driver, and get him to
fall down faster.
</P>
<P>
   How come Tyson still has an entourage, anyway? I thought he was
broke. Is this a volunteer entourage, or entourage interns, or
something?
</P>
<P>
   Then we have Latrell Sprewell, who is refiling a case in federal
court, among other things protesting the NBA's punishment of him
for choking coach P.J. Carlesimo. Sprewell wants his fines capped
at $1 million. Look, we've already heard of salary caps, but a
punishment cap? Bring back the dunce cap.

   It doesn't take a psychic to see that the film has staying power

to come. This danged boat will be floating off the coast of
mainstream America until the next Ice Age. Assuming there is one.
</P>
<P>
   So, take heart, Leo freaks! Be cheered, film aficionados!
(Titanifans? Titaninerds? Titanawannabes?).
</P>
<P>
   Already in stores are Leo biographies, Kate biographies,
calendars, T-shirts, posters and CDs _ including ``Back to
Titanic,'' a second installment of music drawn from the movie, this
one featuring a weepy, dialogue-sopped version of ``My Heart Will
Go On.'' Like, we needed it.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. There's more. With a rub of the crystal ball, we can
foresee decade after decade of ``Titanic'' merchandise, ``Titanic''
sequels, ``Titanic'' pencil boxes and ``Titanic'' Rose 'n' Jack
embroidered dish towels. With a mere touch of prophetic insight, we
can envision a parade of dolls, Styrofoam cup warmers, party
plates, gas-station giveaways, baseball caps, tattoos and Mylar
party balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a time, 20 or 30 years from now, when a holographic Rose
and Jack will hover, forever clutching, above the traffic in Times
Square. Imagine a ``Titanic'' hot line where operators role-play
characters in the film. Imagine a ``Titanic'' support group where
recovering fans help each other make it, Leo-free.
</P>
<P>
   And, while we're at it, imagine this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Comic books in which Jack and Rose are sullen young
21st-century nihilists who mutate into brawny superheroes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jack and Rose action figures. Jack's comes with a miniature
ax.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Titanic: The Insipid Sitcom.'' Jack and Rose are alive and
well and sipping latte in suburban L.A. in this cute, sexy
30-minute show from the creators of ``Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Titanic: The Rickety Wooden Roller Coaster.'' At this
brand-spanking-new Great Escape attraction, riders are turned
upside and dumped into freezing waters at the Splashwater Kingdom,
where they are left to die of exposure.

ROSACEA, NOT EMBARRASSMENT, MAKES CLINTON RED IN THE FACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just because President Clinton is walking around a little
red-faced, doesn't mean we should jump to any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   During his re-election campaign two years ago, his doctors
released statements indicating that he takes a prescription
medication for rosacea, a skin condition that, at best, makes you
look as if you are blushing.
</P>
<P>
   Characterized by redness on the cheeks, nose, chin or forehead,
rosacea has become increasingly widespread as 76 million baby
boomers enter their 30s, 40s and 50s. It most often strikes
fair-skinned people of Northern European descent, especially
English and Irish, and now affects an estimated 13 million people
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Other famous rosacea sufferers have been W.C. Fields, Princess
Diana and J.P. Morgan. A recent Gallup survey, however, found that
78 percent of Americans have no knowledge of the red-faced disease.
</P>
<P>
   Rosacea usually starts as a flush or blush and can progress to
bumps and pimples and dilated blood vessels that become visible on
the surface of the face. It can also cause swelling of the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of confusion among the public about skin
problems in adulthood,'' says Dr. Jerome Z. Litt, assistant
clinical professor of dermatology at Case Western Reserve
University. ``One of the most widespread and least-known facial
disorders during maturity is rosacea, which can be altogether as
devastating as acne is for a teen-ager before the prom.''
</P>
<P>
   The underlying cause is still unknown, but anything that dilates
the blood vessels can trigger the ``flush and blush'' of rosacea,
Litt said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Emotional stress is one of the most common rosacea triggers.
Others are sun exposure, hot weather, spicy foods, strenuous
exercise, hot drinks, alcoholic beverages, cold weather and wind,
according to the National Rosacea Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing to do is see a dermatologist and get it under
control,'' Litt says. ``It will be with you for the rest of your
life, but you can keep it under control with oral antibiotics and
topical antibiotic gels and by avoiding those things that trigger
flare-ups.''
</P>
<P>

the National Rosacea Society at 800 S. Northwest Highway, Suite
200, Barrington, IL 60010 or call (888) NO-BLUSH.

TEN NEW FACES FOR THE NEW SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next media darling after Ally what's her name? Easy one.
It's Keri Russell. Young, cute, smart, romantically challenged,
semi-psychotic. Proud owner of a name that grows on you but you
wouldn't dare name your kid. Targeted to the WB's bread-and-butter
audience: teens, young adults, mid-life crisis sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' is the series and the name, but you won't miss or
forget the face, particularly what she does with it.
</P>
<P>
   Russell is one of a few worth checking out in a season being
hammered for offering lukewarm to bad shows. Bright side: Even if
the shows from our annual 10 Faces to Watch list don't make it (and
many probably won't), chances are you'll see these folks again,
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Keri Russell, ``Felicity,'' WB _ A good actress in lousy shows,
she got a bad rap for the soapish ``Malibu Shores'' and sitcom
``Daddy's Girls.'' Literally carries ``Felicity'' as a 18-year-old
college freshman navigating freedom, pain, friendship, love. Most
expressive eyes on TV.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sean Hayes, ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' NBC _ Witty, warm and hilarious as
Jack, the neurotic, outspoken, borderline obsessive-compulsive
buddy of Eric McCormack's Will. ``Will &AMP; Grace'' is a snappy sitcom
that moves well, but Hayes is the guy pulling the train. Just what
you'd expect from someone whose bio says he relaxes by ``playing
hopscotch.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sue Costello, ``Costello,'' Fox _ Shetalksalittlelikethis. And
with a Boston accent. Can't understand her most of the time, but
since everyone else is laughing. ... Her self-titled sitcom is set
in a Boston bar where she's able to dress everyone down with
one-liners flowing out like machine gun fire. It's hard to write
for stand-ups, to get them in their element. Costello is in her
element here.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   D.L. Hughley, ``The Hughleys,'' ABC _ Stand-up comedian who
stands out no matter who's in the room. Super-quick with one-liners
loaded with observational musings designed to make you
uncomfortable, Hughley has a treasure chest of stuff for his new
sitcom about a black family venturing gingerly into a largely white
suburb. Oh, boy.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Brian Benben, ``The Brian Benben Show,'' CBS _ Might remember
him from HBO's terrific ``Dream On.'' Surely you remember that
name. One of the best at playing the cuddly, vulnerable type who's
always forgiven because he's so darn funny. Here he's a bitter
reporter trying to regain his anchor status. Perfectly suited for
Benben.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Hung, ``Martial Law,'' CBS _ Hong Kong action star built
like a bowling ball. You'll marvel at his martial arts abilities
and laugh as a law enforcer who wobbles when he runs. Could become
the Jackie Chan of American TV.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Moira Kelly, ``To Have &AMP; To Hold,'' CBS _ Fine film actress who
dances well between drama and comedy. She absolutely smolders in
this romantic drama about a public defender and a Boston detective
trying to keep personal and professional matters in check. A weekly
date with her isn't a bad deal.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Lane, ``Encore! Encore!,'' NBC _ Seldom seen on TV, but
this face is well known to film and theater audiences. Perhaps one
of the best actors working, comedy or drama, gay or straight.
Playing a somewhat snooty uppercrust in this sitcom is to-die-for
casting. One of the few who makes you laugh out loud.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Felicity Huffman, ``Sports Night,'' ABC _ Her treatment of the
strong, quick-witted producer on this sitcom about a cable sports
show appears so fresh it must be close to her off-screen
personality. Huffman stands out among a fine cast of players in a
series that could very well be the sleeper of the season.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Mila Kunis, ``That '70s Show,'' Fox _ When she explained her
character on this sitcom as ``a misunderstood spoiled brat ... but
you'll find she's just very controlling,'' you knew Kunis was
something special. Moved to Los Angeles from Russia at age 7. Her
teen-age Jackie in the series is considered something of a
supporter among a large ensemble cast. Let's see how long that
lasts.

VAN DAMME LOOKS BEYOND HIS KARATE FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A lot of these movie tough guys travel with
bodyguards, not so much because they are trying to come off like
jerks, but more that they are likely to attract jerks.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Claude Van Damme, however, ``The Muscles from Brussels,''
shrugs off the thought with one of those little European downward
turns of the mouth and slight shrug.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, sometimes he might run into some drunken lout who wants to
score some points with his friends by kicking Van Damme's Belgian
butt. Except that it's not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will just talk my way out of it,'' says Van Damme, sitting
in a downstairs room at Planet Hollywood in San Francisco to
promote his latest action flick, ``Knock Off'' (opening Friday).
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can't talk my way out of it, I will just leave. I can't
be getting into fights, because I will always lose. If I lose, then
I lose. And if I win, then I lose, too. I prefer to make friends,
shake some hands,'' he continues, dressed in a casually chic manner
with a starched white shirt, linen shorts and wire-rimmed glasses.
``If I start having bodyguards, I have no freedom. It is not worth
it to me. I like people.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Damme has been making his karate movies since 1987. Low
budget head knockers such as ``Bloodsport'' and ``Lionheart'' were
long on flying fists and short on dialogue. As the money kept
rolling in, Van Damme started making more studio films, slicker
looking versions with largely the same formula: No problem is too
big for the sleek-looking Van Damme to tackle, all the while
keeping his pretty face intact and his hair nicely gelled. It may
not be Olivier, but it keeps the actor in endives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock Off'' was directed by Tsui Hark and filmed in Hong Kong.
The plot revolves around a Russian Mafia scheme to bring microbombs
to the terrorist black market planted in knock-off designer jeans _
hence the title. It probably sounded a lot better to the movie's
financiers than ``Microbomb.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Van Damme said the Hong Kong shooting schedule was
grueling, although he did get to do a lot of his own stunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hong Kong, things are a lot more free. I have been training
for years, so it is good to be able to do many things physically,''
he says, his English accented with traces of the French and Flemish
he also speaks. ``In the U.S., they do not like you to do your
stunts, because there are insurance problems and such. If you get
hurt, the production has to be shut down and you can put a lot of
people out of work. It would not be a good move for your career,''
he adds with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   What many people don't know about Van Damme is that he was once
asked to join the Paris Opera as a dancer. As a young man, he
trained almost as heavily in ballet as in the martial arts. Being a
man's man, he is confident enough to have no fear of tutu jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was more the old rules, that a man had to be only
macho,'' he says. ``Now, you can be strong and sensitive. Ballet is
wonderful training for footwork and balance _ it complements
martial arts quite well. And no one can tell me that someone like
Baryshnikov was not an athlete. It is hard to keep such a calm
expression on your face when you do such physical exertion. It is
hard to keep your leg up in the air like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, Van Damme will be 38. He knows enough about his body
to understand that he may not always be able to battle the forces
of evil with quite as much gusto as he is now able to summon. With
that in mind, he is looking to broaden the range of his acting in
some future projects for his own production company. He hints that
his subsequent roles will display more depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be wild and sexy and cynical. They will not be Van
Damme movies. Well, actually, they will,'' he says, quickly
correcting himself, ``because that is how I am in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Van Damme generally trains for three hours a day, at least five
days a week. He continued to do this in Hong Kong during the
filming of ``Knock Off.'' In Hong Kong, he was often on the set for
16 hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the film, I seem a little bit tired,'' he
recalls. ``That is because I am tired. That was a lot of work, but
it was worth it. After we were done, I totally let myself go. I did
not go to the gym for two-and-a-half weeks!''
</P>
<P>
   With that shocking confession, Van Damme was ready to sign some
autographs for his fans and catch a plane for Minneapolis, where he
was anxious to see the Mall of America, billed as the world's
biggest mall. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it is really something,'' Van Damme says.

SOME WORLD WAR I VETERANS ARE STILL WITH US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: How many soldiers are still alive from the First World War?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.R.K., Harvard, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Out of 4.73 million Americans who served during World War I,
an estimated 3,200 are alive today. They range in age from 94 to
116.
</P>
<P>
   These figures come from Muriel Sue Parkhurst, who
single-handedly runs Veterans of World War I of the USA Inc. from
her Alexandria, Va., home. When she began working for the
organization in 1975, it had 21 full-time employees working for
750,000 surviving veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Parkhurst said that most of these vets never received pensions
or other benefits, and many retired before Social Security. They
sometimes seek help with eyeglasses, hearing aids, discharge papers
and the return of stolen medals. To contact the group, write to Box
8027, Alexandria, VA 22306-8027, or call (703) 780-5660.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for these men and women to realize they're not
alone,'' Parkhurst said. Subscriptions to the group's newsletter
are sent for donations of $5 or more, which fund its bimonthly
publication.
</P>
<P>
   World War I survivors are the nation's oldest group of veterans.
The last Spanish-American War veteran died in 1992 at age 106, and
the last Civil War veteran died in 1956 at 112, according to
Veterans Administration records.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the red-haired actress Anita Morris? I
thought she died, but what's her story? She was so talented.
</P>
<P>
   _ T.S.N, Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Morris died of cancer at age 50 on March 3, 1994, in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years on Broadway, the actress was a Drama Desk Award
winner and Tony Award nominee for her role in the 1982 Broadway
musical ``Nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Her movie projects included ``The Hotel New Hampshire,''
``Ruthless People'' and ``Radioland Murders,'' which was released
posthumously.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine called her best role that of ``Danny DeVito's
scheming, Dustbuster-addicted mistress in `Ruthless People.'''

NET WORTHS TAKE A HIT IN HIGH-TECH WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Bill Gateses and Larry Ellisons of the world
had a very rough day, losing billions of dollars as many technology
and Internet-related stocks took a big hit on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The personal stock holdings of Gates, the founder of Microsoft
Corp., dropped a stunning $2.5 billion from the time the Nasdaq
market closed Friday to the end of the day Monday. The wealth the
Oracle Corp.'s Ellison had dipped $1 billion between Aug. 20 and
the end of the day Monday, based on compensation figures from
recent federal reports.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is dominated by technology stocks, the Nasdaq
Composite index has fallen the hardest in the recent sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. technology stocks have suffered the most because many of
their investors bought on speculation of future earnings. And, not
surprisingly, the most speculative companies _ such as America
Online and Amazon.com Inc. _ have been among those with the worst
bruises.
</P>
<P>
   American Online fell $14.31 to $81.94 in trading of 14.1 million
shares on Monday. That drop cut AOL's market value by nearly $3.1
billion and by nearly $12 billion from last month, when the shares
reached a high of $136.13. Amazon.com Inc., the on-line book
seller, had its biggest one-day percentage drop Monday, falling
$22.39 to $83.50.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, founder and editor of the California Technology
Stock Letter in Half Moon Bay, said the technology market was in
for a long ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``These bigger names like Microsoft ... and Cisco were holding
the index up, making it look good,'' he said. ``Now, those big
names that have held up all the way along finally cracked.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Murphy, this is all part of the messy process of
making the transition from a bull market to a bear market. But when
the dust settles, Murphy envisions a market dominated not by
companies like McDonald's and Coca-Cola, but a new brand of
blue-chip leaders _ Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Dell Computer, Intel
and related technology-companies.
</P>
<P>
   He said the large computer companies would prevail because
non-technology corporation would need to keep up with technology to
survive. But he expects the tech casualties in this transition to
be many of the Internet-related companies that have yet to turn
solid profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in an environment where people are not willing to pay
for companies that don't make money,'' he said. ``That's always
true of a bear market.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Parr, an Internet analyst for International Data Corp.,
still had strong hopes for the leaders in the Internet market, such
as Yahoo Inc. Yahoo took a dramatic downturn Monday, falling $14.06
to $69 at the market's close Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate of the drop has certainly been pretty sickening, but
we're still up over where we were a year ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parr said he believed the hardest companies to be hit would be
those smaller companies that were planning to go public. ``A lot of
those that wanted to go public will be looking to be acquired
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for those personally hit, most analysts had little sympathy
for the founders and chief executives of the top technology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Executive compensation expert Leon Farley said money was not
what drove the top computer executives. ``The people who lead
companies lead companies because that's what they're destined to
do,'' said Farley, founder of Leon A. Farley Associates, an
executive search firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think Bill Gates is losing sleep being worth, say, $5
billion less? I don't think so,'' said Martin Reynolds, vice
president of technology assessment for Dataquest Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds said he expected one of the major downsides of the tech
stock slide would be losing the draw of stock options as a way to
attract and keep good talent.

   HOUSTON _ Don Minzenmayer collects corkscrews. He's collected so
many corkscrews that the cabinets and drawers in his two-story home
overflow with them.
</P>
<P>
   So many, in fact, that he built on a room to accommodate them
all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time my daughter counted, I had around 3,000, but
I've gotten more since then,'' says Minzenmayer, leading the way
into his corkscrew emporium, an airy, high-ceilinged bar/den that
resembles a medieval torture chamber until you remember all those
sharp, curling, sadistic-looking objects are for opening wine, not
extracting confessions.

</P>
<P>
   More than you ever thought you needed to know. Because, like
everything else, corkscrews have a history. People started making
them a long, long time ago and, like everything else, they've
evolved.
</P>
<P>
   Minzenmayer, 63, a tall, mellow-voiced retired architect with
huge, knuckly hands and a slightly embarrassed smile, can tell you
all about them. He is a corkscrew maven. He's written the book on
corkscrews. Well, maybe not ``the book,'' but two impressive
articles on corkscrews, which earned him prestigious awards from an
international corkscrew association. (You didn't know there was an
international corkscrew association, did you?)
</P>
<P>
   And it all started with _ you were expecting something else? _ a
corkscrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had these two couples over for dinner one night,'' he says,
smiling fondly at the memory, ``and they'd each brought a bottle of
wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Minzenmayer, playing host, proceeded to open one of the bottles,
using a garden-variety bottle-opener/corkscrew and his own
admittedly workmanlike skill. Then disaster struck: The screw broke
off in the cork. An increasingly frustrated (and mortified)
Minzenmayer employed a range of tools _ pliers, screwdrivers,
knives _ to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ended up driving the cork into the bottle,'' he says,
wincing at the memory of such outright cork abuse.
</P>
<P>
   That Christmas, friends and family members, winking and
grinning, gave Minzenmayer 12 corkscrews as gifts. That was 1972.
It so happened that his wife, Betty, was already an avid collector
of vintage beaded purses and music boxes. So Minzenmayer started
accompanying her on jaunts to antiques shops and flea markets. He
bought a corkscrew here. A corkscrew there.
</P>
<P>
   Today, antique corkscrews from England, France, Germany and
other lands rest inside a glass-topped display case that doubles as
the top of a wraparound island bar in his corkscrew salon. Others
rest inside antique glass display cases. Soon, he says, another
display case will hang high on the wall; track lighting is already
trained on where it will go. About everywhere you look, there are
corkscrews.
</P>
<P>
   He owns elegant, filigreed English corkscrews from the 18th
century. Corkscrews with handles made of brass and bone, antelope
and boar tusk. Old-style, pub corkscrews _ called bar screws
because they clamped onto the bar _ that resemble telescopes and
opened wine quickly for exhausted barmaids. Modern, stylish,
ultrahip corkscrews in red and black. Double-lever corkscrews and
waiter's corkscrews. Cheese corkscrews and lady's perfume bottle
corkscrews. Corkscrews shaped like knives and bullets, pigs and
birds. And devils. Corkscrews so pretty they could be folk art.
</P>
<P>
   Minzenmayer can talk about corkscrews until the grapes ripen on
the vine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one here has a little bell on top, so you could tell if
the maid was snitching your brandy,'' he says, chuckling at the
ingenuity of it. (The screw stayed in the cork and tinkled to
betray trespassers.)
</P>
<P>
   An entire section of the main display case is filled with
turn-of-the-century American wood-handled corkscrews, many branded
with beer names. Back then, Minzenmayer explains, beer bottles
lacked twist tops. You had to use corkscrews. Often, cases of beer
came with ``gratis'' openers. The heyday of corkscrew invention was
the 19th century, he says, when a veritable patent war raged, with
inventors copying each other &UR;  &LR; but making subtle changes to avoid
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Minzenmayer points out some of his rare specimens _ a ``very
old'' Laguiole corkscrew, used by vineyard workers in France (a
combination vine-cutting knife/corkscrew); a Sheffield multipurpose
corkscrew, complete with a tool to pick stones out of a horse's
hoof; an 1892 English pocketknife corkscrew with a flint striker
for lighting fires.
</P>
<P>
   Minzenmayer owns several versions of the Davis, the first
American-patented corkscrew, and the original prototype of a
Teflon-coated ``screw pull'' devised by legendary oil field
inventor Herb Allen. The screw pull's invention in 1979 was the
first breakthrough in corkscrew design in ages, he says, and
apparently rocked the corkscrew world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one was a real find for me,'' Minzenmayer says, pointing
to an ornate English bar screw he found covered in aluminum paint
at an antiques shop. It's the elusive Yankee 6. Everyone knew about
the Yankee 7, he says, but no one had ever found a Yankee 6,
although collectors knew it existed _ there was a picture of it in
the 1902 Sears' catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I found one in Comanche, Texas,'' he says, smiling
triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chase is all part of the fun,'' adds Minzenmayer, although
it was more fun 15 years ago, before big-time dealers got involved
and started driving up auction prices. Nowadays, he says, folks who
own major wine cellars and who ``just want to have a few antiques
around'' are willing to spend big bucks for vintage corkscrews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hurt us a bit,'' says Minzenmayer. ``It makes
(corkscrews) harder to find, and it's put them out of reach for
most of us. And we've written the books.''
</P>
<P>
   He refers to fellow members of the International Correspondence
of Corkscrew Addicts, a worldwide group that meets once a year in a
different country ostensibly to discuss corkscrews but really to
drink wine, eat, travel and enjoy each other's fellowship. Made up
of professionals and wine lovers _ doctors, lawyers, architects,
college professors _ the ICCA, formed in 1974, is exclusive. You
must have a ``world class'' corkscrew collection to join, says
Minzenmayer, who learned of it through a magazine but had to wait
for someone to die to be let in.
</P>
<P>
   Through the group, perpetually capped at 50 members to keep
things cozy, Minzenmayer and his wife have sipped wine under
50-foot redwood trees in the Napa Valley with Brother Timothy
Diener, the cellar master of the Christian Brother's winery, and
dined at the Italian estate of a genuine Medici descendant. He's
drunk fine brandy on a ferry crossing the English Channel, and
lunched at a chateau in France ``where there were still cannonballs
on the ground'' from the French Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of a German friend he met through the ICCA,
Minzenmayer discovered his family roots hark to 15th-century
Germany and span generations of ``weingartners.'' He even unearthed
his ancestral coat of arms _ a crest featuring a guy holding grapes
in one hand and a vine cutter in the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in my genes, and I didn't even know it,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Minzenmayer actually owns his own vineyard _ a small, two-acre
tract in Brenham, Texas, situated on 30 acres of land. He's been a
home winemaker since 1970, and can wax at length about such topics
as root louse disease and varietal blends. (Currently, four large,
glass casks of red wine rest invitingly in his corkscrew salon.)
He's also partner with Bob Cottle in the Pleasant Hill Winery, a
fledgling operation next to his vineyard that recently enjoyed its
``first crush,'' Minzenmayer says. The winery also displays another
100 of his corkscrews, an attraction that invariably evokes comment
from visitors, says grape-grower Cottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very impressed,'' he says. ``Most people don't think
there are that many different types of corkscrews, let alone that
someone would have a collection that's so vast. It's just
incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Vast, yet ``no two are exactly alike,'' says Minzenmayer.
Therein lies the allure. A corkscrew's value stems from both its
age and rarity, he says. For safety reasons, he won't reveal how
much his collection is worth. His most valuable? Probably the
Chinnock, an American corkscrew patented in 1863 and one of only
two in existence today.
</P>
<P>
   But what really draws Minzenmayer to the spirally objects isn't
their investment values but their human histories. The stories
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   He points to a simple-looking corkscrew given to him by a
pediatrician friend, who had found it in an old trunk. Turns out,
it belonged to the doctor's great-great-grandfather, a surgeon
during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   And this one here is a black French survival knife/corkscrew, he
says. Minzenmayer bought it from a former helicopter pilot, who had
gotten it from a French soldier he rescued running through the
jungle, hotly pursued by the enemy. Covered in blood and mud,
crying, the soldier thrust the corkscrew _ his sole remaining
possession _ at the pilot. A gift in exchange for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Minzenmayer's eyes tear, his voice quavers as he tells this
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just has a whole lot of meaning for me,'' he says.
</P>

CALLS FOR CHANGE CHALLENGE LONG-SERVING KOHL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELIZABETH NEUFFER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COTTBUS, Germany _ There is a strong sense of deja vu in
watching Helmut Kohl, Germany's chancellor for the last 16 years,
lumber onto a stage at a campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's 300-pound girth is as constant as his politics. On the
stump again, his speech here is filled with cliches and familiar
themes, such as his call for Germany ``to continue the course'' of
his chancellorship.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's predictability has long been the appeal of the
68-year-old, who is seeking an unprecedented fifth term as
Germany's leader. As head of the ruling Christian Democratic Party,
he has symbolized stability and success. But now, as Germany reels
from record unemployment and a stumbling economy, polls suggest
that Germany's 60.5 million voters will choose change over
predictability in parliamentary elections next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to redecorate your apartment every once in a while,
and what you do at home you have to do in politics,'' said Werner
Szezina, 54, a self-employed businessman who says the Kohl era is
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``People know changes have to be made,'' said Manfred Guellner
of the Forsa Institute, a polling organization. According to
Guellner's polls, Kohl's party trails the opposition Social
Democratic Party 38 percent to 42 percent. The Social Democrats are
led by a man now favored to be Germany's next chancellor, 54
year-old Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   Change is at the heart of this year's election in Germany, one
of the most critical in decades in a country once known as Europe's
economic wonder. At a time when Germany stands ready to join with
the rest of Europe in adopting a single currency, it is suffering
from a host of economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is at its highest level since World War II, with 11
percent jobless in the west and 20 percent in the former East
Germany. Labor costs are among the highest in the world, rendering
Germany increasingly uncompetitive in the global economy. Taxes
remain high and the budget deficit is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Germans are beginning to confront the nightmare they
have long avoided: slashing the generous social welfare benefits
that made them the envy of Europe. President Roman Herzog warned
last year of the need for radical change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing and it is not waiting for Germany,'' he
told a group of shocked businessmen and politicians. ``Our country
needs a shake-up.''
</P>
<P>
   But where memories remain of the last major political shake-up _
the rise of the Nazi party _ change may be more attractive as an
idea than reality. With a month left before the elections on Sept.
27, almost a quarter of German voters remain undecided.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, some political analysts caution that it is too
early to write Kohl's political obituary, despite polls that show
Schroeder's popularity rating far higher than his. Kohl, a master
party politician, has repeatedly come from behind in the past to
win elections.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that many Germans can conceive of no other leader.
``You have to vote for the fat one!'' yelled one elderly voter
here, hobbling toward Kohl's campaign rally at the Cottbus market
square Monday night. Kohl himself stresses that he is now Europe's
longest serving political leader, underscoring his ties to world
leaders in speeches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still unclear if Kohl will lose,'' said Manfred
Goetemaker, a historian at Potsdam University. ``There is a
widespread feeling among the electorate that Kohl will lose, but
this may be wishful thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor is particularly unpopular among Germany's younger
generation, who watch their futures dwindle as unemployment
statistics rise.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech here, Kohl was repeatedly heckled by young
people, some barely old enough to vote, shouting ``Kohl must go!''
and ``Retire!'' In Berlin, grafitti defacing a Kohl poster echoed
the same theme. ``Youth instead of age'' was scrawled across the
chancellor's face.
</P>
<P>
   Age is a factor. Voters between the ages of 21 and 44 are the
largest demographic bloc in this election _ almost 26 million
voters. Kohl, like their grandparents, is someone they have known
all their lives. ``To these voters, this is not democracy, but a
dictatorship,'' said pollster Guellner.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schroeder has cast himself as the youthful
candidate of centrist change along the lines of Bill Clinton or
British Prime Minister Tony Blair. He has put a conservative face
on the once left-wing Social Democratic Party, and his campaign
pledges vary little from those of Kohl. Both promise to curb
welfare spending, boost jobs, and improve the economy while
protecting Germany's most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters already see Schroeder as chancellor. ``Schroeder?
He's better than Kohl, and it's obvious he will become the new
chancellor,'' said Thomas Preibisch, a 24-year-old student here.
Preibisch is so confident the Social Democrats will win that he
plans to vote for the Party of Democratic Socialism, the eastern
ex-communist party.
</P>
<P>
   While Germans from the east make up only one-fifth of the
country's population, their votes are crucial nonetheless. Kohl's
last two victories have depended heavily on support from eastern
voters. In 1990, riding the post-unification euphoria, Kohl and the
Christian Democrats garnered more than 40 percent of the eastern
vote. Today, polls show Kohl can barely count on 25 percent support
for his party.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, one need only stroll through Cottbus, an
industrial city of 116,000 on the Polish border.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, Kohl's promises that unification would lead to
``blooming landscapes'' and economic revival in the east appear to
have been borne out. New hotels and department stores glisten in
the city center, and renovated homes are clustered near downtown
squares, which are kept spotless.
</P>
<P>
   But behind these cheery facades are the unemployed _ about 18
percent of the population. To them, Kohl is now the chancellor of
``broken promises,'' a man who promised an economic boom that has
yet to occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kohl's got no chance with me,'' said 61-year-old Hans Schwarz,
a retired worker. ``He's turned our area into one of poverty and
misery. We have 6,000 young people who can't even find vocational
training.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, some of those young Germans waved signs, reading:
``Joblessness, No Thanks!''
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign enters its final weeks, many analysts predict
the emergence of a ``grand coalition'' between Schroeder and his
Social Democrats and Kohl and his Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of opposing each other's reforms, the two parties would
agree on a platform of change to boost Germany's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a coalition may be Germany's best hope for change, some
say. ``Only a grand coalition chancellor can make sweeping
changes,'' said historian Goetemaker.
</P>
<P>
   But Kohl and the Christian Democrats have dismissed that option.
Instead, Kohl is campaigning hard, hoping that once again he can
prove Germany's political pundits wrong by winning an election they
predicted he would lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think back for a while, you'll come to realize that
Helmut Kohl was right,'' said Kohl as he recited his
accomplishments to a smattering of applause and catcalls. A chilly
evening descended on Cottbus. ``Let us continue the course we have
embarked on.''

MANGOES OFTEN DO BETTER IN CONTAINERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Q: I love to take fruit seeds and see if I can grow
plants from them. I have a mango plant about 6 inches tall that has
large, glossy leaves. I also have an apricot about 6 feet tall. Is
it possible to plant the mango in the ground?
</P>
<P>
   A: You could plant it in the ground, but you would need to
carefully protect it in winter. You may find it easier to provide
such protection if you maintain your mango in a container.
</P>
<P>
   Mango trees are evergreens that grow 60 or more feet tall in
tropical regions. The tree will fruit four to six years after
planting, and it needs hot, dry periods to set and produce a fruit
crop. Container-grown mangoes will get large but, of course, not
that large, and are less likely to produce fruit. If you do
eventually get fruit, it will take as long as eight years, and the
quality of fruit from seedling plants varies. Chances for mango
blooms increase about the third year. Meanwhile, the foliage is
attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The mango is high in vitamins A and C and potassium.
</P>
<P>
   In order for your trees to survive and reach bearing age, you
will have to take steps to protect them from a hard freeze. Mangoes
are hardy only to about 30 degrees. But Houston gardeners
occasionally report their mangoes produce after a mild winter.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that the mango, which is related to poison ivy,
contains a caustic sap, and touching the skin of the fruit can
trigger irritation.
</P>
<P>
   For those wishing to try, mangoes can be grown from seed taken
from store-bought fruit. The seed should be washed and planted
immediately in a container. Germination time varies. Once a seed is
sown with the tip just beneath the soil, place the container in a
warm, moist area. Mangoes need humidity, and you may find it
necessary to mist your plants as they grow to avoid brown tips on
the leaves. The seedlings will like our heat, but protect them from
hot afternoon sun.
</P>
<P>
   When the seedlings are 6 inches tall, transplant them into
6-inch pots. Provide good light and keep the soil moist, but make
sure there is good drainage. A mixture of equal parts compost,
clean sand and good potting soil will help ensure good drainage as
well as provide nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Fertilize mangoes during the summer months with diluted
solutions of a houseplant fertilizer. Don't overdo it.
</P>
<P>
   Repot as needed as your plants grow. You don't want them to
become root-bound. Decrease watering fall to spring, letting the
soil dry between waterings. As your plants near flowering age,
you'll find these drier, sunnier conditions may promote blooms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My banana trees have bananas. When should I cut them?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let the fruit remain until the ridges on the bananas begin to
round off and there is a hint of yellow. Cut the entire stem with
the fruit. Ripen the fruit in a warm room indoors. A fruited trunk
will die, so you might as well remove it. You can hang the stem on
a large hook.
</P>
<P>
   The banana isn't a tree, but a herbaceous perennial that rises
from an underground corm. New plants that grow from these are
called suckers. When a sucker matures, it will produce fruit. The
plant needs about 400 warm days to accomplish that, and often we
have enough of a winter to freeze bananas to the ground. While we
do get new growth from the rootstocks, we can protect the trunks
during the winter and get fruit.
</P>
<P>
   To provide freeze protection, cut the trunk back to about 6 feet
shortly before the first freeze of the year is forecast. Wrap the
trunk securely with at least six layers of insulation. You can
alternate three layers of newspaper with three of burlap. Remove
the coverings after the last freeze in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   When a trunk is about to flower, you may see a leaf less than a
foot long that emerges from a flattened stem. This is known as a
``flag.'' Then the bracts will form. These are tightly closed and
resemble a big pink or maroon bud. After a few days, this flops
down. As the bracts begin to lift, you will see the fingers, or
fruits, with female flowers on their tips. There is no need to
pollinate.
</P>
<P>
   A trunk can produce several hands, or clusters, of the
fingerlike fruit. Eventually the trunk will begin producing male
flowers but no fruits. If pollen from the male fruit touches the
female flowers, the result is bananas with large seeds, so growers
usually remove male flowers. The fruit continues to develop, and
later, as described above, the entire stem with fruit is cut. A
stem with fruit can be heavy, so you may want help harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: &UR;  &LR; I have a staghorn fern that has outgrown the wood on which
it was mounted. I presently have it sitting in some sphagnum moss.
Could you advise me how to transplant this lovely plant and how to
propagate it as well?
</P>
<P>
   I have seen an odd ``ant.'' It is much larger than any ant I've
seen, not to mention it seems to be covered in reddish fur. Could
you identify this critter?
</P>
<P>
   A: Staghorns are epiphytes that grow on rocks or trees in their
native habitat. The ferns feature two types of fronds: the flat,
sterile shield fronds and the emerging, longer fertile fronds that
resemble a stag's horns. It is the flat shield fronds that cling to
the surface on which the fern grows.
</P>
<P>
   Many staghorns are clumping and have creeping, branching
rhizomes that are hidden behind the shields. As a staghorn grows,
new green shields are produced from the tips of the rhizomes. The
new shields fit snugly against the older shields. A shield turns
brown and papery with age, then eventually decays. A mass of
organic debris collects, and the shield becomes something of a
built-in compost system.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to divide and transplant is when the shield frond
has turned brown. Study the fern before dividing, and look for
natural divisions or offsets. You will cut it as you would a pie.
You can cut a larger fern into several or few pieces. But recovery
is quickest if you divide the plant into just a few, larger pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Use a clean, sharp knife to cut down into the brown shield and
sever a group of fronds that has developed at a tip of the
branching rhizome. Cut deeply enough to sever rhizome and roots.
Once you have made a division, cut any older fertile fronds on that
division in half. It's sometimes difficult to bring yourself to do
this, but don't be intimidated. Soak the divisions in Superthrive.
</P>
<P>
   Staghorns are grown in a coarse, well-draining potting mixture
or in moss-lined baskets, or you can attach the plantlets with
plastic-covered wire to a slab of tree-fern fiber, bark or wood. A
nest of damp sphagnum moss covering the roots will help maintain
moisture. Mist every day or two.
</P>
<P>
   I think what you might be seeing is the red velvet ant or cow
killer ant. This is actually a wasp and is about three-fourths of
an inch long. Wingless females are covered in dense hair. Males
have wings. The name cow killer comes from the painful sting. These
move about in summer, I'm told.

WOMAN WHO LOST INFANT CAMPAIGNS FOR `JAKE'S LAW'

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLD ORCHARD BEACH, Maine _ Jake Belisle was born on Dec. 10,
1997, in a hospital called Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   He died four months, 17 days, 16 hours, and 36 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby's skull was completely crushed in the back,'' said
Mike Sperry, a State Police lieutenant who was present when the
autopsy was performed on the tiny body.
</P>
<P>
   Jake's baby sitter has been charged with his death. And his
mother, Pamela Belisle, from her Old Orchard Beach mobile home has
begun a campaign that she hopes will save other babies.
</P>
<P>
   Belisle wants the state to pass what she calls ``Jake's Law,''
instituting mandatory minimum sentences for people convicted of
manslaughter in the death of young children. And she is leading an
effort to try to prevent child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some other baby's going to either live because of Jake,''
Belisle said the other day, seated at her kitchen table, ``or if
they do die, then their killers are going to get punished like they
deserve because of Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   Police say Jake, who had multiple head injuries, died of being
shaken. Virginia Stanley, Jake's baby sitter, has pleaded not
guilty. A trial date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Stanley told police that Jake
choked on his bottle and she jostled him as she tried to help.
</P>
<P>
   For Belisle, the campaign seems to be a balm for her sorrow. A
memorial fund has been established in her son's name, and Belisle
sends blue-and-yellow ``Don't Shake Jake'' bumper stickers to
doctor's offices and other agencies. She hands out phone stickers
with crisis line numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Tears spill from the 26-year-old's blue eyes as she talks about
her baby, the first for her and her husband David. She talks about
how he was starting to roll, how he would smile. About how she gave
him her old Pooh Bear from when she was a kid, and how he would see
it and say, ``Ooh!''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a happy little blue-eyed bug,'' Belisle said.
</P>
<P>
   When she wakes up in the night, she still listens for her baby.
</P>
<P>
   Belisle's cause got a boost in July when the Maine Sunday
Telegram published a story about prison time served in Maine by
people convicted of killing children. On average, child killers
convicted of manslaughter were sentenced to 12 years in jail, with
six years suspended, plus probation. But they ended up spending an
average of less than four years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   This was not news to police and prosecutors, but it was to the
public and to state legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of hits you between the eyes,'' said state Senator
John Benoit, a Rangeley Republican and former district court judge.
``At least it hit me between the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Peggy Pendleton, a Scarborough Democrat who knows
firsthand the grief of burying a child, is on Belisle's side.
``When the child dies and they're under 5, the person (who killed
them) is out of jail before that kid would even be in
kindergarten,'' said Pendleton, whose 19-year-old daughter died in
a car crash. ``That's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Both lawmakers plan to sponsor ``Jake's Law'' legislation.
</P>
<P>
   People accused of killing children in Maine and elsewhere are
often charged with manslaughter rather than murder, which is much
harder to prove in court. There are often no witnesses, and the
accused often have no criminal record. And juries, said Maine
Attorney General Andrew Ketterer, often balk at murder charges in
such cases.
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, murder carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 25
years. There is no such provision for manslaughter. Ironically,
Maine is tough on people who assault children. Assault is a
misdemeanor unless it is against a child under 6; then it is
automatically a felony, Ketterer said.
</P>
<P>
   According to many national organizations, no statistics exist to
compare the sentences meted out in Maine to child killers with
those given in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 279-day sentence given British au pair Louise
Woodward was criticized by some as too lenient, Massachusetts has
been somewhat tougher than Maine on people who kill babies. A Globe
review at the time of Woodward's sentencing found that of 22 child
homicides in Massachusetts between 1989 and 1997, the typical
sentence was 15 to 20 years. The average time served could not be
determined. Woodward, unlike many child killers, was initially
charged with first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's without question that children, by and large, are
second-class citizens when it comes to the sentencing of people who
murder them,'' said Daniel Armagh, director of the National Center
for the Prosecution of Child Abuse in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But David Finklehor, director of the Center for Research on
Crimes Against Children at the University of New Hampshire, said
mandatory sentences are not an effective deterrent in such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a third to a half of those cases those children are already
known to authorities to be in danger. These are not random
events,'' Finklehor said. ``So rather than using a very blunt and
ineffective instrument _ the fear of time in jail _ what we should
be doing is using the prevention techniques that we know about to
try to save the lives of children who are at high risk.''
</P>
<P>
   While statistics can be difficult to interpret because of
differences in reporting and prosecution among states, the National
Center for Health Statistics reports that from 1989 to 1995, 26
children 14 and under were victims of homicide in Maine. In
Massachusetts in the same period, 94 children of that age group
were homicide victims; New Hampshire saw 17 child homicides;
Vermont had six; Rhode Island, 19; and Connecticut, 66.
</P>
<P>
   Ketterer, Maine's attorney general, said he opposes minimum
mandatory sentences. But judges tend to follow sentencing
parameters set in previous cases, and change is needed, he said.
``It's one thing to lose a child, and it's another thing to be told
that this person is going to serve 16 months or 23 months,''
Ketterer said. ``You could do that (sentence) standing on one
foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Belisle, for one, will not rest until change is made.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will say, `That brave young mother from Old Orchard,'''
Belisle said. ``It's not that I'm strong, I'm just doing what I
need to do to survive. ... I want his memory to live.''

CELEBRITIES GIVE CAMPUSES THAT SOMETHING SPECIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only teacher training Alan Simpson ever received was from an
Army training manual in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the John F. Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University from hiring him as an instructor after the US
senator from Wyoming retired in January 1997. Or from elevating
Simpson to become director of the school's Institute of Politics
beginning this year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Brown University didn't flinch from giving Carlos
Fuentes, the acclaimed Latin American author, the title of
professor-at-large several years ago, even though Fuentes had not
worked his way through the academic ranks and even though he
conducts only one seminar a semester.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of raging debate over the training of America's
grade-school teachers, the country's colleges and universities are
recruiting more and more faculty whose primary claim to fame
derives from something other than their scholarly achievements. And
even some of those with solid pedagogical credentials are being
chosen, at least partly, because their celebrity can add prestige _
and certainly draw publicity _ to institutions that believe they
need every boost they can get in the increasingly competitive world
of higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that image has become very important,'' said Irving
Epstein, provost at Brandeis University. ``You have to get people's
attention quickly ... and if there's a name that people recognize,
they're more likely to look at all the other wonderful things the
school has to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly has been the case for schools such as Boston
University, which has steadily enhanced its national status, appeal
to students, and fund-raising over the years by raising its public
profile even as it raised its academic standards. One way it has
accomplished both goals was by enlisting professors such as authors
and Nobel laureates Elie Wiesel and Saul Bellow.
</P>
<P>
   This year's roster of high-profile hires at New England schools
contains many faces from the political world, including onetime
presidential adviser David Gergen and former US representative
Susan Molinari at the Kennedy School, and Robert Reich, former
secretary of labor, at Brandeis. It includes some people who might
just as soon have forgone their fame, such as Lani Guinier, who
moves this semester from the University of Pennsylvania to Harvard
Law School; and Anita Hill, who is on leave from the University of
Oklahoma Law School and will be a visiting scholar at Brandeis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with it as long as it does not get out
of hand ... and as long as they bring something,'' Wiesel, who
teaches a course each semester to about 50 students, said of the
trend toward celebrities on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``A university is judged by the quality of its teachers, but
even more by the quality of its students,'' he added. ``So if a
famous person is interesting to see, and so brings better students
to the school ... the contribution is a positive one.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School, echoing an observation
made by many of those interviewed, said students gravitate to the
classes of well-known instructors _ at least initially.
</P>
<P>
   ``They vote with their feet. ... They don't continue to show up
if they find a classroom empty of content,'' said Nye.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics acknowledge there's little evidence that US
colleges and universities are lowering their hiring standards as a
consequence of this quest for recognition. Indeed, almost by
definition, most schools with the clout or money to attract
celebrities also have reputations that they don't want to
jeopardize by appearing either to sap the strength of their
faculties or to compromise their academic priorities.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some academics question whether universities
and colleges are moving away from their traditional teaching roles,
particularly when they hire instructors whose primary value is in
relating their real-life experiences without a scholarly component.
Higher education, they caution, should not reach a point where it
becomes indistinguishable from job training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in the creative arts _ writing, painting ... and
so forth _ I think there's a strong case to be made for getting
practitioners who have a strong interest in teaching and have a
great deal to provide and are respected by their peers,'' said
Newell Stultz, associate dean of the faculty at Brown. ``I'm
agnostic on this, but the critics do say that, whatever the value,
celebrity is not what we do, and it shouldn't undermine the
integrity of our offerings. Students should be directed to
understand that politics and political science are not the same
thing; we don't want to lose that distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other risks as well.
</P>
<P>
   Many college professors are notable for their egos, and
introducing prominent outsiders into their ranks, particularly if
they are very well paid or have less-than-impressive academic
backgrounds, can cause friction. Rivalries and resentments already
are growing within universities because many schools are paying
hundreds of thousands of dollars in salaries to lure away each
other's scholastic stars, and the celebrity issue adds fuel to the
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the marquee names, whether or not they achieved their
status for their academic work, also draw the ire of their
colleagues because they are given light course loads and don't have
to conduct research, publish, or do some of the other work that is
part of a regular professor's duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit like having an independent production deal
at a movie company,'' said Robert Parker, who wrote his first
Spenser detective novels while teaching at Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Former senator Simpson acknowledged that nonacademics have a
``considerable learning curve,'' but he was among many who argued
that students benefit from a mix of hands-on and ivory-tower
perspectives. He acknowledged, though, that the two worlds have
inherent differences.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson recalled attending a faculty meeting last year at which
he observed the contrast between political and university
professionals: ``They look at us as mystery people and we look at
them as mystery people. They think of us as folks who make
monumental decisions based on 30-second briefings in elevators, and
we think of them as the ones who send us five pounds of books and
say, `Here's how you solve the world's problems.' There's a good
deal of creative tension ... but, over time, there's also a great
deal of respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson and two other office-holders-turned-teachers, Michael
Dukakis and Ann Richards, said in separate interviews that longtime
professors _ particularly those who assume that celebrities get an
easy ride _ sometimes don't appreciate how hard outsiders work to
compensate for their lack of experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it, but I will never, ever do it again,'' said
Richards, a former governor of Texas who guest-taught a class in
government at Brandeis last year. ``My expectations of myself were
too high ... and I hated the emotional investment of being truly
worried whether I would be good enough. ... You would have thought
I was trying for a Pulitzer with every lecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Dukakis, who splits his time between Northeastern and the
University of California in Los Angeles, agreed about the pressure.
He said that students initially feel it too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for who I am ... or whoever the celebrity might
be ... they certainly would feel less intimidated, and that's
something many other professors don't have to contend with,'' he
said. ``But it goes away on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Few professorial excursions have received as much attention in
recent years as did filmmaker Spike Lee's at Harvard in 1992. He
was invited by Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the Afro-American
Studies Department and a star professor in his own right, to be a
visiting lecturer on contemporary black cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics at Harvard and elsewhere privately questioned Lee's
qualifications to teach, even temporarily, at a such an illustrious
institution. But he apparently got positive reviews from students,
and his credentials in his field appeared as strong as those many
politicians bring into the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems to be a consensus that the most desirable and
least controversial celebrities are those who have done serious
work within academia _ before, after, or during the activities that
thrust their names into the spotlight. Meanwhile, there seems to be
agreement that a smattering of stars may not only be acceptable,
but even beneficial, under the right conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK as long as academic standards aren't compromised and
the people who are coming to campus genuinely add value by creating
more intellectual excitement,'' said Reich, who was a professor at
Harvard for a decade before becoming President Clinton's first
labor secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would worry, frankly, if there was competitive bidding
merely for notoriety or celebrity,'' he added. ``But I don't think
colleges and universities have gotten to the point where they are
neglecting their essential mission in pursuit of notoriety. That,
ultimately, would be to their detriment.''

ALL-BOOKS WEEKEND SET FOR C-SPAN 2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Readers who enjoy immersing themselves in the world of books
will soon be able to do so by ... turning on their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Sept. 12, C-SPAN 2 will devote its entire weekend of
programming to books, books, and more books. The 48 hours of
bibliomania will be dubbed ``Book TV.'' It is believed to be the
largest bloc of book programming ever on television.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN chairman Brian Lamb said Monday that the decision to
switch to all-books programming on weekends grew out of the
popularity of ``Booknotes,'' an author-interview program he hosts,
and ``About Books,'' a show featuring readings by authors.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with TV critics, Lamb described ``Book TV'' as
``a network within a network.'' C-SPAN 2 currently airs
gavel-to-gavel coverage of the US Senate during the week and mostly
repeats on the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Authors and readers of fiction may be disappointed in Book TV,
since C-SPAN executives say its primary focus will be nonfiction:
history, biography, tomes on politics and public policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective in this ... is to connect the written word with
the person watching our television network that is devoted to
public affairs,'' said Lamb. ``If out that come (increased book)
sales, terrific. But that's not our main objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why fiction will get short shrift, Lamb replied: ``This is
a nonfiction network, dealing with public policy and politics,''
adding that with 67,000 books published last year alone, ``We had
to draw the line somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Book TV is launched, it will begin at 8 a.m. Saturdays and
run until 8 a.m. Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   It will feature authors and editors discussing their books,
tours of bookstores and libraries, an ``inside look'' at the
publishing and bookselling indstries, and call-in shows to discuss
the world of books. There will also be segments on children's books
and on book clubs.
</P>
<P>
   C-SPAN and C-SPAN 2 are now closely identified with coverage of
congressional hearings in Washington, but Book TV will enable the
cable network to move well beyond the Beltway. C-SPAN executives
acknowledged Monday that they hope Book TV will prompt more cable
operators to carry C-SPAN 2.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for a network whose schedule is hard to predict
because it is driven by political events, Book TV could be a
fruitful foray into the realm of ``appointment viewing,'' a
television term for regularly-scheduled shows that viewers make an
``appointment'' to watch.

FIRMS SEEK HELP TO FILL CROSS-CULTURAL GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If, in 1994, someone had told officials at ETEC Systems Inc.
that one of their engineers would be asked to leave a Japanese
firm, they probably would not have believed it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the engineer in question was a top employee who had
everything the California-based computer equipment manufacturer
wanted in a worker. He was aggressive, creative, bold _ a go-getter
by American standards. On top of that, ETEC's product, a machine
that generates master patterns for producing semiconductor chips,
was a hot commodity and in demand.
</P>
<P>
   But one week after the field engineer arrived at a Japanese
company to install the machine, his hosts booted him out. They also
warned ETEC that he would not be invited back.
</P>
<P>
   ``His problems started the minute he got off the plane and his
hosts met him at the airport, handed him their business cards, and
he stuffed them into his hip pocket,'' recalled Mitzi
Garnett-Sullivan, manager of quality programs at ETEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``To him a business card was a reference number to be used in
the event he needed to call you,'' said Garnett-Sullivan. ``To the
Japanese, business cards are a way to get to know the person behind
the card. You never put the card in your hip pocket. To them, that
was an insult.''
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't all. The engineer's brashness was seen as
rudeness. His questions were considered intrusive, and his advice
to the chief executive was seen as disrespectful. Then, there was
his nonconformist adherence to a strict set of break times (he ate
lunch at noon and had dinner each night at 6). In Japan, by
contrast, employees do not eat lunch until all morning work is
done, and then everyone leaves together.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about cultural dissonance.
</P>
<P>
   With so many executives involved in international business
deals, US employers and their employees are finding that there is
more to global trade than they ever imagined, and much of it has to
do with understanding the host country's language, mores and
customs.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies are turning to intercultural specialists for
help. Like the diversity consultants of the 1980s whose workshops
and retreats promised to help US firms better understand class,
gender, sex, and racial diversity in the workplace, these new
intercultural gurus are tapping into the ever-expanding global
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Take Lewis Griggs, founder of Griggs Productions Inc., which
specializes in preventing disharmony. Griggs got his start 15 years
ago, when Random House published his book, ``Going International,''
a primer for business travelers that is still in print. ``I decided
to get involved in this work after finding out that I was the
problem,'' noted Griggs, whose firm is based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the Ugly American, even though I was well educated. I
really believed that Americans were the only ones who did things
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Griggs changed his mind shortly after a group of Japanese
businessmen paid a visit to the genetics engineering firm he worked
for and Griggs' attempts to capture their business failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had learned English, they had studied something about my
culture, but I knew nothing about them,'' he recalled. ``They were
bilingual and spoke in Japanese to each other occasionally, but I
couldn't understand what was going on. I suddenly realized what it
meant to be an outsider. I also realized that I did not hold the
power (in that meeting), they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Griggs specializes in the business and social customs of
Japan, China, England, and South Africa. His fees range from $1,500
per day to $5,000 per hour, depending on the amount of training
required.
</P>
<P>
   California-based ETEC solved its problem by hiring Charis
Intercultural Training Corp. in Pleasanton, Calif. Charis means
goodwill in Greek.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the semiconductor equipment manufacturer requires
extensive training of all overseas staff. It also has instituted a
program for domestic employees called Passport Days. The goal: to
familiarize ETEC workers with the customs, traditions, foods, and
habits of the foreign business representatives who journey to the
company each year to learn how to operate and maintain its $20
million machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Consultant Marian Stetson-Rodriguez, founder and owner of Charis
Intercultural, helped design Passport Days and was in charge of
developing ETEC's training program for foreign executives.
</P>
<P>
   What do consultants teach? ``Basically, we try to teach them
that if they go to Korea, they really need to know the difference
between that country and Japan,'' said Stetson-Rodriguez. ``If they
go to Europe, they should understand that France and Germany both
share the same currency now, but Britain does not.''
</P>
<P>
   Intercultural consultants can also point out subtle differences
that can make or break a business deal. For example:
</P>
<P>
   _In many countries, direct eye contact is considered rude,
controlling, invasive, and dominating. ``This is especially true in
Asian countries and partially true in most African and Middle
Eastern countries,'' said Griggs.

GRIER'S STRATEGY: YOUNGER, STRONGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ As Bobby Grier was looking at the waiver
wire Monday, he was looking for youth, not experience, to add to
the Patriots. Former Patriots assistant coach Jim Ringo once told
him, ``Anytime you play a rookie, it's one more game you'll lose,''
but Grier realized this wasn't true after coaching a young Tony
Collins in 1981 when he gained 873 yards and averaged 4.3 yards per
carry. Since then, Grier has realized that youth is the only way to
go.
</P>
<P>
   So it's not surprising that a survey of the New England roster
finds 16 players in their first or second year.
</P>
<P>
   After the late Dick Steinberg reprimanded him for playing an
older fullback over a younger one with more ability, Grier said he
learned that ``if you want to do this right and sustain it for a
longer period of time, you have to get (younger players) coached
and get them on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be a stop-the-presses idea, but there are more
veteran-heavy teams who are less successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is we're going to draft young players and we
want our coaches to coach the dickens out of them,'' said Grier,
the Patriots' vice president of player personnel. ``With the salary
cap and free agency, the game is a little bit different than what
it was. It's almost to the point now it's reversed, where every
rookie you don't play it'll cost you. You've only got these guys
for three or four years and then they're gone. So if you can
develop these young guys and have them for three or four years and
sign them up, you're ahead of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier's philosophy is to keep only the veterans who really get
it and are necessary to the success of the team. The others can be
traded. That's what Grier did with defensive lineman Mike Jones,
sending him to the Rams. Second-year tackle Brandon Mitchell had
come on in leaps and bounds. Rookie Greg Spires has been a big
find. So Jones was expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Grier was criticized last year for making Chris Canty a
first-round pick, but suddenly the light has clicked in Canty's
head. He's still short and bigger receivers will hurt him, but
Canty can be better than Jimmy Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing the way we thought he could play,'' said Grier.
``The interesting thing about him is that Chris was 16 when he
graduated from high school. He was very young and his former
defensive coordinator (Bobby Stoops), who is now defensive
coordinator at the University of Florida, told us that Chris had
the ability to start as a freshman at Kansas State but he didn't
put it all together until his second year.
</P>
<P>
   ``His comment to us was if you can get through his first year _
and it will be tough _ then you'll have a good football player when
he matures and figures it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think he has a lot of ability. It's a matter of focusing in
and so far he's been able to concentrate and pay attention to
smaller details. As a result, his teammates have confidence in him.
The way he played last year I don't think there was a lot of
confidence in him by teammates. He's winning his teammates over and
this has really helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   But with bigger receivers coming into the league, Grier thought
he needed a bigger cornerback. Thus, Tebucky Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we wanted to address is Miami, who had Yatil Green,
though he got hurt,'' said Grier. ``You have the big guy sitting
there in New York (Keyshawn Johnson). So we wanted a big, physical
corner who could play those guys. We felt and we still feel Tebucky
has that ability to play as a big corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier also took heat for letting Sam Gash go, and replacing him
with 26-year-old Tony Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Tony was a good fullback, but we didn't know what an
animal he is on special teams,'' said Grier.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Grier hates to get rid of draft picks. He selected
Tony Gaiter in the sixth round a year ago and waited for him to
develop on the practice squad, but he didn't and was cut. Grier
also waived fourth-rounder Leonta Rheams, a defensive tackle from
the University of Houston. ``He needs some upper-body
development,'' said Grier. Yet he kept seventh-rounder Jason
Andersen, a 6-foot-7-inch, 320-pound center/long-snapper, giving
the Patriots 10 offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   He said the draft this year yielded players who can step in and
play right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've probably answered the questions we went into
camp with,'' said Grier. ``I think the thing that has been good is
the development of the young guys who we felt could come in here
and have a job as opposed to the guys we drafted a year ago. We
knew we needed a blocking tight end and that this kid (Rod
Rutledge) was going to play. He's proven to be a very solid blocker
at tight end. We knew we were going to draft a fullback who needed
to contribute and play, and Chris Floyd has done that. We knew
Robert Edwards was going to contribute and play and we knew Tebucky
was going to contribute and play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy we really liked _ but there was some doubt about _ and
that we thought was a lot like Tedy Bruschi, was Greg Spires. The
guy just makes plays and is a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier's sleeper is Harold Shaw. As a former running backs coach,
Grier considers Shaw a player with ``special skills' and someone
who can ``help us in November and December'' with his
straight-ahead style.
</P>
<P>
   He feels the same way about Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Edwards is a very good running back,'' said Grier. ``I
don't think we've seen what Robert can really do. We need to get
him healthy and get him into the game and get him going. He has a
lot of versatility. When we watched him at Georgia, he actually
lined up as a wide receiver. They would split him out. When you
split out running backs, you usually put them out there to put them
out there _ you're not going to do things with them. He ran
excellent pass routes. The thing that surprised us was his blocking
ability. I don't think you've seen the best of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Grier believes the '98 Patriots are deeper than last year. He
hopes the players who had off years in '97 (Terry Glenn, Willie
McGinest) come back strong and stay healthy. If they do and his
young players come alive, Grier may be able to break into a smile
and begin to enjoy this.

   TAKE-BOS  
 MARAZION, England: ... diminish it.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The drive from Land's End back down the north coast of the
Penwith Peninsula is considered one of the most scenic in England.
The coast road runs beside steep cliffs and across a timeless
Celtic landscape of boulder-strewn moorland and isolated farmsteads
with fields that are brilliantly green in the reflected sunlight
and bordered by lichen-speckled stone walls.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape here appears not to have changed much in modern
memory. Neither have places like St. Just, an old tin-mining town
still centered around the grassy amphitheater where miracle plays
were performed in the Middle Ages. Tin ore is found in only a few
places in Europe, and mining it was for centuries the basis of
Cornwall's prosperity, but only a few working mines remain. The
Wayside Museum in the nearby village of Zennor exhibits antique
tin-mining tools and equipment as well as a collection of Stone Age
knives, axes, and other artifacts found in the immediate vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cornwall isn't England, it's bare and elemental,'' wrote
novelist D.H. Lawrence. ``It is a most beautiful place.'' Lawrence
and his German wife, Frieda, lived in Zennor for 18 months during
World War I. Lawrence wrote ``Women in Love'' in a clifftop cottage
still standing on the outskirts of the village.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Frieda's maiden name was Von Richthoven, and she
was a cousin of the German flying ace Manfred Von Richthoven, ``The
Red Baron.'' Falsely accused by neighbors of signaling to German
submarines from the windows of their cottage, the couple was
ordered by the police to leave Cornwall and move inland.
</P>
<P>
   Zennor's snug and atmospheric pub, The Tinner's Arms, is one of
the oldest in Cornwall. It's a good place to stop for a pint of
Cornwall's own St. Austell ale and a Cornish pasty. Supposedly
invented by tin miners so they could carry a hearty lunch in their
pockets, the pasty is a kind of turnover stuffed with meat,
potatoes, and onions _ and very filling.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval parish church of Zennor is dedicated to St. Senara,
who, like most Cornish saints, is unknown outside Cornwall. There
is a legend, depicted in a carving in the church, about a mermaid
who fell in love with a handsome local fisherman. To win his love,
so the legend goes, she came to the church one Sunday and sang so
sweetly in the choir that the young man happily followed her back
beneath the waves.
</P>
<P>
   A path leads from beside the church to Zennor Head, one of the
most spectacularly scenic spots along the 268-mile-long coastal
footpath that encircles Cornwall. The stretch of coast between
Zennor and St. Ives at the eastern end of the peninsula fits
Lawrence's description perfectly: bare, elemental, and beautiful.
The Stone Age is a real presence here, and Neolithic circles,
burial cairns, and standing stones are more numerous than anywhere
else in Cornwall.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornish equivalent of Provincetown, St. Ives has been
attracting artists since 1811. That's when the great landscape
painter J.M.W. Turner, drawn by the luminous light and the mild
weather that make this stretch of coast ``The English Riviera,''
first set up his easel. Other artists (including James McNeill
Whistler) followed, and many tourists have come since. However,
St.Ives is still as much working fishing port as artist colony and
tourist resort, and a pleasant, characterful town to wander around
in.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, London's Tate Gallery opened a satellite gallery
on the beachfront as a showcase for modern art, particularly the
British avant garde school associated with St. Ives. A gleaming
white building built around a glass-fronted rotunda looking out on
the harbor, the Tate Gallery is itself an artistic statement.
</P>
<P>
   The artist most closely identified with St. Ives in modern times
is a sculptor, the late Barbara Hepworth, who drew inspiration from
what she described as: ``The remarkable pagan landscape which lies
between St. Ives, Penzance and Land's End.'' Now open to the
public, her studio includes a high-walled garden that is a lush
oasis in the busy town. The sculpture garden is filled with
brilliantly executed bronze and stone abstract pieces by Hepworth,
all inspired by the ancient, haunting menhirs and ceremonial stones
of the Penwith Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU GO &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the favorite destinations of British vacationers,
Cornwall is easily reached from London by train or car. Trains run
from London to Penzanze and St. Ives, the two most popular seaside
resorts. The trip takes about five hours. A highspeed motorway, the
A30, runs through the heart of Cornwall to Penzance. The A30
connects with the A394 which leads directly to Land's End, the
windy headland that is the southernmost tip of Britain. Well
maintained secondary roads follow the curving coastline all around
the Penwith Peninsula. The peninsula is also circled by a scenic
footpath.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to see something of Britain's West Country but had
limited time to spend in Cornwall. So, I compromised and took the
train as far as Exeter in Devon, a two hour trip.
</P>
<P>
   In Exeter, an old cathedral town worth lingering in, I picked up
a rental car. I had arranged for a car through Auto Europe
(800-223-5555) a Portland, Maine-based budget car rental company
with agents all over Great Britain. In this case, the Auto Europe
agency was conveniently located in an office park just off the A30.
</P>
<P>
   Although it skirts the coastline, the A30 offers good views of
the Cornish countryside and crosses Bodmincq Moor, a former haunt
of smugglers and highwaymen that was the background for the
romantic novel ``Jamaica Inn'' by Daphne ducq Maurier. The book is
fiction but the inn, an authentic old highwaymen's haunt, is real
and signposted from the motorway.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ The once eerie resemblance is nearly gone
now, a victim of sharply divergent lifestyles that have, in a
terrible irony, left the identical twins with faces more foreign
than familiar.
</P>
<P>
   But look long and deeply enough into the hazel eyes of Conrad
and Perry McKinney, and there is an enduring and undeniable link
that has held firm despite years of desperation and grief,
homelessness and fear, alcoholism and despair. And, now, a fear
that their immutable bond will be severed by death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're twins,'' says Conrad, a fit-and-trim private detective
from Peabody, Mass. ``We've always been there for each other. And I
just don't want to see him die young.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is overtaking my life,'' says Perry, who
sleeps amid trash under a bridge near the Piscataqua River here.
``I am very content. I'm very happy. I just have to have a drink
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The McKinney brothers, born three minutes apart 56 years ago,
say their story is one of parallel lives gradually deflected by
drink. And, depending on which brother is narrating the tale, it's
the account of wasted talent and the consequences of disdain, or
the freedom to choose even if that choice means supper in soup
kitchens and nightly bouts with a bottle of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bizarre how Conrad is as straight as an arrow. He
doesn't drink. He doesn't do drugs. And Perry went the completely
other way,'' says Lee Snodgrass, an Andover, Mass., businessman who
grew up with the McKinneys. ``One's living in a nice house in
Peabody and the other one is sleeping in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wild. It's just wild.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perry and Conrad McKinney were born Jan. 21, 1942, the first
children of an alcoholic mother and an enterprising father. And,
befitting a family distantly related to the blue-blooded Lowells of
Boston, they were raised in a large and handsome 21-room home in
Derry, N.H., where servants made the beds and cooked the meals.
</P>
<P>
   Perry was the elder and, Conrad always held, the smarter of the
identical twins, who were occasionally baby-sat by the sister of
Alan Shepard, their Derry neighbor who later was to become the
first American rocketed into space.
</P>
<P>
   In the days when pagers and cell phones were the stuff of
science fiction, the boys' father, Frank L. McKinney, moved the
family to grittier Portsmouth, where he ran a telephone answering
service firm. It took messages that tethered customers to doctors
and lawyers and taxicab drivers in a 16-town region in southern New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The boys wore each other's clothes and ran in the same circles.
Both were altar boys at Christ Church in Portsmouth. They sat in
the same classroom at Whipple School here, where they gained a
reputation as average students with a penchant for trouble-making.
</P>
<P>
   In a post-World War II era when the Portsmouth waterfront was a
teeming nexus of sailors and shipbuilders who crowded darkened
barrooms patrolled by military police, the boys would shine shoes
for the beefy, beer-drinking men.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother would be in the bars a lot, anyway,'' Perry says.
``I didn't know what an alcoholic was in those days. I just knew
she was drinking all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   When their schoolhouse roughhousing grew intolerable for their
grammar school teachers, the boys were separated after the fifth
grade. Perry was kept back and began to accumulate a circle of
friends who were rowdier and more risk-taking than his younger
twin's.
</P>
<P>
   The boys made the local papers for the first time as teenagers
when Perry drove his car into one with his brother sitting at the
wheel. The hometown headline about colliding twins was meant as a
cute feature. It was, nevertheless, portentous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I look back on it, I think we started going our different
ways in high school and over drinking,'' Conrad says. ``There were
nights that he'd stay out all night drinking and I'd say, `How can
you do that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fed up by studies and with little patience for by-the-book
conduct, both brothers quit Portsmouth High School _ Conrad after
the 10th grade, Perry after the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to join the Army and see the world. But after the
twins and a group of buddies traveled to Manchester to meet a
recruiter, only Perry took the oath of allegiance. The others, in
separate rooms, opted instead for the Army Reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find out I'm the only one who got in,'' Perry recalls. ``I
said to them, `Hey, there's something wrong with this buddy
system.'''
</P>
<P>
   Quickly disenchanted with Army regimen and the prospect of
stocking supply shelves in Arizona, Perry says he finagled an
honorable discharge after a ``medical problem'' and, within a year
or so, the brothers found themselves back at Portsmouth High.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hung out together all the time back then,'' says Snodgrass,
who now runs an asbestos abatement company. ``We worked on cars,
mostly '51 and '53 Fords. We'd jump in the car and drive to New
York City for the hell of it. The normal things that kids do.
Conrad didn't drink and neither did I. We were typically the
drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perry says his stint with the military soured him on convention,
and what happened when he returned to school left him even more
riled. He was elected to the student council. In the 11th grade and
immensely popular, he ran for class president. Hallway chatter
suggested a McKinney landslide until a public-address announcement
on Election Day summoned him to the principal's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go down there and they tell me _ what a coincidence _ that
it's a tie,'' Perry says. ``I knew I had won because I knew so many
kids in the class. But they gave it to a kid who lived in the good
end of town, was well off, and was a golfer. That's when I quit for
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry already had a reputation among his contemporaries as a
wheeler-dealer. Like his brother, he had dabbled in real estate for
years, buying run-down apartment buildings for a song, fixing them
up, and renting them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The McKinney boys were driving better cars than the
teachers,'' recalls Jim MacKenzie, a local grocer who grew up with
the twins. ``They were driving Lincolns. They had these apartment
houses. Perry always had new cars and plenty of money. He's got the
capacity to be a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   With school now a memory, Perry embarked on a real-life game of
Monopoly. He ultimately acquired 14 properties in New Hampshire and
Maine _ land later squandered by the vagaries of the real estate
market and his appetite for alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've won and lost. I've been on Boardwalk and I've gone to
jail,'' Perry says.
</P>
<P>
   He married a woman he had met in junior high school and they
quickly had four sons. He sold aluminum siding door to door. He ran
a successful fruit and vegetable stand, whose stock he purchased at
dawn in Boston and gleefully sold as ``native'' hours later to
Massachusetts tourists in New Hampshire. He manufactured homemade
bottles of detergent for 7 cents each and sold them for 99 cents,
profits that financed a colorful trip to the West Coast and back.

   Here are five lessons, one for each Spice (past and present):
</P>
<P>
   _ They take themselves just seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
   Many entertainers, and workers in general, have lost all sense
of perspective when it comes to their jobs. Chances are the Spice
Girls will be a distant memory in 20 years, and they don't kid
themselves into thinking that they're curing AIDS or ending world
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many workers _ including some entertainers _ the
Spice Girls don't look like they're just going through the motions.
It's obvious from all accounts that they seem to love what they're
doing, and that makes it fun for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   _ Each worker is a brand name.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the preachings of Peters, the workplace guru who
wrote ``In Search of Excellence'' and many other books. Even if
you're a rank-and-filer, you need to be talented enough or have
special skills that will make you stand out from your peers. That
makes you less likely to be laid off and more likely to be
attractive to other employers if you want a change.
</P>
<P>
   The Spice Girls have managed that. Even if you have never been
to a concert, never bought a CD and never listened to a song in its
entirety, you might still know their names are Scary, Sporty, Posh
and Baby (not to be confused with Having a Baby or Also Having a
Baby).
</P>
<P>
   As a baby boomer, I grew up listening to groups like the Rolling
Stones. But if my life depended on being able to name either the
four Spice Girls or four current Stones, I'd choose the Spice
Girls.
</P>
<P>
   You have no idea how much that scares me.
</P>
<P>
   _ They know how to handle a downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   The Spice Girls' most visible member, Ginger, left to pursue
other interests. If that happened at a lot of companies, the
remaining people would downplay Ginger's importance or bad-mouth
her or pretend she never existed.
</P>
<P>
   But at a recent concert in San Francisco, Ginger's image was on
the screen during some songs. However they feel about her, the
remaining four are smart enough to realize that a lot of their fans
still like Ginger.
</P>
<P>
   They also were able to fill in when she left. A lot of
businesses sputter when key people leave because they haven't taken
the time to prepare anyone else to handle the job.
</P>
<P>
   _ They understand their clients.
</P>
<P>
   Many businesses claim to understand what customers want, but
they miss out on the nuances.
</P>
<P>
   The Spice Girls are all about ``Girl Power,'' encouraging
self-esteem for a lot of girls who are at a vulnerable age. Most
businesses get that far: They identify a target audience and have a
slogan to lure them in.
</P>
<P>
   But a friend who took her niece to a concert told me the Girls
also made it a point to dedicate songs to parents, and even
acknowledge that some young boys are among their fans. And, in the
course of the concert, they rotated positions so that any fans near
the stage would at some point get a close-up glimpse of whatever
Girl was their favorite.
</P>
<P>
   After all, they're all brand names.
</P>
<P>
   _ They expand their skills.
</P>
<P>
   There has already been one Spice Girls movie, no doubt with
others on the horizon, and they have certainly shown a talent for
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of expanding, God knows the group could fall apart
tomorrow, thanks to the rumored pregnancies of Posh and Scary. But
don't bet on it. If their track record is any indication, the Spice
Girls will come up with one heck of a maternity policy.

 PORTSMOUTH, N.H.: ... and back.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If he was ever asked to produce a diploma, he'd present
Conrad's.
</P>
<P>
   Always there was the drinking. And when his wife, Sherry, died
suddenly from an aneurysm at age 29, things worsened. ``That was
the turning point,'' says MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   With his mother, who eventually married five times, in ``a
drying-out place,'' he took over his father's answering-service
business and gradually rode it into the ground. But he provided for
his children, making sure they were healthy and safe, clean and
clothed, educated and well-read until his youngest turned 18.
</P>
<P>
   And then he let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I had done my part. Now, if I can get up in the
morning and see the sun coming up, I say, `Geez. This is great,'''
Perry says. ``A lot of times I wonder where I am. There are a lot
of houses I sometimes stay at and I'll sit there and I'll hear
noises and I won't move. Where am I? I know I'm not in jail. This
time I'm not in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up. I'm so happy to be alive. I read the papers and see
all the bad things that are in the paper. There are a lot of
depressed people. I don't enjoy talking to negative people because
they make you think negative. I'm not a negative person. I have a
positive attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While Perry wandered, Conrad put down roots.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, at age 21, he graduated from Portsmouth High School and
began taking extension courses at the University of New Hampshire.
Two years later, he married his high school sweetheart and settled
here until his new wife and his bedeviled mother repeatedly
clashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife wasn't used to people fighting and arguing all the
time,'' Conrad says. ``So we left.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his brother, he accumulated real estate holdings that
brought wealth or debt, depending on the cycles of a fickle market.
But unlike Perry, Conrad pursued an interest in law enforcement
that would lead to stability and a career as a $100-an-hour private
detective.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he lives in a tastefully decorated split-level home in
Peabody. There's a built-in swimming pool out back; hardwood
floors, a sharp kitchen and a bright living room upstairs.
Downstairs there's a home office where he keeps the tools of his
trade: long-lens cameras, recording devices, binoculars,
walkie-talkies, and myriad disguises. He is a member of the board
of directors of the state's Licensed Private Detectives
Association.
</P>
<P>
   With a staccato delivery and a knack for self-promotion, Conrad
eagerly _ with details off the record _ discusses his surveillance
skills, the adrenaline rush of undercover work, the people he has
found, the scams he has busted.
</P>
<P>
   When he was featured in a North Shore newspaper story recently,
he posed in the guise of a biker dressed in a camouflaged jacket, a
leather cap, a wig, and fake moustache.
</P>
<P>
   When Princess Diana died a year ago, he told North Shore Sunday,
the pull was so great, he jumped on a plane to Paris to view the
crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the brothers _ best men in each other's weddings
_ kept in regular touch, for a while through a mutual interest in
the martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Conrad says, Perry's increasingly dangerous
addiction went undetected by a man who makes a living uncovering
people's darker sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we met, it would be in a bar. He was always
drinking. But I never put two and two together,'' Conrad says. ``I
would wonder why when we went out to eat, he would never eat. I'm a
detective and I didn't see it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Conrad did not need gumshoe credentials to detect when his
brother had hit rock bottom six years ago. The news was delivered
directly to his doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from someone who told me Perry was living on the
street,'' Conrad says. ``I went up to Portsmouth and tried to find
him. I knew where to go. I told him, `Perry, don't you understand
that why you're doing this is because of the drinking? Can't you
figure that out? I mean, just get rid of the drink.' But he said he
was fine, that he was happy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Perry was unable to meet the only precondition his brother
set in his offer to take him into his home to live in a basement
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'd do anything for him if he stops drinking,'' says
Conrad. ``Anyone would do anything for him if he'd stop.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a breezy and warm late-summer day and the sun is glinting
off the water that forms the border between New Hampshire and
Maine. Conrad McKinney's binoculars scan a waterfront framed by
fishing boats and _ in the distance _ the cranes of the Portsmouth
Naval Shipyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, he'd sleep under that bridge,'' Conrad says,
gesturing to a grimy ledge near the city's commercial fishing pier.
But Perry isn't there. It's noon and if his schedule has held, he's
had beers for breakfast, taken a 3-mile walk, gone to the library
to read the newspapers, and had lunch at an Alcoholics Anonymous
meeting he attends because, he says, he likes the stories.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad checks the bushes in a nearby park. Nothing. He stops a
maintenance worker who directs him to a shaded spot in a picnic
area. And there, reclining but awake, is his identical twin.
</P>
<P>
   ``There you are,'' Conrad says, warmly greeting his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the brothers and a reporter are sitting on the
deck of a floating restaurant _ a luncheon engagement Conrad tries
to keep every two weeks or so.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, his hair closely cropped and his jeans stylishly faded
and pressed, orders iced tea for everyone. When he excuses himself
for a visit to the men's room, Perry, wearing dirty dungarees and
the white mane of the homeless, politely asks the waitress for a
gin and tonic.
</P>
<P>
   He's homeless by choice, he insists. He wants no pity. He's got
plenty of friends and a closetful of belongings at the home of one
of his sons. He maintains close ties with his four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can take off right now and get dressed up and have a suit
and go out and do lots of work and make a good amount of money,''
says Perry, who has a single tooth left in his mouth. ``But you
know what? I'd be back the next day or the next week in the same
place as I am now because I'm so content here. I drink to relax. It
relaxes me. I'm very high-tempered. And drinking makes me calm
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad says he is convinced that Perry's death is imminent. If
publicity about his plight doesn't scare him straight, Conrad
reasoned, maybe Perry's story can help others.
</P>
<P>
   As a second gin and tonic arrives and Perry slowly sips a cup of
clam chowder, the brothers stare into each other's eyes and evenly
engage in this urgent exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad: ``What do you think people will think when they read all
this about us?''
</P>
<P>
   Perry: ``I don't have a problem with that. I figure you're doing
your thing. I'm doing my thing. I enjoy what I'm doing. Like I
said, I like the outdoors. I don't answer to anyone except God. And
I haven't met Him yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad: ``Well, what advice would you give me being your twin?
</P>
<P>
   Perry: ``Make sure you give me $20 before you leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad: ``You know what advice I would give you?''
</P>
<P>
   Perry: ``Quit drinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad: ``Yes. You can change. You can change. Do you think some
day that you'll stop drinking?''
</P>
<P>
   Perry: ``No.''

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 FALL RIVER, Mass.: ... was fraying.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After graduating from Catholic Memorial High School and Boston
University, Donnelly was a gym teacher at the Trotter School in
Roxbury who had become uneasy about rising crime and the spread of
drugs in his neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, young people in Dorchester began attending
crime-watch meetings and looking toward politics as a way to
reinforce their quality of life. In 1972, Donnelly added his name
to a state representative race whose 23 candidates ``looked like
they came from a Dublin phone book,'' one observer said.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly was largely unknown, but he had developed a loyal
following of young people, many of whom he knew through frequent
workouts at the Dorchester YMCA. The campaign was door-to-door,
trudging up and down sweltering triple-deckers and occasionally
yelling from the sidewalk to introduce himself to wary tenants
leaning out of third-floor windows.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly captured the last of three state House seats from
Dorchester's wards 16 and 17. In three terms on Beacon Hill, he
rose to assistant majority leader and set his sights in 1978 on the
congressional seat held by James A. Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian just went around methodically organizing his campaign,
and the wiseguys sat around waiting for the field to shake out,''
said Ed Forry, a longtime friend of Donnelly's who owns the
Dorchester Reporter and Boston Irish Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The thinking, Forry said, was that Donnelly ``is just an
ordinary guy. He might be a good guy, but he's just an ordinary
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling that perception, Forry said, was the fact that _ then
and now _ ``Brian doesn't promote himself. He doesn't do the things
that you don't like about politicians, but that they have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, with a late endorsement from Burke and backing from
state Senator Joseph Timilty, Donnelly won the seat handily. The
1978 race was the last tough campaign that Donnelly has had to
wage.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Donnelly represented the 11th District, heavily
Irish territory that stretched from the familiar turf of Dorchester
south to Quincy and Weymouth, and on to Brockton. Thomas P. (Tip)
O'Neill Jr. was House speaker then, and Donnelly communicated
easily with the quintessential Irish-American politician.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly was appointed to the Budget Committee in his second
term, served on the Public Works Committee, and was given a seat on
the pivotal Ways and Means Committee in 1985. There, he closely
aligned himself with Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, some said
obsequiously so. But Donnelly, on occasion, was not afraid to
challenge the fiery Rostenkowski. Donnelly helped repeal a program
to provide health insurance for catastrophic illness, for example,
because he believed the bill unfairly burdened the elderly through
higher premiums.
</P>
<P>
   His contributions to the 11th District were evident in many
other ways, for which he is not believed to have ever held a press
conference in his 14 years in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people ever got a sense of his importance _
particularly during a period that was an extraordinarily difficult
one for Massachusetts, the recession of the early '90s. Brian just
produced on a constant basis on a whole variety of things,'' said
Chester Atkins, a Massachusetts congressman from 1984 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put together the legislative blueprint for federal support
for the tunnel and artery project,'' Atkins said. ``The same is
true for the harbor cleanup. In large measure, federal support for
that money was Brian's creation. He had an extraordinary
partnership with Joe (Moakley) and Tip (O'Neill) in both those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   He also sought tougher monitoring of hospital spending, and
championed more public benefits from tax-exempt bonds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Conservative streak &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his ``big D'' politics, Donnelly also showed a
conservative streak. He opposed abortion, backed a constitutional
amendment to ban desecration of the flag, and once complained that
Democrats had become ``the party of the gays, the abortionists, the
far-out feminists, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   (He softened his abortion stand before entering the governor's
race this year. While he continues to be personally opposed to it,
he said he would not pursue a ban against abortion as governor.)
</P>
<P>
   His influence even spread abroad. In 1986, Donnelly won approval
for a program that allowed thousands of illegal aliens to become US
citizens. The ``Donnelly visas'' were regarded as a godsend by
immigrants _ especially by native Irish in Massachusetts _ who had
been living on under-the-table income for years. The congressman's
name became a household word in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly was discovered to have written 70 overdrafts in an
investigation of the House Bank scandal, but the Justice Department
cleared him in 1992 of any criminal wrongdoing. The probe is not
believed to have influenced his decision not to seek reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, like many other legislators and friends interviewed for
this report, said they were stunned when Donnelly announced he
would not seek reelection in 1992. US Representative Richard Neal
of Springfield, who believes he is the first congressman Donnelly
told of his decision, thought Donnelly was kidding for the first
half-hour of their conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there ever was a fellow who was positioned to move inside
the House, it was Brian Donnelly,'' Neal said last week. A close
friend of then-House Speaker Thomas Foley, Donnelly had established
himself by 1992 as a consummate inside player, working legislation
through Congress by low-key persuasion and quiet maneuvering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an absolutely natural legislator, who was able to cut
across party lines, cut across individual factions, and work with
the leadership and the back-benchers,'' said Atkins, who is
supporting McGovern, his successor as chairman of the state Senate
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just an easy-going, friendly guy that anybody would want
to have a beer with. Ultimately, people feel comfortable talking
with Brian and opening up to him. He's the antithesis of the
new-school, blow-dried, press-release, superficial kind of
politician.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A much-needed vacation &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Donnelly declined to run for mayor in 1993, and then for
governor in 1994, many political observers doubted his statements
that he merely wanted to spend more time with his wife and two
children. But Donnelly insists he was tired of the political grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't cut the cord, I would have been (in Congress) for
the rest of my life,'' Donnelly said over lunch at Linda Mae's, a
Dorchester restaurant where the owner calls him ``B'' and old
friends greet him with smiles and handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   His children, now 16 and 12, were growing up as he spent his
weeks in an efficiency apartment near Capitol Hill. Donnelly flew
home for hectic weekends that included plenty of politicking.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday night, you'd be off to Florian Hall in Dorchester
for someone's retirement party, then off to Brockton for some other
function, and then you'd be lugged home,'' Donnelly recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday I spent with the kids. But on Saturday night, there'd
be three more functions. On Sundays, I spoke at more Communion
breakfasts than most bishops.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of more 14-hour days in the political world _ even as
mayor of the city he loves _ Donnelly opted for the unfamiliar but
less frantic life as US ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago from 1994
to 1997. In the interim, he sold his house in Dorchester. He
currently lives in the family's former summer home in East Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Donnelly says, all he wants to be is governor. He knows his
way around the State House _ whose politics he still considers
``the big time'' compared with Washington's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been in government, I know the power a governor has to
effect change. You can do something,'' he says. ``That's why it's
worth it to go through the holy hell that politics is sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that hell may have been evident last weekend during
Donnelly's visit to the Marshfield Fair. At a candidates' forum
designed to include old-fashioned stump speeches, Donnelly was one
of only two gubernatorial candidates in attendance _ Republican
Joseph D. Malone was the other.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly delivered a short, animated speech about health care
under a broiling sun to fewer than two dozen people _ all campaign
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he made a quick circuit through a carnival crowd that
probably did not include many primary voters. But Donnelly shook
hands, asked boys about their favorite ballplayers, and never
stopped smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The appearance demonstrated his weakness _ that of a methodical
candidate in an electronic age _ but it also underscored the
strength of a man whose personality rarely fails to impress.
</P>
<P>
   As he headed toward the exit, Donnelly introduced himself to
Carol Holbrook of Plympton, a taco and nacho vendor who later
described herself as ``the most unpolitical person you could
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just shook my hand and said, `I'll see you around,'''
Holbrook said. ``That's sort of a polite way of saying, `I hope you
vote for me.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a different approach from the pushy kind. And, you
know, I liked it.''

<P>
   FALL RIVER, Mass. _ Brian Donnelly, Democratic candidate for
governor, stands on the century-old steps of the city library as
nearby panhandlers look for a ``rush hour'' donation in a tired
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Donnelly, dark-metal letters declare this temple-like
hall of granite to be ``the people's university.'' Noble thought
and immigrant inspiration, the words recall a time when Fall River
was a bustling place of ready work and broad hope.
</P>
<P>
   But those times are decades past, and that's why Donnelly is
here. Inside ``the people's university,'' two-thirds of the books
are buried in stacks that are barred to the public. Plaster peels
from walls surrounding an elegant, Italianate hall. Cramped offices
are made even more uncomfortable by large boxes used as storage.
</P>
<P>
   Regina E. Slezak, the library administrator, was stunned this
month when Acting Governor Paul Cellucci vetoed a $590,000 plan to
renovate the library, despite a $1 billion surplus in the state
treasury.
</P>
<P>
   To her, the Fall River library isn't a pork barrel project _ not
in a city where 53 percent of adults do not have a high school
diploma. To Slezak, the building represents hope for a place that
needs plenty of it _ and Donnelly speaks her language.
</P>
<P>
   The former ambassador and seven-term congressman, a Dorchester
native who wielded power quietly but effectively in Washington,
tells Slezak he will renovate the building if elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I'll do as governor is send a supplemental
budget through the Legislature and restore the library funding,''
Donnelly says. Slezak smiles warmly in a water-stained room where
the library hopes to hold its centennial ball next year.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly, after 45 minutes of earnest listening and empathy, may
have found another vote or two. But the excruciating mechanics of
such old-fashioned politics may be both his chief virtue and his
primary undoing.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly, 52, was badly hampered by a late start in the
governor's race and slowed even further by a campaign treasury that
puts its limited funds into radio ads on mostly small stations.
That bare-bones effort, now operating with $30,000 in the bank,
contrasts starkly with those of his rivals, Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger, and former state senator Patricia McGovern, who are
plowing millions of dollars into the race. Both will likely have
enough money to wage a TV advertising war. Donnelly may not.
</P>
<P>
   How Donnelly, an insider who had the ear of powerful House
speakers, could find himself scrambling for single votes at poorly
attended functions is a big question of this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Why he continues is another. But after a lifetime in politics,
quitting the game isn't easy.
</P>
<P>
   As someone who has never lost a race, he insists he knew the
pitfalls of running statewide, running late, and running from last.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how difficult it was,'' he said. ``When I was meeting
with supporters, I was asking all the hard questions: `Are we going
to be able to raise the money?'
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of people who were saying, `No problem, no
problem,' but I knew it was going to be a tough task.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly is banking that his retail style will resonate with
hard-core Democrats most likely to vote Sept. 15, and that the
large undecided bloc _ estimated at 40 percent _ will tilt his way.
</P>
<P>
   But if they do, the credit will go almost solely to the
lunch-bucket efforts of a candidate who has not attracted active,
institutional backing from his own party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got nothing'' in campaign support, said political analyst
Lou DiNatale, senior fellow at the University of Massachusetts'
McCormack Institute. ``He reminds me of the troops on D-Day.
They're getting chopped up bad, and they ask where the air cover
is, and they're saying they missed the beach.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Abandoned by party &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of many around Donnelly, the candidate has been
abandoned by influential Democrats, including Massachusetts
congressional dean J. Joseph Moakley, who have not been active in
the campaign apparently because of Donnelly's reluctance to use
television. Donnelly has not aired one TV advertisement yet, nor
has he attempted to lure TV coverage with policy announcements and
other media events.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders told Donnelly that they would not help him unless
he helped himself _ and that television was the way to go, like it
or not.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, political consultant Ed Jesser, a 30-year friend of
Donnelly's, left the campaign abruptly because of the candidate's
unwillingness to call press conferences that might bring him
much-needed television exposure. Donnelly's quirky trait of
campaigning quietly away from the glare of the media spotlight has
been a hallmark of his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree on campaign tactics, but I still think he's the
best candidate,'' Jesser said.
</P>
<P>
   Donnelly hurt his chances further when he decided this summer
not to transfer $300,000 from his unused congressional kitty to the
gubernatorial campaign. Although the move would have been legal if
he paid himself the money first, the subsequent transfer to a state
account would have skirted campaign finance laws and probably led
to a series of negative stories and accusations from opponents
about where the money came from.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing the ethical issues the move might raise and the damage
to his widely held reputation for self-effacing decency, Donnelly
decided not to take the money over the objections of his
strategists. If he loses the primary, Donnelly said, all the money
will be placed in a charitable trust.
</P>
<P>
   With the scarce funds available to him, Donnelly said he might
buy targeted cable-television ads to spread his message statewide.
That message, rooted in New Deal philosophies long revered in
ethnic neighborhoods like Dorchester, preaches government's
responsibility to improve the lot ``of the little guy,'' Donnelly
said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a Donnelly administration, the state would plow about half
the surplus _ or roughly $500 million _ back into schools and
infrastructure. The other funds would be returned as tax relief, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Donnelly proposals include relief for water and sewer
ratepayers who foot the gargantuan bill for the Boston Harbor
cleanup; automobile insurance rates based on a driver's safety
record rather than residence; a higher minimum wage; a state
challenge grant that rewards innovative after-school day care; and
a Massachusetts medical authority that would consolidate the many
state agencies that oversee managed health care.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of his list, in addition to schools, is a desire to
help the cities of Massachusetts garner a greater share of the good
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to have this opportunity again,'' Donnelly
said of the state's revenue bonanza. ``We have to invest in the
education of children in this state. It's the best investment we
can make in our economic future, and it's also the moral thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   With money from the surplus, Donnelly said, he would ``build and
repair and replace every school in this commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat with a big D,'' Donnelly added. ``I'm not
saying the other candidates aren't, but I am.''
</P>
<P>
   That brand of ``big D'' Democratic thinking was nurtured in a
home of first-generation Irish-American parents in the Lower Mills
section of Dorchester. The youngest of four children, Donnelly was
raised on Clearwater Drive in as political an environment as 1950s
urban America could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Francis (Sweepstakes) Kelly, a former attorney general and
lieutenant governor, was his uncle. Another uncle served on the
Boston City Council. Mayor John B. Hynes lived nearby. A family
friend's aunt was secretary to legendary US House Speaker John
McCormack. And those were just the politicians who were successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in a house where people like James Michael Curley
and John Kennedy were revered,'' Donnelly says. ``Politics was
absolutely part of the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Donnelly, the son of a state public works engineer and a
part-time waitress, the call to politics had less to do with
history than with the sense that his neighborhood's fabric was
fraying.

SADDAM'S LATEST PROVOCATION COULD PROVE COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- I would hate to be the poor Iraqi who will have to
explain to Saddam Hussein in the next few weeks what the dimensions
of his ``triumph'' over the United States and the United Nations
are.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, his latest provocation aimed at UN arms control
inspectors may have stopped inspections, but at a cost that is
going to infuriate the Iraqi dictator. And his latest provocation
has made pointless his endless attempts to divide members of the UN
Security Council over the issue of the economic sanctions that
pinch Iraq with unprecedented severity.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the deal with the UN last February that narrowly
averted what would have been major air strikes, there is another
council resolution on the books today that exposes Iraq both to
sanctions in perpetuity and to attack should Saddam break its
terms. And it leaves the US free (probably in concert with Britain)
to take military action, regardless of the accommodationist
activity of soft-liners on the Council, notably France and Russia,
should there be any effort by Iraq to reconstitute its chemical,
biological, or nuclear weapons capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the conventional view of what has happened around
here. That view holds that the US and UN have capitulated to Iraq
and that the Clinton adminstration and Blair's government have
fatally undermined the inspections regime to avoid a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   It is starting to creep into partisan politics via Speaker
Gingrich, and the entire matter hit the headlines in a major way
with the resignation of senior arms inspector Scott Ridder and his
assertion that the US had pressured the UN in recent months to
delay or cancel the surprise inspections for which Ritter is
famously aggressive, including one that had been tentatively set
for last Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   To start in the middle, that assertion has been flatly denied by
the chief UN arms inspector, Richard Butler of Australia, who was
Ritter's highly regarded boss.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the intelligence information that has always been the
most reliable guide for the inspectors has come chiefly from US
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But what UN inspection as well as top US policymakers confirm is
that the US and Britain have on occasion stressed to Butler their
concern about keeping the basic Security Council support for its
tough resolution on inspections intact. In practice that has meant
that Butler has put off surprise inspection raids in order to give
Saddam's friends in Paris and Moscow no cause to complain about
tactics on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the ritual has been for Iraq to target specific
inspection practices or specific inspectors (Ritter is by no means
the first) and provoke crises where he had some UN support among
what one top US official called ``his lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has spent the last seven years since the Gulf War
periodically jerking everyone around,'' this official said. ``Well,
we decided to end that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the consequence of Iraq's truly stupid move to end any
and all compliance with the UN inspections. France and Russian
can't help Iraq now; a clear UN resolution as well as Saddam's own
deal with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan have been violated. The
economic sanctions can't be touched.
</P>
<P>
   But the same resolution also authorizes military force in the
event of its violation. What is different now is that the US,
Britain, and anyone else who chooses to help, will not go to war
simply to operate a UN inspection regime; instead, we will use
force to prevent Iraq from reconstituting the capability it
developed during the 1980s to make weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It is chic these days to assume that because of the Monica
Lewinsky affair President Clinton is paralyzed and the credibility
of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Sandy Bergern national
security adviser, has been compromised.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what appears to have happened is that sometime last
spring the president secretly changed his policy to get around
Iraq's repeated provocations over the years. One reason the change
was secret was to not let Saddam know about it. The other reason is
that it almost certainly has some covert elements directed at his
hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, despite domestic and international opposition, the
US would have used significant military force had it not been for
the last-minute deal with the UN. The result of that deal was not
breathing room for Iraq, but a more clear definition of his rules.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, everyone would prefer that the inspections proceed.
But in their absence _ as witness the reliance on US agencies for
tips _ the US has ample resources in space, in the air, on the
ground, and through friends like Israel to closely monitor
developments inside Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Saddam Hussein has now lost any hope of serious
diplomatic help on the tough economic sanctions still in place; and
he will remain vulnerable to force should he even try to build
terror weapons.
</P>
<P>
   This is victory?

GUBERNATORIAL LEADERS PLOT EFFECTIVE TACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Primary campaigns are like a race in the rapids: A
successful candidate needs to pick a course through the rips that
will not only bring him first to the finish line, but get him there
buoyant, unswamped, and well-positioned for the general election
whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Two new Boston Globe/WBZ-TV polls provide strong evidence that
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, the Republican front-runner, and
Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, the Democratic leader, have
each chosen a smart course.
</P>
<P>
   But the polls also suggest that state Treasurer Joseph D.
Malone, Cellucci's Republican rival, has miscalculated badly by
steering too far to starboard.
</P>
<P>
   And as for the two other Democrats, former state senator
Patricia McGovern and former US representative Brian Donnelly, the
polls back up a general sense they have been swamped by the demands
of running a statewide campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, of course, benefits enormously from holding the
governor's office. In a party historically reluctant to toss out
its officeholders, having the incumbency in economic good times
helps explain the 55 percent to 30 percent lead he holds over
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the new polls' most striking finding suggests that
Malone has plotted almost exactly the wrong course through the
Republican rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting the cookie-cutter formula of GOP consultant Arthur
Finkelstein, Malone has largely eschewed specific proposals in
favor of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on TV ads to tag
Cellucci a liberal and claim the conservative mantle. Malone's hope
is that a low-turnout primary, one that attracts few independents,
will give conservatives a disproportionate voice.
</P>
<P>
   But two problems loom like jagged rocks in the river.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the GOP electorate simply isn't buying the
distinction. Only 12 percent said Cellucci was a liberal, compared
to 47 percent who thought him a moderate and 27 percent who
considered him a conservative. (Only 27 percent of Malone's own
supporters called the acting governor a liberal, while 65 percent
thought he was moderate or conservative.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of trying to draw that ideological distinction,
Malone's numbers were similar to Cellucci's: 5 percent said he was
a liberal, 23 percent a moderate, and 44 percent a conservative.
</P>
<P>
   But the second problem is more telling: According to one of the
Globe polls, self-described conservatives support Cellucci over
Malone 47 percent to 41 percent. Self-professed liberals among GOP
primary voters also favor Cellucci 53 percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Said pollster Gerry Chervinsky: ``I think Malone has run
absolutely the wrong campaign ... It is not working.''
</P>
<P>
   It might have worked better had Cellucci allowed Malone any room
to his right as a tax-cutter; the new survey indicates tax cuts are
vitally important to GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci has stressed tax cutting from day one, going so far
as to escort Barbara Anderson, co-director of Citizens for Limited
Taxation &AMP; Government when she dropped off her tax-cutting question
last August just so Malone couldn't have the photo opportunity all
to himself.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the new poll shows that Harshbarger, who
has by far the best financed and functioning Democratic campaign,
has simply overwhelmed his underfunded rivals. The best evidence of
that: When likely Democratic primary voters were asked in last
week's poll how many gubernatorial candidates they could name, 71
percent knew Harshbarger, 67 percent cited Cellucci, and 44 named
Malone. But only 36 percent were aware that McGovern is running,
and only 29 percent were cognizant of Donnelly's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poll results suggest that Harshbarger, who has run
for office by ignoring his Democratic opposition and instead taking
on Cellucci at every turn, has impressed Democratic primary votes
with that approach. It's also likely that his ability to run paid
TV ads as early as last spring and to take to the airwaves again
this month has helped establish him as the party's only realistic
choice for the general election.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence: Harshbarger holds a commanding margin across all
age, income, and demographic subsets of the Democratic primary
electorate.
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger also appears to have chosen well when it comes
to his issue mix, in particular by stressing education. The
attorney general has pledged, for example, to increase education
spending by $163 million annually and to chair the state Board of
Education himself. He also proposed a $1.5 billion tax cut at the
start of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But if Harshbarger is exceedingly well-positioned for the
Democratic primary, the poll also suggests that Cellucci will have
considerable appeal to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, after all, has also made a point of emphasizing both,
bragging about education reform, embracing teacher training and
testing, and working to expand health insurance for children and
the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Republicans reject the notion that Cellucci is a
liberal, more Democrats approve of Cellucci than disapprove, by a
margin of 40 percent to 36 percent. ``I'm going to argue that ...
Cellucci is in decent shape in the general election,'' Chervinsky
said. ``These are Democrats, and he is still a net positive.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows there is plenty of room to argue over more
tax cuts, which Cellucci favors, versus increased social spending,
which Harshbarger has called for. While 71 percent of those
Democrats polled said they would be more likely to vote for a
governor who favored further lowering the income tax rate, a
somewhat contradictory 55 percent later said funding education,
health care, day care, and environmental programs is more important
then cutting the tax rate. Twenty-one percent wanted more tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, predictably, are more strongly in favor of cutting
taxes, with 50 percent saying more tax cuts should take precedence
over more spending, 31 percent preferring more spending, and 17
percent favoring some of both.
</P>
<P>
   Those results set up a classic sort of Democrat-Republican
debate, one both of the two leading candidates seem eager to
engage.

Virginian John Randolph, who denigrated a political opponent this
way: ``Your record, sir, resembles a rotting mackerel by moonlight:
It shines and it stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to say the same of this book.
</P>
<P>
   The uneven prose ranges from pedestrian to purple in former
governor William F. Weld's authorial debut, a stab at political
suspense and intrigue. The plot's premise is somewhere between
implausible and preposterous _ hotshot New York prosecutor,
recruited by local police unions, becomes overnight sensation in
Boston politics. The storyline sputters through prosecutorial argot
and arcana, including nearly two pages each of boilerplate from a
witness-cooperation agreement and ``Application for Full Field
Investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Mackerel'' is not without some redeeming qualities, most
of parochial interest to local readers eager to play a game of
``Where's Weldo?''
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist-narrator is Terry Mullally, an orphaned New
Yorker of Irish stock, who often bears an astonishing resemblance
to the Brahmin Weld, an intriguing, complex public figure who
retreated to private law practice last year. Ethnicity aside, both
are outdoorsmen with photographic memories, a fondness for strong
drink, and reputations made prosecuting remarkably similar cases.
</P>
<P>
   And like Weld, a former US attorney, Mullally is transformed
from anticorruption crusader to cynical politician, embracing good
policies only when they are the serendipitous residue of good
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be such a nice boy before I met you,'' Mullally
tells his political consultant, who has advised him to lie about an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boss, this whole process is calculated to make honest men act
like felons,'' the adviser responds. ``Sooner we absorb that, the
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld does have a feel for the tribalism of the politics and
culture of this area. His account of the South Boston St. Patrick's
Day roast rings true. It should: Weld dusts off some of his own
material, including the line about a South Boston ward boss in
charge of 500 voters who reside in St. Augustine's Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has spent time with Weld or followed his career will
recognize plenty of his recycled material. For example: ``Only two
times I'll take a drink,'' Terry tells his love interest. ``When
I'm fishin', and when I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   Weld also has some fun at the expense of his old-money Yankee
peers and illuminates their distinctive subsets. ``Your beautiful
people may hail from Weston, or Dover, or Sherborn, and they are
Very Important and Captains of Finance, and Trustees of this and
that,'' a law colleague tells Mullally on the way to a dinner
party. ``These here tonight are basically North Shore people,
serious drinkers _ not so easy to find nowadays _ most of them with
places in town, too, and the wonderful thing about them is they
know they're no good.''
</P>
<P>
   But the narrative is often strained or flat-out dreadful, as in
this observation, which reads like Mickey Spillane after a rough
night: ``I was sitting on a bar stool in the East Seventies, trying
to kill an hour that just wouldn't die.''
</P>
<P>
   Or how about Weld dazzling us with his knowledge of fishing? ``I
handed Emma my eight-foot Leonard, Hardy Bros. reel, number four
line with plenty of backing, 3X tapered leader, and a red and brown
streamer I had tied myself: mottled wild turkey feathers for the
wing, wood duck flank feathers for the shoulder, a red head and a
number-six hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for sharing, Gadabout Gaddis.
</P>
<P>
   Or Weld, the nimrod, describing his handiwork, a pigeon
slaughter in the barn of a rural farm? ``We nearly melted the
barrels of our 20-gauges, must have shot five or six boxes of
shells apiece. I was glad I had only a recent vintage Franchi. Any
Damascus steel, in a fine old gun like the Purdy I had bought in
London, would have been ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   A tragedy averted, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Weld crams 238 pages with cop talk and political wiseguy
chatter, yet no one utters a single word of profanity. There is
also an obligatory sex scene, but Weld demurely spares us the
titillating details. In fact, he spares us any details.
</P>
<P>
   As narrator Mullally tells us: ``It was the most natural thing
in the world for us to become intimate, as we did.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is one of the book's high points.

ENGLAND'S LEGEND-LADEN PENINSULA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARAZION, England _ The very southwestern tip of England, the
county of Cornwall is a place set apart. Not only by geography but
also by distinctive Celtic traditions and antiquities, starkly
beautiful landscapes, and a climate so mild and un-British that
even palm trees flourish.
</P>
<P>
   The Penwith Peninsula, the toe of the boot-shaped county, is
Cornwall in microcosm. Snug fishing villages, surf-battered
headlands, sandy sheltered coves, prehistoric standing stones and
ceremonial circles, old tin-mining villages, windswept moors, and
gardens of almost tropical lushness _ all are to be found in a
day's drive around it.
</P>
<P>
   You can also discover the unexpected, such as St. Michael's
Mount. Known locally as ``the jewel in Cornwall's crown,'' St.
Michael's Mount rises dramatically like a mirage out of Mount's Bay
on the south coast of the peninsula. Two thirds of the time, the
mount _ a 200-foot-high granite crag topped by the ancient walls
and towers of a former monastery _ is an island. But for four hours
twice a day, during low tide, it's linked to the small fishing
village of Marazion by a cobblestoned causeway.
</P>
<P>
   The mount got it's name in the fifth century, the story goes,
when a local fisherman had a vision of St. Michael standing on its
summit. The Normans, who conquered Britain in 1066, were struck by
the resemblance to Mont St. Michel in Normandy _ also a tidal
island dedicated to St. Michael _ and established an important
Benedictine monastery on the mount.
</P>
<P>
   After the Reformation, when the English monasteries were
dissolved, the mount became a military garrison. In the mid-17th
century, it was acquired by the aristocratic St. Aubyn family, who,
over the next three centuries, enlarged and remodeled the medieval
buildings to create one of the finest, and certainly most romantic,
stately homes in England.
</P>
<P>
   The mount is now operated by the National Trust and open to the
public but is still the residence of Lord St. Levan, head of the
St. Aubyn family. At high tide St. Michael's Mount is accessible by
water taxi from Marazion. However, to get the full effect, it's
best to wait for low tide and walk the causeway, approaching the
looming mount on foot and climbing the steep and stony path to the
top, much as a medieval pilgrim would have done.
</P>
<P>
   Except for one private wing reserved for the lord of the manor,
visitors can roam freely around the mount. You can walk the walls
(which have a wonderful view of the rocky coastline) and inspect
the armory, library, banquet hall (originally the monks'
refractory), kitchen and drawing rooms. All the rooms have original
furnishings, paintings, and mementos acquired by generations of St.
Aubyns. Probably the oddest piece of bric-a-brac is a scale model
of the mount, made by one of the family's butlers _ out of
champagne corks.
</P>
<P>
   The old priory church, a small jewel of a medieval chapel,
stands at the highest point of the mount, where St. Michael
appeared to the fisherman. It is still the parish church of a small
community of fishermen and their families who live at the base of
the mount.
</P>
<P>
   Just west of Marazion on the main road (the A394) is Penzance,
the best-known town in Cornwall, thanks to the Gilbert and Sullivan
operetta ``The Pirates of Penzance.'' There actually is a pirate in
Penzance, a wooden one permanently perched looking out to sea with
a spyglass on the roof of the Admiral Benbow Inn on Chapel Street,
built in 1696 and once a smugglers' hangout. On the same street is
the flamboyantly un-Cornish Egyptian House, built as a geological
museum in 1835 in the style of a temple in Luxor.
</P>
<P>
   Penzance is known for its beach, laidback atmosphere, and views
of Mount's Bay and St. Michael's Mount. There is some artsy-craftsy
shopping, but mostly Penzance feels and looks like the kind of
Regency resort where Jane Austen characters went to take the sea
air. A few miles north of Penzance, on the edge of a bleakly
beautiful moor, is another kind of old town: Chysauster, an
excavated farming village dating back to the second century, when
the Romans ruled England.
</P>
<P>
   Farther down the coast is Mousehole (pronounced MOU-zel), a
charmer of a seaside village of small stone cottages so tightly
packed together that the streets between them are little more than
sandy footpaths. Smuggling, much romanticized in novels such as
``Frenchman's Creek'' by Daphne du Maurier, was a lucrative Cornish
activity in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Mousehole apparently
was named for a cave where local smugglers stored their contraband.
</P>
<P>
   A plaque on one Mousehole cottage identifies it as the home of
Dolly Pentreath, who died in 1777 and was the last native speaker
of Cornish, a Celtic tongue akin to Breton and Welsh. Although no
longer spoken, the ancient language lives on in Cornwall's many
exotic-sounding place names such as Zennor, Lostwithiel,
Perranzabuloe, Kelynack, and Porthcurno.
</P>
<P>
   Land's End is the farthermost point in Cornwall, the end of the
road and of Britain. A high, windswept headland where waves crash
and foam against the base of granite cliffs and the sea stretches
to the horizon on three sides, it really feels more like the end of
the world. Land's End is an intrinsically awesome place, and even
the presence of a rather tacky, small theme park, The Land's End
Experience, can't diminish it.

WHERE THE 15TH CENTURY LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUGGE, Belgium _ Disney, eat your Goofy heart out.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a theme park beyond anything in Walt's wake,
it's this leftover from the Middle Ages, the old-town neighborhood
of Brugge, that somehow has slipped unbruised through two
enveloping world wars, and happily proclaims, ``Here's 15th century
in your face, kind visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, somebody built it, like any tourist Mousequeteer trap. But
this happened so long ago that the ducks in the surrounding river
and criss-crossing canals claim no kinship to Donald. Having had
hundreds of years to age and mature, this medieval melange of
Gothic, Baroque, and various lowlands styles, a treasurehouse of
art and craft, has benefited from great preservation consciousness
and a human procession intent on making a pleasant place to
inhabit. The Flemish, whose Belgian precinct this is, figure they
got it right in the dim and distant first place. Why update or call
in the developers?
</P>
<P>
   Someone might feel that way about Disneyland in a couple of
centuries _ maybe _ but here's the difference. Brugge vibrantly
lives and is lived in by genuine people, occupants for generations.
Yes, many do prosper off the wayfarers' francs, but the burghers
are so polite and friendly that I wonder why I've given Belgium a
miss for so long. Despite the movie, ``If It's Tuesday It Must be
Belgium,'' this small country is worthy of much more than a
drive-by shorting.
</P>
<P>
   The walled old town is largely limited to foot traffic. Entered
by a drawbridge at Kruispoort, it is a stroller's dream, a
flashback to times when you might have gawked at the carriages
bearing such kings as Charles the Bald and Charles the Bold, the
latter presumably enjoying better hair days.
</P>
<P>
   Carriages yet abound, pulled by smartly-groomed horses, driven
by men (and a few women) in captain's hats, skimmers, and derbies
but for hire by anybody. The civic-minded horses do their bit for
local hygiene and cleanliness by wearing outhouse devices.
</P>
<P>
   Available, too, are open motor launches, prowling the canals
that are tunnels of love for ancient architecture. Some of the
structures, painted in vivid shades such as peach, cherry, cream,
and lemon, are stunning brick houses with steps rising to a
triangular point on either side of third- and fourth-story facades.
Graceful stone bridges, the elder bearded with ivy and dating to
1390, could make you bald if you're too bold to duck at the pilot's
command. Lilac windowpanes, much older than those on Boston's
Beacon Hill, have come from another canal town, Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Walking along narrow cobbled streets, through broad squares
edged with spires and towers of majestically decorated municipal
buildings and churches, snooping in thriving outdoor marketplaces,
you feel blood pressure plunging to a very peaceful level, in tune
with softly chiming carillons.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny angelic marble faces _ called ``diamonds'' _ gaze at you
from their timeless hangouts on walls and storefronts. Swans huddle
and honk in a sequestered park beside the canal. In the leafy
courtyard of a 13th-century convent called the Beguinage, aged,
highly-risen poplars _ possibly coverted by scores of years of
winter winds _ bow to the east prayerfully. Within the chapel the
voices of Benedictine nuns give new sweetness to Gregorian chants.
</P>
<P>
   In a time before most people could read, shopkeepers hung
pennants outside their doors depicting the nature of the business.
A shoemaker. A carpenter. A lacemaker. Such pennants still fly
amusingly, some with a modern touch. Its avid tongue out and ready
for action, a lion decorates the Haagen-Dazs emporium.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, plenty of recognizable brands of sneakers, apparel,
electronic equipment are to be found. Charlie Rockett's Tex-Mex
restaurant is around the corner from our hotel. You can't avoid
these things even in the Middle Ages. But, conforming to the decor,
they don't spoil the atmosphere. And at least the plumbing is 20th
century. Nobody dumps garbage or sewage on unlucky passersby from
an upstairs window as customary when the town was young.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Brugge's staples remain those of the country
itself: lace and chocolate in all imaginable shapes and forms plus
high-test beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two or three of our beers and you might be walking on all
fours,'' chuckles a hardy, quick-stepping guide, Gustav Ulster, who
has lived here almost three-quarters of this century, and likes
also being part of a much earlier century. ``It is very good beer''
(indeed!) ``but I advise you to stop after one. Savor it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get straws and split one,'' says my friend, Aurelio.
``We can get to the bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gustav says that's not quite the spirit, while pointing to a
landmark dedicated to the holy spirit: the bell tower of the Church
of Our Lady that soars like an arrow 400 feet above the town.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the top of it, he says, ``took 18 generations of
masons and bricklayers in the 13th and 14th centuries. Imagine all
those men who worked their lifetimes and never saw their work
completed. That spire crowns one of the highest brick buildings in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inside you must see Michelangelo's sculpture of the Madonna
and Child.''
</P>
<P>
   Pure serenity in marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is our proudest possession, but many think it is
the Holy Blood.'' Every Friday at the Basilica of the Holy Blood, a
transparent receptacle is displayed containing small coagulated
splotches said to be drops of Christ's blood. Supposedly the
treasure was collected in the Holy Land during the Second Crusade
in the 12th century by Thierry d'Alsace, count of Flanders, and
bestowed on Brugge. A sanguine story.
</P>
<P>
   Sanguine steak and lamb chops took the raw, damp edge off the
previous evening at a small but extraordinary wine bar called Heer
Haewyn. Flames leaping at a hearth meant warmth, at the least, as
we peered through the drizzle-spattered window, seeking shelter and
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any food?'' I said hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few things from the grill,'' answered Leen ver Kempinck from
behind the bar. ``Frans will take care of your dinner. Please sit
near the fire. I'm called Mrs. Fetchwine around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, such things. With exquisite timing and feeling for the meat,
and the baking potatoes, Frans van den Heede tended the
wood-burning fire, cooked, and waited on the room as he's done for
two decades. Simple, and simply marvelous.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner at the Hotel Walburg a night later is a different
proposition. Unexpected elegance at a virtually undiscovered prize.
Just opened, the Walburg, a severely handsome whitewashed stone
building of three stories, is really a Brugge juvenile, a mere 137
years of age. It has had several lives, though _ mansion of an
affluent family, hospital, rooming house, finally busted-down
derelict.
</P>
<P>
   However, the death certificate wasn't final. An ambitious young
couple, Gaston and Bieke Vandewiele-Nuytten, felt its ruined pulse,
sensed a flicker of life, and put the derelict into rehab. With
loving care, admirable taste, a bundle of borrowed money, and
remarkable patience with contractors over a period of three years,
they brought their dear Walburg back to health, and, they hope,
self-supporting respect as a hotel with 13 beautifully-appointed,
high-ceilinged rooms and a back garden.
</P>
<P>
   With ornate moldings, Grecian statuary, the grand staircase and
balustrades restored, and thick carpeting roaming up and down,
Walburg exudes both freshness and experience as a comeback kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a struggle for a long time,'' says Gaston, ``but we
are willing. She runs the hotel, I operate the kitchen.'' That
means he's the chef, an excellent one.
</P>
<P>
   As the only guests this weekend, we feel installed in a scene
from ``Last Year at Marienbad,'' the film about a bygone exclusive
European resort. Alone in the chandeliered diningroom, beneath a
bouquet-clutching plaster maid in her alcove, and amid tables laid
out in gorgeous linens, silver and candles, we undergo a command
performance by Gaston, a long-order cook with a short guest list.
</P>
<P>
   Classical music plays as each course is delivered by Derk, the
waiter who looks like Forrest Gump in a tux. Scallops, shrimp,
salmon, asparagus, rack of lamb pass in review, A to Z: artichokes
to zabaglione.
</P>
<P>
   In their palaces, Charles the Bald and Charles the Bold never
had it so good.

YES, THE PLANE FLEW VERY FAST

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here Part 2 of travel agent stories making the rounds on
computers _ tales that again prove that agents sometimes need
plenty of patience and fortitude:
</P>
<P>
   _A woman needed to know how it was possible that her flight from
Detroit left at 8:20 a.m. and got into Chicago at 8:33 a.m. The
agent tried to explain that Michigan was an hour ahead of Illinois,
but she could not grasp the concept of time zones. Finally, the
agent told her the plane went very fast, and she bought that.
</P>
<P>
   _A man asked, ``Is it possible to see England from Canada?'' No,
said the agent. His reply: ``But they look so close on the map.''
</P>
<P>
   _A woman provided her agent with a list of hotels in Los Angeles
that she would consider staying in. But the agent could locate none
of them. Turned out that she had given him a list of hotels in New
Orleans. The client had thought the ``LA'' in the mailing address
stood for Los Angeles, not Louisiana, and that New Orleans was an
L.A. suburb.
</P>
<P>
   _A caller asked if he could rent a car in Dallas, although he
was only going to be there an hour. ``Why?'' he was asked. He
replied, ``I heard Dallas was a big airport, and I need a car to
drive between the gates to save time.''
</P>
<P>
   _A businessman was told he'd need a visa to fly to China. ``Oh
no I don't,'' he said. ``I've been to China many times and never
had to have one of those. Every time they have accepted my American
Express.''
</P>

 &UR; Luggage contest: &LR;  Could your luggage or briefcase tell a story

HURRICANE POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hello, Bonnie. We wish you weren't around, but we know you'll be
followed, even as we speak, by Danielle and other future
hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   The question for travelers at this time of year is whether or
not to book a Caribbean island vacation or cruise. And if you do
book and have to cancel, what happens to the money you paid up
front?
</P>
<P>
   On cruises, the answer is simple. If a hurricane is in the
ship's path, the liner heads for a new port of call, most likely
one that isn't on its itinerary. There's no reason to complain or
seek a refund, for if you read the fine print in the cruise
brochure, you'll see a change in itinerary is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise lines do everything possible to make each sailing as
smooth as possible _ they want you back.
</P>
<P>
   Resorts are a different story. They can't move. So it's best to
see if they have a hurricane policy. Some do.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bahamas, hoteliers will allow vacationers to use their
deposit or payment for a future stay, in the event of a hurricane.
Those who cannot reach the islands because of the weather will be
given a full refund on their deposit. Those already in the Bahamas
will be granted reduced rates if they are forced to stay on longer
than their itinerary calls for.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons Resort Nevis, one of the best in the Caribbean,
has a September Vacation Guarantee that provides a full refund of
the deposit plus a refund of the land portion of the cost of a
resort's package or guestroom for the days affected or interrupted
by a hurricane.???? The policy is good Sept. 1-30.
</P>
<P>
   On Jamaica, SuperClubs offers a Guaranteed Getaways package that
includes a reimbursement for the total value of nights disrupted by
a hurricane. SuperResorts also has a Jamaica Sunshine Guarantee
that promises daily sunshine or guests will receive a voucher equal
to the value of the days lost. At Sandals Resorts, a Blue Chip
Hurricane Guarantee provides guests with a free replacement
vacation with air fare if a hurricane hits one of their resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Many tour operators also offer a travel protection plan, at
additional cost, that allows guests to cancel their vacation up to
24 hours prior to departure in the event of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   Policies, as you can see, differ and may require the purchase of
insurance (usually at a reasonable cost) to weather the storm. The
best policy, if you are traveling in areas affected by hurricanes,
is to check with the tour operator, cruise line, or resort as to
what they do or will do if a hurricane is in the area or should
strike while you are at a resort. And do get the information in
writing, as there probably are restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   It's nice to at least know what to expect for weather
conditions. While many weather patterns seem to be changing, having
a guide is still handy. Being released in October is Fodor's World
Weather Guide (Random House Reference &AMP; Information Publishing,
$17.95), which the publishers call ``the most thorough reference
tool for predicting climate anywhere on Earth.''

PLAYING CHICKEN WITH YOUR MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. JAFFE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, you probably feel like you are playing chicken with the
stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Your financial hopes, plans, and dreams have been speeding along
full-steam for years, but now the market is gaining on you and it's
driving in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   When the downturn started, it was far away. You barely saw it
coming. But Monday's 512-point loss in the Dow Jones industrial
average makes it look like a runaway train. You're on the tracks
and it's picking up speed.
</P>
<P>
   Here are your choices:
</P>
<P>
   _You can flinch, selling investments now and taking your savings
out of the path of the market downturn.
</P>
<P>
   _You can stay the course, figuring that the market has always
pulled off of previous downturns before crashing with your
portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   _You can hit the gas.
</P>
<P>
   There is no right answer, but this is a test _ of your will,
nerves, and the conviction you have in your financial plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people out there seem to be selling now and asking
questions later,'' says Thomas P. McIntire, president of Dessauer &AMP;
McIntire Asset Management Inc. in Orleans. ``In a market like this
one, it can be tough to stick with what you believe to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's 6.4 percent downturn pushed the index past all kinds of
psychological barriers, the kinds of things that make investors
freak out. The Dow had its second-biggest point drop ever, crossed
into negative territory for 1998, fell below 8000, and pushed its
loss since July 17 to nearly 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who have spent the 1990s ``buying on the dips'' aren't
quite so sure any more whether this is a ``dip.'' The saying ``sell
on strength'' suddenly rings true.
</P>
<P>
   Given that context _ and the fact that no one knows what will
happen next _ let's examine the three choices investors have now:
</P>
<P>
   _Flinch now and you avoid any crash that might be coming.
</P>
<P>
   Selling doesn't mean you avoid trouble. Unless it is done in a
tax-deferred account, you will owe taxes on any gains you realize _
which for long-term investors could be significant, despite the
recent decline.
</P>
<P>
   And then you have no idea when to buy back in. The stock market
typically rebounds quickly after it bottoms out. If you haven't
been prescient enough to get out before the current 20 percent
decline, you can't be sure to buy again before missing out on much
of the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't just sell, sell with some methodology about when you
will invest again,'' says Dan Sullivan, editor of The Chartist
Mutual Fund Timer newsletter in Seal Beach, Calif. ``Sell if you
have a reason to sell, not just because you're worried now that you
have waited out a decline this big.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers note that people who sell now to pursue safe havens in
money-market funds are not just timing the market, they are chasing
performance _ the very same thing most investors disdain during
good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is no different than someone chasing a hot fund, except
that in this case the hot fund is a money market,'' says Paul
Merriman, who runs the Merriman Funds. ``All of these long-term
investors who say they don't chase performance are being
hypocritical if they sell now.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts suggest that you flinch and sell if you have reached
financial goals and are protecting your gains, or if it helps to
rebalance a portfolio that got out of whack while the stock market
was rising.
</P>
<P>
   If you are selling just to avoid the downturns that could occur
tomorrow or in the coming weeks, have a reentry strategy. Envision
the conditions that would make you buy back in, such as the Dow
rising 5 percent or 10 percent in recovery.
</P>
<P>
   _Stay the course and ride it out.
</P>
<P>
   The coming week, month, or quarter won't be all that memorable
when you look back 20 years from now. The market always has
rebounded and there is no reason to expect that to change now.
</P>
<P>
   The current decline appears to be caused by news events, not by
a fundamental shift in the economy. Many of the factors that fueled
the good times _ low unemployment, reasonable interest rates,
positive earnings _ have not changed.
</P>
<P>
   What is different is investor sentiment, the collective emotions
of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Notes McIntire: ``None of the important stuff has really
changed. What has changed is how people feel about the market. If
you invested in stocks with good fundamentals, you know they will
come back. You just have to wait them out.''
</P>
<P>
   One compromise strategy that many investors seem to be turning
to involves keeping current monies in place, but directing all new
investments to money-market or bond offerings.
</P>
<P>
   _Stomp on the accelerator, because downturns are temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have described the market as overvalued for
months, if not years. The current decline presents some chances to
bargain hunt; at the least, it provides the opportunity to add to
your stock or fund holdings at a relative discount.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean going crazy and moving all of your savings
into mutual funds that specialize in Russian stocks and bonds. But
it does mean seizing the more conservative opportunities the market
offers now and holding on long enough to collect.
</P>
<P>
   There is an adage on Wall Street that corrections and bear
markets typically end when the last investor gives up, when
everybody who is going to sell actually goes ahead and does it.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, not everyone has sold out yet.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, however, that what everyone else does in this game of
chicken does not matter. It's what you do that will determine the
success of your financial future.

TEXAS SENATOR SAYS CLINTON SHOULD CONSIDER CALLING IT QUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ President Clinton should strongly consider
resigning after admitting he misled his wife, aides and the nation
about his affair with a White House intern, Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, R-Texas, said leaving office would be a courageous
act for Clinton, who acknowledged on Aug. 17 that he had had a
relationship with the former intern, Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president would have the integrity to resign I think
that it would be a very good first step into putting our policies
and our country back together,'' she said Monday. ``I think it
would be a courageous and good thing for him to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said she wasn't directly calling for the president's
resignation but thought he should seriously consider it.
</P>
<P>
   Her comments opened a new round of Republican criticism of
Clinton over his affair with Lewinsky, and followed calls by House
Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, for Congress to remain in session
until it can review an upcoming report from Whitewater independent
counsel Kenneth Starr, who is investigating Clinton's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is among 21 House members and four U.S. senators to call
for Clinton's resignation. Except for Rep. Paul McHale, D-Pa., all
the lawmakers calling for the president to step down are
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, on Monday described Clinton's affair
with Lewinsky as ``morally offensive.'' But he did not call for the
president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a member of the House Judiciary Committee, which would have
jurisdiction over any impeachment proceeding, I believe the
president continues to have a moral obligation to tell the American
people the rest of that story,'' Smith said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Neal, a spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm, said the Texas
Republican ``is determined to withhold comment until he's required
under the Constitution to act as a judge.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and his fellow senators would conduct a trial if the House
votes for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no indication that Clinton, who was in Moscow
Tuesday for a summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, would
resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is going to continue focusing his energies every
day on addressing the issues of real concern to the American
people,'' Jim Kennedy, a White House spokesman, said Monday.

RECALLING THE MANTRA OF BUFFETT, THE BUY AND HOLD GURU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren Buffett would be proud.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizard of Omaha has spent a lifetime preaching the wisdom of
long-term investing and there was little evidence Monday that his
flock had lost faith _ even in the face of a dramatic market
selloff that cut more than 500 points off the Dow Jones industrial
average.
</P>
<P>
   Time after time investors we talked with cited the teaching of
Buffett, whose buy-and-hold strategy has made him one of the most
revered _ and wealthiest _ investors in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Warren Buffett says, `If you don't want to own a stock for
10 years, you shouldn't own it a day,''' said Jonathan O'Reilly,
who at 24 is working his first job out of college as an auditor for
Arthur Anderson &AMP; Co. Added O'Reilly: ``I have plenty of time left.
This is just a blip in the road for a guy like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some blip.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meltdown, combined with a three-day loss of 550 points
at the end of last week, pushed the Dow into negative territory for
the first time this year. But the recent damage has been much, much
worse than that broad index implies. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index has lost 19 percent from its July 17 high and the Russell
2000 index, which measures small-company stocks, is down an
astounding 31 percent since its April 21 peak.
</P>
<P>
   One hallmark of this longest of all bull markets has been the
little guy, who over the last three years has propped up the market
each time it has threatened to buckle. We talked to dozens of small
investors Monday. The bottom line: People are more nervous than in
the past, but no one seems panicked. There's more talk of buying
than selling. Many are playing wait-and-see.
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, the brave young auditor, says he bought Grey Wolf
Inc., a beaten-up oil services company, two days ago and likes the
look of Dell Computer, which lost 18 3/4 Monday. Paul Mark, an
accountant, bought Compaq Computer and Analog Devices in the last
couple of weeks. Twenty-six-year-old Amy Banks, who with her
boyfriend started an investment club, ``In God We Trust,'' 18
months ago, says she may buy Compaq and National Semiconductor in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Said Banks: ``I believe strongly in Buffett's philosophy that
when the market is going down, that is your best time to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Elisabeth O'Brien, 32, a forsenic chemist, agrees. ``I've been
waiting for this,'' she says. ``I kept thinking this has got to go
down, got to go down and now it finally has. I haven't been in the
market and I'm looking for some opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so cheery.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Chase is 69 and retired. And he admits to being a bit
``overinvested'' at the moment, with most of his investments in 20
to 25 large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm losing my shirt,'' says Chase, a retired MIT and Raytheon
physicist. ``But about all I can do at this point is sit and watch
it and wince.''
</P>
<P>
   Many are like Henry Olds, a 61-year-old software engineer. Olds
says he, like others, expected a market correction, but has been
surprised by the severity. A week ago he thought about making some
changes in his portfolio, but when he looked over his stocks he
liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Take his bet on Boeing Co., which has been cut nearly in half
from its April top. The stock has gotten hammered by internal
problems and strong competition from Airbus, the European airplane
maker. But Olds is hanging on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally this is a very strong company,'' he says, ``that
will get its act together and still be the predominant player in
the field.''

   Most investors we talked with continue to believe the US economy
is strong. They worry about the crisis in Russia, Japan's banks,
and the prospects for Latin America. Russia, in particular, has
created a negative investing psychology, but that should not be
enough to derail the American economy, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia contributes absolutely nothing to the world economy,''
says Mark, the accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Some small business owners and executives are starting to worry
about what a slowdown in the economy and the market could do to
their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McManus, who started his management consulting and
training business 18 months ago, says he is considering whether to
sink some new marketing money into a Web site and new brochures or
continue as he is with cold calls. The market correction might have
tipped the scales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'd be inclined to keep costs as low as possible,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Roc O'Connell, chief operating officer of Festive Occasions in
Woburn, Mass., which rents equipment for corporate parties, is
watching, too. But so far he doesn't see a problem: ``If anything,
customers are spending like drunken sailors at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the party about over? Are we a bunch of drunken sailors about
to wake up to a painful hangover?
</P>
<P>
   Most investors said no Monday. At any rate, they said, the key
is the long term, just like Warren Buffett says.
</P>
<P>
   As one investor told us, ``I've read his book, several times.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem: Warren Buffett never wrote a book.
</P>
<P>
   Should we worry?

NO MORE HEAVY LIFTING FOR SKIP AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good thing for Skip Away that he'll never have to run in
a handicap race again. The big-hearted gray gave his last ounce of
energy lugging 131 pounds, a serious package, to a nose victory in
the $500,000 Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, the 3-year-old champion of 1996 and the handicap
champion of '97, now stands at 6 for 6 in his quest to become Horse
of the Year. There are three races remaining on Skip Away's
schedule: the $500,000 Woodward at Belmont Park Sept. 19, the
$750,000 Jockey Club Gold Cup, also at Belmont, Oct. 10, and the $4
million Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs Nov. 7. All are
weigh-for-age, meaning that Skip Away will carry scale weight
assigned all horses four years of age or older. Owner Carolyn Hine
and her husband, Sonny, who trains Skip Away, have made it clear
that they will retire him at the end of this season, in part
because the weight he would be asked to carry in handicaps next
year would be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iselin, Skip Away, off at 1-20 ($2.10 to win), gave 18
pounds to Stormin Fever, the 9-1 second choice, who rushed up
turing for home under Jose Santos to engage Skip Away and Jerry
Bailey from the outside. Stormin Fever stuck his nose in front
inside the eighth-pole, but Skip Away found another gear _ not an
easy task under such a heavy impost _ and outfinished his rival.
The time of 1:47 1/5 for the 1 1/8 miles was just two-fifths of a
second off the track record. It was 9 lengths back to the third
finisher, 25-1 shot Testafly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes time to accelerate carrying all that weight,'' said
Bailey. ``I could feel his surge under me, so I knew he was coming
back quicker than the rest of the people could see. I felt like we
were going to get him and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He carried 131 pounds and was only two ticks off the track
record,'' said Sonny Hine. ``If he carried 118 pounds, he would
have shattered the record. When that other horse came to him, I
wasn't worried. Skippy never gives up. You can't ask for more than
he gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   Stormin Fever, trained by Mark Hennig, had a nice record coming
into the Iselin (12-6-3-2), but most of his success had been at the
allowance level.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the eighth-pole, I thought I was home free,'' said Santos.
``Skip Away had to really show his class to come back and beat me.
I rode my horse like it was a Breeders' Cup race and he just never
gave up on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, whose career record is 35-17-10-5, raised his total
earnings to $9,206,360 in his pursuit of the North American mark of
$9,999,815 set by Cigar. Sonny Hine is convinced that if Skip Away
breaks Cigar's earnings record, he can't be denied the Horse of the
Year honor as he was last year, when it went to 2-year-old Favorite
Trick in a highly questionable vote.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The challengers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two leading candidates to overtake Skip Away for the top
Eclipse Award are Free House and Awesome Again, and each may face
Skip Away before the Breeders' Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Free House, 2 for 2 on the season, including a convincing score
in the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar Aug. 10, is expected
to come to New York for the Woodward. Awesome Again, who looked
awesome taking the $300,000 Saratoga Breeders' Cup Sunday to run
his record on the year to 4 for 4, might go to the Big Apple for
the Jockey Club Gold Cup. It may be the feeling of their camps that
they must defeat Skip Away twice _ once in New York and again in
the Breeders' Cup _ to overtake him in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   While Skip Away struggled, Awesome Again just whistled, and his
trainer, Pat Byrne, is extremely high on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very pleased with performance he gave and I couldn't
have asked for more,'' said Byrne. ``The Breeders' Cup Classic is
definitely in mind and that's what we're shooting for. His next
start is either going to be the Jockey Club Gold Cup or the
Hawthorne Gold Cup ($400,000, run the same day as the Jockey Club).
We'd like to get him to the Classic undefeated for the year.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Trick' no treat
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Favorite Trick was the disappointment of the weekend at
Saratoga, finishing fifth as the 6-5 choice in the $200,000 King's
Bishop, a sprint stake on the Travers undercard. His connections
had better get him on the turf fast, before his already tarnished
reputation losses any more luster. ``Coming off the long races, he
may have lost some early kick,'' said trainer Bill Mott. ``It
looked like he started to make a good run, it appeared there was a
time when a hole opened up, but someone else was quicker and he had
nowhere to go. We've toyed withe idea of running him on the turf at
some point.'' ... Silver Charm worked a mile in 1:37 3/5 at Del Mar
Sunday, going through 5 furlongs in :59 and 6 furlongs in 1:12 2/5
on the way to his final clocking under Chris McCarron. Trainer Bob
Baffert still has not set a schedule for his once formidable
charge, who has lost his last two starts ... Gentlemen, who
finished second to Free House in the Pacific Classic, worked a half
in :47 3/5 at Del Mar Friday and also may come to the Woodward.
``He's doing well,'' said his trainer, Richard Mandella. ``We're
looking at the Woodward or the Woodbine Mile (run on the grass
Sept. 20) for him. We don't have any Breeders' Cup plans at the
moment, but that doesn't mean we wouldn't consider it.'' Puerto
Madero, Gentlemen's stablemate, who ran second behind Skip Away in
both the Massachusetts Handicap and the Hollywood Gold Cup, is out
for the season with a bad back.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Rockin' good start
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Ender Jimenez, who recently arrived at Rockingham from
Florida, is off to a hot start with five winners in four days.
Jimenez had one tally Friday, one Saturday, two Sunday (including
10th-race long shot Winning Tune, who paid $166), and one Monday.
Jimenez will ride at Suffolk after Rock closes Sept. 20 ... Paula
Bacon, who has won more than 400 races, also has switched her tack
to Rock. Bacon, who has been outstanding in the Midwest, came in
from Canterbury Park to ride first call for D&AMP;H Stable and trainer
William Downing. When racing at the Rock concludes, she'll move on
to the Meadowlands ... Rock will offer nine NFL games in the
Winner's Circle Lounge, keeping racing fans up on the action
Sundays and Monday nights. The track will hold raffles for free
football merchandise during Patriots games, and anyone can register
to win a free Super Bowl party for 50.

CONSUMER RESPONSE TO MARKET CRISIS A CRUCIAL UNKNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ So, how much poorer do you feel?
</P>
<P>
   For economists and government policy - makers, that question
becomes crucial after Monday's 512-point collapse in the Dow Jones
industrial average. One much-debated economic theory holds that a
rising stock market makes people feel wealthy, prompting them to
spend money and spur the overall economy.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the same theory says a falling stock market makes
people feel poor, prompting them to close their wallets. Because
consumers stimulate most of the nation's economic activity, a
falling stock market theoretically could make consumers stop
spending money to such a degree that the economy falters and
recession sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Economists call this ``the wealth effect.'' To them, we will all
now become guinea pigs in a real-world test of the strength of the
wealth effect, and of whether stock market ups and downs have a
significant impact on consumer spending and the broader economy.
</P>
<P>
   One outcome could be that consumer spending truly slows, and the
Federal Reserve reponds by cutting interest rates. Several
economists said Monday the diving Dow has made a rate cut likely.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists believe that some kind of wealth effect links
consumer behavior to stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kimelman, chief economist with Technical Data in Boston,
said the wealth effect has one particularly unwelcome feature: Its
impact is greatest when stock values are on their way down. For
every one dollar a consumer gains in a stock portfolio, she said,
that consumer will spend 5 cents extra on cars, housing, or
whatnot. But for every dollar a portfolio declines, she said, that
consumer will avoid parting with 8 cents that he or she would
otherwise have spent.
</P>
<P>
   Economist Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, on the
other hand, said the impact of the wealth effect has been
overstated. Most stock is owned by people who are already wealthy
and would spend money anyway, he said, and much of the rest is held
by people saving for the long-term goal of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Market drops like the one Monday ``don't have much to do with
the average American's consumption decisions,'' Bosworth said.
``This is like the 1987 stock crash, where people said, `Oh, this
will have an effect on consumption.' But you can look at the data,
and consumption actually boomed a few months later.''
</P>
<P>
   James Poterba, an economics professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, published a paper on the wealth effect in
1995 and has studied data through the first part of this year. His
conclusion: The wealth effect is commonly overstated. Rather than a
5-cent boost in consumer spending, he concluded, each new dollar of
stock market wealth prompts people to spend only one or two
additional cents.
</P>
<P>
   But Poterba offered two important caveats. The first is that the
wealth effect, if magnified by major swings in stock market value,
can still be significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the stock market falls by something like 10 percent, that
amounts to $1.2 trillion dollars of wealth in the US economy
evaporating,'' he said. ``If you think 2 percent of that would have
been spent in the current year, that turns into $24 billion not
spent. That's substantial. That's a noticeable effect in the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Kimelman's estimate of a 5-cent effect for every dollar in
wealth, which Poterba said is commonly found in economic textbooks,
would imply that a 10 percent stock decline inspires consumers to
hold back on $60 billion in spending.
</P>
<P>
   The second caveat is that Poterba considers the wealth effect in
its strict sense: the extent to which rises and declines in a
person's stock portfolio prompt that person to spend money. That is
a narrower question than whether swings in the stock market make
consumers feel secure or fearful about their futures, cautious or
carefree, and in turn prompt them to spend or save money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a broader psychological question _ the stock market as
a leading indicator that people use to gauge how they feel,''
Poterba said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The psychological effects are very important, and I don't
think we know as much about them,'' he said. The current downturn,
he added, will create ``an experiment'' that should help economists
study the question.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses as well as consumers are affected by stock market
swings, noted Nicholas Perna, chief economist with Fleet Financial
Group. ``This is not an environment where you make robust spending
plans,'' he said. ``I'll bet there are CEOs putting together a list
right now of what projects they might have to cancel or postpone.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists were divided on whether Monday's stock market drop
would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is ``seriously considering easing rates, and I think
they should,'' Kimelman said.
</P>
<P>
   Lower interest rates make it easier for people to borrow money
to buy homes, cars, and other items, and it allows businesses to
build and expand. The Fed will want to spur those activities to
counter any economic slowdown created by the wealth effect,
Kimelman said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, the Fed will try to bring stability to
turbulent global financial markets. Investors abroad these days are
selling currencies from Indonesia to Canada and buying US dollars.
A cut in interest rates by the Fed will make it easier to obtain US
dollars, which might deter panics in banks and markets overseas,
Kimelman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Allan Meltzer, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, said an interest-rate cut would be ``a
serious mistake'' because the domestic economy remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   Meltzer, who heads a Fed-watching group of economists called the
Shadow Open Market Committee, also noted that the Fed's charge from
Congress is to maintain a stable economy with high employment and
low inflation _ not to boost the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow had reached only the 6400 mark when Alan Greenspan, the
Fed chairman, made his famous suggestion in December 1996 that
stock prices were being driven to new highs by mere ``irrational
exuberance'' on the part of investors. Investors brushed off
Greenspan's warning, and stocks climbed to a record level above
9330 this July.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists wondered Monday whether a Fed chairman who
warned of irrationally high stock values at 6400 would cut rates
when the Dow industrials were still far above that mark at 7539.07,
their closing price Monday.

FUND AGENTS FIRM SCRAMBLE TO REASSURE NERVOUS INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the market slipped into a free fall late Monday
afternoon, calls jammed the computer-controlled telephone
switchboard at Scudder Investment Services in downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   A computer chart plotting the number of incoming calls climbed
to nearly 500, and ``information representatives'' at cubicle
workstations worked in a dull roar, speaking urgently into
telephone headsets, some of them pacing like leashed dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The main job of the reps: to soothe the frazzled nerves of
frantic investors and try to persuade them not to dump their
investments in a panic. ``At times like this, people's confidence
is shaken,'' said Nick Norton, the vice president who oversees call
center operations for Scudder funds. ``Usually people know
everything is OK. They just need some reassurance or a little
hand-holding.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not everyone who called Monday was nervous. Many simply
wanted to touch base, Scudder officials said. And more than a few
put money into income and growth funds to take advantage of what
some perceived as a buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say people are yawning, but most seem to
realize that the market is going to bounce back,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were enough frantic inquiries to place Scudder's
five nationwide call centers in ``escalation,'' an emergency
condition during which extraneous activities such as training are
postponed and all available employees are summoned to take calls.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of investors were rattled enough by Monday's plunge
to try to redeem their shares and get out of the market altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to redeem,'' said David Craig, a
representative in Scudder's high-end customer unit. ``I don't let
them if I can possibly help it.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he received a call less than a minute before the
market closed from an ``elderly gentleman'' who had substantial
amounts of money in stock growth funds. ``He was, like, ready to
get rid of it all,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Frantically punching numbers into a calculator, Craig convinced
the man to transfer money to other, more conservative investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got him to keep all his money at Scudder,'' he said,
stripping the telephone headset and tossing it on his desk. ``We
didn't lose any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the huge volume of calls and the large numbers of people
who seemed on the verge of panic Monday, few actually cashed out,
Scudder officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That, in part, is a testament to the people who take the calls,
who are armed with ``talking points'' about financial news of the
day and trained to reason investors out of bad decisions, Scudder
officials said. ``Usually when people call, they know they're not
ready to redeem,'' said Diane Carrow, an investor information
representative. ``Most of the time, we're just there to remind them
of that.''

<P>
   BOSTON _ Rumors of a comeback by former Bruins star Cam Neely
began swirling a week ago, causing Neely's phone to ring off the
hook, but the situation actually began innocently a few weeks ago
when Neely noticed something different about himself. After two
years of retirement from hockey, Neely had a little extra weight
around his waist. Not a lot, but enough that it bothered him. At
33, and a couple months away from being a first-time father, Neely
decided to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point where my pants started getting a little
tighter around the waist and I thought, `The joke's over,''' said
Neely, who was working out at Boston University Monday. ``On my own
I started doing some stuff at the house on some equipment I have
there. I couldn't do a lot. I wasn't sure what I could do because
of my hip.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely's ailing right hip, which had forced him to retire, had to
be treated with caution, so Neely called conditioning coach Mike
Boyle, who had helped him through knee and thigh injuries during
his career. In turn, Boyle introduced Neely to Wellesley physical
therapist Dan Dyrek, whose work has made a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Neely's goals were to improve his overall health and
his hip in particular so he could put off or even avoid a hip
replacement. But in a short time, Neely felt well enough to allow
himself to flirt with the what-ifs regarding a resumption of his
hockey career. While that certainly is a long shot, Neely said he
is just enjoying feeling better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it is just getting healthier,'' he said.
``If other things lead to something else, that would be great. It'd
be more than great. If the worst thing that happens to me is I get
healthier and I prolong or avoid a hip replacement, then I'm a
happy person.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely hasn't been on ice skates in a long time and said he isn't
tempted to try it just yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really my primary focus right now,'' he said. ``I
just want to feel better for day-to-day things. If things go well
and the hip allows me to progress to the point where I say, `Let's
see how it feels on the ice,' I certainly would be a fool not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does bother me, and that's what I am trying to get to _ the
point where I can alleviate that. It has improved, there's no
question. Hopefully it will improve a lot more but there are still
days when I feel it _ almost every day still, but not nearly as bad
as it was. Some days it doesn't bother me. It all depends on what
I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   At midsummer, Neely went rollerblading around the Charles River
with some friends and felt the same competitive spirit that he
always felt when he donned hockey skates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got on the skates, I couldn't just casually stroll
around,'' he said. ``I did some wind sprints to see how I would
feel and how the hip would respond the next day or even later that
day. It felt fine, but rollerblading isn't playing professional
hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely enjoys married life and is looking forward to becoming a
parent, but retirement has been far tougher than he anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very difficult transition,'' he said. ``I haven't
really been wanting to say, `I'm going to enjoy this.' Probably
that's been a fault. I didn't say, `OK, that part of my life is
over. Let me just enjoy not doing anything for a while and spend
some time with my wife and do some things.' Instead, I was really
concerned about finding something else to do. I was putting a lot
of pressure on myself. I'm very fortunate where I was in the
position where I didn't have to rush into anything but I was trying
to force myself into something and that made it worse. That made it
much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Neely has had job offers, most recently to become an assistant
coach with the New York Islanders, but he turned them down. He felt
the timing just wasn't right and he isn't sure that's the right
career path for him anyway. He's concerned about the lack of
security and isn't sure that his ultimate goal is to be a head
coach. Right now, he's content to take his time and see what
happens with his workouts.Monday
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my head is in a better place right now,'' he said.
``I'm just taking things as they come and not worrying about what
I'm going to do. I can't expect to find something I'm as passionate
about as I was with hockey. I've kind of put that aside. I'm
thinking, `You might not find something you absolutely love like
you did with your last job,' so if I can find something I like,
that'd be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   While Neely would love to be able to return to the Bruins, his
goals are modest right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thrilled with the idea of a hip replacement down the
road,'' said Neely. ``Dan said he could improve my hip. To what
degree, it's kind of unknown. He told me if I don't do anything,
I'd need a hip replacement sooner rather than later. I thought I'd
be a fool not to try to improve my health. I'm actually excited
about it. I look forward to working out and getting back into
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really made a promise to myself that I wouldn't be a fat
ex-athlete. We're all in such great shape for our whole careers.
It's a shame to let it go. It's all mental. Everybody works out not
necessarily because they love to come in here and get beaten up.
You have to for your job, it's a commitment. When I retired, I said
I was going to keep working out but when you don't have to for a
job, it's like, `I'll do it tomorrow.' Next thing you know, a year
goes by and you haven't done a whole hell of a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it seems like old times. Neely is back in the gym, reunited
with fitness guru Boyle, and excited about where it might take him.
After two years of not being asked about his health every day,
Neely said it's a little ironic to be pursued again by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of strange to be back in this situation,'' he said.
``First and foremost, I was trying to get healthy. To have the
reaction I did was a little overwhelming. The phone has been
ringing off the hook. People I know socially but don't talk to
every day, no matter where I went, were asking me about it. People
were wishing me good luck. It was really quite a nice reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some people he hasn't yet talked to: the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they understand what my situation is, quite
thoroughly,'' said Neely, a wide grin spreading across his face.
``I'm sure they'll be the first to know if things change
dramatically.''

MIXING IT UP ON LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An underrated pair of dueling analysts is working on Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   During Game 1 of the WNBA championship series, former WNBA
player Fran Harris and WNBA coach Mary Murphy took opposite
positions on a variety of topics. Their disagreements were civil
but strong.
</P>
<P>
   Their most heated exchange involved the possibility of the WNBA
players establishing a union.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the time is right,'' Murphy said. ``There has
been so much discussion about this and talk about coming up for a
vote next year. But we're only in our second year as a league, the
ABL just folded a franchise. We've had some attendance problems
with some of our franchises. TV ratings aren't where we want them
to be. To me, the time just is not right there. We've got to get
some credibility going first.''
</P>
<P>
   Not according to Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking at it from a player's perspective, you've
got to get some things in place, like health care, some equity with
the players' salaries,'' she said. ``You've got some players making
a quarter of a million, and then some at the bottom making only
$10,000. I think that needs to be addressed now.''
</P>
<P>
   If only Don Criqui and Jerry Glanville, the erstwhile Patriots
preseason announcers, could be as smart.
</P>
<P>
   Or as interesting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lots of games on tap
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ESPN's ``Game-Day'' travels to South Bend to preview the Notre
Dame-Michigan game. ESPN and ESPN2 also have lots of games this
week, starting Thursday night on ESPN at 8 with Virginia-Auburn and
on ESPN that night at 11 with Arizona-Hawaii. Saturday at noon,
ESPN has Tennessee at Syracuse, followed by BYU at Alabama at 7 and
Colorado at Colorado State at 10. ESPN2 has Wake Forest-Air Force
at 1 p.m. and Vanderbilt-Mississippi State at 6 ... Sunday Verne
Lundquist and Randy Cross call Pittsburgh-Baltimore at 1, followed
by Greg Gumbel and Phil Simms doing the Jets at San Francisco. Fox
has Detroit at Green Bay at 1, with Dick Stockton and Matt Millen.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
No. 2 tries harder
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball might be a little upset about its Sunday
night games being switched to ESPN2 to make way for football on
ESPN. But the Deuce is nothing to be ashamed about. In five years,
ESPN2 has grown from 10 million subscribers to 60 million, the
fastest any network has reached that number, according to Nielsen.
ESPN2 grew faster than TNT (63 months), the Learning Channel (72
months), CNBC (91 months), and 16 other networks that have crossed
the 60 million mark, according to a statement by ESPN2 ... ESPN
Classic Sports has a bunch of winners this week. Wednesday
``History of the AFL'' airs at 8:30 p.m. On Thursday night at 7:30,
Dick Schaap interviews the one and only Art Donovan. On Friday, the
1989 Michigan-Notre Dame game airs at 8 p.m. And on Sunday, there
is a two-hour special on Dr. J and the ABA at 9 p.m. ... Fox Sports
Net has extended its television deal with the Big 12 through
2006-07, the Associated Press reported. The Big 12 told AP that the
new contract is worth 80 percent more than the previous deal, which
went for $120 million and would have expired after the 1999-2000
academic year. Fox Sports Net reaches 60 million homes through 22
regional sports networks and also has deals with Pac-10 football
and basketball and Conference USA football. The Big 12 deal calls
for Fox Sports Net to expand its coverage of women's basketball,
women's volleyball, women's gymnastics, wrestling, baseball, and
track and field.

MILKING A TRANSFER FOR ALL IT'S WORTH

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What has Christian Vieri's record $38 million transfer from
Atletico Madrid to Lazio got to do with the price of cappuccino?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a lot, according to Lazio's rival fans in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   A group of bartenders issued the statement: ``We will never use
Cragnotti's milk, we don't want to pay Lazio's players,'' referring
to Lazio president Sergio Cragnotti, who heads the Cirio food
group.
</P>
<P>
   But Cragnotti defended the price increase of dairy products,
telling Corriere dello Sport: ``It's ridiculous, I don't have to
sell cappuccini to reinforce Lazio. This is a function of the
market and stabilizing prices. These are two separate entities, and
whoever thinks there is a mixing of funds between the business and
the team doesn't know anything about the rules clubs have to follow
when they are quoted on the stock exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   With Vieri and Chilean Marcelo Salas, Lazio now has a formidable
strike force, added to Alen Boksic, Roberto Mancini, Pavel Nedved,
plus new acquisitions Ivan de la Pena and Sergio Conceicao. Lazio
defeated Juventus, 1-0, for the Italian Super Cup without Vieri.

Team turnover
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Germany should be among the more interesting teams in
preparation for Euro 2000 qualifying. The Germans will be younger
(average age 25.6 years) than they were in the World Cup (average
age 29.7) and they will also be less Teutonic.
</P>
<P>
   The newcomers include Fenerbahce's Mustafa Dogan, born in
Germany of Turkish parents; a Swiss player, Oliver Neuvile of Hansa
Rostock, whose father was born in Aachen; and Paulo Rink, a
Brazilian who joined Bayer Leverkusen last year. Rink has a dual
passport since it was discovered his great grandfather emigrated
from Heidelbrg in 1908.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be caution with these naturalizations,'' striker
Oliver Bierhoff said. ``To place players on the national team who
have only arrived here for a year doesn't seem ideal to me. The
people want to identify with the team, and the patriotic sentiment
will prevail in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Back to real world
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   France's World Cup championship fete moved to Marseilles, as the
city invited members and former members of Olympique Marseilles to
a spirited celebration that included a parade Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But the players have mostly returned to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Marcel Desailly, who has had a slow start for Chelsea, will miss
Saturday's Euro 2000 qualifying opener against Iceland in Reykjavik
after being ejected against Brazil in Saint-Denis.
</P>
<P>
   Emmanuel Petit was ejected as Arsenal was held to a 0-0 tie by
Charlton, and will miss the Gunners' next game, against Chelsea.
That means the Highbury fans will have to silence their chant:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's blond, he's quick, his name's a porno flick, Emmanuel,
Emmanuel.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Still with Revolution
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution acquired 12 foreign players during Thomas
Rongen's reign, and only Walter Zenga had a significant effect on
the team's record. The Revolution won 11 matches in regulation time
with Zenga on the field; they have won only 15 matches without him.
</P>
<P>
   But at least some of the former players are hoping for the best
for the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel pain for the Revolution when they lose,'' said
Francis Okaroh, the team's best defender in 1996 and '97 before
being lost to Chicago in the expansion draft. ``When they lost to
Los Angeles (5-1), everyone was making fun of me, even though I am
not with the team anymore. But I felt like that was my team being
humiliated on national television.''
</P>
<P>
   Rongen failed to replace Okaroh in central defense, a
significant factor in the team's demise this season. Okaroh, who
has resided in Boston since 1981 and last year attained US
citizenship, said he would be willing to return to the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt good about what happened,'' Okaroh said.
``Whatever was done wasn't right for the team. In my opinion, some
of the moves that were made were not made for benefit of team, and
in my situation, I never had a real explanation. Sometimes when
that happens, it's a quality issue, but I think it was a personal
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been able to help the young players in Chicago, such as
C.J. Brown, and that is what I wanted to do with Brian Dunseth. If
they can work something out, I would come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Naveda also expressed interest in returning to the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss the team and I miss Boston, and I would love to come
back,'' said Naveda, who has signed with Maccabi Ironi Ashdod in
Israel. ``Zenga knows a lot about the game and I think and hope he
will be a good coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said this would happen with Thomas many months ago. He was a
complete mistake as a coach because he made the players afraid to
play. He blames the players, the foreign players first. He wants
players he can manage and do whatever he wants to with, who he can
say anything to. He wants players who won't say anything, like they
are in college. You have to have discipline, sure, but not that
way.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Listen to doctors, trainers and athletes, and
you'll hear the same buzz: everybody is talking about ``andro,''
the nutritional supplement made famous by recent revelations that
St. Louis Cardinals' slugger Mark McGwire uses it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been buying it like crazy,'' said Michael Donlick,
the head trainer at World Gym in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. ``I'm
constantly getting questions about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Known officially as androstenedione, it's touted as a way to
improve athletic performance, enhance libido and boost levels of
testosterone, the hormone linked to strength and muscle mass.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it has been described as a natural alternative to
anabolic steroids, a wide class of drugs that have long been
prohibited in the athletic world because they give an unfair edge
to users. Remember Ben Johnson, the fallen star of Canadian track
and field? But andro, unlike its taboo chemical cousins, doesn't
require a prescription and is available in many health food stores
and gyms.
</P>
<P>
   Although banned by the National Football League and
International Olympic Committee, it is still legal in major-league
baseball. A month's supply of pills costs between $25 and $50.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it? Dr. Bruce H. Dick, an orthopedic surgeon and
specialist in sports medicine at Albany Medical Center who served
as medical director for the women's 1996 Olympic Field Hockey team,
doesn't think so.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, andro, like all nutritional supplements, isn't
controlled by the Food and Drug Administration, so there's no
reliable way to determine quality, purity or efficacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's cause for concern just because you don't know
what you're taking,'' Dick said.
</P>
<P>
   Andro, a natural hormone found in animals and some plants, also
doesn't act like most nutritional supplements. Rather than deliver
a finished mineral or vitamin into the body, andro serves as fuel
for testosterone production. No one knows its long-term effects on
that process.
</P>
<P>
   We do know from experience with anabolic steroids that having
too much testosterone in the body can be harmful and may cause male
pattern baldness, unnatural hair growth in women, changes to sex
organs and mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the FDA has found no cause for concern: ``At this
point, we don't have sufficient information that androstenedione is
a threat to public health,'' an FDA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't so certain. General Nutrition Companies, one of
the largest national retailers of vitamins and other health aids,
has yet to start selling it.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Boehning, who stocks the supplement shelves at the
independently-owned Honest Weight Food Coop in Albany, also is
wary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in messing with hormones,'' she said. ``I'm
very cautious with stuff that upsets or disrupts such a delicate
system.''

   RUSSIA-CLINTON _ MOSCOW _ President Clinton urged Russians
Tuesday to ``reject the failed policies of the past'' in coping
with their current economic crisis. ``Given the facts before you .
. . I do not believe there are any painless solutions,'' Clinton
told a new generation of Russian leaders at Moscow State University
of International Relations. He repeatedly said that Russia must
``play by the rules'' of international commerce. Clinton met
earlier with Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the first session
of a two-day summit unlikely to deliver sweeping agreements from
the politically wounded presidents. Despite the poor outlook,
Yeltsin declared just before meeting with Clinton that
``Russian-American relations are developing successfully.'' He
greeted Clinton with a bear hug and handshake in the Kremlin's
presidential study. Wrap will also discuss Monica Lewinsky and U.S.
stock market. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   RUSSIA-POLITICS _ MOSCOW _ Amid a crisis threatening to derail
this country's political system, President Clinton sets out
Wednesday to transform this Russia summit from a meeting with the
politically mangled Boris Yeltsin to talks with a host of his
possible successors. Yeltsin promised to stick with Prime
Minister-designate Viktor Chernomirdyn as the State Duma scheduled
a second vote on his nomination for Friday -- promising that he
will gain be defeated. (Holmes, Cox News Service).

   WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ECONOMY _ WASHINGTON The summer sell-off that washed out
the year's gains on Wall Street poses an untimely threat to
President Clinton, whose high job performance ratings have
weathered the Monica Lewinsky scandal largely by virtue of a strong
economy. Slumping polls pegged to falling markets would be
particularly bad news for Clinton now, with the Republican Congress
ready to return next week to consider possible impeachment
proceedings, and a report by independent counsel Kenneth Starr due
out later this month. (Deans, Cox News Service 800).
</P>
<P>
   MARKET-IMPACT _ WASHINGTON _ Sharp fluctuations in the stock
market can have a major impact on government policies, and
policymakers in Washington will be watching Wall Street today with
a wary eye. For example, Congressional Budget Office estimates of a
surplus in the federal budget were based in part on an assumption
that there would be an average 10 percent annual growth in the Dow
Jones Index. But with stocks dropping like rocks this past week,
those estimates may need to be revised. (Dart, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   SWEEPSTAKES _ WASHINGTON _ ``Congratulations. You have just won
a million dollars.'' Millions of Americans have found this message
glaring at them in bold type in the mailbox and some really believe
it. Many senior citizens have spent thousands of dollars buying
magazines they don't need and even flying to other cities to pick
up the non-existent prize. Hundreds have tried to deposit in the
bank contest entries that look like cashier's checks. To protect
senior citizens from the misleading mail, Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo., has introduced legislation that would regulate
direct-mail sweepstakes. A Senate Governmental Affairs subcommittee
holds a hearing on the issue Tuesday. Also testifying will be
Robert Butterworth, Florida's attorney general. (Lipman, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-SENATE _ One is a baseball hall of famer. The other is a
basketball legend from the University of Kentucky. Together Reps.
Jim Bunning (R-Ky.) and Scotty Baesler (D-Ky.) are mixing it up in
one of the nation's closest U.S. Senate contests. Both are vying to
replace retiring Sen. Wendell Ford (D-Ky.) The second in our series
on Southern Senate races. (Foskett, Cox News Service).

   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-POLL _ Texas Poll shows Republicans leading in all major
statewide races, except attorney general. Ex-AG Mattox has 48-29
lead over Republican John Cornyn. (Herman, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   GATOR-HUNT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At a half-hour before
sunset, some of the 680 men and women with permits for this year's
state alligator hunt set out with harpoons and bang sticks to bag
as many as five gators apiece. It's illegal to use rifles or
pistols to hunt the reptiles, so many hunters use hooked baits,
harpoons or arrows with lines attached to bring the gators to the
boat, said state biologist Lindsey Hord. Once the animals are
captured, hunters usually use a bang stick to kill them, Hord said.

   Haunted by the assassination of his older brother Jamie 12 years
before during the California primary, the very charismatic Kerry
blunders while making a statement on abortion rights, just after
Sean Burke, a right-to-lifer, kills two people at a Boston abortion
clinic. Burke then flies to San Francisco and volunteers at
Kilcannon's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a reporter learns that the married Kilcannon had an
affair with Lara Costello, a reporter who covered him, and that
Costello aborted their child.
</P>
<P>
   In flashbacks, we learn that Kilcannon's policeman father drank
and beat his wife. As a lad, Kerry was small, a poor student and
was always picking fights with the bigger boys until Newark, N.J.,
pol Liam Nunn befriends him. Nevertheless, he never has lost ``his
self-image as the less gifted younger brother of a brilliant but
distant'' older brother. Eventually, Kerry goes to law school and
gets a job in the Newark district attorney's office prosecuting
crimes of domestic violence. Kerry meets Meg Collins, a divorced
schoolteacher whom he marries. A fellow attorney, Clayton Slade,
becomes his best friend and when Jamie is killed, runs Kerry's
campaign for Jamie's Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson deftly moves back and forth between the past and
present, carefully showing how Kerry has become the man he is _ an
honest politician who really cares for the people, yet who is also
willing to lie if Lara's abortion becomes public knowledge. You
have to think Robert Kennedy in many scenes, Bill Clinton in some.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Safe Passage'' explores the price politicians pay for their
ambition and their sins.
</P>
<P>
   Well-paced and well-written with strong character development
and smart political insight, Patterson's latest is destined to be a
bestseller.

   ``82 Desire.'' By Julie Smith. Fawcett Columbine. $24. 309
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's eighth mystery featuring New Orleans Police Detective
Skip Langdon is a witty and charming addition to the series.
</P>
<P>
   Langdon is assigned to investigate the disappearance of Russell
Fortier, a Union Oil Co. executive and the husband of Councilwoman
Bebe Fortier. Talba Wallis is moonlighting for a private
investigator, using her computer skills to get a temp job at Union
Oil so she can hack into Fortier's files. When the P.I. turns up
dead and the computer disc she gave him is missing, Wallis knows
she's in big trouble. Meanwhile, someone is feeding Times-Picayune
reporter Jane Storey tips on the missing Fortier.
</P>
<P>
   When Langdon and Storey show up at one of Wallis' poetry
readings, both are convinced they are being manipulated big time.
Behind Fortier's disappearance is a web of corporate greed that
ends in more murders.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's strengths are her incredible and sometimes outrageous
characters and her snappy dialogue. To read Wallis' poem (Page 59)
on how her mother named her Urethra is worth the price of the book.
Obviously, she has had her named changed. Very funny stuff.

MAGNET CURE-ALLS: THEIR FORCE IS WITH USZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JON HAHN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The real problem isn't global warming, holes in the ozone layer
or toxic waste. The real problem is polarity.
</P>
<P>
   The natural order of things, particularly polarity, is being
disrupted by alternative-medicine health freaks using too many
over-the-counter magnetic cure-alls.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many magnets loose out there in the free world that
they are disrupting electronically controlled airline flights,
reruns of ``Gilligan's Island'' and vast corporate telephone
voice-mail programs that promise us our calls are important to
them.
</P>
<P>
   As you no doubt remember from eighth-grade science class,
magnetism is one of the basic forces of nature, along with heat,
light and sex. The lattermost force is a good example of magnetism,
also referred to in some song lyrics as ``that ol' black magnet,''
in which eighth-grade boys spend most of the science period ogling
eighth-grade girls.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, this is animal magnetism, where opposites
attract. That is, girls attract boys. That is because girls at
about eighth grade begin developing extremely large . . . magnetic
fields, and boys have cast-iron brains unable to fend off the
powerful Girl, or G-rays beamed at them by girls pretending not to
differentiate them from a hole in the ground. If you were paying
attention to those old ``Flash Gordon'' serials on Saturday
afternoons, this is basically the same as Emperor Ming and Queen
Azura's powerful ray cannon aimed at New Jersey while Flash and his
girlfriend, Dale Whatzername, were doing magnetism experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, and sometimes not at all, boys grow to men and are
able to deal with female magnetism. Mostly, by taking cold showers
or going bowling or playing softball or basketball with other old
guys. This leads to deterioration of their male magnetic fields,
which no longer extend as forcefully as they did when they were in
eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   Which is where Viagra, aspirin, DMSO, ibuprofen and magnets come
into play, so to speak. Discounting for a moment the first item,
the others generally deal with PAIN, a medical acronym for Polar
Asymmetric Internal Nexus, a term often used by Flash Gordon's
scientist friend to confuse eighth-grade boys. But the thrust of
this whole painful magnetism thing is what the Dr. Leonard's
catalog advertising copy says is ``magnetic therapy ... used for
centuries ... to help enhance circulation, reduce swelling, and
ease stiffness and pain.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el1l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Claiming to be ``America's Leading Discount Healthcare
Catalog,'' the most recent 56-page publication's front page
advertisement (``As Seen on TV'') for ``Sobakawa Magnetic Insoles''
says
</P>
<P>
   you can ``walk your way to wellness.'' That is because the
insoles contain ``strategically placed Bioflex concentric magnets''
in a cushioned foam base.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog also offers a complete magnetic healing system,
magnetic neck pillow, copper and magnetic insoles, magnetic
designer watches (I assume it's the watch band, not the designer),
magnetic car seat cushions, magnetic shoulder pads, copper and
magnetic designer jewelry, magnetic bracelets, deluxe magnetic knee
brace, magnetic bandages, magnetic ring and bracelet set, magnetic
back brace, magnetic mattress and pillow pad, magnetic cervical
collar, flexible magnets and those nifty little rotary clippers for
safely and easily removing embarrassing nose and ear hairs.
</P>
<P>
   Taken in total, or even topically, and extrapolated by the
millions of customers walking, skipping and running around out
there with the aid of their magnetic insoles, we are talking about
one helluva magnetic force field exacerbation, which is the kind of
language your physician uses when he learns you've sent your money
to Dr. Leonard's instead of his OlympicGreen Physicians Inc.
billing department.
</P>
<P>
   All these magnets worn by people, under their clothes and in
their shoes, make the waves in Earth's normal magnetic fields waver
and do silly things, like when you put two boy magnets or two girl
magnets together. As with all medicines and touchy issues, you
should consult your physician and your mother before going there.
</P>
<P>
   The overall effect of all these magnets not only has set off
airport security alarms, but caused embarrassing in-flight
situations when passengers with opposite-polarity magnetic braces
sit close to one another. A Seattle-based designer coffee sales
executive and a woman self-defense instructor reportedly had to be
separated with a Lionel train transformer after they became stuck
together on a flight over Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   So you can see, it's very important to pay attention in
eighth-grade science class because in this great land of ours,
anyone could grow up to be president and still, somehow, fail to
recognize the powerful influences of magnetism.

FUTURE HOTELS AIM TO PLEASE EVERYONE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ You exit the elevator, stride down a hallway and
fumble for the keys to your hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Oops, no more keys. Instead, you swipe a credit card through a
slot at the door. Or place your hand on an electronic wallboard
that recognizes the imprint you provided when you registered. It
may even recognize retinal patterns in your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   You step inside and are immediately at ease with the color
scheme and room configuration. The decor matches preferences
detailed on a personal data form you provided the hotel in advance
of your visit.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to work out after an exhausting business meeting? Jogging
shoes and exercise clothing are in the closet, sized according to
your requests.
</P>
<P>
   Stressed out? Push a button on the wall and unwind to the
soothing sounds of gently falling rain in the background. Push
another and reduce the lighting to a faint glow. Or activate a
virtual reality entertainment center, don a headset and stretch out
on a mattress electronically controlled for firmness and support.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the hotel room of the 21st century _ actually a
composite of three Traveler Lifestyle Centers now on the drawing
board at the Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and Restaurant
Management at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The college, already an international leader in studies
combining traveler needs and modern technology, is working with
Hilton Hotels to enhance the company's well-received Sleep-Tight
Rooms _ designed with input from the National Sleep Foundation _
and develop two new environmental concept lodgings: Health-Fit
Rooms and Stress-Less Rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Variations on all three concepts will be installed over the next
year at the UH Hilton, one of nine used for the project. Guests
will be asked to evaluate innovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``With only 86 rooms, it's easier for us to track and evaluate
new concepts here than at a larger facility,'' says college dean
Alan Stutts. ``We have an advantage in that our guests include
significant numbers of both leisure and business travelers. And
they recognize that we are part of a learning institution. If we
point out certain things we'd like them to evaluate, most are
usually happy to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially exciting because we'll be able to prototype
and test ideas that we can pass along to others in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad N. Hilton College personnel recently participated in a
travel-related symposium focusing on stress, health and fitness.
The college also has been actively involved in sleep and stress
studies and in conferences aimed at fostering better appreciation
of travelers' diversity.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stutts, these Traveler Lifestyle Centers may
represent merely a beginning. With continued technological
advancements and the increased popularity of frequent-guest
programs, hoteliers are now in position to all but custom-design
accommodations for individuals willing to provide personal data. It
could include age, nationality and language, religious
requirements, exercise and entertainment needs, job-related needs,
stress-relief preferences, sleep disorders, dietary restrictions,
allergies and amenity preferences.
</P>
<P>
   The new concepts are driven by several factors. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Competition to provide the ultimate in comfort, still the No.
1 priority of most guests, according to surveys.
</P>
<P>
   _ Security and safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Business travelers' in-room work requirements.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increased stress associated with travel.
</P>
<P>
   Stutts says that hoteliers, addressing studies that show one of
the main causes of business travelers' stress and restlessness is
separation from the family, are determining ways that technology
can put families in verbal and visual contact at relatively low
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies on sound and light are showing how adjustments can
help each guest reach maximum rest and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   Configuration is another priority: Stutts says hotel rooms of
the future will be designed to meet specific needs of seniors,
travelers with disabilities and increasing numbers of women
business travelers.
</P>
<P>
   In-room work stations, with various hookups for computers and
fax machines, will become routine. And guests will have easy access
to the Internet and other online services.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding on the popularity of health clubs, a new emphasis will
be placed on in-room fitness. Stutts envisions fine-tuning room
menus to fit individual guests' dietary needs. Beyond supplying
sneakers and gym shorts, he says, ``Perhaps we'll provide small
equipment such as products with which you can do in-room resistance
exercises using doors or chairs. And maybe you'll prefer a vitamin
on your pillow at night instead of a mint.''
</P>
<P>
   You may have to forego a bubble bath, though. Just as room keys
_ a security risk _ will become relics, the bathtub, Stutts says,
will give way in most rooms to versatile showers that provide steam
baths, water massages and other health-oriented devices. Studies
show most guests now prefer showers. And tubs create liability
concerns for hoteliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there will probably always be some rooms with tubs,''
Stutts assures.
</P>
<P>
   Stutts concedes that not every new concept will meet with
approval. ``We'll probably switch things in and out of rooms, and
we'll want guests to tell us what they like and don't like,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Even with so much advanced research and technology, the Conrad
N. Hilton College dean notes one irony: The overriding objective of
the hotel room of the future is no different than in the past and
present.
</P>
<P>
   It's to provide a good night's sleep.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Once again Russia is having a change of government. This is
symptomatic of a dangerous problem. The highly touted ``energetic
technocrat'' whose approval by the legislature was obtained after
much arm-twisting is out. The acting prime minister is Viktor
Chernomyrdin, sourly dismissed a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits are at a loss wondering how to interpret these
developments. The answer, however, is simple. Another attempt to
force a set of impossible economic programs on the country has
failed. Now our failed leaders are casting about for a straw to
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the policy course pursued since 1992 is so
obvious that it has now been recognized officially.
</P>
<P>
   The country is being swept by a new devastating wave of the
financial crisis. The stock market hits new lows every day. Despite
having obtained multibillion dollar loans abroad, the Russian
government has been forced to take emergency measures to halt the
free-fall or at least to ease the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation of the ruble and the real threat of bankruptcy
have demonstrated that the system born of the reckless, selfishly
conceived reforms of the 1990s is unsustainable. A speculative
economy, a corrupt government, a criminalized environment, tens of
millions of forgotten and abandoned people: Such is the outcome of
the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   The defining fact today is the credibility gap dividing the
authorities and Russian society. The crisis is not so much economic
as political.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, the president and his entourage tried to
ignore this fact. Today they seem to be waking up to what's
happening. Continuing to cling to power while closing their eyes
and plugging their ears could be self-defeating. The appointment of
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister is therefore likely to signal
the beginning of the process of transferring power to an heir
apparent. We are witnessing Yeltsin's political sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a hidden agenda here. By all indications, the
president wants to use Chernomyrdin to try to prolong his political
existence, to somehow make it to the constitutionally mandated
election time. The new premier has thus been assigned the role of
the chief firefighter called in to save the regime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chernomyrdin too needs time to raise his
extremely low popularity rating in preparation for presidential
elections. The prime minister's office gives him leverage to do
that, but it is unlikely that he will succeed, given the depth of
the crisis and the current lineup of political forces.
</P>
<P>
   But is there perhaps some hope that the ``heavyweight''
Chernomyrdin has been called in for a different purpose _ that at
long last he will form a government capable of changing the course.
</P>
<P>
   Much as one might wish to believe it, it is unlikely. The
extraordinary difficulties Russia is experiencing today began, as
everyone knows, on Chernomyrdin's watch and with his involvement.
Thus the reemergence of Chernomyrdin does nothing to address the
federal authority's credibility problem. It does not create the
trust needed to solve any major issue.
</P>
<P>
   The call for early elections, therefore, continues to be timely
and urgent. Indeed, early elections of the president and of the
Duma, which bears its share of responsibility for what has happened
to Russia, are indispensable, as is a referendum to amend the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the role of the legislature should be
increased. It is very important to normalize the presidency. Russia
needs a balanced system of institutions of government. Only a
strong, functional parliament and an effective cabinet and
president can implement policies of economic growth and Russia's
revival.
</P>
<P>
   The state has to play an essential regulating role to help
realize the country's enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today conditions are still in place to conduct early elections
in an orderly way, taking advantage of the fact that the widespread
popular discontent has not yet burst out in extreme forms. But the
legendary patience of the Russian people should not be tested too
long. It has its limits.

   Once again Russia is having a change of government. This is
symptomatic of a dangerous problem. The highly touted ``energetic
technocrat'' whose approval by the legislature was obtained after
much arm-twisting is out. The acting prime minister is Viktor
Chernomyrdin, sourly dismissed a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The pundits are at a loss wondering how to interpret these
developments. The answer, however, is simple. Another attempt to
force a set of impossible economic programs on the country has
failed. Now our failed leaders are casting about for a straw to
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the policy course pursued since 1992 is so
obvious that it has now been recognized officially.
</P>
<P>
   The country is being swept by a new devastating wave of the
financial crisis. The stock market hits new lows every day. Despite
having obtained multibillion dollar loans abroad, the Russian
government has been forced to take emergency measures to halt the
free-fall or at least to ease the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The devaluation of the ruble and the real threat of bankruptcy
have demonstrated that the system born of the reckless, selfishly
conceived reforms of the 1990s is unsustainable. A speculative
economy, a corrupt government, a criminalized environment, tens of
millions of forgotten and abandoned people: Such is the outcome of
the Yeltsin era.
</P>
<P>
   The defining fact today is the credibility gap dividing the
authorities and Russian society. The crisis is not so much economic
as political.
</P>
<P>
   Until very recently, the president and his entourage tried to
ignore this fact. Today they seem to be waking up to what's
happening. Continuing to cling to power while closing their eyes
and plugging their ears could be self-defeating. The appointment of
Chernomyrdin as acting prime minister is therefore likely to signal
the beginning of the process of transferring power to an heir
apparent. We are witnessing Yeltsin's political sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is a hidden agenda here. By all indications, the
president wants to use Chernomyrdin to try to prolong his political
existence, to somehow make it to the constitutionally mandated
election time. The new premier has thus been assigned the role of
the chief firefighter called in to save the regime.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Chernomyrdin too needs time to raise his
extremely low popularity rating in preparation for presidential
elections. The prime minister's office gives him leverage to do
that, but it is unlikely that he will succeed, given the depth of
the crisis and the current lineup of political forces.
</P>
<P>
   But is there perhaps some hope that the ``heavyweight''
Chernomyrdin has been called in for a different purpose _ that at
long last he will form a government capable of changing the course.
</P>
<P>
   Much as one might wish to believe it, it is unlikely. The
extraordinary difficulties Russia is experiencing today began, as
everyone knows, on Chernomyrdin's watch and with his involvement.
Thus the reemergence of Chernomyrdin does nothing to address the
federal authority's credibility problem. It does not create the
trust needed to solve any major issue.
</P>
<P>
   The call for early elections, therefore, continues to be timely
and urgent. Indeed, early elections of the president and of the
Duma, which bears its share of responsibility for what has happened
to Russia, are indispensable, as is a referendum to amend the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   I am convinced that the role of the legislature should be
increased. It is very important to normalize the presidency. Russia
needs a balanced system of institutions of government. Only a
strong, functional parliament and an effective cabinet and
president can implement policies of economic growth and Russia's
revival.
</P>
<P>
   The state has to play an essential regulating role to help
realize the country's enormous potential.
</P>
<P>
   Today conditions are still in place to conduct early elections
in an orderly way, taking advantage of the fact that the widespread
popular discontent has not yet burst out in extreme forms. But the
legendary patience of the Russian people should not be tested too
long. It has its limits.

 By GRIGORY YAVLINSKY  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Five years ago, the so-called reformers running Russia concluded
that three things were essential for economic growth: a stable
exchange rate, low inflation and the re-election of Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    The challenge was to achieve each as quickly as possible, after
which the economic transformation would be largely secured.
 &HT;    But it was a trap. Financial stabilization was achieved, but not
economic growth. And with the re-election of the president, in a
notoriously unfair process, a kind of political stabilization was
achieved, but not political reform. Aid was given by the West, but
not in a determined manner that would encourage change.
 &HT;    The result is more costly by the day. Economic stagnation is one
reason. Russia's gross domestic product is half the level it was 10
years ago under communism. Another is that the so-called ``shock
reforms'' _ particularly the ill-fated voucher privatization _ only
drove the economy to barter. Up to 75 percent of the entire
economic turnover runs on barter, promissory notes and other money
surrogates.
 &HT;    In such a duty-free economy, the main problem is not the failure
to collect taxes, but the absence of an economy from which taxes
could be drawn. The government has covered its deficits with
foreign and domestic loans at exceedingly high interest rates.
 &HT;    Now the government cannot pay its bills, its staggering debts or
even its interest payments. It is being forced back to devaluation,
inflation and the same financial instability as before. The only
option offered is more debt _ $22.6 billion from the International
Monetary Fund, World Bank and Japan, to add to the $5.5 billion
already borrowed.
 &HT;    This time, there is likely to be more political instability. For
six years, people have been patient. They have lived without jobs
and without money, waiting for the results of the reforms because
they understood that they were necessary. They are broke, and if
prices begin to skyrocket, they could take to the streets.
 &HT;    It is already starting. People are calling for Yeltsin's
resignation _ not only coal miners and communists, but politicians,
businessmen and other elites, as well as students and people
throughout the regions. It is like a wave; left unchecked, it has
revolutionary potential.
 &HT;    This is Russia, and thus the question of what should be done is
almost a philosophical one. With no reliable mechanism available to
remove the president, it is likely and probably best (in
constitutional terms at least) that he serve out his term, through
the presidential elections in 2000. No one knows whether the newly
appointed administration can address the depth of the economic and
political crises, sustain the confidence of the people and of
investors, and carry support from the State Duma.
 &HT;    This would require a fundamental shift of politics in Moscow and
may seem utopian. But at least now even the robber barons
understand that serious mistakes have been made. Even they can see
that the ruble crisis is a symptom of the broader crisis of
confidence throughout the country.
 &HT;    Only Russia can save itself, but the West can help. To be
effective, however, it must be serious. Economic assistance must be
linked to deep structural as well as political reform.
 &HT;    Western policy must move beyond its reliance on the single
personality of the president to build relationships with a far
broader range of politicians, parties and institutions.
 &HT;    Russia has to transform almost everything, and the necessary
reforms cover the whole gamut: stopping corruption, developing
civil society at grass-roots levels, increasing decentralization,
reducing bureaucracy, building real political parties, securing a
truly independent press, reforming the judiciary and instigating a
raft of measures in the economic sphere.
 &HT;    Shock therapy cannot be applied. Reforms must occur at a speed
that supports, rather than damages, democratic development. Like
the pedals of a bicycle, institutional and political reform must
turn together.
 &HT;    But unless a definitive course is set to achieve these changes,
an open economy will never be effective, and stabilization will
never be achieved. Merely giving cash now while Russia burns is a
waste.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    When President Clinton meets with President Boris Yeltsin in
Moscow, each may take comfort from the other's domestic political
difficulties. It is important, however, that any focus on their
respective troubles also includes a careful examination of pressing
international security challenges.
 &HT;    At the top of this agenda should be a discussion of how to
reinvigorate U.S.-Russian cooperation to combat the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.
 &HT;    Although the United States and the Soviet Union often cooperated
closely on nonproliferation policy during the Cold War, by now
their partnership has begun to deteriorate. Here are some of the
symptoms of this unraveling:
 &HT;    _ The current stalemate in strategic-arms control negotiations;
 &HT;    _ Major disputes over Russian nuclear and missile exports to
Iran and India;
 &HT;    _ Disagreement about the activities of the U.N. Special
Commission on Iraq;
 &HT;    _ Lack of meaningful intelligence-sharing concerning illicit
trafficking in nuclear arms and material;
 &HT;    _ The absence of cooperation on important regional security
issues in South Asia, the Middle East and North Korea;
 &HT;    _ Increasing domestic pressures in both Russia and the United
States to give priority to short-term economic and political
considerations rather than long-term international security and
weapons-control objectives.
 &HT;    These strains are increasing at a time when the global
nonproliferation regime is facing urgent challenges that demand
coordinated leadership from the world's two leading nuclear powers.
 &HT;    Recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan could lead to the
dismantling of the global nonproliferation regime based on the 1968
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The
leadership _ or lack thereof _ displayed by the United States and
Russia over the India-Pakistan crisis may well determine whether
the non-proliferation regime endures.
 &HT;    A second challenge is coping effectively with the nuclear legacy
of the Cold War, including the safeguarding of Russia's enormous
stocks of fissile material and the downsizing of Russia's bloated
military-industrial complex. Russia and the United States must both
deepen and broaden their cooperation if these objectives are to be
achieved.
 &HT;    In addition, both parties will increasingly need to cooperate to
combat the problem of terrorism involving weapons of mass
destruction.
 &HT;    Even concerted pressure by the United States and Russia would
probably not roll back the nuclear programs in India and Pakistan.
Instead, Moscow and Washington should take steps to bolster the
nonproliferation concept by ``de-glamorizing'' nuclear weapons and
fostering nuclear disarmament.
 &HT;    With the START II treaty deadlocked in the Russian parliament,
an alternative means of accomplishing this objective would be to
jump-start the disarmament process by taking steps to reduce U.S.
and Russian arsenals of tactical nuclear weapons. The United States
could take a major step in this direction by unilaterally
withdrawing its few remaining tactical nuclear weapons based in
Europe, which have little military value, but enormous symbolic
significance to Russia.
 &HT;    This step would help defuse a potential contest in the region,
where many Russian officials have argued that Russia will have to
increase its reliance on tactical nuclear weapons in response to
NATO enlargement. It could also help revive the stalled START
process, and serve as a first step toward formally codifying the
1991 Bush-Gorbachev declarations on the withdrawal of non-strategic
nuclear weapons.
 &HT;    The United States and Russia should also work together to
support initiatives by non-nuclear weapons states for legally
binding security assurances and the creation of nuclear-free zones.
The five countries of post-Soviet Central Asia _ Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan _ are currently drafting a
treaty to create a such a zone in Central Asia.
 &HT;    Russian and U.S. efforts to publicly encourage and facilitate
this effort would send a positive signal to non-nuclear nations
about the benefits of nonproliferation, and would also have
symbolic importance, given the region's proximity to India and
Pakistan.
 &HT;    One bright area of U.S.-Russian cooperation in recent years has
been joint efforts to increase the security and accountability of
nuclear materials in Russia.
 &HT;    As part of a continuing effort to consolidate former Soviet
nuclear materials and increase their security, Presidents Clinton
and Yeltsin should consider launching a joint initiative to buy up
the relatively small but significant quantities of highly enriched
uranium stored at sites in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Ukraine,
and Uzbekistan. Depending on the political relations among the
parties, some of the material could be returned to Russia, while
the remainder would be exported to the United States.
 &HT;    As part of such a program, Russia and the United States should
also collaborate on refitting the research reactors in these
countries to run on low-enriched uranium, which presents a much
lesser proliferation threat than uranium.
 &HT;    In addition, the United States and Russia should begin to do
more than simply talk about cooperating on issues of terrorism.
Concrete steps should be taken to implement prior
intelligence-sharing agreements, to expand physical protection from
the threat of radiological sabotage and to improve enforcement of
existing export-control laws and regulations.
 &HT;    Perhaps the greatest difficulty in forging a more effective and
coordinated strategy for future U.S.-Russian cooperation is that
proliferation issues occupy a different place in the hierarchy of
national policy in Russia than in the United States. This
different, lower ranking is not because Russian policymakers
disagree with their U.S. counterparts about the dangers of weapons
of mass destruction. Instead, it is a perception of the issue's
minor relevance to the immediate economic and political situation.
 &HT;    President Clinton needs to take advantage of the Moscow summit
to refocus attention on the pressing nature of the proliferation
threat _ a paramount security challenge to both nations and one
that requires concerted cooperation.

coordinated leadership from the world's two leading nuclear powers.
 &HT;    Recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan could lead to the
dismantling of the global nonproliferation regime based on the 1968
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The
leadership _ or lack thereof _ displayed by the United States and
Russia over the India-Pakistan crisis may well determine whether
the non-proliferation regime endures.
 &HT;    A second challenge is coping effectively with the nuclear legacy
of the Cold War, including the safeguarding of Russia's enormous
stocks of fissile material and the downsizing of Russia's bloated
military-industrial complex. Russia and the United States must both
deepen and broaden their cooperation if these objectives are to be
achieved.
 &HT;    In addition, both parties will increasingly need to cooperate to
combat the problem of terrorism involving weapons of mass
destruction.
 &HT;    Even concerted pressure by the United States and Russia would
probably not roll back the nuclear programs in India and Pakistan.
Instead, Moscow and Washington should take steps to bolster the
nonproliferation concept by ``de-glamorizing'' nuclear weapons and
fostering nuclear disarmament.
 &HT;    With the START II treaty deadlocked in the Russian parliament,
an alternative means of accomplishing this objective would be to
jump-start the disarmament process by taking steps to reduce U.S.
and Russian arsenals of tactical nuclear weapons. The United States
could take a major step in this direction by unilaterally
withdrawing its few remaining tactical nuclear weapons based in
Europe, which have little military value, but enormous symbolic
significance to Russia.
 &HT;    This step would help defuse a potential contest in the region,
where many Russian officials have argued that Russia will have to
increase its reliance on tactical nuclear weapons in response to
NATO enlargement. It could also help revive the stalled START
process, and serve as a first step toward formally codifying the
1991 Bush-Gorbachev declarations on the withdrawal of non-strategic
nuclear weapons.
 &HT;    The United States and Russia should also work together to
support initiatives by non-nuclear weapons states for legally
binding security assurances and the creation of nuclear-free zones.
The five countries of post-Soviet Central Asia _ Kazakhstan,
Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan _ are currently drafting a
treaty to create a such a zone in Central Asia.
 &HT;    Russian and U.S. efforts to publicly encourage and facilitate
this effort would send a positive signal to non-nuclear nations
about the benefits of nonproliferation, and would also have
symbolic importance, given the region's proximity to India and
Pakistan.
 &HT;    One bright area of U.S.-Russian cooperation in recent years has
been joint efforts to increase the security and accountability of
nuclear materials in Russia.
 &HT;    As part of a continuing effort to consolidate former Soviet
nuclear materials and increase their security, Presidents Clinton
and Yeltsin should consider launching a joint initiative to buy up
the relatively small but significant quantities of highly enriched
uranium stored at sites in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Ukraine,
and Uzbekistan. Depending on the political relations among the
parties, some of the material could be returned to Russia, while
the remainder would be exported to the United States.
 &HT;    As part of such a program, Russia and the United States should
also collaborate on refitting the research reactors in these
countries to run on low-enriched uranium, which presents a much
lesser proliferation threat than uranium.
 &HT;    In addition, the United States and Russia should begin to do
more than simply talk about cooperating on issues of terrorism.
Concrete steps should be taken to implement prior
intelligence-sharing agreements, to expand physical protection from
the threat of radiological sabotage and to improve enforcement of
existing export-control laws and regulations.
 &HT;    Perhaps the greatest difficulty in forging a more effective and
coordinated strategy for future U.S.-Russian cooperation is that
proliferation issues occupy a different place in the hierarchy of
national policy in Russia than in the United States. This
different, lower ranking is not because Russian policymakers
disagree with their U.S. counterparts about the dangers of weapons
of mass destruction. Instead, it is a perception of the issue's
minor relevance to the immediate economic and political situation.
 &HT;    President Clinton needs to take advantage of the Moscow summit
to refocus attention on the pressing nature of the proliferation
threat _ a paramount security challenge to both nations and one
that requires concerted cooperation.
 &HT;     (William C. Potter is director of the Center for
Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International
Studies. Scott Parrish is a senior research associate at the
center.)

   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE MURDER OF HELEN JEWETT &QL; 
 &UR; Patricia Cline Cohen (Knopf, $27.50)
</P>
<P>
   In the early hours of April 10, 1836, a back door was found ajar
in a Manhattan brothel in which nine women earned their living. The
mistress of the brothel went to make sure everyone was all right.
When she came to the room occupied by Helen Jewett, she found the
door unlocked, and when she opened it smoke poured into the
hallway. She fought her way inside and found Jewett's charred body
in a pool of blood on the bed, with three gashes on Jewett's brow.
The prostitute's violent death caused a sensation in the city,
especially after Richard Robinson, son of a Connecticut landowner
and state legislator, was charged with the crime. Cohen traces
Robinson's background as well as Jewett's, and shows how sexual
commerce was handled in a gentler, less garish time. The case ended
in a quick and, Cohen indicates, faulty verdict of not-guilty.
Reviewers have made comparisons to the O.J. Simpson case _ he loved
her, he slashed her and he got away. This is the more interesting
case, however, and Jewett the more sympathetic victim. Cohen has
written an overlong but still fascinating look at another era and
how a violent act held everyone in thrall. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; PORTRAITS &QL; 
 &UR; Michael Kimmelman (Random House, $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   We read books for the moments they give us, the moments that
stay with us when the book is done so that we can take them with us
back into our lives. This book began with a challenging premise:
Kimmelman, art critic for the ``New York Times,'' went to major
museums in the company of major artists, and listened as in the
process of talking about the work of others, they talked about
themselves. Some were oddly ill-prepared for it _ Cindy Sherman had
no interest in art history, and was as baffled as a tourist by the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. In contrast, Richard Serra was restless
and rapt as he paced before the paintings on the wall. And here is
a moment: The roguish Henri Cartier-Bresson paused in a room of
Matisses to take a sketchbook from his knapsack and make a
rendering. As he worked, tourists _ unaware of who he was, says
Kimmelman, ``but charmed by the sight of an old man sketching'' _
snapped his picture. The famous photographer ignored them, then
said, ``Geothe wrote that the best way to understand a painting was
by drawing it, and he's right. How many people have been here? A
dozen? And they don't look. They all have their cameras. But
looking is meditation and how can you meditate and look through a
camera at the same time?'' Kimmelman reworked these stories from a
series that appeared in the ``Times.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE FOREIGN STUDENT &QL; 
 &UR; Susan Choi (Harper Flamingo, $23)
</P>
<P>
   This elegant and assured first novel is set in the American
South just after the Korean War. Chang Ahn _ he is called ``Chuck''
by the Americans _ has arrived in Sewanee, Tenn., to attend the
university there and to escape the nightmares of his homeland.
Chuck is an outsider, racially and emotionally set apart from the
Southerners around him. He is adrift in this new world, struggling
to learn English, to ingratiate himself to the people he now lives
among and to gain some kind of equilibrium after the traumas of his
past. He seems an unlikely candidate for a love affair, but that's
what Choi steers him toward through most of her book, and the
anticipation of it is both delicious and unsettling. The woman is
Katherine Monroe, who since the age of 14 has been the mistress of
the charismatic university professor who was one of the first
people to befriend the Korean refugee. Choi, a fact-checker at
``The New Yorker,'' tells their story with meticulous attention to
detail and unfailing self-confidence. She is a writer to watch. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; MARKING THE SPARROW'S FALL &QL; 
 &UR; Wallace Stegner (Holt, $25)
</P>
<P>
   Without his father, says Page Stegner, who edited this book,
``the modern conservation movement would still be trying to mine
quotable nuggets from Henry David Thoreau and Aldo Leopold.''
Wallace Stegner, who died in 1993, left enough quotable nuggets to
last for as long as we care to listen. This is composed mostly of
essays that have never been collected in book form. The only
fiction included is ``Genesis,'' a novella from Stegner's ``Wolf
Willow,'' a history/memoir/story of the Cypress Hills country of
Saskatchewan. Stegner called it an ``ordeal story'' like the ones
Joseph Conrad wrote. ``And if I were to confess the full truth,''
he said, ``I would have to admit that all the time I was writing
(it) I felt a good deal like Conrad on a cowhorse.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; COLD WAR: AN ILLUSTRATED HISTORY 1945-1991 &QL; 
 &UR; Jeremy Isaacs, Taylor Downing (Little Brown, $39.95)
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, it was the time of the ``Great Fear.''
School children practiced crouching in hallways in a ludicrous
effort to survive nuclear attack, and Hollywood danced to Joseph
McCarthy's hysterical tune. In the Soviet Union it was worse, the
time of the ``Great Terror,'' when American problems paled in
comparison to the paranoia that permeated the Soviet system. This
book, a companion to the CNN television series, chronicles what its
authors call the ``central story of our times,'' and the crises _
in Berlin, Budapest, Havana, Prague and Saigon _ that brought us to
the brink of nuclear war. In the end, say the authors, leaders on
both sides put humanity's interests higher than national advantage,
but we were never sure that's what they would do. ``For 45 years,''
they write, ``the peoples of the world held their breath, and
survived.''

ODWALLA PUTS LEGAL WOES BEHIND, LAUNCHES NEW PRODUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GEORGE RAINE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five weeks after pleading guilty to federal
criminal charges stemming from bacterial infections traced to a
batch of its fresh apple juice, Odwalla Inc. rolled out a new food
bar as part of its effort to look to the future and not to its
troubled past.
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla became the first company convicted in a food
contamination outbreak and paid the largest criminal fine _ $1.5
million _ for a food injury case, all part of the E. coli outbreak
of Halloween 1996, when a child died and more than 60 people became
ill after drinking unpasteurized Odwalla apple juice.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the first day of its 1999 fiscal year, the company
effectively announced it is moving on and, notwithstanding the
approximately $15 million it recently paid in outbreak-related
civil settlements, is spending money to compete in a crowded field
made popular by, among others, Kellogg's Nutri-Grain bar.
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla's first three bars _ Cranberry Citrus, Organic Carrot &AMP;
Raisin and Peach Crunch _ are made from organic oats, brown rice,
nuts and fruits.
</P>
<P>
   They have no wheat but contain natural nectars.
</P>
<P>
   They were nine months in testing and baking, Stephen Williamson,
Odwalla's chief executive officer, said Monday. The period covers
the very time the company wad under pressure from the Justice
Department, plaintiffs' lawyers and a declining stock price.
</P>
<P>
   The company is based in Half Moon Bay, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Odwalla bars made their appearance in retail markets to
compete in a category that does $894.2 million in annual sales,
said Ray Wisbrock, a spokesman for Information Resources of
Chicago, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever their marketing intentions are, they have an uphill
fight,'' said Gene Grabowski, vice president of the Grocery
Manufacturers of America, a trade association in Washington, D.C.
``The health food companies, in addition to the cereal
manufacturers and Power Bar, are already there.''
</P>
<P>
   The category includes bars packed with nutrients for energy,
including Power Bar and Clif Bar; meal replacement bars, including
Balance Bar, with a mix of carbohydrates, protein and fat; and
breakfast bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Odwalla could play in any of these three, but probably it will
create its own _ the all-natural nutrition bar _ because it can
build on (the company image), which is natural, and with fresh
ingredients _ real authentic food,'' said Bonnie Kramer Tonneson,
an analyst at Hembricht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   She recommended Odwalla as a buy after it agreed July 24 to
enter the guilty plea in federal court and pay the $1.5 million
fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pivotal for the company, enabling management to focus
on business as opposed to lawsuits,'' she said, ``giving them the
freedom to possibly enter the capital markets and to focus on
hiring new talent. Those are not things you want to do when you
have lawsuits hanging over your head.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Patsky, an analyst at Adams, Harkness &AMP; Hill in Boston,
said, ``They have gotten beyond the problem of the outbreak and
have settled the suits and are starting now to grow the business
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Odwalla stock attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson said that many Odwalla customers buy food bars, ``and
now they have a chance to buy our bar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not looking to rule the roost in the food bar business,
but this is another step in broadening our nourishment offering,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg's Nutri-Grain, effective July 12, had year-over year
U.S. sales of $150.4 million, up 10.1 percent for a market share of
16.8 percent, Wisbrock said.
</P>
<P>
   Second was Quaker Oats' Chewy, with sales of $120.3 million, up
5.4 percent for 13.5 percent market share. Down the list was Power
Bar, with sales of $30.4 million, up 12.4 percent, for 3.4 percent
market share.
</P>
<P>
   Odwalla has improved chances for its product launch, however, by
expanding its markets in the past eight months. Its juices and
other products are now in Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis,
Philadelphia, Phoenix and Washington, D.C. They have long been
available in California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon,
Texas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, this bar is a good representation of what
the company does, which is easy access to great-tasting
nourishment,'' Williamson said.

<P>
   KINGSTON, Jamaica _ ``Crime's so bad they'll cut off your arm to
get a nice watch,'' warned the American businessman seated beside
me during a nearly two-hour flight from Miami to Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ominous beginning to what was supposed to be a quick
business trip to paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Often I'd heard Jamaica, the Caribbean's largest
English-speaking country, touted as a succulently green island,
where honeymooners munch on mangoes for breakfast at posh hotels
while gazing at blooming hibiscus plants and palm trees dripping
with coconuts.
</P>
<P>
   This island of 2.5 million people welcomed 1.9 million tourists
last year, many of whom were undoubtedly charmed by the country's
azure waters and mountains that look as high as heaven.
</P>
<P>
   And it is true that the scenery in many parts of this
Connecticut-sized nation is spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another side to Jamaica that lies beyond the high
walls of all-inclusive resorts.
</P>
<P>
   I found, for example, that driving through this capital city was
like driving through the worst slums of Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   Children in tattered clothing live inside squalid shanties with
corrugated tin roofs in neighborhoods where rancid fruit stands and
closet-sized liquor stores are fixtures and the only
sanitary-looking structure is a Texaco service station.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is like El Salvador after the war except that there
wasn't any war in Jamaica,'' exclaimed a dumbfounded official at
the U.S. Embassy here.
</P>
<P>
   But what the country has suffered from is an economy in
shambles.
</P>
<P>
   When most of the world was enjoying an economic boon, Jamaica's
economy was shrinking by nearly 3 percent in both 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   What this means is that even Haiti -- the Western Hemisphere's
poorest country -- has a better-performing economy than Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Just the sheer unreliability of everyday life offers a peephole
into the downturn's effect on average citizens.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  With many manholes uncovered, walking down a sidewalk can be
precarious business.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A sign in Montego Bay claims Kingston is 190 kilometers away;
another says 122.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And, in a country that sees rain almost every afternoon, many
people are without water 12 hours a day thanks to broken pipes that
allow an estimated 60 percent of the water supply to escape.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to blame for the country's devastating recession is a
massive government debt that has choked off any chance at
development. Interest rates of 40 percent have slowed investment.
And, as an unemployment rate now at nearly 20 percent has grown, so
has its dark shadow -- crime.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 murders were reported here last year, a rate
fueled primarily by a thriving drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There're few places doing as poorly as Jamaica,'' laments
Charles Ross, executive director of the Private Sector Organization
of Jamaica. ``And, we expect another year of negative growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The government points to inflation of 9 percent in 1997 -- the
first single-digit increase in a decade -- as a resounding
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   It has also managed to forestall a spectacular financial-system
collapse by taking over 50 percent of all the banks and financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the government of Prime Minister P.J.
Patterson has increased the number of public-sector employees by 11
percent when most other Caribbean governments have trimmed bloated
bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   Economists agree that the only thing keeping Jamaica's economy
afloat today are $800 million in remittances the island receives
each year from the 2 million or so Jamaicans who're living
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what has average Jamaicans scratching their heads is
that, in a country strapped for cash, the government promised each
member of its soccer team, dubbed the Reggae Boyz, a two-acre
building plot and a low-cost home loan after it won a place in the
World Cup final late last year.
</P>
<P>
   And they're still baffled over the Jamaican Tourist Board's
decision last year to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to
commission what it had hoped would be the world's largest
inflatable soccer ball as part of a promotional scheme only to have
it rejected by the Guinness Book of Records.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to wonder what the government is thinking,''
pondered Gerald Hamilton, a taxi driver.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Jamaica used to be one of the more prosperous
islands in the West Indies, and the preferred playground of
celebrities like Bette Davis and Rudyard Kipling.
</P>
<P>
   Even today the most popular saying on T-shirts here is ``Smile
Mon -- No Problem.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem on this lovely island -- an economic
crisis -- and until it's solved, this no-problem getaway offers
visitors very little to fantasize about.

About This Life: Journeys on the Threshold of Memory 
Barry Lopez (Knopf, $24) 
 
 By LUCI SCOTT  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To read Barry Lopez is to commune with a deep thinker.
</P>
<P>
   His newest book, ``About This Life: Journeys on the Threshold of
Memory,'' is an eclectic collection of essays developed over many
years. The book isn't easily categorized. It's not a travel book,
although it contains some travel writing. It's not a nature book,
although it teems with flora and fauna _ from the bananaquit, a
bird on Bonaire, to the prickly pear cactus on the Galapagos. It's
not strictly an autobiography, although there is an
autobiographical element, as well.
</P>
<P>
   The unifying theme of the book, says its editor, Robin Desser,
``has to do with the narrator taking us through all of Barry's
adventures _ personal, geographical and spiritual. If there's a
unifying theme, it's Barry and the way he thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a book to be savored, to be underlined, to be reread and
pondered.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, whose writings have been compared to those of Henry David
Thoreau and Edward Abbey, brings a depth of erudition to the text
by immersing himself in his surroundings. Before he wrote the
chapter about the island of Bonaire, a magnet for scuba divers, he
made 17 dives over eight days.
</P>
<P>
   His fascinating essay about international air cargo, an effort
that proves that the industry is not in the least prosaic, was
produced as he made 40 flights, covering about 110,000 nautical
miles, aboard 747 freighters and on 747 passenger planes hauling
cargo. He even brings the reader into Boeing's 98-acre assembly
building in Everett, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez highlighted the drama of the air-freight adventure by
describing a flight from Chicago's O'Hare to Tokyo's Narita,
carrying 16 horses: a Percheron stallion, 12 Appaloosas and three
quarter horses, accompanied by two handlers. The flight encountered
severe turbulence over Alaska, and, later, the automatic pilot
malfunctioned, plunging the nose into a rapid descent before the
pilot came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Facility with analogies is evident throughout Lopez's writing.
Gazing at the sea seven miles below his flight, he labels the ocean
crinkled like an elephant's skin. At Bonaire, the divers are
glinting like seals in the sunlight. In the Galapagos, he finds the
fog as melancholy as a rain-soaked dog. And a long hillside of
leafless palo santo trees are like a ``cinder wall of Chinese
calligraphy leaning into an azure sky.''
</P>
<P>
   His analogies enliven the text in other ways, as in: ``A
blue-footed booby chick, embraceable in its white down, stands
squarely before an ocean breeze, wrestling comically with its new
wings, like someone trying to fold a road map in a high wind.''
</P>
<P>
   The anecdotes of his travels include the tale of a dinner of raw
fish and sea vegetables in a home on Hokkaido, the northernmost of
the Japanese islands.
</P>
<P>
   Other essays in the mix cover his experience at clearing
highways of roadkill, a trek with a wolf biologist with Alaska Fish
and Game, a thoughtful piece on the American landscape, and an
eloquent essay on his hands.
</P>
<P>
   He turns more autobiographical in essays on Manhattan in 1976; a
visit to the Grand Canyon as a 9-year-old in 1954 and a return to
Arizona in 1980; Southern California in 1988; and Bear River,
Idaho, in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Travel writer Tim Cahill has said that his first job is to write
well, that a feat such as climbing Mount Everest barefoot would
mean little if he couldn't write well, and that good travel writing
is more than narration for a slide show.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, a recipient of numerous literary awards, including the
National Book Award for non-fiction, fulfills this dictum, with
eloquence.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Lopez is not insensitive to the growing awareness
among travel writers that just being at a site and, especially,
writing about it for the masses, will change that place forever.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Galapagos, he notes thoughtfully, are looking
for an answer to this question: How many people can simultaneously
be present at a single location in the park before a visitor's
sense of the magical remoteness of Galapagos is lost?

<P>
   Ranan Lurie is an internationally known political cartoonist and
analyst, whose work is published in 103 countries in 1,105
newspapers with a total circulation of 104 million readers. A
former Israeli combat major, who served as a commando during the
Six Day War _ and survived 144 paratrooper jumps _ Lurie is also a
master military tactician.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks here about the U.S. retaliatory raids into Sudan and
Afghanistan and raises important questions about U.S. goals, combat
readiness and willingness to fight _ as well as our understanding
of terrorism and the degree of threat it poses for the future.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; -0-
</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: How would you assess the U.S. missile
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: I believe these cruise missiles were the most
anticipated guests of Osama bin Laden. He is hiding in the
mountains, well prepared for cruise missiles; he is not impressed
by them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton forgot that the cruise missile is by now a
very known quantity. We have also the problem here of preparing for
the last war _ we shot scores of these missiles in the Persian Gulf
War. Generals always plan the next war on the criteria of the last
war.
</P>
<P>
   What I am trying to say is that every terrorist organization
today knows the chances are that 80 percent of U.S. retaliation
will be committed by cruise missiles. The United States has
established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as much
as possible on technology, while sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we don't want to report about casualties. The missiles
cost a lot of money, and nothing in American lives. They are
ineffective against terrorism unless all the bad guys, and all
their weapons, are in known, extensive, above-ground headquarters
or camps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What should we be doing? How can we surprise them? Can we
surprise them?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only way to surprise them would be by helicopter attacks,
landing Delta Force-type units, special commando forces that also
are enjoying superb intelligence _ this is where the CIA comes in
very strongly. And they actually clear the area.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I could envision an attack, with the aid of
Pakistan, of America's very superior helicopters, on that specific
spot, protected by air power, and a unit of about two companies
coming down, knocking on the door and demolishing the whole place,
and hopefully capturing its high command.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds as if you're saying we have the capability of doing
this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I think we have, but we don't have the stomach for it. Let us
remember when President Carter was trying to save the hostages in
Iran in 1980. He sent the helicopters, and there were equipment
failures and a crash in a sandstorm, and men killed, and the
mission was aborted. It caused tremendous damage to Carter, who
came out looking like a very incompetent leader.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, while he approved it, he didn't know the details, so
technically he wasn't responsible, but he was responsible as the
commander in chief. Now, basically, other commanders in chief don't
care to accidentally tread in those footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So when you speak of the stomach to fight, you are referring
to the politicians, not the warriors?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely, yes. You know, a platoon of Navy SEALS has so
much fire power ... As for the men, once they volunteer to the
Green Berets or the Delta Force or the Navy SEALS, they make a
commitment, a declaration. No one forces them to do it. They go
because of love of country _ or maybe for action and adventure, or
to impress a girlfriend or to be higher paid. They want to serve,
because that is what makes them a Delta Force.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you think we have the adequate intelligence capabilities
for such missions?
</P>
<P>
   A: I would hope so. Let us take, for instance, the Entebbe raid
by the Israelis. (In 1976, Israeli commandos attacked the airport
in Entebbe, Uganda and freed a hijacked Air France plane full of
French tourists returning from Israel.) At first, the Israelis knew
very little about the situation in Entebbe because the hijacking
and hostage-taking happened out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a tremendous disadvantage, intelligence-wise, in
comparison to the U.S. advantage, intelligence-wise, appropos Osama
bin Laden. We have known for years that bin Laden is organizing
something massive for terrorist attacks. He has boasted of it on
many occasions. I should assume this has make him one of the prime
intelligence targets the United States has in the world today.
</P>
<P>
   A person like this is an easy target for a powerful intelligence
operation: the CIA and so forth. It's also in the Pakistani
interest to know what is happening with him, so their agencies are
probably working on it. And all this intelligence would certainly
serve an operation by our special forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you don't feel the U.S. counterstrike will be an
effective deterrent?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm afraid the cruise missiles were the equivalent of a
military lip service. It was an operation that really could not
solve a problem. On the contrary, that was almost a knee-jerk
reaction because the military is shouting from here to Timbuktu,
for all the world to hear, `We can't afford losing people.'
</P>
<P>
   And the moment you say you can't afford losing people, the
terrorists gain a tremendous edge because they know they are not
going to suffer direct contact with American forces. They know they
would lose in any kind of contact with our elite troops. No one is
trained so well.
</P>
<P>
   Our goal had to be to destroy the people who send the
terrorists, and that didn't happen. It re-exposed our superior
technology, which is fine, but it also affirmed our fear of doing
the right thing and investing the right units, the only ones that
can do the job.
</P>
<P>
   I might add that this is exactly why we failed miserably in the
Persian Gulf War. We invested so many troops, about 600,000, on a
thing that 150,000 could have handled easily, and in the end
achieved almost nothing. We did free Kuwait, which is correct, but
it was like taking candy from a baby. Yet we did it with such
drama, and such pompous superiority. Once we realized we had to
bring down Saddam Hussein, we proved to be nothing. And why, I
don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe in the concept that the terrorist is not
afraid to die?
</P>
<P>
   A: Absolutely. This is the classic Iranian concept, that for the
terrorists who blow themselves up in buses driving toward embassies
or marketplaces in Israel, it is a tremendous honor. It is the
beginning of a new life. For them, losing lives is a way of life.
The fallen terrorists are `shahids,' the Arab word for martyr. As
martyrs they are going to a fantastic world where they are given
dozens of virgins, gorgeous ones, and they will have a life of
terrific riches, a Donald Trump-style life.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what do you think of bin Laden's motivations?
</P>
<P>
   A: What bin Laden thinks is that America is Satan, and therefore
we are condemned. He speaks openly of a fatwah on Americans, and
jeers at our soldiers as `paper tigers.' I believe he would sponsor
terrorism on American soil, without any moral hesitation, and
establish himself as a hero for the next 1,000 years in the
extremist world.
</P>
<P>
   We have to compare the stomach of facing a terrible loss of 20
or 30 very good young warriors to the stomach we'd need to face the
loss of millions in a city of the United States.

master military tactician.
</P>
<P>
   He speaks here about the U.S. retaliatory raids into Sudan and

readiness and willingness to fight _ as well as our understanding
of terrorism and the degree of threat it poses for the future.

</P>
<P>
   CAROLEE B. MORRISON: How would you assess the U.S. missile
attacks in Afghanistan and Sudan in retaliation for the embassy
bombings in Africa?
</P>
<P>
   RANAN LURIE: I believe these cruise missiles were the most
anticipated guests of Osama bin Laden. He is hiding in the
mountains, well prepared for cruise missiles; he is not impressed
by them.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton forgot that the cruise missile is by now a
very known quantity. We have also the problem here of preparing for
the last war _ we shot scores of these missiles in the Persian Gulf
War. Generals always plan the next war on the criteria of the last
war.
</P>
<P>
   What I am trying to say is that every terrorist organization
today knows the chances are that 80 percent of U.S. retaliation
will be committed by cruise missiles. The United States has
established itself as a fighting force that wants to rely as much
as possible on technology, while sacrificing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In terms of lives?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, we don't want to report about casualties. The missiles
cost a lot of money, and nothing in American lives. They are
ineffective against terrorism unless all the bad guys, and all
their weapons, are in known, extensive, above-ground headquarters
or camps.

A POET'S POET, STEVENS GAINS HIS DUE AT LAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wallace Stevens was slightly younger than Robert Frost and Carl
Sandburg, slightly older than T.S. Eliot and William Carlos
Williams, and never as familiar to the body public as any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Those other poets, and also such as Edna St. Vincent Millay,
Elizabeth Bishop and Marianne Moore, had long been on the scene
when Wallace Stevens burst forth in his late middle age with a
barrage of well-crafted verse quite youthful in character.
</P>
<P>
   The 1954 Pulitzer Prize for the collected body of his poetry
marked the solemnization of Wallace Stevens. Certified at last as a
``major'' American poet, he died the next year, aged 76.
</P>
<P>
   There were reasons the academy was slow in recognizing Stevens _
who, however, may never have received an unfavorable review for
anything he wrote. First, he never was a poet primarily.
</P>
<P>
   As a Harvard graduate with a degree in business administration,
he briefly entertained notions of a literary career and contributed
to Harriet Monroe's ``Poetry'' magazine when it was quite new, in
the years just before the first World War. Urged by his parents to
consider a more practical career, Stevens took a law degree from
New York University and then joined the Hartford Accident and
Indemnity corporation. His tenure as an insurance executive spanned
40 years (20 as vice president), and he was on the job the day he
died.
</P>
<P>
   Even though poetry was only an avocation for Stevens (although
an increasingly visible one), his reputation followed a steadily
upward curve, continuing to rise during his posthumous decades. He
is now past the debunking phase that customarily comes after an
artist's mortality, so it is likely that Stevens' high standing is
being secured by the just-published single-volume collection of his
poetry and prose by the Library of America.
</P>
<P>
   It's a curiosity. As the open-end Library of America series
closes in on 100 volumes, Wallace Stevens is only the second poet
honored by a full volume. Walt Whitman is the other. Whitman's
poetry and prose filled one of the four volumes that initiated the
series in 1982. (The other volumes contained works by Hawthorne,
Melville and Harriet Stowe.) Of course, there is a body of poetry
in an Emerson volume that is given more, however, to prose.
</P>
<P>
   One might have supposed that Longfellow or Whittier or each
would be accorded autonomous tribute, but not long ago the LOA
issued two volumes of 19th-century American poetry, granting
prominence to Longfellow, Whittier and Whitman (again) as well as
Bryant, Holmes, Lanier, et. al.; and apparently that will be their
level of recognition.
</P>
<P>
   One might also have expected a volume honoring a ``people's
poet'' such as Robert Frost to appear before one honoring ``poet's
poet'' Stevens. This may be a matter of literary politics, as some
copyright-holding publishers are reluctant to play ball with the
LOA. Thus the series now represents Faulkner, Steinbeck and
Sinclair Lewis, and also Cather and Wharton and Flannery O'Connor,
but no sign yet of Hemingway or Fitzgerald or Thomas Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, it is difficult (also foolish) to knock Stevens. He is
the most musical poet since Sidney Lanier; his is the poetic voice
of modernism most attuned to modern art; and he articulates a keen
intellect, heightened by a concern with means of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The Library of America offers Wallace Stevens complete, pulling
together hundreds of poems that appeared incrementally in volumes
with such titles as ``Harmonium,'' ``Ideas of Order,'' ``Parts of a
World,'' ``Transport to Summer,'' ``The Auroras of Autumn'' and
``The Rock.'' There is also ``The Man With the Blue Guitar,''
containing four quite long poems, the title piece spinning off a
painting by Pablo Picasso, with imaginative interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Stevens is not an easy poet, but neither is he oblique.
I'm told that he has lately emerged a favorite poet in university
classrooms. He is well-insured.

   GATOR-HUNT _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ At a half-hour before
sunset, some of the 680 men and women with permits for this year's
state alligator hunt set out with harpoons and bang sticks to bag
as many as five gators apiece. It's illegal to use rifles or
pistols to hunt the reptiles, so many hunters use hooked baits,
harpoons or arrows with lines attached to bring the gators to the
boat, said state biologist Lindsey Hord. Once the animals are
captured, hunters usually use a bang stick to kill them, Hord said.

STALE BREAD: NOT FOR THE BIRDS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bread salad is a traditional way of making good use of stale
bread. Like many old-fashioned preparations for salvaging food
before it goes bad (count pickles and jam among these), it has an
appeal of its own. This is especially true at this time of year,
when good tomatoes _ an ingredient in bread salads _ are plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   But what if your bread isn't quite stale? Solutions to this
rather unusual problem are to wait, to dry the bread in the oven
or, as I recently discovered, to use the grill or broiler. This
last method not only dries the bread more quickly but, by charring
the edges slightly, also adds another dimension of flavor. It's
like making toast _ exposing the bread to direct heat (rather than
the indirect heat of the oven) to brown and dry it.
</P>
<P>
   There's another benefit to grilling the bread to dry it: The
added flavor makes it possible to strip the salad to its bare
minimum. Originally, I always added chopped olives, capers and
minced anchovies to the tomatoes, olive oil and lemon juice in the
dish. Using grilled bread, however, I found that beyond lemon,
onion and a minimum of garlic (even this can be considered
optional), other strong flavors are superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Because this salad is juicy, almost saucy, and pleasantly
acidic, it makes a nice accompaniment to simply grilled meat or
poultry. It has a special affinity for dark fish, like tuna or
swordfish. You can make the salad a one-dish meal by grilling or
broiling shrimp or boneless chicken with the bread and adding
chunks to the salad.
</P>
<P>
   The only tricks here involve timing. You must watch the bread
carefully as you grill or broil; a slight char is good, but it's a
short step from there to burned bread. And the time you allow the
bread to soften after tossing it with the seasonings varies; keep
tasting until the texture pleases you. If your tomatoes are on the
dry side, you might add a little extra liquid, like more olive oil
and lemon juice, or a light sprinkling of water.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRILLED BREAD SALAD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 45 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   1 small baguette (about 8 ounces) or other crusty bread
</P>
<P>
   \ cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   \ cup fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons diced shallot, scallion or red onion
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon minced garlic, optional
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   \ cup or more roughly chopped basil or parsley.
</P>
<P>
   1. Start gas or charcoal grill, or preheat broiler; rack should
be 4 to 6 inches from heat source. Cut bread lengthwise into
quarters. Grill or broil the bread, watching carefully and turning
as each side browns and chars slightly; total time will be less
than 10 minutes. Remove, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. While bread cools, mix together next five ingredients in a
large bowl. Mash tomatoes with back of a fork to release all of
their juices. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Cut bread into
{- to 1-inch cubes (no larger), and toss them with the dressing.
</P>
<P>
   3. Let bread sit for 20 to 30 minutes, tossing occasionally and
tasting a piece every now and then. The salad is at its peak when
the bread is fairly soft but some edges remain crisp, but you can
serve it before or after it reaches that state. When it's ready,
stir in basil or parsley, and serve. &QL;

WINE OF THE WEEK: A TUSCAN GEM  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Ruffino Fonte al Sole 1997, Sangiovese di Toscana, Italy. About
$10. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The wine critic Robert M. Parker Jr. observed recently in his
newsletter that the selection of wines in the $10 category was vast
but mostly uninteresting. At first, I was skeptical, having come
across some good wines in that price range. Trying more of them
recently, I've come to agree with his assessment _ except where
Italy is concerned.
</P>
<P>
   There are good $10 red wines from every part of Italy, including
Sicily and Sardinia. This Fonte al Sole sangiovese from Ruffino is
a perfect example of what Italy can offer in a good, moderate-price
wine. Like Chiantis at twice its price, it is made from the
sangiovese grape. Also like Chiantis at twice its price, it comes
from Tuscany, and in fact, it could pass for some of them.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the first wines on the shelves from the great
1997 vintage. Why drink some dull California merlot, when wines
like this little gem are to be had?

HOW SWEET IT IS: A MODERATE INDULGENCE   (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do Sauternes, Tokay, trockenbeerenauslese, vendange
tardive, Dolce and Eisrebe have in common? They are some of the
world's finest wines, and they are all sweet. Beyond that, few wine
drinkers know much about them (except for Sauternes): where they
come from, how they are made or even what they taste like.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is our health-conscious era. To many people,
the word ``sweet'' denotes sinfulness or at least unwise excess.
But most sweet wines are drunk in moderation. The best of them are
too intense, too rich, to be enjoyed other than in small
quantities, at the end of a meal.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest way to make a wine sweet is to add sugar. Champagne
is treated this way. At the bottling, a small amount of sugar
dissolved in wine is added to impart a degree of sweetness: brut
Champagne is almost sugar-free, extra-dry is a bit sweeter, dry is
sweeter yet, and doux, much favored in Eastern Europe, is the
sweetest of all.
</P>
<P>
   Most wine grapes are full of sugar when they are picked. But the
wines made from them are usually dry because, in fermentation, the
sugar is converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide. Naturally sweet
wines are made by stopping fermentation before all the sugar has
been converted. What's left is called residual sugar. In this
country, some inexpensive dry table wines are permitted to retain a
small amount of residual sugar because of the wine industry's
belief that Americans, raised on soft drinks and fruit juice,
``talk dry but drink sweet.''
</P>
<P>
   Some sweet wines are called fortified wines because alcohol is
added to stop fermentation and retain a certain amount of residual
sugar in the finished wine. In port, the added spirits can amount
to a third of the wine's volume and bring its alcohol level up to
as much as 21 percent. In other fortified wines _ Madeira, Marsala
and sherry, for example _ less alcohol is added.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous sweet wines _ Sauternes from Bordeaux, Hungarian
Tokay and wines like them from Germany, Alsace and California _
need no added sugar. The grapes for them are picked late, when they
are overripe and, ideally, shriveled by botrytis cinerea, a
beneficial mold, which concentrates their sweetness. When their
supersweet juice is fermented, not all of it turns into alcohol,
and the result is an intense, naturally sweet wine.
</P>
<P>
   The botrytis, which does not appear in the vineyards every year,
adds a much-prized honey flavor to the wine. The taste of the best
of these wines is almost indescribable. They offer layers of
flavors of exotic fruits and rare spices with delicious aromas that
can fill a room like bouquets of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The rarest of these naturally sweet wines are the
trockenbeerenausleses from the Rheingau and Mosel regions of
Germany. Because of the severe weather in these northern vineyards,
ideal growing conditions occur infrequently, sometimes only once in
10 years. Trocken, meaning dry, refers to grapes left on the vine
until completely shriveled. Beeren means individual grapes, and
auslese means special selection. For obvious reasons,
English-speaking folks often call these wines TBA's.
</P>
<P>
   In Sauternes, the principal grape is semillon, often blended
with some sauvignon blanc. In Germany, the grape of choice is the
riesling, although in recent years, fine TBA's have been made from
the scheurebe grape, a cross between sylvaner and riesling. In
Alsace, on the west bank of the Rhine, where late-harvest wines are
known as vendange tardive, the most important grape is the
gewuerztraminer.
</P>
<P>
   California, as might be expected, offers a variety of sweet
wines, made from a variety of sweet grapes, many of them bland. The
best include a Sauternes-style wine from Far Niente Vineyards
called Dolce, a blend of semillon and sauvignon blanc; a riesling
and a wine called Eisrebe, from Joseph Phelps Vineyards, and the
occasional late-harvest rieslings and gewuerztraminers from Navarro
Vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Far Niente and Joseph Phelps are in the Napa Valley, Navarro in
Mendocino County.
</P>
<P>
   The name Eisrebe is a combination of eiswein and scheurebe.
Eiswein, or ice wine, is a late-harvest wine made from frozen
grapes. Historically, it was made from grapes deliberately left in
the German vineyards into winter, when the temperature would drop
low enough to freeze the water in the grapes, but leaving sugar,
acid and flavor extracts unfrozen. When these grapes are pressed
quickly, only the concentrated juice makes its way into the
fermentation tanks. The result is a late-harvest sweet wine
different in style from other German sweet wines.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, wineries in France and California, including
the famous Chateau d'Yquem and Joseph Phelps, have been
experimenting with freezing late-harvest grapes in wine cellars
before pressing them, a process called cryoextraction. The 1996
Eisrebe was made that way.
</P>
<P>
   Cryoextraction may be new, but sweet wines are not. Many of the
wines of ancient Rome are known to have been sweet, and in the 17th
century, when the great vineyards of Bordeaux were still swamps or
cow pastures, the most famous wine in the world was a sweet wine,
Constantia, from the Cape of Good Hope.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest winemakers, including the Greeks, concentrated the
juice in their grapes by spreading the grapes out in the sun on
racks or straw mats until they became like raisins. In Italy, many
wines are still made this way, including Amarone di Valpolicella in
the Veneto, Vin Santo in Tuscany and, in the tradition of sweet
wines going back thousands of years, Recioto di Soave.
</P>
<P>
   The best of these naturally sweet wines are rare and expensive _
a half-bottle of Dolce sells for about $50, but a half-bottle of a
rare TBA can be $500 _ and are certainly not for everyday drinking.
Still, they offer an occasional luxurious experience no wine
enthusiast should miss.

FOOD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS  
 (JT)

<P>
   &UR; Stocks Need Time &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the secret to a flavorful stock? Mine always turn out
watery.
</P>
<P>
   A: Chances are you are not simmering it long enough. Good,
flavorful stocks need hours of gentle cooking in order to encourage
the meats, bones and vegetables to give up their flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Depending upon the stock you are making, be prepared to simmer
it anywhere from one to six hours. Fish and vegetable stocks cook
quickly, chicken stocks fall in the middle, and beef and veal
stocks can cook almost all day for the richest results.
</P>
<P>
   Start by covering the ingredients with two inches of cold water
and slowly bringing the mixture to a simmer. Using cold water is
important. Shirley Corriher, a food scientist, says that if you add
meats and vegetables to hot water, their starches will expand and
gel, which inhibits the release of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Using a variety of vegetables is also essential. Onions, leeks,
garlic, celery and carrots are the standards, but don't limit
yourself. Parsnips add sweetness, mushrooms, an earthy flavor, and
a halved tomato lends richness and an attractive, ruddy color.
Beware of assertive, cruciferous vegetables like cabbage or
broccoli, which can overpower a stock. Parsley and other herbs, a
bay leaf, peppercorns and cloves add nuances.
</P>
<P>
   If you are making a brown stock _ one in which you roast the
bones before simmering _ add some vegetables to the roasting pan.
They will caramelize, and their flavors will intensify. You can
roast vegetables for a vegetable stock, too.
</P>
<P>
   As for salt, add just a little at the beginning (say, a half
teaspoon) to help draw flavor from the vegetables and bones. Before
taking the stockpot off the heat, taste the broth to see if it is
intense enough (add a sprinkling of salt to the spoon). If it
tastes weak, keep simmering until it is rich and flavorful. Then
turn off the heat and stir in salt to taste.

MEDEVAC POLICIES PREVENT BIG BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., Sept. 6)  
 (JT)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sick people should always have medevac insurance,'' in the view
of Dr. John Aldis, a medical officer in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was the man with leukemia who came to China for a
miracle cure he heard about,'' Aldis reported to his fellow health
professionals. ``He got insurance to ship his body back in the
unlikely event that the treatment failed but declined the regular
med-evac insurance. After a few weeks of one medical disaster after
another, he finally decided he wanted to return home. Of course, by
that time his condition was so deteriorated that there was no
possible way for the regular airlines to take him. His `dying wish'
to die at home had to be denied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is always interesting to hear the surprise in their
voice,'' he remarked, ``when I tell tourists that, no, the United
States government will not pay the medevac company the $100,000 for
their return to the United States, or that we can't provide
immunizations they failed to get before they left the States, or
that the Embassy doctor cannot be their personal physician during
their visit to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Aldis was writing to members of the International Society of
Travel Medicine on their e-mail forum. While most of them have seen
exotic medical hazards of travel, Embassy physicians get a
distressingly clear picture of the immediate and disastrous
consequences of travelers' inadequate preparation for health
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend quite a bit of time educating them,'' Aldis wrote,
``about the good and bad of local health resources and correcting
their misinformation about malaria, etc. _ all things a travel
medicine doctor should do before they leave home.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just Aldis, but the whole State Department is making a
particular effort to see that travelers are better briefed
medically for what lies ahead, that they get the immunizations
needed and particularly that elderly, sick or feeble travelers are
cautioned that if they go abroad, they should have sufficient
insurance coverage for hospital treatment or medical evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   A recent message from the Bureau of Consular Affairs of the
State Department outlines the issue, and states in capital letters:
``The Social Security Medicare program does not provide coverage
for hospital or medical costs outside the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Americans are not aware of the vast expense a medical
crisis abroad can entail. Aldis' $100,000 citation is not out of
line; International SOS Assistance in Trevose, Pa., said that it
recently evacuated an American with dengue fever from Thailand at a
cost of $260,000, a record for this company.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman in the State Department said that an American
couple was traveling in the Russian Far East when the wife fell ill
with diphtheria, not rare in the former Soviet Union. The couple
did not have evacuation insurance, and the consulate in Vladivostok
reported that the family had to mortgage its house in the United
States to get the money to pay for medical evacuation to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Two lessons can be drawn here. First, ``Health Information for
International Travel,'' a periodic publication of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, clearly warns of the danger of
diphtheria in the former Soviet Union. The center regularly advises
travelers to renew childhood immunizations because of the
resurgence of such diseases in countries with limited medical
resources. The centers also offer more current information by
fax-on-call at (888) 232-3299; its sheet on the former Soviet area
describes the diphtheria epidemic and counsels booster shots of
tetanus-diphtheria toxoid every 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The second lesson: The couple bought an expensive trip but
balked at the extra cost of trip insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises a question: Should every traveler, including the
young, hale and hearty, buy travel insurance that includes coverage
for medical evacuation? Or only if they are going to the Third
World? A case can be made either way.
</P>
<P>
   A British colleague and his wife barely in their 50s had
evacuation insurance, but it was not particularly on their minds
when they made a trip to Thessaloniki, Greece, where the wife fell
and broke her hip. She was taken by ambulance to a local hospital,
where the doctors wanted to replace her hip. Her physician in
London, reached by phone, counseled against this, and the
assistance service of the insuring company quickly found space on a
plane home for surgery within 72 hours _ not optimal, but soon
enough. The couple said that the whole thing cost the insurer
$10,000, and that they would not travel again without evacuation
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman for a major travel insurance company said that
20 percent of those buying policies beyond the basic
trip-cancellation type wanted medical evacuation and the associated
support services.
</P>
<P>
   If one does take it, how much medevac insurance is enough? John
Knapp, vice president for marketing of International SOS
Assistance, said that usual evacuations by commercial aircraft from
the Far East cost $80,000 to $100,000. Although International SOS
sells medical-insurance services, it is a membership group whose
clients are mainly corporations with overseas offices or employees
who travel extensively. It has no maximum allowance for air
evacuations, and thus its premiums are not affected by the
potential cost.
</P>
<P>
   However, although it sells individual memberships, it has a
different philosophy from an insurance company's, Knapp said: In no
case will it provide benefits for people who are ill when they
start the trip. The traveler who sought help in Beijing would have
been unlikely to have bought this company's services.
</P>
<P>
   According to Beth Godlin, senior vice president of World Access,
which sells the popular Access America trip insurance, 99 percent
of the medical evacuations her company authorizes and pays for
under its basic cruise and tour coverage cost less than $20,000. It
sells policies that cover up to $50,000 in evacuation expenses, and
she said she could not remember any evacuation that cost more than
that. In 1993, an evacuation of an injured hiker from Nepal cost
$50,000. It cost $25,800 to evacuate a comatose woman from Austria
to the United States by air ambulance in late 1996. The trip was
made in two legs with a family member aboard. Insurance paid
$15,000, its maximum; the family paid the rest.
</P>
<P>
   When the traveler has been ill _ ``pre-existing condition'' is
the phrase of art _ it is essential to have insurance that provides
medical evacuation and that includes benefits when the problems are
connected to the illness. This usually means the insurance must be
obtained immediately after a ticket is bought or a deposit for a
trip or cruise is paid.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A New York couple recently bought a Latin American cruise
costing $11,000 each; the Access America policy to cover medical
evacuation and trip cancellation cost $928 a person, with a limit
of $30,000 on medical transportation. The reason such a policy is
so expensive is the rate is tied directly to the cost of the trip.
The trip-cancellation coverage is much more likely to be used than
the evacuation coverage. A ``health only'' Access America policy,
with $10,000 in emergency medical care and $50,000 in evacuation
coverage, plus assistance services by phone, costs $62 a person for
a two-week trip and $82 a person for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers balk at buying travel insurance because of the
cost. Compared with regular life insurance or medical insurance,
the premium is indeed high for the short length of coverage, but
there is no alternative at the moment. Aldis said he had recently
accompanied a group tour of the Silk Road in China where the
travelers, mostly older, said they had been told by their travel
agents to skip travel insurance because it added unnecessarily to
the cost. Dr. Aldis said the lack of coverage increased his and his
wife's anxiety levels considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters often do not authorize evacuations from distant
locales to the lower 48 states, preferring Hong Kong, Alaska,
Puerto Rico or the nearest place suitable medical care is
available. And insurance companies prefer moving patients on
regular commercial aircraft. Even the five or six first-class seats
needed for a patient lying down, a doctor, a nurse and a relative,
plus medical equipment, may be less expensive and safer than a
small plane. But, Knapp said, increasingly U.S. airlines do not
want to accommodate evacuations. In the last year, he said, almost
all of the company's business has gone to non-American carriers,
``because of liability issues and our litigious society,'' although
it may have to do with crowded first-class sections, too. If
non-American carriers follow suit, this shift may affect the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The 210-page government book ``Health Information for
International Travel,'' stock number 017-023-00197-3, costs $20,
shipping included. The most recent issue is dated 1996-97; it will
be heavily revised next year. Mail orders go to Superintendent of
Documents, Post Office Box 371954, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15250. For
credit-card orders, call (202) 512-1800. To receive a faxed index
for ordering this and other CDC publications, including the
diphtheria outbreak in the former Soviet Union (document 300003),
dial (888) 232-3299 on a touch-tone telephone.
</P>
<P>
   The new State Department sheet, ``Medical Information for
Americans Traveling Abroad'' (document 1019), includes a list of
companies that provide air ambulance services, travel assistance
and insurance. Both International SOS and Access America are
listed. Inclusion on the list does not mean that the government
endorses the companies, only that it has dealt with them in
emergencies. To obtain by fax, call (202) 647-3000; or send a
stamped self-addressed business envelope to Office of Overseas
Citizens Service, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Room 4811, Department
of State, Washington, D.C. 20520; on the Web, go to
travel.state.gov/medical.html.

FOR AN EMBARRASSMENT OF SWEET CORN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the third of eight columns by Charlie Palmer, chef and
owner of Aureole in Manhattan. Judith Choate collaborated.) 
(JT) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens every September, if you're lucky enough to have a
garden. The irrational exuberance of spring _ marked by serious
overplanting of fruits and vegetables _ inevitably ends in the glut
of late summer. For some people it's tomatoes or zucchini. For me
it's corn.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many lovers of really good corn, I've pretty much turned
away from the over-sweet varieties that are commercially available
now. With two other chefs, I grow several heirloom varieties in a
garden in Amagansett, N.Y. All of them are wonderful. But in the
end, or rather right about now, it begins to dawn on us that there
is just too much corn.
</P>
<P>
   My mother never found that daunting. I grew up in the farm
country of central New York, and my mother had a well-honed skill
for turning the burden of excess into the joy of variety. I try to
do that, too. With more determination than ever, I've been
combining corn with other vegetables in breads, salads, relishes
and savory stuffings.
</P>
<P>
   But it's when I turn back to an old and very traditional
American recipe, one for corn pudding, that I think I've found this
summer's greatest success. I've devised all sorts of flavorings and
additions, but this combination of musty chanterelles and sharp
Parmesan is, I think, the best. Although I originally created this
pudding as a side dish for pheasant, it can also make a generous
appetizer or a light entree, served with a crisp salad of bitter
greens.
</P>
<P>
   It's so flavorful that it is a very forgiving dish, too. So
never mind all those varieties my friends and I grow in Amagansett.
Use what you've got, as long as it's fresh, and this corn pudding
will turn out beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WARM SWEET CORN PUDDING WITH CHANTERELLES AND SHAVED PARMESAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Time: 1 hour 30 minutes &LR;
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh chanterelles
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons fresh thyme leaves
</P>
<P>
   8 ears fresh corn
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   { cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup Wondra flour
</P>
<P>
   \ teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs fresh thyme, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   { pound Parmigiano Reggiano, in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   1. Using about 1 tablespoon of butter, lightly butter six
6-ounce ramekins, and set aside. Preheat oven to 400 degrees. 2.
Mince \ pound of the chanterelles to make about { cup. In a medium
saute pan over medium heat, melt 2 teaspoons of the butter, and add
the minced chanterelles and { teaspoon of the thyme leaves. Saute
until mushrooms are soft and have released most of their liquid,
about 4 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside. 3. Shuck corn,
and remove silk. Remove kernels by setting the corn upright on a
cutting board and slicing downward with a sharp knife. Set cobs
aside on a plate. Over a shallow bowl, scrape each cob with a small
spoon to remove any remaining corn. Place these scrapings in the
container of a blender or food processor, and add 3 cups of the
corn kernels, reserving the remainder. Puree until smooth. 4. Melt
2 tablespoons of the butter, and place in a medium mixing bowl. Add
the corn puree, egg yolks, half-and-half, remaining corn kernels
and reserved sauteed chanterelles. Whisk in the flour and nutmeg,
and cayenne and salt and pepper to taste. 5. Bring a kettle of
water to the boil. Using an electric mixer, beat egg whites until
soft peaks form. Gently fold egg whites into corn mixture. Spoon
mixture into ramekins, and place ramekins in a baking dish large
enough to allow about 1 inch around each ramekin. Pour in enough
boiling water to come halfway up the sides of the ramekins. Bake
until puddings are golden brown, about 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. While puddings are baking, prepare remaining chanterelles. If
they are large, cut them in half lengthwise. In a large saute pan
over medium heat, melt remaining tablespoon of butter; add shallots
and remaining teaspoon of thyme leaves. Saute until shallots are
translucent, about 2 minutes. Add chanterelles, and saute until
tender, about 3 minutes. Add chicken stock, and season with salt
and pepper to taste. Reduce heat to low, and saute until the
mushrooms are well cooked and silky, about 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. To serve, spoon equal portions of the sauteed chanterelles
onto each of 6 warm plates, reserving a small quantity for garnish.
Run a small sharp knife inside the edge of each ramekin, and unmold
into the center of each plate. Garnish top with a sprig of fresh
thyme inserted into the center and a couple of chanterelles. Using
a cheese shaver, or the slicer on a box grater, shave two or three
very thin slices of Parmigiano Reggiano over the plate. Serve
immediately.

REPLICAS OF WASHINGTON'S FLAG TO GO UP ON SPACE SHUTTLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John Glenn will not be the only symbol of history
on the space shuttle mission this fall. Two modern replicas of
George Washington's personal flag from the Revolutionary War will
be on board.
</P>
<P>
   Once back on Earth, the flags will used in the 1999
commemorations of the 200th anniversary of Washington's death.
Ceremonies are planned at Mount Vernon, the first president's home
in Virginia, and at Valley Forge, the site near Philadelphia where
Washington and his troops spent the bitter winter of 1777-78.
</P>
<P>
   The trip into space for the 2-foot-by-3 foot silk standards was
approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration after
requests from the two historic sites. The shuttle Discovery mission
with 77-year-old Glenn, a Democratic senator from Ohio who was the
first American to orbit the Earth, is scheduled to be launched Oct.
29 and return Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The original flag is displayed at Valley Forge, whose historical
association acquired it from a direct descendant of Washington's
sister, Betty Washington Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was (Washington's) personal emblem as he helped lead the
fight for independence in the Revolution,'' said Mike Quinn,
director of education at Mount Vernon. ``To have it circle the
globe symbolizes his legacy, because representative democracy has
spread around the world in the last 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag has 13 large white stars that cover the background,
which has faded but was apparently what textile specialist Sally
Queen called ``true blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the Washington family tradition that places the flag
with the general during the war ``has proved to be very reliable,''
although ``other documentation is more circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   The replicas are being made by the Washington-area firm of
Queen, a Dallas native who has recreated clothing of Thomas
Jefferson for Colonial Williamsburg and Washington's inaugural suit
for the Bicentennial Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Queen said she and ``a modern-day Betsy Ross,'' Carol Kocian,
are hand-stitching the flag, which is expected to be finished by
the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle flights, in addition to scientific payloads, usually
carry a variety of personal and historical mementoes, some put
aboard by NASA and others by astronauts in what are known as
``personal payload kits.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual items to go aloft was the ashes of Gene
Roddenberry, creator of the ``Star Trek'' series. &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED - The most famous St. Louis Cardinal player was sitting
in the locker room before a big game, doing something he didn't
want the public to know about.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers and reporters could see what he was doing. They
were there to record his every move. It was their job. It was their
duty. It was also 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The great Stan Musial was about to make his final major league
appearance. Among the crowd of press people gathered around him
that day was ``St. Louis Post-Dispatch'' writer Ed Wilks.
</P>
<P>
   The reporter watched as Musial sat in front of his locker,
signing autographs and talking to friends. Then, he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Photographers shifted around him, taking candid shots of the
best-known player in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   `` `You fellows are all my friends,' Stan said. `Don't take any
pictures of me with a cigar in my mouth.'
</P>
<P>
   ``His friends obliged, granting this small request to protect an
image for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   It's accurate, but not exactly true.
</P>
<P>
   The photographers who turned a blind eye toward Musial weren't
only trying ``to protect an image for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   They were protecting grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Children don't need protection. They believe in miracles no
matter what we do or say.
</P>
<P>
   It's different for us. The good faith we're born with grows
thinner and more brittle with time, shattering at the slightest
touch.
</P>
<P>
   I was a kid in 1963. I did not want to know what Stan the Man
did in the Cardinal locker room. Just as my parents didn't want to
know what JFK did behind closed doors at the White House. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fantasy was alive &QL; 
 &QL; 
In those days, adults who knew unflattering details about famous
people didn't often broadcast them or print them. Fantasy was not
yet a banned substance in America. If anything, it was taken daily
by the spoonful to help reality go down.
</P>
<P>
   It's different now. There's no way for us (begin ital) not
(endital) to know about Bill Clinton and the White House intern. No
way (begin ital)not (end ital) to have heard about the bottle of
muscle-building supplements in the locker of St. Louis Cardinal
Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The hulking first baseman is about to break the single season
home run record. But he's using the unpronounceable, and largely
unknown, androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   The substance is legal and not banned in baseball. But it's
prohibited in the National Football League, college sports and the
International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire isn't throwing a shot put or playing defensive end, of
course. But the controversy is enough to shatter the myth.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces continue to fall like rain on the locker room floor.
Every time Big Mac hits another homer, we hear again about the
pills. As he rounds the bases, the shards of a legend crunch
underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way, now, for grown-ups to completely enjoy his
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Although I'm going to try.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the kids or for McGwire, but for me. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Locked in memory &QL; 
 &QL; 
In the World Series of 1960, the New York Yankees with Mantle and
Maris went to a seventh game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The
Yankees set records for runs scored, hits, extra-base hits and team
batting average, winning their three games 16-3, 10-0 and 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth of the seventh game, with the score
tied 9-9, Pirate second baseman Bill Mazeroski, the eighth man in
the lineup, came to bat.
</P>
<P>
   In our neighborhood, about 30 miles north of Pittsburgh's Forbes
Field, grown-ups sat on porches listening to the game on the radio
while kids played in the street.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of the play-by-play announcers was thick around us, as
if the wind itself were broadcasting the game.
</P>
<P>
   With the count one ball and no strikes, Mazeroski hit a high
fastball over the left field wall, causing such a noise from the
adults it frightened us, at first, and convinced us, then and
forever, that miracles happen.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what Maz had in his locker that day, if anything.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to know. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MALTA RIDGE, N.Y. _ As Route 9 shoots southward from Saratoga
Springs, the grand Victorian mansions of the old spa yield to the
familiar outposts of American road culture.
</P>
<P>
   There are gas stations and convenience stores, a vegetable
stand, a lawn-ornament emporium, a drive-in barbecue joint with
picnic tables, and the rusticated cabins of the Thorobred Motel. It
takes a sharp eye to pick out, on the left, the silver diner with
the small rooftop sign: Chez Sophie Bistro.
</P>
<P>
   The motorist who whizzes by in the afternoon is entitled to feel
a twinge of pity. That empty parking lot. That lonely diner. And
just think of the misguided idealists who thought they could sell
French food out in the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   But as dusk approaches, car after car takes a sharp left turn
into Sophie's. By 7, the lot is full, and so is the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   What they have found is a tiny bit of France 3,500 miles from
Paris, the neighborhood bistro that every New Yorker dreams of _
located, unfortunately, in a neighborhood that takes three and a
half hours to reach by car.
</P>
<P>
   Chez Sophie is worth the drive. For nearly 30 years, it has been
serving classic bistro dishes, the kind of deceptively simple food
that, for the French, makes life worth living.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, the menu, printed on a mimeographed sheet of
paper, has scarcely budged. The customers won't let it. They want
the caneton a la Sophie, tender slices of duck breast in a sweetly
piquant apricot and green pepper sauce. They demand the veal
scallops in a cream and lemon sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the Hudson, innkeepers and new-wave restaurateurs
have made giant strides raising the region's culinary standards
over the past decade. But Chez Sophie has been there all along,
with a single cook in the kitchen turning out one flawless dish
after another.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there is a Sophie. She is French, despite her all-American
last name (Parker), and six nights a week she serves 40 to 50 meals
to customers who, in many cases, have eaten at the restaurant more
than 100 times. At the age of 73, she rules over a kitchen staff of
precisely two, not counting the dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Joseph, takes reservations, greets and seats and
keeps the diners happy. Her son, Paul, waits on tables and buys the
food and wine.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Kimberley Comiskey from nearby Malta eat at Sophie's
every Friday night, in the same booth. They have done so ever since
the restaurant moved to the diner about three years ago. That adds
up to more than 150 meals, but the actual total runs much higher,
because they come with friends on other nights and celebrate at
Sophie's on special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the place we compare others to,'' said Ms. Comiskey,
who operates a day spa in Latham. ``It's our benchmark.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker herself makes very limited claims for the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do very simple things, actually,'' she said, seated at a
front booth in her chef whites early one afternoon, before the
day's cooking got under way. ``I don't even think of it as French,
really, I just think of it as good food.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the modesty is understandable. Chez Sophie cruises
along with a set menu of seven appetizers, eight main courses (plus
a fish and pasta of the day), and seven desserts. The wine list
fits on two sides of a piece of typewriter paper: 39 whites on one
side, 38 reds on the other.
</P>
<P>
   There's a nice list of Belgian beers. The appetizers are priced
from $4.50 to $10, the entrees from $21 to $29.
</P>
<P>
   The offerings are pre-nouvelle: country pate, escargots in
butter and garlic, roasted poussin, steak with peppercorn sauce,
chocolate mousse. There are a few contemporary touches, like a veal
chop roasted with portobello and shiitake mushrooms, and quail in a
currant sauce enlivened with balsamic vinegar, but that's as wild
as things get.
</P>
<P>
   Within tight, traditional limits, however, Chez Sophie makes
good on the promise implicit in the name ``bistro.'' The
ingredients are fresh, the flavors pristine, the presentation
unfussy. The thinking behind each dish is crystal clear, and the
food is turned out with a sure hand.
</P>
<P>
   The minimalism is deceptive in any case. The set menu is fleshed
out with specials that take advantage of seasonal local produce,
like the pink, purple and yellow beets that were served as an
appetizer, with a walnut-oil vinaigrette and toasted walnuts.
</P>
<P>
   A good-looking hunk of monkfish came in from the restaurant's
fish supplier in Albany. Mrs. Parker threw slices on the grill
until they were smoky and charred, then served them with sweet
local corn, haricots verts, a red-pepper coulis, and shallot
vinaigrette. After she and her husband picked plump, thumb-size
blackberries from their backyard in Hadley, Mrs. Parker simply
added pureed raspberries and wrapped the fruit in a rich, fragrant
sabayon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the style I grew up with,'' Mrs. Parker said. ``It's
what I'm about, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of Chez Sophie go back to postwar Paris, where
Parker, who had grown up in Astoria, Queens, was studying at the
studio of Fernand Leger after fighting his way across the Pacific
aboard an aircraft carrier.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1946, he and a friend found themselves sharing an
elevator in the Havre-Caumartin Metro station with a rather
attractive young woman. ``Do you speak English?'' Parker asked.
``Sprechen Sie deutsch?'' the woman countered. Parker's friend knew
a little German, and a date was arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Sophie-Leocadia Wilczek (pronounced will-CHECK) was a
21-year-old from Billy-Montigny, a coal-mining town in the Pas de
Calais, near Belgium. Her lack of English at the time proved to be
no barrier to romance. The two married and in 1951 headed off to
the United States, where Parker set up a commercial art studio in
Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parker came from a big family of fine cooks. They raised
their own rabbits and ducks, grew their own herbs and cultivated
their own vegetables. As a little girl, she would run next door to
her Polish grandmother's house and spend all day in the kitchen.
The style was Polish at her grandmother's, French at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never took clients out to eat,'' Parker said. ``I always
took them home, and they'd say, `You know, you could start a
restaurant.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They did. Gripped by what Mrs. Parker calls ``a midlife
crisis,'' the couple bought a former restaurant in Hadley, pop.
850, and moved into the house next door. Mrs. Parker's total
professional training was a six-week apprenticeship with George
Seitz at the Arch Restaurant, then in North Salem, N.Y., and now in
Brewster, to learn how to turn out food in volume. In May 1969,
Chez Sophie opened.
</P>
<P>
   By all normal laws of business, Chez Sophie should have failed.
``The local people said, `If you don't have pizza or spaghetti on
the menu, you'll never make it,' '' Parker said. ``When you told
them you'd be serving ducks and snails, the reaction was `Ugh!'''
</P>
<P>
   Supply lines were shaky. Local wholesalers did not understand
why Mrs. Parker wanted strange lettuces when they could supply her
with all the iceberg she needed. She spent a lot of time explaining
what leeks, endive and arugula were. No one believed her when she
said that she wanted slim green beans, picked before they achieved
full size.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, people didn't know what half the herbs were,''
she said. ``Now, everything has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obstacles, the word got around. Hugo Fiorato, who
conducted with the New York City Ballet at the Saratoga Performing
Arts Center, brought carloads of customers. Alfred Gwynne
Vanderbilt was an early customer. Despite the lack of pizza, others
soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't make a lot of money, but we survived, and we ate
well,'' Mrs. Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Chez Sophie moved around. The Parkers took it
into Saratoga Springs, stayed nearly 10 years, and then moved back
to Hadley. Then, in the early 1990s, Mrs. Parker developed a
fascination with the little stainless-steel diner, vintage 1950.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd pass it on the road, and I'd say, `You know, I think that
diner is smiling at me,''' Mrs. Parker said. It came up for sale,
the Parkers pounced, and on Bastille Day in 1995, Chez Sophie
entered Phase 3 of its long life.
</P>
<P>
   The diner setting feels right. It merges a purely American
concept of budget cuisine with its French equivalent. (An early ad
for the new location read: ``French food, French wine, American
stainless steel'').
</P>
<P>
   Customers can park themselves on a stool at the counter and
order a drink, slip into a booth or walk into the slightly more
formal room in the back, part of an addition to the diner that is
not visible from the road.
</P>
<P>
   The front window seats, with their simple white cafe curtains,
look westward across Route 9 to a broad, grassy meadow. As the
dinner hour proceeds, the sunset puts in a spectacular appearance.
Slate-gray slabs of cloud settle in, lightened by mile-long
brushstrokes of peach light that deepen to a violent red as the sun
drops below the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Chez Sophie is a chummy place. Parker, who has decorated it with
his small metal sculptures of ballet dancers and fencers, works the
room, chatting with regulars and if anyone looks bored, giving them
a notebook full of his cartoons to browse through.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, out of sight, Mrs. Parker sends out the food: a cool,
silken sole and scallop terrine, earthy plates of grilled marinated
portobello mushrooms and eggplant sprinkled with herbs de Provence,
steamed salmon resting on beet greens, surrounded by a puddle of
raspberry coulis.
</P>
<P>
   The dessert moment brings a pecan tart with vanilla ice cream, a
blueberry tart with hazlenut crust, and a house classic, a dense
bread pudding speckled with currants and bathed in a sabayon.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere between the appetizer and the salad _ a perfectly
dressed melange of organic greens _ the idea of eating several
hundred meals at the place seems not only possible but perfectly
reasonable. It all depends on how long Mrs. Parker can keep up the
pace. &QL;

   HERB-MARINATED GRILLED MONKFISH WITH SHERRY WINE VINEGAR
VINAIGRETTE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Sophie Parker, Chez Sophie &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours 25 minutes, including 2 hours marinating time &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 4 to 6 ounce monkfish fillets, all membranes removed
</P>
<P>
   1{ tablespoons plus 1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons coarsely chopped mixed garlic chives and summer
savory, or other herbs of choice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon pure maple syrup (preferably dark amber)
</P>
<P>
   \ cup high-quality Spanish sherry wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   { cup corn oil (do not substitute other vegetable oil)
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons finely chopped shallots
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons finely diced red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and ground white pepper. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the monkfish fillets with
1-1/2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and the garlic chives and
summer savory. Rub the fish well with the oil and herbs, so that
the herbs stick to the fish. Transfer to a covered container and
marinate, refrigerated, for at least 2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. While the fish is marinating, prepare the vinaigrette: In a
medium mixing bowl combine the maple syrup and vinegar. Stir to
dissolve the syrup. Add the corn oil, shallots, red bell pepper,
and salt and black pepper to taste. Refrigerate until serving (may
be prepared a day ahead of time, with improvement in flavor).
</P>
<P>
   3. Prepare a hot grill. Sprinkle the fish with kosher salt and
white pepper. Place on hot grill, and cook for about 3 minutes.
Turn, and grill until the fish is opaque, about 3 to 4 more
minutes. Transfer to a platter and allow to rest for 1 minute. To
serve, slice the fillets diagonally, and arrange on individual
plates. Spoon vinaigrette on top of and around the fish. Serve with
a fresh vegetable, such as haricots verts or sweet corn off the
cob.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings. &QL;

   BLUEBERRY TART WITH HAZELNUT CRUST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Sophie Parker, Chez Sophie Bistro &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 30 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1\ cups whole shelled hazelnuts (available at health food stores
and specialty markets)
</P>
<P>
   { pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   3 cups unbleached all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   2{ to 3 cups fresh blueberries, washed and thoroughly dried
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces currant jelly
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brandy. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spread the hazelnuts on a baking
sheet, and bake until toasted and lightly browned, about 10
minutes. Allow to cool, then rub the nuts by hand to remove the
crisped skins. Discard the skins, and place the nuts in a food
processor. Chop until coarsely ground, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine the butter, sugar,
egg, and vanilla. Mix at low speed just until blended. Add the
ground nuts and all-purpose flour. Mix at medium speed until the
dough forms a ball. Divide the dough into three balls, and cover
two with air-tight plastic wrap to freeze for another use. Press
the remaining dough evenly into the sides and bottom of a fluted
9-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Chill the pan and dough
for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prick the crust all over with a
fork, and bake until golden, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven,
allow to cool, and remove from pan.
</P>
<P>
   4. Arrange fresh berries as close together as possible, in a
single layer over the crust.In a small saucepan, combine the
currant jelly and brandy. Place over medium heat, and reduce to
evaporate the brandy and return the jelly to a thickened
consistancy, about 5 minutes. Brush the tart with jelly until the
berries and gaps between them are well-covered; all the jelly may
not be needed. Serve at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: One 9-inch tart (8 to 10 servings).

 &HT;    CLINTON URGES RUSSIANS TO REJECT 'FAILED POLICIES OF THE PAST'
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-POLITICS-0902.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton on Tuesday urged Russia not to
backslide toward its Soviet past as it struggles to solve a
staggering economic and political crisis that has overshadowed his
summit with President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's financial crisis does not require you to abandon your
march toward freedom and free markets,'' Clinton said in a speech
to Moscow university students. He cautioned against a return to
``failed policies of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton delivered the same message in private talks with Yeltsin
at the Kremlin, opening a two-day summit amid deep concern over
Russia's predicament, White House aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The president brought words of encouragement but no promises of
financial assistance as U.S. officials struggled to assess the
turmoil in Russia and the political outlook for the embattled
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are very much in flux,'' conceded Larry Summers, deputy
treasury secretary and the administration's lead official on global
economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton had hoped his trip to Russia, and to Ireland later in
the week, would boost his image amid the Monica Lewinsky scandal at
home, there seemed little chance of it in Moscow. The battered
Russian economy and the dramatic drop Monday of the U.S. stock
market dominated the day, eclipsing typical U.S.-Russian issues
such as arms control and cooperation in space.
</P>
<P>
   The world's second-largest nuclear power has tumbled toward
economic collapse in recent weeks with the national currency, the
ruble, in free-fall and many of its banks on the verge of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin vowed Tuesday that he would not abandon his commitment
to democratic and market reforms, but the Russian president and his
acting prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, said certain state
economic controls would be necessary to deal with Russia's
financial emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps could include nationalizing banks and some
industries, price controls and printing more money -- which could
spark massive inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard a wide array of voices across the spectrum in
Russian politics say that they are in favor of staying on a
democratic course. Obviously there are very basic disagreements
about what that means in practice,'' Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who fired his government on Aug. 23 and nominated
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister from 1992 until March of this
year, to the post again, has been under intense pressure to resign
as the economy falters.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the summit, Chernomyrdin was soundly rejected by
the opposition-led parliament, leaving Russia without a full-time
government and a plan to salvage its economy. Parliamentary leaders
have vowed to vote and reject Chernomyrdin on a second ballot
perhaps Friday, or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Communists and other opposition parties are using the crisis to
push Yeltsin to give up some of his immense powers and abandon
economic policies introduced after the Soviet Union collapsed in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are enormous. Every choice Russia makes today may
have consequences for years and years to come,'' Clinton said in
his speech at the Moscow State University of International
Relations.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome is critical not only for Russia, but for the world.
Clinton aides said the dramatic dive of U.S. stock market on Monday
was compelling evidence of why Russia needs to fix its problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we like it or not, we must build the future together
because whether we like it or not ... we will be affected by what
you do and you will be affected by what we do,'' Clinton said in
his speech.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were careful to distance Clinton's remarks from
the traditional American support for Yeltsin, who hastened the fall
of communism but is now loathed by most Russians for failing to
deliver on the promised dividends of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Clinton summarized Russia's difficult transition
since the Soviet Union disintegrated seven years ago, but he never
once mentioned Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will meet again with Yeltsin on Wednesday when the two
leaders will sign agreements designed to reduce the nuclear threat.
One agreement would reduce U.S. and Russian stockpiles of
weapons-grade plutonium while the other would create a mechanism
for sharing early-warning data on missile launch tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton aides were non-committal about future financial
assistance for Russia, lacking as it is a full-time government and
an economic crisis plan.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned it will
withhold an installment due later this month as part of a $22.6
billion support package if Russia does not stick to economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow with Clinton, Secretary of State Madeline Albright
said Russia will determine the degree of help from the United
States and other industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody expects the West to keep throwing money into this
country if they are not willing to undertake the fundamental
reforms, so it's a combination of holding out some carrots -- some
money -- and at the same time making clear that there need to be
some fundamental changes,'' Albright said in an interview on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   But White House aides had the air of a group able to do little
in Russia but keep their fingers crossed.
</P>
<P>
   The Reuters news agency reported that a draft document produced
by advisers to Chernomyrdin pointed to greater state control of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Summers told reporters that Russian officials cited to Clinton
``a number of areas in which they felt more active state
involvement was appropriate'' but that this did not mean ``going
backwards toward Communism.''

A GOOD YEAR FOR A FRENCH STEW  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What's more daunting? The long list of ingredients in
a typical recipe for ratatouille or the vowel-clogged French word
itself? Actually, the preparation and the pronunciation share the
same rule: keep the components distinct.
</P>
<P>
   Ra-ta-TOO-ee. Eggplant, zucchini, peppers and tomatoes. Like
each syllable, each ingredient must retain its character.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the early 1960s, when Julia Child sent us shopping for
eggplants to capture a taste of southern France in summer, we
dutifully obeyed the commandment to cook each ingredient separately
before combining them, to avoid the dark, sodden mush that often
gives ratatouille a bad name. Get that down, and you're on your
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a home-style dish so the quantities are not so
important,'' said Jacqueline Zini, who is from Nice and is the
owner of Chez Jacqueline in Greenwich Village. ``At home, I'm not
as fussy about it as I am in the restaurant. I cut the vegetables
in bigger pieces, and if I have a little less zucchini or tomatoes
it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   What does matter is the quality of the ingredients, which is why
this is perfect ratatouille time. Glossy eggplants in every size
and shape are piled at produce stands, zucchini from local farms
are sleek and tender, fresh herbs perfume the air and the tomatoes
are fabulous. Farmers say the lack of rain has made these
vegetables dense and meaty. As for the eggplants, it makes them
less likely to be bitter.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to make ratatouille, a dish whose name derives
from the French verb ``touiller,'' meaning to stir or mix up, is to
saute diced eggplant, zucchini and peppers in succession, then
saute onion and garlic. Tomatoes are then added and once they have
cooked down a bit, the sauteed vegetables are returned to the pan
with some fresh herbs. Don't overdo the tomatoes. They often make
ratatouille soupy.
</P>
<P>
   Once prepared, ratatouille becomes a one-man band. It can be a
hot appetizer, cold appetizer or side dish, or it can fill an
omelet, be used to stuff a fish, wreath rosy slices of lamb or
become a bed for roasted bass or cod. Brendan Walsh, the chef and
owner of The Elms in Ridgefield, Conn., uses ratatouille as a sauce
for pasta. At Astor Restaurant on the Bowery, Scott Snyder bakes it
in a tartlet with goat cheese. And ratatouille soup has long been a
specialty of Soup Kitchen International in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ratatouille even abandons its French accent. At
Pondicherry, Jean-Luc Kiefer interprets it Indian-style, with
cardamom, ginger, chili and fenugreek, while at Tropica, Franck
Deletrain's concept is Caribbean, with the addition of plantains,
chilies and a touch of coconut milk.
</P>
<P>
   However the ratatouille is interpreted, it pays to make plenty.
It freezes well, and it always tastes better the next day.
</P>

   When the New York branch of the Parisian chocolatier La Maison
du Chocolat opened at 73rd Street and Madison Avenue, it was more
like a studio apartment than a maison. But after moving to 1018
Madison Avenue (78th Street), there is now room for a kitchen and a
dining area, which will open on Friday with tables and a coffee
bar, all done in chocolate tones.
</P>
<P>
   The new kitchen has greatly expanded the choice of pastries,
which are made in France and flown to New York, where they are
robed in shimmering chocolate glazes. Pascal Le Gac, who has
created pastries for the company for 19 years, said that many of
his cakes are based on the shop's bonbons.
</P>
<P>
   Bacchus, for example, which is layered with ganache and studded
with rum-soaked raisins, is the store's Bacchus candy writ large.
But the bittersweet chocolate ganache tartlet ($5) is a taste
sensation like none other, a crisp pastry shell cradling an
intense, silken chocolate filling.
</P>
<P>
   The cakes, most of which are in loaf shapes and serve at least
six, are $45. Le Gac says that, refrigerated, they will keep for
two to three days. In the cafe, slices of the cakes and other
pastries, like macaroons, are $5. The shop also has ice creams and
sorbets.
</P>
<P>
   Another confectioner, Black Hound, formerly at Ninth Street and
First Avenue, has also moved to larger quarters, at 170 Second
Avenue (11th Street). Its line of pastries and chocolates are now
on display in an elegant shop trimmed in burnished wood.
</P>
<P>
   A coffee and tea bar has been added for beverages to go, and
there are a few tables in front. A new line of chocolate truffles
flavored with herbs like mint and basil ($32 a pound) is being
introduced. The shop will also deliver. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Yogurt as food of the gods? If the thick, delicious Total
yogurts, imported from Greece by Likitsakos Market, 1174 Lexington
Avenue (81st Street), aren't heavenly enough, the store also makes
its own, in 10 creamy fruit flavors, including fig, blackberry and
applesauce with honey.
</P>
<P>
   The fig, mellowed with honey, is especially good. Total also
makes tzatziki, a dip with cucumber, garlic, olive oil and herbs.
The Total yogurts cost $1.49 for 8 ounces; the tzatziki is $1.99.
The store's yogurts, in 16-ounce containers, are $2.99 to $4.99 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The thought of frozen chicken burgers may not send connoisseurs
into paroxysms of anticipatory delight. But don't sell Natures
Kitchen Chicken Burguettes short. This new product is made from
Murray's chicken that has been coarsely chopped and sliced rather
than ground; it is juicier than the average boneless chicken
breast.
</P>
<P>
   The patties are excellent in sandwiches or on a plate with a
topping of sauteed onions or peppers, perhaps, or even baked with
tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese. They come in four flavors _
plain, portobello mushroom, chili spice and garlic pesto with
sun-dried tomato _ and can be cooked straight from the freezer in a
pan, under a broiler or on a grill.
</P>
<P>
   They have only 150 to 180 calories each, are relatively low in
fat and sodium and contain no additives. A package of four
four-ounce patties is about $4.79 and is now in A&AMP;P, Food Emporium,
Waldbaum's and Morton Williams Associated supermarkets; Fairway,
2127 Broadway (74th Street) and 2328 12th Avenue (132nd Street),
and a number of fancy food shops.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MILTON, N.Y. _ At 2 p.m. on a recent Friday, the orchards at
Locust Grove Farm were enjoying a siesta in the hot midday sun. Not
a farmer was in sight, so I headed up a bluff overlooking the farm
and the Hudson River, and knocked on the door of an old yellow
house.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kent, who was born on the farm 69 years ago, came to the
kitchen door and invited me to join him in a meal from the farm:
ears of corn that had just been picked, juicy red tomatoes and a
slice of his wife's apple pie.
</P>
<P>
   At that very moment, shoppers in New York City's Greenmarkets
were enjoying the same vibrant food from the Kents' farm and from
dozens of other farms in the Hudson Valley. Twenty-five years ago
that sort of experience would have been almost impossible. Until
the first Greenmarket opened in 1976, food in the city came almost
entirely from faraway places _ Florida or California or Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Hudson Valley is once again the breadbasket of New
York, something it hasn't been since the 1930s. The area has
experienced an agricultural renaissance: just two hours away from
17 million people, a network of small farms is producing everything
from cattle to artichokes, peaches to heirloom potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these small enterprises have become so successful that
they have gained national prominence. Hudson Valley Foie Gras in
Ferndale is now the largest producer of foie gras in the world. Its
fattened duck livers are served at the best restaurants in the
country, and just this year the company increased its production to
7,000 livers a week, from 5,500.
</P>
<P>
   Egg Farm Dairy, which started four years ago, opened a new plant
this summer, increasing its capacity ten-fold. It supplies cheese
and butter to specialty markets all over the country, and now
churns as much in a day as it used to in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Other agricultural entrepreneurs are expanding by taking their
companies public or borrowing from private investors. This year
Elizabeth Ryan, for example, used a loan to go from growing apples
and vegetables at Breezy Hill Orchard to opening Hudson Valley
Draft Cider Co. in Clinton Corners.
</P>
<P>
   For many farmers this new lease on life began with the
Greenmarkets and with chefs like Larry Forgione of An American
Place, Waldy Malouf at the Rainbow Room and dozens of others who
made ``organic'' and ``regional'' culinary catchwords. Most Hudson
Valley farmers no longer deal with wholesalers, and instead sell
directly to chefs or at one of the city's 26 Greenmarkets.
</P>
<P>
   While suburbia continues to encroach on the Valley, especially
in lower Duchess County, the market has spurred a new resolve among
farmers and community gropus to retain open spaces in the
mid-Hudson valley.
</P>
<P>
   Just this summer, Scenic Hudson, a preservation group, bought
development rights to approximately 16 percent of the farmland in
the town of Red Hook for $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But farming in the Hudson Valley is very different from what it
was 100, or even 50, years ago. The huge dairy farms that dotted
the landscape continue to disappear. One of the few remaining is
Ronnybrook in Ancramdale, one of the many farms I visited earlier
this summer in a trip through what some describe as the mid-Hudson
Valley: Duchess, Ulster and Columbia counties.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the dairy profitable the Osofsky family, which began
farming here in 1941, has had to adapt. First they put the milk in
glass bottles, a throwback to earlier times that distinguished
their product from everyone else's and permitted them to charge a
higher price. Then they began making premium yogurt, creme fraiche,
butter, fromage blanc and ice cream _ prepared foods that generate
more profit.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Osofsky returned to farming 15 years ago, after 15 years in
corporate finance in New York City. ``I had to make a choice,'' he
said. ``I wasn't enjoying what I was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he cannot explain why he prefers to take care of ``sick
cows and busted machinery'' he suggested that the setting had
something to do with his decision. ``Take a look at the animals,''
he said. ``Take a look at the area.''
</P>
<P>
   It is something to behold. He and brothers own a picture-perfect
farm with black and white cows lying in the distant field and young
children frolicking in the grass with their new puppy. The roads to
the farm are bordered with masses of purple flowers called loose
strife, the nearby fields ripe with corn. ``We are totally enamored
of keeping this countryside the countryside,'' Osofsky said, ``and
one of the ways to do it is to be the breadbasket of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman Greig, on the other hand, is getting out of the milk
business even though it has only been a small part of his family's
farm, which his father started in 1942. ``When my father started
there were 50 dairy farms in this town, now there are two,'' said
Greig, who runs a pick-your-own apple and berry farm in Red Hook.
In November, the 50 cows the Greigs milk will be no more, when the
land is planted with wine grapes that should eventually bring them
much more income than milk.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of pick-your-own farms like the Griegs', part
of a growing push for tourism in the valley. Depending on crops to
make a living is difficult, so many farmers are supplementing their
income by making prepared foods like jams and sauces from what they
grow, activities like berry tastings or special dinners and
children's events like hayrides.
</P>
<P>
   Greig was studying geology when his father called to say he
would have to sell the farm because of ill health. He's not sorry
he came back despite the vagaries of farming. ``It's a very
satisfying lifestyle,'' he said. ``Everything you do is very
tangible. You see your accomplishments on a daily basis and it's a
good place to raise kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is the reason the Migliorelli family moved in 1970 to
Tivoli from the Bronx, , where Ken Migliorelli's grandfather
started raising vegetables in 1933. By 1975 they were growing them
once again. ``We were wholesaling at Hunt's Point and we just
barely eked out a living,'' he said. ``Probably if it wasn't for
the Greenmarket I wouldn't be farming now.''
</P>

   The Hudson Valley has it share of former urban dwellers who,
having made their money, can afford a more bucolic life style.
Stephen Kaye, a tall slim man with a patrician bearing, was a
lawyer in Manhattan before he started raising cattle and growing 18
varieties of potatoes at Lithgow Cottage Farm in Millbrook.
Recently he began raising veal and pigs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I gradually phased into farming fulltime in the mid '80s
because it was my first love,'' he said. ``Farming and land and
horses and growing things and wonderful chefs go together. Once a
week we go into the city to eat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye said he can afford his country life because of real estate
investments, but, ``generally speaking, you can make a living
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye is one of the Valley's many organic farmers. His epiphany
came when he had a pumpkin crop failure on a piece of land that had
no weeds and no worms. ``I knew something was wrong,'' he said as
we sat in his comfortable early 19th century house filled with
antiques.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye's potatoes are much in demand at Alison on Dominick Street,
Picholine, Savoy and Jean Georges; they can also be purchased at
Gourmet Garage, the Vinegar Factory and Fresh Fields. His veal is
going to 20 chefs.
</P>
<P>
   If there are more organic and sustainable agriculture farmers in
the mid-Hudson Valley than in other farming communities it may be
because of the Roxbury Organic Farm and the Hawthorne Valley
School, a kindergarten through 12th grade school that teaches a
whole-earth philosophy as part of the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   David Gardener is a product of both. ``At school we learned that
we must make the land more healthy than when we started,'' he said,
``that you have to ``bend the will of nature instead of trying to
conquer it. '' Gardener spent a year apprenticing at the Roxbury
Farm in Claverick.
</P>
<P>
   In their first year of farming, Gardener and his brother,
Christian, have produced a crop all the experts said could not be
grown in the Hudson Valley _ artichokes. They sold their first
three bushels in half an hour at the St. Marks Greenmarket earlier
this summer and the chef Jean Georges Vongerichten wants four
bushels a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Gardener brothers are making a living by farming a mere
four-and-a-half acres. They are typical of the new kind of farm
that does not require much land. Boutique crops like theirs or like
the eight varieties of garlic at La Terre in Clinton Corners
require much less land than 100 cows.
</P>
<P>
   Direct marketing has made boutique farming viable. It has also
been the salvation for Bob and Alice Messerich of Knoll Krest Farm
who were selling their eggs locally and not getting much for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get $1.70 to $1.80 for my extra-large eggs at the
Greenmarket,'' Bob Messerich said. ``Up here at gas stations they
sell them for 99 cents. Most people here shop price not quality.
They pay 79 cents a pound for their chickens. If I had to sell them
for 79 cents a pound I'd go out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the city line up for the Knoll Krest eggs, not only
because they are so fresh but also because they are have tested to
be salmonella-free. The chickens are housed in clean, uncrowded
conditions that are not conducive to the growth of harmful
bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Even an operation as sophisticated as Millbrook Winery depends
on direct marketing to make it profitable. The best known of the
Hudson Valley wineries it is owned by John Dyson, a former state
agriculture secretary and a man who made his fortune in finance and
insists that the winery be operated like a business.
</P>
<P>
   His wines are found in the city's restaurants and wine shops,
but the reason the vineyard is successful, said Dyson's
brother-in-law David Bova, who runs the place, is ``because we sell
half of our stock through the front door'' to tourists up from the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the future seems rosy for Hudson Valley farmers,
they say they don't feel secure _ and their worries have nothing to
do with the whims of Mother Nature. They worry that their markets,
particularly in New York City, might disappear.
</P>
<P>
   And they worry about the inexorable growth of suburbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a knot in my stomach seeing houses put on this sandy
gravelly soil,'' Ken Migliorelli said. ``They never tear down a
house to put in a farm.'' So he has made certain his farm can never
be a shopping mall. ``We sold our farm to Scenic Hudson,'' he said.
``Now it can never be anything but open space.''

   BEET AND CUCUMBER SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Bois d'arc in Red Hook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8 medium beets
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock or canned chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 medium cucumbers, peeled and seeded
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sour cream
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plain yogurt
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   \ to 1/2 cup whole milk, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint leaves.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel and halve beets, and place in a medium saucepan with
water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until
tender, about 30 to 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Allow beets to cool. Chop roughly, and transfer to a blender.
Add balsamic vinegar, rice wine vinegar, and sugar. Puree until
smooth. Add about half the chicken stock. Puree, gradually adding
more stock until reaching the desired consistency; all the stock
may not be needed. Season to taste with salt and pepper; adjust
vinegars and sugar as desired. Transfer to a covered container, and
refrigerate until serving.
</P>
<P>
   3. Coarsely chop the cucumbers, and place about half in a
blender. Puree, and transfer to a large bowl. Place the remaining
cucumbers in the blender, and add olive oil, sour cream, and
yogurt. Puree until smooth, add to the bowl of pureed cucumbers,
and stir to blend. Add lemon juice, 1 tablespoon at a time, to
taste; all the juice may not be needed. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. If necessary, thin the mixture with milk until the
consistency is similar to the beet portion of the soup. Transfer to
a covered container, and refrigerate until serving.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, use two large ladles or two pitchers to
simultaneously pour the beet portion and cucumber portion of the
soup into a large serving bowl. One side of the bowl will be red,
and the other will be white. Garnish the center of the soup with
chopped mint. Serve immediately, using two small ladles to
distribute individual portions.

   OLD FASHIONED PEACH-RASPBERRY DUFF
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from Larry Forgione
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup apple cider
</P>
<P>
   } cup plus 2/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons quick-cooking tapioca
</P>
<P>
   6 firm, ripe peaches, peeled and cut into medium slices
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons brandy, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   Grated zest of 1 lemon
</P>
<P>
   2 cups fresh raspberries
</P>
<P>
   5 large eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   { cup all-purpose flour, sifted
</P>
<P>
   Confectioners' sugar, for dusting.
</P>
<P>
   1. Butter a shallow 9 x 12 baking dish, and set aside. In a
large sauce pan, combine the apple cider, 1/4 cup water, 3/4 cup of
the sugar, and the tapioca. Bring to a boil, and add the peaches,
brandy, ginger, and lemon zest. Bring back to a boil, reduce heat
to low, and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, and
add the raspberries, stirring to mix. Set aside.
</P>
<P>
   2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Prepare the batter: In the bowl
of an electric mixer, combine the egg yolks and remaining 2/3 cup
of sugar. Beat until thick and pale in color, about 3 to 4 minutes.
Add the vanilla, and beat just to blend; set aside. In another
bowl, use a clean whisk attachment to whisk the egg whites into
soft peaks; do not overbeat. Using a rubber spatula, fold the
sifted flour into the egg whites. Fold the egg white mixture into
the beaten egg yolks.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour the batter evenly over the fruit in the baking dish,
making sure the fruit is completely covered. Bake until golden,
about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle with
confectioners sugar. Serve immediately.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you arrive at Church Street between Franklin and
White in search of 2 Seven 7, you are presented with a number of
choices. There is a restaurant on the corner, lights aglow, but its
sign says ``Arqua.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a set of black french doors set off by tall columns
that looks like the entrance to a boutique under renovation. There
are two shuttered shops. And there is, in fact, a door marked
``277.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people press the button at this last door, but it buzzes
some unfortunate tenant's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Which place is actually 2 Seven 7? The one behind the french
doors.
</P>
<P>
   James Di Zazzo, an owner of this restaurant-of-the-moment,
explained the situation: ``I just chose not to put a sign because
it's kind of cool and it's kind of the vibe of downtown New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a doorman, when no one can find the door?
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed that the city's scene restaurants had worked
all the angles _ from velvet ropes to secret reservation numbers to
exclusive back rooms _ they have come up with another doozy. It is
actually a simple psychological tactic: make something hard to
find, and people, at least Manhattan's voracious scene-seekers,
will want it all the more.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the restaurant in question may offer only so-so
service and mediocre food. Those who manage to find the place are
in the know, and that's all that matters, even if they've stumbled
down a dimly lighted street on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people have. A few of New York's most popular
restaurants, like Chez Es Saada, Moomba and Lot 61, are practically
blank walls facing pavement. Many more display only the tiniest,
most cryptic variations on a sign _ like the banner bearing a
circular symbol that is supposed to lead you to Bond Street, a
sushi restaurant in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   Or the three cream-colored blocks painted with vertical black
bars that mark the entrance to Union Pacific on East 22nd Street, a
restaurant that takes its understated decor seriously.
</P>
<P>
   What could the Union Pacific symbol possibly mean? The
restaurant formerly known as C.T.? Good food here? Believe it or
not, the blocks represent mahjong tiles, and the bars are meant to
be read as the numeral 1 _ 111 is the street address.
</P>
<P>
   Alert the mailman.
</P>
<P>
   Even more esoteric, Blue Ribbon Sushi at 119 Sullivan Street
displays a concrete relief with three kanji, the characters
representing ``Blue Ribbon Sushi'' in Japanese. Which is helpful
for all those people in Manhattan who can read kanji.
</P>
<P>
   At its sister restaurant, Blue Ribbon, the name is painted in
small print on the door, but for a long time, said Eric Bromberg,
an owner, customers thought its name was ``Oysters,'' which is what
the blaring neon sign in the window says. (Experience hasn't moved
Bromberg: his latest restaurant, Blue Ribbon Bakery, has no sign at
all.)
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers are pretty savvy about what's new,'' said Amy
Sacco, the owner of Lot 61, at 550 West 21st Street. ``I think they
like not knowing. There's an element of excitement to not
knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Ms. Sacco's restaurant and lounge, there is what she
describes as a ``stamp'' with the name Lot 61 painted on the wall
outside the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you can't see it,'' she said. ``Nobody ever finds
it.'' Instead, they ask someone at the taxi garage down the street
or at Opera, a nearby nightclub. ``They say they're a directory
service for Lot 61,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the point? Cultivating mystique, after all, can go
only so far. Once you've been to a place, you know its food, its
crowd, its bathrooms. And it is doubtful that you will forget where
it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a marketing ploy more than anything else,'' said
Adam Tihany, the designer of restaurants like Le Cirque 2000 and
Jean Georges. ``Especially in a place like New York, where people
will find any excuse so you can talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be the antidote to the in-your-face approaches you
get at places like Planet Hollywood and the All-Star Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateurs who disdain signage, of course, claim to have a
higher purpose than outright publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Di Zazzo admits that not having a sign at 2 Seven 7 is a hassle
for his customers _ some of them celebrities like John F. Kennedy
Jr. and Amber Valetta. But, he said, ``I do it so they can feel a
little more secure and a little more isolated in New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that raises the obvious question: If that's what
you're after, why go out at all?
</P>
<P>
   At Chez Es Saada, a Moroccan restaurant in the East Village that
blends into a street of town houses, two lanterns hanging near a
black door mark the entrance. The decision not to put out a sign
was philosophical, said Robert McElroy, an owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt that with our location, being tucked away on
First Street, it added to the feel of Morocco,'' he said. ``In
Morocco, you're always wandering down quiet lanes to find things.''
Having to hunt for the restaurant, he said, is supposed to
transport you before you even arrive, assuming you finally do.
</P>
<P>
   Not all restaurants with minimal signs or none at all do it for
esthetic considerations or to exude coolness. Some, like Le Cirque
2000, have to yield to landmark restrictions. Others, like Il Buco,
simply never get around to putting up a sign. And some places just
run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   But very few reasons top those of Antonio Migliaccio, the owner
of Noodle Pudding in Brooklyn Heights. ``Honestly,'' he said, ``I
got embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   So many of his friends nagged him about calling the restaurant
Noodle Pudding that he decided not to hang a sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said everybody coming is going to think it's a Jewish
deli,'' he said. It's not. It's an Italian restaurant, and noodle
pudding is the translation of ``migliaccio.''
</P>
<P>
   Noodle Pudding regulars have begun to warm to its lack of a
sign. New customers sometimes complain. But now Migliaccio is
unshakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the place; it's not a funeral home,'' he said.
``It's got a big huge window out front. What else could it be?''

NOT JUST ANOTHER PATTY: BURGERS OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (fb)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is nothing more American, or more straightforwardly
delicious, than a perfectly grilled hamburger. But at this point in
the grilling season, even the most patriotic of backyard cooks
could be forgiven for wanting to introduce a little variety to the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of giving up on burgers, though, we suggest casting the
culinary net a little wider. After all, it's not as if other
cultures have no ground meat dishes. It's just that they are
usually made from meat other than beef and rarely appear in patty
form. So it makes sense to look to other cuisines for a bit of
burger inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   This approach is quite the opposite from trying to find good
versions of the American hamburger abroad. Overruling the
promptings of common sense, we have sampled everything from
``hamburgesas'' in a restaurant outside Barcelona, Spain, to ``Real
U.S. Burgers'' in a hotel in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Each time, the
results have been appropriate punishment for our slightly
xenophobic impulse to stray from the excellent local cuisines. But
a walk the other way down this culinary street often yields superb
results.
</P>
<P>
   In the small open-air restaurants on the banks of the Mekong
River in Vientianne, Laos, for example, one of the favorite dishes
of relatively well-heeled locals is Mu Pan. These small ground-pork
patties, tingling with chilies and aromatic with lime leaves and
lemon grass, are served with a platter of lettuce leaves for
wrapping and tomatoes for layering. Our friend Pron Savan, a
Laotian-American who is an owner of the Bangkok Restaurant in
Ellsworth, Maine, showed us the standard Laotian method of making
these patties, which involves deep frying, as well as a fair amount
of spice pounding. Back home, however, we found that her
traditional recipe was just as flavorful in pork burger form.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Middle East, lamb is the ground meat of choice.
In the streets of Istanbul, Turkey, for instance, vendors bend over
braziers grilling the many versions of ``kefta,'' ground lamb laced
with cumin, parsley and garlic, and molded into cigar shapes around
skewers. Formed into an American-style lamb burger, these flavors
still work perfectly together.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike pork and lamb, ground turkey has little flavor of its
own. But it does provide an ideal blank canvas for the flavor
footprints of other cuisines. The chipotle peppers, cumin and
cilantro of Mexican cooking, for instance, work wonders with it.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever ground meat you choose, you can enjoy not only a good
meal, but also the comforting feeling that you are helping move an
American culinary institution toward the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   LAOTIAN-STYLE PORK BURGERS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 35 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2 large or 3 small stalks lemon grass
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon good-quality curry powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons minced serrano or other fresh chili pepper of choice
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon grated lime zest
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons roughly chopped fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1{ pounds ground pork
</P>
<P>
   1 egg, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   4 large leaves lettuce of your choice, washed and well dried
</P>
<P>
   4 thin slices vine-ripened tomato (optional).
</P>
<P>
   1. Build a fire in the grill or heat the broiler. Cut off the
bottom quarter-inch of the lemon grass stalks, then remove the soft
inner core from the bottom third of the stalks. Mince this core,
and reserve the remainder of the stalks for another use.
</P>
<P>
   2. In a small bowl, combine the minced lemon grass with the
curry powder, ginger, shallots, chili pepper, lime zest and juice,
cilantro, fish sauce, sugar, salt and white pepper, and mix well.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add the pork and egg, and mix some more, using your hands,
until the mixture has uniform consistency. Form into four rather
thin patties, and grill over a medium hot fire, or broil, until a
peek inside shows that the burgers are just light pink at the
center, 4 to 5 minutes a side.
</P>
<P>
   4. Remove the patties from the heat, place each on a lettuce
leaf, top with a tomato slice if desired, fold the lettuce leaf
over the top and serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS APPROVE DEAL TO BUY REDWOOD FOREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif _ After more than a decade of protests,
lawsuits and back-room deals, the Legislature has sent Gov. Pete
Wilson a measure to buy the Headwaters Forest and two other redwood
groves for $230 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a
state park.
</P>
<P>
   The deal coalesced in the final hours of the Legislature's
two-year session, which ended at 12:40 a.m. Tuesday. It capped
months of near-constant negotiations between Texas financier
Charles Hurwitz, who controls the spectacular forest in Northern
California, and lawmakers in Washington and Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Combined with $250 million already set aside by the federal
government, the Headwaters deal means taxpayers will spend about
$48,000 per acre to buy nearly 10,000 acres of pristine redwood
groves to protect the trees from logging.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers also took a federal deal forged by the Clinton
administration and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and made it
stronger. For 210,000 acres near the Headwaters Forest that will be
logged, lawmakers increased protections near streams where the
endangered coho salmon spawn and agreed to purchase about 2,100
more acres of forest for an additional $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   After nonstop talks Monday with executives of Pacific Lumber
Co., which Hurwitz controls through Houston-based Maxxam Inc., the
state Senate approved the measure by a 29-5 vote Monday night. The
Assembly followed with a 54-12 vote early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Headwaters deal was the last item of the 1997-98 legislative
session. Wilson, who participated in the negotiations, is expected
to sign the measure into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in my view a very good package,'' said Democratic state
Sen. Byron Sher, an environmentalist who forged the final deal with
his chief of staff, Kip Lipper. ``It will give endangered species a
chance for survival, and it gives us a chance to protect these
ancient forests.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Pacific Lumber said the agreement
``represents the last best hope to save the Headwaters. Today, that
hope is one big step closer to being fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   But some environmentalist say the state and federal government
will give Hurwitz $480 million for 10,000 acres of redwood trees
his company probably couldn't log much anyway because of the
Endangered Species Act and other environmental laws.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, a Democrat from Los Angeles, voted
against the measure and said the Legislature was giving one of the
country's wealthiest and most sophisticated financiers money to pay
off junk bond debt, a charge the company has denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extortion!'' yelled Cecelia Lanman, programs director for the
Garberville-based Environmental Protection Information Center, just
moments after the Senate approved the Headwaters bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're right: It is extortion,'' said Sen. Quentin
Kopp, an Independent from San Francisco, who voted against the
bill. ``Boy, the price of poker went up.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal buys an agreement that Pacific Lumber cannot log within
100 feet of large streams where the coho salmon spawn and 30 feet
of smaller tributaries within the 210,000 acres. Then, after a
three-year study of mudslides and erosion, the no-cutting ``buffer
zone'' could be reduced to a minimum of 30 feet or increased to a
maximum 170 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists wanted as much as 300 feet for a buffer zone,
but the federal agreement had only guaranteed 30. Biologists said
buffer zones should be as high as the trees are tall, at least, and
they believe even the added protections approved by the Legislature
on Monday won't be enough to protect the coho salmon from muddied
streams.
</P>
<P>
   The state will spend up to $80 million to buy the 925-acre Owl
Creek Grove of redwood trees, and $20 million to buy the 1,200-acre
Grizzly Creek Grove. These so-called ``lesser cathedrals'' are home
to trees 1,500 years old. About a dozen other lesser cathedrals get
protections for 50 years to save the habitat of the endangered
marbled murrelet bird and other species.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from Humboldt County secured $15 million for economic
aid to the area from lost logging jobs. Another $500,000 goes
toward administering the whole deal.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the measure was passed, environmental groups vowed
to fight the deal in court.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Bundy, also with the Environmental Protection Information
Center, believes the deal weakens federal law by allowing the state
Department of Forestry to approve or disapprove timber harvesting
plans. And he said the deal sets a bad precedent by paying Hurwitz
for the estimated price of the trees, not just the price of the
land.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pope, executive director of the Sierra Club, also said the
agreement did not do enough to stop mudslides near areas where
roads are to be built. Pope, like other environmentalists, was
resigned to the Headwaters deal forged Monday, ``but the crucial
missing element is the safeguarding of our coastal salmon runs and
clean water.''

`MEDITERRANEAN': GOOD STORIES, GOOD FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the years, Paula Wolfert seems to have settled into her
role as a tireless correspondent reporting on the Mediterranean's
complex culinary cultures. Her latest dispatch is ``Mediterranean
Grains and Greens'' (HarperCollins, $27.50), her sixth cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   Like any good correspondent, she tells a good story. There is
the Israeli woman, Samira, who works like an alchemist with her
toolbox of spices assembling tabbouleh salad. (It is more parsley
than bulgur with distinct bellows of cinnamon, cumin and mint, and
it is wonderful if you cut back on the salt a little.) She shares
her discovery, in Anatolia, of an unusual rice pudding thickened
with the starch of wheat berries. And she gives her thoughts on the
pasta-based soups she has tasted or cooked all around the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Her research has led her to many home kitchens, where women in
housedresses shared their secrets. It is a world in which rusks,
bitter greens and farro are a part of the vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   But as I discovered, it is nearly impossible to appreciate this
world without going the extra mile and ordering by mail a few of
the many imported ingredients she calls for. It is one of those
cookbooks in which many of the recipes seem to have one ingredient
you cannot find in your grocery store. And few of the recipes are
for a novice cook.
</P>
<P>
   But once you have rose water, soft shelled wheat berries,
Turkish red pepper and the like, you are well equipped to tackle
Ms. Wolfert's clearly written, tantalizing and utterly delicious
recipes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I couldn't stop cooking from this book. Creamy farro
and chickpea soup is perfectly balanced, a little chewy, a little
starchy and a little sweet. Musbacha _ parsley-tahini-smothered
baby chickpeas from Israel _ is a nutty, garlicky fabulous snack, a
perfect alternative to hummus and easy to make.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb soup with green garlic, leeks and yogurt came out creamy
and tangy with tender lumps of lamb dispersed throughout the white
broth. The garlic soup with leafy greens was brothy and sharp, a
soup to clear your sinuses. It also had a hard, rustic esthetic,
served with a thick slab of country bread and an egg, lightly
poached in the broth, floating in the center of each bowl. All of
these dishes added something to my culinary and taste repertories.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what I liked about this book. For someone who
has not spent her life crisscrossing the Mediterranean, I learned
something on nearly every page.

<P>
   CREAMY FARRO AND CHICKPEA SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``Mediterranean Grains and Greens'' by Paula
Wolfert
</P>
<P>
   Time: 2 hours, plus overnight soaking for farro and chickpeas
</P>
<P>
   } cup dried chickpeas, soaked in water overnight
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon sea salt
</P>
<P>
   2 imported bay leaves
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, plus more for garnish
</P>
<P>
   { cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced celery
</P>
<P>
   } cup farro or hulled barley, rinsed, then soaked in water
overnight
</P>
<P>
   1 quart chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon dried marjoram
</P>
<P>
   2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Freshly chopped flatleaf parsley, for garnish.
</P>
<P>
   1. Drain chickpeas, and place in a medium earthenware pan or
saucepan. Cover with plenty of cold water, and bring to a boil. Add
sea salt and bay leaves. Reduce heat, and cook, covered, until very
soft, about 1{ hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, in a medium saucepan, heat olive oil and gently
cook onion, prosciutto and celery for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until they are soft but not brown. Drain farro, and
add it along with the chicken broth, marjoram and nutmeg to the
onion mixture. Cook, partially covered, for about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   3. Drain chickpeas, reserving the cooking liquid. Discard bay
leaves. In a food processor, puree chickpeas with 1 cup of the
reserved liquid. Add pureed chickpeas to the farro mixture; if
necessary, add more of the cooking liquid from the chickpeas to
achieve the consistency of a creamy soup. Adjust the seasoning with
salt and pepper. Wait 10 minutes before serving, and sprinkle each
portion with chopped parsley and a drizzle of olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

BLUE-RIBBON WINES: THE BEST OF NEW YORK STATE WINNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (fb)  
 By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 1997 Johannisberg riesling made by Chateau
LaFayette Reneau, a boutique winery in Hector, N.Y., on the
southeastern side of Seneca Lake, has been chosen as the No. 1 wine
in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   The wine _ a fruity, $10, semidry Finger Lakes white _ defeated
397 wines to win the 1998 Governor's Cup in a yearly contest
sponsored by the New York Wine and Grape Foundation, a trade
association, and held last Thursday in Canandaigua, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The riesling, sold only in LaFayette Reneau's region, is just
the second one to take top honors in the 12 years that the contest
has been held, said Karyl Hammond, the chairwoman of the contest.
Fifty-five of New York's 100 wineries participated.
</P>
<P>
   Pindar Vineyards in Peconic, N.Y., Long Island's largest winery,
dominated the red wines, taking all of the top prizes. Its 1995
reserve merlot ($19) was chosen as the best red. Close behind were
its 1993 cabernet sauvignon reserve ($19); its 1994 Mythology, a
Bordeaux-style blend ($25), and its 1995 cabernet port ($25), as
well as the 1995 cabernet sauvignon reserve ($19) from Duck Walk,
its sister winery in Water Mill, N.Y., on the South Fork.
</P>
<P>
   The best sparkling wine was deemed the 1991 brut ($15) from
Chateau Frank in Hammondsport, N.Y., on Keuka Lake; the best
dessert wine, the 1997 Fiore Delle Stelle Vidal ice wine from Casa
Larga in Fairport ($25 for a half bottle); the best blush, the 1997
Genundewah blush ($6) from the Arbor Hill Grapery, on Canandaigua
Lake in Naples, N.Y. These wineries lie in the lakes region,
white-wine territory, which has been emerging as the major source
of high-quality German-style riesling in the United States. Local
wineries entered 32 rieslings in the contest, as opposed to 24
chardonnays.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics consider Long Island primarily red-wine territory,
and Pindar's showing tends to confirm a consensus that merlot is
the region's strongest suit. &QL;

YELTSIN PROMISES CLINTON THAT HE WILL CONTINUE ECONOMIC REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Boris Yeltsin assured President Clinton on
Tuesday that Russia will not revert to communism or a state-run
economy to pull out of its economic tailspin, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But Yeltsin alerted the visiting American president that the
Kremlin may soften painful economic reforms in hopes of winning the
Communist Party's support needed to form a new government led by
acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, according to the U.S.
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's commitments were detailed by Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, both
of whom took part in the leaders' 90-minute meeting and lunch on
the first day of a two-day summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin, greeting each other with a bear hug, staged
their ``Bill and Boris'' summit amid unresolved efforts by Yeltsin
to form a new government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton playfully signaled his respect for Yeltsin's political
resilience, squeezing a dense loaf of Russian bread given to him as
a gift and admiring the way the loaf bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing _ kind of like you,'' Clinton joked.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin boasted that ``Russian-American relations are developing
successfully.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is struggling to gain confirmation of Chernomyrdin by
the Duma, the lower-chamber of the legislature, over the opposition
of anti-reform hard liners led by Communist Party chieftain Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin was recalled to duty after the sacking of Prime
Minister Sergei Kiriyenko on Aug. 23 in the wake of the unpopular
devaluation of Russian currency, a freeze on bank repayments of
foreign loans and cessation of Kremlin payments on government
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hinted to Yeltsin that fresh western assistance may
reward continued Russian economic reform, according to Summers and
Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   The two American officials declined to be specific about what
any future aid would consist or where it would come from. They said
any new international aid to Russia would be contingent on
Yeltsin's ability to establish a new government, design a plan for
further economic reform, make the domestic banking system more
transparent and improve tax collections.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said Clinton emphasized the ``strength of the U.S.
commitment to reform in Russia'' during his meeting with Yeltsin.
Summers added: ``There will clearly be a willingness of the
international community to respond as appropriate to Russia's
economic plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton later told faculty and students at Moscow State
University of International Relations that ``if the people of
Russia stand for economic reform that benefits all the people of
this country, America will stand with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, accompanying Clinton,
said the United States will continue ``holding out some carrots _
some money'' to encourage Russians to continue their overhaul of
the Soviet-era economy.
</P>
<P>
   Russian leaders appealed for Clinton to expedite a $4.3 billion
loan from the U.S.-dominated International Monetary Fund (IMF) due
Sept. 15 as part of an 18-month, $22.6 billion bailout approved
earlier this year. U.S. officials made no specific commitment,
according to Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also indicated that Yeltsin has no choice but to
continue the arduous economic reforms that have created massive
unemployment and economic uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   During his well-received, 34-minute address at Moscow State
University, Clinton warned that there were no ``painless
solutions.'' He said he wanted to make that point ``so that you're
not skeptical when your political leaders tell you things that are
hard to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin told Clinton that the Russian
leadership was looking for ways to ease some of the tough loan
restrictions imposed by the IMF, according to Summers and Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said no one had ``any illusions'' that the Russian
transition from communism to free enterprise would ``be smooth or
easy or proceed in a straight line.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to meet on Wednesday with Yeltsin's
political challengers, including the Communist Party leader. The
Communists are pressing Yeltsin to take steps that Clinton has
condemned, including boosting the nation's money supply by printing
more rubles, reviving government control of banks and nationalizing
key industries.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY MAY END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded to Republican critics back home _ led by House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga. _ who have challenged his decision to
hold a summit with Yeltsin amid the nation's economic and political
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that anybody can get on an airplane and take a
trip in good times,'' Clinton told his university audience, adding:
``Friends come to visit each other in challenging and difficult
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Dominici, R-N.M., one of five members of Congress
accompanying Clinton as part of his official delegation, defended
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe when (Russians) have the kind of problems they have,
the best thing you can do is give them some kind of assurance _ the
best you can give _ that we are friends, that we're concerned about
their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., who also accompanied Clinton, said
the Clinton's visit was ``very prudent,'' adding: ``The president
needed to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin struck a pair of agreements to reduce each
nation's stockpile of weapons' grade plutonium by 50 metric tons _
31 percent of the Russian stockpile and 50 percent of the U.S.
stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders also agreed to share early warning information
about long-range missile launches.

TERRIBLE TWOS CAN LEAVE YOU T'D OFF

<TEXT>
<P>
   Could it be the letter T?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Tornado, tempest, thunder, toxic, turbulent, taxes, tests,
threat and termites! See what I mean? T-words! There has to be a
connection. How else can you possibly explain those terrible temper
tantrums from 2-year-olds?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, really, what problems do they have that could upset them
that much? Everything they need is provided free and on demand.
They have special cups with handles and lids that prevent spills.
They have special plates with partitions so the peas don't touch
the applesauce.
</P>
<P>
   Their diapers are designed to draw the moisture away from their
precious little bottoms and make it harder to potty train them
because they don't even know they're wet. Even their transportation
needs are given extra consideration. You can't even take a newborn
home from the hospital if you don't have an approved car seat with
the proper restraints.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a kid, my mother's right arm was my seat belt.
Whenever she had to make an abrupt stop or sudden turn, she'd throw
that bionic limb across my chest to keep me from flying through the
windshield. She still does that when we're riding together, even if
I'm driving. One time she accidentally hit me in the throat and I
couldn't breathe for a few seconds. I'm sure she meant well.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I was standing in line at the toy store the other day
when I heard a blood-curdling scream. In the next aisle, twin boys
were fighting over a package of gum that one had just plucked from
the shelf of temptation conveniently placed within their reach. I
didn't need a birth certificate to tell their ages. Their
vocabulary gave them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine!'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' said the other.
</P>
<P>
   Their poor mother was trying to take the gum and put it back on
the shelf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boys, we have some gum in the car,'' she explained. The boys
went ballistic.
</P>
<P>
   I exchanged a knowing glance with the woman in line behind me.
That mother's logic was in direct conflict with the Toddler
Property Laws, which have appeared in many forms on the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I like it, it's mine. If it's in my hand, it's mine. If I
can take it from you, it's mine. If I had it a little while ago,
it's mine. If it's mine, it must never appear to be yours in any
way. If I'm doing or building something, all the pieces are mine.

   Having ruled out logic, her primary options were: bribe,
threaten or give in and buy the gum. She tried to threaten them
with, ``I'm going to tell your father.'' It didn't work. She tried
bribery. ``If you behave, you can have ice cream when we get
home.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, one of the boys kicked her. That did it. She
dropped the water guns that she was about to purchase and picked up
each boy by his belt. (I think she might be stronger than my mom
because those were some big boys.) Outside, she tossed them into
her Toyota and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Now, is it any coincidence that all this happened on a Tuesday?
I think not.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Imagine if just a portion of world military spending was
redirected toward human development. In 1995, world military
spending totaled nearly $800 billion dollars.
 &HT;    If we channeled just $40 billion of that figure over the next 10
years into antipoverty programs, all of the world's population
would enjoy basic social services, such as education, health care
and nutrition, clean water and sanitation.
 &HT;    Another $40 billion over 10 years would provide all people on
the planet with an income above the poverty line for their country.
 &HT;    Since the end of the Cold War, many industrialized nations have
reduced their defense budgets. As a result, those countries' arms
merchants have turned to new clients in the developing world, where
the majority of today's conflicts take place.
 &HT;    The United States stands as an extreme case. Currently, the
world's only superpower is responsible for 45 percent of all
weapons deliveries in the world. And, in the past four years, 85
percent of U.S. weapons sales have gone to undemocratic governments
in the developing world.
 &HT;    During President Bill Clinton's first term in office, his
administration gave $35.9 billion to the militaries of
non-democratic governments for arms and training _ an average of $9
billion per year. This figure represents 82 percent of the $44
billion in total U.S. military support for developing nations.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, half of the world's governments dedicate more
resources to defense than to health programs. Such distortions in
national budgets contribute to poverty and retard human
development. War, and the preparation for war, is one of the
greatest obstacles to human progress, fostering a vicious cycle of
arms buildups, violence and poverty.
 &HT;    In South Asia, an arms race rages between India and Pakistan,
fueled by a dispute over the Kashmir territory. India spent more
than $12 billion on arms purchases from 1988 to 1992 alone _ more
than either Saudi Arabia or Iraq during the same period. From 1978
to 1991, Pakistan increased its defense budget sevenfold, so that
defense now accounts for nearly 40 percent of all government
spending.
 &HT;    These two nations, which rank alarmingly low on the Human
Development Index, spend exorbitant amounts on this unforgivable
arms race, leaving their people in their own desperate race against
time to merely survive.
 &HT;    In the past few years, two countries in Latin America have taken
historic steps toward ending once and for all the vicious cycle of
poverty and militarism.
 &HT;    Following the restoration of democracy to Panama in 1989 and to
Haiti in 1994, I helped persuade both countries to constitutionally
abolish their national armies, as Costa Rica did in 1949. As a
result, Costa Rica and Panama now enjoy the safest border in the
world.
 &HT;    Furthermore, Haiti, the poorest country in the Western
Hemisphere, may now dedicate more resources to crucial development
needs. These landmark decisions have shown the world that Costa
Rica is not a unique case. The abolition of national armed forces
is truly a viable option for many countries.
 &HT;    Commitments made toward demilitarization in the developing world
must be supported by responsible leadership in the global
community. Yet in several industrialized countries that manufacture
weapons, armament production is viewed as a vital source of
employment and income.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, world leaders must accept the fact that we cannot
let the free market rule the international arms trade. We must not
enrich ourselves through the commerce of death. Rather, we must
realize that the arms trade is most often a friend of dictators and
an enemy of the people.
 &HT;    The time has come to choose human lives over weapons. Indeed, we
must settle at nothing less than a comprehensive, international
effort to regulate and monitor arms transfers.
 &HT;    Toward this end, I convened a meeting this spring with seven
other Nobel Peace laureates _ Elie Wiesel, the Dalai Lama, Jose
Ramos-Horta, Betty Williams, and the directors of American Friends
Service Committee, Amnesty International and International
Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War _ to publicly unveil
an International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers.
 &HT;    This Code is also fully endorsed by eight more Nobel Peace
laureates: Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Lech Walesa, Rigoberta Menchu,
Adolfo Perez Esquivel, Mairead Maguire, Norman Borlaug, Joseph
Rotblat and this year's winner, Jody Williams. Furthermore, former
President Jimmy Carter has expressed his strong support for the
Code of Conduct.
 &HT;    This International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers would
prevent undemocratic governments from building sophisticated
arsenals. Governments that systematically abuse internationally
recognized human rights through practices such as torture or
arbitrary executions would not receive military training.
 &HT;    Countries that commit genocide would not be able to buy
munitions. Governments engaged in armed aggression against other
countries or peoples could not buy missiles. States that support
terrorism would be prevented from acquiring weapons.
 &HT;    In addition, all nations would be required to report their arms
purchases to the United Nations. This Code of Conduct would
undeniably promote global security and protect human rights.
 &HT;    Current initiatives to restrict arms sales in the United States
and the European Union represent a first step toward our mission
for peace. Earlier this year, owing to back-room dealings and
political tricks, a U.S. Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers failed
to pass a joint House and Senate Conference Committee.
Nevertheless, its strong showing was indicative of the Code's moral
sway and great promise.
 &HT;    Across the Atlantic, Belgium and the United Kingdom have taken
the lead in promoting a comparable European version.
 &HT;    Some might question the Code's relationship to the free-market
concept of supply and demand. If a country's leaders want arms,
some might ask, who are we to say that they shouldn't have them?
 &HT;    First, since the end of the Cold War, arms manufacturers have
been aggressively promoting sales to the developing world in order
to compensate for the drastic reduction in arms purchases by most
industrialized countries. Furthermore, when we assert that a
``nation'' desires arms, to whom exactly are we referring?
 &HT;    (ital) Is the single mother in Indonesia or the street orphan in
Egypt pressuring government leaders to buy tanks and missiles? Or
is it a dictator _ who sees arms purchases as the only way to
maintain power? (end ital) The poor of the world are crying out for
schools and doctors, not guns and generals.
 &HT;    Another argument posited to justify the sale of arms is that, if
one country does not sell arms to a nation that wishes to buy them,
someone else will. That is precisely why all weapons-selling
nations must agree to certain common restrictions.
 &HT;    We can no longer say business is business and turn a blind eye
to the poverty and oppression caused by arms transfers. Just like
slavery and the drug trade, the arms trade reaps profits tainted
with blood.

 &HT;    CLINTON TO MEET WITH COMMUNIST LEADER AMID POLITICAL CRISIS
 &HT;    With RUSSIA-CLINTON-0902.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Amid Russia's deep political and economic troubles,
President Clinton sets out Wednesday on a detour from his summit
with the politically enfeebled Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will hold talks with the Communist Party leader and a
host of possible Yeltsin successors, meetings which seemed design
to hedge America's bets if Yeltsin should fall as a result of the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will hold talks with Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the
Communist bloc in the lower house of parliament and Yeltsin's chief
antagonist. He will also meet former army general Alexander Lebed,
now governor of the sprawling Krasnoyarsk region, Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov and Grigory Yavlinsky, head of liberal opposition Yabloko
party -- all likely candidate's for Yeltsin's job.
</P>
<P>
   In any foreign trip, White House officials generally fan out for
talks with a broad spectrum of political and business leaders. For
instance, Clinton aides met Tuesday with Boris Berezovsky, a media
and banking mogul -- one of Russia's so-called oligarchs -- who is
widely credited with engineering the Aug. 23 firing of the previous
government and seeking the return of Viktor Chernomyrdin as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's chaos puts emphasis on Clinton's meetings
Wednesday. Yeltsin is under pressure to resign and the
Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the Duma, has vowed
to continue blocking his choice for prime minister, Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   The Duma, which rejected Chernomyrdin in a confirmation vote on
Monday, may vote again as early as Friday. The impasse could lead
to weeks of more political uncertainty while the Russian economic
crisis rages on. A third rejection of Yeltsin's nominee would force
early parliamentary elections -- and pose a threat to both the
Kremlin and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's stupid to fight over the controls of a falling plane,''
said the daily Rossiskaya Gazeta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov said he would ``tell the U.S. president about what is
going on in Russia. The timing of the visit has been excellently
chosen. Let him see what he and Yeltsin have done to the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Yeltsin a ``hard drinking and demoralized person who
is profaning the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard rhetoric comes from democracy-loving Russians, too.
Yavlinsky said Clinton and the West should have abandoned Yeltsin
long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are partly to blame for the chaos. You carried on praising
Yeltsin, supporting his robber economy, refusing to see how corrupt
his power was,'' he told Western reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin was already dismally low in opinion polls before the
economic crisis hit Russia last month.
</P>
<P>
   Now, long lines have formed outside banks as Russians seek to
withdraw their savings. And if Russians needed further confirmation
of the withering value of their rubles, Moscow's subway system
raised the price of a token by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks as if the Communist opposition may be more inclined
to go to extremes now,'' said first deputy Duma speaker Vladimir
Ryzkhov, a Chernomyrdin ally. ``They seem keen to try and topple
Yeltsin's regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin have vowed not to retreat in the
face of the Duma opposition and lack of public confidence.
Chernomyrdin said he would assemble a cabinet and an
economic-crisis plan despite his lack of confirmation by the Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov responded: ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to
a civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian news media have reported that the Kremlin was prepared
to use force in the power struggle with the parliament, prompting
the head of the country's internal security agency, the FSB, a
successor to the Soviet-era KGB, to go on television to calm
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is expecting or preparing such methods to resolve the
country's problems, nobody,'' he said.

COLLEGE BOARD NOTES IMPROVEMENT IN MATH SCORES ON SAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ College-bound students who took the SAT test
showed improvements in math but made no gains in reading and
writing, the College Board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board, which oversees Scholastic Assessment Test,
said that while more minorities took the SAT exam and advanced
placement tests in 1998, scores of black and Hispanic students
continued to trail whites and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's college-bound class typifies the growing challenge
to higher education,'' said Donald M. Stewart, president of the
College Board. ``We see a significant increase in the number of
well-prepared students, but we also see more students with
insufficient academic preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The mean SAT math score was 512, the highest in 27 years and 1
point above last year's level. The mean SAT verbal score is 505,
the same as last year and 6 points above the record lows of 1991
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest math and verbal scores among ethnic groups nationwide
were those of African Americans, who scored 434 in verbal and 426
in math. By comparison, Hispanics scored 461 in verbal and 466 in
math; whites 526 in verbal and 528 in math; and Asians 498 in
verbal and 562 in math. A perfect combined score is 1600.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low scores among African Americans are attributable to a
number of factors,'' said Stanford University education professor
Martin Carnoy. ``You must look at the income level of the family
and education level of parents. Also, studies have shown that
African Americans have a negative psychological feeling toward
taking tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores for Hispanic students actually fell between 1997 and
1998. The mean verbal score for Hispanics fell 5 points, while the
mean math score for Hispanics fell 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   Other indicators for minority students are more upbeat. Between
1988 and 1998, the percentage of blacks taking the SAT rose from 50
percent to 59 percent. For Hispanics, the number went from 55
percent in 1988 to 63 percent this year. The number of minority
students taking the SAT is also steadily rising.
</P>
<P>
   This year, students whose first language is not English
comprised 8 percent of the 1.2 million taking the test, up from 5
percent 10 years ago. The proportion whose first language is not
English is much greater among Hispanic groups and their mean SAT
verbal scores are much lower than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can point to increased math and science study as a reason
for the current high in the average math score,'' Stewart said.
``But the rock-steady verbal scores are more difficult to explain.
One factor may be the decline in familiarity with English.''
</P>
<P>
   The College Board report also showed that SAT scores in the
suburbs were above the national average and on the rise, while
scores in urban and rural areas continued to drop below that
average.
</P>
<P>
   The state with the highest mean scores is Iowa. The lowest
scores were in South Carolina and the District of Columbia.

`THE MUSEUM GUARD': IN A WORD, A NOVEL THAT'S FRAUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The year is 1938, a time of Hitlerian menace, but the troubles
of Europe seem far away from Halifax, Nova Scotia, where DeFoe
Russet, the narrator of Howard Norman's deftly mysterious new
novel, is a museum guard.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Europe far away, but in addition everything about
DeFoe's world seems constrained by smallness, a smallness of
ambition, an aimlessness that is itself a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   DeFoe, though young, bright and all-seeing, is planning to be a
museum guard all his life, standing in Room C of the Margaret Glace
Memorial Museum with its view of the Halifax harbor, assiduously
warning visitors not to get too close to the paintings.
</P>
<P>
   But Europe is closer than one might imagine, and limitations of
vision are swept away in ``The Museum Guard,'' in which Europe's
looming public madness is incarnated in the private sphere in a
blind drive toward psychological destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's book starts out quietly and inexorably expands _ to
what exactly is not easy to summarize. Early on, the story seems to
be about the cruelty of a love engineered by a teasing sort of
temptress.
</P>
<P>
   It then shifts to madness, as the woman DeFoe loves mistakes
herself for a figure in one of the paintings he guards. Then the
tale shifts to an allegory of moral responsibility, a passion play
about the fateful dangers of misguided good intentions, which may
be disguised forms of possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Museum Guard'' seems at times to bend and groan under all
its thematic weight. Even allowing for a strong element of
allegory, the story also stretches the bounds of psychological
plausibility.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard, whose previous novel was the much-acclaimed ``Bird
Artist,'' is one of the more interestingly enigmatic writers around
these days. His new novel fairly glimmers with the originality of
his complexly tragic vision.
</P>
<P>
   DeFoe is a subtle creation, a fine combination of
self-effacement and perceptiveness whose life, we soon learn, has
been shadowed by disaster almost from the beginning. He works
alongside his uncle, a drunken, irreverent womanizer named Edward.
He has a girlfriend named Imogen Linny, who torments him with the
inconsistency of her affections.
</P>
<P>
   Imogen seems at first to be merely eccentrically self-absorbed,
like a little girl who lectures sternly to her teddy bear. When the
overeager DeFoe asks if he can hear a phrase she has been
contemplating, she tells him: ``You may, but you have to listen
carefully. It's just one sentence, but it's got a lot of parts to
it. `Life is made up of dramas of the soul's estrangement and
reconciliation.' My God, it is deeply complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFoe is a figure acquainted with grief. His parents died when a
zeppelin crashed in the Halifax fairgrounds in 1921, when he was 8,
and he has been raised by the roguish Edward, who also got him his
job at the museum.
</P>
<P>
   DeFoe tells how he met Imogen, who is the caretaker of the
Halifax Jewish cemetery, and then how she tortures him, first with
erratic self-absorption and later, more painfully, with her
flirtatious behavior toward Uncle Edward. An exhibition of Dutch
paintings organized by the museum's director, Connaught, hangs in
Room C, and one painting, ``Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam,'' by a
contemporary Dutch artist named Joop Heijman, soon exercises a
strange hold on Imogen's mind.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the coming European catastrophe enters the lives of
the dramatis personae via the radio broadcasts of a certain Ovid
Lamartine, who issues stark warnings about the curtain of darkness
that is about to fall on Europe. When Lamartine, to Edward's
delight, visits Halifax to give a public lecture, a calamity on the
scale of the 1921 zeppelin accident imposes itself.
</P>
<P>
   A mad violence descends, and when two other figures in the
story, Connaught and his lover, Helen Delbo, the museum tour guide,
undertake a scheme to rescue Imogen from her intensifying but
somehow seductive insanity, the result is breathtaking in its
perversity.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the scheme _ that Connaught should take Imogen to
Amsterdam to be confronted by Heijman _ is far-fetched enough to
strain credulity. It is not merely that Imogen seems unworthy of
the mighty efforts being made on her behalf, and that there seems
to be no reason for the scheme to have its desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   It is also that these efforts to rescue Imogen from herself are
made by people whose interest in her is unexplained and therefore
inexplicable. Still, the denouement, which involves the Amsterdam
painter Heijman and Imogen's conviction that she is the figure
portrayed in ``Jewess on a Street in Amsterdam,'' has a Gothic
power, a power intensified by the very leanness and clarity of
Howard's prose.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, DeFoe, whose quiet intelligence begins to
distinguish him from just about everybody else in this story, tries
to dissuade Imogen's friends from their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at Miss Delbo. `Please don't do this,' I said.
</P>
<P>
   `` `You can't help whom you love,' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left the Hotel Wyatt.''
</P>
<P>
   When Connaught sees Heijman (whose wife has been killed by the
Nazis while visiting Germany), the realization of his and Ms.
Delbo's mistake descends on him with Sophoclean force: ``And,
Helen,'' he writes to Ms. Delbo, ``as I spoke, as I looked into
this kind, tormented face, this soul besieged by grief, I realized
with the abruptness of a heart attack that to have facilitated
Imogen's desire to be in Amsterdam was more than some perverse
declaration of empathy on our part _ it was doom-filled.''
</P>
<P>
   The sense of doom as a portent, the way it provokes what the
damaged and therefore damaging Imogen calls the soul's
estrangement, is what stays in the mind after reading Howard's
strange, flawed and affecting novel. &QL;

NOVELIST TIM O'BRIEN PURSUES `EMOTIONAL TRUTH' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Mass.)   (bl)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORTHINGTON, Minn. _ Tim O'Brien entered the Mystic Lake Casino
with the agitated assurance of a man who belonged there. He pulled
a wad of $100 bills from his tennis shorts, strode to the
$200-minimum-bet blackjack table and within minutes, maybe three
cigarettes into a long night, was playing with $2,000 of the
casino's money.
</P>
<P>
   This was just outside Minneapolis, three hours northeast of
Worthington, the town where he grew up, where he traveled the next
day on not enough sleep. Emboldened by his good fortune, he began
raising his wagers _ to $600, then $800 _ and over the next hour
went up another grand.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop him from grumbling over every unfelicitous
card, however, and at last the dealer, a stoic young woman, uttered
her first mirthless words. ``My God,'' she said. ``What would you
be like if you were losing?''
</P>
<P>
   To which O'Brien, a novelist celebrated for airing the consuming
obsessions of soldiers and jilted lovers, replied with a grin,
``The same.''
</P>
<P>
   At 52, O'Brien is on a roll, even if he doesn't always show it
with the grace of someone accustomed to good luck. His last novel,
``In the Lake of the Woods,'' a dark and penetrating tale about a
politician, haunted by his days in Vietnam, who may or may not have
murdered his wife, was selected by The New York Times Book Review
as one of the best books of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when it was finished, he was so emotionally drained he swore
off novel-writing; on the book tour, he broke down in the middle of
a reading in Ann Arbor, Mich. This was concurrent with the collapse
of both a marriage and the love affair that ruined it,
circumstances that precipitated his very public disclosure of his
own contemplation of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   So he doesn't suffer contentment easily. But now he has a new
novel, ``Tomcat in Love'' (Broadway Books), and a private life that
at long last seems to be stabilized. Still, like a lot of gamblers,
he has a hard time letting well enough alone, and it's almost a
surprise to hear him admit, warily, to a bout with good cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a happy person now,'' he said, sounding a little surprised
himself, then backtracking a bit. ``Getting there. Maybe the world
isn't the horrid place it seemed to me four years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this was the beginning of a particularly good week for
him, visiting his family in the Midwest from his home in Cambridge,
Mass., where he has lived since he returned from the Vietnam War
and went to graduate school in government at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   That day he had gone golfing with his brother in the Minneapolis
suburbs and visited the casino, and the next morning, traveling
with his girlfriend of two years, drama teacher Meredith Baker, he
drove to visit his parents in Worthington, on the relentless
flatlands near the borders of Iowa and South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   A town of 10,000 in the middle of soybean fields that once had
so many turkey farms it billed itself as the turkey capital of the
world, Worthington is now not quite so distinguished. Squeezed
between an interstate highway and a pretty lake, it can seem grim
or tranquil, depending on the corner you're viewing it from. The
ubiquitous strip of fast-food joints is particularly repellent
here.
</P>
<P>
   But out of its view, meandering along leafy streets in a rented
car, O'Brien, the eldest of three children of parents who met in
the Navy during World War II, recalled a happy American childhood.
He pointed out the ballfields he had played on; the schools where
he had received, he said, a first-rate education; the golf course
where, at age 8, he had set up a lemonade stand. He also pointed
out the meat packing plant where he worked the summer after
graduating from Macalester College in St. Paul. This was another
kind of memory; he had just been drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worthington shows up in all my books, in one way or another,''
O'Brien said. ``There are pretty spots, and a subdued, genteel
civility. But beneath it all I find an insularity, a
holier-than-thou feel to it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Worthington I object to, it's the kind of place it
is. The not knowing anything and not tolerating any dissent, that's
what gets to me. These people sent me to Vietnam, and they didn't
know the first thing about it. They didn't know the French had been
there. They couldn't find it on a map.''
</P>
<P>
   He cursed, then shuddered, aware of his agitation. This is a man
who isn't quite satisfied without ambivalence. ``In the new book, I
mock the place relentlessly,'' he said. ``But it's mockery with a
kind of love.''
</P>
<P>
   A short, stocky man who wears a baseball cap to hide his
baldness, O'Brien has deep-set, worried eyes. He is a chain smoker,
a weight lifter, a writer who agonizes over sentences in order to
derive pleasure from them, a man who lives with tension and the
habits of tension release. By nature he is a confessor, a
scab-scratcher, a ceaseless self-examiner.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly the writer in him; in his work, in search of
``emotional truth, which is what fiction is about,'' he has often
blurred the line between autobiography and storytelling, even
naming characters after himself; when he gives readings, he often
begins by recounting one of his stories as though it really
happened, then confessing he made it up. But it is also partly the
man.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really true is not a philosophical thing; it's a
plaguing thing,'' he said. ``What does somebody really think? Does
she really love you? And if she says she does, to what degree? If
you stop loving someone, did you ever love them? If you say you're
committed and later you're not committed, well, was the first thing
commitment? You see what I mean? This kind of thing has always
interested me.''
</P>
<P>
   The new book is a skewed visit to his dark side. A savage comedy
about a blithely sexist but strangely naive man who is obsessed
with the woman who leaves him, ``Tomcat in Love'' is the author's
effort to set his love troubles at a distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love, as wonderful and horrible as it is, has at its center a
kind of pitiful humor,'' he said. ``The things we will do to be
loved are tragic, yes. We'll go to war to be loved, and we'll lie
to be loved. But we'll also do the most ridiculous stupid things,
stand outside dormitories all night long hoping by some chance
she's got to go to the library. It's incredibly painful at the
time, but in retrospect really, really ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a terrible time in 1994, and I wanted to look
back on it through a lens of humor,'' he added. And indeed, he
said, writing the book made him giggle. But it didn't quite settle
his heart. In an interview, talking about the events of 1994 after
vowing to himself he would not do so, he broke into sobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to protect the people I love,'' he said. ``They had to
go through hell, and it was my own fault, and I don't want to put
them through it again. It's like going to war again.''
</P>
<P>
   For readers of O'Brien's past work, that's a particularly
telling analogy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can the foot soldier teach anything important about war,
having been there?'' he wrote in his first book, ``If I Die in a
Combat Zone,'' a nonfiction account of his year in Vietnam. ``I
think not. He can tell war stories.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't have been more prescient. Since then, his novels,
including ``Northern Lights''; ``Going After Cacciato,'' which won
the National Book Award in 1979, ``The Nuclear Age'' and ``In the
Lake of the Woods,'' and the short story collection ``The Things
They Carried,'' which The Times Book Review called ``one of the
finest books, fact or fiction, written about the Vietnam War,''
have all had soldiers at the center, either living through the war
or their memories of it.
</P>
<P>
   He's the one Vietnam novelist who has continued to chronicle the
soldier's experience as it recedes in time; his recurring dream, he
said, is that the war is still going on, and that he has been
drafted again, unable to convince the draft board that he has
already served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I'm obsessed by the war,'' he said. ``I feel as
a survivor of cancer might feel; it's been gone a long time and I
know it's not coming back. I am obsessed by things like: Did I do
the right thing then? How would I behave now? I'm obsessed by
things like cigarettes, and by writing itself. I'm obsessed by my
fingers on those keys. I'm obsessed by regularity of habit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1994, on assignment from The New York Times Magazine,
that he went back to Vietnam for the first time. Writing of his
trip, taken with the woman for whom he had left his wife, he
reported that she had left him upon their return and was living
with another man.
</P>
<P>
   In the article, titled ``The Vietnam in Me,'' he wrote: ``Last
night suicide was on my mind. Not whether, but how. Tonight it will
be on my mind again.'' And he went on to equate the horror of war
with the horror of heartache. ``You don't have to be in Nam to be
in Nam,'' he wrote. It was an astonishing bit of self-revelation,
widely discussed, criticized as both embarrassing and courageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I wrote it, but I wish I hadn't published it,'' he
said. ``It's a perceptive piece, about the inner penetration of
love and war, and eerie, uncanny similarities between the two. But
it hurt people I love, and probably me too, a little. Though it
saved my life, in one way. It was written moment by moment. Should
I jump off the balcony or not? I'd literally leave the typewriter
and go to the balcony, and think about jumping off and go back and
type another sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomcat in Love'' is daring in another way. Picaresque in its
plotting and hyperbolic in the neuroses besetting its characters,
the book is wickedly unkind to both men and women as they persist
in misunderstanding and manipulating one another. Once again it
defies the reader to find the author in it, but departing from the
pattern in his war stories, where a character's fear and foibles
draw the reader's natural sympathy, this time O'Brien is cutting
closer to ignobility.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist and narrator, Thomas Chippering, is a
6-foot-6-inch linguistics professor _ and, no surprise, a Vietnam
veteran _ with flowery diction and absurdly high self-regard. He is
a deluded man who, as he plots to win back his faithless wife,
continues to solicit the attention of other women. Though he rarely
beds them, he keeps a diary, recording every favorable look or
comment he receives, a scorecard, of sorts, of his desirability. In
sum, he sins mightily in thought, though rather ordinarily in deed.
One question the book asks is: How bad a guy is he?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid some people are going to say that Chippering is
such a sexist pig that O'Brien must be one,'' the author said. ``I
think I'm a pretty moral guy, a very moral guy, but I'm not
perfect. How am I not perfect? I like girls. But I think this is a
feminist novel. I'm mocking this guy, and he's not a stick figure.
He's a living, dynamic guy. He makes a lot of the mistakes I've
made, but at the same time I'm laughing at him.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, point taken; Chippering is not O'Brien. But that was too
easy. He wasn't dancing close enough to the flame. ``My friend Les
called me up and said to me, `Well, the chicks aren't going to like
it.''' O'Brien recalled. His eyes lighted up and he added, ``It's
the word `chicks' I like.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he giggled, just as he had the night before, at the casino,
when, after pausing to decide whether to just let a good thing be
good, he pushed forward a final bet _ $1,000. And won.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year, more Americans attend arts events than sports
events. So somebody is making money, yet artists themselves
continue to struggle. As evidence, just take a walk through New
York's Soho and note how many former artists' lofts have become
doctors' condos. Given the moralizing that has strangled government
financing of the arts, and the fickleness of many private
foundations, things look pretty bad. It's enough to make an artist
want to return to the days of private patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, an enlightened, wealthy patron who believes in your work,
supports you without reservation and expects nothing more than an
occasional dedication. It's a nice fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the artist-patron relationship historically has seldom
been so benign. Haydn's patron Prince Esterhazy was really an
employer, who revered Haydn as a composer but expected him to be
the musical equivalent of a servant. Beethoven was downright surly
with many of his patrons but got away with it because everyone
sensed that they were dealing with a colossal genius. Wagner was
extravagantly courteous to his patron, the mentally unstable Prince
Ludwig of Bavaria, who nursed a barely concealed sexual attraction
to the composer. Wagner manipulated him cannily, extracting money,
gifts and, ultimately, a made-to-order opera house.
</P>
<P>
   But surely the strangest and saddest composer-patron
relationship was that of Tchaikovsky and his devoted patron,
Nadezhda von Meck. A wealthy widow when she first contacted the
composer by letter in late 1876, von Meck supported him with an
annual stipend of 6,000 rubles. The relationship lasted for 14
years and allowed Tchaikovsky to quit the job he hated, teaching at
the Moscow Conservatory. Truly, Tchaikovsky would have not become
Tchaikovsky without von Meck's assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their relationship was like some odd phantom marriage. They
exchanged long, involved letters; over 500 survive, and there were
no doubt hundreds more. Yet they purposely never met, even when
they were both staying at von Meck's vacation estate in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   This much-written-about relationship was vividly depicted
recently in an unusual program that was part of the Bard Music
Festival's look at ``Tchaikovsky and His World.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, conceived by Marina Kostalevsky, who teaches
Russian literature and culture at Bard, and directed by Elise
Thoron, presented two costumed actors, David Beach, who portrayed
Tchaikovsky, and Lynne McCollough, who portrayed von Meck, reading
from the letters and diaries.
</P>
<P>
   Now and then, works referred to in the letters were performed,
like Tchaikovsky's wistful Waltz in F minor for piano, or the
Adagio from Mozart's String Quintet in G minor, a work that
Tchaikovsky adored but von Meck was bored by.
</P>
<P>
   The letters are remarkable: elaborate outpourings, by turns
revealing and guarded, clearheaded and convoluted. The result was
an affecting dramatization of the bond between unlikely soul mates.
</P>
<P>
   Von Meck was born in 1831, making her nine years older than
Tchaikovsky, and had been married at 16 to a Russified German
engineer who became a railroad tycoon. By the time her husband
died, just months before von Meck first wrote Tchaikovsky, she had
given birth, impressively, to 18 children, 11 of whom survived.
Music was her passion, and she played the piano fairly well, it
would seem, given the home sight-reading sessions she describes in
her letters. Von Meck was a well-read, cultured, multilingual woman
who inveighed against the institution of marriage. Who could blame
her?
</P>
<P>
   Having heard of Tchaikovsky's financial struggles, and having
been deeply stirred by a performance of his tone poem for orchestra
``The Tempest,'' she wrote to him, graciously requesting some
chamber music compositions and offering generous fees.
</P>
<P>
   Though deeply flattered, Tchaikovsky was uneasy about the
financial tension that was the subtext of their early
correspondence. But he soon got over it. ``You are the only person
in the world whom I am not ashamed to ask for money,'' he wrote
her. ``First, you are very kind and generous; second, you are
rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Tchaikovsky entered into his regrettable
marriage of convenience with Antonina Milyukova. He seems to have
actually believed that she understood there was to be no physical
element to their relationship. When he realized this was not the
case, his distress caused a near nervous breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Von Meck surely must have heard the talk of Tchaikovsky's
homosexuality. But she interpreted passionate love between men as
an ``understandable sentimental excess,'' in the words of the
Tchaikovsky biographer Alexander Poznansky. And for her an actual
sexual act between men ``was so impossible to imagine,'' Poznansky
writes, ``that the physiological component in any such union could
be ignored altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   This suited Tchaikovsky, who referred to his disastrous personal
life in code, calling himself ``flabby'' and ``weak'' and
``pitiful.'' Von Meck guarded this epistolary union like a jealous
spouse. ``The thought of you with that woman was unbearable,'' she
wrote, after learning of the quick breakup of his marriage. ``I
hated her because she did not make you happy; but I would have
hated her 100 times more if she had.''
</P>
<P>
   They implicitly agreed never to meet in person. ``My ideal man
is a musician,'' she wrote. But ``I am afraid to meet you; I don't
think I would be able to say anything to you.'' Tchaikovsky
replied: ``You are afraid not to find in me those qualities which
your idealizing-inclined imagination has attributed to me. And you
are quite right.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So the relationship continued beneficially for both. Von Meck
must have been an astute judge of new music, for when in 1879 she
hired a young French musician who had recently graduated from the
conservatory in Paris to give music lessons to her children, she
told Tchaikovsky all about how wonderfully gifted a composer her
dear ``Bussy,'' as she called him, was.
</P>
<P>
   The composer was Debussy, not yet 17. One of the most rewarding
performances in the Bard event was of a movement from the lyrical,
undulant and sweetly harmonic piano trio that the teen-age Debussy
composed while staying with von Meck.
</P>
<P>
   She also made Debussy play with her the piano four-hand
arrangement of Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony, which the composer
had dedicated to ``my special friend,'' von Meck.
</P>
<P>
   And this work, too, was performed compellingly at Bard, by the
pianists Diane Walsh and Todd Crow. Without the distraction, in a
sense, of Tchaikovsky's beguiling orchestration, the tensile
strength and ingenious structure of this music came through
resoundingly.
</P>
<P>
   That Tchaikovsky considered von Meck an intellectual equal is
attested to by the vigor with which he debated artistic matters
with her. When in one letter she compared the sensory pleasure of
listening to music with that of drinking fine sherry, Tchaikovsky
vehemently objected. ``Music is not deception but revelation,'' he
wrote. ``It is not a physiological phenomenon.'' And when he wrote
to her with some guarded praise of Wagner, von Meck retorted: ``How
can Wagner with his realism be compared to you? He is a profaner of
art, admittedly a talented one.''
</P>
<P>
   The correspondence broke off, suddenly and mysteriously, in
1890. Reporting that she was bankrupt, von Meck wrote to
Tchaikovsky with regrets that she would have to discontinue her
annual support. But he learned that the bankruptcy story was
apparently untrue, and when he wrote to her for clarification she
did not reply. Von Meck may never have received this letter.
Scholars disagree about what happened. In any event, before his
death, Tchaikovsky attempted to repair the relationship, and died
in 1893, at 53, believing he had done so. Von Meck died the next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bard festival event, the extensiveness of this amazing
correspondence was reflected in the length of the program, which,
even with some scheduled pieces cut at the last minute, took over
three hours. Yet few in the audience left, for the story of this
relationship, a sort of culturally high-minded co-dependency, was
so poignant, fascinating and weird.
</P>
<P>
   And, for composers today, it is certainly a cautionary tale
about the intricate workings of patronage.

PUSHING FOR THE TALE OF A TINY BOY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Calif. _ Mark Steven Johnson, a screenwriter best
known for his hit pictures ``Grumpy Old Men'' and ``Grumpier Old
Men,'' recalls the months he spent traipsing from studio to studio
to pitch the idea of adapting a portion of the John Irving novel
``A Prayer for Owen Meany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Try pitching that movie,'' said the 33-year-old writer.
``Studio executives asked what it's about, and I said it's kind of
about a tiny boy who believes he's an instrument of God and
accidentally kills someone he loves with a foul ball and then
realizes everything happens for a reason. There was always a real
long silence that followed. And they finally said, `How's about
doing another `Grumpy Old Men?'''
</P>
<P>
   He persisted. His efforts paid off in ``Simon Birch,'' one of
the more idiosyncratic studio films in years and one that goes
against the grain of the high-tech, big budget,
assault-on-the-senses extravaganzas whose plots are generally
summed up in a line or less. The film, written and directed by
Johnson, is to be released on Sept. 11 after an ambitious marketing
campaign by Walt Disney Studios, which clearly has hopes that the
movie, as oddball as it is, will emerge as an unexpected success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to market; it's not easy to execute,'' said Joe
Roth, studio chairman. ``But it's a shot you take. In the worst
case, it's a wonderful movie that the company should be proud of.
In the best case, it's a sleeper hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving saw the film in late August on a visit to Los Angeles. He
said in a phone interview that he had agreed to sell his 1989 novel
after reading Johnson's adaptation, but with the proviso that the
movie not use the novel's title. The novel involved the
speculativeness of religion and miracles, the Vietnam War and a
quirky little boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story was significantly different from the story of the
novel and it would be unfair to my readers to mislead them to think
they'll see `A Prayer for Owen Meany,''' Irving said. ``It's not `A
Prayer for Owen Meany,' but I liked it. And I'm happy with the way
I was treated.''
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the film involves the friendship of two boys, Joe
and Simon. Joe is played by 14-year-old Joseph Mazzello (``Jurassic
Park,'' ``The River Wild'') and Simon by Ian Michael Smith, 11, who
has Morquio's syndrome, a genetic disorder that results in
dwarfism. The destinies of the two boys are linked as both seek to
find what's missing in their lives: Joe wants to find the identity
of his father and Simon wants to wants to find a special purpose
for his life, since doctors proclaimed his birth a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   Ian, who lives in Elmhurst, Ill., was found in a casting call.
The cast also includes Ashley Judd, Oliver Platt, David Straitharn
and Jim Carrey in a noncomic role; he narrates the movie and plays
the grown-up Joe. (In the novel, but not the film, the Carrey
character is eccentric and deranged, furious about the Vietnam
War.)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he remembered finishing the novel for the first
time at 3 o'clock one morning. ``I woke my wife up and said, `This
is what I want to direct,''' he said. ``The book just wiped me out.
I had never read a story like this. For one thing, the characters
were the most interesting, quirky, absurd people. And the book
dealt with faith and predestination and God. You don't read about
these subjects in novels'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   His enthusiasm drew the attention of two producers, Laurence
Mark and Roger Birnbaum, who eventually joined forces and
shepherded the project through Disney. Of his first meeting with
Johnson, Mark said: ``About two years ago I asked him if there was
anything in his top drawer that he'd been dying to do but no one
had expressed interest in. He said, `Absolutely, ``A Prayer for
Owen Meany.''' From that moment on, we worked out how we would do
it and be true to the spirit of the book and yet have it be a
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Birnbaum, head of Caravan Pictures, which had a deal at Disney,
joined Mark. ``It was emotional, it was funny, it was sad,''
Birnbaum said. ``It was very affecting. And that's what you want
movies to do.'' Roth soon agreed to make it for the relatively
modest $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that the film is offbeat and untraditional
studio fare, Roth noted that hugely successful films as diverse as
``Rain Man'' and ``Forrest Gump'' were not especially easy to
characterize. ``They turned out to be very centrist movies,'' he
said. The studio is following almost to the letter the campaign it
waged for ``Mr. Holland's Opus,'' the 1995 sleeper hit in which
Richard Dreyfuss played a high school music teacher who looks back
on his life. That film grossed about $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Roth said the September opening for ``Simon Birch'' was selected
because that is a relatively slow time, after the release of the
major summer movies but before studios unload their fall and winter
films.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson acknowledged his nervousness about the audience
reaction, but added: ``Lots of people have come up to me after
seeing the movie and said the same thing, `It's such a relief to
see ``Simon Birch'' after a lot of the movies this summer.' People
said they forgot how to think. Let's hope they want to be
challenged.''

DISNEY'S ASIAN SECRET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the Walt Disney Co. calls someone the Walt
Disney of Japan, maybe animation fans ought to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   The animation giant is talking about Hayao Miyazaki, nine of
whose animated films from the past two decades it will release in
American video markets or theaters in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The first one, ``Kiki's Delivery Service,'' hit video stores
Tuesday and features Miyazaki's wonderful animation style and a
flight of narrative fancy that's perfect for children yet still
engaging for adults.
</P>
<P>
   The film was a big Japanese hit, something Miyazaki has a habit
of making.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Princess Mononoke,'' which Disney subsidiary Miramax plans
to release in theaters next year, has grossed at least $150 million
so far, second only to ``Titanic'' in Japanese box-office history.
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki also created ``My Neighbor Totoro,'' another highly
recommended children's film infused with magical beasts and
striking art that has been available on video in the United States
since 1994, selling half a million copies so far. Rights to
distribute ``Totoro'' also will revert to Disney from 20th Century
Fox under the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miyazaki is a pioneer and a visionary who can take a story and
bring it brilliantly to light through phenomenal animation and
imagery,'' said Michael Johnson, president of Disney subsidiary
Buena Vista Home Entertainment Worldwide. Johnson championed the
deal at Disney after seeing a Miyazaki film several years ago in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know animation,'' Johnson said. ``When I first saw
Miyazaki's films, I wanted to find a way to make them available
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kiki'' follows a 13-year-old witch as she leaves her family
for a year of training on her own in a big city in a universe
somewhat like ours, but not quite.
</P>
<P>
   In it, dirigibles and early TVs, Clipper ships and double-decker
prop planes, '40s-era cars and quill pens all combine to give the
film a slightly disorienting, if pleasing alternate-world feel.
That feel is further heightened by Miyazaki's lifelike style,
reminiscent of the Tintin series and some recent French comic book
artists.
</P>
<P>
   To revoice the film for American audiences, Buena Vista brought
in a name-brand American cast, including young actress Kirsten
Dunst as Kiki, the late Phil Hartman as her wisecracking cat and
Janeane Garofalo as an artist friend.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion to English isn't total however. Written credits
and some minor details in the film itself are in Japanese, though
in other places, signs in German, English and other languages
contribute to the tale's overall dislocation of reality.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Japanese animation, or anime, Miyazaki's work is
much slower, quieter and sweeter. Like ``Totoro,'' the 104-minute
``Kiki'' is long for an animated feature and sometimes feels like
it, given its deliberate pacing. But Miyazaki's films contain many
charms, as quirky fantasy bumps up gently against slices of average
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``His films are truly universal and timeless in their appeal,''
Johnson said. ``They transcend cultural borders, and I know of
animators everywhere who speak of his influence on their work.''
</P>
<P>
   Miyazaki, who personally draws thousands of each film's frames
of animation, is a stunning visual artist. For instance, one of
``Kiki's'' stars is the gorgeous European-looking city in which it
is largely set, replete with a dazzling clock tower and
mansard-roofed buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Other tours de force are a sequence with a flock of Canadian
geese, his handling of wind and water, and an accident involving
the helium-filled dirigible.
</P>
<P>
   Disney has ambitious plans for Miyazaki's films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to take `Kiki's Delivery Service' and have it
transcend the anime category by packaging and marketing it
differently so that it reaches a much wider audience, beginning
with families,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   But securing the deal with Miyazaki took almost as long as
creating one of Miyazaki's films. He had been courted by other
studios in the past but had resisted deals because of concerns
about preserving his films' artistic integrity, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Miyazaki's deal, Disney's own name won't appear
explicitly anywhere in connection with his films. Subsidiaries
Buena Vista and Miramax will handle the video and theatrical
releases.
</P>
<P>
   The films themselves won't be cut or otherwise modified, except
for the addition of top-flight American casts. For ``Mononoke,''
which updates a 14th-century Japanese fable, the company has signed
Gillian Anderson, Claire Danes and Minnie Driver for character
voices, Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really view these films as masterpieces and don't want to
take too many liberties with them,'' said Johnson. ``There are
moments of reflection in there that are often missing in American
films. Many Disney animators idolize him.''

WILL TEXAS PICK TWO GOVERNORS IN ONE ELECTION?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This might be remembered as the year Texas
elected two governors.
</P>
<P>
   It is a scenario that some political analysts say should be
taken seriously: Popular Gov. George W. Bush easily wins
re-election, setting the stage for a presidential bid in 2000; then
a nation eager for new direction after eight sometimes scandalous
years of the Clinton administration catapults the affable Texan
with the familiar name into the White House.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the winner of the Nov. 3 lieutenant governor's
race between Democrat John Sharp and Republican Rick Perry could
move into the Governor's Mansion on or before Jan. 20, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Texas history is replete with examples of lieutenant governors
replacing governors who were ailing, died or left office, according
to the Texas Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
   The state's first lieutenant governor, Albert Clinton Horton,
was also the first to move up. Just 18 days after he took office in
1846, Horton became acting governor because Gov. James P. Henderson
took a leave to fight in the Mexican War. Horton returned the reins
of state government to Henderson some 13 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other lieutenant governors have followed similar paths to
the governor's office. Four others were elected governor after
serving in the No. 2 job.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Clark, the state's seventh lieutenant governor, had the
distinction of replacing Texas icon Sam Houston, who was elected
governor in 1859 but resigned in 1861 after refusing to swear
allegiance to the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   When the Civil War ended four years later, Lt. Gov. Fletcher
Stockdale performed some duties as governor after Gov. Pendleton
Murrah refused to swear loyalty to the newly reconstituted Union.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. William P. Hobby Sr. became governor in 1917 to replace
Gov. James E. ``Pa'' Ferguson, who was impeached on corruption
charges. Hobby, whose son William Jr. served as lieutenant governor
from 1973 until 1991, was elected governor in his own right and
served until 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Texas Constitution, the lieutenant governor presides
over the Senate and leads the Legislative Budget Board, which has
the power to adjust the state's spending priorities when the
Legislature is not in session.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Bush says he's concentrating solely on winning
his second term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   But with polls showing him with a lead of 50-plus percentage
points over Democrat Garry Mauro, the governor has had ample time
to stump on behalf of fellow Republicans _ and perhaps collect
chits for a presidential bid _ in such faraway states as Michigan
and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   All that has put this year's race for lieutenant governor in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, a two-term state comptroller, and Perry, a two-term
agriculture commissioner, are raising record amounts of money, and
polls forecast a race that will be nail-biting tight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lieutenant governor's race is by far the most
interesting race on the ballot,'' said Bryan Eppstein, a GOP
strategist from Fort Worth who is not involved in the race. ``No.
1, it's going to be the closest race in the state. No. 2, aside
from Governor Bush, this race has the best candidate in the state
that each party has to offer. And No. 3, this race will define who
will be the next governor of Texas regardless of whether George
Bush runs for president.''
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the contest will succeed retiring Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock, a Democrat who made all Senate committee appointments and
controlled the flow of legislation through that body during his
eight-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates say they are not running with the idea that they
might occupy the Governor's Mansion two years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you told me, `I'll appoint you as governor or I'll appoint
you as lieutenant governor,' I can tell you in all honesty that
I'll take lieutenant governor,'' Sharp said. ``And the reason is
the lieutenant governor has a lot more to do with whatever talents
I have than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry often describes himself as a ``friend and political
soulmate'' of Bush, indicating that the ideology emanating from the
governor's office would not change if Bush were to ascend to the
White House. But no one in the Perry camp is looking past Election
Day 1998, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick is focused on winning on November 3,'' said Ray Sullivan,
Perry's spokesman. ``Just as Governor Bush is focused on winning
re-election. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   But James Riddlesperger, a political science professor at Texas
Christian University in Fort Worth, said the movers and shakers are
keenly aware of what might be at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons this (lieutenant governor's) race is so
interesting is that if Bush does seek the presidency and win _ and
that is not a far-fetched scenario by any means _ we're electing
the next governor,'' Riddlesperger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties know that.''

TREASURY CUTS MINIMUM FOR INVESTORS IN BILLS, NOTES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - With the stock market on a roller-coaster ride, plenty
of investors are looking for the investment equivalent of a
merry-go round.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Sam might have the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time for the market meltdown, the U.S. Treasury has
lowered the minimum investments on Treasury bills and notes and
announced more options for buying those securities and their sister
Treasury bonds directly from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury securities, which are issued to run the federal
government, are attractive because they provide regular income
(free of state and local taxes) and are considered ultra-safe. The
government, unlike corporations or cities, can print more money if
times turn tough, so there is virtually no risk of default.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a good feeling in owning those,'' said Wendell
Garrett of J.W. Garrett and Co., a Phoenix brokerage. ``We have a
number of clients who always want a certain percentage (of their
accounts) in Treasuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The government wants more people to get the feeling. Last month,
it lowered the minimum investment on Treasury bills _ short-term
investments akin to certificates of deposit _ to $1,000 from
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum on two-year Treasury notes _ similar to a
longer-term CD _ was reduced to $1,000 from $5,000. Longer-term
T-notes and Treasury bonds had $1,000 minimums.
</P>
<P>
   The minimums apply to Treasuries bought directly from the
government, either through its Treasury Direct program or at a
Federal Reserve Bank or branch. The latter isn't much of an option
for Arizona residents, as the closest branch is in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of people on fixed incomes, it'll open it up to
them,'' said Laurie Moore, a certified financial planner in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   An account can be set up through the mail or online. Beginning
next month, Treasury Direct customers can buy the investments
online at the Bureau of Public Debt's Web site,
www.publicdebt.treas.gov. In late October, investors will be able
to buy them via touch-tone telephone (800-943-6834). In both cases
the money is automatically withdrawn from the buyer's bank account.
Interest payments are directly deposited.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of buying direct are the low minimums and lack of
fees. Banks and brokerages charge fees to buy Treasuries for
customers, and often have hefty minimums. Bank of America, for
example, charges a $55 fee for T-bill purchases under $50,000, and
the minimum purchase is $10,000. Fees, however small, can make a
difference when you're talking about yields in the 5 percent
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the lower minimums, Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin said it's part of an effort to ``seek innovative ways to
encourage all Americans to save and invest.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some drawbacks to buying direct, some financial
planners say.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Treasuries investors purchase are in a different
account from the rest of their investments. This creates additional
paperwork and record-keeping. Customers who buy them through a bank
or brokerage, for example, will have them included on a statement
with the rest of their investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes clumsy,'' said Keith Wibel, president of Foothills
Asset Management in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said the whole process of buying can be confusing, with
an array of forms and auctions and maturities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy thing to do,'' he said. ``I don't think it'll
affect our clients much. They want us to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   So investment experts say buying Treasuries direct, like buying
stocks without a broker, is best for do-it-yourself investors.
</P>
<P>
   Even though yields are at historic lows, Wibel thinks certain
Treasuries are a good buy now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inflation is low and, in my view is likely to stay low, so the
real return is still above historic averages,'' Wibel said.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how he and others say investors can use the different
types of Treasuries:
</P>
<P>
   _ T-bills: An alternative to bank accounts, certificates of
deposit and money-market accounts. T-bill rates _ 5.05 percent to
5.10 percent last week depending on the maturity _ are slightly
higher in most cases than other ultraconservative rivals,
especially given the low minimums and the tax benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A T-bill is good for someone who may need cash in a short
period of time,'' said Tom Connelly, a certified financial planner
with Keats, Connelly &AMP; Associates in Phoenix. For example, they may
appeal to people who know they have a tax bill due next April and
don't want to risk the money they've set aside for it.
</P>
<P>
   _ T-notes: Good for medium-term savings. The rates last week
ranged from 5.10 percent for a two-year note to 5.20 percent for a
10-year note. Investors could park cash for a car or other
big-ticket purchase they see down the road.
</P>
<P>
   Moore builds them into clients' retirement portfolios, timing
the maturity with their retirement date. The interest payments kick
in when the paychecks stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although interest rates may fluctuate (which pushes the value
of the bond up or down) if you hold them to maturity there will not
be a loss of principal,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate fluctuation could be a benefit. If interest
rates fall, the value of the bond rises, giving you capital
appreciation in addition to the interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They might be good in an overall portfolio just to have
something that could appreciate if interest rates were to go
down,'' Connelly said.
</P>
<P>
   _ T-bonds: Many planners recommend small investors stay away
from longer-term bonds, especially those coming due in 30 years,
because they are more volatile yet yield only slightly more than
shorter-term Treasuries. For example, 30-year bonds pay about 5.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In ``such a low interest-rate environment, I haven't been
putting people in long-term things,'' Moore said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TREASURIES &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QC; 
Investor primer on securities &QL; 
The alphabet soup of Treasury securities is easily confusing to
investors, especially beginners. The investments are all in the
same family, but the name changes depending on the maturity.
</P>

 &HT;    SHAKY MARKET WILL SLOW SOCIAL SECURITY, TAX REFORMS, EXPERTS SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This summer's volatile stock market will slow the
push to partly privatize Social Security and doom any chance that
Congress will enact a significant tax cut this session, economists
predicted Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Monday's) crash will put the advocates of
privatization on the defensive, to put it mildly,'' said Robert
Litan, director of economic studies for the Brookings Institution.
``And there isn't enough time in the congressional calendar to
worry about tax cuts. They just want to get out of town'' in
anticipation of the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   Declining stock prices increase the problems of conservatives
who want to partially privatize Social Security. A steadily rising
market had bolstered proposals to invest part of the payroll tax in
stocks and bonds, and perhaps even set up individual retirement
accounts that workers could control.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's partial recovery in stock prices, the steep
decline in recent days ``injects a bit of realism,'' said Dean
Baker, an analyst with Economic Policy Institute, a research group
opposed to privatization. In the runaway bull market of the past
decade or so, he said, many Americans thought that stock prices
``just go up. Some years you got 10 percent return, and some years
you got 20. The Social Security system was competing against
unrealistic expectations, and it was hard to defend the existing
system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a very good reminder that what goes up can come
down,'' said Wendell Primus, an economist for the Center on Budget
and Policy Priorities. ``It isn't going isn't going to doom
privatization. But it serves as very useful reminder that
retirement security'' must include ``a guaranteed lifetime annuity
that doesn't go up and down with market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If this volatility continues, we have a harder battle in front
of us,'' said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the Heritage
Foundation and a supporter of privatization. ``It preys on people's
fears. People do crave security.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``privatizers'' must educate the public that even if the Dow
falls from its July peak of over 9,300 to 6,000, they would still
be better off than with traditional Social Security, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the fluctuation) kills the idea by any means,''
said Barry Bosworth, a Brookings Institution economist. ``From the
Social Security perspective, the good news'' is that stock
volatility ``will lead to more rational discussion'' about
privatization, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The market's swings changes the politics of a number of other
issues as Congress returns for a busy month before a scheduled Oct.
9 adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   Projected budget surpluses are the foundation for Republican
tax-cutting plans and Democratic hopes for increased spending on
education, health care and other social programs. But if a shaky
stock market is an indicator of economic weakness _ and perhaps a
looming recession _ those surpluses might never materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the big budget picture, it all depends on whether this is a
correction or the start of a sustained decline indicating an
economic downturn,'' said Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation. ``If
it's a downturn, it would be bad for tax cuts, but we would be more
worried about recession and people losing jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock roller-coaster ride has left politicians, as well as
investors, unsure of what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what will happen?'' said Norman Ornstein, a
political analyst with the American Enterprise Institute. ``None of
us do.''
</P>
<P>
   The unsteady market may help avoid another government shutdown
as President Clinton and the Republicans who control Congress
negotiate over the 13 appropriations bills that fund government
operations. Economic fears could spur compromise in a political
season.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the White House sex scandal, Clinton's good standing with
the populace is based on his perceived competence _ especially in
maintaining a booming economy. His popularity could plummet if the
stock market goes bust.
</P>
<P>
   However, congressional incumbents of both parties are also
claiming credit for the country's good times. If those times seem
threatened, shutting down the government may raise unacceptable
political risks for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the political arena, Wall Street's worries may help
congressional Republicans by heading off a potentially divisive
battle between the party's Senate moderates who favor fiscal
restraint and House conservatives who wanted to make a big tax cut
the centerpiece of the fall campaign, said Ornstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax cut wasn't going to happen anyhow,'' he said. But
there will be less pressure from conservatives with a gyrating
stock market clouding forecasts of future budget surpluses.

in one day?
</P>
<P>
   ALFRED: I get up early.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER: Didn't you promise to behave?
</P>
<P>
   STUDENT: Yes, sir.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER: And didn't i promise to punish you if you didn't?
</P>
<P>
   STUDENT: Yes, sir, but since I broke my promise, you didn't have
to keep yours.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER: Tommy, why do you always get so dirty?
</P>
<P>
   TOMMY: Well, I'm a lot closer to the ground then you are.
</P>
<P>
   HAROLD: Teacher, would you punish me for something I didn't do?
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER: Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   HAROLD: Good, because I didn't do my homework.
</P>
<P>
   TEACHER: I hope I didn't see you looking at Don's paper.
</P>
<P>
   DON: I hope you didn't either.
</P>
<P>
   GARY: I don't think I deserve a zero on this test.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TEACHER: Well, at least there's one thing I can say about your

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The toilet is blocked and we cannot bathe the children until it
is cleared.
</P>
<P>
   This is to let you know that there is a smell coming from the
man next door.
</P>
<P>
   The toilet seat is cracked: where do I stand?
</P>
<P>
   I request your permission to remove my drawers in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Will you please send someone to mend our cracked sidewalk.
Yesterday my wife tripped on it and is now pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Our kitchen floor is very damp, we have two children and would
like a third, so will you please send someone to do something about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Could you please send someone to fix our bath tap. My wife got
her toe stuck in it and it is very uncomfortable for us.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BLOOD RED &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A teacher was giving a lesson on the circulation of the blood.
Trying to make the matter clearer, he said: `Now, boys, if I stood
on my head the blood, as you know, would run into it, and I should
turn red in the face.`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes, sir,` the boys said.
</P>
<P>
   Then why is it that while I am standing upright in the ordinary
position the blood doesn't run into my feet?`
</P>
<P>
   A little fellow shouted, `'Cause yer feet ain't empty.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BUMPER TIME! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I doubt, therefore I might be.
</P>
<P>
   Age is a very high price to pay for maturity.

   &UR; RAINY DAYS IN TEXAS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A visitor to Texas once asked, `Does it ever rain out here?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes, it does,` replied the rancher. `Do you remember that part
in the Bible when it rained for 40 days and 40 nights?`
</P>
<P>
   `Yes, I'm familiar with Noah's flood,` the visitor said.
</P>
<P>
   `Well,` said the rancher, `we got two and a half inches during
that spell.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GETTING READY FOR THE CRASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A plane full of retirees headed for Florida was gripped with
fear when the pilot announced, `Two of our engines are on fire; we
are flying through a heavy fog, and it has eliminated all our
visibility.`
</P>
<P>
   The passengers were numb with fear, except for one...a retired
minister. `Now, now, keep calm,` he said. `Let's all bow our heads
and pray.`
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the group bowed their heads to pray...except one
man. `Why aren't you bowing your head to pray?` the minister asked.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't know how to pray,` replied the passenger.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, just do something religious!` instructed the minister.
</P>
<P>
   The man got up and passed his hat down the aisle, taking an
offering.

   &UR; BILL'S WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton says he wants ``lawmakers of both parties to make
patient protections their first order of business.'' And
impeachment their last?
</P>
<P>
   Russia's parliament has voted 253-94 to reject Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister. Opponents, who say he'd just make
things worse, consider their no vote a safety nyet.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia, Mr. Clinton will visit Ireland. He probably
thought of his vacation home at Martha's Vineyard as ire land.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton played no golf on his recent vacation. No doubt
Hillary thought he'd already done enough swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr, it's reported, has hired Stephen Bates, a literary
editor and lawyer, to help write the Lewinsky report for Congress.
The surprise is he didn't pick Matt Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having to become quite an expert in this business of
asking for forgiveness,'' says Mr. Clinton. But as he surely knows,
it's often easier than seeking permission.
</P>
<P>
   This fall Hillary Rodham Clinton plans a promotion tour for
``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy,'' a collection of children's letters.
Odd. We expected ``It Takes a Village _ to Impeach a President''.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky, it's reported, is being offered huge book
publishing deals. Her story would be in an expanded category:
kiss-etc.-and-tell.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders who've talked to Mr. Clinton say he wishes he'd done
better with his Lewinsky speech. Maybe he could improve with
Flowers or Willey addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Recently it has seemed as if the best news of the day is that
there have been no reports of gun dealers offering ``Back to
School'' specials.

are flying through a heavy fog, and it has eliminated all our
visibility.`
</P>
<P>
   The passengers were numb with fear, except for one...a retired
minister. `Now, now, keep calm,` he said. `Let's all bow our heads
and pray.`
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, the group bowed their heads to pray...except one
man. `Why aren't you bowing your head to pray?` the minister asked.
</P>
<P>
   `I don't know how to pray,` replied the passenger.
</P>

   `Well, just do something religious!` instructed the minister.

   Mr. Clinton says he wants ``lawmakers of both parties to make
patient protections their first order of business.'' And
impeachment their last?
</P>
<P>
   Russia's parliament has voted 253-94 to reject Viktor
Chernomyrdin as prime minister. Opponents, who say he'd just make
things worse, consider their no vote a safety nyet.
</P>
<P>
   After Russia, Mr. Clinton will visit Ireland. He probably
thought of his vacation home at Martha's Vineyard as ire land.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton played no golf on his recent vacation. No doubt
Hillary thought he'd already done enough swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Starr, it's reported, has hired Stephen Bates, a literary
editor and lawyer, to help write the Lewinsky report for Congress.
The surprise is he didn't pick Matt Drudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having to become quite an expert in this business of
asking for forgiveness,'' says Mr. Clinton. But as he surely knows,
it's often easier than seeking permission.

better with his Lewinsky speech. Maybe he could improve with
Flowers or Willey addresses.

   Tuesday afternoon, showers associated with the moisture from
Tropical Storm Earl swept ashore over parts of the central and
eastern Gulf of Mexico. Wednesday, heavier showers will reach the
same area as the storm attains hurricane force while moving
gradually north over the central Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The heaviest rain will occur over southeastern Louisiana, where
one to three inches of rain will be common. While coastal breezes
will gust over 25 mph, very strong winds will remain over the open
waters of the Gulf throughout the day. Meanwhile, most of the
interior Southeast will be very warm with a mixture of clouds and
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and scattered showers will precede a cold front as it
moves east from the Great Lakes States. Mainly overcast skies will
prevail over much of northern New York and New England. Coastal
areas will have variable clouds and some sunshine. In the wake of
the front, breezes from the northwest will deliver a cool, dry air
mass to the Great Lakes and northern Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Heat will build over the Plains States where abundant sunshine
will prevail. Afternoon temperatures near 100 will occur over
central and northern Texas. The searing heat will shift north into
the central Plains on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, offshore winds will produce another hot day along
the coast from southern Oregon to California. Unusually hot weather
will also persist over the interior Northwest and northern Rockies.
Farther south, a cluster of clouds and scattered thundershowers
will keep temperatures near seasonal levels over the central and
southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: TINY TARGET
</P>
<P>
   Tropical storm warnings were issued for Bermuda on Tuesday, as
Hurricane Danielle was expected to skirt this archipelago located
more than 600 miles east of the Carolinas. Despite its location in
the central Atlantic Ocean near where many storms recurve out of
the tropics, it is rare for Bermuda to take the brunt of a tropical
cyclone. Given that the area of maximum winds typically extends
less than 50 miles from a hurricane's center, Bermuda, which
encompasses only 21 square miles, makes for a tiny target. Indeed,
a direct hurricane strike on Bermuda is akin to finding a needle in
a haystack. &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ The Senate is expected to vote today (WED) to
approve a nuclear-waste agreement among Texas, Maine and Vermont
despite last-minute lobbying against the pact by about 15 Texans,
including several from the West Texas area where the waste may be
stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we're going to have some strong opposition (to the
waste agreement), but it's an uphill fight,'' said Sen. Paul
Wellstone, D-Minn., the lead opponent in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday on the Capitol grounds, where he
was surrounded by Texans holding posters protesting the waste
agreement, Wellstone said their fight has been hampered by a lack
of support from the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone said he has heard ``precious little'' from an
administration that ``says it's focused on environmental justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need the president's and vice president's support,''
Wellstone said. ``We need for them to speak out.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton overseas and no formal statement of administration
policy drawn up as of Tuesday, it was unlikely that Wellstone would
receive reinforcements in time for today's vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote is the last legislative action needed to seal an
agreement, known as a compact, that will allow Maine and Vermont to
ship low-level radioactive waste _ including pieces of dismantled
nuclear power plants _ to Texas for long-term storage. The House
has already approved the compact, which does not specify a site for
storing the waste.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Legislature has approved a site near Sierra Blanca in
Hudspeth County for the waste dump, but that plan became less
certain in early July when state examiners recommended that the
site be rejected because of concerns that the area's geology and
the economic impact of the dump hadn't been adequately addressed.
Those two issues drove Tuesday's protest and lobbying effort in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The geological study should include a look at what leakage from
the waste site might do to underground water supplies and the Rio
Grande, said State Rep. Norma Chavez, D-El Paso, and Sierra Blanca
resident Bill Addington _ two of the Texans who met Senate staffers
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a hanging offense to poison a man's well in
Texas,'' Addington said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact on Sierra Blanca, a mostly Hispanic
community about 90 miles southeast of El Paso, is what has stirred
Wellstone's passion against the compact: ``This isn't just a Texas
issue. This is a national civil rights issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone's work against the waste agreement earned him honorary
Austin citizenship last October from the Austin City Council and
gratitude Tuesday from state Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not fair to dump on us (in Texas), and I thank Sen.
Wellstone for serving as my senator,'' Burnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' two senators, Republicans Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey
Hutchison, support the compact. Both have said they're following
the wishes of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, former Gov. Ann Richards
and the Texas Legislature. In a statement Tuesday, Hutchison also
noted that the compact has been approved by governors and state
lawmakers in Maine and Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe the federal government has a mandate to
nullify a contract signed by three state governors and ratified by
their legislatures,'' Hutchison said.
</P>

   The state agency in charge of developing the waste site, the
Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Authority, has taken
issue with the examiners' report in a formal response, according to
Geoff Connor, general counsel of the Texas Natural Resource
Conservation Commission, which must approve the site.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the site have a Friday deadline for filing their
response to the authority's comments, Connor said. The examiners
will then be allowed to revise their assessment before their report
goes to the full commission.
</P>
<P>
   Connor said he could offer no time frame for when the commission
might take up the matter of placing the dump.

REPLICAS OF WASHINGTON'S FLAG TO GO UP ON SPACE SHUTTLE

   WASHINGTON _ John Glenn will not be the only symbol of history
on the space shuttle mission this fall. Two modern replicas of
George Washington's personal flag from the Revolutionary War will
be on board.
</P>
<P>
   Once back on Earth, the flags will used in the 1999
commemorations of the 200th anniversary of Washington's death.
Ceremonies are planned at Mount Vernon, the first president's home
in Virginia, and at Valley Forge, the site near Philadelphia where
Washington and his troops spent the bitter winter of 1777-78.
</P>
<P>
   The trip into space for the 2-foot-by-3 foot silk standards was
approved by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration after
requests from the two historic sites. The shuttle Discovery mission
with 77-year-old Glenn, a Democratic senator from Ohio who was the
first American to orbit the Earth, is scheduled to be launched Oct.
29 and return Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The original flag is displayed at Valley Forge, whose historical
association acquired it from a direct descendant of Washington's
sister, Betty Washington Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was (Washington's) personal emblem as he helped lead the
fight for independence in the Revolution,'' said Mike Quinn,
director of education at Mount Vernon. ``To have it circle the
globe symbolizes his legacy, because representative democracy has
spread around the world in the last 200 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag has 13 large white stars that cover the background,
which has faded but was apparently what textile specialist Sally
Queen called ``true blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Quinn said the Washington family tradition that places the flag
with the general during the war ``has proved to be very reliable,''
although ``other documentation is more circumstantial.''
</P>
<P>
   The replicas are being made by the Washington-area firm owned by
Queen, a Dallas native who has recreated clothing of Thomas
Jefferson for Colonial Williamsburg and Washington's inaugural suit
for the Bicentennial Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Queen said she and ``a modern-day Betsy Ross,'' Carol Kocian,
are hand-stitching the flag, which is expected to be finished by
the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle flights, in addition to scientific payloads, usually
carry a variety of personal and historical mementoes, some put
aboard by NASA and others by astronauts in what are known as
``personal payload kits.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more unusual items to go aloft was the ashes of Gene
Roddenberry, creator of the ``Star Trek'' series. &QL;

OPERA NEWS: A MAGAZINE CATCHING UP WITH OPERA'S NEW GLOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ rue opera fans have never turned to Opera News, the
leading magazine on opera in the United States, for glossy picture
layouts and puffy life-style pieces. It's not that opera fans
aren't interested in the latest gossip about, say, which singer is
in disfavor at La Scala or which young baritone is courting which
promising soprano. And Opera News is a pretty good source for such
tidbits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rather, what has won the magazine a circulation of more than
120,000 is its substantive coverage of opera _ reviews of
productions and performances from around the world, profiles of
singers, conductors and designers, historical pieces, and
often-insightful essays.
</P>
<P>
   A quick glance at the just-released September issue, however,
the first under the magazine's new editor, might lead some to think
that Opera News has become Vanity Fair. At 120 pages, it is the
largest issue ever and has undergone a complete design overhaul,
with a new logo, a jumble of different type faces and, most
noticeably, lots of large, fancy color photographs. Is this
venerable magazine becoming the operatic equivalent of a glossy
monthly?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, said the new editor and publisher, Rudolph Rauch.
``There are major changes in the look and feel of the magazine,''
Rauch, 55, said in a recent interview at his Lincoln Center office.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Opera is a growing art form, but our circulation was
not growing. Opera is very visual today, and younger audiences are
visually oriented. So we thought we'd make the magazine more
visually appealing. But the staff and I were united in believing
that we also had to give readers more pages and a better
magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   Readers are likely to differ over the appeal of the changes.
More telling will be whether the magazine maintains its substantive
content and, especially, its independence, which has historically
been a ``touchy issue,'' said Patrick J. Smith, the respected
author and opera expert, who was editor of Opera News for the last
nine years.
</P>
<P>
   Opera News is published by the Metropolitan Opera Guild, which
was founded in 1935 to support the Met and win audiences for opera
in general. Opera News appeared the following year as an eight-page
leaflet covering the Met. For at least its first 25 years, Opera
News was indisputably the house organ of the Met, said Smith, who
started writing for it in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   During the regime of Rudolf Bing it was impossible to write a
critical article about an important Met singer or a piece about
another company, Smith added. ``That changed long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporting on the company has remained a central part of the
magazine's mission, which it especially fulfills in its articles
relating to the Texaco-Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts on
Saturday afternoons in the central months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The guild continues to support the Met, Rauch said, ``to the
tune of some $4 million a year,'' which comes from the
contributions of more than 70,000 guild members, educational
programs, and merchandising (the guild runs five gift shops in
Lincoln Center).
</P>
<P>
   Rauch, a passionate opera buff with no formal background in
music who jokes that as an undergraduate he wrote some music
reviews for the Princetonian that were ``not noticeably well
informed,'' intends to protect the magazine's independence. To this
task he brings extensive experience as a journalist, first as a
reporter for Radio Free Europe in Munich, then as a correspondent
for Time, which included a stint in Saigon during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   For the last four years, Rauch was the managing director of the
guild. Should readers be concerned that Opera News, which covers
the Met, is now run by someone who led an organization that
supports the company financially?
</P>
<P>
   ``Opera News is officially, intellectually and emotionally a
separate organization,'' Rauch said. One rationale for changing the
magazine, he added, was to attract younger audiences who are not so
tied to the Met's schedule of broadcasts. This explains, in part,
the decision to adjust the publishing schedule, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opera News formerly was published 17 times a year, once a month
during the Met's off-season, twice a month during the broadcast
season. Now it will become a monthly. But each issue will be larger
than before, Rauch said. ``The average size will now be about 100
pages, rather than about 60 in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Loyal subscribers were not complaining about the irregular
previous schedule, but ``advertisers were terribly confused,''
Rauch said. ``And at the newsstands they couldn't figure out why
some issues should stay available for two weeks, and others for a
month.''
</P>
<P>
   The clearest indication of the magazine's independence is that
one can read quite negative reviews of Met performances: for
instance, John W. Freeman, covering this spring's new production of
``Samson et Dalila,'' wrote that the company ``has been on the
prowl again for modernity and relevance, coming up with not much of
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mutually beneficial relationship between the Met and
the magazine can seem as confusing as the old 17-issue publishing
schedule. Rauch said he planned to nurture his editorial
prerogatives.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Joseph Volpe, the Met's combative general director,
Rauch said: ``I don't think Volpe spends much energy worrying about
enterprises he is not responsible for. On the other hand, when we
write something that makes his life more difficult, say, a piece
about the relationship of one of his stars to the company, then he
has a way of making his displeasure known. But in the four years
I've been associated with Opera News, Volpe has never said a word
about any review of any Met production.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admirers of the magazine as it has been may be reassured by
Smith's decision to remain on staff as editor at large. His
stepping down was a mutual decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 65. I wanted more time to travel, and didn't want to
oversee all the problems involved in reformatting a magazine,''
Smith said. ``Obviously, a new person will have new ideas and take
a magazine in a direction that is not necessarily mine. I stand on
my record, and I'm glad to still be around.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Rauch is fired up, confident, and proud of the new
issue. He singles out, for example, a new twist on an existing
feature called ``Sound Bites,'' which, in the new issue, consists
of a two-page color spread on the ruggedly handsome young American
baritone Rodney Gilfry, who is to create the role of Stanley
Kowalski in ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' an opera by Andre Previn
that will receive its premiere at the San Francisco Opera on Sept.
19. Pictured in jeans and a white T-shirt, Gilfry looks like
opera's answer to the young Marlon Brando.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying article is indeed bite-size, about 300 words.
But the layout should help make opera seem sexy, and that may
attract those younger readers that editors everywhere think about
constantly.

COURTNEY LOVE: HER BAND, HERSELF, MADE OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Songs, singers and songwriters have no fixed relationship. Some
songs float free almost immediately to become pop standards or
folky anthems as separate from individuals as ``My Funny
Valentine'' or ``Blowin' in the Wind.'' Others mold themselves to
interpreters' personalities, as ``My Way'' suited Frank Sinatra and
later Sid Vicious.
</P>
<P>
   And certain songs are virtually inseparable from their
originators; they are tied to a place, a sound, a life story. Smart
pop stars use them to build myths.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Love's songs for Hole on the band's third album,
``Celebrity Skin'' (Geffen), are bound to be heard in the context
of a life made for tabloid headlines. Ms. Love is a former stripper
turned punk singer and the widow of a suicidal, heroin-using,
million-selling rock star, Kurt Cobain. After his death in 1994,
she went on turn herself into a surgically altered,
couture-wearing, Oscar-nominated actress, apparently becoming the
kind of Hollywood figure that many of her punky original fans
detested.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Love is no stranger to public attention and, despite many
clumsy pronouncements over the last four years, no fool. With the
songs on ``Celebrity Skin,'' she performs a kind of psychic jujitsu
on behalf of her public persona, deftly shifting the angle of any
attacks. ``Oh make me over, I'm all I wanna be,'' she sneers in the
album's first words, with buzzing guitar chords that jab between
the lines. ``A walking study in demonology.'' But the song,
``Celebrity Skin,'' evades autobiography to present a bitter
portrait of disposable Hollywood starlets _ ``Hooker waitress model
actress'' _ whose last vestige of self-respect is the declaration,
``You want a part of me/ Well I'm not selling cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, the album goes on to contemplate ambition, fame,
lost innocence, love and death. Ms. Love sings about the faith of
fans, about a lover who ``hit so hard I saw God,'' about misery and
about watching someone slip away. The songs ricochet from
desolation to fury to pride; Ms. Love's lyrics agonize over the way
people let themselves be used and the way rebellion turns into a
commodity.
</P>
<P>
   They also mourn a lover who was sincere, self-destructive,
trusting, beautiful, violent and impossible to save: a version of
Cobain that verges on punk hagiography. But they don't hide Ms.
Love's ambivalence, and she's still arguing with him after death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get well soon, please don't go any higher,'' she begs in
``Malibu.'' In ``Reasons to Be Beautiful,'' she alludes to Cobain's
suicide note, which quoted Neil Young's line, ``It's better to burn
out than to fade away''; she sings, ``When the fire goes out you
better learn to fake/ It's better to rise than to fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hole has had a sonic makeover. The band and its collaborators,
including Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins on five songs and
Charlotte Caffey of the Go-Go's on one, have traded rawness for
richness, and they give every song a shapely melody. Although Ms.
Love does thank a vocal coach in the album's liner notes, her voice
still has its old droopy determination before it works itself up to
a Patti Smith rasp. But Ms. Love now has new capabilities; every
few songs, she overdubs her voice into an ethereal chorus.
</P>
<P>
   And Hole's new music bespeaks Los Angeles, not Seattle. Power
chords ring cleanly, folk-rock fingerpicking gleams; it's the Los
Angeles of the Mamas and the Papas, Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty and
the Go-Go's, not the punk underworld of X or the Germs. The
one-chord blare of ``Use Once and Destroy'' unfolds with
architectural grandeur, even as Ms. Love sings about ``the
emptiness that's all you have left,'' and ``Heaven Tonight,'' with
shimmering guitar and Ms. Love's voice multiplied into a choir, is
pure, determinedly optimistic California pop.
</P>
<P>
   The band has learned from its collaborators. ``Awful'' and
``Boys on the Radio,'' both written by Hole on its own, are
Go-Go's-style power pop. In ``Awful,'' a song about how each
generation of ``girls like you is betrayed by its pop stars,'' Ms.
Love sings, ``I was punk, now I'm just stupid, I'm awful,'' yet the
songs finds hope in the fans' devotion. ``Boys on the Radio'' turns
mourning into triumph _ ``When the water is too deep, I will ease
your suffering'' _ but then, in its final verse, veers sharply: ``I
know you are rotten to the core,'' Love sings.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Northern Star,'' with music by Hole's guitarist, Eric
Erlandson, uses the orchestral pomp associated with Smashing
Pumpkins; unfortunately, it also takes on some of the Pumpkins'
pretension.
</P>
<P>
   Only one track on the album echoes Nirvana's grunge, with Ms.
Love's vocal rising to a raspy near-scream as extra power chords
kick in for the chorus. The choice of style is pointed, because
``Playing Your Song'' is a furious elegy for Cobain and his music:
``They bought and sold it all it's gone/ They've taken it and built
a mall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Celebrity Skin'' is a memorial for Cobain and a farewell to
the idea of punk purity, an honesty so powerful it was supposed to
transform both rock and the world around it. Ms. Love can't replace
either one. The best she can do is to rail against cynicism and
strive to make rock craftsmanship support her passion. Her songs,
like most first-person accounts in any medium, are self-serving;
they may or may not rewrite history.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't matter. Songs this strong will inexorably break
free of their origins, ready to celebrate and lament other doomed
lovers, other lost hopes.

TV NOTES: TEPID DEBUT FOR STERN SHOW  
 ACTIVIST ARM-TWISTING 
LINGERING SUMMER HITS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   A station manager in Lubbock, Texas, disliked what he saw of
``The Howard Stern Radio Show,'' the newest entry to Saturday
late-night television, strongly enough to drop the show on Monday,
after its first two weeks on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the reaction was not so strong, but the show's
Nielsen ratings dropped from the first week's fairly strong
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Stern's pronouncements that his show would clobber
NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' in the ratings, it did not. In the 19
major-market cities where the shows compete, Stern's show earned a
4.3 Nielsen rating, way behind the 6.4 of ``Saturday Night Live,''
and well off the 5.9 the Stern show had the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a spokeswoman for CBS, whose syndication company,
Eyemark, sells Stern's shows to stations, said it was giving most
of those stations hefty ratings increases for the time slot,
compared with whatever show was in that slot earlier this summer
and in August last year. ``We're seeing double- and triple-digit
increases for the time period,'' said the spokeswoman, Rosemary
Kennan.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael Pfleger says that Jerry Springer broke his
promise, and Pfleger and his band of activists in Chicago are not
going to let him off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, after Pfleger organized protests opposing the
fist-fighting, hair-pulling, chair-swinging behavior encouraged on
Springer's talk show, the producers agreed to stop the violence,
starting June 8.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, the show's Nielsen ratings declined, and
Springer complained that the show's syndicator, not he, had made
the no-violence promise. Within a month, the violence was back.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Roman Catholic
Church, went to Los Angeles and picketed outside the offices of
Studios USA (a unit of USA Networks), which syndicates ``The Jerry
Springer Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Pfleger has picked out the 19 companies whose commercials
appear most often on the show, and is organizing a campaign asking
them to stop advertising there. They range from Sony and Seagram to
Glaxo Wellcome, the drug company.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of seven national organizations, including the Rev.
Jesse Jackson of the Rainbow/PUSH coalition and Martin Luther King
III of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, support the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Studios USA's group president, Robert Fleming, insisted that the
Springer show's violence had been reduced through stricter editing
that began in July. ``We believe, and our viewers tell us, that our
newly edited shows have been tremendously toned down,'' he wrote to
Pfleger last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the station that was the focus of the original
protests, WFLD (a Fox affiliate), deletes the violence. The
station's general manager, Stacey Marks-Bronner, ``is keeping her
end of the bargain,'' Pfleger said. ``Studios USA is not.''
</P>
<P>
   _ By Lawrie Mifflin.
</P>
<P>
   This summer has proved unusually fertile ground for new shows;
two might reasonably be labeled hits.
</P>
<P>
   On ABC, Drew Carey's improvisational comedy show, ``Whose Line
Is It Anyway?,'' has done so well on Wednesday nights that the
network has ordered 13 more episodes. That makes the show the first
reinforcement ABC would be likely to call on if one of its new
sitcoms fails this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The network has dismissed speculation that it might shelve one
new comedy, ``The Secret Lives of Men,'' which is supposed to go in
the same 9:30 p.m. spot, to keep ``Whose Line'' there through the
start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Carey has told the network that he would have no trouble keeping
both shows running.
</P>
<P>
   The other summer hit is Fox's ``Guinness World Records _ Prime
Time,'' which has won in its time period virtually every week it
has been on. Fox plans to extend it to 22 episodes, and is saying
only that the show will return in midseason as a ``utility player''
that can be slotted all over its schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But the performance of ``Guinness'' has been spectacular: it has
more than 12 million viewers a week in summer, when viewing is off
by as much as a third.
</P>
<P>
   That success has led to speculation that Fox will use the show
to fill the hole on Thursday at 9 p.m. left by the postponement of
the series ``Hollyweird,'' which has had so many production
problems that there are doubts it will ever get on the air.
</P>
<P>
   A third summer series possibility is ABC's ``Maximum Bob.'' It
got strong reviews and started with some positive ratings but has
leveled off. ABC is still considering its options for that show.

POP REVIEW: THREE RAPPERS WHO FLIP AND ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Black Eyed Peas stood on the cliff's edge of a
problem during the first of two shows Sunday night at S.O.B.'s, but
whirled away and gracefully made it into an opportunity. A few
songs in, the trio of rappers realized they needed one more
microphone onstage, to accommodate Kym Hill, the singer
accompanying them. ``I need a mike,'' murmured Hill, and the show
lost pace as she waited.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the band riffed a jazzy interlude, the rapper Taboo
began chanting Hill's request into his microphone. Will.I.Am, the
group's founding member, picked up his improvisation, rhyming in
typical freestyle fashion about the group's prowess and dexterity.
Apl.de.Ap, the third of the Peas, picked up the verse until Hill
finally received her microphone. ``We got a mike, y'all!'' the
three MC's shouted. The kind of technical glitch that has often
reduced rap groups to bumbling around the stage had been
transformed into a memorable moment.
</P>
<P>
   The growing audience for this new group, the latest in a long
line to be dubbed an alternative to the fantastical gangster games
of hip-hop's mainstream, might have expected this kind of
creativity. The Black Eyed Peas are known for their live shows, a
rare base for a reputation in rap. Will.I.Am (whose real name is
Will Adams), Apl.de.Ap (Allan Pineda) and Taboo (Jamie Gomez) began
as dancers in a troupe called Tribal Nation, and their acrobatic,
artful movements play a key role in their shows. At one point
Sunday, Taboo pushed the audience into a ring so that each member
could spin and flip in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Eyed Peas proved as good live as their hype promised,
not because their rhymes were so distinctive or the band's pleasant
grooves were so fresh, but because they flaunted personality in
excess. The threesome struck fierce poses as they championed
musicality over materialism and multicultural tolerance over
prejudice. Since Taboo is Native American and Mexican, Apl.de.Ap is
Filipino and black, and Will.I.Am is black, the Peas are a living
example of the diversity they preach.
</P>
<P>
   But the Black Eyed Peas aren't simply a happy example of
affirmative action at work. By performing with a live band, an
increasingly common but still distinctive choice for a rap group,
the three rappers linked hip-hop with its improvisational
predecessors, blues and jazz. While their songs lacked the striking
hooks of mainstream rap, they did possess subtle rhythms and
melodic changes. Their commitment to experimentation means that,
unlike far too many hip-hop groups, the Black Eyed Peas may get
better over time. Meanwhile, they offer plenty of fun for a night
out.

   NEW YORK _ Ranging across theater, literature, film and
equestrian art, the director Peter Brook and Bartabas, the artistic
director of the acclaimed equestrian theater troupe Zingaro, will
discuss their work this month at the French Institute/Alliance
Francaise. The talks, the first in this season's series of
dialogues at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, represent a
collaboration between the two institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Brook will talk about his new memoir, ``Threads of Time,'' and
his career at 7 p.m. on Tuesday at the French Institute's Tinker
Auditorium on 22 E. 60th St. in Manhattan. Bartabas, whose newest
production, ``Eclipse,'' will be presented at Battery Park City by
the Brooklyn Academy of Music from Sept. 9 to Nov. 1, will be
interviewed by the author Robert Grescovic at 7:15 p.m. on Sept. 24
in Florence Gould Hall at 55 E. 59th St. Afterward, Bartabas will

`DAMFINO': THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE AS DECODED BY THE UNHINGED
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.)

 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Poor, dumb astronomers, the wigged-out letter writers
all seem to be saying. ``I know something about life that others
don't seem to know,'' confides one deranged correspondent. Another
scolds, ``You cannot comprehend on account of your scientific
education!''
</P>
<P>
   The exploration of the stars is a matter of some disturbance to
the disturbed, at least as documented in the dreamily evocative
``Damfino,'' a stylish movement-and-theater piece by the
Collapsable Giraffe, an experimental troupe with ties to the
Wooster Group. Based on actual letters from the clearly unhinged
that were posted over the last 87 years to the Mount Wilson
Observatory outside Pasadena, Calif., the show is a multimedia
melange of the real and surreal, a demonstration, in a sense, of
how new technology helps to supply a rationale for the
inexplicable, and at the same time incites new variations on
madness.
</P>
<P>
   During the hourlong piece at the Performing Garage in SoHo, the
five cast members, under Jim Findlay's cool, detached direction,
robotically recite excerpts from the letters, compiled in a 1993
book, ``No One May Ever Have This Same Knowledge Again.''
Alternating with this litany by the certifiable are a series of
acted and danced sequences suggested by the movies of Buster Keaton
and enlivened with balletic assurance by Brian Bickerstaff,
portraying a perplexed Keatonesque clown.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between the divergent aspects of this often
fascinating production seems to have been kept tenuous
intentionally. Only at sporadic intervals do the letters inform the
action. Following a correspondent's whimsically personal decoding
of the laws of gravity, for instance, Bickerstaff is subjected to
their impact: As he looks for his shoes, two dozen of them fall
from the sky. But nothing in this exotic presentation is meant to
be taken too literally, except perhaps the title. ``Damfino,'' a
little research reveals, was the name of the floating disaster area
of a cabin cruiser in Keaton's 1921 ``Boat.'' In the film, Damfino
is said to be pronounced, ``Damn if I know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an inside joke, to be sure, but it's not presented snidely.
The unknowable _ what inspires genius and what determines insanity?
_ is a topic of serious reflection here. And as with Keaton's
movies, Findlay's production toys with how novel things and
unpredictable events over which we seek to exercise control have a
confounding way of controlling us. In one vignette, Bickerstaff
professes love for a woman using a strange device, new to him, that
allows him to record his voice on a flat plastic disk. When he
demurely plays it for her, however, he finds that the machine has
also picked up an insulting aside, and she storms out.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of digression does take the audience far from the
piece's thematic launching pad; and indeed, there are moments in
which the company exhausts the material's dramatic possibilities.
But ``Damfino'' remains an eerie assault on the senses. Behind the
authors' pose of omniscience, the letters to the observatory are
poetic and childlike; ``People in the other world have glasses they
can see you with,'' says one. They are filled with a sense of
wonder, and also, an unreachable loneliness.
</P>
<P>
   On Findlay's bilevel set, which with its witness booths and
bizarre instruments looks like some weird cult's inquisition
chamber, four actors _ Amy Huggans, Guy Larkin, Quince Marcum and
Amy Webb _ speak for the letter writers. What they embody most
memorably in their affectless recitations is the emotional dryness
of the writers' collective paranoia. They're the less violent
cousins of the Bizarro-world heroes of ``Assassins,'' Stephen
Sondheim's all-American salute to homicidal delusion. What
compelled the observatory's correspondents to write? Another
mystery of the universe.

NATURAL GAS PRODUCERS PINNING HOPES FOR PRICE RECOVERY ON COLD
WINTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When crude oil prices fell by 40 percent
from late November to midsummer, energy producers comforted
themselves that the steadiness of natural gas prices would help
them hold onto a piece of profitability.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past month, the relatively insular U.S. natural gas
market has fallen sharply, from an average above $2 per thousand
cubic feet to lows of $1.60 for the September contract during the
last days of August.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that's because traders have noticed there are 500
billion more cubic feet of natural gas in storage in underground
rock formations and pipelines than at the same time a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up to about 2.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in
storage now,'' up from 2.1 trillion cubic feet a year ago this
week, ``and within a month, we'll have enough gas in storage to
cover the needs of the entire country through winter,'' said Ron
Gist, principal at the Houston energy consulting firm Purvin &AMP;
Gertz.
</P>
<P>
   Because gas producers say they need a price of $1.70 or better
to make a profit, and because they're not getting the $15-$18 per
barrel crude oil price they need for profitability on that fuel,
the energy industry has entered into its most protracted period of
nervousness since the collapse of oil prices a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have joined the worry party, cutting the market price
of many energy stocks in half from the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of our people produce oil and gas in tandem, and if both
prices go down, that makes for a very troublesome situation,'' said
Bill Core of Abilene, Texas, president of the West Central Texas
Oil &AMP; Gas Association. which extends from Big Spring to the Fort
Worth-Dallas metro area.
</P>
<P>
   Core says drilling is down at least 50 percent in his area,
meaning only half as many equipment rentals and jobs as a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Although crude oil prices are mostly subject to international
vagaries, particularly the politics of the producing nations,
natural gas prices hinge more on domestic concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the trouble began last winter when El Nino laid
unusually warm weather on most of the United States, cutting demand
for natural gas for heating in Northern states.
</P>
<P>
   Then when crude oil prices fell, many producers shifted their
emphasis from crude oil to natural gas. The completion of a
1.1-trillion-cubic-feet capacity pipeline from Canada, as well as
expansion of two major lines from Colorado, further added to the
surge in production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost before people realized it, there was a big surplus in
storage,'' said Gist.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with crude oil, producers postpone the pain of
low prices by hedging in futures markets.
</P>
<P>
   Because futures contracts beyond the current month have
continued to yield prices in excess of $2 per thousand cubic feet,
producers have an incentive to store their gas and sell contracts
for future delivery at prices higher than the current spot price.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy has paid off. Although the October contract
brought $1.69 per thousand cubic feet this week, the December
contract held at $2.24 per thousand cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just swells the storage levels,'' said Gist, who noted
that such a market scene eventually wears off as the out month
prices begin to drop and producers have less incentive to put gas
in storage.
</P>
<P>
   James Leahy, vice president of Pioneer Natural Resources Group
of Irving, Texas, said, ``We are hedged at about $2.30 per thousand
cubic feet into 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Leahy reflects the views of many when he says, ``We think that
prices will turn up come November, when colder weather happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most producers, Leahy said he thinks the United States
won't have two mild winters in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Science is on the side of that argument.
</P>
<P>
   A cooling detected in Pacific Ocean waters suggests that La
Nina, which follows El Nino, is on the way. If it follows the
pattern of its last visit in 1988-89, La Nina will mean cooler
temperatures in the northern United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gist, too, believes that demand for gas will be strong, both
from weather and industrial considerations.
</P>
<P>
   Core, giving the perspective of West Texas, says that not only
is a cold winter needed, it should be an early one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea of a good winter is where the temperature drops
enough for people to turn on their furnaces for a couple of weeks,
preferably in October or early November,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Richard Serra's newest sculptures are nothing if
not weighty.
</P>
<P>
   Physically, these nine steel pieces _ seven torqued ellipses, a
triple-tined serpentine and a six-block forged work _ total nearly
750 tons. (Imagine a herd of 100 full-grown African elephants.)
</P>
<P>
   Visually, they are meant to reinvent basic shapes and create new
spaces. Logistically, they presented an enormous challenge. Over
several weeks this summer, they moved by ship via the Panama Canal
to San Pedro, Calif., four of them hot from a foundry in Siegen,
Germany, and five from warehouses or a show at the Dia Center for
the Arts in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Then they made a slow-motion journey on flatbed trucks to the
Museum of Contemporary Art in downtown Los Angeles, where they go
on view to the public on Sept. 20. Getting them inside the museum's
Geffen Contemporary Wing required cutting a 30-by-30-foot hole in
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of cranes and truckers involved,'' said
Serra, who spent five weeks in Los Angeles laying out the show and
setting the pieces in place. This is the first time he has seen all
nine sculptures together, and he is using the occasion to study his
work, especially the torqued ellipses, which are curved plates of
steel that lean in and out simultaneously at various angles,
sometimes over the viewer's head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working well right now, and this show is really beneficial
for me,'' Serra said. ``I can cross-reference and go on. This
series hasn't played out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the exhibition. When it ends on Jan. 3, most of the
sculptures will be packed up and shipped to the Guggenheim Museum
in Bilbao, Spain, for a show next spring.

HANDEL'S UNDRAMATIC DRAMAS OVERTAKE THE PRESENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Handel has changed. For pretty much two centuries
after his death, in 1759, he was remembered primarily as a composer
of oratorios, anthems, concertos, suites and sonatas: music that
bolstered a gentlemanly image of magnificence and decisiveness. His
operas, so much more pliant and equivocal in tone, were largely
forgotten until the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1927, Handel finally made his debut as an opera composer in
the United States, when Smith College staged ``Giulio Cesare,''
which remained for several decades the Handel opera of choice. Most
of the others had to wait until after World War II for their first
modern performances, and only in the last two decades have a good
number of them begun to be regularly produced and recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The process of familiarization goes on. Friday, the second night
of its new season, the New York City Opera presents Handel's
``Partenope'' in a production introduced at Glimmerglass during the
summer, and two new recordings of other Handel operas have just
appeared on the Virgin Veritas label. ``Admeto'' (7243 5 61369;
three CDs) comes in a version that was first released 20 years ago;
the ``Rodelinda'' (7243 5 45277; three CDs) is new.
</P>
<P>
   As these recordings remind us, Handel owes his operatic rebirth
to the early-music movement. Whereas Monteverdi's scores, for
instance, have been revised by conductors (like Raymond Leppard)
and composers (like Luciano Berio and Hans Werner Henze) who were
concerned with matters other than period accuracy, Handel's operas
have escaped modernization _ except the kind of unspoken
modernization inherent in any revival, however well informed.
</P>
<P>
   Here, ``Admeto'' is conducted by one of the great
scholar-musicians of recent times, Alan Curtis, and ``Rodelinda''
is directed by another leading Baroque specialist, Nicholas
Kraemer.
</P>
<P>
   The essential difference between the recordings is probably due
less to any difference between these two individuals than to
general changes of outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Admeto'' performance preserves the style of the 1970s,
when strings playing in 18th-century style tended to sound raw,
tempos could be unyielding and singers were inclined to emote. In
``Rodelinda'' the orchestral sound is gentler on the ear, the
emphasis in the playing is more on detail _ a luscious harmonic
shift, a vital motif _ than on the long line, and the vocalism is
purer.
</P>
<P>
   Both recordings are blessed by some excellent singing. In
``Admeto,'' Rachel Yakar is strong, rich-toned and affecting as
Alcestis, and Jill Gomez is effectively more translucent in the
other leading female role, Antigone. As Hercules, Ulrik Cold
provides a fine lyrical baritone. The two countertenors in the
castrato roles _ Rene Jacobs as Admetus and James Bowman as
Thrasymedes _ are not heard quite at their outstanding best, and
the urge to express seems responsible for bringing baritonal colors
into their singing.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the two countertenors of the ``Rodelinda''
recording, Daniel Taylor and Robin Blaze, have their high registers
consistently in focus, and Taylor's exquisite singing of the
elaborate music for Bertarido is a delight. Like Jacobs, Taylor is
performing music Handel wrote for his leading castrato, Senesino,
but where Jacobs is big, often gorgeous and sometimes splashy,
Taylor is always vastly refined.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Rodelinda'' recording, in addition, the gap between
male and female voices narrows, especially when, from the other
side, Sophie Daneman finds such clear, white tones for the title
role. For all these later singers, precision, agility and rhythmic
freedom, not sumptuousness of color and expression, animate the
music and unleash its sensuousness.
</P>
<P>
   Two recordings are perhaps too little to provide all the
evidence, but a change appears to have come over how the drama of
Handel's operas is to be understood. Both ``Admeto'' and
``Rodelinda,'' like most Handel operas, are ostensibly intrigues of
crossed amorous passion, force and subterfuge set among the
inhabitants of remote courts. Handel's regular collaborator Nicola
Francesco Haym took his material from earlier librettos, which in
these cases were versions of Greek myth (as represented principally
in Euripides' ``Alcestis'') or French drama and distant history
(Corneille's ``Pertharite,'' based on events in seventh-century
Lombardy).
</P>
<P>
   In myth, drama and history, though, people normally interact,
and in Handel's operas they seldom do. Aria follows aria, and the
point of the intervening recitative is to set up the next
possibility for an aria as quickly as possible. Apart from the
final numbers, customarily sung by all surviving characters,
``Admeto'' and ``Rodelinda'' have just one duet apiece, at a late
point in the action, to interrupt the succession of solo numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the single voice, these are operas that, even more than
any in the bel canto repertory, are about singing. Accordingly, the
causes for singing are not of much account. In other operas we are
often persuaded that characters are singing to express emotions; in
Handel it seems, conversely, that the emotions are there to offer
occasions for singing.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because the music is, in addition, so openly formal, it
becomes impossible to believe that these creatures really feel what
they sing that they feel. All of them, the good as much as the
wicked, are performers. They provide us with the unsettling company
of people who go through the motions of an old story _ the tale of
a queen who sacrifices herself for her husband, the reunion of two
lovers after many trials and dangers _ to make an outrageous
display.
</P>
<P>
   Display is their goal, not their means. Performance for them is
life, and their life is a performance. Disguise, which often
features prominently in the drama (as Winton Dean remarks in his
note on ``Admeto,'' ``for long periods both heroines are concealed
from some of the other characters, but not from all''), is the game
they all play for real.
</P>
<P>
   The ``argument'' published with Haym's ``Rodelinda'' libretto
gives an outline of the historical background to the opera and
ends, with appealing candor, ``The rest is all Fictions.'' By
putting themselves forward as fictions, by daring to insist that
reality is what they make it, the characters of this and other
Handel operas have something to say _ or rather, to sing _ that has
a peculiarly modern resonance. It is not surprising that they had
to wait so long.

 &HT;    Flu study team remains optimistic
 &HT;    International scientists are still hopeful Arctic research will
help them combat future epidemics.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Longyearbyen, Norway _ Members of the 18-person team that spent
two weeks here searching for the 1918 influenza virus began packing
up and heading home Tuesday. But in many ways, the real work of the
expedition _ and the process of determining how successful it has
been _ lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In freezing temperatures and gale force winds, expedition leader
Kirsty Duncan and chief pathologist Dr. Charles Smith left for the
Norwegian mainland and then for home, following virologists Dr.
Robert Webster of Memphis and Dr. John Skehel of London. Despite
their departure, work has not ended at the graves where the bodies
of seven flu victims were unearthed. Six were sampled for evidence
of the virus that killed them, along with 40 million people. (The
seventh body was left intact at the family's request.) The five-man
digging crew and several key scientists remain behind. So does the
prize this expedition came to the top of the world to win: two blue
stainless-steel barrels, each the size of a beer keg, standing in a
household freezer inside a padlocked steel shipping container.
</P>
<P>
   Inside _ frozen to 5 degrees below zero and packed in three
layers of plastic and frozen shipping pellets _ are 113 samples of
tissue and other materials taken from the coffins of the victims of
the century's worst epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Today and Thursday, they will be loaded on separate flights and
shipped to the National Institute for Medical Research in London,
where they will be analyzed, divided and shared among collaborating
labs: Fort Detrick in Maryland, the University of Oslo in Norway
and a new lab being built by the Canadian Health Ministry in
Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   There, the tissue samples will be analyzed for particles of the
1918 flu virus. Scientists will also try to determine the genetic
makeup of the flu strain. That information, which could take
months, might help scientists understand what made the strain so
virulent. The team leaves on a note of elation, an attitude that is
hard for the watching press to understand. Duncan spent years
searching for unembalmed preserved flu victims before hearing of
burials on this archipelago within the Arctic Circle. She came in
hope of finding frozen bodies; the bodies she found, were cold, but
not frozen.

   ``It is not as though this is a temperate climate; if that were
acceptable, there are 12 flu burials in Toronto I could have
pursued,'' she said before leaving. ``The preservation here was
still superior to what I could have gotten in the rest of the
world.''

<P>
   Smith, a forensic pathologist in Ontario, added: ``I'm
disappointed by the perception that this was a failure. There are
parts of this that were phenomenally successful. ... We have
material that we can work on, that is in much better shape than we
expected when we opened the graves.''

 &HT;    Norwegian town an oasis of culture in frozen north
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Longyearbyen, Norway _ The high Arctic valley that has played
host for two weeks to the 1918 flu research team is a peculiar
place to search for one of the world's worst killers.
</P>
<P>
   The university campus boasts the northernmost Internet server on
the planet. A restaurant in this town of 1,200 belongs to the
Chaine des Rotisseurs gourmet society; its wine cellar offers a
premier cru Sauternes and $450 Chateau Margaux. The hotel in which
the flu team is staying was built for the U.S. delegation to
Lillehammer, then moved to this island; its TV system runs
``Seinfeld'' _ in Norwegian _ and ``Tales From the Crypt.''
</P>
<P>
   Two mountain passes south of town gleam white with glaciers. The
daily breakfast buffet includes caviar, three kinds of herring and
mushroom-brown, chewy smoked seal. And one week after the end of
the midnight sun, the street lamps have just been turned on again;
at 1 a.m., the sky is so bright, car headlights are not needed.
</P>
<P>
   Except, perhaps, to give early warning to wildlife on the road.
Traffic signs bearing the international symbol for caution depict
the profile of a polar bear. Several years ago, a university
student was killed by a bear on the plateau above the town. Since
then, no one leaves the town borders _ or in winter, walks the
half-mile between upper town and lower _ without a rifle slung over
one shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The weather itself is also life-threatening: changing quickly
from balmy 50-degree sunlight to bone-chilling 30-degree fog. The
conditions posed a challenge for the expedition. The dig's uniform,
peeking out at almost every wrist and neckline, is a navy wool
undershirt.
</P>
<P>
   Except for expedition leader Kirsty Duncan, who is so well-known
residents offer her rides to the dig, the crew has little contact
with town society. ``People support what they are doing, but people
are mostly quite busy,'' said Marianna Andersen of Svalbard's
tourist bureau.

 &HT;    Outta here! Longtime atlantans calling it quits as the hassles
of city life mount
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It all started for Sandra Carroll when she and her husband, Bob
Sprul, bought a vacation home on Tybee Island.
</P>
<P>
   The couple began spending less time at home in Atlanta and more
at the beach. The more time they spent there, the less satisfied
they were in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we would come back from Tybee on the weekends, I would
feel my neck turning into a tree stump from the time we hit Macon
till we got back to town. People are so angry,'' says 42-year-old
Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   She's feeling much less tense nowadays. Earlier this summer,
Carroll left a secure job as news and public affairs director at
WYAY-FM, and she and Sprul moved to Savannah full time. Her mother,
sister and brother and his family have relocated there, too.
</P>
<P>
   They're not alone. Metro Atlanta's population has grown by
nearly 600,000 in the '90s, more than any other metropolitan area
in the country except Los Angeles. But as tens of thousands are
moving in every year, large numbers also are leaving. In 1996
alone, more than 270,000 moved away, according to Internal Revenue
Service statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Some reasons for leaving _ finding a better job in another city,
for example _ have nothing to do with quality of life. But more and
more Atlantans are decamping because of traffic, overdevelopment,
urban stress and loss of community. Among those who have moved
recently are such well-known Atlantans as novelists Anne Rivers
Siddons and Terry Kay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get out of the traffic, the noise, the
confusion,'' says Kay, 60, who built a home last year on six acres
near Athens. ``I just wanted to have a far more simple and peaceful
existence, and I didn't find that in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Siddons, who bought a historic townhouse in Charleston, S.C.,
this year, has said she wanted to live in a ``gentler city.''
</P>
<P>
   The public's satisfaction with metro Atlanta is dropping,
according to a 1998 Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll. Thirty-four
percent of those polled said the quality of life had worsened in
the past five years. In a similar poll a year earlier,28 percent
agreed with that statement.
</P>
<P>
   According to another 1998 poll, of 197 local community leaders,
air quality, public schools and traffic were the problems that most
needed improvement.
</P>
<P>
   And the word is spreading. In June, a Wall Street Journal story
asserted that ``Clogged roads and polluted air are spoiling this
southern boomtown's most valuable asset: its reputation as a
pleasant place to live.'' Primary elections this summer saw
anti-growth sentiments prevail in Cherokee County and influence
races in other suburban counties.
</P>
<P>
   Kay, who moved here in 1959, saw Atlanta emerge as a major
league city and its population more than triple, from 1 million to
3.7 million. Some of the changes were exciting, others a sign of
success run amok. Meeting friends for coffee meant planning around
traffic patterns _ and, as traffic worsened, seeing them less
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when you could walk down the street of Atlanta and
look at somebody, and they'd look back at you and smile,'' Kay
says. ``I don't see that any more. People are rushed, they're too
suspicious. ... ``Here in Athens, in Watkinsville, that's sort of
the way things are done. People speak to you, and they smile and
they nod.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth and Lori Hicks were looking for that kind of community
when they moved last fall from Duluth to his hometown of
Greenville, S.C. When the Hickses lived in Duluth, he drove 45
minutes each way to his job in Buckhead, while she stayed at home
with their baby daughter in a subdivision virtually deserted during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter, I would see her with her eyes open on the
weekend,'' says Hicks, 33. ``She was asleep when I left in the
morning; she was asleep when I got home at 7:30 at night. I said I
don't care how much money I'm making, it's not worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta has no community if you're in a bedroom community,''
he says. ``It's not an enjoyable place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, a stockbroker, worried about how a move would affect his
client base. But with much of his business conducted over the
telephone anyway, he was able to transfer with a brokerage to
Greenville, keep Atlanta customers and find new ones there. The
family lives in a 50-year-old neighborhood just a mile from Hicks'
office, close enough for him to come home for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a no-brainer,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking is not unique to those dissatisfied with Atlanta.
The search for community has sent many Americans to smaller cities
and rural areas in the '90s. And it's not just happening in urban
centers: As the suburbs grow more crowded, suburbanites are moving
away, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things people tell me,'' says Kenneth Johnson, a
demographer and sociology professor at Loyola University in
Chicago, ``is they like to be in a smaller place because they feel
they can have more influence. It's not the anonymous place of the
big city.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the rural United States grew at its fastest rate in
more than 20 years, Johnson says. Between 1990 and 1996, 1.8
million Americans moved to rural areas, compared with 1.4 million
who moved away from them in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Abetting that movement is technology. ``Because the
transportation and communication systems are so good now, distance
is less of a factor than it once was,'' Johnson says.
</P>
<P>
   Robert and Doris Fowler moved from Lawrenceville to North
Georgia's Rabun County two years ago, trading in their
2,400-square-foot subdivision home for a mountaintop house twice
that size, with a view of Lake Rabun.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler, 39, commutes to Duluth three times a week, an hour and
15 minutes each way. He works out of his home on other days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rationalize that as it's a nice drive, and we rationalize
that as you could spend that (much time) coming back from the
Perimeter to Lawrenceville,'' says Doris Fowler, 39.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, both raised in small towns, moved to Rabun in search
of a close-knit community. After 10 years in metro Atlanta for him
and 17 for her, they wanted to live in a town where neighbors
watched out for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the best of both worlds,'' Doris Fowler says, ``all
the income potential that Atlanta affords people, and our home life
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's ``income potential'' does make it tough for some to
leave. Carroll's decision to move to Savannah meant changing
careers, from on-air personality in Atlanta to ad saleswoman in the
coastal city.
</P>
<P>
   But she says the trade-off was worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get older and start examining things, you realize
what was a priority 10 years ago is not as much of a priority as it
used to be,'' Carroll says. ``To be happy _ and to be happy near
your family _ to me that's more important than making a mark any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprul and Carroll are renovating a home built in the 1930s in a
neighborhood somewhat similar to the Midtown one they left.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, proposals to build large retail stores near their
home of two decades helped persuade them to move _ no easy decision
for Carroll, an Atlanta native who had always lived in Midtown, and
Sprul, 50, a native of Maine who had grown to love his adopted
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous adjustment,'' Carroll says. ``That second
week I was here, I was thinking, `What the hell did I do?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I miss my next-door neighbors, I miss the people I sang with.
There's things that will never be replaced here, but then this
place has things that Atlanta doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Restaurateur Alix Kenagy, settling into life in Brunswick after
an early August move, chalks up her relocation to a quest for
personal growth. Kenagy, co-creator of the Morningside restaurants
Indigo Coastal Grill and Partners, had lived in Atlanta for 23
years and wanted to start a new restaurant. Unable to find the kind
of historic intown building she hoped for in Atlanta, she had an
epiphany on a trip to Brunswick this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brunswick has that feeling of history that Atlanta is rapidly
losing,'' says Kenagy, 56. ``They're not getting rid of the
buildings in Brunswick.''
</P>
<P>
   She bought a 106-year-old building a block from the port. When
renovations are complete in January, she plans to open a seafood
grill there, with a loft for herself on the top floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised four children in Atlanta and truly truly cared about
Atlanta, but I find Atlanta is so busy, traffic is so busy, the
food scene is so frenetic and busy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Kenagy will continue working as a consultant for several Atlanta
restaurants, so she plans to spend a week or more each month here.
Some others who have set up permanent homes elsewhere, including
Kay and Siddons, keep a place to stay in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   For many reasons, including family, friends, business, medical
facilities and shopping or cultural offerings, Atlanta still exerts
a pull on some who have left. But that's not to say they'd move
back full time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to visit and there's just no better place to shop in
the world. But it's not where I want to live anymore,'' says Lilye
Holmes Foster, 55, a painter who returned to her hometown of Alamo,
Ga., in 1990, after more than two decades in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see myself leaving a space for somebody else who's younger,
who's into the social scene. It's a wonderful place to make a
career, but that wasn't something I was interested in.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster admits that the transition to small-town life has been
difficult, although the slower pace has helped her concentrate on
establishing herself as an artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't share too many of the same belief systems, but if I
wanted that, if I wanted a social life, all of that, that's what
Atlanta is for,'' she says. ``This is for being focused and
pursuing something.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a danger for ex-Atlantans, however _ particularly those
who land in the country. Just like the city-fleeing suburbanites of
the previous generation, they may bring the evils of car-based
development with them to their new bucolic homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always people who are going to be dissatisfied, and
they're going to have the money to pull up stakes and boogaloo out
of here. And they're going to be looking for the next golden
suburb,'' says Douglas C. Bachtel, a professor in the University of
Georgia's College of Family and Consumer Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they're going to create the problem in the next suburb
they're moving to _ or mountain area or coastal area.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Impellitteri of Clayton, who moved from Lawrenceville two
years ago, has mixed emotions about the metro Atlanta license tags
that pour into the North Georgia mountains on weekends. She and her
husband, Allen, 55, discovered the area where they decided to
retire by visiting, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad to share what we have with them,'' says
Impellitteri, 56. ``But we're glad when they go back. We don't want
to live ever again in a real crowded subdivision lifestyle.''

 &HT;    ``Mama Flora's Family'' shooting in Georgia
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After only a few minutes on the set of the upcoming CBS movie
``Mama Flora's Family'' being shot in Haralson, Ga., Cicely Tyson
knew there was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the heat, or the humidity: Tyson had filmed ``Fried
Green Tomatoes'' in Juliet during the dead of summer several years
ago, so she's accustomed to the brain-scrambling, 90-plus
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   It wasnt the cast, which includes rakishly handsome veterans
Blair Underwood and Mario Van Peebles, as well as
rapper-turned-thespian Dana Owens, aka Queen Latifah.
</P>
<P>
   And it certainly wasn't the part: her late friend, ``Roots''
author Alex Haley created the title role based on his own mother ,
and Tyson was his only choice to play the strong-willed southern
matriarch.
</P>
<P>
   It was the laundry that was bugging her.
</P>
<P>
   Before Tyson arrived, a prop assistant had hung shirts, sheets,
and blouses from a rickety wooden clothesline in Mama Flora's
dirt-covered backyard for a scene set in 1940's Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   It looked fine. But to Tyson, it was all wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to fix it,'' Tyson says later, explaining why she halted
the production to re-hang every article of clothing herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to show them that back in those days people didn't hang
pants from the waist, they'd hang them from the legs so they'd have
have more room. There wasn't enough room to hang everything
straight, you had to loop them over the line to give yourself more
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson sweating the details (she also had a crew member replace
white bar soap with more ``realistic'' brown soap) is more than
just a quirk of a finicky actress who never watches her own
performances, and insists on being called by her character's name
even when the cameras aren't rolling.
</P>
<P>
   For Tyson, her co-stars, and producer John Avnet, ``Mama Flora''
is a delicate, and personal tribute to Haley, who died in 1992
before finishing the generation-spanning novel he began nearly 14
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Friday before Alex died he sent a message to my manager,
`Tell Cicely I love her and I'm working on something for her,'''
Tyson recalls in a whisper while taking a break in her trailer.
``Then, of course, he died over the weekend. I never heard anything
about Mama Flora until years later. When I finally read the script,
I said when do we start?''
</P>
<P>
   While it's technically not a sequel, ``Mama Flora's Family''
echoes the tone and spirit of Haley's groundbreaking 1977
miniseries, which traced the threads of his family's ancestry back
to a west African slave named Kunta Kinte.
</P>
<P>
   Haley unspools the story of Flora Palmer, a Tennessee
sharecropper whose husband is killed by a white mob in the
1930's(?). The event shatters Flora's close-knit family, and over
the years, she struggles to reclaim them.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn-born Avnet, who has been behind such box office
hits as ``Risky Business'' and ``George of the Jungle,'' says
Tyson's character is named after the black woman who was a family
caregiver while he was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I met Alex, we started talking about the fact that the
woman who raised me, Flora Barber, was very similar to his
mother,'' Avnet remembers. ``We realized that in a funny way, I was
the white version of his black upbringing. We decided then that
Alex would write a book and we'd do a miniseries.''
</P>
<P>
   Avnet acknowledges some viewers might be offended by his attempt
at melding his personal experiences as a middle-class white man
with that of Haley's, a black writer whose extended family
experienced slavery and poverty firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it, but it never gave me any sleepless
nights,'' Avnet says. ``I guess it's because I feel that Alex
taught me so much. Most of what I know about the South came from
listening to him. Maybe after the fact if I get attacked really
badly, I'll look back and consider myself naive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the movie is set in Tennessee and Chicago, Avnet
returned to Georgia where he directed ``Fried Green Tomatoes'' in
1990(?).
</P>
<P>
   Avnet chose evocatively picturesque locations, such as Haralson,
which was transformed into a pre-World War II cotton mill. A public
housing project in Griffin became the backdrop for a brief reunion
of Flora's family.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Mama Flora'' is finally nearing completion, the project
was stalled for years while Avnet made other films and Haley worked
on other projects. Haley sent his collaborator occasional rough
drafts while travelling aboard steamships where he often wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The book, was eventually completed by writer David Stevens after
Haley's death, and will be published next month by Scribner. CBS
plans to air the movie as a two-part miniseries Nov. 15-17.
</P>
<P>
   Although the process was frustrating Avnet says he's been
determined to complete the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to get in these bitter arguments with him because
(Haley) would give my wife and I so many gifts. You couldn't
outgive Alex because he was so generous,'' Avnet says. ``I told him
one day I'm going to get him. Of course I didn't. But I said this
will be my last gift to Alex, and he can't give me something
back.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Mama Flora's'' cast members, working on the film is also
an opportunity to repay Haley, who helped shaped their ideas, and
ideals about the American family _ as well as their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a different kind of story even though its
supposed to be a continuation of `Roots,' '' says Latifah, who
co-stars as Flora's niece, Diana ``It's enlightening in terms of
the situation a lot of Black America is in. Past my
great-grandmother, I don't know who I'm related to. But without
knowing who you are and where you came from, you wind up feeling
kind of lost. Knowledge of self is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, who plays Flora's troubled younger son Willie is
dressed in a pumpkin-colored, pin-striped Zoot suit with a matching
fedora, while waiting for his next scene. The 34-year-old actor
says he drew on recent personal experiences to help him understand
his role.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most important to me and the thing I'm most passionate
about is family and relationship, '' Underwood says. ``I have a
year-old son, and watching that relationship grow between a mother
and a son, that is sacred and magical. It is something to behold.''

PULL UP A SEAT; THESE BALLETS HAVE STORIES TO TELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Today, when abstractions dominate many ballet
repertories, it's tempting to proclaim plots unimportant. Dance is
an art of movement, and the best story in the world cannot disguise
unimaginative choreography. Nevertheless, should choreographers
wish to tell tales, good stories can help make good choreography
look even better. This is especially true of full-evening
productions.
</P>
<P>
   Recent months have offered several imposing multi-act story
ballets, ranging from Marius Petipa's 19th-century blendings of
classicism and exoticism to Boris Eifman's contemporary balletic
expressionism.
</P>
<P>
   A hit of American Ballet Theater's season at the Metropolitan
Opera House was ``Le Corsaire,'' Anna-Marie Holmes' staging of a
Petipa classic. No one could complain it lacked plot: Conrad, a
gallant pirate, kept saving the beautiful Medora from villain after
villain.
</P>
<P>
   And the adventures were punctuated by dance sequences of
breathtaking virtuosity. Yet it was possible to feel that
``Corsaire'' lacked something, especially if one compared it with a
similar Petipa work, ``La Bayadere,'' which Ballet Theater has
presented in the past. Both have exotic settings (Turkey in
``Corsaire,'' India in ``Bayadere''), elaborate plots and brilliant
choreography. ``Bayadere'' has something more: complex characters.
The people in ``Corsaire'' simply rush in and out of danger as if
they were in an old-fashioned movie serial.
</P>
<P>
   But consider what happens in ``Bayadere.'' Solor, a warrior, and
Nikiya, a temple dancer, are in love. Nikiya is also lusted after
by the High Priest, and when the Rajah rewards Solor for his valor,
the prize turns out to be marriage to Gamzatti, the Rajah's
daughter. Solor is torn by his love of Nikiya, obedience to his
monarch and Gamzatti's undeniable beauty. Learning of Nikiya's
feelings, Gamzatti vainly tries to have her renounce Solor, then
plots to have her killed. When Nikiya is dying of snakebite, the
priest offers her an antidote if she will be his. She chooses death
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bayadere'' is almost as action-packed as ``Corsaire.'' But it
also shows strong-willed people coping with love, honor, jealousy
and revenge. Conceivably, its basic situation might have fascinated
the great 17th-century French playwright Jean Racine, whose own
complex tragic plots often concern unreciprocated loves and clashes
between passion and duty. ``Bayadere'' has characters one can care
about.
</P>
<P>
   Petipa was not always lucky with his plots. For instance,
``Raymonda'' is especially vacuous, taking three long acts to show
a Crusader march into a castle and repel the Saracen who has been
harassing his fiancee. What rescues ``Raymonda'' artistically are
its sparkling dances. Yet they often look best when excerpted into
one-act suites divorced from the story. George Balanchine has
created several suites inspired by ``Raymonda,'' including
``Cortege Hongrois'' and ``Raymonda Variations,'' which are in the
New York City Ballet's repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatically, ``Raymonda'' is almost anorexically thin. So is
``The Snow Maiden,'' Ben Stevenson's new three-act spectacle for
Ballet Theater about a snow spirit who falls in love with Misgir, a
mortal. The audience soon guesses that the ballet will end when she
melts from the heat of her emotions. But her meltdown could occur
almost anytime. Have her melt upon meeting Misgir, and this would
be a one-act ballet. Have her melt when she follows him to a
festival, and it's a two-act ballet. Stevenson adds a third act by
having her melt at Misgir's wedding. This plot does not really
develop. Its denouement simply keeps being delayed.
</P>
<P>
   A simple plot can also be rich, as audiences who saw Ballet
Theater's production of Petipa's ``Sleeping Beauty'' know. Although
the story is uncomplicated, each incident propels the drama and the
dancing forward: a wicked fairy curses a newborn princess, a fairy
godmother modifies that curse, the child grows up, the evil fairy
casts her spell, but the princess falls asleep instead of dying; at
last, a prince awakes her and they marry in splendor.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``The Sleeping Beauty'' keeps unfolding steadily and
holds one's attention. Equally sturdy are the scenarios for most
balletic adaptations of Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet,''
including those of John Cranko, which the Stuttgart Ballet offered
this summer, and Kenneth MacMillan, which Ballet Theater dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corsaire,'' ``Bayadere,'' ``Sleeping Beauty'' and ``Romeo and
Juliet'' resemble realistic novels: their plots proceed in a
straightforward manner. But there is no reason every ballet should
be structured like that. Why can't ballets offer surrealistic
voyages into dream worlds or expressionist descents into emotional
maelstroms? The fact that Eifman undertook such journeys helped
enliven his ``Red Giselle'' and ``Tchaikovsky'' at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, these productions by the Eifman Ballet of St.
Petersburg suffered from exaggeration. Yet Eifman's hallucinatory
choreography allowed one to be hypnotized by ``Red Giselle,'' his
story of a ballerina's mental breakdown, and ``Tchaikovsky,'' which
focused on the composer's homosexual guilt. Times and places,
realities and illusions, were jumbled. Plots did more than thicken;
they boiled over. Eifman had stories he urgently wished to tell.
And he demonstrated that stories can be choreographed in
unconventional ways.

CHERNOMYRDIN SAYS HE WILL FORM GOVERNMENT WITHOUT PARLIAMENT'S
APPROVAL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ While anxiety over Russia's deepening economic crisis
spread, Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said Tuesday he
will form an acting government without waiting for parliamentary
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the current, most grave situation, the country cannot stay
without a government,'' he told a meeting of government officials.
``Delays and inaction may throw us back several years. This will
not happen. We must not allow this under any circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin did not say who he would name to his acting
government, but, given the political calculations of the moment,
his statement was seen as an attempt to speed up a languid
political process and to force the hand of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   After Chernomyrdin's nomination as prime minister went down to a
resounding defeat in the parliament's lower house on Monday,
political leaders were still arguing Tuesday whether the second
showdown should take place on Friday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the political stalemate remained uncertain, as
both sides in Russia's recurring political battle dug in their
positions. President Boris Yeltsin, stopping by a Moscow school for
the opening of the academic year, vowed to get Chernomyrdin
confirmed in a week's time, while leaders of the Communist
opposition said they would never approve him, even if it led to the
dissolution of the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who had ducked from view during the early days of the
political crisis, seemed to be regaining some of his fighting form,
despite rumors that his health had taken a turn for the worse.
Although he seemed tired during a television interview last Friday,
Western diplomats reported that he was in good form during private
meetings last week with Bulgarian president Petar Stoyanov, showing
full command of his material and engaging in give-and-take.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current crisis, which is threatening to engulf the
entire Russian economy, Yeltsin is still on the defensive, fending
off attacks from a Communist-led opposition bent on breaking his
grip on power. An attempt to shift some of the powers of the
presidency to the parliament collapsed last week, when the
Communists backed away from an agreement that they saw as a
tactical ruse to win Chernomyrdin's confirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Behind-the-scenes jockeying continued Tuesday, with the focus
shifting to the parliament's upper house, which is to meet with
Chernomyrdin on Thursday. If the upper house, made up of Russia's
increasingly powerful regional governors and legislative chiefs,
endorses Chernomyrdin, then his chances of approval in the lower
house would improve, said Vladimir Ryzhkov, the parliamentary
leader of Chernomyrdin's party, Our Home Is Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another option, Ryzhkov said, would be to float new names for
the job of prime minister _ Moscow's mayor, Yuri Luzhkov, and the
chairman of the upper house, Yegor Stroyev, have both been
mentioned _ for Yeltsin's consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Another top ally of Chernomyrdin, Aleksandr Shokhin, Tuesday
called on Yeltsin to initiate another round of consultations with
parliamentary leaders on the choice of a prime minister to replace
Sergei Kiriyenko, who was dismissed last week. ``The tension is
very high so far,'' said Shokhin.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin's determination to name an acting government even
without his nomination being approved could be interpreted as a
tactical move to get the political process off dead center or as a
desperate appeal for consensus in the face of a national crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday he expressed anger and frustration at the parliament's
leisurely pace. ``Nobody should get carried away so light-headedly
by this game,'' he said. ``What are we doing to the country, to its
people? Don't they feel pain, are they not concerned or offended by
what is happening in Russia?''
</P>
<P>
   As the politicians squabbled, the value of the ruble continued
to slip, falling to 11.8 on an electronic inter-bank currency
exchange, which, since the shutdown of the Moscow's main currency
exchange last week, has served as the best barometer of the
currency's worth.
</P>
<P>
   According to banking experts, the rate on the electronic
exchange is in effect dictated by market forces, and reflects the
refusal of the Central Bank of Russia to use its fast-dwindling
foreign currency reserves to defend the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   But uncertainty about the ruble's true worth continued to pummel
Russia's embattled consumers, who are seeing prices skittering all
over the place, jumping as high as 60 percent on some items in some
stores, although not in all. Some stores have stayed shut, as a way
of sidestepping the tricky question of what their merchandise is
worth.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With faith in the ruble falling fast, Russian consumers have
spent the last week sheltering their savings in everything from
gold to cars, and television sets to furniture. But now,
increasingly, the spending spree has moved on to foodstuffs, as
Russians, fearing the worst, flock to wholesale markets and large
supermarkets for the few bargains that remain.
</P>
<P>
   New stocks of imported goods have been held up in the wake of
the economic crisis, as importers halt shipments on orders that
have not been paid for. Russia, and Moscow in particular, has
become heavily dependent on imports for both food and consumer
goods, a situation which many see as fraught with danger given the
country's current shortage of money.
</P>
<P>
   At the regular weekend wholesale market in Zhukovsky, a town 20
miles outside Moscow, shoppers on Sunday were carting away boxes of
sunflower oil, macaroni, long-life milk and sugar, said Lida
Botcharova, a 48-year-old local resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were buying everything that will last,'' she said, noting
that prices had already jumped, from 10 rubles to 14 for a bottle
of sunflower oil, and from 10 to 19 rubles for a package of
detergent. Some goods had run out after a half day of frantic
sales, she said, ``Who knows what will be there next week.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of any concerted action by the government or the
Central Bank, experts Tuesday were predicting that the ruble will
only continue to slide, pushing prices up in a self-fulfilling
inflationary spiral made worse by merchants' speculating on popular
fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Central Bank has been doing in the past few days
defies description,'' said Dmitri Vasilyev, chairman of Russia's
Federal Securities Commission, at a press conference Tuesday.
``Shops are closed, there are no goods and no bank payments are
made. This should not happen.''
</P>
<P>
   At his government meeting Tuesday, Chernomyrdin said he was
preparing a series of ``tough and credible actions'' to restore
faith in the ruble, and the economy. ``We've had enough talk,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among his priorities he said were protecting savings accounts,
restoring the currency market, and preserving the banking system.
He also said he would move to simplify the Russian tax system, and
lower profit taxes in an attempt to stimulate local production.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no more margin for mistakes,'' he said. ``In this
situation, the government does not have a right not to work.''

EUROPEAN STOCKS HAVE A BAD DAY, BUT NOT AS BAD AS FEARED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ With a nervous eye on every tremor from Wall Street,
European stocks slumped, seesawed and stumbled through a day of
trading, to close well down from July highs but not quite so
stricken as some analysts had feared when markets opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come most of the way down and most of these European
stocks can rebound,'' said Mark Howdle, head of European strategy
at Salomon Smith Barney in London. ``It's not necessarily all doom
and gloom. People are perhaps beginning to believe the worst is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other analysts said the wild swings in the market
betokened what David Schwartz, a stock market historian, called
nervousness ``associated with bad times ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe's principal markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris opened
with rapid-fire losses that initially stripped more than $40
billion off the value of British shares and sent the FTSE index to
its lowest level since Jan. 13, reflecting what Udo Behrenwaldt,
manager of Deutsche Bank's DWS mutual funds arm in Frankfurt,
termed ``the shock from New York'' caused by the Dow Jones'
512-point loss Monday.
</P>
<P>
   British markets were closed Monday because of a public holiday
and took the brunt of early losses Tuesday with a 3 percent fall in
the FTSE index of leading London shares. The European declines
began to ease, however, when traders factored in the U.S. futures
data suggesting that Wall Street would rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Markets in Europe, like those in the United States, have been
sliding because of the Russian economic crisis and continued
worries about Asia, reinforced Tuesday by the imposition of
currency controls in Malaysia and falling stock markets in many
parts of the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the principal factor in the losses Tuesday was Wall Street,
analysts said. European markets gyrated in harness with U.S markets
as the Dow Jones fluctuated. ``It really does come down to Wall
Street,'' Howdle said. ``I don't think European markets can revive
independently.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time European markets closed, the Dow was up by 1
percent, erasing some early European losses but leaving most
markets down on the day. The FTSE closed 1.5 percent down; Paris'
CAC 40 index fell fractionally, and Frankfurt's DAX index closed 1
percent higher. Other markets in Zurich, Madrid and Milan all lost
on the day.
</P>
<P>
   Since Russia devalued the ruble and delayed repayments of debt
Aug. 19, European markets have suffered. The Frankfurt DAX is down
by almost 17 percent in the last two weeks _ a sign of Germany's
particular skittishness toward Russia _ while the London FTSE index
is down 15 percent from July highs.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's fall on Wall Street also sent the dollar down against
the German mark and Japanese yen _ a reflection of worries about
the repercussions of falling stock prices on the U.S. economy.
Michael Derks, chief bond strategist at Nomura International in
London, said any sign that the U.S. economy was ``losing its
sparkle'' would weaken the dollar. Since New York stocks began
their decline last week, the dollar has lost 4 percent against the
mark, 5 percent against the Swiss franc and 5 percent against the
ailing Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   There was no unanimity over whether European stocks had
definitively ended their bull run after the slide from earlier
highs, as some analysts suggested. ``I don't think anybody knows
how permanent it's going to be,'' Howdle said. But Derks said
European stocks were ``emphatically in a bear market.''

ACCUSED BACKERS OF ISLAMIC INSURGENTS GO ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A trial of 138 suspected supporters of Islamic
insurgents in Algeria, rounded up in police raids four years ago,
started Tuesday in a prison gymnasium south of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 20 of the defendants are in detention, and lawyers
for the others moved Tuesday for a court order to try the rest
separately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court should not allow a trial like this to take place in
a prison gymnasium under conditions that make it impossible for
defendants who have not yet got court-appointed lawyers to get a
fair trial,'' said Agnes Tricoire, a defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and other lawyers are considering boycotting the
trial, which is expected to take at least two months. Most of the
opening day was taken up with identification of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Chalabi, 43, charged with being a leader of a group
that recruited fighters for the insurgent cause from the large
Algerian community in France, described himself Tuesday as being of
``Muslim nationality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have nothing to do with the military junta,'' he said,
alluding to the military supporters of President Liamine Zeroual's
government. ``They are Algerians but I am a Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   French authorities have also accused him and members of the
Association of French Muslims of stockpiling arms and explosives
like those used in terrorist bombings here in 1995 by the Armed
Islamic Group, an opposition movement in Algeria that espouses
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Conflict between the Algerian authorities and their Islamic
opponents has taken an estimated 75,000 lives since 1992, when
fighting broke out after the army canceled legislative elections
that Muslim parties in the Islamic Salvation Front seemed likely to
win. The Armed Islamic Group emerged after the Front was banned.
</P>
<P>
   After bombs went off in the Paris subway in 1995, killing eight
people and wounding more than a hundred, the Armed Islamic Group
said it had carried out the attacks to force France to cut off
trade, aid and diplomatic links with Algeria.
</P>
<P>
   France's relations have been difficult with Algeria, a former
colony, since the bitter war for independence, which cost the lives
of 20,000 French men and women and hundreds of thousands of
Algerians. After independence in 1962, hundreds of thousands more,
French and Algerian, were resettled in low-income housing
developments in France, and Muslim neighborhoods of those families
and their descendants now ring Paris and other large French cities.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that troubled milieu, prosecutors said, that most of
those who went on trial Tuesday were arrested in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   French authorities have said a few of them took military
training in camps like the one in Afghanistan that was attacked by
U.S. cruise missiles last month. But the French have never publicly
made a direct connection between terrorists here and Osama bin
Laden, the Saudi millionaire who the United States says backed the
bombing of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Other defendants charged with criminal association with a
terrorist enterprise, punishable by up to 10 years in prison,
include Mourad Tacine, who is said to have prepared false papers
for fighters recruited in France for the Islamic cause in Algeria,
and Mohammed Kerrouch, an Algerian arrested in Britain two years
ago and extradited to France.

MARKET FLUCTUATIONS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY
PRIVATIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Critics of privatizing Social Security said Tuesday
that gyrations on Wall Street are poking holes in the idea that the
stock market provides a substitute for the federally administered
and guaranteed retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you turn the system over to individuals to put their money
(into stocks), they're very vulnerable to this kind of thing,''
said Robert Ball, Social Security Administration commissioner from
1962 to 1973 and member of a federal advisory council that last
year issued a report on Social Security's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows whether it's going to stay down or go up. There's
no way of knowing. And that's not good for basic retirement
protection,'' Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   .MDNM/With the trust fund scheduled to lurch into the red in
2032, privatization has surfaced as an enhancement to the current
Social Security system. In place since 1935, that system depends on
workers and their employers paying into the trust fund to finance
pensions for retirees. About 44 million people collect Social
Security today.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Social Security trust fund is invested in
Treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization plans vary in their content, but many of them
involve investment of a portion of retirement savings in the stock
market. Future retirees could watch their money grow on Wall Street
instead of lying fallow in the trust fund, proponents argue.
</P>
<P>
   An example: The 1994-1996 federal advisory council included a
proposal for a two-tiered system in which a person would pay into
(and ultimately receive) traditional Social Security and proceeds
of a ``Personal Savings Account'' _ investments on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization of one kind or another is supported by an array of
groups, many of them with conservative connections. On Capitol
Hill, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, is a leading advocate of
privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, have argued that fluctuations such as Monday's
512.61 drop in the Dow Jones industrial average make any reliance
on Wall Street tenuous at best for the vast majority of retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Under privatization, ``someone who decided to cash in their
retirement savings a few months ago would have accumulated
significantly more than someone who pulls out now,'' said Tom
Matzzie, Social Security project coordinator at the
Washington-based Institute for America's Future. ``That tremendous
variability means there would be less income for many people if we
were relying on the stock market to provide Social Security
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   While the market can drive up a beneficiary's income in good
times, it lacks the fundamental reliability of the current system,
said Dean Baker, an economist at the Washington-based Progressive
Policy Institute and author of the 1997 book, ``Saving Social
Security with Stocks: The Promises Don't Add Up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With Social Security, you have a long history: Sixty years and
they never missed a check,'' he said. ``The market could go through
a slump, and you end up losing a major proportion of your
retirement income.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Thau, president of Third Millennium, an organization of
youthful ``generation Xers'' concerned that Social Security and
Medicare will dry up before they reach retirement age, countered
that daily, weekly or yearly fluctuations have not diminished the
stock market's steady growth over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even with the recent gyrations, we shouldn't lose sight of the
fact that compared to where the market was 20 years ago, it is
still a huge success.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow average topped 1,000 for the first time in 1972, only to
drop down to 616 in the 1974 recession. On Tuesday, the Dow
recovered 288.36 of Monday's 512.61 loss to close at 7,827.43.
</P>
<P>
   But Ball said that individuals dependent on the stock market for
the their retirement income would find themselves at the mercy of
how Wall Street is doing at the time when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't wait,'' he said. ``They retire at a certain time,
and as they retire, where the stock market is at that time will
determine their retirement income. So if the stock market has
dropped 20 percent, they can't wait it out until it goes up again.

KBIG GIVES A LOCAL SPIN TO DELILAH LUKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; For an increasing number of loyal local
listeners, KBIG's Delilah Luke is a shoulder to cry on, a caring
friend with good advice each weeknight from 7 p.m. to midnight.
</P>
<P>
   So, it was a surprise to learn the syndicated program, carried
by more than 160 stations around the nation, originates in Seattle.
Thanks to sharp production at KBIG's Glendale studios and
state-of-the-art satellite technology, Luke can refer to Los
Angeles news and events and instantly insert those items into the
KBIG-FM (104.3) show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do special stuff for each market,'' Luke explained Tuesday.
``The people who run KBIG are very professional, and there's an
executive producer we work with on a nightly basis who gives us
updated information about everything going on in L.A. so we can put
custom stuff in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the show sounds mellow and relaxed, it's timed
down to a fraction of a second because the commercial breaks have
to be an exact length. So, it's very, very complicated. Some
stations just hook it up to the satellite and walk away. But KBIG
spends a lot of time making it sound like part of the station.''
</P>
<P>
   The show started in syndication in 1996; KBIG picked up
``Delilah'' six months ago. Along with dispensing advice, Luke
spins the station's popular mix of adult contemporary hits and
invites listeners to make dedications.
</P>
<P>
   Luke has been hosting this style of call-in show for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the same issues _ people call who are joyous, who
overcame an incredible obstacle, or it's romance problems involving
a mate or relationship,'' she said. ``The one thing I try and do
with every caller is make sure at the end that they know they are
valid and have worth. And even though they may be making bad
choices, they're a good person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because beating someone up emotionally is not going to force
them to change.''
</P>
<P>
   KFI AXES TAMMY BRUCE: Controversial talk host Tammy Bruce on
Friday sent a message to friends that she had been fired from
KFI-AM (640) after management taped a late-night apology for
remarks she made about about comedian Bill Cosby and his wife,
Camille.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's e-mailed message said that on the day of the apology,
KFI officials wrote her a letter advising that ``my on-air services
would no longer be required.''
</P>
<P>
   KFI program director David Hall could not be reached by press
time Tuesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce said she and her lawyers would hold a press conference
this week to announce specific action against the talk station.
</P>
<P>
   She added that the American Federation of Television and Radio

   GOVERNOR-TEXAS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ This might be remembered as the year Texas
elected two governors. It is a scenario that some political
analysts say should be taken seriously: Popular Gov. George W. Bush
easily wins re-election, setting the stage for a presidential bid
in 2000; then a nation eager for new direction after eight
sometimes scandalous years of the Clinton administration catapults
the affable Texan with the familiar name into the White House. That
means that the winner of the Nov. 3 lieutenant governor's race
between Democrat John Sharp and Republican Rick Perry could move
into the Governor's Mansion on or before Jan. 20, 2001. By JOHN

&HT;        AS DEBATE BEGINS, COMPACT OPPONENTS LOOK TO CLINTON
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Sept. 1 -- Opponents of storing low-level nuclear
waste from Maine and Vermont's private nuclear reactors in a small
west Texas town trained their political pressure Tuesday on a new
target: the White House.
</P>
<P>
   With a Senate vote on the Maine-Vermont-Texas compact expected
to come Wednesday, Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., led critics of the
deal at an hourlong rally calling on President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore to take a stand against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a White House and an administration that talks about
civil rights,'' Wellstone said, alluding to his charge that the
waste site was chosen because it is a poor Hispanic town. ``We need
for them (Clinton and Gore) to speak out,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   His comments were echoed by other environmentalists, marking the
first time that the compact's opponents have publicly turned toward
the White House for support. Implicit in their remarks is the
expectation that they do not have the votes to stop the Senate from
approving the compact, the final congressional action needed to
send the bill to Clinton following the House's 305-116 approval in
July.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, Maine and Vermont would pay $25 million each to
help build a storage site in Sierra Blanca, Tex., a low-income town
with a population that is two-thirds Hispanic. The site would be
used for storing low-level nuclear waste from private reactors in
the three states, including from the defunct Maine Yankee in
Wiscasset.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has not issued any official statement taking a
position on the compact, but its supporters, including the entire
Maine delegation, have operated under the impression that Clinton
would sign the compact. Nine other similar compacts have been
approved, covering 41 states.
</P>
<P>
   They contend that the site would be the safest way of storing
the waste, which would include scrap metal and workers' gloves from
the nuclear reactors, as well medical gloves used in radiation
treatments at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Selection for the site is determined entirely by Texas. Sierra
Blanca has fewer than 10 inches of rainfall a year and is one of
the least densely populated areas in the state, two key factors in
its selection, compact supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arguments Sen. Wellstone has been making may sound good,
but they don't add up,'' said Dave Lackey, spokesman for Sen.
Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Wellstone would approve the compact if two of his accepted
amendments were included -- both of which were approved but
stripped from compromise legislation between the House and Senate.
One limits nuclear waste at the site to the three states, and the
other allows Sierra Blanca residents to file civil rights suits if
they feel their town was targeted because it was poor and mostly
Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   But Gov. Angus King, as well as the other two governors, oppose
those amendments because any changes to the compact would have to
then be approved by all three state legislatures, further delaying
the process -- as would civil rights lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In shifting his focus toward the White House, Wellstone
acknowledged that it would be ``an uphill battle'' to win his fight
in the Senate, and that his best chance was to convince Clinton to
wield his veto pen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really have not been visible on this,'' Wellstone said of
Clinton and Gore, who have tried to trumpet environmentalism in
their administration. ``They really should be, given their
priorities.''

 &HT;    ``Guinness'' show of the summer
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All it took was a constant barrage of promos of that guy
sticking a drill up his nose.
</P>
<P>
   Grossed you out, didn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you saw the man trying to stuff a record number of
hamburgers down his own throat. Or those strange people trying to
see who could spit crickets the farthest.
</P>
<P>
   You may claim you don't watch Fox's ``Guinness World Records:
Primetime,'' but the truth is even if you don't your friends
probably do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinness'' is emerging as the TV show of the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some 14 million viewers tuned in last week, making it the No. 7
show in the country. And on Tuesday, Fox picked up the reality
series for a full season order.
</P>
<P>
   It'll continue airing at 9 p.m. Tuesdays until the debut of the
new Fox series ``Brimstone'' on Oct. 27. Then ``Guinness'' will
find a new home as a midseason replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinness''' dominance on Tuesday nights is staggering.
Nationally, it beats everything in its time period. Heck, it beats
everything on every network in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``King of the Hill''? Ha! ``Guinness'' doubles its viewership.
The shows it beats are endless. ``Home Improvement,'' ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' ``Maximum Bob,'' ``Mad About You,'' ``3rd Rock From the
Sun,'' the Tuesday night ``Frasier,'' hippy ``Dawson's Creek,''
hippier ``Just Shoot Me.''

the unpaved road. Her destination was a primitive fish camp on a

 &HT;    CLINTON'S POLITICAL FATE TIED TO THE ECONOMY, EXPERTS SAY
 &HT;    640&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton got a bear hug in Moscow and a
bull run on Wall Street on Tuesday, and it's pretty clear which one
he found more bracing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously,'' Clinton said at his summit with Russian President
Boris Yeltsin, ''it's always more enjoyable when our stock market
goes up than when it goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the strong economy and stock market, after all, that has
helped Clinton weather the Monica Lewinsky sex and deception
scandal with his high job approval ratings remarkably intact.
</P>
<P>
   ''The biggest single source of Clinton's popularity is the
economy,'' said political scientist Darrell West, ''which means
that if the economy does start to soften this fall, his numbers are
going to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   While it has slowed in recent months, the economy remains in
comparatively good shape.
</P>
<P>
   But economists fear the summer stock swoon could breed pessimism
among consumers, more than 70 million of whom have sizable amounts
of their household worth tied up in stocks. That, in turn, could
slow an economy that's been expanding for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   It's already a precarious moment for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is preparing to deliver the
report of his inquiry into the Lewinsky scandal to a Congress that
will, depending largely on Starr's findings, consider whether to
launch impeachment proceedings against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton's in a very risky situation now,'' said West, a
professor of political science at Brown University in Providence,
R.I. ''The economy is softening and the Starr report is still
hanging out there in the wind, and both of them may fall in at the
same time and produce devastating numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion polls have documented a dramatic split between
how Americans feel about Clinton as a person and their regard for
the job he's doing as president.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted two weeks ago by the Pew Research Center for
the People and the Press, for example, found that 62 percent of
Americans don't like Clinton as a person, 43 percent think he lacks
respect by global leaders and 37 percent said he doesn't have the
moral standing necessary to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   In the same survey, however, 62 percent of those polled said
they approved of the job Clinton is doing as president. Asked to
explain why, one-third of his backers cited his job overseeing a
thriving economy.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests to some analysts that Clinton's job approval
ratings would be extremely vulnerable to an economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's been the foundation of his approval and the
foundation's gone, then the approval's gone,'' said George Edwards,
director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&AMP;M
University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now the economy is Bill Clinton's life raft, and the
deck is starting to feel wet,'' said Jack Pitney, a former
Republican National Committee researcher who now teaches American
government at Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif. ''A
lot of people are saying, 'He's a bad person, but he's handling the
economy well.' If he's not running the economy well, all you're
left with is a bad person.''
</P>
<P>
   Public perceptions, moreover, could dramatically influence a
Congress considering whether to impeach or censure the president.
</P>
<P>
   All 435 members of the House, which would vote on whether to
impeach, are up for re-election in November, as is one-third of the
Senate, which would conduct a trial of the president if the House
approves a bill of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   With the verdict of the voters looming, it's hard for analysts
to envision impeachment proceedings against a president with job
approval ratings topping 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't impeach a popular president without risking a major
backlash for yourself,'' said West. ''But if his numbers go down
his political vulnerability goes up, just because nobody is afraid
of him.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   It's conceivable that a U.S. economic downturn could focus
national attention away from the Lewinsky scandal and back to the
kitchen table issues of jobs, income and inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment proceedings, moreover, are not a popularity contest,
so much as a sober constitutional process, said Charles Jones,
professor emeritus of political science at the University of
Wisconsin in Madison.
</P>
<P>
   With the economy so far continuing to pump along and Starr's
report still not in, Jones said, ''It's a little early to tell what
kind of consequences there are going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, Jones said, is that there have been few better
indicators of a president's job approval rating over the decades
than the performance of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder, then, that a scandal-tainted president has an eye
trained on Wall Street, even as he wanders far from home.

 &HT;    Sometimes, investors just can't help themselves
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles P. Kindleberger wrote the book on manias, panics and
crashes, but while he sees what's happening in the stock market now
as ``both a mania and a panic,'' he doesn't envision another crash.
</P>
<P>
   Kindleberger, 87, a retired economist and historian at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said Tuesday the ``herd
behavior'' that has whipsawed Wall Street lately resembles many
financial manias and panics, including those of 1929 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in a bubble for two years, and this kind of
volatility is to be expected,'' said Kindleberger, whose book
``Manics, Panics and Crashes'' was a big hit in the late 1970s. It
showed that investors big and small have periodically tended to
demonstrate irrational collective behavior, whether in selling or
buying.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1630s, for example, people in Holland and elsewhere in
Europe mortgaged their homes to buy tulip bulbs. The mania went
bust in 1637, when people realized the obvious _ tulips produced
seeds, and thus no bulb was unique and worth the prices being paid.
Europe was thrown into depression.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bubble burst in the early 1700s when it dawned on
French investors that gold nuggets didn't come out of the ground in
Louisiana with every rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a great deal of follow-the-leader going on in the
stock market,'' Kindleberger said. ``The lemmings don't strike me
as rational. The market went down big (Monday), and now it's up big
(Tuesday).''
</P>
<P>
   But rationality often has little to do with the behavior of
investors, who're known for buying or selling on nothing but rumor,
or just to follow a crowd, said Dr. Edward Hirt, a psychologist and
expert on collective human behavior at Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's been happening on Wall Street resembles contagion,'' he
said. ``It's like a virus, and you can catch it. People look to
other people to tell them when to buy, or when to sell. And just
the markets going down can be enough to make more people sell,
which can become self-fulfilling.''
</P>
<P>
   Many stockbrokers, however, contend their clients have become
more alert but haven't been caught up emotionally in the huge rises
and falls of the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting about four or five times as many calls from
clients, but only one has been panicky,'' said Donnie Golson, 50,
of Prudential Securities in Atlanta and a veteran of 25 years in
the business. ``It's the uncertainty about Asia, the collapse in
Russia, but it doesn't compare to '87. People seem pretty calm for
the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Broker Gary Alexander of Interstate/Johnson Lane in Atlanta said
his clients don't seem frightened by the violent movements in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting calls at home from people who want me to buy for
them, not sell,'' said Alexander, 52, a broker for 30 years. ``More
people are calling, yes, but they just want reassurance. They are
aware that the basic underlying trend is good _ low inflation, low
interest rates and a moderately expanding economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Harlow, a physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory
and an expert in crowd behavior, said he's always amazed that
``emotional responses to things can suddenly take over that have
nothing to do with rationality. What's happening is like a mob. One
person does something and another sees him and does it and so on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a piece of the pie, in retirement plans,
401(k)s or in actual stocks,'' Hirt said. ``So everybody is more
aware of what's said on CNN, live, about the market.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, it's not human nature to take unexpected events
calmly or rationally, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the market tanks, it's an admission that something scary
and out of your control is happening. And this makes you act, a lot
of people, like other people are acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, market volatility _ whether up or down _ undermines
``belief systems that say we have control over the future,'' Hirt
said. ``This is scary. It makes you realize you have little
control. It opens you to the unpleasant thought that unpleasant
things can happen to you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Kindleberger, for now, isn't worried about a crash. But he
cautions that not even the smartest analyst on Wall Street can say
with any degree of certainty what's going to happen next week or
next month, so forecasts should be taken with a grain of salt.
</P>
<P>
   Or as John Kenneth Galbraith, the famous Harvard economist, put
it, investors should remember one thing: There are only two kinds
of forecasters _ those who don't know, and those who don't know
they don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no time for panic,'' Kindleberger said.

 &HT;    Tale for out times
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lee Jenkins, a broker with Raymond James &AMP; Associates,
</P>
<P>
   tells an amusing story for out times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy was shining my shoes at the stand the other day, and
when he learned that I was a broker he started to tell me about
good investments. He was really up on several
</P>
<P>
   high-tech stocks and kept telling me about how they could not
miss... When I gave him his tip, I felt like asking for his
card...''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins smiled, recognizing that his true story underlined key
assumptions by many small investors and camp followers of the bull
market that hit the ground this week:
</P>
<P>
   Growth is in their air, everybody knows it, even if you don't
make your living on investments. And you better climb aboard before
you get left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last year my job has been two-fold,'' Jenkins said.
``Most of this year it has been to prevent what call greed _
loading up on the hot stocks in the market,
</P>
<P>
   loved because of their showy performance, even though they
lacked basic strength or even profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``And in the last few days it has been to hold hands with those
who are scared or just need encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a wise broker, Jenkins never says ``I told you so,'' but
he said he will certainly use the huge market fall as a teaching
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost in this market and so did my clients, even those who
take our advice and mix their investments among stocks, bonds and
other instruments,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a way this week was good for us. It showed that even in
an economy that is fundamentally sound, forces from various
directions can lead to a fall _ and so good strategy ALWAYS comes
into play.''
</P>
<P>
   Preferring to steer his clients toward fundamental investing
instead of market gamesmanship, Jenkins said he seldom touted a
high-tech stock beyond the proven ones like
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Intel and Hewlett Packard ``that are an integral part
of all my clients' portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the age and situation of his clients, he said he
usually encouraged them to find a mix of 60 to 80 percent stocks or
stock-based mutual funds, with the rest devoted to bonds and cash
savings. And even among the stocks he said he recommended a mix
across industries, including foreign securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everyone who has followed that kind of plan over the
last five years probably is considerably ahead of the game,''
Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to explain what he meant by preventing greed among
clients, Jenkins said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly all who open an account say they would be delighted to
see a 10 percent growth in their investments, and ecstatic over 20
percent. But then when they reach 20 percent they get driven to
find high risk stocks to push toward 30 percent. I always tell them
that gambling is for Vegas...''
</P>
<P>
   As a professional, he said, he believes that the market drop
will provoke more thoughtful investing all around and this probably
means that risky plays will be far less popular in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new technology has encouraged and enabled many more people
to be their investment strategists,'' Jenkins said, ``and that will
continue. But many more people will see some use in professional
guidance or in closer study of thevarious investment instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   The thrust of Jenkins's message was that many of the small
stocks without a strong record will likely be slow to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, I think the market as a whole will come back slowly
through the rest of this year,'' Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom lines is that this correction has probably been a
best friend to young investors,'' he said, ``because it
</P>
<P>
   has been educational.

 &HT;    Mortgage interest rates are at the lowest level this decade.
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Vitner does not regard the recent firestorm in the stock
market as a detriment to home buying. Neither, it seems, do most
others in the mortgage business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to use cliches like `There has never been a better time
to buy a house,' but I will say it is a real good time,'' said
Vitner, vice president and economist with First Union National Bank
in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage interest rates are at the lowest level this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing out that mortgage rates are related to long-term bond
yields, not directly to the stock market, the experts agreed that
for the foreseeable future, houses will remain affordable. Falling
stock prices have sent bond prices higher as bonds become more
attractive to investors.
</P>
<P>
   When bond prices rise, as they are doing now, their yields fall.
But mortgage rates don't react ``to every little swing'' in the
bond market, Vitner continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job growth and income growth are still strong, and houses _
especially new ones _ are affordable. Even when this stock market
flap settles down, many consumers will still be sitting on sizeable
gains,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates might decline further, the experts agreed, but
the fall would be slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Federal Reserve will act to lower rates fairly
soon,'' said Charles Floyd, a real estate professor at the Terry
College of Business at the University of Georgia. ``I won't guess
how much mortgage rates might drop before they bottom out. They are
already extremely low.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Tutterow, chairman of the Department of Economics and
Finance at Kennesaw State University, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember there has been a slow downward trend in mortgage
rates since early spring of 1997. Furthermore, in Atlanta, we have
been below 7 percent for several quarters already. Any stimulus ...
would be mild.''
</P>
<P>
   Except on the refinance market. A drop could spawn a new
generation of people wanting to save a few dollars a month by
refinancing their loans, Tutterow speculated.

 &HT;    Analysts are divided over Wall Street's longer-term outlook.
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors can look for more near-term rallies following
Tuesday's stunning stock market comeback, but beyond that analysts
are divided over Wall Street's longer-term outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Citing strong economic fundamentals, bullish analysts argue that
the latest selloff, which sent the Dow Jones industrial average
tumbling more than 19 percent, is enough to wash out speculative
price excesses inthe market.
</P>
<P>
   In this view, bear markets typically don't occur when the
economy is not in a recession. And as of now, at least, most
economists look for continued economic growth with mininal
inflation, falling interest rates and little long-term damage from
foreign economic trouble-spots.
</P>
<P>
   This is not necessarly so, say the reinvigorated bears. They
contend that stock prices got much too frothy in the 1990s' bull
market to be corrected by even a 20 percent selloff, especially in
light of expectations of slower corporate profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Investors can only hope that the parallels between this week's
trading and last Oct. 27 and 28 would not stop with Tuesday's
rebound. Both times, the Dow fell more than 500 points only to be
followed next day by big buying rallies.
</P>
<P>
   From the Oct. 27 low, the Dow went on to add close to 2,200
points, or 30 percent, peaking July 17 at an all-time high of
9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
   What both camps could agree on was that, after the selloff since
July 17, stocks are likely to trend higher in a series of volatile
rallies and setbacks for weeks _ maybe months_ to come, at which
time stocks will sell off again and retest Monday's lows.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Bloch, a technical analyst and chief market analyst for
Raymond James &AMP; Associates in St. Petersburg, looks for the bull
market to resume its climb. He called Monday's selloff, which sent
the Dow Jones industrial average plummeting by 513 points, was ``a
classic selling climax.''
</P>
<P>
   Bloch said the two sessions had all the ingredients of a
``climactic low,'' including ``very high volume, tremendous
volatility and selling pressure in strong (blue-chip) stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts caution investors not to expect a repeat of
the subsequent 30 percent surge in blue-chip stocks that followed
the Oct. 27 selloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a minor correction, this is a major setback,''
Atlanta money manager Harold W. Gourgues Jr. saids of the selloff
that started in mid-July. ``We'be better get prepared for setbacks
and rallies for quite a while to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say a rally such as Tuesday's 288-point gain in the Dow
Jones industrial average is not unusual following a dip as big as
Monday's 513-point slide.

`WACKOS' LINE UP AGAIN FOR `TITANIC' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - You'd think that since everyone knew how the story
ended going in and that most of the world had seen the movie
already anyway, there wouldn't be much of a crowd to buy
``Titanic'' when the video wenton sale.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why you don't run a major Hollywood studio. When the
clock struck 12:00:01 a.m. Tuesday, video stores officially began
selling the most popular movie of all time. One was the Blockbuster
Video at Southern and McClintock in Tempe, Ariz., to the delight of
the 150 or so people lined up to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, they weren't the only ones: Paramount Home Video
shipped 20 million to 26 million videocassettes of the 11-time
Oscar winner to video stores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But isn't it strange to feel like you have to buy one the second
it's released?
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was psycho,'' Nellie Cho, a 20-year-old Arizona
State University student, said as she waited in line. ``I wasn't
going to do this. But here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Here indeed, waiting with her friend, Michelle Ferrara, who
harbored a similar sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like a wacko,'' said Ferrara, a 19-year-old ASU
student. ``But it's fun. It's all about being a college student.
I'm allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   By all means. Never mind that Ferrara thought they would be the
only people there. Never mind that they both had early classes
Tuesday. Never mind that Ferrara had seen ``Titanic'' seven times
(Cho a mere five) already. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DiCrush lives on
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
On second thought, (beginital) do (endital) mind that. The movie
lasts 3 hours and 14 minutes. That means Ferrara has spent just
short of an entire day watching Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet
frolicking on a ship that hits an iceberg and sinks. (Hope that
doesn't ruin it for you. Oh yeah, HE DIES AT THE END. And Rosebud
is a sled.)
</P>
<P>
   What is it about ``Titanic'' that makes people keep watching it
again and again? DiCaprio is a big part of the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have a real big crush'' on DiCaprio, Amy Bergstedt
said. ``The other parts were good, but I liked the parts where they
showed his face. I wish I was Kate in that car.'' (If you haven't
seen it, think steamy love scene.)
</P>
<P>
   Bergstedt (she's seen ``Titanic'' three times) and her friend,
Natalie Krongaard (six), planned to take the movie home and watch
it immediately, which meant not getting to sleep before 4 a.m. Both
ASU students, they had classes Tuesday morning. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget school tomorrow,'' Bergstedt said, a time-honored
response.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster stores stayed open till 2 a.m. to sell the video and
offered several promotions. A local radio station hosted a
pre-release party at this particular outlet; free pizza and sodas
were served. Just before midnight, Blockbuster employees brought
out several blue-striped cardboard boxes stuffed with copies of
``Titanic,'' priced at $24.99 each. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Leo look
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tyler Nielson was on hand for a DiCaprio look-alike contest. Good
idea, since he is a dead ringer for the star, right down to the
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got my hair cut a couple of weeks ago,'' Nielson said.
``It accidentally turned out like this. When he was done, I was
like, `Could you make it a little less Leo?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him, no. Nielson won the contest, good for a year's
worth of Blockbuster rentals as well as a copy of ``Titanic.'' This
despite heavy competition from a raucous I-remember-my-first-beer
bunch pushing its own candidate, even though the guy looked like an
extra from ``Dazed and Confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after midnight, Chris Stoker showed up and groaned at
the size of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost don't want to go in there,'' she said. ``It'll be
there tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. It's tempting to shout, ``Get a life!'' but having
once stayed up till midnight to buy Nine Inch Nails' ``The
Downward'' ``Spiral'' early, I'm aware of how inviting such a mob
scene can be. Hype is intoxicating. It sounds crazy, but suddenly,
it's important to be a part of it, to be first (or at least close).
Otherwise, you feel like you're missing out.
</P>
<P>
   After hesitating a minute or two, Stoker got in line.
</P>
<P>
   One more copy, sold. &QL;

CLINTON TO RUSSIANS: NO EASY ESCAPE FROM FINANCIAL CATASTROPHE

 (JT)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton delivered a sober lecture to Russian
leaders and the Russian people Tuesday about the hard realities of
capitalism and the price of international support for relief from
Russia's current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with President Boris Yeltsin and the temporary
caretakers of Russia's paralyzed political and economic
institutions, and in a speech to students at a Moscow university,
Clinton warned that there is no easy escape from the financial
catastrophe that has closed banks, left millions of workers unpaid
and caused the collapse of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are enormous,'' Clinton told a group of students
and young business leaders at the Moscow State University for
International Relations Tuesday afternoon. ``Every choice Russia
makes today may have consequences for years and years to come.
Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not
believe there are any painless solutions; and, indeed, an attempt
to avoid difficult solutions may only prolong and worsen the
present challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   The first day of Clinton's two-day visit to Moscow was markedly
muted, fitting for a summit whose purpose was far from clear, given
Russia's turmoil and its lack of a functioning government.
Yeltsin's precarious political position and Clinton's unresolved
legal problems at home added to the sense of gloom enveloping the
summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meetings with Yeltsin were businesslike and utterly
lacking in the back-slapping bonhomie that has characterized
several of their earlier meetings, officials said. The state dinner
Yeltsin hosted Tuesday night _ affairs which in years past have
lasted well past midnight _ broke up at 9:15 p.m. after barely an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   The only concrete accords to be announced at the summit are
agreements to reduce both nations' plutonium stockpiles and to
share data on ballistic missile launches. Both were negotiated
weeks ago and do not represent major arms-control breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   American officials considered canceling the long-planned summit
because the prospects for meaningful progress were nil, but decided
late last week to proceed because they concluded that abandoning
the meeting would heap insult on Russia's multiple internal
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The day was drab and rainy, unseasonably cold even for late
summer in Moscow. Clinton's solemn speech at the university _ the
only extended public remarks he will deliver on the visit _ matched
the mood of this sullen city. While he offered words of
encouragement and vows of friendship, the message was blunt and
bleak. Russia's creditors and its international partners, the
president said, will not tolerate a return to state control of
important industries, efforts to escape financial hardship by
printing rubles or special favors for cronies of powerful figures
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to create a new Russia that benefits all
responsible citizens of this country,'' Clinton said in a 35-minute
address that was not once interrupted by applause. ``How do you get
there? I do not believe it is by reverting to the failed policies
of the past. I do not believe it is by stopping the reform process
in midstream, with a few Russians doing very well but far more
struggling to provide for their families. I believe you will create
the conditions of growth if _ but only if _ you continue to move
decisively along the path of democratic, market-oriented,
constructive revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then spelled out what he called ``the rules of the
road'' that Russia must follow if it wishes to become a modern
state in the global economy. They include a fair and consistent tax
collection system, anti-inflationary government monetary policy,
legal protections for property owners and investors, steps to halt
accelerating capital flight and an end to sweetheart deals for the
tycoons who dominate an increasing share of Russia's legitimate and
black-market economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not radical theories,'' Clinton said. ``They are
simply facts proven by experience. How Russia reacts to them will
fundamentally affect your future.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand-picked audience in the hall already agreed with most of
what Clinton had to say, said Yekaterina Drozdova, a recent
graduate of the university now working for the U.S. Agency for
International Development in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people present are already for all of that,'' she
said. ``He might better try to impose his influence on the powerful
structures.''
</P>
<P>
   She also mildly criticized Clinton for not speaking more
forthrightly about political developments inside Russia. ``The
international community should express an opinion on what is going
on in our country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Chernyshev, a physiologist in his late 20s, also agreed
with most of Clinton's views. ``What would you expect him to say?''
Chernyshev said. ``It was all kind of predictable. I think it's
just true.''

 MOSCOW: just true.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton's message to Yeltsin and to Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
acting premier, echoed that of his speech, according to Strobe
Talbott, the deputy secretary of state who attended the morning and
luncheon sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said that the United States would refrain from offering
comment on Yeltsin's effort to piece together a government from the
battling powers of the lower house of Parliament or Duma, regional
leaders and business interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have assiduously maintained our respect for the sovereignty
of the Russian democratic political system,'' Talbott said. ``We're
not going to pick and choose among Russian individual political
figures, Russia's parties, factions in the current Duma, not least,
to be very honest with you, because I'm not sure it would be
helpful to those we wanted to help for us to create a hierarchy of
whose policies we think most promising.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added, a return to control by Communist or other
reactionary forces would not be greeted kindly by the United States
and other western nations. ''The president said very clearly today
in his speech at the institute that he hoped and believed that
Russia would keep moving forward and not go back and try policies
that have so clearly and dramatically and disastrously failed in
the past,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's day in Moscow began with a brief arrival ceremony at
Vnukovo II airport, where he was met by Chernomyrdin. Clinton and
Chernomyrdin held preliminary discussions in the president's car on
the way into Moscow, where they talked chiefly about Russia's
current economic challenges, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton placed a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier along
the Kremlin wall, and then proceeded to a 90-minute private meeting
with Yeltsin in the Russian president's ornate oval-shaped study.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin greeted the American delegation, which included
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Bill Richardson, the
secretary of energy; Samuel R. Berger, the national security
adviser; Gene Sperling, director of the national economic council,
and Lawrence Summers, the deputy secretary of the treasury. Yeltsin
presented his visitors with a replica of an American flag given by
an American delegation to Russia in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin met privately, then held a working lunch
attended by about a half-dozen senior officials on each side. Apart
from the economic and political crises gripping the country, the
leaders discussed the ethnic bloodshed in Kosovo, Iraqi
non-compliance with international arms monitoring and American
concerns about Russian missile technology sales to Iran, according
to Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton
visited Elementary School No. 19, on the eastern bank of the Moscow
River, to mark the official opening of Russian schools.
</P>
<P>
   A group of well-scrubbed youngsters warmly applauded the
Clintons and presented them with a doll and a plaque. Igor Dyomin,
7, wearing a sailor suit, performed a version of the high-kicking
Cossack dance, to the delight of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks, Clinton referred to Russia's current troubles
and praised the courage and patience the Russian people have shown
in earlier crises. He encouraged the students to explore the
Internet, work to repair the environment and expand the frontiers
of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   And he said: ``I know that Russian students love to read and are
proud of your country's great writers. A teacher here in Moscow
asked her first grade class why they thought reading was important.
One girl stood up and answered, `You can read any book. You can
read Pushkin.' No one in the first grade in my country is reading
Pushkin.''
</P>
<P>
   The children laughed.

BATTERED AT HOME, ASIAN INVESTORS NOW FEAR FURTHER FALLOUT FROM
U.S.   
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL WuDUNN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ After being battered by tumbling currencies and stock
markets for more than a year, Asian investors are now looking
fearfully at the turmoil on Wall Street and wondering whether they
are going to be hit yet again.
</P>
<P>
   Asian markets are bracing for a double whammy: slower economic
growth in the West from falling markets there and a return to Asia
of the firestorm that started here in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a matter of the response of Wall Street to
global events,'' said Paul Schulte, regional strategist at ING
Barings Securities in Hong Kong. ``It's that it just comes around
again and bites Asia in the behind.''
</P>
<P>
   That apprehension was visible Tuesday in jittery markets
throughout the region. Japan's Nikkei index of 225 issues managed
to eke out a small gain, rising 1.86 percent, to 14,369.63. But
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 2.92 percent, to 7,062.47,
after the government stayed away from buying stocks for a second
day.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser was Malaysia, where the government imposed capital
controls and said it would fix the ringgit, its currency, to the
dollar by the end of the year. The Malaysian stock market fell
13.27 percent, to 262.70. The market fell 3.86 percent, to 823.33
in Singapore, and 1.6 percent, to 211.09 in Thailand. The market in
the Philippines ended the day largely where it began.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very bleak picture,'' said Simon Mahadevan Flint,
head of research at IDEA, an independent economic consulting firm
in Singapore. ``That's really reflected by what Malaysia has done.
It's an act of desperation in a very, very difficult time.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors were taken by surprise by the Malaysian government's
move to restrict trading of the ringgit in offshore markets and
essentially retreat to the kind of currency regime that helped
bring about the country's turmoil in the first place. ``We feel
that we should control foreign exchange to the point that the
ringgit cannot be traded at all,'' said Malaysia's prime minister,
Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Malaysia said it would not recognize trading
of Malaysian shares in Singapore. Economists said that the
government seemed to be trying to build a wall around Malaysia's
economy to reduce interest rates, prevent capital flight and better
control its economy.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Malaysia's moves may help stabilize currencies in
the region by removing Malaysia from the ring of countries
competing to export their inexpensive products _ made cheaper
through repeated depreciation of currencies _ to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Other countries, however, are unlikely to copy Malaysia. Some,
like Thailand and South Korea, are inching toward progress.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest worries in Asia, however, is deflation _ the
further falling of prices on everything from stocks to socks, from
paper to property. Moreover, the wealth erased in stock markets in
the West could come back to haunt Asia. As Western consumers with
less cash to spare buy fewer products made in Thailand, South Korea
and other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest risk is deflation,'' Flint said. ``What people
are worried about is global asset deflation.''
</P>
<P>
   In such markets, the little investors usually survive if they
stay on the sidelines, and this is virtually what Tung Chee-hwa,
chief executive of Hong Kong, warned investors there to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong citizens who don't know much about the stock market
should not make any investments at this chaotic time,'' Tung said
on Monday, according to Hong Kong press reports. ``We welcome all
kinds of people to invest in Hong Kong and will not bar hedge
funds.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, the market has taken such a beating recently that
since mid-August, the authorities have spent $12.5 billion in the
stock and futures markets to prop up plummeting prices. Authorities
also may devise limits to squash bets against shares.

INDONESIA'S ECONOMY REBOUNDING FASTER THAN EXPECTED, MINISTER
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ At a time when investors seem ready to hang
black crepe over the global economy, Indonesia's Finance Minister
is guardedly optimistic about one of the world's bleakest
economies.
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the coordinating minister for economy,
finance, and industry, said Tuesday that Indonesia's currency, the
rupiah, had strengthened more quickly than he expected. Barring any
fresh calamities, he also said Indonesia's economy could show a
positive growth rate in two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar, 57, who served under President Suharto and was kept
on by Suharto's successor, B.J. Habibie, said the government had
moved swiftly to rebuild the shattered economy by taking over
insolvent banks and negotiating a deal to revamp crushing corporate
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you compare us to other governments _ Yeltsin, China,
whomever _ we are moving more rapidly than many others,'' said
Ginandjar, a suave bureaucrat who has parlayed his ties to the
global financial community into a powerful position in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar's main cause for optimism is the rebound in the
rupiah, which has risen by 28 percent in the last two months, after
all but collapsing when the country was convulsed by riots and
political turmoil in May.
</P>
<P>
   If the rupiah continues to rise at this rate, Ginandjar said the
government would surpass its goal of getting the exchange rate to
10,000 rupiah to the dollar by the end of the year. After falling
as low as 17,000 to the dollar last winter, the rupiah was trading
at 10,700 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A stronger rupiah would be a tonic for the economy, Ginandjar
said. It would ease the burden of Indonesia's $140 billion in
public and private debt and allow the government to cut widespread
subsidies on food, fuel and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar acknowledged that Indonesia still faced profound
economic problems. Inflation is running at an annual rate of 80
percent; one-fifth of Indonesia's 92 million workers are
unemployed, and economists project that the country's output will
contract by 15 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, a new report by the International Labor Organization
projects that 75 million people, or 37 percent of Indonesia's
population, will fall below the poverty line by the end of this
year. That could rise to 100 million by 1999 _ the highest poverty
levels since the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not normal times,'' Ginandjar said. Referring to the
riots that left 1,200 people dead, Jakarta in flames and the
economy in ruins, he said, ``What happened in May will have a
long-lasting effect on Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ginandjar said, Indonesia was abiding by the terms of its
latest agreement with the International Monetary Fund. The
government recently took over the nation's largest private bank,
Bank Central Asia, and announced plans to shut down three other
banks and merge four state-owned ones.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia has also restructured its $80 billion in private debt
with foreign lenders, rather than threatening to impose a debt
moratorium or telling creditors that they would have to suffer a
loss, as Russia recently did.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, Indonesia is looking better because other
countries have begun to look worse. In addition to Russia's rebuff
of foreign lenders, Malaysia announced Tuesday that it would impose
sweeping capital and exchange controls to stem the decline of its
currency, the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong, a bastion of free-market economics in Asia, the
government has intervened aggressively to prop up its flagging
stock market. Even the United States, which escaped the effects of
the Asian flu for more than a year, has come down with a worrying
case of the sniffles.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Ginandjar said, a slowdown in the United
States would actually benefit Indonesia, since it would stem the
flow of capital from Asia across the Pacific. If that capital
outflow were slowed or even reversed, the rupiah could be further
buoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Although a slowdown in the United States would hobble
Indonesia's exports, Ginandjar said those exports were already so
depressed that a further decline would barely affect the country's
growth rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that a U.S. recession would benefit
Indonesia,'' he added. ``But I'm saying that there would be some
short-term benefits out of it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that Russia should take a page out of
Indonesia's playbook. The two countries are similar in that both
have suffered a triple hit from collapsing currencies, suffocating
debt and political crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Wood, a regional strategist at Santander Investment
Securities in Hong Kong, observed that Indonesia's recovery began
only after President Suharto resigned. For Russia to climb out of
its current predicament, Wood said, President Boris Yeltsin will
have to step aside, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ginandjar, who has been said by people here to harbor
presidential ambitions of his own, was reluctant to comment on
Russia's woes. ``I'm not a good teacher,'' he said with a wry
smile. ``We have made so many mistakes that I would not want to put
us in the position of telling other countries what to do.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   RASHARKIN, Northern Ireland _ The nightmare never ends. Every
horrific bombing underscores a centuries-old religious division
that political will has yet to mend.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinn family knows the violence all too well. In July,
Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, three young sons, died in the first
major terrorist attack since the Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, their mother, Chrissie Quinn, spoke for the
first time about her grief _ a family's dreams shattered, a
country's future in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when she fears the grief will drive her insane,
Chrissie Quinn tells herself she's just having a nightmare and that
when she wakes up, all her boys will be alive, laughing and
inseparable, as they always were.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact three of her four boys are lying, inseparable
forever, side by side by side, in their graves. Only her eldest,
Lee, 13, is with her.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brothers _ chatty Richard, 11, gentle Mark, 10, and
wee Jason, the warrior who turned nine just four days before they
died _ were murdered in an evil and cowardly way by someone who
used the name of God as a pitiful excuse for hatred. The family was
targeted while they slept; the terrorist tossed at least one,
perhaps more, firebombs into their home July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, on merciful days, Chrissie is just numb. She's beyond
tears. Months later, the reality hasn't really sunk in.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The winding road to Rasharkin, a town about 35 miles northwest
of Belfast, is quite beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Quinn is staying in this mostly Catholic small town
with her mother. Along the way, sheep graze peacefully in gently
rolling hills people proudly describe as ``40 shades of green.''
Church bells seem to be always ringing. Weaving through villages,
one can see children playing in quiet streets with tidy flower
beds. The serenity is so deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Union Jacks mark areas where Protestants live. None fly in
pockets where Catholics dwell. The area suffers the undercurrent of
hatred that sweeps throughout Northern Ireland pitting Catholic
against Protestants, loyalists against those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   There's always tension between the Catholic minority that pushes
for a united Ireland, free of British rule, and the 60 percent
pro-British Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   What the religious hatred can do, and has done _ bombings,
shootings and beatings, all especially brutal over the past 30
years _ makes parents overly protective of their children.
</P>
<P>
   And then the death of the Quinn boys in the early morning hours
of July 12 shocked the world and brought it to disbelieving tears.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in the predominantly Protestant town of Ballymoney,
about five miles from Rasharkin. Outrage rocked Northern Ireland, a
place quite accustomed to violence, a place where 1.6 million
people had their hopes pinned on the Good Friday peace agreement
developed last April.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was endorsed in the Irish republic and on May 22, an
overwhelming majority in Northern Ireland voted to give peace a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence would not be over that easily. Dissidents in
the Irish Republican Army oppose a cease-fire. And some, likely
dissident splinter groups, continue to let off bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballymoney is 10 km from Bendooragh, where Chrissie was born.
Ballymoney is where she had lived for 20 years _ and where all her
boys were born and went to school and played with other children,
Protestant and Catholic alike.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place she says she wants to go back to for only one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like going there to ask them why ...''
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at Chrissie's mother's home, a pretty row house in a
quiet cul-de-sac, not expecting to see her. Her uncle Harry Patton
wanted to talk but had warned that Chrissie hasn't been strong
enough to face many people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's waiting, standing in the living room like a statue,
trying to be brave. So pretty, so fragile and in so much pain. What
does one say to this tormented mother? Who can really know what
she's going through? No one, her Uncle Harry says.
</P>
<P>
   The chatter of children _ her nephews and cousins _ permeates
the small house. But three wee voices are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's wearing a new tan sweater, new pants and new shoes,
bought out of necessity because everything she owned _ including
every picture, drawing and treasure of her boys accumulated over
the years _ was destroyed in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her eldest son Lee, 13, is ``Grammy's boy.'' He slept here that
tragic night with Chrissie's mom Irene, a kind woman who brings in
tea and chocolate. She smiles, but her eyes reveal an utterly
shattered heart.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie and her boys lived in the Ballymoney house with her
sister Colette and her four-month-old daughter Shannon. Colette,
18, who was visiting friends that July night, came home at about 9
p.m. to feed Shannon. Her friends urged her to come back _ and
bring the baby with her. She did, and decided they'd both stay the
night. It was a casual decision, one that may have saved their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie let the three boys stay up late to watch TV. Jason had
nodded off to sleep. She woke him up and sent them all off to bed
at 1 p.m. ``with a tuck and a kiss,'' like she always did, not
knowing it would be the last time she'd feel the loving joy of
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Two friends were staying over _ Raymond Craig, 31, and Christina
Archibald, 18.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m. an explosion rocked the house. Someone had thrown
at least one petrol bomb in through the living room window. A
fireball roared through the house.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie, Raymond and Christina escaped though a front window.
The boys were trapped in an upper rear bedroom. Their screams
pierced the night.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors poured out of their houses. Craig tried desperately to
get to the boys. He broke a window, cutting himself, but was driven
back by heat and flames.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, young Richard cried: ``I'm in a corner.'' For some
reason he didn't, couldn't, obey pleas from those on the street
urging him to jump. One of the other boys, no one's sure which one,
screamed that his feet were burning. All efforts to get them out
were futile. By the time firemen arrived, the boys were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie can't say much about that night. She goes pale and
silent for a long time. Until now, she hasn't said much to anyone
except her younger brother Frankie, 23, a handsome young man with a
gold earring and a gentle manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie lies here on the couch to go to sleep. I won't let
him. I shake him night after night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Brother and sister talk and she chain smokes. The silence of her
eldest son Lee worries her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee hasn't talked about it yet,'' Chrissie says. ``And I don't
know what to say to him. Lee sits and daydreams. He was crying the
other morning but he wouldn't talk. Last night ... he was sitting
on his bed looking at a photo of his brothers. I lay down beside
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Who were these boys they'll always grieve for?
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie smiles for the first time when asked to talk about the
boys she devoted her life to. ``All I did was be a mum,'' Chrissie
says, having largely raised them herself.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, whom she divorced, went off to England a long time
ago. Chrissie and their stepfather split up almost a year ago.
``It's the memory of my boys that keeps me sane _ I have to keep
strong for Lee. Every pregnancy was easy. The longest I was in
labor was three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard liked to be independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard, he was the most outgoing _ hyperactive. His chatter
never stopped. He never stopped running around, playing. I don't
have a picture of the boys together. I could never get Richard to
sit long enough with the other boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a dark look crosses Chrissie's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard had his shoes packed for high school. He was ready to
go. He was going to be in Grade 8. I'm dreading his birthday,'' she
says. It's not until Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The living room door opens. Uncle Harry and a boy with rosy,
chubby cheeks walk in. It's Lee, a shy, teddy bear of a boy who
steals one's heart in a second.
</P>
<P>
   He silently sits on the couch _ as close as he can to his mum.
The boy looks confused. He listens to Chrissie talk about Mark, the
quiet one who had his mind set on being a policeman and had an
insatiable appetite for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to read anything, everything. He'd get off the school
bus with a book open. I like to read as well. We read together. He
used to bring me love stories from the library.'' Another smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark would walk in the house and say 'Mummy, I brought one for
you.' Mark would get teased by other children because he was so
clingy to me.'' His little brother Jason felt obliged to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason stuck up for Mark all the time. He had no fear. His
fists flew if they had to. He was a loner, but Jason was starting
to come out of his shell. Jason was excellent at TV games.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were always together. They'd spend most nights

<P>
   ``They were just being boys growing up with their mom,'' she
says. ``My boys were the best boys. They were mine. They didn't
deserve what happened to them. They deserved to grow up. The people
who did this got to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger is starting to seep into her numbness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am starting to feel angry. That's why I couldn't sleep last
night. And I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland has long been tormented with sectarian
killings. No one needs much of an excuse, a simple anniversary will
do. Things particularly get tense when July 12 approaches, the
anniversary of the 1690 battle when the Catholic army was defeated
by England's Protestant king. Catholics don't want Protestants
parading in their areas. Protestants say it's their right. Conflict
goes hand in hand with demonstrations and parades. And so do
sinister threats.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 300 Protestant and about 25 Catholic homes in
Ballymoney. On the morning of July 11, Catholic families received
letters warning them to ``get out'' from a paramilitary group
identifying itself as the Ulster Volunteer Force. Some of the
envelopes had bullets in them. Many families left to live with
relatives elsewhere _ and are still staying away from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's mom had recently moved to Rasharkin because it was
coming up to the 12th. On the 10th, two petrol bombs were hurled
into the house she left. It was empty so they just burned
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get a letter. I thought I must be excepted,''
Chrissie says.
</P>
<P>
   There had been trouble in the past, but she thought it was over.
``Three years ago around July 12, my husband and my brother fought
with people in the square. It started because my childrens' tennis
ball went into the neighbor's yard.'' The neighbors were
Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, in a different home in Ballymoney, her second
husband John Dillon, a Catholic, was shot. ``It took his thigh
away,'' Chrissie says. Shortly after, about 15 members of the UVF
came by ``to smash chairs through my windows.'' She asked the
housing executive to move her to another house. They said no.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after that police visited and said they'd received a
``coded message'' warning that John's life was in danger. The
family fled to England. After six months Chrissie was homesick. She
and the boys returned. All was calm. Her four boys played football
with other children and went to the Protestant school. And now
there is only one.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie clings to a vow made by police, who Uncle Harry says
``haven't slept _ the whole team hasn't slept.'' ``They promised me
they'll never close this case until they get all of them. I know
there's more than one,'' Chrissie says. ``I want them all caught,''
she says flatly.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the tragedy, the outpouring of grief from
around the world has stunned Chrissie Quinn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes you realize there's only a small percentage of
people who are evil,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of letters continue to arrive. Chrissie says some are
written in foreign languages _German, Japanese. It doesn't matter
to her. She knows that whatever the contents are, whoever sent them
meant well. Others offer words of sympathy. And still others
personal stories of their own tragic losses.
</P>
<P>
   Three innocent boys.
</P>
<P>
   Three lives lost in a horrible way.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? One confused brother and one devastated mother who
face spending the rest of their lives without them, trying to make
sense out of why.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the outrage and outpouring of grief, Chrissie
believes, their brutal murders won't help the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, Ireland won't get better. It won't change,'' Chrissie
sighs.

<P>
   RASHARKIN, Northern Ireland _ The nightmare never ends. Every
horrific bombing underscores a centuries-old religious division
that political will has yet to mend.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinn family knows the violence all too well. In July,
Richard, Mark and Jason Quinn, three young sons, died in the first
major terrorist attack since the Good Friday peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   In this interview, their mother, Chrissie Quinn, spoke for the
first time about her grief _ a family's dreams shattered, a
country's future in shambles.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, when she fears the grief will drive her insane,
Chrissie Quinn tells herself she's just having a nightmare and that
when she wakes up, all her boys will be alive, laughing and
inseparable, as they always were.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact three of her four boys are lying, inseparable
forever, side by side by side, in their graves. Only her eldest,
Lee, 13, is with her.
</P>
<P>
   The younger brothers _ chatty Richard, 11, gentle Mark, 10, and
wee Jason, the warrior who turned nine just four days before they
died _ were murdered in an evil and cowardly way by someone who
used the name of God as a pitiful excuse for hatred. The family was
targeted while they slept; the terrorist tossed at least one,
perhaps more, firebombs into their home July 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, on merciful days, Chrissie is just numb. She's beyond
tears. Months later, the reality hasn't really sunk in.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The winding road to Rasharkin, a town about 35 miles northwest
of Belfast, is quite beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie Quinn is staying in this mostly Catholic small town
with her mother. Along the way, sheep graze peacefully in gently
rolling hills people proudly describe as ``40 shades of green.''
Church bells seem to be always ringing. Weaving through villages,
one can see children playing in quiet streets with tidy flower
beds. The serenity is so deceiving.
</P>
<P>
   Union Jacks mark areas where Protestants live. None fly in
pockets where Catholics dwell. The area suffers the undercurrent of
hatred that sweeps throughout Northern Ireland pitting Catholic
against Protestants, loyalists against those who aren't.
</P>
<P>
   There's always tension between the Catholic minority that pushes
for a united Ireland, free of British rule, and the 60 percent
pro-British Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   What the religious hatred can do, and has done _ bombings,
shootings and beatings, all especially brutal over the past 30
years _ makes parents overly protective of their children.
</P>
<P>
   And then the death of the Quinn boys in the early morning hours
of July 12 shocked the world and brought it to disbelieving tears.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in the predominantly Protestant town of Ballymoney,
about five miles from Rasharkin. Outrage rocked Northern Ireland, a
place quite accustomed to violence, a place where 1.6 million
people had their hopes pinned on the Good Friday peace agreement
developed last April.
</P>
<P>
   The pact was endorsed in the Irish republic and on May 22, an
overwhelming majority in Northern Ireland voted to give peace a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence would not be over that easily. Dissidents in
the Irish Republican Army oppose a cease-fire. And some, likely
dissident splinter groups, continue to let off bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Ballymoney is 10 km from Bendooragh, where Chrissie was born.
Ballymoney is where she had lived for 20 years _ and where all her
boys were born and went to school and played with other children,
Protestant and Catholic alike.
</P>
<P>
   It's a place she says she wants to go back to for only one
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like going there to ask them why ...''
</P>
<P>
   I arrived at Chrissie's mother's home, a pretty row house in a
quiet cul-de-sac, not expecting to see her. Her uncle Harry Patton
wanted to talk but had warned that Chrissie hasn't been strong
enough to face many people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she's waiting, standing in the living room like a statue,
trying to be brave. So pretty, so fragile and in so much pain. What
does one say to this tormented mother? Who can really know what
she's going through? No one, her Uncle Harry says.
</P>
<P>
   The chatter of children _ her nephews and cousins _ permeates
the small house. But three wee voices are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie's wearing a new tan sweater, new pants and new shoes,
bought out of necessity because everything she owned _ including
every picture, drawing and treasure of her boys accumulated over
the years _ was destroyed in the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Her eldest son Lee, 13, is ``Grammy's boy.'' He slept here that
tragic night with Chrissie's mom Irene, a kind woman who brings in
tea and chocolate. She smiles, but her eyes reveal an utterly
shattered heart.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie and her boys lived in the Ballymoney house with her
sister Colette and her four-month-old daughter Shannon. Colette,
18, who was visiting friends that July night, came home at about 9
p.m. to feed Shannon. Her friends urged her to come back _ and
bring the baby with her. She did, and decided they'd both stay the
night. It was a casual decision, one that may have saved their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie let the three boys stay up late to watch TV. Jason had
nodded off to sleep. She woke him up and sent them all off to bed
at 1 p.m. ``with a tuck and a kiss,'' like she always did, not
knowing it would be the last time she'd feel the loving joy of
doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Two friends were staying over _ Raymond Craig, 31, and Christina
Archibald, 18.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 a.m. an explosion rocked the house. Someone had thrown
at least one petrol bomb in through the living room window. A
fireball roared through the house.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie, Raymond and Christina escaped though a front window.
The boys were trapped in an upper rear bedroom. Their screams
pierced the night.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors poured out of their houses. Craig tried desperately to
get to the boys. He broke a window, cutting himself, but was driven
back by heat and flames.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, young Richard cried: ``I'm in a corner.'' For some
reason he didn't, couldn't, obey pleas from those on the street
urging him to jump. One of the other boys, no one's sure which one,
screamed that his feet were burning. All efforts to get them out
were futile. By the time firemen arrived, the boys were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie can't say much about that night. She goes pale and
silent for a long time. Until now, she hasn't said much to anyone
except her younger brother Frankie, 23, a handsome young man with a
gold earring and a gentle manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankie lies here on the couch to go to sleep. I won't let
him. I shake him night after night,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Brother and sister talk and she chain smokes. The silence of her
eldest son Lee worries her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee hasn't talked about it yet,'' Chrissie says. ``And I don't
know what to say to him. Lee sits and daydreams. He was crying the
other morning but he wouldn't talk. Last night ... he was sitting
on his bed looking at a photo of his brothers. I lay down beside
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Who were these boys they'll always grieve for?
</P>
<P>
   Chrissie smiles for the first time when asked to talk about the
boys she devoted her life to. ``All I did was be a mum,'' Chrissie
says, having largely raised them herself.
</P>
<P>
   Their father, whom she divorced, went off to England a long time
ago. Chrissie and their stepfather split up almost a year ago.
``It's the memory of my boys that keeps me sane _ I have to keep
strong for Lee. Every pregnancy was easy. The longest I was in
labor was three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard liked to be independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard, he was the most outgoing _ hyperactive. His chatter
never stopped. He never stopped running around, playing. I don't
have a picture of the boys together. I could never get Richard to
sit long enough with the other boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a dark look crosses Chrissie's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard had his shoes packed for high school. He was ready to
go. He was going to be in Grade 8. I'm dreading his birthday,'' she
says. It's not until Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The living room door opens. Uncle Harry and a boy with rosy,
chubby cheeks walk in. It's Lee, a shy, teddy bear of a boy who
steals one's heart in a second.
</P>
<P>
   He silently sits on the couch _ as close as he can to his mum.
The boy looks confused. He listens to Chrissie talk about Mark, the
quiet one who had his mind set on being a policeman and had an
insatiable appetite for books.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved to read anything, everything. He'd get off the school
bus with a book open. I like to read as well. We read together. He
used to bring me love stories from the library.'' Another smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark would walk in the house and say 'Mummy, I brought one for
you.' Mark would get teased by other children because he was so
clingy to me.'' His little brother Jason felt obliged to protect
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason stuck up for Mark all the time. He had no fear. His
fists flew if they had to. He was a loner, but Jason was starting
to come out of his shell. Jason was excellent at TV games.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were always together. They'd spend most nights
playing cards and TV games and drinking tea Mummy made.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just being boys growing up with their mom,'' she
says. ``My boys were the best boys. They were mine. They didn't
deserve what happened to them. They deserved to grow up. The people
who did this got to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger is starting to seep into her numbness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am starting to feel angry. That's why I couldn't sleep last
night. And I'm scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Ireland has long been tormented with sectarian
killings. No one needs much of an excuse, a simple anniversary will

</P>
<P>
   There are about 300 Protestant and about 25 Catholic homes in
Ballymoney. On the morning of July 11, Catholic families received
letters warning them to ``get out'' from a paramilitary group
identifying itself as the Ulster Volunteer Force. Some of the
envelopes had bullets in them. Many families left to live with
relatives elsewhere _ and are still staying away from their homes.

RIZZOTTI SINGS 3-YEAR EXTENSION WITH BLIZZARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ You could almost hear the sighs of relief from American
Basketball League officals Tuesday when the ABL announced that
Jennifer Rizzotti has signed a three-year extension to stay with
the New England Blizzard.
</P>
<P>
   The news came just a day after Dawn Staley, one of the founders
of the ABL, announced that she was jumping to the rival WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be resilient in this business, and you win some
and lose some,'' said Gary Cavalli, the co-founder and CEO of the
ABL. ``And we've won more than we've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the league signed 52 of its 54 free agents after the
first year, and has now inked 29 of 31. In addition to the loss of
Staley, Shelly Sandie opted to go back to her native Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti, a 5-foot-5-inch point guard and a two-time
All-American at the University of Connecticut, signed with the
Blizzard, who are based in Hartford, after graduating.
</P>
<P>
   A New England cocaptain, she was named to the All-Star team the
past two seasons. Last year, she averaged 10.8 points and a
team-high 4.4 assists as the team posted a 24-20 record and went to
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rizzotti, 24, said Tuesdayshe felt ``very relieved'' that the
decision-making process was finally over, and acknowledged that she
was being courted by both leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WNBA made it clear right away that they were interested,''
she said, ``and I went down to New York to their offices to talk to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision came down to a variety of factors, including
location (she lives 10 minutes from Hartford), duration of the
season (``I like having summers off to go to the beach and play
golf''), and salary (``it's a very good thing'').
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end, the whole thing weighed in the ABL's favor,'' said
Rizzotti.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great state here for basketball. The fan base we
have created with the Blizzard is very similar to what we had at
UConn. People are very supportive and enthusiastic about the
game.''

<P>
   At best, Northern Ireland was stuttering and grumbling its way
toward a highly uncertain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although it withstood one severe challenge this summer _ by a
very Irish kind of luck _ the Omagh bombing is a threat even more
tragic and perilous.
</P>
<P>
   April's Good Friday agreement, whose signing in Belfast was
celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic, did no more than sketch
out a middle ground on which unionists and nationalists who reject
violence might together govern this province of 1.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But that ground is narrow, and painful issues still must be
faced this year, while already, the renewed terrorism has all but
swamped the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues go to the heart of the relationship
between Protestants and Catholics, who roughly equate with
unionists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The initial referendum on the peace accord gained the support of
71 percent of the province's voters. Most of the no votes were in
the unionist camp, which makes up between 55 percent and 60 percent
of the province. The unionists have many cavils with the agreement
and the structure of the assembly it sets up.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all they are concerned and often enraged by the vast
concessions being made to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has waged continuous war on the United Kingdom and on
unionists for 30 years; many unionists cannot believe _ especially
now after Omagh _ that the IRA has given up and see in any
acquiescence to the agreement a sly opening gambit in a war by
other means.
</P>
<P>
   The two toughest elements for the unionists to swallow are the
release of terrorists, the majority of whom are republicans, and
the entry into the provincial government of leading members of Sinn
Fein, such as Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   According to the cunningly wrought agreement _ which gives and
takes in roughly equal measure _ Northern Ireland is confirmed as
part of the United Kingdom. But there must be a development of the
cross-border institutions that unionists fear because nationalists
see them as embryos of an all-Irish government.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic fear may be well-founded: that the nationalists in
Northern Ireland will use the newly created assembly to advance a
nationalist and sectarian-Catholic agenda, rather than using it to
govern a divided province within the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in other parts of the world, recent settlements and
negotiations have included some form of renunciation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, South African whites renounced their right to rule.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, at least in negotiations,
recognized Israel's right to exist. Mikhail Gorbachev let communism
die.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, on the other hand, has agreed to take part in the
parliament of a province whose right to exist as part of the United
Kingdom it does not recognize. The IRA has neither formally nor
informally renounced its absolute opposition to British rule in any
part of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Even the nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP),
which has always argued for peaceful politics, continues to press
for a united Ireland _ especially in the statements and speeches of
its leader, John Hume.
</P>
<P>
   It is, then, no mystery why unionists do not all gladly embrace
peace. They see the enemy against which they have fought for three
decades brought inside the pale of democratic politics and rewarded
with seats, ministerial posts and salaries _ without changing
position, apologizing for past murders or giving up any of its
large stock of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The largest uncertainty in the unionist mind is Irish
nationalism. For all of this century, Irish nationalism has been
variegated and has spoken with different accents, but in the end
saw itself as a family that, when challenged, would always put
unity before agreement with opponents.
</P>
<P>
   In this version, no nationalist, no matter how reasonable,
peacefully inclined or constitutionally minded, would betray the
cause of a united Ireland, even if he might tut-tut at the methods
used by the IRA. The British were never a friendly neighboring
state or fellow member of the European Union. Where not the enemy
(as they were to the IRA), they were at least an obstacle to the
historic mission to unify.
</P>
<P>
   Both the SDLP and Sinn Fein sold the agreement to their
followers on the understanding that it would lead to a united
Ireland sooner or later. Gerry Adams won assent from his doubting
organization by persuading it that peaceful means could advance the
republican agenda better than war.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the IRA has not handed in any weapons and has
consistently refused to countenance doing so. Weapons surrender has
been the great failure of the talks. They were supposed to be
surrendered before the talks began, while they were taking place,
and before Sinn Fein takes the seats it won in the June assembly
elections and before Adams gets the ministerial position to which
Sinn Fein's vote entitles him. The lack of any progress on this
front fuels unionist fears.
</P>
<P>
   The only issue that aggravates the unionists even more than
weapons is the release of terrorist prisoners. Although both
republican and loyalist terrorists are to be released, the former
greatly outnumber the latter, and their release causes much more
outrage in unionist areas than loyalist releases do in nationalist
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the men to be released killed policemen; others gunned
down part-time members of the army reserve. Some were enforcers
within the nationalist community, where punishment for crimes such
as drug dealing is a bullet through one or both kneecaps, or for
suspected betrayal, death. Their release causes revulsion,
especially among members of the police force (the Royal Ulster
Constabulary) and former members of the army reserve.
</P>
<P>
   There is also fear as Sinn Fein continues to strive to overtake
the SDLP as the largest nationalist party by stressing the
discrimination and exclusion many Catholics still say they feel.
</P>
<P>
   The rarely voiced but always present factor in Northern
Ireland's politics is the ticking clock of demographics. Catholics
were little more than 30 percent of the population in the 1920s, at
the time of partition; they now account for well over 40 percent
and are still growing relative to the Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   While a significant minority of Catholics probably vote for a
unionist party, the overwhelming majority votes nationalist and can
be expected to continue to do so. When the number of Catholics
approaches a majority, Protestants who cannot bear the thought of
becoming part of a united Ireland may turn to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among unionists, loyalty to God, conscience, or both is more
highly esteemed than loyalty to a party leader. Further, the
messianism of republicanism is countered by a view that Ulster's
status as part of the United Kingdom is quasi-religious and
includes for many unionists a passionately felt loyalty to a
monarchy which remains Protestant (no Catholic can succeed to the
throne of Great Britain).
</P>
<P>
   These issues are large _ and the mood is delicate, especially in
the unionist camp. Indeed, the strains of mistrust and violence may
sink the peace process and produce a situation as dangerous as any
of the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But it cannot be denied that, thus far, the changes are vast,
and the situation is more hopeful than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Bombs used to go off nightly; the cities of Belfast,
Londonderry, and most towns and villages were saturated by police
and army troops, with endless roadblocks, body searches and random
questioning by patrols. The British and Irish governments were
coldly formal with each other; the old provincial parliament was
abolished and direct rule put in its place; much of the Catholic
working class was slipping toward the IRA, and Protestant
paramilitary groups were massing across the province.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though Belfast is not a showcase among British cities, it
has recovered something of its tranquillity and lost some of its
grimy, slummy industrial look _ rather like Glasgow, which it
resembles and whose industrial development was similar to its own.
</P>
<P>
   So much public money has been pumped into the province that its
infrastructure is better than most other parts of the United
Kingdom. The two great engineering plants in Belfast _ the
shipbuilders Harland and Wolff and the Shorts aircraft
manufacturers _ have been kept in existence through adroit placing
of state contracts. An erstwhile culinary desert and possessor of
thousands of smoky, men-only bars divided on sectarian lines now
has a rash of bistros, trendy restaurants, and comfortable hotels.
</P>
<P>
   A moderate nationalist has become mayor of Belfast, reflecting
both unionist division and a growing Catholic inner-city
population, and has won cautious assent from the moderate
unionists. The second main city, Londonderry, has been
nationalist-controlled for years. Apart from some flashpoints
around marching season, trouble has been relatively low.
</P>
<P>
   In all this visible improvement, ``relatively'' is the key word.
In all but the most solidly Protestant enclaves, which have been
largely untouched by the troubles, both communities are
distrustful, sometimes vengeful, with collective memories of
grievance that will last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Time is needed in which the main political figures have _ or
should have _ some space in which to create, rather than merely
preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the 21st century, peace is a tall order, but the
agreement still gives hope it might be done, at last.

<P>
   At best, Northern Ireland was stuttering and grumbling its way
toward a highly uncertain peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although it withstood one severe challenge this summer _ by a
very Irish kind of luck _ the Omagh bombing is a threat even more
tragic and perilous.
</P>
<P>
   April's Good Friday agreement, whose signing in Belfast was
celebrated on both sides of the Atlantic, did no more than sketch
out a middle ground on which unionists and nationalists who reject
violence might together govern this province of 1.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   But that ground is narrow, and painful issues still must be
faced this year, while already, the renewed terrorism has all but
swamped the accord.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved issues go to the heart of the relationship
between Protestants and Catholics, who roughly equate with
unionists and nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   The initial referendum on the peace accord gained the support of
71 percent of the province's voters. Most of the no votes were in
the unionist camp, which makes up between 55 percent and 60 percent
of the province. The unionists have many cavils with the agreement
and the structure of the assembly it sets up.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all they are concerned and often enraged by the vast
concessions being made to Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has waged continuous war on the United Kingdom and on
unionists for 30 years; many unionists cannot believe _ especially
now after Omagh _ that the IRA has given up and see in any
acquiescence to the agreement a sly opening gambit in a war by
other means.
</P>
<P>
   The two toughest elements for the unionists to swallow are the
release of terrorists, the majority of whom are republicans, and
the entry into the provincial government of leading members of Sinn
Fein, such as Gerry Adams.
</P>
<P>
   According to the cunningly wrought agreement _ which gives and
takes in roughly equal measure _ Northern Ireland is confirmed as
part of the United Kingdom. But there must be a development of the
cross-border institutions that unionists fear because nationalists
see them as embryos of an all-Irish government.
</P>
<P>
   Their basic fear may be well-founded: that the nationalists in
Northern Ireland will use the newly created assembly to advance a
nationalist and sectarian-Catholic agenda, rather than using it to
govern a divided province within the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, in other parts of the world, recent settlements and
negotiations have included some form of renunciation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, South African whites renounced their right to rule.
The Palestine Liberation Organization, at least in negotiations,

die.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA, on the other hand, has agreed to take part in the
parliament of a province whose right to exist as part of the United

REVOLUTION TAKE PLAYOFF QUEST TO DOOR OF METROSTARS

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass._ The MetroStars have been Major League
Soccer's toughest team on coaches. They went through three, all
with international credentials, before finding success this year
with Alfonso Mondelo.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars have clinched a playoff spot in the Eastern
Conference by emphasizing resourcefulness over aesthetics. They
will be playing the rest of the season, starting Wednesday night
against the Revolution, for home-field advantage in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is an ambivalence about the perceived advantage of the
home field for the MetroStars, since they must perform for the rest
of the regular season on artificial turf at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   So the Revolution could have an advantage, since they remain in
playoff contention and the players are attempting to impress new
coach Walter Zenga.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga, the Revolution's third coach in three seasons, has not
surrendered this year, but he seems more concerned with preparing
for next season, since the Revolution trail Miami by 9 points with
five matches remaining for the final playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mathematically, we are still in it,'' Zenga said Tuesday.
``But we are looking to next year while playing these five games.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga worked on defensive positioning during training before the
team boarded a bus for New Jersey Tuesday afternoon. He stopped the
practice several times to advise players, often telling them to
remain mentally sharp and warning them of complacency.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy is for the team to play good soccer, to stay
compact, believe in the team, and don't lose trust in themselves,''
Zenga said. ``And yes, they should try to win, because that is what
their lives are about. I am working to transfer my mentality to
them for next year, to emphasize their responsibility to the fans
and to the ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   After the first two MLS seasons, the MetroStars and Revolution
were even with 20 regulation-time victories each.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars then lost former World Cup-winning coach Carlos
Alberto Parreira to Saudi Arabia. They hired Mondelo, who had been
coaching the Long Island Roughriders, and added defender Alexi
Lalas from the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Former Revolution coach Thomas Rongen revamped New England but
produced the worst record in the league, one that was on a pace for
the worst mark of any team in the league's first three seasons. The
Revolution have 20 points in 27 matches this season and a total of
91 points in 93 regular-season and playoff matches overall.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go onto the field with a certain mentality, but the
opponent has its mentality, too,'' Zenga said. ``Everyone wants to
see our team always play with a good personality, to be positive,
trust themselves, help each other out. That is the dream for
everyone. But if you solve one problem, another problem can come
out. Soccer is strange because you never know what will happen
next.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Think Joan Crawford at her ``Mommie Dearest''
worst. Now, think of all that twisted fury unleashed in a whirl of
kick boxing, sword-wielding and bone-crushing mayhem, and you get
an idea what today's TV female action heroines are like. In the
'60s we had ``The Avengers'' with Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) and
``Honey West'' (starring Anne Francis in the title role), but their
karate moves look positively dainty compared to the likes of
today's TV terminators _ Xena, Warrior Princess (Lucy Lawless) and
Buffy the Vampire Slayer (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Now, some fans
prefer watching ``Buffy,'' which returns with new episodes at 8
p.m. Sept. 29 on KTLA (Channel 5), with its teen-age star and her
scorched-demon policy, while others favor ``Xena,'' which begins
its new season at 9 p.m. Oct. 3, also on KTLA, with it
slice-and-dice queen (we mean princess).
</P>
<P>
   To settle the debate (peaceably) over which show is the baddest
(like in good), we had our panel of experts (well, more like
fanatics) dissect the strengths of each series:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST MAKEUP EFFECTS
</P>
<P>
   (Featuring the creatures)
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
</P>
<P>
   No, we're not taking about Gellar's eyeliner (it can be
frightening), but some impressive creature makeup effects from
vampires, werewolves, giant worm demons and last, but not least,
the half-fish Sunnydale High swim team.
</P>
<P>
   The prosthetic effects for the Warrior Princess are ambitious
(centaurs and other creatures) but don't seem to come off as well
as the Slayer's show.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST ACTRESS
</P>
<P>
   (That's like asking who can smash faces better. OK, a legitimate
question but we couldn't decide.)
</P>
<P>
   Draw
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST COSTUME
</P>
<P>
   (Finally, something important)
</P>
<P>
   ``Xena, Warrior Princess''
</P>
<P>
   While colorful, Buffy's dizzying teen trash fashions are enough
to make any mother race for a Valium or any viewer wondering if
they're feeling the effects of bad sushi. The Warrior Princess wins
this one with a classic brass-brassiere-and-leather ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST LOVE INTEREST
</P>
<P>
   (Sleeping with the enemy)
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
</P>
<P>
   The Slayer's main squeeze is the vampire Angel (David Boreanaz),
who has been cursed by having his human soul returned to him. This
had the effect of making him a kinder and gentler vampire and one
tormented puppy dog. Buffy fell hard and gave up her virginity to
him (more or less discreetly off camera). Unknown to either, there
was a clause in the curse that if Angel experienced ``one moment of
true happiness,'' the curse would be lifted and his human soul
would be taken away. Well, Angel experienced that moment during his
night with the Slayer, and it turned him back to his vicious
vampire self, vowing to kill Buffy, her family and friends (talk
about being dumped the morning after!).
</P>
<P>
   Xena's love life is a little too extensive to catalog here.
However, in her own beware-of-casual-sex episode, after a one-night
stand with a young Julius Caesar, the ruler returns the next day to
order her crucified and have her legs broken! Even Xena's gal pal,
Gabrielle (Renee O'Connor), had her husband murdered by Callisto
(more about her later) after their wedding night. These women just
have to learn the B-movie golden rule: If you have sex, somebody
has to die.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST SPECIAL EFFECTS
</P>
<P>
   (Best bug-eyed monsters)
</P>
<P>
   ``Xena, Warrior Princess''
</P>
<P>
   The effects house for ``Xena,'' Flat Earth Productions, produces
some remarkable effects for a weekly syndicated TV show.
Computer-generated dragons, winged harpies and even the watery god
Poseidon regularly populate the series.
</P>
<P>
   Buffy seems only to manage an endless series of vampire
disintegration scenes, and in the dramatic season finale, in which
a door to hell is opened, the visual effect looked like an outtake
from a bad Drano commercial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST VILLIAN
</P>
<P>
   (You can't keep a bad girl down)
</P>
<P>
   ``Xena, Warrior Princess''
</P>
<P>
   Warrior Queen/Goddess Callisto (portrayed by actress Hudson
Leick in a clawing cat scream of a performance) hurtles onto the
screen like a Pakistani tactical nuke about to go critical.
Callisto, who blames Xena for the death of her family, has
dedicated her life to the destruction of the Warrior Princess and
her nearest and dearest. A brief chronology of Callisto's career:
orphaned at an early age; trained herself in the martial arts;
raised an army to commit numerous atrocities, defeated by Xena in
personal combat; imprisoned, escapes, commits more atrocities;
defeated again by the Warrior Princess; murders Gabriel's husband;
dies by drowning in quicksand (while Xena watches); comes back from
Hades; switches bodies with Xena; sent back to Hades; switches
bodies again with Xena; becomes immortal; disfigured by fire;
trapped underground; becomes a goddess; encased in molten lava;
assists in the murder of Xena's son; trapped in an alternate
dimension and killed (don't you believe it) with a poisoned,
goddess-slaying dagger in the season finale.
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mention has to go to Buffy for producing a larger
number of interesting adversaries week in and week out, with
honorable mention for Spike (James Marsters) and Drusilla (Juliet
Landau), referred to by executive producer Joss Whedon as the ``Sid
and Nancy of the vampire set.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST WRITING
</P>
<P>
   (You've got to be kidding)
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
</P>
<P>
   Surprising to anybody who hasn't seen the show, ``Buffy'' is
actually a very satiric look at the suburban high-school
experience. Producer Joss Whedon has managed to keep the
high-concept program consistently fresh and interesting, with good
characterizations and plot twists.
</P>
<P>
   The best that can be said of ``Xena'' is that it has a
no-holds-barred attitude. One episode featured an ancient Greek
remake of ``The Poseidon Adventure'' (not the god, but the Irwin
Allen disaster movie), while another was a complete musical. All of
this gives it a zany but very uneven feel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST ACTION
</P>
<P>
   (Wham, bam, don't call me ma'am)
</P>
<P>
   ``Xena, Warrior Princess''
</P>
<P>
   Although some viewers might find Xena's almost-surreal Hong Kong
style of action too silly, there's no denying they've done some
spectacular stunts. Most memorable: a seaside chariot race/battle
between Xena and Callisto (again).
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mention goes to ``Slayer,'' whose more realistic
Hollywood style of action imparts a greater air of menace.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST SUPPORTING CAST
</P>
<P>
   (Suffering sidekicks)
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
</P>
<P>
   The Slayer's show has a great secondary cast of characters:
school librarian and Buffy's mentor Rupert Giles (Anthony Stewart
Head), hapless sidekick Xander Harris (Nicholas Brendon), class
brain and Buffy's best friend Willow Rosenburg (Alyson Hannigan),
and spoiled cheerleader/Xander's love interest Cordelia Chase
(Charisma Carpenter).
</P>
<P>
   Although sidekick Gabrielle (Renee O'Conner) has a growing cult
following, Xena's supporting cast is about as helpful as an anchor
thrown to a drowning Warrior Princess.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST WEAPONS
</P>
<P>
   (A cut above....)
</P>
<P>
   ``Xena, Warrior Princess''
</P>
<P>
   The Warrior Princess is very coolly equipped with broadsword,
dagger, chakra (a razor-sharp Frisbee), bullwhip, hidden stiletto
concealed between her breastplates and her war horse, Argo.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Buffy seems like a lamb (she doesn't even have a
driver's license) being led to the slaughter with only a cross,
holy water and a wooden stake. Occasionally she is armed with a
crossbow but almost invariably misses and then has to rely on her
martial-arts skills and some found object lying around the set to
stake out her victim.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
BEST SEASON FINALE
</P>
<P>
   (All's well that doesn't end in hell)
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''
</P>
<P>
   In a very dramatic end to this year's season, Buffy reveals her
secret identity to her mother and makes a pact with the devil by
allying herself with Spike. Buffy's former vampire lover Angel
regains his soul; however, in order to save the world, she's forced
to send him back to hell at swordpoint. Despondent, she becomes a
runaway, leaving Sunnydale.
</P>
<P>
   A lot certainly happened in ``Xena's'' finale. Callisto dies
(again), Gabrielle's demon daughter dies (again), the world is
saved (this happens pretty much every week), and Gabrielle dies
(for the first time). Unfortunately, we've seen it all before. What
the Warrior Princess really needs is a season finale in which her
entire writing staff goes off the cliff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SCORE
</P>
<P>
   ``Xena, Warrior Princess'' 5.5
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' 5.5
</P>
<P>
   Our panel (before resorting to fisticuffs and flailing around on
the floor) was unable to choose a clear winner. So we invite you,
the readers, to break the tie by writing us with your vote.

 &HT;    SENATE PANEL REVIEWS DIRECT MAIL SCAMS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``You are a guaranteed cash winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Millions of Americans have received similar
messages telling them they have won hundreds, thousands, even
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Many mistakenly believe the message. A Senate panel Tuesday was
told of numerous cases in which people thought they had won _ or
were about to win _ big bucks, if only they would send in one more
piece of mail.
</P>
<P>
   The implied message behind most of the direct-mail solicitations
is that if you buy something _ usually a magazine _ you have a
better chance of winning. The message is implied because it's
illegal to require a purchase in order to win.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the panel was told, people have been so misled
into thinking they have won _ or are finalists to win _ millions of
dollars that they fly to distant cities hoping to claim their
prize.
</P>
<P>
   One such city is Tampa, where Florida Attorney General Bob
Butterworth has made arrangements with local taxi drivers to bring
sweepstakes victims to his district office after they learn their
trip was in vain.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth told the panel that people _ such as a young mother
of two who borrowed $1,500 from her sister to fly from Baltimore _
come to Tampa because American Family Publishers, one of the three
major sweepstakes giants, uses a Tampa address to process its mail.
</P>
<P>
   Florida filed suit against American Family Publishers and their
celebrity spokesmen _ entertainers Ed McMahon and Dick Clark _ in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Butterworth received a notice from American
Family Publishers informing him that ``Attorney General ... will
definitely win the cash.'' The letter arrived on April Fools Day,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The elderly are particularly susceptible to sweepstakes scams,
Butterworth said, noting that he had been told by one mass-mail
operator that the Palm Beach-Broward counties area had morepotential elderly victims than the entire state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is considering a bill by Sen. Ben Nighthorse
Campbell, R-Colo., that would impose stiff regulations on
sweepstakes operators and tighten restrictions against mailings
that appear to be from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically prey on the hopes and fears of people, and the
situation is getting worse,'' Campbell told the Senate Governmental
Affairs panel. ``They're really skirting the edge ... of truth in
advertising laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell's bill would require sweepstakes mailings to carry a
large notice on the envelope and on the first page of the notice
that the recipient has not automatically won or been guaranteed a
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Barton, senior vice president of the 4,100-company
Direct Marketing Association, acknowledged that fraudulent mass
mailings _ including sweepstakes _ are a problem for his industry,
but he objected to Campbell's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring the industry to inform people on the outside of the
envelope that they haven't won would limit the number of people who
would actually open the envelope, Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   The direct mail industry plans to step up its educational
efforts to inform people how to spot bogus mailings. Any mailing
which requires people to send in money in order to qualify for a
sweepstakes or to receive government money is a fraud, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barton declined to respond to a series of questions from
panel members about specific cases of apparently deceptive
sweepstakes mailings.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem, is that some people have ``what we call
'inappropriate responses to the sweepstakes,'' Barton said,
referring to people who use up all their money buying magazines in
hopes of winning a sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Stanely Pruss, assistant attorney general of Michigan, called
Barton's comment ``astonishingly callous and outrageous. ...To
state that those who respond to these deceptive solicitations are
'unstable' is shameful, offensive and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said he planned to offer additional
legislation making it easier for the U.S. Postal Service to
investigate mass mailing scams and to impose civil penalties.
Currently, the penalty for mass mail fraud is $10,000, but postal
inspector Ken Hunter said the law was unclear whether that counted
each piece of mail as a separate violation.

PARENTS, EDUCATORS IN THE DARK ABOUT TEEN DRUG USE, ANTI-DRUG
ADVOCATE SAYS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Increasing drug use among middle- and high-school
students will continue unless parents, principals and teachers
recognize the pervasiveness of drugs and become more involved with
students, a leading anti-drug advocate said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we send our children to middle and high school, we are
tossing them into turbulent seas of illegal drugs, alcohol and
nicotine,'' said Joseph A. Califano Jr., chairman of The National
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University.
``Basically, a drug-free school is an oxymoron in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Califano also released a national survey in which 430 of the
1,000 middle and high-school students polled said that a
13-year-old can buy LSD, cocaine or heroin at school. Twenty-six
percent said the drugs could be purchased within one day.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, conducted by The Luntz Research Cos. between May and
July, also revealed differing perceptions among pupils,
administrators and teachers. While 78 percent of high school
students reported drug use at their schools, 82 percent of their
principals and 56 percent of their teachers said their schools are
drug free.
</P>
<P>
   The survey polled 822 principals but did not specify how many of
them were affiliated with high schools or middle schools. In
addition, Luntz Research contacted 478 high-school and 345
middle-school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starkly put, in 1990s America we have created for children at
the moment of their entry into their first teen year ... a world
where drugs, alcohol and cigarettes are widely available at school
and from classmates,'' said Califano, who served as secretary of
Health, Education and Welfare during the Carter administration.
``It is a world where parents, teachers and principals are in such
a state of denial about the risk of substance abuse these children
face that they are not providing the support these children need.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, found
that children whose parents spend time with them after school, at
meals and in places of worship report the lowest incidents of drug
use. Califano cited the finding in urging parents to ``be less
self-indulgent, more attentive to our children and more willing to
talk to them'' about drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well before American kids reach 12, they need to be instilled
with the moral values and individual strength to say no because
they are going to have plenty of opportunities and temptations to
say yes, from the moment they enter the sixth grade, if not
before,'' he said. ``That is a job government cannot, and should
not, do for America's children. That's a job for parents, older
siblings, churches and communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Back to School 1998,'' is the fourth annual survey
the center has commissioned from Luntz Research. In each of the
four years, a plurality of students between ages 12 and 17 reported
drugs as the greatest problem they face, surpassing other social
pressures. For the third straight year, the percent of students
reporting that drugs are used, sold and kept at school has risen,
to 78 percent this year from 72 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's children have been crying out for help and not
enough people are listening,'' said Califano, who also served as
President Lyndon Johnson's chief assistant for domestic affairs.
``Parents, teachers and principals should not fear failure. What
they should fear above all is the judgment of God and history if
we, the most affluent people on earth, do not make the time and
commitment to give our children the moral and social strength to
cope with the world of illegal drugs, cigarettes and alcohol into
which we thrust them as they enter their first teen year.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, a teachers' organization,
and the National Association of Secondary School Principals
objected to the depiction of teachers and principals as being
unaware of drug use in their schools. However, the groups hailed
the survey for keeping the focus on the scourge of teen-age drug
use and said parents and civic leaders, in addition to teachers and
principals, must be vigilant in the fight against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only going to be solved by bringing all the people who
influence kids together,'' said Jerald Newberry, executive director
of the education association's health information network. ``Is
that going to happen as a society? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lammel, director of high school services at the principals'
group, called for a ``team approach'' involving parents, school
officials and local leaders to help stop teen-agers from using
drugs. ``This whole drug issue is part of the total community,'' he
said. &QL;

<P>
   The organization is scheduled to launch the site at 9 a.m.
Tuesday. But be prepared. What you see is likely to give you a
greater jolt than your morning java.
</P>
<P>
   You'll be able to plug in your age, education and work
experience to see exactly how significant the pay gap is between
men and women over a lifetime of work.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you're a 29-year-old college educated women
you're on average earning $34,000 a year. Your male counterpart
with the same stats earns $44,350 annually.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds bad enough when you see a $10,000 difference in pay.
It's even worse when you realize that the wage gap will add up to
$990,000 over your lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to buy 43,212 restaurant meals, which would let
you eat every meal out for 39 years. Maybe you'd rather spend that
money enjoying 14 years vacationing at the beach in Jamaica? Closer
to home, that money would provide 2,475 youngsters with school
clothes and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women know there's a wage gap, but I don't think they
know how much it adds up,'' said Naomi Walker, a spokeswoman for
the AFL-CIO in Washington. ``We're hoping this (Web site) will help
push this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO decided to launch the site in response to its 1997
``Ask a Working Woman Survey'' in which more than 94 percent of the
women said that equal pay is their top concern. The majority _ 82
percent of women and 70 percent of men _ said employers pay women
less than men for the same work even though equal pay has been the
law since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems is that women often work in fields that pay
less even if the work requires more experience and education. But
the salary discrepancies don't account for the time a women may
leave the workplace to raise children because they exist even at
the beginning of someone's career, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The solutions are not easy, but the inequalities are worth
fighting. If you think you're being discriminated against, file a
complaint with the federal or state anti-discrimination agency. If
you're a union member, talk to your shop steward.
</P>
<P>
   Women need to acquire the skills that will get them jobs in
fields traditionally filled by men such as construction, high
technology and engineering, said Rose Kemp, regional administrator
for the U.S. Department of Labor's Women's Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a great time for women to negotiate for better
working conditions, that includes pay and benefits,'' Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   And she's right. Earning less not only affects our families
today, it means our pensions will be smaller tomorrow.

PROTEIN SEEMS TO PREDICT LETHAL PROSTRATE CANCERS, RESEARCHERS
SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
here have found that a protein seems to predict which prostate
cancers are likely to be deadly and warrant aggressive treatment
and which can be controlled with less treatment or perhaps none at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, published this week in The Journal of the
National Cancer Institute, also support the current understanding
that benign enlargement of the prostate, which occurs in many men
as they age, is an entirely separate development from prostate
cancer and does not lead to it.
</P>
<P>
   The studies involve a protein called p27, which other research
suggests plays an important role in controlling the growth of many
cancers that arise in lining tissues throughout the body. Studies
in Boston, Seattle, Toronto and England have linked abnormally low
levels of the p27 protein to aggressive cancers of the breast, the
colon, the lung and the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protein represents a common mechanism that helps to
control and regulate cell growth,'' explained Dr. Howard Scher, who
directs genitourinary oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. ``It
may help us predict who will be cured and who won't, and help
determine who may need additional treatment to improve the chance
of cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlos Cordon-Cardo, director of molecular pathology at
Sloan-Kettering, said p27 acted like a brake that kept cell growth
in check. When levels of this protein are low or absent, cells are
likely to proliferate rapidly. Rapid cell growth can increase the
chances of genetic mutations that may allow a cancer to develop and
grow uncontrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Cordon-Cardo explained that men with prostate cancer have a
normal gene that regulates the production of the p27 protein. But
in those with an aggressive prostate cancer that is most likely to
spread and be fatal, the tumor seems to have ``a professional
blender'' that chews up the protein. In men with less aggressive
tumors that may be curable without extensive treatment, p27 levels
are much higher, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two tumors may look alike under the microscope,'' Cordon-Cardo
said, and ``yet one patient may go on for years without the cancer
spreading, and the other may die of his cancer in two years. If we
can prognosticate at the time of diagnosis, we can determine who
should be treated more aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   In treatment of prostate cancer, the choices include radical
surgery, radiation therapy, radioactive implants, hormonal control
and chemotherapy, all of which involve varying degrees of both
short-term and long-lasting side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging understanding of p27's role in cancer grows out of
previous work by Dr. Joan Massague and Dr. Andrew Koff, molecular
biologists at Sloan-Kettering who first isolated and cloned the
protein. Koff showed that mice without the p27 gene developed
overgrowth of the prostate gland, similar to the growth that occurs
in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
</P>
<P>
   In men with this benign condition, the p27 gene is inactive, and
little or no p27 protein is produced. In men with prostate cancer,
on the other hand, the gene is active, but in some cases the tumor
has the ability to chew up the protein that the gene produces.
</P>
<P>
   The degradation of p27 protein by cancers of the colon was first
described last year by Dr. Massimo Loda of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston and Dr. Miguele Pagano of New York University.
Loda said that in colon cancer patients who initially had high
levels of the protein but whose tumors spread years later, the
protein was lost in the process of metastasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also found that p27 protein was involved in lung cancers
and breast cancers,'' Loda said.
</P>
<P>
   Scher, of Sloan-Kettering, suggested that in the future it might
be possible to identify a switch that would enable the p27 protein
to remain active and slow the growth of tumor cells.

IMAGE OF PRESIDENCY SCRUTINIZED AMID CLINTON SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It may be like trying to put the political genie
back in the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton tries to repair the damage to his
presidency, he faces a difficult time recapturing the mystique that
surrounds his office.
</P>
<P>
   And whoever follows him may not have an easy time of it, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``His actions will leave a lot of repair work for his
successor,'' said Earl Black, an expert on American politics at
Rice University. ``He has engaged in activity that cannot do
anything but damage the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that damage can be corrected, Black said, depends upon
whether Clinton's successor is someone ``who truly respects the
dignity of the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticizing the current occupant of the Oval Office, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott referred Monday to a ``moral dimension
to the American presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today that dimension, that power, has been lost in scandal and
in deception,'' Lott said. ``As a citizen, I'm disappointed in the
way the highest office in the nation has been reduced in stature
and diminished in credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The erosion of the presidency started long before Clinton.
Watergate led to congressional reforms that handcuffed the
president's war-making and budget authority. Recently, the courts
have denied the president the use of the line-item veto.
</P>
<P>
   And during Clinton's battle with independent counsel Kenneth
Starr, the courts have narrowed the circle of confidentiality that
a president traditionally took for granted. His Secret Service
protectors and close advisers can now be called to testify in court
about his activities and conversations.
</P>
<P>
   But what has taken an equally solid thrashing has been the
presidential image.
</P>
<P>
   All presidents bask in the majesty of their office, as Clinton's
state visits this week to Russia and Ireland will probably show.
They all also have a hand on awesome displays of power, as
evidenced by his recent decision to fire missiles at suspected
terrorist sites.
Mystique of the office
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystique is a kind of psychological element of the presidency
that comes and goes,'' said historian Alan Brinkley of Columbia
University. ``Whatever mystique surrounded Bill Clinton has now
disappeared. At the moment, I don't think very many people think of
presidents as mythic figures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard before lamenting of the diminishing of the
presidency and the weakening of the presidency when Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter were presidents,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then along came Reagan and everybody started writing about
the majesty of the presidency. A lot depends on personality and
circumstance. I don't think the psychological impact is necessarily
permanent.''
</P>
<P>
   That Clinton was squandering whatever presidential mystique he
had is not a new complaint. His draft status reduced him in the
eyes of some veterans. His jogging attire was fodder for late-night
talk shows. And some have never forgotten his willingness to
disclose his style of underwear.
</P>
<P>
   But with cultural values different than they were a generation
ago, it may be hard to find heroes, at least in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Historians often cite George Washington, Abraham Lincoln,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, and possibly Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow
Wilson as presidents whose deeds and thought contributed more than
others to the idea of America and the collective sense of national
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was because all of them, except Teddy Roosevelt _ who
had his ``bully pulpit'' _ dealt with a major crisis: For
Washington, it was the founding of the country; for the others, it
was war. As historical figures, they seem larger than life.
</P>
<P>
   But for a nation weaned on the notion that a president _ ``the
leader of the free world'' _ operates at some rarefied and lonely
pinnacle of power, Clinton's nationally televised speech about his
extramarital affair suddenly plummeted him to the depths of common
human experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most of us, as history teachers, have tried to put
presidents up on a pedestal, as person who always stands for
right,'' said Bill Cross, who recently retired after many years as
a history teacher in the Kansas City School District.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids at that age, those are very significant things in their
lives and they will remember this experience forever. I feel
they're going to say, `OK, if this president did it, then other
presidents are going to do the same thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There's been a lot added to the historical record in recent
years to bolster that view.
</P>
<P>
   The public now knows more about the private lives of presidents
like Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower than was
ever reported at the time they were in office. It never showed up
in history texts, either.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential scholars agreed that Clinton is being subjected to
a particularly puritanical standard and unforgiving political
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture is, without question, different,'' said Robert
Dallek, a biographer of President Lyndon Johnson. ``But this does
not excuse Clinton because he knows the standards have been changed
ever since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electronic media is now so omnipresent, you just can't
conduct yourself the way presidents did 30, 40, 50 years ago.
You've got to take into account the mores and the media and how
aggressive they've become.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallek, who teaches history at Boston University, sees the
salvaging of Clinton's presidency as a ``lost cause,'' but
believes, ``You shouldn't take from this the idea you can't have
effective leadership. In a crisis, people will want a strong
president and people will turn to him, or her.''

GROWING LIST OF COMPANIES REPORT HEAVY LOSSES FROM RUSSIAN
BUSINESS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER TRUELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ripples from Russia's economic crisis are spreading rapidly
through world financial markets, as Citicorp, Bankers Trust, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, Barclays and Nomura Securities Tuesday joined
the growing list of companies reporting heavy losses on their
Russian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp's chairman, John Reed, and its president, Victor
Menezes, said in a statement to employees that they expected
earnings for the three months ended Sept. 30 to be cut by about
$200 million because of losses related to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Citicorp, the nation's No. 2 bank, also said that its plans to
merge with the Travelers Group are ``absolutely on track'' and that
it is confident of Federal Reserve approval, which it hopes will
come before the end of September. Earlier this week, Salomon Smith
Barney, Travelers' investment banking subsidiary, said it had lost
an estimated $360 million after taxes in the past two months from
its arbitrage and Russian businesses, with $60 million of that
directly attributable to Russian-related credit losses.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, the seventh-largest American bank, said early
Tuesday that, to date, it has a $350 million pretax trading loss
for the three months ending Sept. 30 that is ``primarily
attributable to charges to reduce the carrying amount of Bankers
Trust's exposure to Russian Federation securities to 15 percent of
face value.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Aug. 31, Bankers Trust had about $350 million of Russian
loans and related assets, the company said, adding that half that
amount is financed with revenue generated in Western Europe. That
amount includes loans to companies in Russia that have parent
companies in Western Europe, and assets that are covered by
European government guarantees, said Doug Kidd, a Bankers Trust
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   At Morgan Stanley, Jon Diat, a company spokesman, read a
statement Tuesday afternoon saying that the firm ``has been
affected by the difficult conditions in global capital markets.''
As a result, ``certain credit-sensitive trading activities, and a
loss in connection with an institutional leveraged emerging markets
portfolio,'' will cause an estimated $110 million cut in net income
for the fiscal quarter just ended.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued in London, Barclays said it expected to
take a charge of 250 million pounds this year to cover potential
losses on its 340 million pounds of Russian lending and securities
trading. The big British bank also said its Barclays Capital
investment banking subsidiary has probably lost as much as 75
million pounds before taxes in the past two months because of the
Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura Securities, the largest Japanese brokerage firm, also
said Tuesday that it had lost as much as $350 million on Russian
bonds in the past year. The big Swiss banks UBS and Credit Suisse
have also disclosed hundreds of millions of Swiss francs of losses
on their Russian businesses.
</P>
<P>
   And the litany of losses isn't over yet. New York analysts said
Tuesday that they expect Chase Manhattan Bank to make a statement
about its losses on Russia, perhaps as early as Wednesday. A Chase
spokesman declined to comment on the firm's Russian business.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders, meanwhile, are trying to pressure Russia into
taking more responsibility for its financial obligations. In a
speech in Moscow Tuesday, President Clinton, in Russia for meetings
with President Boris Yeltsin and other leaders, urged the country
``to play by the rules'' and ``to treat investors fairly,'' or risk
alienating badly needed international investors.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing Bankers Trust's losses, Ronald Mandle, an analyst at
Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Company in New York, said the loss was bigger
than he had expected. ``A lot of investors looked at Russia as
being too big to fail and it turned out not to be,'' he said,
adding that ``it's extremely unusual to see a country default on
its local currency bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the bad news is out for big American banks, Mandle said,
except for one or two larger institutions _ particularly Chase.
Mandle said he had knocked his earnings estimates down a little for
both Citicorp and Chase because of the Russian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts criticized the financial services industry for
this latest round of losses. ``This all shows us that banks and
financial companies have not properly assessed the risks of their
Russian businesses,'' said John Keefe, president of Keefe
Worldwide, a New York financial services consulting firm. ``Banks
go through this type of event every few years,'' he added, citing
past problems with real estate investment trusts, Latin American
loans, commercial real estate and holdings of junk bonds. ``The
latest problem is Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, as Mandle and other analysts pointed out Tuesday,
U.S. and other big Western banks are now relatively
well-capitalized and should easily be able to absorb the kinds of
losses caused by their loans to Russia.

 &HT;    Organization is important in everyone's life, but for the
elderly it can be the key to how well they can function
independently _ and for how long. They need to simplify their
lives, while keeping their independence and dignity.
 &HT;    However, physical limitations of age or illness, poor memory,
attachment to ``the way things were'' or simply the inability to
ask for help can get in the way.
 &HT;    My mother is 87 years old and in reasonably good health, but she
is not able to do what she used to do. As she says, ``The old gray
mare, she ain't what she used to be.''
 &HT;    Her memory fails her, she can't lift things that are the least
bit heavy and she tires rather quickly. She is in a nice retirement
home, where there are services available, but the staff there
doesn't do everything.
 &HT;    That's where I come in. I am an organizer by profession, and so
I naturally began to help my mother around her home even before she
moved to the retirement home. As things in her apartment began to
be too much for her, we began to simplify her environment.
 &HT;    We went through every room, little by little, several hours at a
time. We sorted through the contents of every closet, shelf and
drawer _ clearing out unused and unwanted items, selling or
throwing away things of no use to anyone or giving usable ``stuff''
to a local charity.
 &HT;    In the kitchen, some of the pots and pans were too heavy for Mom
to lift, even empty. Things stored in very low or high cabinets, or
way in the back of other cabinets, were now impossible to reach.
Since she was no longer giving large dinner parties, many of the
kitchen and dining-room items were no longer needed, although many
held fond memories.
 &HT;    So Mom and I decided to get the family together as we went
through this part of the sorting and simplifying process. We had
many tender moments reminiscing.
 &HT;    The ``good stuff'' was left with Mom, to be fairly divided later
on. And, of course, there were special things that Mom wanted to
give to certain people, and she took care of that. Then we boxed up
dishes and other kitchen items and took them to my house, where we
could all meet and choose what we wanted to keep without putting
Mom through the strain.
 &HT;    Every family will have its own way of sorting and letting go,
but it's important to be sensitive as we try to simplify our
parents' environments to reflect their present lifestyle needs. We
want this to be a positive change, not a trauma.
 &HT;    Most elderly people want to be independent, and the order we can
help bring into their environments helps to keep them functional.
Visibility and accessibility are the watchwords in organizing for
the elderly.
 &HT;    For example, you can replace a crowded jewelry box, where things
are hard to see, by clearing a dresser drawer and putting in lined
trays with small sections for the jewelry. Then everything is
visible upon opening the dresser drawer and that long-forgotten
jewelry can be worn.
 &HT;    In reorganizing cabinets and shelves, use containers that slide
forward easily, and put the things used most often in the most
accessible spaces.
 &HT;    Even though you will be handling many tasks for your parent,
respect his or her wishes. You are the helper, so be sure to resist
the urge to take over. It can happen easily, without your realizing
it _ after all, you are used to ordering your own life _ but it can
be very damaging to your relationship with your parent and to the
success of the simplifying process.
 &HT;    Many people ask for assistance only indirectly, if at all. As
the helping child, you must be even more observant of the parent's
needs in such a case. For example, keep an eye on the parent's
medications to be sure he or she doesn't run out and forget to get
more. If you notice spots or stains on a parent's clothing, offer
to help with the wash or take things to the cleaners.
 &HT;    You might want to compose a shopping list of the items most
regularly used, and make copies of it. Then your parent can simply
check off what is needed. If the shopping is done by others, be
sure to list the particulars: brand names, sizes, where to buy.
 &HT;    All of us have difficulty dealing with the glut of paper in our
lives, and this is increasingly the case as one gets older. For
example, outdated papers and notices can be very confusing to an
elderly person. Managing finances may also become a problem.
 &HT;    In every instance, the first step is the same: Eliminate the
unnecessary.
 &HT;    If your parent doesn't have one already, start a simple portable
filing system with only the most essential papers. Be sure to label
the folders in bold capital letters that will be easy to read. Your
job may be to keep up on the filing and to make sure all the bills
are paid, checkbooks balanced and other financial matters in order.
Be sure that all the unneeded paper is disposed of regularly.
 &HT;    Most organizing tasks can be done with your parent present and
can be a wonderful opportunity to spend meaningful time together.
You can get to know and appreciate one another in new ways.
 &HT;    However, the sessions can deteriorate into constant bickering.
If your parent gets testy, it usually indicates that you have
ignored earlier signs that his or her sense of dignity and pride
has been wounded by the need to be dependent on you.
 &HT;    Keep your eyes and ears sensitive to this natural response, and
you will earn your parent's gratitude and respect. And you will
achieve your goal: to help your parent function independently and
comfortably, for as long as possible.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   You wake abruptly in the middle of the night. Something's wrong:
Your chest hurts, maybe, or you're flushed with sweat.
</P>
<P>
   You're miserable, and adding to the discomfort is your confusion
about how to respond. Should you roll over and rest easy, or should
you call the doctor? And if you need to call, should you do it now
or can you wait until morning?
</P>
<P>
   As you lie in bed, in the still, dark night, a panicky voice
inside may urge you to call an ambulance immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding what to do can be maddening, partly because p.m. pains
often do seem far worse than a.m. aches. After all, there's really
not much else going on right then except what's hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, awareness of pain and body functions is
heightened,'' says Dr. Jay Siwek, a professor and chairman of
family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center. ``The
commotion of the day is over, and you're more inclined to focus on
your symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   While some nighttime problems can be treated at home or ignored,
as you grow older these aches and pains are more likely to be
messages that you need medical attention. The following is a
roundup of late-night health complaints common among people over
50, along with doctors' expert advice on the best ways for you to
respond to trouble.
 &UR; SKIPPED HEARTBEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're lying quietly in bed when you feel your heart miss a
beat. Your pulse may start to race, or you may feel as if it pauses
for a second or two. These are symptoms of arrhythmia, a condition
increasingly common in people over 50.
</P>
<P>
   In women, irregular heart rhythms are especially likely to show
up around the time of menopause, physicians report. Hormonal
changes may be at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sense a skipped pulse but feel fine otherwise and have
no history of heart disease, generally there's no need to worry,''
says Dr. Hugh Calkins, director of arrhythmia services at Johns
Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   If you exhibit other symptoms, or if an episode is followed by a
chaotic and irregular pulse or involves chest discomfort or
light-headedness, you do need to take action.
</P>
<P>
   The most common cause of sustained rhythm disturbances is a
condition called atrial fibrillation, in which the electrical
cardiac impulse in the upper chamber of the heart become unstable,
resulting in irregular and quivering contractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``While most are not life-threatening in themselves, some
unstable heart rhythms are associated over time with an increased
risk of stroke,'' Calkins says.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: ``Most of the time missed heartbeats aren't
serious,'' says Calkins, ``but you can't always diagnose this
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   If an irregular pulse is accompanied by chest pain or faintness,
go to an emergency room right away or call your physician.
 &UR; CHEST PAIN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack is the first thing most people think of when pain
grips their chest. Yet middle-of-the-night chest pain could be
brought on by a big meal or a snack eaten just before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   When you lie flat, digestive acid may backtrack up the
esophagus. You might be able to tell the difference between
heartburn and a heart attack this way: A heart attack usually
causes bandlike pressure in the middle of the chest _ a feeling of
fullness or heaviness rather than a sharp pain. The pain may
radiate to either your arm or your jaw, and may be accompanied by
shortness of breath, sweating and/or nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Heartburn, on the other hand, is a burning sensation in the
center of the chest that radiates upward, often into the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to tell the difference: ``Take an antacid, or drink
some milk,'' says Dr. Peter Rubin, a clinical associate professor
of medicine and gastroenterology at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York City. ``If the pain goes away within a few
minutes, you've diagnosed and temporarily cured heartburn.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Head off heartburn by avoiding late-night raids on
the refrigerator. If chest pain persists or comes on with nausea,
sweating, dizziness and/or shortness of breath, it's urgent that
you call your physician, dial 911 or have someone drive you to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors advise taking an aspirin immediately to dissolve
any possible blood clot. Bring blood-pressure or other medications
with you to the hospital to help the staff assess your needs.
</P>
<P>
   And what if you simply don't feel quite right but don't want to
make a fuss? Not all heart attacks have chest pain as a main
symptom, so self-diagnosis can be tricky. It's better to go to the
hospital or call your doctor than risk misdiagnosing yourself.
 &UR; NIGHT SWEATS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You awaken in the middle of the night, drenched. Among women,
this often results from the hormonal changes of menopause. Ask your
doctor about estrogen-replacement therapy, which can help ease this
and other symptoms as your body adjusts to new hormone levels.
</P>
<P>
   Night bouts of perspiration can also be triggered by pneumonia.
A case of it involving a small percentage of the lung may not be
severe enough to keep you down-and-out during the day _ this is
what's commonly called walking pneumonia. Watch for physical
symptoms like low fever, coughing and chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   There are some less likely causes of troubling night sweats,
including certain medications, a heart attack or heart disease,
lymphoma and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: If you're often up because of night sweats, or if
they persist for several weeks, see your doctor.
 &UR; TWITCHES AND CRAMPS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You're drifting off to sleep when one of your legs twitches or
your whole body jerks _ and you're awake. Annoying, but normal.
These involuntary movements are known to occur when you shift from
one stage of sleep into another. They are caused by a sudden
electrical discharge within the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no apparent reason for them,'' Siwek says, ``and
since they're not dangerous to you, no preventive measures are
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a leg cramp or charley horse in your calf muscle that
disrupts your slumber is distressing but generally not a cause for
worry.
</P>
<P>
   What to do: To prevent pesky, painful leg cramps, try this
exercise before bedtime: Sit on the floor with your legs
outstretched. Flex your toes toward your knees, so your calves and
foot muscles are stretched and limbered. Hold for several minutes.
This exercise may also help to relieve a cramp.
 &UR; DIZZINESS AND LIGHT-HEADEDNESS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever rolled over at night and snuggled deep into your
pillow, only to feel as if you're still rolling and the room is
spinning?
</P>
<P>
   ``You may have a problem with inner-ear balance, triggered by a
virus or hereditary factors,'' says Dr. Blackwell Evans, an
associate professor of medicine at the Tulane University Medical
Center in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Call your doctor the following day for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   Light-headedness when you stand up _ to go to the bathroom, say
_ is caused by a drop in either blood pressure or pulse rate and
can be triggered in several ways. Rising too quickly can cause the
wobbles in people who have low blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, blood-pressure or heart medications, diuretics and
some antidepressants can bring on light-headedness. Check with your
doctor if you take any of these medications and experience
dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Evans says, be aware that ``stroke is a possibility when
dizziness is also accompanied by a lack of coordination, slurred
speech or numbness of the face. This constellation of symptoms
requires immediate medical attention.''
</P>
<P>
   What to do: Slight light-headedness after standing up from a
reclining or sitting position is probably not cause for alarm. But
vertigo that persists or is accompanied by a lack of coordination
or a numbness of the face requires that you seek immediate medical
attention.

ALBRIGHT'S TURN 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretaries of state, the human embodiment of White
House foreign policy, are always fair targets for critics eager to
influence diplomacy abroad or politically undercut a president at
home.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Madeleine Albright's star power immunized her
from the usual imperious second-guessing that plagued her male
predecessors, even the redoubtable Henry Kissinger. But
international affairs are perpetually chaotic in one area or the
other, and current problems that once seemed manageable are now
tottering toward full-blown world crises.
</P>
<P>
   These include a leaderless Russia, the escalating war between
the United States and terrorist networks, the peace process
stalemate in the Middle East, Iraq's continuing defiance of arms
inspectors, the Balkan civil war, Asia's economic decline, nuclear
tests in Pakistan and India, and murder and mayhem in Africa. Not a
short list.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's ill-timed visit to Moscow highlights the
present unease. When Russia's economic and political debacle
erupted, Clinton could not back out of the journey for fear he
would make matters worse there. Yet the pictures of him and Boris
Yeltsin, two discredited leaders side by side, added to the sense
of political disaster here at home.
</P>
<P>
   It is ridiculous to blame Albright entirely for American failure
to calm down all the world's hot spots in the two years of her
tenure, but some foreign policy experts are beginning to do so
anyway. As her boss, President Clinton, is now vulnerable to
charges that he is no longer able to lead, and as his agent, so is
she.
</P>
<P>
   Charges by U.N. inspectors that she tried to dissuade them from
provocative missions searching for hidden Iraqi nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons plants have provoked anger in Congress. Many
of her activist policy statements, in some cases amounting to
ultimatums to other countries, have not achieved their stated goals
partly because of foreign resistance to U.S. arrogance.
</P>
<P>
   These developments can be viewed as serious defeats for our
foreign policy or as temporary setbacks along a careful strategy
that will succeed eventually, depending on whom you listen to.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the reversals are due to many factors, including
congressional control of the purse strings and President Clinton's
lack of enthusiasm about taking tough international steps that
might isolate us from our allies.
</P>
<P>
   All secretaries of state, who are appointive creatures, must
rely on reflected authority from their mentors in the White House.
In the male-dominated foreign policy establishment, Albright, as
the first female to head the State Department, is even more
dependent on the image of power flowing from a strong, supportive
president than a male secretary might be.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has dealt with Albright knows she is no sissy, no
dummy and no stranger to Washington and international intrigue. She
earned her foreign policy stripes long before she became U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations. It is a tribute to her
intelligence, courage and political skills that she has survived at
all.
</P>
<P>
   That said, it is true that with the president weakened by his
own troubles there is no one to usefully counter whispers that her
effectiveness is waning along with her influence.
</P>
<P>
   Where once she was untouchable, now no complaint is too petty.
She has even been attacked for her loyalty to Clinton, for heaven's
sake.
</P>
<P>
   It was suggested that as a female she had an obligation to stand
up for American womanhood by denouncing the president for having
sex with an intern in his office and lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is an insult to Albright to define her by her gender. She
is the secretary of state, entrusted with a high-ranking, unisex
role that obliges her to articulate and carry out the
administration's foreign policy. Like all Cabinet officers, she
serves the country at the pleasure of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Her job description does not include the freedom to attack her
employer in public for private behavior that she may disapprove of.
That is for others to do.
</P>
<P>
   She has accepted the president's trust. To turn on him when he's
down would indicate she lacks character as much as he does.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Albright's own character appears sound and we will
see no betrayal of Clinton from her. She has defended him stoutly
and she will not sell out now to add to the damage already done to
his credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she is not indifferent to her gender. She has already
done a great deal to advance women's rights in her own way,
demanding that the oppression of women around the globe be targeted
in all U.S. efforts on behalf of human rights. She has also pressed
for more opportunities for females in the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's legacy will rest not on her position as a female role
model. It will rest instead on her skill at rising above personal
criticism as well as on the extent of Clinton's perceived weakness
and on the ability of his opponents at home and abroad to take
advantage of our troubles.

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Were you ever at the mall and couldn't remember where you parked
the car? Gotten home from the market and realized you forgot the
milk? And your daughter's anniversary has never slipped your mind
... until this year.
 &HT;    It's so frustrating, and worse, if you're getting on in years,
you worry whether this could be the beginnings of Alzheimer's
disease, the devastating disorder associated with aging and memory
loss.
 &HT;    According to memory experts, though, it's not time to panic.
Most likely, you're suffering from a common condition referred to
as age-associated memory impairment, or ``benign forgetfulness.''
And with a little strategy and perseverance, you can even learn how
to compensate for it. Relax, you're not losing your mind!
 &HT;    Who said it's all downhill from here? Contrary to what was once
thought, senility is not inevitable as times passes. Twenty percent
of mature adults experience no discernible drop in their mental
faculties.
 &HT;    Researchers, in fact, have found that poor memory in mature
adults can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. That is, if you believe
your memory gets worse when you get older, you give up more easily.
 &HT;    In China, where there are no stereotypes about age and mental
decline, seniors performed much better on tests than same-aged
Americans.
 &HT;    But age can take a toll, and IQ has nothing to do with it. The
first sign is slower recall and more difficulty learning new
things, says geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director and
chief executive officer of Friends Hospital in Philadelphia. Your
ability to memorize an address given to you in a distracting
environment like a party may drop off. Or you may need to pause a
few seconds to come up with the name of the movie you saw last
night.
 &HT;    You may start to notice the changes in your 30s, but it's
generally not significant until you're 60, Gottlieb notes. And what
is normal may surprise you: In a national study on memory loss by
the Charles A. Dana Foundation, nearly half of 45-year-olds
surveyed said they had problems recalling names.
 &HT;    There are actually three types of memory, each influenced
differently by age, explains Dr. Milton Alter, clinical professor
of neurology at Allegheny University of the Health Sciences in
Philadelphia.
 &HT;    Long-term memory enables you to remember things about your best
friend in grade school and is the least affected by advancing
years. Intermediate memory _ say, remembering an appointment _ may
wane a little more over time.
 &HT;    Most vulnerable to age is short-term memory, says Dr. Alter, a
neuroepidemiologist. This is why you may be flabbergasted to find
you can't remember something you were discussing 10 minutes ago.
 &HT;    To understand how memory works, think about it as a three-step
process. First, you receive the information; then, you store it;
eventually, you retrieve it.
 &HT;    Memory loss can occur at the first step, for instance, if you
weren't concentrating when someone was telling you something. While
it's true that we lose upward of 50,000 brain cellS a day (eek!)
and that our brains peak in young adulthood, it's the way we encode
and retrieve information _ steps two and three _ that cause most
memory lapses in the elderly, says Dr. Thomas Swirsky-Sachetti, a
neuropsychologist and associate professor at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia.
 &HT;    ``In your younger days, you could just let that grocery list
wash over you one time without thinking. Older people have to be
more active and conscious about encoding the information in their
brains,'' says Swirsky-Sachetti.
 &HT;    Mature adults, he explains, must develop strategies to file
their thoughts so they are easier to retrieve. Because their minds
have accumulated so much information over the years, their memory
banks are difficult to sort through and access otherwise.
Visualization, associations and written reminders may do the trick.
 &HT;    Nor is it always age. Medical problems can affect your memory,
too. Psychological stress such as grief or fatigue, substance
abuse, vitamin deficiencies or illnesses from thyroid disease to
infections can all interfere with remembering.
 &HT;    More startling, 15 to 20 percent of memory problems in the
elderly are caused or worsened by medications they are taking,
Gottlieb says.
 &HT;    Even your mood can cause forgetfulness. Depression is
responsible for 10 percent of memory complaints in those over 65,
says Swirsky-Sacchetti, who does testing of memory and other
cognitive functions. Anxiety _ having a lot on your mind _ also
hampers memory, he adds.
 &HT;    If you're worried about your memory or that of someone close to
you, talk to your primary care physician first, Gottlieb says. If
needed, your doctor can refer you to a specialist who can perform a
complete evaluation that would include a physical exam, personal
interview and screening tests that measure a range of cognitive
skills, including concentration and orientation.
 &HT;    If you're under age 75, the chances are you don't have
Alzheimer's or clementia. In these diseases, memory loss is usually
accompanied by other problems, such as speaking difficulty,
disorientation or a sudden inability to perform familiar tasks.
 &HT;    Another tip-off: Over a period of six months, the person with
dementia or Alzheimer's will show a progressive decline, as opposed
to the spotty defects of someone with normal memory loss, Alter
says.
 &HT;    Much like muscles that grow flabby if not exercised, your memory
requires daily toning. Some researchers speculate that memory loss
blamed on physical aging may be an offshoot of retirement when
mental activity can fall off. The golden rule of memory is ``use it
or lose it.''
 &HT;    ``Remain active in tasks that require thinking _ travel,
discussion groups, museum-going, concerts, reading, socializing and
new opportunities,'' Alter recommends. Consider that your abstract
abilities and vocabulary can improve well into your senior years
with continued learning.
 &HT;    You can even have fun while tuning up your memory. Many find
that playing cards, doing crosswords or taking interesting classes
works for them. Regular physical exercise that improves circulation
_ how about dancing? _ can sharpen the brain's performance as well.
 &HT;    Try to lay off optional medications, too. To get to sleep, try
listening to music or reading instead of taking sleeping pills that
can cloud memory, Alter suggests.
 &HT;    ``Sleeping pills, relaxants, anti-anxiety medications and
moderate amounts of alcohol all can interfere with alertness
because the mature person's tolerance to them is reduced,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Think of practicing the memory strategies listed below as the
equivalent of wearing glasses for failing eyes. It's no shame, and
a small effort to make for being able to find those darn keys!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: IMPROVING RECALL  
 &HT;    Recalling names: Conjure up a mental picture or association to
remember names. Repeat the name in conversation and ask how to
spell it.
 &HT;    Absent-mindedness: Block out distractions. When you run upstairs
to get your checkbook, think about nothing else until the item is
in your hand. If you're interrupted, cue yourself by turning a
watch or ring inward as a reminder that you were in the middle of
doing something.
 &HT;    On the tip of your tongue: Anxiety is a mental block, which is
why wracking your brain for a word usually doesn't work. The
thought will likely pop into your head later when the mind has more
time to scan its reserves. Sometimes, running through letters in
the alphabet can trigger the sound of the word you're searching
for.
 &HT;    Losing things: Select a permanent place for frequently misplaced
items such as keys. Say out loud for reinforcement, ``I'm leaving
the keys on the hallway table.'' To find a missing item, retrace
your steps and recall as many details as possible. One recollection
can trigger others.
 &HT;    Where's the car?: Before you walk away from your parked car,
pretend that your mind is a camera and record a snapshot
perspective of your car's location. At the mall, be attentive to
landmarks such as banners or storefronts. Better yet, try parking
in the same area each time.

 By ANN ORR  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Seventy-five-year-old Rollie Howes never figured he'd have any
use for computers, much less the Internet. But thanks to some
persistent arm-twisting by his nephew, he borrowed a laptop
computer and took the plunge.
 &HT;    Within 24 hours, Howes went from techno-novice to dedicated Web
surfer. The clincher was when he was able to locate long-lost
photos of the submarine he served on in World War II.
 &HT;    Howes is in good company on the Net, with more and more seniors
going online every day. Retired Rutgers professor Isabel Wolock
used the Internet to book a vacation villa in Spain and keeps up
with book, movie and theater reviews by visiting the New York Times
Web site.
 &HT;    Sixty-one-year-old auto executive John Grettenberger uses
America Online's Personal Finance Channel to track his investments
and frequents the Mayo Clinic's site for the latest information on
health-related issues.
 &HT;    There's something for everyone on the Net, whether you're 7 or
70. For seniors who have never touched a computer, how to get
started is the biggest concern _ and, indeed, getting hooked up is
the greatest challenge of the whole online experience.
 &HT;    Perhaps the best way to begin is with the help of a friend who's
already computer-savvy. If technology-minded friends are in short
supply, there's a terrific paperback book, ``Young   Heart,
Computing for Seniors'' (McGraw-Hill, 1996, $22.95), that tells you
all you need to know to successfully use a computer and hook up to
the Internet.
 &HT;    Classes in computer use and the Internet, offered by public
libraries and community colleges, are another popular and
affordable way in which people of all ages can get started.
 &HT;    Once you're online, the choices of interesting things to do are
endless. E-mail is particularly useful; it's a great way to stay in
touch with friends and the grandchildren. You can even send them
animated, talking greeting cards.
 &HT;    A growing number of quality Web sites are being created
especially for older computer users. In addition to news, feature
articles and advice, many have ``chat rooms'' or bulletin boards
where visitors can gather to ``talk'' and exchange information.
 &HT;    On the Internet you'll find information on virtually any topic,
including health, nutrition, travel, finance and various leisure
activities.
 &HT;    Get connected, and check out these great Web sites:
 STARTER SITES  
 &HT;    + SeniorCom (www.Senior.com). Want to check out retirement
communities without leaving your house? How about chat with others
or find out what events and classes are scheduled in your area? You
can do all this and more at this informative site. Best of all,
there are hundreds of links to other useful Web sites focusing on
travel, health and wellness, social security, services for the
aging and more.
 &HT;    + The American Association of Retired Persons (www.aarp.org).
Here's the place to find out where the AARP stands on issues of
importance to seniors. There's also a wealth of information on such
topics as health and aging, money management, wills and living
trusts, and grandparents raising grandchildren. AARP members can
get discounts on car rentals, hotels, airlines and even online
services (800-424-3410).
 &HT;    + SeniorNet (www.SeniorNet.com). This nonprofit organization's
site offers chat rooms and discussions on politics, travel,
gardening and health, with links to senior organizations and
publications on the Web. SeniorNet also teaches adults (age
50-plus) to use computers and the Internet at more than 140
learning centers nationwide. Call 415-495-4990 for information on
courses.
 TRAVEL  
 &HT;    + CyberRentals (http://cyberrentals.com). Planning a vacation?
Visit this site that lists homes, condos, chalets and other real
estate available for rent. Booking a beach house in the Virgin
Islands or a waterfront cottage on Lake Michigan has never been
easier. Each listing includes a description and photo of the
accommodations, rates and contact information.
 &HT;    + Yahoo! Seniors' Travel Pages
(www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Travel/Seniors/Airline_Programs/). If you
need to make an airline reservation, be sure to stop by this site
first. You'll find information about special fares as well as links
to several major airlines' senior citizen discount programs. Other
features of this Web site include car rental and hotel
accommodations information plus a mechanism for checking flight
times.
 HEALTH AND NUTRITION  
 &HT;    + Mayo Health Oasis (www.mayohealth.org). For information on
health, nutrition and exercise, the Mayo Clinic's site is terrific.
The Medicine Center pages are particularly useful; you can look up
8,000 prescription and over-the-counter medications to learn about
side effects, interactions with other drugs and so on. You can also
post questions to Mayo Clinic physicians and search the site by any
subject.
 &HT;    + OnHealth.com (www.onhealth.com). What ails you? This excellent
Web site lets you check an extensive disease database, gives you a
set of tools to retrieve and save important personal health
information, and keeps you up-to-date on the latest news in
medicine.
 FINANCE  
 &HT;    + AOL's Personal Finance Channel. America Online members will
want to take advantage of this excellent resource that lets you
stay up-to-the-minute on the latest financial news. You can track
your investments online, find mutual funds that match your needs
and obtain expert advice on retirement planning, insurance and
more.
 &HT;    + Money Magazine (www.money.com). This site offers interesting

 &HT;    + Time Magazine (www.time.com). The online version of this
publication brings you national and international news, plus
coverage of the arts, politics, money and technology. The site is
searchable, so you can quickly key in on just those articles that
interest you. There are lots of opportunities to contribute as
well, through polls and surveys.
 HOBBIES  
 &HT;    + Amazon.com (www.amazon.com). With 3 million titles, this site
beats any bookstore, hands down. Here you can read book and music
reviews, purchase these items in a secure ordering environment and
search an extensive database for books on any subject you desire.
 &HT;    + Epicurious (www.epicurious.com). If cooking is your passion,
this is the place to be. Features include a recipe file containing
more than 7,600 recipes from Bon Appetit and Gourmet magazines,
along with restaurant reviews and practical kitchen tips. On the
forum pages, you can communicate with other culinary enthusiasts to
find just the right ingredients for that Key lime pie Aunt Martha
used to make.
 &HT;    + Ancestry.com (www.ancestry.com). The ultimate resource for
those interested in tracing their family roots, this site offers
genealogy lessons, an ancestry search (90 million names!) and
recommendations for helpful genealogy books, magazines and Web
sites.
 &HT;    + Yahoo! Hobbies and Crafts Links
(www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Hobbies_and_Crafts/). Most of the search
engines (like Yahoo!, Excite and InfoSeek) have pages such as this
one. Type in the word ``hobbies'' in the search field and you'll
come up with a page of links to hobby sites. Just about every
leisure time activity has a site somewhere on the Web, be it
astronomy or woodworking, gardening or ham-radio operation. If you
don't find links for your particular hobby on Yahoo!'s page, try
one of the other search engines.

 By JERE DANIEL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It was a gray November day when my wife and I drove up to her
83-year-old mother's home in suburban New York. As we trudged up
the crumbling front steps, we stopped, stared and asked each other
the same question: ``How will she make it through another winter?
Who's going to shovel the driveway when it snows? And who'll fix
these steps?''
 &HT;    On our next visit, my wife summoned up the courage to ask her
iron-willed mother, Fay, whether she didn't think it was time to
consider living someplace else.
 &HT;    Remembering the previous year's Siberian winter, Fay hesitated.
Finally she asked, ``But where would I go?''
 &HT;    It took many months of searching to answer that question, but we
eventually learned that there is a large and growing range of
housing options for the elderly _ be they able-bodied or in need of
regular medical care _ all of them tailored to preserve what older
people want most: their independence.
 &HT;    The best solution for my mother-in-law proved to be a co-op
apartment in a building that has a ``buddy system'' whereby
residents look after one another. The building is located in the
same town she has always lived in, but in an area that has stores
and apartment buildings that have attracted many of its older
residents.
 &HT;    Here are some other elder housing choices that we considered.
 HOME-SHARING  
 &HT;    Sharing living space with a roommate is perhaps the simplest and
most underused way for an elderly person to alleviate loneliness
and strained finances. The practice is becoming increasingly
popular, however, especially with women over the age of 65, says
Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource and Policy Center on
Housing and Long-Term Care at the University of Southern California
in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Home-sharing may mean simply renting out a vacant room, or it
may involve modifying one's home to turn unused space into living
quarters.
 &HT;    The National Shared Housing Resource Center in Baltimore is a
nonprofit agency that screens and matches those who need a home
with those who wish to share theirs, making home-sharing safe and
systematic. The center works through 350 local affiliates and has
made thousands of matches, says its director, Mark Benson.
 &HT;    ``We also provide publications and technical assistance for
those who want to convert and finance homes for sharing,'' he adds.
 COOPERATIVE LIVING  
 &HT;    Communes _ communities where people share work and
responsibilities for each other, and live in commonly owned housing
on commonly owned land _ exist throughout the country and are
actually on the increase. Most of them are intergenerational, that
is, filled with people of every age, a factor that makes them
especially attractive to older people.
 &HT;    A new variation of the traditional commune is called cohousing.
In these newer style communes, residents still co-own the land and
benefit from central services such as meals and recreation, but
live in individually owned homes on the property.
 &HT;    Cohousing communities are often started from scratch. People
bent on creating a community purchase land together, then build
homes and a large community house. They govern their community
democratically, often sharing social activities, meals, child care
and maintenance equipment such as trucks, snow plows and
lawnmowers.
 ECHO HOUSING  
 &HT;    ECHO houses are attractive compact homes, fully equipped and
often all or partially prefabricated, that are placed next to a
parent house _ frequently that of a grown childfrom which they
typically draw utilities and water.
 &HT;    In Australia, where they originated, they are called granny
flats; grandchildren can drop in several times during the day for
cookies and milk, and grown sons and daughters can keep a watchful,
caring eye on their parents.
 &HT;    ECHO houses (an acronym for Elder Cottage Housing Opportunities)
are sometimes subsidized by community social service agencies. Or
they may be purchased for $26,000 to $36,000. When the ECHO house
is no longer needed, it can be resold, moved and hooked up at
another site.
 CONGREGATE HOUSING  
 &HT;    Congregate housing typically consists of 20 or 30 small living
units (each with bedroom, bath and sometimes cooking facilities) in
one building or in a group of buildings joined to a hub facility
that provides meals and social activities.
 &HT;    While congregate communities are primarily for ambulatory
seniors, most such facilities do have an on-site supervisor for
safety and security, and ready access to local health services for
routine medical care and emergencies.
 &HT;    Congregate housing is often sponsored by social, religious,
fraternal or community agencies.
 ASSISTED LIVING  
 &HT;    Essentially, assisted living is a residence for the mentally
and/or physically frail who do not quite need the full care of a
nursing home but do need some personal care and supervision
available around the clock.
 &HT;    Some candidates for assisted living may suffer frequent
confusion and bouts of forgetfulness and need help with daily
routines. Residents receive their meals, assistance with
medications, grooming and other personal care according to their
individual needs, limited health-care services, supervision and
companionship.
 &HT;    Assisted-living residences _ which typically feel more homey
than institutional _ are usually for-profit businesses.
 &HT;    Whitney Redding, spokeswoman for the Assisted Living Federation
of America, a trade organization based in Fairfax, Va., says,
``What makes assisted living unique is its philosophy of promoting
independence and dignity for residents in a comfortable, homelike
setting.''
 CONTINUING CARE  
 &HT;    Continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs) may consist of a
single building or a whole village serving 500 residents.
 &HT;    CCRCs accommodate everyone from the totally independent to the
completely incapacitated in units ranging from small houses and
apartments to full-fledged nursing homes. They provide a lifetime
continuum of housing and health care. Residents move from level to
level as their health changes.
 &HT;    While some facilities are sponsored by community, religious or
fraternal organizations, a growing number are run by commercial
interests such as hotel chains and insurance companies. Residents
pay monthly fees starting at about $2,000, which guarantees them
the care they need.
 &HT;    At the luxury end of continuing-care retirement communities,
residents pay a substantial entry fee _ of several hundred thousand
dollars _ and purchase the guarantee of care for the rest of their
lives in plush accommodations. They get all home maintenance,
recreation and nursing care for as long as they need it, paying
monthly fees of anywhere from $750 to several thousand dollars.
 &HT;    CCRC payment arrangements vary from facility to facility. Be
sure never to sign a contract without checking its provisions _ and
the sponsor's financial stability _ with a lawyer.
 &HT;    The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) and the
American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging (AAHSA)
offer guides spelling out such precautions.
 &HT;    A personal visit is essential before selecting any elder living
arrangement. The AARP and AAHSA can provide you with a checklist to
help you evaluate a facility. Observe the staff for its competence
and friendliness; rate both the living quarters and health-care
services.
 &HT;    Remember that if you are selecting a new home for an elderly
parent or other relative, you should be as critical as you would be
for yourself.

BAY STATE SAT SCORES REMAIN STEADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JORDANA HART  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts high school students' SAT scores were
unchanged from last year, remaining the highest they have been in
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The average verbal score at the state's public and private high
schools was 508, three points above the national average. The
average math score also was 508, four points below the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   But the latest state-by-state SAT report card, released Tuesday
by the College Board, shows that Massachusetts girls saw on average
a two-point drop to 504 on the verbal test between 1997 and this
year, while boys saw a three-point rise to 513. Nationally, girls
averaged 502 points compared to 509 points for boys on the verbal
part of the test, formerly the Scholastic Assessment Test.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in girls' scores, locally and nationally, may well
be nothing more than a statistical blip but nonetheless it nags at
some testing specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most noteworthy thing is the gender gap (on the verbal
test) and that it has increased nationally,'' said Charles Rooney,
assistant director at FairTest in Cambridge, a watchdog agency that
charges that standardized tests are biased against girls and
students of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``On math, where most of the attention is focused, the gap is
large but diminishing,'' Rooney added. ``But in verbal, the fact
that there is a gap at all is disturbing. Women take many more
advanced courses in those areas.''
</P>
<P>
   In math, Massachusetts girls scored an average of 492 points, 34
below the boys' average math score. Nationally, the gender spread
in math is 35 points, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
   Some cited that nationwide more girls than boys are taking
advanced courses in math and science, more are taking the SAT, and
more are going to college. The data show that 54 percent of college
entrants are girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls now are significantly the majority going to college,''
said Seppy Basili, director of precollege programs for Kaplan
Education Services, the national test preparation company. ``That
could explain some of the change. The larger the number of students
who take (the test), the more likely scores go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston school officials said the city's SAT scores were not
immediately available Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after two years of boasting the nation's highest
percentage of high school seniors taking the SAT, Massachusetts
this year slipped to fourth with a 77 percent participation rate,
slightly behind the District of Columbia (83 percent), Connecticut
(80 percent), and New Jersey (79 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 80 percent of Massachusetts seniors took the SAT. The
state's test-taking rate remains well above the national rate of 43
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, state education officials and others cautioned against
reacting to the recorded drop in the participation rate, saying it
could well be a statistically insignificant change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has dropped, but it is not a concern yet,'' said David
Driscoll, interim education commissioner for the state. ``If it
becomes a trend over time, then we have to look at it. Remember,
this data is a snapshot of this year, so I would not jump at any of
the statistics.''

   MICROSOFT-JUSTICE (Washington) In a sharply worded legal brief,
government lawyers have accused Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and
other company executives of an ``astonishing lack of recall'' when
the officials are questioned about the Redmond-based software
giant's conduct. ``Executives who are stated to be the author of
documents claim not to remember writing them,'' said the brief.
``Executives who are the stated recipients of documents claim not
to remember receiving them. And both authors and recipients claim
not to know what the documents mean.'' Lawyers for the federal
government, 20 states and the District of Columbia complained of
Gates' conduct in an 89-page brief urging a federal judge not to
dismiss the government's anti-trust case against Microsoft.

YELTSIN TELLS CLINTON RUSSIA WILL NOT BACK AWAY FROM DEMOCRACY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Caught in the swirl of political turmoil, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin assured President Clinton on Tuesday that
there would be no retreat from democracy as the former communist
superpower works through its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin, opening a two-day summit here at an awkward
time, greeted each other with a bear hug and a hearty handshake as
Russia's foundering economy rattled stock markets worldwide,
including in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton called himself a friend bearing tough news as he
warned young Russians there are no painless solutions to the
financial situation. He challenged Russia to adopt financial
changes to encourage international investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be discouraged, but don't be deterred,'' Clinton told
students at the Moscow State University of International Relations.
``Just keep working until you get it in place. Once you get it in
place, Russia will take off like a rocket, because you have both
natural resources and people resources.''
</P>
<P>
   As they met at the Kremlin, Yeltsin handed Clinton a large,
round loaf of bread that the American squeezed. When it bounced
back into shape, Clinton remarked, ``Amazing, kind of like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Questions have arisen over how much control Yeltsin actually has
over the government but administration officials pronounced him as
``vigorous'' and engaged in the private discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton attempted to stay above the internal politics but aides
said both Yeltsin and acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
``confirmed their staunch commitment to reform and vowed that there
would be no retreat.''
</P>
<P>
   Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state, said, ``I don't
think there is any question that there is fundamental support for
democracy on the part of the Russian people. We're going through a,
to put it mildly, interesting and uncertain and difficult episode
right now, but we have not heard anything while we have been here
that calls into question that democracy is the path to which this
country is committed.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Russians indicated there may be an increased role for
the state in some areas, ``but it certainly would not mean a going
backward toward communism,'' said Larry Summers, deputy treasury
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in order to evaluate this, what we're going to just
have to do is wait and see what kind of plan the Russians come up
with and what kind of actions they take, because it's the actions
that are ultimately going to be important,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's inability to form a new Cabinet has left it unable to
form a new economic plan to rescue the plunging ruble, its ailing
banking system and its nearly insolvent stock market. The
International Monetary Fund is awaiting a new Russian plan before
releasing more installments on Russia's $22.6 billion bailout fund.
</P>
<P>
   The political intrigue continued as Yeltsin pledged he would
renominate Chernomyrdin as prime minister, a day after the
Communist-led Duma overwhelming rejected him.
</P>
<P>
   The vote ended a hope of reviving a compromise that called for
an 18-month truce to allow Yeltsin to install a new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chernomyrdin is the candidate I have chosen for prime minister
and I will insist upon it,'' Yeltsin told reporters. The Duma may
vote Friday or Monday on the renomination. If it rejects Yeltsin's
choice three times, the Duma can be dissolved and new elections
called.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin is pushing the nation to a civil war,''
charged Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov. Clinton will meet
Wednesday with Duma leaders. The Communists are pressing for
greater state control over the economy and the state takeover of
some industries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, appearing later at an elementary school and a
university as Russians began their first day of classes, challenged
Russia to continue its market reforms and to take active steps to
lure investments.
</P>
<P>
   Russia must have a stable revenue source through fair taxation
that allows it to pay its bills. Printing money to pay bills and
bail out banks will not help; special bail-outs for the privileged
few damage the whole nation and fair treatment for investors will
determine future investments, Clinton said. ``I come here as a
friend, because I believe in the future of Russia,'' Clinton said.
``I come here also because I believe someone has to tell the truth
to the people, so that you're not skeptical when your political
leaders tell you things that are hard to hear. There is no way out
of playing by the rules of the international economy if you wish to
be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also cited the history of the United States as an
example of a sometimes difficult road faced by a democracy. There
was the British burning of Washington, the Civil War, the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger point I want to make as Russia goes through this
time of extreme difficulty is that over the life of our democracy
we have had many intense, even bitter, debates,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also responded to his critics who had urged him to
cancel the summit because both he and Yeltsin are in political
trouble and because of Russia's crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed there were some doubters back in America who said
perhaps I shouldn't come here because these are uncertain times
politically and economically. And there are questions being raised
in the American press about the commitment of Russia to the course
of reform and democracy. It seems to me that anybody can get on an
airplane and take a trip in good times, and that friends come to
visit each other in challenging and difficult times. I come here as
a friend, because I believe in the future of Russia,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin signed two military-related agreements. One
would reduce the amount of plutonium stockpiles by 50 tons in each
country. The United States claims to have 100 tons of plutonium,
the key fuel in nuclear weapons, while Russia claims to have 150
tons.
</P>
<P>
   The two also agreed on an early warning system that would
require each side to notify the other any time it detects a missile
launch. They claim the early warning agreement will reduce the
danger of an inadvertent launch because of a false warning alert.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ During the Cold War, U.S. satellites watched for Soviet
missile launches, a sign that the United States might soon be under
nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nuclear standoff is over, the United States has
found a new use for its warning systems: to alert Russia about
missile launches around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
plan to sign a new accord under which the former antagonists will
instantly share data about the launch of ballistic missiles and
space boosters.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's economy deteriorating by the day and the Yeltsin
government gripped by a political crisis, arms control no longer
holds center stage. But the missile warning agreement has captured
the imagination of veteran summit-conference observers, who recall
Ronald Reagan's heady dream of developing ``Star Wars''
anti-missile technology and sharing it with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord's objectives, of course, are not nearly as grand,
although they are still important.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington has become
increasingly worried that Russia's warning system is so frayed that
Moscow might misinterpret the data and mistakenly conclude that it
was under attack. The result could be an accidental nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an abstract concern. For a few tense moments in 1995,
the Russian military misread its data about the launch of a
Norwegian scientific rocket as a possible submarine missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement provides further protection against an
inadvertent nuclear exchange triggered by misidentification of a
launch,'' said Robert Bell, a senior aide on the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's surprise test firing of a missile over Japanese
territory Monday also underscored the potential of launches to
unnerve neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Russian early warning system has many
deficiencies. The government's cash crunch has forced Russia to
limit the deployment of warning satellites. Some ground-based
radars are in ill-repair. Others ended up on the wrong side of the
border after the Soviet Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian radar station at Skrunde, Latvia, was closed Monday.
Latvia had initially allowed the radar station to operate after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, but finally concluded that it no
longer wanted to serve as a Russian military outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's strategic
rocket forces, said the Skrunde station's shutdown would seriously
strain Russia's warning network. Eventually, the military hopes to
build a replacement station in Belarus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The missile data accord was not the only measure intended to
cope with the new dangers that have arisen following the Cold War.
Wednesday, the two nations also plan to sign an agreement calling
for the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Russia and the United States would each
remove 50 tons of plutonium from its military stockpile and dispose
of it by using it as fuel in nuclear reactors or mixing it with
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the details have yet to be negotiated, including the
pressing question of how to pay for the Russian program to use the
plutonium as reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said the program could take more than five years
_ an estimate that some observers regard as optimistic. Even so,
the 50 tons of Russian plutonium to be disposed represents only a
quarter of Russia's estimated supply.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. officials say the accord establishes an important
precedent: plutonium is not a resource to be husbanded, as the
Russian nuclear established often argues, but a danger.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is the missile data agreement that is the closest to
be put into action. U.S. officials said they hoped the system will
be operational in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now receives data about enemy missile launches
from two sources: early warning satellites that detect the heat
from missile launches and powerful radars in Greenand, Britain,
Alaska and along the U.S. coasts.
</P>
<P>
   That data is synthesized at military processing centers and
transmitted to the Pentagon, U.S. military commanders and allies.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord, however, would add a new recipient: the
Russians. The missile information could be transmitted directly to
a Russian command post, such as the Center for Space and Military
Situations near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Or a U.S.-Russian joint command center might be established and
the data sent there. That would enable the two sides to discuss the
information and provide another check against misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if Norway launched another scientific rocket, the
Americans would quickly provide data on the origin and time of the
launch, its trajectory and moment of expected impact. There would
be no more tense moments when Russian commanders struggled to
figure out if the launch was malevolent or benign.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. launches would be included in the data dispatched to the
Russians. But the United States will probably withhold information
on Russia's own missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is that the Russians might launch missiles and then
use the U.S. data they received to determine the limits and
vulnerabilities of the U.S. early warning system. Even as the
United States seeks to broaden its cooperation with Russia,
military rivalry lingers on.
</P>
<P>
   To supplement the system, the United States is also calling for
a new international arrangement in which nations would provide
advance notice of their missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, an expert on nuclear command and control systems at
the Washington-based Brookings Institute, said the accord will help
Moscow and Washington better understand the spread of missile
technology in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   It could, he notes, also represent an initial step toward
cooperating in the development of anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good idea on several levels,'' Blair said. ``It would
alleviate coverage gaps and false alarms that could be a source of
trouble.''

   RUSSIA-RESCUE (Undated) _ Plan A, a $23.6 billion program
courtesy of the IMF, failed in less than four weeks. Plan B, a
devaluation and debt moratorium cobbled together by young Russian
reformers, collapsed within days. Neither prevented investors from
fleeing or citizens from turning every ruble they have into
dollars. So what options are left for restoring financial
stability? By Slyvia Nasar.

   RUSSIA-SCENE (Moscow) _ As Muscovites defied a cold rain to
methodically pick grocery shelves clean of goods they expect will
soon disappear, President Clinton stood Tuesday morning in the oval
office _ Boris Yeltsin's marble-and-bronze, oval-shaped study in
the Kremlin _ and pushed the heel of his hand onto the top of a
fat, round loaf of Russian bread. Each time the bread bounced back.
``Amazing,'' Clinton told Yeltsin. ``Kind of like you.'' So he
hopes. By Michael Wines.

<P>
   RUSSIA-ARMS (Moscow) _ During the frigid days of the Cold War,
American satellites watched for the fiery launchings of Soviet
missiles, a sign that the United States might soon be under nuclear
attack. Now that the nuclear standoff is over, the United States
has found a new use for its warning systems. It plans to employ
them to alert the Russians about missile launches around the world.
On Wednesday, President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin plan
to sign a new accord under which the former antagonists will
instantly share data about the launch of ballistic missiles and
space boosters. By Michael R. Gordon.

   MARKET (New York) _ It's the day after the second-largest point
drop ever, and the market has been up and down. At the close, the
industrial average was up 288 points points, the second-largest
point gain ever. Overseas, prices rose 1.9 percent in Tokyo but
fell 2.9 percent in Hong Kong. They rose 0.9 percent in Frankfurt
and but fell 1.3 percent in London. On the American debt market, at
midday, the long bond was down 1 8/32 point, with the yield at 5.34
percent. By Edward Wyatt.

   ELDERHOSTEL (Kotzbebue, Alaska) _ Martha Rowe, three weeks shy
of her 77th birthday, found herself heading out of Kotzebue on a
beat-up yellow bus with a taped-together steering wheel, cracked
windshield and seats that slid around with every bump and curve in
the unpaved road. Her destination was a primitive fish camp on a
narrow strip of gravel beach between the tundra and the Chukchi
Sea, on the outskirts of Kotzebue, 26 miles above the Arctic
Circle, closer to Russia than Anchorage. ``I wanted an adventure,''
said Ms. Rowe, a retired clinical director of physical therapy at
the University of Florida in Gainesville. So did her fellow

TURMOIL IN RUSSIA DRAGGING DOWN S. AFRICA'S ECONOMY
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-SUMMIT, RUSSIA-SCENE, RUSSIA-ARMS,
RUSSIA-POLITICS) 
 (nk) 
 BY DONALD G. MCNEIL JR.  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ In the 1980s, the apartheid government
was obsessed with fear that it would be overrun by Communist-backed
black guerrillas, and it presented the Soviet Union as a vast
menace that justified brutal oppression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, it never was much of a threat,'' said Sampie
Terreblanche, professor of political economy at Stellenbosch
University here. ``Now, in the new South Africa, the collapse of
the new Russia seems to be quite threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 economic crisis in Russia has hit South Africa hard,
dealing a sharp blow to an emerging economy already hurt by the
Asian crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, the Johannesburg Stock Exchange was down 42
percent from its historic high of 8,359 on April 20. The rand,
worth about 15 cents, is touching new lows. In 1982, it was worth
$1.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, which stood at $278 an ounce Tuesday, hit $273 an ounce
last week, its lowest price since 1985. Interest rates have soared.
Mortgages are now 23.5 percent, and the prime rate is 25.5 percent,
both record highs.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of borrowing rose for the government, too. Long-term
government bonds sell at yields of nearly 22 percent. In April,
they were about 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In some economists' views, South Africa is just another victim
of investor nervousness about emerging markets. But to others, this
particular crisis is worse because its roots are in Russia. Russia
exports many of the same commodities that South Africa does: gold,
diamonds and strategic metals like palladium and titanium. Both
also export weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious concern is commodity price fears,'' said Dennis
Dykes, chief economist for Nedcor, a bank holding company. ``Russia
may sell all it can, driving prices down.''
</P>
<P>
   The old wisdom that gold does well in bad times does not apply
here. ``Panics in the 1970s were inflationary scares,'' Mr. Dykes
said. ``This is a deflationary environment, and interest rates are
high worldwide. Gold is the last thing you want to own. People fly
into dollars or Deutschemarks.''
</P>
<P>
   While South Africa has been battered by global markets, its
sell-off had a local trigger: last Tuesday night's bomb blast at a
Planet Hollywood restaurant, in which one person was killed and 27
others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   To foreign investors, the Achilles heel of South Africa is fear
of political instability. Thanks largely to Nelson Mandela's
popularity, the government here seems quite secure, despite growing
anger about high crime rates. The bomb may turn out to be the work
of a few cranks, but it blew up at a touchy time.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   South Africa has suffered more than some emerging markets
because steps taken since the 1994 elections to draw foreign
capital into this long-isolated economy have also made it easy for
that capital to flee. Unlike the currencies of India or China,
Dykes pointed out, rands are easily sold for dollars. There are no
limits on how much foreigners can take out.
</P>
<P>
   As a bellwether of the effect of the Russian crisis on the whole
continent, South Africa is probably not much use. Though its
economy is only about the size of Belgium's, it dwarfs other
African economies. On an index of 47 emerging market exchanges
rated by Salomon Smith Barney, South Africa is the only sub-Saharan
entry. Also, no other African economy is well integrated into the
world financial system; their stock exchanges are tiny, and their
currencies respond more to political events than to market
speculators.
</P>
<P>
   While it is linked to the world economy, South Africa has a long
tradition of going its own way. Economically, Terreblanche said,
its ``40 fat years'' were from 1934, when getting off the gold
standard pulled it out of the Great Depression ahead of other
countries, to 1974. After that, the struggle against apartheid led
to capital flight, sanctions cut off foreign investment, and the
wars against guerrillas sapped the state's resources.
</P>
<P>
   Recovery has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1974, it's lean years,'' Terreblanche said. ``We've had
average 1.4 percent GDP growth and 2.5 percent population growth,
so we've been in creeping poverty for 24 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That disparity _ slow economic growth versus rapid population
growth _ will probably bedevil the African National Congress
Government for years to come, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Terreblanche fears a depression and unemployment riots if the
markets keep sinking.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts are also pessimistic. ``Those who have jobs
should consider themselves lucky and stick to them,'' said Dawie
Roodt, an economist with Equisec.
</P>
<P>
   A few financial advisers, trying to remain upbeat, point out how
many bargains the stock market rout has created. The recent rash of
initial public offerings was full of computer and Internet stocks
that were due for a fall, they said, but long-established
industrial, food and mining houses that are well-managed and have
little debt were probably oversold.
</P>
<P>
   And Alec Hogg, publisher of a financial Web site, did not even
want to write off gold shares. ``Gold's a funny thing,'' he said.
``Every time you write it off as dead, it jumps up and bites you
big.''

PROSECUTORS SECRETLY QUESTIONED LEWINSKY LAST WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a secret meeting with prosecutors last week,
Monica Lewinsky answered additional questions under oath that were
intended to highlight any discrepancies between her grand jury
testimony and the sworn testimony given by President Clinton, two
lawyers familiar with the inquiry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, prosecutors told the former White House intern that
it was the last time she would be required to answer questions in
connection with their investigation of the president, the lawyers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour meeting was held Aug. 26 at the offices of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr on Pennsylvania Avenue, just a
few blocks from the White House. The questioning was recorded by a
stenographer, possibly to be shared with grand jurors in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky, 25, appeared for the second time before the grand
jury Aug. 20. That same day, Linda Tripp, a former colleague of Ms.
Lewinsky's who testified for eight days before the grand jury, also
met with prosecutors at the independent counsel's office to answer
a series of follow-up questions, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' behind-the-scenes, last-minute meetings with
their two most important cooperating witnesses represent another
sign that Starr is nearing completion of a widely expected report
to be forwarded to the House of Representatives. Two lawyers
familiar with the inquiry said Tuesday that a report most likely be
completed by the end of September. At that point the House
Judiciary Committee will be obligated to consider whether
impeachment proceedings against Clinton are warranted.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In last week's question-and-answer session, Ms. Lewinsky was
asked a series of specific questions about sexual encounters she
had with Clinton in the White House during their 18-month
relationship, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Her responses go directly to the heart of Clinton's own grand
jury testimony Aug. 17 in the Map Room of the White House. The
president testified that he had had ``inappropriate intimate
physical contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky, but he declined to discuss
any specifics, according to lawyers familiar with his testimony. He
also insisted that he had not lied in his deposition in the Paula
Jones sexual misconduct lawsuit, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, prosecutors have asked Ms. Lewinsky very
specific questions about her encounters with the president, the
lawyers said. In recent weeks, prosecutors have discussed the
possibility of accusing Clinton of lying to the grand jury when he
testified that the ``intimate physical contacts'' he had with Ms.
Lewinsky did not meet the definition of ``sexual relations''
established in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the definition pertains to touching certain parts of
the body, but not others, and the president's advisers have said
they do not believe the definition covers certain activities,
including oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was also asked questions about several gifts given
to her by the president. As a centerpiece of Starr's inquiry into a
possible obstruction of justice, prosecutors are investigating
whether Clinton conspired with Ms. Lewinsky to conceal the gifts
from the Jones lawyers, who sought the gifts in a subpoena last
December.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Prosecutors asked Ms. Lewinsky additional questions about her
recollections of conversations with the president and Betty Currie,
Clinton's personal secretary, about the gifts and other issues, the
lawyers said. Ms. Lewinsky was given complete immunity from
prosecution in July in exchange for truthful testimony before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a day when Starr's grand jury usually meets, the
federal courthouse was quiet. The grand jurors are also not
expected to meet Thursday. But one lawyer said that the grand
jurors had not completed their work and would probably meet again.
</P>
<P>
   During the president's contentious testimony Aug. 17 that was
transmitted live to the grand jury, prosecutors said they might be
forced to subpoena Clinton after he declined to answer certain
questions. However, a lawyer familiar with Starr's plans said the
office would most likely not seek additional testimony from the
president. Aides to Clinton said he was prepared to challenge a
subpoena on constitutional grounds.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, members of the House Judiciary Committee have
dropped not-so-subtle hints that they hope Starr submits an
``executive summary'' with his report. A summary would give an
overview without divulging secret grand jury testimony, they said.
In that format, the committee would then be free to make that
portion of the report public without violating rules that require
grand jury testimony to be kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer who claims to be familiar with Starr's plans said
Tuesday that Starr's office was likely to include an executive
summary in its report to the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have gotten the message,'' the lawyer said. In
addition to a report and a summary, Starr's office also plans to
turn over to Congress ``a mountain'' of other material, including
transcripts of grand jury testimony, the videotape of Clinton's
deposition and the 20 hours of audiotapes of conversations between
Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly, a spokesman for Starr, declined to comment
Tuesday, saying he could not even confirm that a report was being
prepared.

   BALZAC-FILMS (Undated) _ Suddenly, movie makers are landing on
Planet Balzac. On Friday, two films on the French writer Honore de
Balzax, representing two extremes of his oeuvre, are opening. One
is ``Passion in the Desert,'' an impressionistic allegory that has
been adapted by the American director Lavinia Currier for her first
feature from an eight-page short story of 1830. The other is a new
adaptation of ``Cousin Bette,'' the sprawling 1847 drama of manners
that is one of Balzac's best-known novels; this movie is the first
to be directed by the Tony-winning theater director Des McAnuff
(``Big River,'' ``The Who's `Tommy' ''). By Jean Nathan. (Moved).

   MULTI-ACT-BALLETS (Undated) _ Today, when abstractions dominate
many ballet repertories, it's tempting to proclaim plots
unimportant. Dance is an art of movement, and the best story in the
world cannot disguise unimaginative choreography. Nevertheless,
should choreographers wish to tell tales, good stories can help
make good choreography look even better. This is especially true of
full-evening productions. Recent months have offered several
imposing multi-act story ballets, ranging from Marius Petipa's
19th-century blendings of classicism and exoticism to Boris
Eifman's contemporary balletic expressionism. By Jack Anderson.

<P>
   EQUESTRIAN-DANCE (Paris) _ Equestrian art may be as old as
ancient Greece, but Bartabas, the founder and director of the
Paris-based Zingaro Equestrian Theater, still likes to think he is
doing something new. He may well be right. Carving a niche for
himself somewhere between the classical 1implied dressage of, say,
Vienna's legendary Spanish Riding School and the athletic antics of
circus 2horses, the 41-year-old Frenchman has created an equestrian
show that underlines the emotional power of 3horses. By Alan

   HANDEL-OPERAS (New York) _ Handel has changed. For pretty much
two centuries after his death, in 1759, he was remembered primarily
as a composer of oratorios, anthems, concertos, suites and sonatas:
music that bolstered a gentlemanly image of magnificence and
decisiveness. His operas, so much more pliant and equivocal in
tone, were largely forgotten until the 1920s. On Friday, the second
night of its new season, the New York City Opera will present
Handel's ``Partenope'' in a production introduced at Glimmerglass
during the summer, and two new recordings of other Handel operas
have just appeared on the Virgin Veritas label. By Paul Griffiths.

emasculated by dismissals and resignations, or have they been

CLINTON TELLS RUSSIANS PROSPERITY WILL FOLLOW HARDSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton warned the Russian people Tuesday
that they are at a ``critical moment'' in their pursuit of
capitalism and pleaded with them not to revert to communist rule in
the face of economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving here Tuesday morning with advice but no economic aid,
Clinton lectured Russians that they must persevere against hardship
to reap the benefits of democracy. He likened the nation's painful
seven-year conversion toward a free market system to the United
States' long and sometimes tortured history of civil war,
segregation and economic depression, with pain leading to
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are enormous,'' Clinton said in a lengthy speech at
the Moscow University of International Relations. ``Every choice
Russia makes today may have consequences for years and years to
come. Given the facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not
believe there are any painless solutions, and indeed, an attempt to
avoid difficult solutions may only prolong and worsen the present
challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin greeted each other at the
beginning of this bizarre summit with a warm handshake and a
lengthy bearhug Tuesday morning before repairing to Yeltsin's
opulent presidential study for a 90-minute meeting dedicated mostly
to the political and economic turmoil in Russia. Yeltsin, according
to US officials, vowed that he would maintain his pursuit of
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are expected to sign today what aides describe as a
pivotal agreement calling for wholesale reduction in plutonium
supplies and the creation of a new early-warning system to avoid
mistaken retaliation against any missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents met with aides over an elaborate lunch at the
Kremlin, then again for a dinner that ended nearly an hour ahead of
schedule without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip marks the fourth summit in five years between
Clinton and Yeltsin and their first meeting in 18 months. But this
time each leader appears dramatically weakened in his own country.
Yeltsin is hobbled by his ailing economy and health; Clinton is
wounded by his myriad legal problems in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this city and across the country, the Russian economy
lies near ruin. The nation's monetary instrument, the ruble, has
lost over 40 percent of its value in the last two weeks. The
Russian stock market has shed nearly 90 percent of its worth, and
the government is in such chaos that the Duma, the lower house of
the parliament, refuses to confirm a prime minister to run the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Yeltsin, and for that matter, the acting prime
minister (Viktor Chernomyrdin), confirmed their staunch commitment
to reform and vowed that there would be no retreat,'' said Strobe
Talbott, the deputy secretary of State who was present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, Talbott said, appeared ``vigorous, very much engaged,
very much on top of the extremely difficult situation that he is
trying to deal with,'' in sharp contrast to some press reports that
his health is ailing if not failing and his mind is unable to grasp
the importance of the nation's plight.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's vow of reform served as a balm to US officials, who
weathered an appalling stock market drop of their own on Monday.
Any hint that the Russians planned to bolster state control of the
economy was considered an anathema to efforts to guide the nation
along a path of lasting reform, and it could carry repercussions in
financial markets around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yeltsin, through his news service, also made reference to
``strengthening the state role in the economy,'' in remarks that
caused distress among US officials, who, in turn, said they had to
wait and see his plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking in a soothing voice in his afternoon speech to
Moscow students, delivered a blunt message of pain and sacrifice.
He warned Russians that they must improve their tax collection in
this time of crisis, refrain from printing more money that could
cause inflation to soar, refuse to bail out some members of a
privileged class at the expense of the nation, and treat foreign
creditors equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that the American people very much want
Russia to succeed,'' Clinton said. ``We value your friendship, we
honor your struggle. We want to offer support as long as you take
the steps needed for stability and progress. We will benefit
greatly if you strengthen your democracy and increase your
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, behind the scenes, US and Russian officials finalized
the details of two national security pacts Tuesday that will be
signed by their leaders today, including one calling for the
wholesale disposition of plutonium reserves that could be used to
build nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, each country will dispose of 50 metric tons
each of plutonium -- enough, according to US officials, to build
``thousands of nuclear weapons.'' Some of the plutonium reserves
will be used to fuel nuclear reactors, and other parts will be
mixed with radioactive nuclear waste and stored in repositories.
Currently, the US claims to have 100 metric tons of plutonium and
Russia 160 metric tons.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those who have been skeptical about what might come out of
this summit, this is one very positive thing that will come out,''
said Republican Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, who is
traveling with Clinton on the trip. He added: ``That's rather
historic.''
</P>
<P>
   The second agreement calls for the two countries to share early
warning information on the worldwide launches of ballistic missiles
and space vehicles -- a pact intended to alleviate the possibility
of a nuclear strike by one country over a misinterpretation of
data. The agreement has been discussed since a 1995 summit.
</P>
<P>
   But far and away, Tuesday was a day of subdued ceremony and
sobering reality. In the morning, Clinton led his entourage to the
Kremlin where, in a cold, steady rain, he slowly walked behind two
goose-stepping guards and laid a wreath on the Tomb of the
Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   He then climbed into his limousine and sped off to his first
meeting with Yeltsin. The Russian leader greeted Clinton like an
old friend, hugging him in front of the gathered crowd. Yeltsin
presented Clinton with an old American flag that had been given to
Russian leaders by a US delegation in 1866, and a loaf of bread,
against which Clinton pressed with his hand and watched it bounce
back into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' Clinton declared to Yeltsin. ``Kind of like you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, also
made a stop at a Moscow elementary school, where Mrs. Clinton told
reporters, ``I've been getting along fine.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Moscow University for International Relations, Clinton
spoke for over half an hour in the afternoon about the need for
Russians to follow mainstream economic principles to dig their way
out of financial crisis. Time and again, he stressed the critical
nature of the juncture at which Russians have arrived, and in each
reference exorted them to stay on the road to economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's adress was a message of hope and friendship that was
warmly received inside the school auditorium, filled with an elite
group of Russian college and graduate students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very inspiring for us,'' said Rina Solkolova, a
17-year-old student at the Financial Academy. ``Some people are
saying we're going back down and everything's coming to an end and
we will have communism again, but there is hope at the end of
this.''

   KOTZEBUE, Alaska _ Martha Wroe made up her mind years ago that
there were two things she would never do when she got old. ``I was
not going to be one of those old ladies clutching their purses to
them wherever they went,'' she said. Nor was she going to be the
sort of traveler who viewed the world from the safety of a cruise
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Which was why, three weeks shy of her 77th birthday, Ms. Wroe
was bracing herself against the wind as she made her way across a
stretch of rain-soaked tundra on Alaska's northwest coast, 26 miles
above the Arctic Circle, wearing a fanny pack. This old lady had
left her purse behind, in Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted an adventure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So did her fellow travelers, 13 other older men and women on a
weeklong journey with Elderhostel, the nonprofit organization that
arranges affordable, educational trips for people 55 and over.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing the more traditional, less physically challenging
Elderhostel experience _ studying the Civil War in New Orleans,
say, or Mozart's operas in the Berkshires _ they had left a world
of comfort and ease to sit by the sea at the margins of the
continent, pick salmon out of a net and bask in the light of the
midnight sun.
</P>
<P>
   As exhilarating as all that was, though, they were also on a
journey that extended beyond geography and scenery. At a time in
their lives when their hair was turning gray, they were traveling
from a culture that worships youth and denies age to one that
reveres its elders. Among the Inupiat Eskimos, there are no senior
citizens, no elderly, only elders. This is a place where old age is
an achievement. Elders are to be respected. A highlight of the week
was meeting Alaska natives who had survived 60, 70 and 80 winters
on this desolate strip of land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my gray hair and wrinkles,'' said Beulah Commack,
an Inupiaq Eskimo elder nearing 70 who was the camp cook. ``God
made me this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Many things happened in this week. Men and women who did not
know each other shared meals, jokes, stories and secrets _ and the
outhouse at the primitive fish camp that was their home base. No
one talked much about the jobs or titles they had once held. These
were people living in the present, looking ahead and thinking about
what they wanted to do with the time they had left.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Field, 68, from Tucson, Ariz., who volunteered for outhouse
duty, had been a radiologist in Maine. He had loved practicing
medicine, and retired with difficulty, but ``I've fallen in love
with my wife all over again,'' he said. His wife of 45 years, Ann,
64, had retired as an oncology social worker, but what she had
always wanted to be, what she now had the time to be, in a way, was
an anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to see a walrus head?''
</P>
<P>
   Maryann Mendenhall, a 69-year-old Inupiaq, had already told her
Elderhostel visitors about the time she killed a polar bear. She
had told them about toughing out winter in the days before
electricity and snowmobiles. The visitors in her living room
definitely wanted to see the walrus head.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mendenhall disappeared into the back of her house and
returned dragging the huge skull of a walrus she had bagged some
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I try lifting it?'' asked Ms. Wroe, a retired clinical
director of physical therapy at the University of Florida. It was
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she were not a noted hunter, Mrs. Mendenhall would be an
elder by virtue of her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you survived one year here, you could understand what it is
to survive 70 years,'' said Ruth Sampson, 43, an Inupiaq who talked
about the elders with the Elderhostel travelers. ``Whether you're
an Eskimo or white, you sure do command respect for your ability to
survive winter in this cold and unfriendly environment.''
</P>
<P>
   As for death, like the endless winters, it is faced
unblinkingly. In Kotzebue, the cemetery is next to the playground.
``When your time comes, your time comes,'' Mrs. Sampson said,
quoting an elder she knows. ``You can't go over it, beside it or
under it. You have to go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Elderhostel travelers had to survive was one week in
mid-August. There are no roads into Kotzebue. Landing at the
airport, they were met by a broken-down yellow bus with a cracked
windshield, taped-up steering wheel and seats that slid off their
frames around every bend in the unpaved road.
</P>
<P>
   Six miles out of town, they came to a narrow strip of gravel
beach with a jumble of drafty cabins, salmon cutting sheds, caribou
bones and a couple of outhouses. On one side was Kotzebue Sound,
feeding into the Chukchi Sea. On the other was tundra. Down the
beach was a dead walrus. This was LaVonne's Fish Camp. LaVonne
Hendricks, a commercial fisherwoman and former public health nurse,
was their trip director.
</P>
<P>
   All was far from ready. One cabin was empty, without a stick of
furniture. A blackboard listing the day's chores included ``Make
Beds.'' A handyman eventually showed up with a hammer, nails and
wood and made two beds. It would be a metaphor for the
improvisational nature of the week. There was no schedule, Ms.
Hendricks told them, ``only possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh my God, what have I done!''' Ms. Wroe confided
that evening, over group cocktails _ cheap wine poured from a
cardboard box. The friend she had persuaded to join her, Claudette
Finley, 59, had wondered the same thing. ``I thought, `I'm going to
kill Martha Wroe,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the fish camp turned out to be an excellent
icebreaker. Chuck and Martha Willis, from Dayton, Ohio, said they
had broken their rule for Elderhostel trips. ``We only look at the
ones that have private baths,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner _ caribou soup and chum salmon, just caught _ the
talk of Elderhostel trips taken continued. Dick and Ann Field were
on their eighth; they had watched whales off Baja California,
explored Native American culture at a Hopi reservation, dabbled in
alternative healing in Montana.

7 PERCENT UNEMPLOYMENT AMONG NEW DOCTORS, AMA SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Refuting the folk wisdom that becoming a doctor brings the
ultimate in employment security, the American Medical Association
reports that many newly minted physicians are having trouble
landing a job.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7 percent of the doctors who finished their residency
training two summers ago were still looking for a position six
months later, according to the first survey of its kind. Another
22.4 percent said they had trouble finding a suitable post.
</P>
<P>
   Some newly trained specialists had it even worse. Among
ophthalmologists (eye specialists) and oncologists (cancer
specialists) about one in every eight were unemployed for at least
six months after graduating.
</P>
<P>
   Other specialties with job problems included hematology,
pathology, geriatrics, anaesthesiology, gastroenterology,
infectious disease, pulmonary disease, critical care medicine,
plastic surgery, and radiology. Up to half the new graduates in
these specialties said they had trouble finding a position.
</P>
<P>
   Physician unemployment rates were also high among graduates of
non-US medical schools (a rate of 14 percent), minorities (11
percent), and women (8 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Even in general internal medicine _ the specialty that
policymakers say the nation needs more of, in contrast to fancier
subspecialties _ 11 percent of 1996 graduates couldn't find
immediate employment. Another 23 percent said they had trouble
finding a job.
</P>
<P>
   The problem reflects a long-forecast ``doctor glut'' predicted
as long ago as 1980, experts say, and it is likely to get worse.
``There is consensus within the medical profession that the country
is on the verge of a serious oversupply of physicians,'' write
Rebecca S. Miller of the American Medical Association and her
colleagues in a report published in the current Journal of the AMA.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Barach, who finished his anesthesiology residency at
the Massachusetts General Hospital this week, said his classmates
were able to find jobs, although not necessarily in locales they
preferred. But he said fledgling doctors can no longer take a first
job for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago you'd get 10 offers,'' Barach said. ``Today you
have to use the alumni list and go out and beat the bushes. People
anticipate having problems finding the job they want.''
</P>
<P>
   New physicians' ability to find jobs ``will become more
difficult as more patients are enrolled in managed care, and as we
find that less-intense care leads to as good an outcome,''
predicted Itzhak Jacoby of the Uniformed Services University of the
Health Sciences in Bethesda, who has studied physician supply
issues for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Physician unemployment has been a hidden problem until now,
Jacoby said, because no one has surveyed new residency graduates
until now. The survey collected data from 12,135 doctors who
completed their training in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Before now, the only data on new graduates' employment came from
surveys of residency program directors. But the new survey's
authors, who also polled residency directors, conclude that program
directors' information is unreliable because it was not
systematically collected. In the new survey, program directors
reported that only 1.2 percent of their graduates had not found
jobs within six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Program directors are not in touch with reality, and are
reluctant to admit that they're training people who are not sought
after,'' Jacoby said.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors may also contribute to worsening employment
prospects for physicians. Non-physician care-givers _ a diverse
group that includes nurse-practitioners, physician assistants,
chiropractors, acupuncturists, podiatrists, and nurse anesthetists
_ are challenging the monopoly that doctors once held, and their
numbers are growing exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   The number of new non-physician clinicians doubled between 1992
and 1997, and is expected to grow by another 20 percent by 2001,
according to an article in the current Journal of the American
Medical Association, where the new physician employment survey also
appears.

 KOTZEBUE, Alaska: in Montana. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From a handful of offerings at New England colleges with 240
participants 20 years ago, Elderhostel has grown so that its
catalog lists 10,000 programs that are attended by more than
300,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Harris, 61, from Salem, Ore., who had just retired from
nursing, had come with her cousin, Dorothy Parrott, 64, from
Eugene. Mrs. Harris' husband, Ed, died seven years ago. Mrs.
Parrott's husband, Glenn, died of a heart attack a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parrott was doing the dinner dishes on a table outside with
two other women. ``Glenn died the day after my birthday,'' Mrs.
Parrott said. ``It's like I've been cut, and a part of me is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulled down the neck of her sweatshirt to reveal a tattoo,
of a broken heart. ``I got this six months after my husband died,''
she said. The women clasped her arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Elderhostel travelers were to spend the week meeting Inupiat
elders and experiencing their traditional way of living off the
land and sea. That meant, for starters, going out on a boat to pick
salmon off the net, then gutting it, drying it on racks and smoking
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everyone to have a direct relationship with a fish,''
Ms. Hendricks announced the first night.
</P>
<P>
   Willis, a foundation executive, whispered to his wife, a retired
nurse, that he was not going to touch any fish. Hours later, near
midnight but with plenty of daylight left, he was on a boat near
shore, up to his elbows in salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The second day it rained. The group went on a tundra walk
anyway. The tundra, a carpet of blueberries, crowberries, dwarf
birches and wildflowers over a layer of permafrost, is spongy and
difficult to walk on even when rain has not dotted it with
knee-deep puddles.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Wroe quickly fell behind, a small figure in an oversized
yellow rain suit. The others kept stopping to see if she needed
help, but she waved them on. Once or twice she fell. But eventually
she caught up, at a lake where the group was watching a pair of
Arctic loons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by the tundra,'' Field said during a group
discussion the morning after the walk. ``I could have spent a
couple of hours up there on my hands and knees,'' Mrs. Field added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loons were spectacular,'' said Bernice LaPorte, 66, who
was on the trip from northern Maine with her husband, George. ``And
the yellow canary.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone gave a cheer for the canary. Later, Ms. Wroe said, ``I
wanted to make it. I was thinking, what a thrill, here I am above
the Arctic Circle, and I may never do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the week went on, the group met more Inupiat, at the fish
camp or in their homes. The elders all had thoroughly modern
bathrooms, the use of which they offered to their grateful
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Growing older in a changing world, the elders from the lower 48
and those from the Arctic discovered they were dealing with many of
the same things.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Norton, an 85-year-old elder just back from three days of
camping on the tundra to pick berries, complained that she had
recently acquired a new house in town but her husband was refusing
to move.
</P>
<P>
   The Fields understood the conflict. Field would have liked to
stay in Maine in retirement, but the Arizona climate was better for
his wife's arthritis. ``It was my turn to follow her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left a community where we were somebodies,'' Mrs. Field
said. ``Then you move to this large community where nobody knows
who you are. It's humbling. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   And George LaPorte, a retired dentist who is an avid hunter and
fisherman, knew how Mrs. Norton felt when she told the group, ``I
still feel young.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I'm 69,'' LaPorte said, flipping hamburgers on
the grill one evening. ``I can't believe I'm going to be 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Commack, the camp cook, was moved hearing Mrs. Parrott talk
about her late husband. Mrs. Commack's husband died three years
ago. ``I still miss my old man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Elderhostel travelers worry about losing touch
with younger people, the Inupiat in many cases face a greater
divide. Their way of life has been sharply eroded over the last
half-century by everything from missionaries to television to the
tourists they were now entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children don't speak Eskimo,'' Mrs. Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the commonalities, the Elderhostel visitors were all
too aware of how different it was to be old in the lower 48. ``I'm
just starting to get this subtle feeling that I'm not as visible as
I used to be,'' said Martha Willis, who is 62. ``I'm getting a
little less eye contact from the young, a little less
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to embrace the word elder,'' she said toward the end
of the week. ``I like it better than senior citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean to be a senior citizen, anyway? ``In the lower
48 it means getting discounts and things like that,'' Lois Harris
said during a group discussion. ``Here, it means self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather itself was a test. It rained hard for five days. The
waves reached the outhouse door. ``My kids told me, `Mom, get a new
life,''' Mrs. Parrott said as the bus forded the flooded road on
the way to town one day. She laughed. ``I'm not sure this is what
they meant.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun reappeared on the last evening. Mrs. Parrott and Mrs.
Harris dipped their feet in the Chukchi Sea.
</P>
<P>
   At a closing ceremony around the dinner table, everyone talked
about what they would take away.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harris told the group, ``This will help me with the journey
I'm on. I'm 61, I'm still young. What am I going to do with the
time I have left? What meaning can I find?''

PLAN TO REDUCE AID TO SCHOOL-BASED CLINICS UNDER FIRE IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Politicians and other foes of the ``religious
right'' lambasted Health Commissioner Dr. William ``Reyn'' Archer
III on Tuesday for reducing state aid to school-based clinics,
calling the move a ``crazy political decision'' that will harm
minority and low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates for Texas' 125 school-based clinics urged Archer
to reverse his plan not to seek new start-up funds next year. They
claimed Archer caved in to critics of family planning and abortion
counseling at the expense of vulnerable children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am always amazed when politicians attempt to make health
care less accessible,'' said state Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos,
D-Austin. ``I am totally astounded when a physician does so.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer disputed those claims, saying he made his choice to allow
for a complete assessment of existing clinics and to see how other
state and federal health-care initiatives will work.
</P>
<P>
   When he disclosed his plan two weeks ago, Archer said
school-based clinics may duplicate existing services and could
bring family-planning services into communities that don't want
them. In a statement issued Tuesday, he said, ``I have no intention
at this time of eliminating (state) funding for school-based health
clinics.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer said rather than commit to three more years of start-up
funding, his agency first should examine the impact of changes to
programs including Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance
Program and Texas Healthy Kids Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the clinics, including Democratic lawmakers and a
group formed to challenge religious conservatives, claimed Archer
unilaterally scuttled the program, which serves about 250,000
students statewide, in order to please the American Family
Association and Texans United for Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether Mr. Archer is acting independently or in conjunction
with interest groups or party leaders is up for speculation, but
what is clear is that a right-wing political agenda has won out
over the needs of Texas children,'' said Texas Freedom Network
spokesman Samantha Smoot.
</P>
<P>
   Smoot said there is no evidence to support Archer's earlier
contentions that the clinics duplicate other services and force
family-planning counseling on unwilling communities.
</P>
<P>
   Barrientos said Archer failed to adequately consult lawmakers
before making his decision.
</P>
<P>
   School nurses cannot always meet students' health-care needs, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be standing here if they were,'' Barrientos said.
School-based clinics usually help with minor injuries, health
exams, immunizations, allergy problems and other concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The legislator said he may ask fellow lawmakers to override
Archer's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this unwise, silly, crazy political decision stands,
absolutely in January we'll come in and try to make it right,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Dawnna Dukes, D-Austin, said the clinics fill a gap
in the health-care safety net by helping low-income, minority
families in areas where there aren't enough doctors, including
big-city neighborhoods in Austin and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children in those schools don't have many alternatives,''
Dukes said. ``We should not play with the lives or the health of
young children on political platforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Roberto Gutierrez, D-McAllen, joined the chorus, saying
Archer's move was in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of doing away with them, we should expand,'' he said.
``This is the way to have healthy children.''

RUSSIA'S PROBLEMS HAS HOUSE GOP DIVIDED OVER NEW IMF CONTRIBUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The current economic turbulence has widened the
gulf dividing Republicans over whether to approve new financing for
the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Congress appeared certain to increase the American contribution
to the fund when lawmakers left on a monthlong recess in August.
But as the Senate resumes business this week, and the House due
back next week, the new financing is now teetering on the brink
with each day's gloomy financial news.
</P>
<P>
   Critics led by Rep. Dick Armey, R-Texas, the House majority
leader, say the fresh financial turmoil in Russia underscores their
belief that replenishing the fund's reserves now would only throw
good money after bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is now undeniable that the IMF has played a
destabilizing role in world financial affairs,'' Armey said in a
letter to House members Tuesday. ``Russia simply took the IMF's
latest $4.8 billion loan installment and threw it into the currency
markets where it was instantly vaporized.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the embattled fund argue that the current
crisis is proof that the United States can not be shielded from
other nations' problems and that Congress must act quickly to
approve the administration's $18 billion request to avert even
greater financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbol as much as anything else that the world
community will try to contain the meltdown of the international
monetary system,'' Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who heads the
Appropriations Committee, said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   These divergent views illustrate the split among Republicans,
particularly in the House, between free-market purists who
criticize the IMF's secretive practices and internationalists who
say the fund is essential to help maintain stability in the
increasingly global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Congress approved President Clinton's full request
tomorrow, the money wouldn't extinguish the current financial
fires. The funds are meant to help avert future crises.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters say the new financing would offer an immeasurable
psychological balm to Wall Street and other world markets,
demonstrating that Congress and, more broadly, the United States is
standing four-square behind the world's lender of last resort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Markets respond to confidence and the IMF is one of those
confidence builders,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., an ardent IMF
supporter.
</P>
<P>
   This is an argument that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan have been making on Capitol
Hill for months. It's a theme that's been hammered home by business
groups like the Chamber of Commerce and farmers, who are watching
exports to Asia dwindle or disappear altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Why would Republicans, traditionally the party of big business,
block something that Wall Street would embrace? Mainly because the
popular notion that the Republican Party and Wall Street walk in
lock step has been steadily eroding since Republicans like Sen.
Arthur Vandenberg led the party away from isolationism after World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very uneasy relation between U.S. corporate
interests and the GOP majority, particularly in the House,'' said
Edmund Rice, executive director of the Coalition for Employment
through Exports, a trade group that supports new IMF financing.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans ``are more grounded in small-town, rural, religious,
political interests,'' Rice said. ``They're much more focused on
domestic issues and suspicious of international involvement and
certainly of large U.S. corporations.''
</P>
<P>
   The more internationally minded Senate overwhelmingly approved
the full $18 billion months ago, and was expected to reaffirm that
vote again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the House leadership has balked. The House seemed prepared
to follow the Senate in late July, when Armey conceded that
supporters probably had the votes. But his apparent acquiescence
upset House conservatives, and Armey quickly reversed himself and
vowed to fight on.
</P>
<P>
   The about-face also grew out of the political battle over the
House leadership between Armey and Rep. Robert Livingston of
Louisiana, who heads the House Appropriations Committee. Both men
want to be Speaker if Newt Gingrich steps down to run for President
in 2000 and have been trying to curry favor among House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Armey counts among his strongest supporters the House's most
conservative members, who are also most opposed to American
involvement in international organizations like the IMF and the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, who supports the IMF, has been reaching out for
support to business groups, who favor more money for the fund. But
the recent events in Russia may be giving Livingston pause.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Morra, Livingston's spokeswoman, said the senator
wants to finance the fund but that he backs ``a newly reformed''
IMF. The Foreign Operations subcommittee approved $3.4 billion for
the fund earlier this summer, with the expectation that the full
$18 billion would be approved eventually on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   To placate conservatives, the subcommittee attached several
conditions to the new financing, requiring the IMF to charge
higher, market-determined interest rates and publicly disclose more
details about the fund's decision-making. The fund has been making
some of these changes on its own in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the public cares about all this is unclear. Even as the
American stock market plunges, fueled in part by the political and
economic uncertainty in Moscow, lawmakers say there is no public
pressure to shore up the IMF
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exactly a burning issue with most people,'' Rep. Jim
Kolbe, R-Ariz., an IMF supporter, said Tuesday from Tucson.

   BOSTON _ Deborah Gaines had just stepped inside the Preterm
Health Services clinic after a cigarette break when she heard the
gunshots. It was Dec. 30, 1994, and John Salvi III had opened fire
in the Brookline clinic's waiting area.
</P>
<P>
   Backing away as Salvi came toward her, firing, Gaines leaped
from the stairs, scrambled to her feet and ran. She had an
appointment for an abortion that day, but never rescheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, she gave birth to a daughter, Vivian.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``I could not see myself going back into another clinic again
after what I went through,'' Gaines said from her home in Onset
Tuesday. ``Emotionally, I was messed up, and I still am today.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gaines is suing Preterm and the owner of the building, 1842
Beacon Street Associates, for costs associated with giving birth to
Vivian and raising the child.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in Dedham Superior Court, Judge Patrick F. Brady
rejected the defendants' request to dismiss Gaines's lawsuit.
Though Brady said he was ``very, very, very, very skeptical'' of
Gaines's claims, he allowed the case to go forward. A trial date
has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   Chris A. Milne, Gaines's lawyer, acknowledged that many people
are skeptical when they first hear of the case. But he insisted
that Gaines is just trying to provide for her children.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not looking for megabucks for herself,'' Milne said.
``She's looking to make the best life she can for her daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   If Gaines prevails, any money she is awarded would go into a
trust fund to pay for some of Vivian's medical and educational
costs, Milne said. Vivian, age three, is learning disabled and
hyperactive, and Gaines said she has had to quit her job and put
her three other children in day care to look after Vivian.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is the latest in a series of actions against Preterm
and the other clinic Salvi attacked, the Planned Parenthood Clinic
at 1031 Beacon St.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Seron and Albert Walton, the two guards on duty at the
time of the shooting, have sued the clinic, claiming they are
emotionally traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where does it stop?'' asked James S. Franchek, an attorney for
1842 Beacon Street Associates. ``Everybody's jumping on the
bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Gaines gave birth to Vivian on Aug. 7, 1995. Though she says
she does not regret bearing her daughter, she believes the clinic
should pay for the cost of raising her.
</P>
<P>
   In her lawsuit, Gaines claims that the shooting was partly the
result of lax secuirty at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Given the tense atmosphere and violence at other abortion
clinics in the early 1990s, Milne said, Preterm should have been
prepared to guard against the shootings. There was a need, he said,
for full-time armed security guards, a police presence, metal
detectors, and locked doors.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys, however, say Gaines's case is outrageous.
They maintain Gaines was not in the waiting area where Salvi opened
fire, and point out that she could have had an abortion at another
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's hearing, Franchek said Gaines's claim _ that
post-traumatic stress from the shooting kept her from seeking an
abortion _ is ``not supported by logical deduction.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milne said the shooting could have been prevented if the
clinic had taken ``reasonable security measures.'' He said Gaines
continues to have nightmares and suffers from emotional and
psychological stress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gaines said she chose to have the abortion because
she was trying to put her life back together. She was on welfare
and wanted to get her GED to better provide for herself and her
children.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``I wanted to go back to school and get a good job and take
care of my kids on my own,'' she said. ``It was not the time for me
to have another child.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Gaines said, she is taking medication for
depression, and had to undergo five months of treatment for a back
injury she suffered during the incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ During the Cold War, U.S. satellites watched for Soviet
missile launches, a sign that the United States might soon be under
nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the nuclear standoff is over, the United States has
found a new use for its warning systems: to alert Russia about
missile launches around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
plan to sign a new accord under which the former antagonists will
instantly share data about the launch of ballistic missiles and
space payloads.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's economy deteriorating by the day and the Yeltsin
government gripped by a political crisis, arms control no longer
holds center stage. The idea of using U.S. military technology to
help the Russians plug the gaps in their early warning system
recalls Ronald Reagan's heady dreams of a world in which the United
States and the Russians would team up to develop ``Star Wars''
anti-missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord's objectives, of course, are not nearly as grand,
although they are still important.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington has become
increasingly worried that Russia's warning system is so frayed that
Moscow might misinterpret the data and mistakenly conclude that it
was under attack. The result could be an accidental nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an abstract concern. For a few tense moments in 1995,
the Russian military misread its data about the launch of a
Norwegian scientific rocket as a possible submarine missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement provides further protection against an
inadvertent nuclear exchange triggered by misidentification of a
launch,'' said Robert Bell, a senior aide on the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's surprise test firing of a missile over Japanese
territory Monday also underscored the potential of launches to
unnerve neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Russian early warning system has many
deficiencies. The government's cash crunch has forced Russia to
limit the deployment of warning satellites. Some ground-based
radars are in ill-repair. Others ended up on the wrong side of the
border after the Soviet Union collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian radar station at Skrunde, Latvia, was closed Monday.
Latvia had initially allowed the radar station to operate after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, but finally concluded that it no
longer wanted to serve as a Russian military outpost.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of Russia's strategic
rocket forces, said the Skrunde station's shutdown would seriously
strain Russia's warning network. Eventually, the military hopes to
build a replacement station in Belarus.
</P>
<P>
   However limited their data, the Russians would also provide it
to the United States under the new agreement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The missile data accord was not the only measure intended to
cope with the new dangers that have arisen following the Cold War.
Wednesday, the two nations also plan to sign an agreement calling
for the disposal of weapons-grade plutonium.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Russia and the United States would each
remove 50 tons of plutonium from its military stockpile and dispose
of it by using it as fuel in nuclear reactors or mixing it with
waste.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the details have yet to be negotiated, including the
pressing question of how to pay for the Russian program to use the
plutonium as reactor fuel.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said the program could take more than five years
_ an estimate that some observers regard as optimistic. Even so,
the 50 tons of Russian plutonium to be disposed represents only a
quarter of Russia's estimated supply.
</P>
<P>
   Still, U.S. officials say the accord establishes an important
precedent: plutonium is not a resource to be husbanded, as the
Russian nuclear established often argues, but a danger.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is the missile data agreement that is the closest to
be put into action. U.S. officials said they hoped the system will
be operational in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   The United States now receives data about enemy missile launches
from two sources: early warning satellites that detect the heat
from missile launches and powerful radars in Greenland, Britain,
Alaska and along the U.S. coasts.
</P>
<P>
   That data is synthesized at military processing centers and
transmitted to the Pentagon, U.S. military commanders and allies.
</P>
<P>
   The new accord, however, would add a new recipient: the
Russians. The missile information could be transmitted directly to
a Russian command post, such as the Center for Space and Military
Situations near Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Or a U.S.-Russian joint command center might be established and
the data sent there. That would enable the two sides to discuss the
information and provide another check against misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if Norway launched another scientific rocket, the
Americans would quickly provide data on the origin and time of the
launch, its trajectory and moment of expected impact. There would
be no more tense moments when Russian commanders struggled to
figure out if the launch was malevolent or benign.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. launches would be included in the data dispatched to the
Russians. But the United States will probably withhold information
on Russia's own missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   The concern is that the Russians might launch missiles and then
use the U.S. data they received to determine the limits and
vulnerabilities of the U.S. early warning system. Even as the
United States seeks to broaden its cooperation with Russia,
military rivalry lingers on.
</P>
<P>
   To supplement the system, the United States is also calling for
a new international arrangement in which nations would provide
advance notice of their missile launches.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, an expert on nuclear command and control systems at
the Washington-based Brookings Institute, said the accord will help
Moscow and Washington better understand the spread of missile
technology in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   It could, he notes, also represent an initial step toward
cooperating in the development of anti-missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a good idea on several levels,'' Blair said. ``It would
alleviate coverage gaps and false alarms that could be a source of
trouble.''

JUDGE ORDERS REPUTED MOBSTER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After reviewing more than 200 instances in which
gangster/informant Stephen Flemmi refused to answer questions
during his week on the witness stand, a federal judge Tuesday began
ordering him to answer some of them.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, Flemmi complied, telling Assistant US Attorney
Fred M. Wyshak Jr., for instance, how he knew that fellow informant
Angelo ``Sonny'' Mercurio had been tipped off to his upcoming
indictment in October 1989: ``Mr. Mercurio told me that himself.
... He told me he was going to leave town. He was prepared; he had
money and identification,'' Flemmi testified.
</P>
<P>
   But Flemmi claimed not to know how Mercurio _ who had given the
FBI the time and place of a Mafia induction ceremony so they could
bug it _ had found out he was about to be indicted along with
others who attended the secret service on Oct. 29, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wyshak said the government would not press Flemmi to
answer questions about a number of unsolved murders in which he has
been implicated but not charged, fearing the legal consequences if
Flemmi was ever charged with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Mark L. Wolf, who is holding pretrial hearings
into Flemmi's claim that he was promised protection from
prosecution in exchange for information he gave the FBI on the
Mafia, said if he forced Flemmi to answer questions about the
murders Flemmi might be able to argue later that his testimony
immunized him from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi ended more than a week of testimony last Friday. Since
then, Wolf reviewed every instance in which Flemmi invoked his
Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to determine if he
had a legal right to refuse to answer each question.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where Wolf found that Flemmi had waived his Fifth
Amendment right by answering related questions, he ordered Flemmi
to answer or face the consequences. The most serious penalty, which
Wolf indicated he was unwilling to do, would involve striking all
of Flemmi's testimony from the record, in effect negating his whole
case.
</P>
<P>
   That becomes an option if Flemmi still refuses to answer a
question after Wolf orders him to do so. He did that Tuesday,
refusing to say whether he had been told that fringe gangster
Edward ``Brian'' Halloran was cooperating with the FBI. Halloran,
who implicated Flemmi and James ``Whitey'' Bulger in the murder of
a Connecticut Jai Alai executive, was shot to death within months
of talking to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf may decide Wednesday whether the government can call an FBI
supervisor from New Jersey as a witness to testify about the
bureau's practice in dealing with top-echelon organized crime
informants like Bulger and Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors say James B. Darcy Jr., a supervisory agent
in the FBI's Atlantic City office, would testify, for instance,
that it is common for field offices not to report all instances of
an informant's alleged criminal activity to headquarters in
Washington, as required by informant guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But defense attorney Randolph Gioia argued that it would be a
``real stretch'' for a supervisor with nine years of experience
limited to New Jersey to testify about the bureau's ``routine
practices.'' He also argued that defense lawyers should have access
to Darcy's informants' files to compare how their treatment
compared to that of Bulger and Flemmi.

NEW RULES TO CONTROL DISPOSAL OF COMPUTERS, TVS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As the march of technological progress consigns more
and more computers and television sets to the junk heap,
Massachusetts officials are moving to encourage _ and force _ the
recycling of more of them.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Protection will ban
disposal of cathode ray tubes in municipal trash collections,
landfills, and incinerators after July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, the DEP will no longer require people and
businesses to file copious hazardous-waste disposal documentation
when arranging to recycle tubes (a widely flouted rule anyway), and
will give unspecified grants to cities and towns to include
computers and televisions in their recycling programs.
</P>
<P>
   DEP commissioner David B. Struhs said his agency expects te
annual volume of cathode ray tubes discarded in Massachusetts to
quadruple by 2006, to 300,000 tons, as people buy high-definition
TV sets and advanced computers, including models with flat-screen
displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons we are doing this now is we expect this
great cleanout,'' Struhs said.
</P>
<P>
   Struhs's deputy, Allan Bedwell, who developed the plan, said he
expects it will encourage a small but growing state industry of
recycling and reconditioning cathode ray tubes. The tubes can be
separated into glass and lead for reuse, or reconditioned for use
in new computers.
</P>
<P>
   Struhs announced he is awarding $17,000 to Franklin County's
trash program to expand electronics recycling in northwestern
Massachusetts and $75,000 to a University of Massachusetts program
studying new uses and markets for recycled electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Peter F. McCloskey, president of the Electronic Industries
Alliance, called the DEP program an ``innovative approach.''
Goodwill Industries predicted it would boost its training programs
for people with disabilities who are taught to recycle products.

FEW ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE FED TO LOWER INTEREST RATES

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When faced with a Latin America that could no
longer pay its debts during the summer of 1982, the Federal Reserve
put aside its tight-money policy and cut interest rates. When faced
with a stomach-churning stock market drop in October 1987, the Fed
acted quickly to pump more money into the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean the nation's central bank will now feel compelled
to bring rates down to help stem the spread of global financial
turmoil and restore some confidence to badly battered investors on
Wall Street and around the world?
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, lots of people on Wall Street and some industrial leaders
have stepped up their calls for the Fed to cut rates in the past
several days. Other countries, including Japan, have been floating
proposals for the Fed to lead a move among the most powerful
economies to bring rates down around the globe. With long-term
market interest rates already well below the official short-term
rates controlled by the Fed, investors appear to have concluded
that it is only a matter of time before the central bank begins
easing.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials themselves have encouraged the speculation by
making clear that they are less worried now than a few months ago
about the combination of strong growth and low unemployment setting
off a spiral of rising wages and prices that would demand an
interest rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   But unless the stock market drops precipitously over the next
few weeks or the still-strong domestic economy shows sudden signs
of stalling, many economists think there is little chance of the
central bank adopting a looser monetary policy anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite unrealistic to expect a Fed easing at this point,''
said Bill Cheney, the chief economist at John Hancock Financial
Services in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously if you get a real market meltdown in the style of
1987 with lots of players on Wall Street and elsewhere going broke
from losses or liquidity problems, then the Fed will pump liquidity
into the system,'' Cheney said. ``But I don't think we're at that
point, and the markets are getting ahead of themselves in terms of
talking about it. The Dow at 7,500 is not that type of situation by
a long shot.''
</P>
<P>
   If a nearly 20 percent decline in the stock market from its peak
in mid July to its sharp drop on Monday failed to force the Fed
into action, neither did the collapse of Russia. Indeed, analysts
said, rather than assuming the mantle of central bank to the world,
the Fed and its chairman, Alan Greenspan, remain focused on
tracking the domestic economy and on the institution's core mission
of maintaining price stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever people perceive a crisis, they say the Fed has to
help out,'' said Mickey Levy, an economist at NationsBanc
Montgomery Securities. ``But historically, whenever the Fed takes
its eye off the fundamentals and tries to tinker with the dollar or
some other foreign activity, that's when it makes mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan may even be silently cheering the stock market's
correction. Since the end of 1996, when he raised the question of
``irrational exuberance,'' Greenspan has been warning in
increasingly direct terms that investors had adopted an overly rosy
view of the prospects for corporate earnings, leading to an
overvalued stock market.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want risk to be undervalued in financial markets,
because that feeds through the financial system to things like bank
lending standards and creates the possibility of big destabilizing
swings in markets that could present risks to the real economy,''
Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has also been careful to point out that the Asian
financial crisis has benefits as well as drawbacks for the American
economy. With investors wary of putting their money into emerging
markets, cash has been flooding into American Treasury securities,
driving down long-term interest rates. The strength of the dollar
has held down the price of imports, and the decline in demand for
oil and other commodities throughout Asia has further helped dampen
inflation. Lower inflation has given consumers more purchasing
power.
</P>
<P>
   So while there are considerable risks from the spread of Asia's
crisis and from the market's fall, for the moment the economy
appears to be doing what Fed officials have hoped all along:
slowing on its own to a growth rate that will neither ignite
inflation nor significantly increase unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists think labor markets are still so tight, with
unemployment at 4.5 percent, that wages will begin rising, perhaps
squeezing profits and spurring companies to try to raise prices. As
a result, Greenspan and the Fed will continue to look closely for
signs of incipient inflation, and are already dissecting the recent
decline in corporate earnings growth to see if it portends higher
labor costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the market's tumble will also force Greenspan to look for
signs of declining demand, especially in the form of consumers
reining in their spending or the long boom in housing beginning to
peter out. Although economists argue about the magnitude, they
agree that some portion of robust consumer spending over the past
several years has derived from the feeling of affluence conferred
by the rising stock market. The speed and magnitude with which the
same phenomenon might go into reverse remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp enough decline could stall the economy or even tilt it
into recession, forcing the Fed to cut rates to stimulate demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to want to see a sustained downward move in
consumer confidence and then in spending itself before they move,''
said M. Carey Leahy, an economist at High Frequency Economics.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Economic indicators in recent days have done little to clarify
the outlook. The National Association of Purchasing Management
reported today that its survey of industrial sector business
conditions in August found a slight increase in activity. But the
survey's new orders component, which gives some indication of
future activity, declined for the fourth time in six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new orders series is probably very high on Greenspan's
radar screen at the present,'' said David Orr, an economist at
First Union Capital Markets Group. ``It is moving toward an ease,
but based on past evidence is not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Conference Board, a business research organization, said
today that its index of indicators intended to predict the future
strength of the economy rose 0.4 percent in July, reversing a
two-month decline. The results were somewhat skewed by the strike
against General Motors and its settlement, but appeared to indicate
a gradual economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the economy seems healthy, but growth prospects
are not as strong as in the early part of 1998,'' said Michael
Boldin, the board's director of business cycle research.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed will also keep a close eye on the health and stability
of the banking system and the securities industry, especially if
the stock market resumes its decline after today's rebound.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike 1987, when banks were already suffering from a real
estate bust and heavy losses on loans to developing nations, or in
1982, when the failure of a small bank in Oklahoma was rocking
major financial institutions like Continental Illinois in Chicago,
the American financial system today is very healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Short of a calamitous meltdown in the markets, the financial
system appears unlikely to need any action by the Fed to provide
cash to keep payments and settlements proceeding on an orderly
basis because most institutions have plenty of capital -- their
cushion against losses -- and the robust expansion of the money
supply this year means there is plenty of liquidity in the system.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the domestic economy holds up reasonably well and the
market decline does not turn into a crash, Greenspan will still
have to be sensitive to any further erosion in the global economic
climate, since the United States will ultimately be affected to
some degree by what is happening among its trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   Fed officials have been tracking Latin America particularly
closely in recent days to track how seriously the region becomes
infected by the global credit squeeze that followed Russia's debt
default and devaluation. Mexico and the big nations of South
America account for almost 20 percent of American exports.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's financial crisis in 1994 led to a bailout by the
Clinton Administration over objections from Congress. The 1982
crisis across Latin America was a key factor in the decision by the
Fed under Paul Volcker, then the central bank's chairman, to shift
its sights from squelching inflation to stimulating the economy at
home and abroad by cutting rates.
</P>
<P>
   But Lyle Gramley, who was a Fed governor from 1980 to 1985, said
that the Fed reduced rates in 1982 largely because the domestic
economy had remained mired in recession. But he said 1982 should
not be seen a precedent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international considerations affected the decision, but
there wasn't at that point any conflict at all between the
international and domestic considerations,'' Gramley said. ``Today
the situation is very different. If we ask whether we're really
sure that developments in the world economy have had an effect on
economic growth in the United States, the answer is we can't be
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy said that a rate cut by the Fed could even have negative
effects on the global crisis. Reducing rates in the United States,
he said, might ease the pressure on other countries, especially
Japan, to take the painful steps needed to shore up their
economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Domestic demand is strong,'' Levy said, ticking off reasons
why the Fed should not ease immediately. ``Labor markets are tight.
The U.S. banking system has more than enough liquidity and is well
capitalized. And easing would not help Russia and would undermine
U.S. efforts to lead Japan to reform.''

SHORT SELLERS CELEBRATING  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By REED ABELSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not everyone is lamenting the stock market's steep
selloff. While many investors are still licking their wounds, even
after Tuesday's rally, some are celebrating. They may have stayed
on the sidelines with cash, for example, immune to the damage in
the last few weeks, or made astute bets in the Treasury market and
racked up some gains.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those with the widest grins are most likely those people
who bet on a market downturn, selling stocks short by borrowing
shares that they sell and hope to replace with cheaper shares as
stock prices decline. The short sellers are the ultimate bears,
cheering any decline in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making money in quite a few places,'' said David Tice,
the manager of the Prudent Bear Fund, a mutual fund that
specializes in shorting stocks. Prudent Bear posted a gain of about
30 percent in August. Among the areas that Tice has found most
profitable for short sales are the heavily damaged stocks in
technology and banking.
</P>
<P>
   Most short sellers seem to be making out handsomely. According
to Michael Long, the principal of Rockbridge Research, a Charlotte,
N.C., firm that specializes in analyzing short selling trends, the
short sellers he follows are up about 25 percent to 30 percent so
far this year.
</P>
<P>
   These investors ``have have done phenomenally well, based on the
current they are swimming in,'' said Long, who estimates that short
sellers as a group earned an average return of about 12 percent
last year, even though the overall stock market was then surging.
</P>
<P>
   And even if their victory is short-lived, and stocks resume
their upward march, the short sellers say that the market drop has
demonstrated that their strategy offers some protection to
investors when the markets turn ugly. ``Short selling is a better
way to reduce risk than most other strategies,'' argued James
Chanos, a long-time short seller who is president of Kynikos
Associates, a money management firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The short sellers have had no trouble finding opportunities in
recent weeks. Just like investors in a roaring bull market, who can
buy nearly any stock and make money, these investors have found
themselves in a market environment where stocks of nearly every
type have gone down.
</P>
<P>
   Whether their strategies will continue to make money is
anybody's guess, since they depend on weakness in stock prices.
Tice, for one, believes the stock market could drop much further.
``We think this is going to be the big one,'' he said. `` We think
we have broken the back of sentiment.'' He believes global
deflationary forces will severely depress the earnings of American
companies, sending stocks down much more.
</P>
<P>
   Chanos, on the other hand, is agnostic on the outlook for the
stock market. While the United States seems to be enjoying a strong
economy, which would be positive for stocks, investors could refuse
to come to the stock market's rescue and the country could slide
into a recession. If that happens, ``all bets are off,'' he said.
``The downside is enormous.''

NORTHWEST STRIKE COULD MEAN RISKY FLYING AFTER LABOR DAY
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Minn., Mich., Ill.) (fb) 
By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pilots' strike at Northwest Airlines so far has not caused
tremendous disruption for business travelers, since many carriers
are temporarily increasing service at Northwest's primary hubs at
Wayne County Metropolitan Airport in Detroit and Minneapolis/St.
Paul International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   However, such flying can be more expensive than usual, say some
travel agency officials, who believe the other airlines are
reducing availability of less expensive fares on routes where they
normally compete with Northwest, as demand for seats currently
often exceeds supply.
</P>
<P>
   And although disruptions for travelers have been minimal so far,
industry officials predict they could become quite severe if the
strike extends into the two weeks after Labor Day, when business
travel normally picks up.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Faulkner, a Northwest spokesman, said the airline was trying
to reschedule passengers on other carriers. He said this had been
accomplished for 70 percent of Northwest's passengers so far.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the loss of Northwest's service, American
Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines and United Airlines
have increased the frequency of flights or started using larger
planes from their main hub cities to either Minneapolis or Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kiwi International Airlines on Monday began new
service between Newark International Airport and Detroit. Also
increasing service out of Minneapolis is Sun Country Airlines, a
privately held charter carrier whose fares are priced at least
one-third lower than those of scheduled carriers, according to the
airline. Sun Country has already increased its service between
Minneapolis and O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and will
increase flights between Detroit and Kennedy International Airport
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Northwest's competitors on its Asian routes,
including Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific, said they did not need
to add new flights or increase the size of their aircraft to
accommodate Northwest's passengers, since traffic to Asia has been
depressed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the major U.S. airlines said they were not raising
fares on routes where they compete with Northwest, it appears that
they are attempting to charge travelers the highest prices they
offer. Unlike other big carriers _ which have been making full
coach fares nonrefundable to avoid strike-related double booking _
United Airlines is offering a fully refundable coach fare that is
approximately $50 higher than the normal full coach fare. The
carrier is also offering a less expensive nonrefundable full coach
fare. United officials conceded that they were making more of the
refundable fares _ which were also sold before the Northwest strike
_ available than usual.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind, when you have supply and
demand economics, and there's more demand than supply, the airlines
are trying to raise their yields,'' said Travis Tanner, president
of Carlson Wagonlit Travel, a major corporate travel company.
''They're trying to take as much revenue on the plane as they can,
and small travel agents and individual travelers are finding it
impossible to get discounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, corporate travel agencies have scrambled to help
clients stranded by the Northwest strike. Early last month,
American Express, &UR;  &LR; Carlson Wagonlit and Rosenbluth International
started making alternate travel plans for customers in the event of
a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Although arranging alternative transportation has so far not
been a big problem for most business travelers, the strike has
inconvenienced many in small, often annoying ways. Tom Polski, the
Minneapolis-based vice president of public relations and
communications for Carlson Hospitality Worldwide, was originally
scheduled to fly on Northwest to Brussels last night for a meeting.
Instead, he rescheduled the meeting and was to fly tonight on
Delta, via Atlanta. Polski said he felt ``fortunate'' that he was
able to rearrange his plans relatively easily.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Gilles, a Detroit-based marketing specialist for Genentech,
Inc., was to fly to San Francisco on Monday on American, rather
than on Northwest, her carrier of choice. She would have preferred
flying on United _ in whose frequent-flyer program she
participates, along with Northwest's _ but United's schedule did
not fit her needs. She said she also had a layover in Chicago that
made her trip three hours longer than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials predicted that prospects for business travelers
could be far gloomier after the Labor Day holiday if the strike
continues. Melissa Abernathy, a spokeswoman for American Express,
said she expected a ``spike'' in business travel immediately after
the holiday, while Tanner of Carlson Wagonlit predicted even
greater disruption the following week, should the strike last that
long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next week will be softer because it will be a four-day week,''
he said. ``The problem will come when people start trying to book
for the following week.'' &QL;

SINN FEIN CALLS VIOLENCE `A THING OF THE PAST' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Gerry Adams said Tuesday that his
party, Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army,
now considered violence in Northern Ireland to be ``a thing of the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement promptly welcomed by the British and Irish
governments and timed to precede President Clinton's here Thursday,
Adams said, ``Sinn Fein believe the violence we have seen must be
for all of us now a thing of the past, over, done with and gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has been actively engaged in the Northern Ireland
peace settlement, told guests at a private dinner in Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., on Friday night that he had had an hour's
telephone conversation with Adams from his vacation retreat about
the party's need to convince doubters of its peaceful intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' statement, issued by the party's press center in Belfast,
appeared to be the Republican group's response to demands that it
declare that ``the war is over'' without using the precise words
urged upon it by its political opponents. It was left to an ally,
John Hume, leader of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and
Labor Party, to connect the dots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I particularly welcome the fact that Sinn Fein have underlined
their total commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic
methods,'' Hume said, ``stating in other words that as far as the
Republican movement is concerned, the so-called war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the process created by the April 10 peace
settlement is the convening of the new Northern Ireland Assembly on
Sept. 14 and the naming of members of the 10-person executive that
will run it. Sinn Fein is entitled to at least one of the
positions, and pressure has been rising on its military affiliate,
the IRA, to say its ``war'' is ended and to begin dismantling of
its arsenal. Protestant politicians are threatening to contest Sinn
Fein's taking up of its ministerial positions unless it meets the
two conditions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The IRA has maintained a cease-fire for 14 months and in a rare
public statement in Dublin on Monday condemned the bombing in Omagh
two weeks ago by a renegade republican group called the Real IRA
that killed 28 people.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said nothing Tuesday altering the IRA's refusal thus far
to say it will turn in arms, and opponents seized on that to
dismiss the statement's value. Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the
hard-line Protestant Democratic Unionists, said, ``All it suggests
is at best a desire for violence to end subject to them getting
their way and shouldn't be considered as being an advance.''
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists and first minister
of the new legislature, gave the statement a cautious welcome, but
added: ``Carefully crafted words are not enough. The people of
Northern Ireland will now judge Sinn Fein on their actions over the
coming days. An end to the war means the weapons of terrorism must
be destroyed and all forms of paramilitary violence must cease for
good.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is to
join Clinton in Belfast on Thursday, called the statement
``significant and welcome'' and said, ``It confirms the prime
minister in his view that Sinn Fein deserve to be taken seriously
in their commitment to exclusively peaceful means.''

SARATOGA'S TOP JOCKEY IS HURT IN A FALL; WON'T RIDE FOR 3 MONTHS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.Y., Florida) (fb) 
By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Mike Smith, the leading rider at
Saratoga this summer and the regular jockey on the star colt
Coronado's Quest, fractured two vertebrae in his upper back in a
spill he took on Monday. He will not ride for three or four months.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old jockey remained in the Albany Medical Center on
Tuesday. He was transferred there Monday night from Saratoga
Hospital, and was resting comfortably with no neurological damage,
according to his doctors. But Dr. Allen Carl, an orthopedic surgeon
and specialist in spinal injuries, reported that Smith would be
kept in a body cast for two months and would not be able to resume
normal activity for at least three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm eager to get back to racing as soon as medically
possible,'' Smith said today from his hospital bed. ``I'm going to
be out for a little while, but I'll be back. That's my goal, to
come back strong or even stronger than before.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith won the $750,000 Travers Stakes aboard Coronado's Quest on
Saturday in a thrilling three-horse finish at Saratoga Race Course.
But two days later, about 200 yards after the start of an allowance
race on the grass, he was flipped into the hedges during some
bumping in traffic. ``One minute, you're on top of the world,'' he
reflected, ``and the next, you're flat on your back. But I thank
the Lord that I didn't sever my spinal cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl, a professor of surgery at the medical center, said Smith
would be fitted for a body cast in the next day or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that,'' he said, ``Mike is going to be in the cast for
about two months. He could be out of the hospital by the weekend,
but he won't ride again for three or four months.''
</P>
<P>
   The injury was the second major setback for Smith this year, his
17th as a professional jockey, although neither injury was caused
by Coronado's Quest, a rambunctious 3-year-old colt who usually
kicked and bucked when being saddled and twice last winter in
Florida threw his rider off his back.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was riding in a race on the undercard for the Florida
Derby last March 14 at Gulfstream Park when he was spilled and
dislocated his collarbone. He was replaced for the main event that
day by Robbie Davis, who rode Coronado's Quest to a third-place
finish. One month later, back north at Aqueduct in New York, the
colt seemed to have matured and, with Davis again in the saddle,
won the Wood Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   However, Shug McGaughey, his trainer, decided not to take any
chances with his behavioral uncertainties in the Triple Crown. And
Coronado's Quest reeled off a series of impressive stakes victories
with Smith once more on his back, winning the Riva Ridge and the
Dwyer at Belmont Park, the $1 million Haskell Invitational at
Monmouth Park and the Travers at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   But when he resumes his campaign for the 3-year-old championship
next month and runs in the Breeders' Cup on Nov. 7, he will clearly
not have Smith as his jockey. McGaughey will presumably stay with
Davis, the only other rider the colt has known.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith lives in the high-risk business of riding
thousand-pound race horses in tight quarters, he has been
relatively free of serious injuries. In 1982, he broke his
collarbone at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, but he began riding in New
York in 1989 and quickly became one of the elite jockeys. In 1994,
he was the leading rider at Gulfstream Park, Keeneland and Belmont
Park. And he won two Eclipse Awards in a row as the country's
outstanding jockey.  &QL;

PLAY OF OFFENSIVE LINE KEY TO GIANTS' SUCCESS AGAINST REDSKINS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is a simple difference of opinion. The members of the New
York Giants' offensive line scoff at talk of their preseason
problems, promising that they will be ready when the regular season
begins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But Giants coach Jim Fassel, who believes that you play the way
you practice, does not expect a sudden improvement just because the
team has arrived at the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most sensible assessment came from right guard Ron
Stone, who seemed surprised that anyone _ Fassel included _ would
question the line's ability. ``I can answer these questions after
Sunday,'' he said calmly.
</P>
<P>
   The season opener at Giants Stadium against the Washington
Redskins may indeed answer the questions concerning the line's
ability to provide holes for the running backs, as well as the
backs' ability to find their way through them.
</P>
<P>
   The new and improved Redskins have added the tackles Dana
Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson in an attempt to bring talent and
bulk to the center of their defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   An impressive performance Sunday may prove players like Stone
and left tackle Roman Oben to be correct, but the line's
performance in preseason has clearly given Fassel a cause for
concern. The group had its moments, playing well for a half against
the Jets. But fullback Charles Way sprained his ankle in that game,
and without him, Tiki Barber, Gary Brown and Tyrone Wheatley could
not pick up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   In the final exhibition game against the Baltimore Ravens, the
starting line _ the same quintet that played together in the final
11 games of last season _ was in place for slightly more than a
quarter. During that time the Giants ran the ball five times and
gained only 7 yards.
</P>
<P>
   After that game, Fassel was critical of the line and
understandably worried about its depth, prompting the Giants to
sign Lonnie Palelei, a Jets castoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't assume everything's going to fall into place,'' Fassel
said after Monday's practice. ``It'll only fall into place if we
make it fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the offensive line, he said: ``When they get cranked
up and ready to go, they can come off the ball and block people.
When they don't, if we're not in sync and coming off the ball with
our pads low, we look pretty ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Danny Kanell, who escaped the preseason with having
been sacked only twice, said, ``Coach Fassel held up a sheet from
last year's schedule and said, `Look at what happened when we broke
100 yards rushing _ 9-2-1 _ and look at what happened when we
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were 1-3 in those other games.
</P>
<P>
   Stone said: ``If this is what the coach thought, I guess we've
got to fix it and turn it up. We've got to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants finished last season with the line of Oben and Stone,
right tackle Scott Gragg, center Lance Scott and left guard Greg
Bishop blending to form a potent unit. The team rushed for more
than 100 yards in nine of its last 10 games, and missed by only 1
yard against Tampa Bay in the other game. But Fassel stressed to
his team this week that he is seeking consistency as well as
quality, and consistency has been lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We don't want to run for 150 yards in one game and
65 in the next game, then 200 and then 40,''' Oben said. ``It's
nothing to worry about. It's just having to focus on what's going
to make us a better running team. You can't take those criticisms
in a negative way because it's all for the improvement of our team.
As an offensive lineman, you want to have a good, solid running
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the starters will be playing the whole game. In some games
it takes a couple of series to get it going, and if you're only
going to play a couple of series, it's going to be a lot harder.
Now it's our best 11 against their best 11 for the whole game.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to Fassel's concern may be the fact that the
Redskins' defense has improved significantly. Last season the
Giants rushed for 157 and 130 yards in two games against
Washington. With Stubblefield and Wilkinson acquired at a cost of
$57.4 million, including $13 million in signing bonuses, the weak
middle that ranked the Redskins 28th in rushing defense last season
is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my eye on it when they started signing those guys,''
Kanell said. ``I mean, they're going to be a tough team. You look
at what they did defensively against the pass and they struggled
against the rush. Now they've pretty much solved that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone said: ``They've upgraded. It's big on big. It's a good
test for our offense, period. We'll simplify things more, get our
game plan in and we have to get after it.''

SEATTLE TIMES BUYS GUY GANNETT ASSETS IN MAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Seattle Times Co. Tuesday said it bought newspapers,
including the respected Portland Press Herald in Maine, from Guy
Gannett Communications in a deal officials said was forged in part
on cultural and family ties between the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is thrilled with this deal,'' said Tim O'Meara,
spokesman for Guy Gannett. ``Of all the companies in the newspaper
business, the Seattle Times is one most like our company in the
sense of independence, of family ownership, and commitment to the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy Gannett officials reluctantly put the company's holdings on
the block in April, saying it was forced to sell because of terms
laid out in the family trust that controls the company.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at Guy Gannett newspapers worried at the time that any
company coming in would likely slash newsroom costs, sacrificing
coverage for a better bottom line. Seattle Times Co. publisher
Frank Blethen Tuesday said his company doesn't intend cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see any major, dramatic changes,'' he said. ``We
practice a pretty aggressive brand of independent journalism, and
our whole idea is to raise the bar journalistically. We have to run
a business and get a return, but one of our key phrases is that we
make money to print newspapers, not the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   Blethen said the two companies began negotiating earlier this
year after he made a number of ``family pilgrimages'' to Maine and
discovered likenesses to the geography and culture of the Pacific
Northwest. The Blethen family, which controls the Seattle Times,
originated in Maine before moving west.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a real emotional connection,'' he said. ``We
discovered many similarities.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Seattle Times Co. and Guy Gannett are fourth-generation,
family-owned enterprises, an increasing rarity in newspaper
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders said Guy Gannett, which is not related to Gannett Co.,
the nation's largest newspaper chain, sought out the Seattle Times
partly because of its family ownership and because it feared being
taken over by more ruthless bidders. Terms of the deal were not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, expected to be completed in October, the Seattle
Times also acquired the Maine Sunday Telegram in Portland, the
Kennebec Journal of Augusta, the Morning Sentinal of Waterville,
and the weekly Coastal Journal in Bath. In addition, it purchased
Guy Gannett's Internet and direct marketing businesses along with
services that provide telephone callers with weather forecasts,
stock quotes, and news.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times is the largest newspaper in Washington with a
Sunday circulation of 503,000 and is the winner of seven Pulitzer
Prizes. Its parent company also owns the Yakima Herald-Republic and
the Walla-Walla Union-Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland Press Herald has a circulation of 72,000.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Gannett's TV holdings, which include seven
network-affiliated stations in six states, are still up for sale,
company officials said.

CHRYSLER, TOYOTA REPORT RECORD SALES FOR AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic on auto makers' August sales is being sent to NYT
photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sales of Chrysler cars and trucks rose 3.5 percent in August,
setting a new record for the month, though they were off from the
blistering pace of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler Corp. sold 186,469 cars and trucks in August, up
from 180,131 vehicles in August 1997. The previous August record
was set in 1996, when the auto maker sold 186,306 vehicles. This
spring, Chrysler had been selling more than 200,000 vehicles a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Car sales showed the largest increase, up 17 percent, to 56,843
vehicles. The Chrysler Cirrus, Dodge Stratus and Plymouth Breeze,
which carry a $1,500 rebate for 1998 models, had double-digit sales
increases. The new Chrysler 300M and LHS, introduced last spring,
combined with the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid, introduced
last fall and slow to take off, were up 32 percent; they carried no
incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks account for the bulk of Chrysler's sales, but they were
off 1 percent at 129,626 vehicles, largely because mini-van sales
fell 22 percent. Chrysler mini-van owners participated heavily in
last spring's promotion offering loyal owners special incentives,
said Jamie Jameson, Chrysler's executive director for sales and
marketing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Chrysler's sport utility vehicles declined because Jeep
Grand Cherokees, redesigned for the 1999 model year, are being
produced slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Other auto manufacturers also reported strong, and, in some
cases, record sales.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota Motor Corp. reported its best August ever. Car and
truck sales for its Toyota and Lexus brands totaled 130,814
vehicles, up 10.9 percent from August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Toyota division had sales of 113,865, up 6.5 percent from
last August, for the fourth-consecutive month of 100,000-plus
sales. Lexus outsold Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Cadillac and Lincoln in
July to become the best-selling luxury brand in the United States
for the first time in its nine-year history. It had record sales of
16,949 cars and sport utility vehicles, up 52.5 percent from August
of last year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first eight months of this year, 100,000 Lexus vehicles
were sold, more than all of 1997, when sales hit a record 97,593
vehicles. Lexus' sales strength is coming from its best-selling
model, the new RX 300, and the LX 470. The two sport utility
vehicles represent 40 percent of total Lexus sales.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru of America announced August sales were its best since
1989. Subaru sales totaled 14,068, up 9.3 percent from August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda reported its best sales month since March 1995. Sales of
Mazda cars and trucks totaled 30,761 vehicles, up 37 percent from a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Kia Motors America reported sales of 8,016 cars and sport
utility vehicles, up 26.8 percent from year-earlier levels.
</P>
<P>
   Isuzu sales rose 5.7 percent, to 9,030 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   American Honda reported its second-best month ever, though they
were lower than a year earlier. Sales of Honda and Acura brand cars
and trucks totaled 97,441 vehicles in August, a decline from 3.2
percent last August. The company said low inventories held sales
below last year's levels.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi sales fell 9.6 percent, to 18,160 cars and trucks,
though sales of its largest volume vehicle, the midsize Galant,
redesigned for 1999 and which arrived in showrooms in August,
increased 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Land Rover reported August sales of 1,714, down 27.3 percent
from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Other auto makers, including the Ford Motor Co., and the General
Motors Corp., report sales later this week.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the roller-coaster stock market has had no impact on car
and truck sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes a deep continuing dive like it did in 1987, there
might be an impact,'' Jameson of Chrysler said. ``If it bounces
back and recovers most of its fall _ or a good percentage of it _
we don't think there will be long-term impact at all.''

AS ANGOLA HELPS STABILIZE CONGO, PEACE SEEMS ELUSIVE AT HOME
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Even as Angolan troops are busy propping up the
neighboring government of Congo, prospects for peace in Angola seem
to be diminishing.
</P>
<P>
   In a huge blow to the country's fragile peace process, Angola's
ruling party on Monday put the country's government of national
unity on hold. Saying that the rebel party, UNITA, had failed to
meet its peace-treaty obligations, the government suspended all
representatives of the former rebel movement from Parliament. It
also suspended the four UNITA cabinet ministers and 11 vice
ministers.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the government urged the people to stay ``calm,
vigilant and to not act in a manner contrary to the spirit of
national reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts said they feared the country was sliding into
an undeclared war. In recent weeks the government has reported
increasing clashes in the countryside, including a battle in the
northern province of Malange that apparently left 200 dead.
</P>
<P>
   The creation of the government of national unity last year was
in many ways the linchpin of the peace process, which has dragged
on for far longer and cost far more than anyone expected. The
United Nations has spent more than $1 billion on peacekeeping in
this ravaged _ if oil- and diamond-rich _ country.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is the gloves coming off again,'' said
Richard Cornwell, a security analyst in South Africa with the
Institute for Security Studies. ``It all looks very dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than 20 years of civil war that left most roads
cratered, most industries destroyed and millions dead, Angola has
been hovering somewhere between peace and war for more than three
years.
</P>
<P>
   At stages, both the government _ headed by President Jose dos
Santos _ and UNITA, the Portuguese acronym for the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola, have been faulted for foot
dragging on the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, international observers have held UNITA
responsible for delaying the final stages of the 1994 accord, the
Lusaka Protocol, and the United Nations has imposed sanctions
including travel restrictions on UNITA leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, UNITA issued declarations that lashed out at the
United States, Russia and Portugal, the three countries that had
official ``observer'' status in the peace process. The rebels said
they would no longer deal with those countries, because they had
disqualified themselves ``by not observing the criteria of
neutrality and balance in their activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In suspending the unity government, dos Santos' party said
recent clashes in the countryside had proved that UNITA had failed
to disarm. UNITA has claimed that it no longer has any kind of
army. But diplomats routinely estimate that it still has more than
30,000 well-trained and well-armed guerrilla fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, there appeared to be little left to do to
complete the Lusaka Protocol. The government of National Unity had
been formed, most of the districts had been turned over to
government officials for administration, and thousand of UNITA
soldiers had been demobilized.
</P>
<P>
   But the accomplishments were more paper victories than real
ones. Clashes continued throughout the country, and as the time
came for UNITA to give up its pivotal strongholds, the rebel
leaders balked. UNITA officials said the newly installed government
administrations were harassing and even killing its supporters
throughout the country. In some cases, that was true, diplomats
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the government had set Monday as a deadline for
Unita to turn over all territory. That did not occur.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Monday, the government said recent clashes had
proved that UNITA had ``violated the constitution of Angola, the
law of political parties and the Lusaka Protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they believed that the two sides were gearing
up for more sustained clashes and that even the government
excursions into Congo were really more a question of its wanting to
flush out UNITA rebels, who are holed up on the Congo side of the
border, than support for the government of Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   A return to open warfare could mean years more of fighting,
analysts said. Neither side is deemed to have the military power to
annihilate the other. Although there are some well-trained and
well-equipped regiments in the Angolan Army, many soldiers are
conscripts who have not been properly trained or paid.
</P>
<P>
   And the government faces the difficulty of fighting an elusive
guerrilla force.
</P>
<P>
   Angola won its independence from Portugal in 1975 and
immediately plunged into a civil war, fueled by Cold War interests.
On one side was dos Santos' party, the Marxist Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola, supported by Soviet and Cuban troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side was Jonas Savimbi's UNITA party, part
anti-Communist movement and part personality cult, supported by the
United States and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A truce was achieved in 1992, and elections were held. But when
dos Santos won, Savimbi returned to war. In 1994, facing likely
defeat, he agreed to the Lusaka Protocol.
</P>
<P>
   The fiery Savimbi has never been satisfied with what he agreed
to, analysts said, and he has done his best to force new talks that
would increase his power.

PGE TO BUILD GAS-FIRED POWER PLANT IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ PG&AMP;E Corp. Tuesday said it plans to construct a
475-megawatt gas-fired power plant on the site of its 1,576-
megawatt Brayton Point generating facility in Somerset, the largest
non-nuclear power plant in New England _ with the added reputation
as Massachusetts' single biggest air polluter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the San Francisco-based company said it has no
immediate plans to shut down any of the three coal-burning
generators or the fourth oil-fired generator at Brayton Point after
construction of the new $300 million gas plant is completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will look at all our plants, but we are not making any
commitments at this time,'' said Joseph P. Kearney, PG&AMP;E senior
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental and consumer watchdog groups such as Masspirg
maintain the smokestacks at the sprawling Brayton Point facility
spew out enough soot and smog to account for 20 percent of the air
pollution in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brayton Point is so old it deserves to be put in a musuem, so
if they build a new plant that reduces sulfur dioxide and nitrous
oxide and don't shut the aging polluting plant it will replace, it
will mean nothing to the people who breathe the air downwind,''
said Robert Sargent, Masspirg energy program director.
</P>
<P>
   And the Conservation Law Foundation, which praised PG&AMP;E for its
plans to build a new gas-fired plant on the 225-acre Somerset site,
said PG&AMP;E should also reduce its reliance on the coal-burning
plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're extremely disappointed that they will not shut down
Brayton Point after building their new plant,'' said Richard
Kennelly, a staff attorney at Boston-based CLF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, New York-based Sithe Energies Inc. announced plans
in mid-July to construct a 1,500 megawatt gas-fired facility in
Everett, the site of its 50-year-old Mystic Power plant.
</P>
<P>
   But Sithe said its goal is to mothball three of the four older
oil-fired generators for 11 months of the year once the new plant
is operational.
</P>
<P>
   The older units of the former Boston Edison plant would operate
just 30 days during the summer to meet peak electricity demand.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, PG&AMP;E's Kearney acknowledged the local environmental
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a US Public Interest Research Group report that ranked
Brayton Point 83rd on a national list of the 100 worst polluting
plant with excessive sulfur dioxide emission _ the source of soot,
a respiratory irritant that can cause premature death.
</P>
<P>
   Kearney said PG&AMP;E hopes gain state and federal approvals for the
new plant in the next 18 months, and then take another 18 to 24
months to construct the plant.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's goal is to have the gas-fired plant
operational in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E recently began construction on a 360-megawatt electric
generating plant in Charlton.
</P>
<P>
   Brayton Point, Kearney said, is one of the cornerstones of the
company's entry into the New England electric power generation
market.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday PG&AMP;E formally acquired the Somerset facility along with
two other fossil-fuel plants in Massachusetts and Rhode Island and
15 hydroelectric plants in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and
Vermont, all from New England Electric System, for nearly $1.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The relatively high price it received for the power plants has
prompted NEES to announce a reduction in monthly electric bills by
an additional eight percent for its 950,000 customers, over the
current 10 percent rate cut.

DESPITE WALL STREET'S PROBLEMS, MADISON AVENUE IS UPBEAT ON
CONSUMERS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Advertisers, agencies and the media are warily
optimistic that the free-spending ways of American consumers, which
have fueled more than three years of solid growth on Madison
Avenue, will survive the wild gyrations on Wall Street relatively
intact.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising industry is notoriously sensitive to the whims
of public mood because how people feel about themselves so often
depends on how they feel about the economy. If shoppers are so
rattled by a plunge in stock market prices that a national buyers'
strike ensues in supermarkets, car showrooms and department stores,
marketers may sharply pare ad spending. That would wound agencies,
which were hard hit during the recession in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Executives relaxed Monday when the Dow Jones industrial average
roared back, recovering part of the decline that had left the
closely followed index, with apologies to George Bush, a thousand
points lighter. Though the coming weeks may yet bring another
tumble, they said they still believed that the advertising picture
remained positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not all that surprised by the uncertainty, insecurity and
turmoil,'' said Peter A. Georgescu, chairman and chief executive at
Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York, ``but I have yet to be persuaded
that we're looking at something fundamentally calamitous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People still have their jobs,'' said Georgescu, whose agency
creates campaigns for giant advertisers like Citicorp, the
Colgate-Palmolive Co., the Ford Motor Co. and the Philip Morris
Companies. ``I don't think they will go deep into bunkers and pull
the blankets over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   And the economic uncertainties, he added, may spur marketers
``to place more emphasis on pushing the bottom line the
old-fashioned way, by selling more stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That gives agencies a wonderful opportunity as well as a
serious challenge: to make something concrete happen in the
marketplace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene P. Beard, vice chairman for finance and operations at the
Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, echoed Georgescu.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a relative basis, we should be OK,'' he said of
Interpublic, which owns agencies like Ammirati Puris Lintas, Lowe
Group and McCann-Erickson World Group, ``because I think we've been
prudent enough to make sure we haven't stepped off the horizon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two or three meetings in the last month,'' Beard said,
``to make sure that we stayed very, very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make your numbers, watch your cash flow,
maintain your strong balance sheet and concentrate on what you're
doing for clients and shareholders,'' he added. ``If you do that, I
think you have an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading forecaster of Madison Avenue also predicted little
fallout despite the Dow Jones falloff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that doom and gloom, and uncertainty, are
not good things,'' said Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and
forecasting director at McCann-Erickson USA, a unit of
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising in New York. ``But I don't
think this will net out to be much of a factor in ad spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Coen forecast in June that marketers would spend a record $200.3
billion to advertise this year in the United States, up 6.8 percent
from $187.5 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be watching closely,'' he said, ``but I'm not making any
significant modification yet in my figures.''
</P>
<P>
   Two industry analysts offered upbeat assessments of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer confidence has proven to be a very strong leading
indicator of ad spending,'' said William Bird, who follows the
advertising and publishing industries for the Salomon Smith Barney
unit of Travelers Group in New York, ``and I don't see anything
that would alarm me at this early juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   The multinational advertisers that hire such large agency
companies as Y.&AMP; R., Interpublic, Omnicom Group and WPP Group PLC
``are spending at very healthy levels to maintain top-line
growth,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be unhappy people on Wall Street,'' he said, ``but
the Coca-Colas are still focused on unit growth and driving that
unit growth through advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan J. Gottesman, managing director at West End
Communications/Consulting in New York, played down the
preoccupation with Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's talk about the real America,'' he said, which ``is not
all that affected by this. People are still working. They're not
getting fired or laid off. And more people are making more money.
If some yuppie can't buy a house in the Hamptons, it won't have any
impact on the advertising business.''
</P>
<P>
   There were, of course, some cautionary notes amid the generally
sanguine mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market psychology affects spending,'' said David Verklin,
chief executive at Carat North America in New York, a media
services unit of Aegis Group PLC, ``and clients are inherently
conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing left up for grabs is the fourth quarter,'' he
added, ``which accounts for at least 33 percent of annual spending.
Everyone will make decisions next week and the week after about the
fourth-quarter spot TV and radio markets. Will they want to spend
that extra $5 million to add a schedule between Thanksgiving and
Christmas?''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Whitehead, chief executive for North America at Bates
Worldwide in New York, part of Cordiant Communications Group PLC,
recalled a two-week trip from which he just returned, visiting
dealers who sell cars for a client, Hyundai Motor America, along
with more expensive marques in sibling showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dealers told me they could not keep the BMW's and
Mercedeses and Porsches in stock,'' Whitehead said. ``Now the
question will be whether consumers sustain that, or keep that money
in their pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``the economy is pretty damn strong,'' he added, ``and
this is a great opportunity for advertisers to be aggressive and
invest to build brand equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Media executives said they perceived no advertiser reticence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People's fourth quarter looks very strong,'' said Ann S.
Moore, president at People magazine in New York, published by the
Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc., ``and we see no impact at this
point'' from the stock market's turbulent ride.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Goodman, president for CNN Sales and Marketing in New
York, who oversees cable networks also owned by Time Warner, said:
``It has been exceptionally calm. We had no cancellations. In fact,
we ended up with two mutual fund companies saying `Get me on the
air.'''
</P>
<P>
   At TV Guide magazine, said Richard G. Porter, senior vice
president and publisher in New York, ``so far it's business as
usual.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested with a chuckle that there could be a silver lining
in Wall Street's woes for TV Guide, which the News Corp. is selling
to United Video Satellite Group: If consumers curtail spending by
forgoing restaurant meals and movies, they may stay home to _ yes,
watch more television.

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES THREATEN CLINTON'S LAST HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: May take analysis tag.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the moment he emerged on the national scene,
Bill Clinton's destiny _ political and personal _ has been tied to
the economy. It was the economy that brought him to the White
House. It was the economy that sustained him through perilous
times. And now the uncertainties racing through the economy are
prompting uncertainties to run through politics.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this run of financial jitters, brought home by the last
two days of seismic market swings, will prove that the president's
popularity truly defies gravity. But the grave worry at the White
House is that these worries may undermine the president's position
as he awaits a report by independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr and
possible impeachment hearings and proceedings in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The president's political fortunes will not be determined by the
gyrations in the stock market in the next day or two, though
business fortunes surely will be made or lost. But the president
still faces danger if the volatility on Wall Street continues, for
it threatens not only the savings and retirement accounts of
American workers but also the sense of security Americans feel
about their country and its leadership.
</P>
<P>
   This week economic Washington felt the breath of the bear, but,
with the return of the Senate to town, political Washington felt
the cool breath of summer's end, carrying with it the sure
knowledge that an important reckoning is near, and now unavoidable.
All summer long Congress and commentators have awaited the
independent counsel's report. Soon, to choose a seasonal metaphor,
it will make landfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is the background music,'' said Robert E. Litan,
an economist at the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.
``It's possible that the background music will be cacophonous, and
cacophony and uncertainty are not good for the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But right now it isn't only the stock market that is in tumult,
with spectacular boom following an even more spectacular bust.
Russia is in upheaval, its peril underlined by this week's summit
involving two hobbled presidents. And North Korea has launched a
missile over Japanese airspace. And the next terrorist incident may
be only a newscast away.
</P>
<P>
   Together these disparate events, separated by thousands of
miles, may not add up to anything. But they underline a new unease
in the American outlook _ in national affairs, in world events and,
where it could hurt most, in people's wallets.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the new Era of Uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   If domestic tranquility is a political force _ and the high
approval ratings of the embattled president suggest that it is _
then surely uncertainty is a force, too, one that affects not only
the national economy but also the national psychology.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is betting that the economic doubts could
strengthen the president's hand. ``When the Dow bounces and the
markets have a flu is not a good time to play political games,''
said Ann F. Lewis, the White House director of communications.
``There's a lot more at stake here than partisan politics. This is
everybody's pension, everybody's 401(k), everybody's college fund,
and not a time to play games and take a cheap shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican: ``The markets
are way back up today, so I don't think you can say the president's
been hurt at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   But governments, like businesses, thrive on certainty, which
allows them to gauge the market and calibrate their approaches in a
deliberate fashion. There is no sense of certainty in American
political life today, which is why Washington as well as Wall
Street is facing the jitters this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``As economic uncertainty brings questions into peoples' own
lives,'' said GOP Representative John Linder of Georgia, ``it will
lower the job approval ratings of the president.'' Lindner, who
heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the job
approval ratings of Congress would be affected, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk to the power structure in Washington is quite
considerable,'' said Kevin Phillips, the Republican political
theorist.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be greater for the Democrats, who had hoped that the
robust economy would help them buck decades of political trends,
make gains in the midterm congressional elections and perhaps even
take back control of the House. Now those dreams are fading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether the president's problems will hurt
Democrats a little, a lot, or a whole lot, but it's clear right now
that the chances of taking back the House are pretty close to
zero,'' said Charles Cook, an independent political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   In many of the big states, where Republican governors are
cruising to reelection, Democratic aspirations are fading. In
Pennsylvania, for example, Governor Tom Ridge is heavily favored
for a second term, and Democratic challengers like Joe Hoeffel, who
is trying to defeat GOP Representative Jon Fox in a swing district
outside Philadelphia, are stalling. Hoeffel needs moderate
Republican women to vote for him, and that seems less likely in the
wake of the presidential sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The president helped boost Democratic turnout in places like
Arkansas and Iowa in 1996, but he isn't on the ticket in 1998, and
Democrats worry that his political difficulties will dampen party
turnout this year. That endangers lawmakers like Democratic
Representatives Vic Snyder of Little Rock and Leonard Boswell, who
is running for reelection in the very district once served by Jim
Ross Lightfoot, who is considered a heavy favorite in the state's
gubernatorial election.
</P>
<P>
   Just Tuesday, as the stock market rebounded, the Republicans
launched their first issue-advocacy campaign with a series of
television advertisements in Nevada. The campaign is based on party
polling showing, according to Lindner, that integrity and honesty
in government have emerged as the top priorities among voters in
districts scattered around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans before have hoped that questions about Clinton's
integrity would undermine his support. Until recently, the strong
economy _ and the conviction that good times would continue to roll
_ allowed Clinton to retain his political strength. This week the
markets showed some of the vulnerability of the economy, and
perhaps of the president, too.

TOWERING ROLE OF MONEY IN ELECTIONS EVIDENT IN CAMPAIGN OF STATE
CANDIDATES  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD J. LEVY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Democratic primary in New York is two weeks away,
but G. Oliver Koppell, a candidate for attorney general, has become
something of a recluse lately, often shunning the campaign trail in
favor of a tiny office that has the feel of a bookie's hideaway. By
sequestering himself for hours on end, he believes that he can win
the race: all he needs is an assistant with a sturdy dialing
finger, a few phones, and lists _ lots and lots of lists _ of
potential political contributors.
</P>
<P>
   In his umpteenth call on a recent afternoon of fund-raising from
the office, Koppell was trying to persuade a lawyer he has known
for years to give $500 to his campaign. It was the kind of
conversation that is now as much a part of state elections, from
the gubernatorial and United States senate races on down, as
issuing policy papers and kissing babies.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer had not responded to an invitation to buy a ticket to
a breakfast that Koppell is sponsoring at the Oyster Bar in
Manhattan, but he thought that with a little courting, she might
donate. He bantered with her about the Pataki administration, and
when she criticized its judicial policies, he saw an opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you need me as attorney general, to provide some
counterweight,'' Koppell said. Her response provoked an anxious
laugh from him, and then he sheepishly made his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, can you help me a little bit? I'm sort of at the end
here.'' He paused. It was one of those uncomfortable moments that
occur regularly in these phone calls, when Koppell, who was an
Assemblyman for 23 years before serving as interim attorney general
in 1994, sounds more like a hard-luck relative seeking a handout
than a respected former public servant.
</P>
<P>
   They chatted some more. ``I need to raise another $40,000, as of
yesterday morning,'' he said. ``That's why I'm doing this. Could
you do 500? That would be great. Thank you. Thank you. And, I'm
going to actually send a messenger to pick it up because we're in
that kind of, we're in that kind of a bind to, uh, to, uh, to pay
for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone seeking compelling evidence of the towering role of money
in major elections might be well advised to spend a few hours in
the twilight of this campaign with Koppell as he tries to
buttonhole affluent people over the phone. It is a monotonous
ritual that increasingly swallows up the lives of many candidates,
one that is born of the inexorable pressure to harvest funds to buy
television commercials and other advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates devote less time than Koppell to these calls,
perhaps because they are resigned to being outspent by their rivals
or they just cannot bear to subject themselves to the regimen of
appeal after appeal. But most conclude that these days, when much
of the political battle is waged on television, they have little
choice but to do some fund-raising on the phone _ unless they are
fortunate enough to have personal wealth at their disposal.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of the system's critics, who include many Democrats
like Koppell himself, these demands prompt politicians to focus on
voters who have the means to write big checks, and can leave
candidates owing political debts to those who gave money. Those
debts can in turn lead to the type of suspected prefential
treatment and other possible abuses that are now under
investigation by prosecutors on both the state and federal level,
the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that I know that Spitzer is doing is
visiting senior centers,'' said Koppell, referring to one of his
rivals, Eliot Spitzer, a millionaire who is financing his campaign
with his own money. ``I think that's a very worthwhile thing to do,
because seniors vote. I can't do that. If I don't raise this
$40,000 by primary day, it means we are going to have to cut down
our mailings or our TV buy or some of each. As it is, it's very
meager.'' Many Republicans, who have blocked efforts in Albany to
revamp the state system, respond to the Democrats' attacks by
saying that limits on fund-raising will inevitably impinge on the
constitutional rights of people to contribute to politicians whose
views they back. Some Republicans also contend that reform plans
are really aimed at hindering their party's historic advantage over
the Democrats in collecting money.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the New York City Council, which is controlled by
Democrats, overwhelmingly approved legislation that it hopes will
alleviate some of the fund-raising burdens in city elections. The
Council's solution is to lower the contribution limits and give
candidates more city aid for their campaigns. Unlike the city, the
state does not subsidize campaigns, and it has far higher limits.
</P>
<P>
   Most prominent candidates decline to allow outsiders to view
their fund-raising calls, usually because they find the process
demeaning and do not want voters to see the lengths that they will
go for money. But Koppell and another attorney general candidate,
State Sen. Catherine Abate, agreed to let a reporter watch them on
the phone, saying that if more people understand how the system
works, support for changing it will grow.
</P>
<P>
   For candidates like Koppell and Ms. Abate, the logic of making
calls rather than using those hours to greet people at parks or
give speeches is difficult to refute, at least from a strictly
political standpoint. For example, a 30-second commercial in New
York City on the ``Today'' show costs roughly $1,700, but it might
be viewed by as many as 20,000 primary voters, political
consultants say.
</P>
<P>
   On a good day, a candidate can raise $1,700 in less than an hour
on the phone, and obviously, it would be very difficult to speak in
person to as many as 20,000 voters in an hour, even for only 30
seconds.

COMPANIES PLAN TO BUY BACK OWN SHARES AFTER DRASTIC MARKET DROP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Ariz.)   (af)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A day after the market tumbled 512 points, companies large and
small attempted Tuesday to reassure investors by announcing that
they planned to buy back their own shares.
</P>
<P>
   The Comcast Corp., the cable-television giant, said it would buy
back up to $500 million of its stock. The Boeing Co., made a
similar announcement after the markets closed on Monday, saying it
planned to purchase up to 15 percent of its outstanding shares.
</P>
<P>
   And, among more than a dozen small companies announcing such
buybacks, Movie Gallery Inc., a video store chain based in Dothan,
Ala., said it would spend up to $5 million on its own shares.
</P>
<P>
   But if the past is a guide, not all the stock buybacks will
benefit shareholders. Many companies also bought their own shares
after Black Monday in October 1987. And, at least one study showed
that most of the companies that bought back their stock after that
market crash lagged behind the rest of the market in later years.
</P>
<P>
   The buybacks, some investment analysts say, can be a sign of a
weak company desperately attempting to improve prospects in the
short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weak markets encourage weak companies to buy back stock,''
said Carol Bruckner Coles, president of Mitchell &AMP; Co., a
consulting firm in Waltham, Mass., that did a study of the stock
buybacks after the 1987 crash. Many of the companies that bought
back stock in 1987 were showing weak profits, she said, and the
additional spending to repurchase stock only seemed to weaken them
further.
</P>
<P>
   And other analysts have pointed out the money some companies use
to buy back shares may be better spent on the development of new
products or the purchase of more efficient machinery.
</P>
<P>
   But as the market has declined in the last month, more and more
companies have announced they would buy back shares. With one month
of the year's third quarter yet to go, the number of companies
announcing buyback programs already far exceeds the companies doing
so in either the first or second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Securities Data Co., 391 companies announced
buyback programs between July 1 and Aug. 28 compared with 299
companies doing so in the first quarter and 280 companies in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives propose stock buyback programs because they
are convinced the programs will increase share prices. Often, the
stock buybacks can lure investors by making a company's earnings
and cash flow numbers look better. While the company's total
earnings remain unchanged, the earnings-per-share calculation moves
higher because as the company buys back stock, there are fewer
shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a company with 10 million shares outstanding and
profits of $10 million has earnings of $1 a share. But if it buys
back half of those shares, it instantly has doubled its earnings,
to $2 a share, without actually earning an extra dime.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's chairman, Philip M. Condit, said in a statement, ``We
believe that this is an effective way to return value to our
shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said the company had more cash on hand than it needed for
operations. In trading Tuesday, shares of Boeing rose $2.125, to
$33.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Chao, an analyst who covers Boeing for Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, said that Boeing's move should benefit investors. ``If
a company has better places to put its cash, you'd rather see it go
to those things,'' Chao said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Boeing had more cash _ more than $3 billion _ than
it could use on research. And, the company's merger last year with
McDonnell Douglas makes any other major acquisitions unlikely, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many times, companies announce that they plan to buy back
shares, but never do so.
</P>
<P>
   Most worrisome, analysts say, are the companies that borrow
money to buy back their stock. At least one company, Sinclair
Broadcast Group Inc., said Tuesday that it planned to borrow money
to buy its shares.
</P>
<P>
   Such borrowings are rare, said David Fried, editor of the
Buyback Letter, which is published in Phoenix. ``But I don't like
to see it.''

PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN SEEKS SEPARATE IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., originally filed and held on 8-31, this story is now
released. Please use this version.)  
(mk) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ Resisting pressure to forge closer ties with
mainland China, President Lee Teng-hui says he is seeking to break
out of the isolation imposed by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In language that contrasted with the vision outlined by Chinese
leaders and by President Clinton during his trip to Beijing two
months ago, Lee in an interview on Monday ridiculed Beijing's
concept of ``one China'' and emphasized that Taiwan's destiny must
be determined only by the people of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   He scoffed at suggestions that he work out some kind of deal
with the mainland over Taiwan's future.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's comments, his first to an American publication since
Clinton's trip, underscored Taiwan's growing sense of identity
separate from China. Some American scholars and Washington
officials have been warning that the risk of military conflict is
growing because Taiwan and China are drifting apart, and because
Beijing has increasing doubts that Taiwan will ever voluntarily
return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for more than two hours alternately in Mandarin,
English and Japanese, occasionally in the same sentence and always
with exuberance, Lee offered perhaps his clearest statement so far
of his aspirations for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his official position that Taiwan wants to reunify
with the mainland once China achieves democracy, but he also
referred to reunification in ways that are sure to alarm China's
leaders. Asked if he envisioned reunification as the creation of a
single state or as something looser, like a Chinese version of the
British commonwealth, Lee grinned and suggested that just about
anything was possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the final form will be _ a federal form, a commonwealth _
we don't know,'' Lee said during the two hour-interview. ``It's too
early to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said Taiwan was prepared to consider reunification
if China became free and democratic, he made it clear that he
thought this would take decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think how difficult that would be,'' he said, adding, ``It
would be like a miracle happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the point, Lee said it might be possible for China to
become democratic in 20 years or more.
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly complained about Taiwan's isolation in the world
today and said he had been searching for ways to break through that
isolation. He gave no hint of any particular steps he had in mind,
although he made clear he was not thinking about concessions to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars, including Joseph Nye Jr., a former assistant
secretary of Defense and now dean of Harvard University's Kennedy
School of Government, have proposed package deals intended to
reduce the risk of a war in the Taiwan Strait. The deals usually
include a promise by China not to use armed force, in exchange for
a pledge by Taiwan either that it will not declare independence or
that it will eventually reunify with the rest of China.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was scornful of such proposals, saying they would never
work. Asked why Taiwan is so reluctant to become engaged with the
mainland, when it claims to intend to get married, Lee said
Taiwanese were afraid of losing their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prefer the status quo,'' he said. ``We prefer to stay
single. Why get engaged if engagement is equivalent to becoming a
local government and making ourselves slaves?''
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign and local scholars have said the broader problem is
simply that Taiwan is a democracy now, and ordinary Taiwanese have
become increasingly alienated from the mainland, with no intention
of ever tying the knot. In the latest government-sponsored poll,
only 18 percent of people on Taiwan say they want to reunify with
the mainland, even in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of Taiwan's drift from China, a growing number
of Taiwanese say in polls that they see themselves as ``Taiwan
people'' rather than ``Chinese people.'' Asked how he saw himself,
Lee did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Taiwan person first and a Chinese person second,'' he
said. ``All of us came a long time ago from mainland China, and we
spend our lives here. So we love this place. But of course, we are
all Chinese as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after aides expressed concern at how that comment might
be interpreted, Lee returned to the room and added by way of
explanation, ``I am Taiwanese, and I am Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeatedly emphasized his view that Taiwan has no need to
declare independence because it is already an independent,
sovereign country, formally known as the Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Some Americans in Congress and elsewhere have criticized Clinton
for declaring a ``three no's policy'' about Taiwan during his visit
to China: no support for Taiwan independence, no support for two
Chinas or ``one China, one Taiwan,'' and no support for membership
for Taiwan in international organizations that require statehood.
But Lee did not seem particularly bothered by the ``three no's,''
and said he believed assurances that U.S. policy had not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the American and Chinese assertions of ``one China''
policies, Lee and other officials offered a very different vision:
They acknowledge that there is a single China as a cultural and
historic zone, just as there is one Europe, but they say this
historic China is now divided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taiwan's destiny isn't China's to decide,'' he said. ``It's
for the 21 million people on Taiwan to decide their destiny.''

PENTAGON AND CIA DEFEND SUDAN MISSILE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Defense Secretary William Cohen and the director of
Central Intelligence, George Tenet, told 42 senators at a
classified briefing Tuesday that they are convinced the United
States has strong evidence to justify its attack on a suspected
chemical-weapons site in the Sudan, according to a person who
attended the closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Tenet repeated their assertions that tests of a soil
sample taken by the CIA near the Shifa pharmaceutical plant in
Khartoum some months ago proved the presence of Empta, a chemical
they said is used to manufacture VX, a deadly nerve agent, in a
process developed by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   And they provided what they said was new and not fully evaluated
evidence of financial ties between the plant's owner, Saleh Idris,
and Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi millionaire who the United
States believes masterminded the bombings of two U.S. embassies in
Africa on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, several businessmen in the Sudan also have said in
interviews that they suspect that Idris may be connected to bin
Laden. They said that Idris, who worked at banks in the Sudan and
Saudi Arabia, began investing heavily in Sudanese businesses in
early 1996, around the time that Sudan asked bin Laden to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Along with electronically intercepted telephone conversations
from inside the factory, the evidence cited to the senators
supports strong suspicions that the plant in Khartoum was part of a
secret chemical-weapons program that could have been used by bin
Laden, Cohen and Tenet said, according to the person who attended
the briefing, who spoke on condition that his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials, European diplomats and chemical-weapons
experts have questioned the strength of the evidence, but none of
the senators did, according to this person, who said Cohen and
Tenet received a round of applause at the conclusion of the
briefing. He said they are convinced that the decision to destroy
the plant was sound, though they have backed away from assertions
that bin Laden was a direct investor in the plant, which they
initially described as making no commercial products, when in fact
it produced medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's ambassador to the United States, Mahdi Ibrahim Mohamed,
said in an interview Tuesday that his government would have
cooperated with the United States in an investigation of the plant
before the cruise missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have talked to us about it,'' he said. ``They could
have asked our cooperation. It certainly would have been given. A
plant is not like a terrorist who can take a flight to Afghanistan.
It was a sitting duck. To take the decision unilaterally to bomb
this plant is not justified. It was a grave attack on the
sovereignty of our country. It was an act of lawlessness against
the Sudan.''

GRAF TAKES NEXT STEP IN COMEBACK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the distinctly nonregal hour of 11 o'clock in the morning,
there was a pitty-pat of applause as Steffi Graf returned from a
year in the tennis netherworld. One discreet little sign was taped
in front of two expensive box seats. It said, ``Steffi Queen of the
Courts/ Kids Take Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 29, Graf has enough to do to represent herself and
her ancient knees and aching back, but she is also being called
upon to represent her generation against callow youngsters like
Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova and all those Williamses who
think it's their turn.
</P>
<P>
   There was a rash quotation from Hingis a few months ago that
suggested Graf was history. Graf was reported to have bristled at
Hingis' words, but she denies she is coming back for the
satisfaction of beating up on the new kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need to prove to anybody but myself,'' Graf would say
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She also has her fans, who have been following her since she was
a teen-ager herself. Darnette Vickers and Jane Krumm, both of New
Jersey, upgraded their normal tickets from $20 (which seats you at
eye level with the Fuji blimp) to $175 (which seats you below the
shrimp-eaters in the luxury boxes), just to be close enough to hear
the ``thwack'' of the punishing Graf forehand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steffi's not that old,'' Vickers insisted. ``I don't see
anybody as consistent as she was, in her younger days.''
</P>
<P>
   In Graf's younger days, she won five U.S. Open titles, including
the match that concluded her Grand Slam sweep of the four major
championships in 1988 _ a decade ago, if you want to look at it
that way. Her left knee finally gave out during the 1997 French
Open, and she spent eight months recuperating from surgery, and
then she pulled a hamstring early this year. There were questions
whether she would ever come back.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last time Graf played the Open, in 1996, they have
opened up Arthur Ashe Stadium and shaved the top off the old joint,
now known as Stadium 2. Tuesday, Graf was feeling out the new
place, trying to build on victories over Lindsay Davenport and Jana
Novotna in a warm-up tournament in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponent was Corina Morariu, a 20-year-old American who
lives in the same Florida town of Boca Raton, but the two had never
lunched, taken a hit together, or even met.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where she lives,'' Graf would say later. ``Do
you?''
</P>
<P>
   In the tennis hierarchy, Morariu resided on the 32nd rung and
Graf merely on the 26th, but Graf had witnesses in the sun-dappled
stadium who remembered other days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been following her since before 1988,'' said Krumm, the
other bearer of the modest Graf sign.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the tennis world lives with the image of Graf the grim
reaper, indomitable and humorless and solipsistic. She earned this
reputation by reporting for duty, drubbing somebody in less than an
hour, and then catching the next limo or the next jet away from the
premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a human side to her,'' Vickers said. ``It's the nature
of the game, to keep your focus, but she's always been friendly the
few times I've talked to her. She always stops to talk, she's very
gracious.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf is not looking to be known as the kinder, gentler Steffi.
She is just trying to prove she can play. She looked lithe and
limber, producing the old atomic forehand that left skid marks deep
in the corners. On set point, she stood at the baseline and created
a backhand drop shot that plopped in safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely a crazy one to play,'' she would admit later.
</P>
<P>
   Morariu won the second set with a backhand down the line, but
the problem seemed to be more in Graf's mind than her knees, which
is always preferable.
</P>
<P>
   In the third set, there was a backhand lob that set up a break
in the second game. In the expensive seats, Vickers chanted
``Stef-fee! Stef-fee! Stef-fee!'' with a fervor that could be heard
around the semiempty stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Graf won the match, 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, and the level of applause was
more than polite, with fans welcoming her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come in here and say, you know, I am going to win, I
can win,'' Graf said. ``Who knows, maybe I can win, it is nothing
that I particularly look very hard ahead on. I have never done
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, at the same early hour of 11 a.m., Graf plays Marlene
Weingartner of Germany on Court 2, the old place where she left a
lot of ball marks in the deep corners, and earned her
fans-for-life.

GOVERNMENT ACCUSES MICROSOFT, GATES OF `REWRITING HISTORY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sharply worded legal brief, government lawyers
have accused Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and other company
executives of an ``astonishing lack of recall'' when the officials
were questioned about the Redmond-based software giant's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Executives who are stated to be the author of documents claim
not to remember writing them,'' said the brief filed Monday and
made public Tuesday. ``Executives who are the stated recipients of
documents claim not to remember receiving them. And both authors
and recipients claim not to know what the documents mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the federal government, 20 states and the District
of Columbia complained of Gates' conduct in an 89-page brief urging
a federal judge not to dismiss the government's anti-trust case
against Microsoft. The brief referred to Microsoft's motion for
dismissal as ``frivolous,'' accused the company of ``distorting and
mischaracterizing the extensive factual record,'' dubbed
Microsoft's decision to change some of its licensing practices a
``courthouse conversion,'' and characterized a portion of
Microsoft's defense as ``a semantic sleight of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman angrily rejected the government's
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the government has lost faith in the
substance of its case and is resorting to this kind of
name-calling,'' said Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan.
</P>
<P>
   In the brief, the government lawyers said Gates, who is to be
questioned for a third day Wednesday, ``displayed a particular
failure of recollection'' during the first two days of his
deposition last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Gates' testimony appears to be part of a pattern of
Microsoft attempting to rewrite history,'' the lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, the government lawyers said that Microsoft
executives now studiously avoid use of the term ``browser'' to
describe its technology for retrieving information from the
Internet, apparently because the company wants to convince a judge
that the browsing function is an inseparable component of
Microsoft's widely used computer operating system, Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although browser is a term used ... in the dictionary
Microsoft publishes for software professionals, in the interest of
Microsoft's litigation arguments it becomes a non-word,'' the
government said. ``Witnesses claim they don't know what a browser
is. What used to be browsers are now simply bits of browsing
technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan said the government is simply frustrated that Microsoft
executives aren't saying what the lawyers wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our executives have been very cooperative with the
government's investigation,'' he said. ``We have answered every
question to the best of our ability, but the facts don't support
the government's case, so it's not surprising that the government
doesn't want to hear the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Cullinan said it is unreasonable to expect Gates to remember
every electronic message that crosses his desk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have provided the government with over 1 million pages of
e-mail and other documents,'' Cullinan said. ``Bill Gates gets over
100 e-mails on a slow day, so it's not surprising that he can't
remember receiving a particular e-mail out of the 150,000 he has
received over the past four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Gates' cooperativeness comes in the midst of a
struggle over whether the case against Microsoft should be
dismissed or narrowed before the scheduled start of the trial Sept.
23. At issue is whether Microsoft illegally sought to extend a
monopoly on computer operating systems into the market for Internet
browsers.
</P>
<P>
   The government insisted Tuesday that there are no grounds for
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's summary judgment (dismissal) motion asks this
court to create a virtual exemption from the antitrust laws for
Microsoft and the entire computer software industry and to permit a
software monopolist such as Microsoft to use anticompetitive means
to entrench and extend its monopoly without fear of judicial
intervention,'' the government said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will respond formally in a court filing Tuesday, but
Cullinan said ``we do not believe the government has made any
significant argument against our motion for summary judgment. The
court can and should resolve this case without the need for a long,
expensive trial.''
</P>
<P>
   The government made three major arguments in insisting that the
case should go to trial: that Microsoft has engaged in predatory
conduct, that Microsoft illegally has made exclusionary agreements
with Internet service providers, Internet content providers and
computer manufacturers, and that Microsoft has unlawfully tied its
browser to its operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft clearly possesses monopoly power; its conduct has
excluded competition; and its conduct cannot be justified by
self-serving pronouncements as to the benefits of integration,''
the government wrote. As evidence of Microsoft's exercise of
monopoly power, the government claimed that the cost of computer
operating systems, as a percentage of the cost of a personal
computer, has been rising.
</P>
<P>
   The government's original complaint relied heavily on
Microsoft's relationship with Netscape Communications Corp.,
accusing Microsoft of illegally seeking to divide the browser
market with Netscape to eliminate competition. In Tuesday's filing,
the government offered several new examples that it said
demonstrate a pattern in which Microsoft attempts to restrict or
eliminate competition.
</P>
<P>
   The government accused Microsoft of trying to persuade Intel
Corp., the world's largest computer chip manufacturer, to cease
software development, of trying to persuade Apple Computer Inc. to
stop marketing its QuickTime multimedia technology for use with
Windows, and of trying to persuade RealNetworks Inc. not to share
its technology with Microsoft's competitors. The details of these
accusations were largely edited out of the public version of the
deposition because of confidentiality concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate the government is trying to raise new
allegations in the last few days before the start of the trial, but
these allegations are false,'' said Cullinan. ``Microsoft has
competed fairly in the marketplace. That's the way we have
succeeded.''

 &HT;    Riding out a fickle market
 &HT;    BellSouth enjoys 'safe haven' catchet among investors, but
others aren't so lucky.
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day's safe haven is the next day's treacherous risk.
</P>
<P>
   As the case of BellSouth Corp. seemed to prove this week,
panic-ridden investors look for a place to park their money during
a storm, searching for safety, stability and solid management. Then
they are just as quick to flee shelter when the skies suddenly
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, stock prices plunged and BellSouth was one of the few
winners, climbing 25 cents to $68.56 1/2. Yet when the market
reversed course, with the Dow Jones industrial average leaping 288
points Tuesday, BellSouth took a whacking, dropping $2.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Those abrupt changes can be disconcerting even for large
companies like BellSouth, but for young Internet companies,
fickleness can be lethal. The Net companies helped lead the stock
market to spectacular highs earlier this year. But when a slide
begins, they are in the front of the pack again, said analyst Jeff
John at Robinson-Humphrey Co. ``Maybe those who climbed the highest
had the farthest to fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite, which provides Internet services, has fallen from $53.50
a share to $24 since early July. Shares of USWeb have dipped from
$36.75 in April to less than $15. Atlanta-based MindSpring
Enterprises has seen its stock drop in five weeks from $50 a share
to $30.25.
</P>
<P>
   But MindSpring is profitable, while many new technology
companies are still struggling toward profitability. For them, a
bear market could spell doom. If they run out of money to pay for
operations, they could be unable to raise more by selling stock.
</P>
<P>
   Even WorldCom, about to complete its acquisition of MCI, could
be hurt by a long market decline. Although analysts expect WorldCom
to delay other purchases while incorporating MCI, its past
acquisitions have to a large extent been possible because the
company stock enjoyed a high price, allowing WorldCom to use the
shares as currency. WorldCom shares rose $3 Tuesday. But another
downturn that would be dangerous to the newer companies might be
soothing to BellSouth shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend that our investors stay in the higher-quality
names,'' said Mel Marten, analyst with Edward Jones &AMP; Co. ``The
kind of companies that have been through a market downturn before
and are well-positioned to go through it again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the market has stumbled, BellSouth has been among the best
performers, falling far less than the Dow this year, said David
Burks, analyst with Hilliard, Lyons. ``And we would assume that
this stock would continue to hold its own. If BellSouth is not a
haven, at least it will be perceived as a haven.''

 &HT;    Shut down by pilot strike, Northwest launches layoffs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minneapolis _ Northwest Airlines began laying off workers
Tuesday _ and may idle more today _ because of the pilots strike
that has grounded the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Northwest and the Air Line Pilots Association
met in Washington with Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater in an
attempt to restart contract negotiations. President Clinton had
asked for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's initial furloughs didn't include any of the 1,800
mechanics at Northwest's maintenance hangar in Atlanta, but further
announcements are expected today.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants union said Northwest has delayed plans to
furlough them because it would make it harder to quickly restart
the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Another strike loomed at Air Canada, where pilots set a strike
deadline of midnight Tuesday over issues of pay and working
conditions. Air Canada was trying to find alternate transportation
for 60,000 passengers who fly the airline daily.
</P>
<P>
   Also, AirTran Airlines and its flight attendants union are
scheduled to begin last-ditch talks today toward an initial
contract. If those talks fail, the Association of Flight Attendants
has threatened to begin unannounced spot walkouts on AirTran
flights this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran has 120 daily departures at Hartsfield International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta has been largely spared the travel disruptions caused by
the shutdown at Northwest, which has its hubs in Minneapolis,
Detroit and Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said if the Northwest strike reaches
Labor Day, Clinton may reconsider his decision not to intervene and
order a 60-day ``cooling off'' period as he did last year minutes
after a strike by American Airlines pilots began.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have set aside enough cash for a long stoppage. The
pilots have about $65 million on hand, and Northwest has about $3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can go as long as it takes,'' union spokesman Dean Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest has estimated the strike would cost it $175 million in
the first 10 days but has not projected losses beyond that.
Beginning 35 days into the strike, Northwest's 6,100 pilots would
get strike pay of $1,300 a month _ which amounts to almost $8
million per month out of the union's strike funds. The pilots say
they have access to $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest says it has offered a new contract pushing the average
pilot salary to $150,000. But the union says the figure is
misleading and the offer doesn't include adequate payback for past
union concessions. It also wants tighter job security provisions.

 &HT;    Bulls, bears talk turkey about stocks
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Monday, we were all going to die.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street had become Maul Street. Stock prices plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were back up, and bloody Monday seemed like maybe Wall
Street had just nicked itself shaving.
</P>
<P>
   What the heck was happening?
</P>
<P>
   Experts can't agree. As for the average Joe, the stock market's
wild ride can be entirely baffling, if only because the financial
terms can be so arcane.
</P>
<P>
   So many weird ``investment instruments.'' So many
strange-sounding stock exchanges that might be funny, were they not
threatening to drive us into a global recession.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick primer on some of the jargon you'll be hearing as
the financial world continues to squirm.
</P>
<P>
   Stock: A share of ownership in a corporation. As people buy and
sell stocks, prices rise and fall. Trading takes place at ``stock
exchanges,'' the frantic, litter-strewn places you see during
almost every TV report on financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Bull market: A period of rising stock prices, during which
everybody and his broker try to cash in. Origin of the term is
unknown, but it's been around since the 1700s, and supposedly
derives from a bull's habit of tossing his head upward.
</P>
<P>
   Bear market: A period of falling stocks prices. The ``bear''
many come from an old saying: ``Selling the skin before you've
caught the bear.'' Whatever that means.
</P>
<P>
   Dead cat bounce: Inspired by someone's vision of what happens
when a dead pet is thrown from a roof, the term describes a falling
stock market that rebounds briefly, then plunges again. If stock
prices fall today, you can use the term to impress (or disgust)
your friends.
</P>
<P>
   New York Stock Exchange: The largest and oldest stock exchange
in the United States, founded in 1792 and located on Wall Street in
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   NASDAQ: An electronic stock exchange. Unlike at the New York
Stock Exchange, where crazed traders scream and throw scraps of
paper on the trading floor, NASDAQ traders, in offices around the
country, scream and throw scraps of paper at their computer
screens.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund: A company run by an expert or firm who presumably
knows what he, or she, or it is doing. The fund buys stocks or
other investments with its subscribers' money. Average folks tend
to invest through mutual funds, and if they start taking money out,
it's a sign the public is worried about the market.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones Industrial Average: The most-cited measure of how the
stock market is doing, the Dow is based on the price of 30 ``blue
chip'' stocks of major American corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Nikkei Stock Average: An index of 225 Japanese stocks. It and
other Asian indexes, like Hong Kong's Hang Seng, have fallen
lately. The Asian exchanges open before the American ones, and can
cause investors here to brace themselves, or, as they did Monday,
run screaming in panic.
</P>
<P>
   FTSE: Pronounced ``footsie.'' It's the English stock exchange.
Full name: Financial Times Stock Exchange. Not the most important
term to know, but it sounds funny.

GOOD GUY VAUGHN RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Speed Dog returneth?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you can read that two ways. There is the immediate
meaning, and there is the long-range meaning.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Mo Vaughn, the certified Hit Dog, stole 11
bases, thus earning the alternate nickname Speed Dog. Alas, that
was then and this is now. He has stolen only four bases since, none
this season. Management sort of let him know that he wasn't going
to be the next Barry Bonds. Mo was looking at the 400-400 Club,
perhaps. Management was looking at him rolling around the dirt in
agony after some messed-up belly flop.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but Monday night we were treated to Speed Dog II. Mo gave
the crowd a rise with two bold baserunning maneuvers. He advanced
from first to second on a Nomar Garciaparra bases-loaded fly,
making it into second with an artful headfirst slide and hand tag a
split-second ahead of Ken Griffey's throw from center. Later in the
game he went from first to third on a Mike Stanley single when no
one was expecting him to. Is the next stolen base imminent?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' shrugs Vaughn. ``We've just got something good going
here and I wanted to keep it rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the larger issue. Dan Duquette was actually heard
saying nice things about Mo during a pinch-hit TV stint on NESN
Monday night. He lauded Mo's baserunning. He lauded Mo's hitting.
He even put in a word for Mo's fielding. This is the same general
manager who has passed on many opportunities to say something
positive about the first baseman all season long. Is there a thaw?
Is it possible the Hit/Speed Dog might be returning to Fenway after
all?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where I'm going to be next year,'' Vaughn said
before Tuesday night's game. ``But I kind of look at it like this:
I stated my case six weeks ago. That cleared the air for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meaning?
</P>
<P>
   ``Meaning I could just go out and play the game,'' Mo continued.
``All I've ever wanted to do was the game without all the
accusations and things. I want to enjoy the game and enjoy the
situation I'm in, and not get caught up in all those things I can't
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mo is handling the game pretty well these days, even if he isn't
having quite the season he thinks he is. With a decent September
he'll threaten 120 runs batted in, but it must be pointed out that
120 ribbies in 1998 aren't the same as 120 ribbies a decade ago. A
lot of guys drive in 100 these days. It's almost a minimum standard
to be considered One of the Boys.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm a Mo guy all the way. I want him here
next year and for many years to come. But this isn't a great year
for someone with Mo's capabilities. He can do better.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Mo hadn't heard about the Duquette compliments, and he
didn't seem particularly fazed by them, one way or the other. It
really doesn't matter to him right now, because he's not worrying
about next year, not when he's having such a good time right now.
</P>
<P>
   Mo is having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when the last game of the season will be,'' he
said. ``It might be the last game of the World Series. It might be
the last game of the regular season. Whenever it is, it will be a
sad day for me because this is the best bunch of individuals I've
ever been around. That's what I'm thinking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each team, each year, is different. The situations are never
the same. People come and go, and what I'm thinking about is where
everyone will be next year, and not just where I'm going to be. I'm
wondering if it will ever be like this again.''
</P>
<P>
   It may all sound a bit over the top to the outsider. I mean,
we're not talking about the 1927 Yankees, or even the 1977 Red Sox.
It's a reasonably lovable, feisty team that ought to finish with a
victory total somewhere in the mid 90s, and, that, given a bit o'
luck (and with a couple of big performances from Pedro), could make
a little noise in the postseason. It is surely not a great team.
</P>
<P>
   But when you're on the inside, you look at things differently.
Only a player has a sense of the daily dynamics. Mo is smart
enough, and objective enough, to assess the talent. Other teams
have more talent. It's not always about talent.
</P>
<P>
   Mo is thinking about the way this team won all those games with
last-at-bat heroics in April and then used that 20-8 start as the
proper springboard to a fine season. He is thinking about the scrap
of Darren Bragg and the guile of Darren Lewis. He is thinking about
the way Tom Gordon has taken to the closer's job. He is thinking
not only about the post-April comeback victories, but the many
near-misses that have told the baseball world that if there is one
team to whom the cliche (itals)the game isn't over until the last
out (unitals) applies, it's the 1998 Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   And he's thinking about private moments in the clubhouse and on
the buses that we will never know about.
</P>
<P>
   There was a point this season when Mo was in danger of losing
his joie de vivre, and that would have been too bad. No way that
will happen now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all the venom out six weeks ago,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   He is simply not going to allow worries about the future to
spoil the joy of the present. Could he return? Well, sure, he
could, and it's nice that the GM is through tossing out his little
verbal grenades. Meanwhile ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with what we've accomplished, and with what we might
accomplish,'' he said, ``and I'm just happy to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mo, after you guys clinch, how 'bout one more stolen base
for old time's sake?

PLANS A AND B SCUTTLED, WHAT ARE RUSSIA'S OPTIONS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: RUSSIA-SUMMIT, RUSSIA-SCENE, RUSSIA-ARMS,
RUSSIA-POLITICS) 
(JT) 
 By SYLVIA NASAR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plan A, a $23.6 billion program courtesy of the International
Monetary Fund, failed in less than four weeks. Plan B, a
devaluation and debt moratorium cobbled together by young Russian
reformers, collapsed within days. Neither prevented investors from
fleeing or citizens from turning every ruble they have into
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Russia's central bank is nearly out of dollars, its banks
are out of cash, and its government is not just in de facto default
on its loans, but for most practical purposes, defunct. And those
who have ridden to Russia's rescue before _ the IMF, the United
States, the Group of Seven industrialized democracies _ are ruling
out a bailout.
</P>
<P>
   So what options are left for restoring financial stability?
</P>
<P>
   Even as Russia struggles to form a new coalition government,
some prominent Western economists are considering measures that
would have been dismissed as extremist a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Economists outline three possible courses of action for Moscow:
Take the populist path of tightening direct control over the
economy, including foreign-exchange controls that would make it
difficult to convert the ruble into dollars or German marks. Or
strike a deal with the monetary fund, paying at least lip service
to tight money, budget balancing and orderly debt-restructuring.
Or, most radically, link the nation's finances to a strong foreign
currency like the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The last two proposals, both intended to preserve Russian access
to foreign capital, could be pursued at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the choice Russia seems to be leaning toward
_ the populist package _ seems the most likely to lead to
hyperinflation, social unrest and a lurch toward nationalism _ or
worse. Even the usually circumspect IMF managing director, Michel
Camdessus, warned that the populist scenario ``would lead to
disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider that option first. Communists in Parliament are talking
about a full retreat from a market economy, including nationalizing
banks to protect depositors, renationalizing major industries to
raise output and government revenue and instituting price controls
to protect the ruble and dampen inflation _ all to bring a sense of
order to daily living.
</P>
<P>
   The linchpin of their plan involves foreign-exchange controls
that would ban dollar-denominated bank accounts abroad and force
exporters to sell their foreign currency to the central bank at a
fixed rate. The hope is that by making it impossible to buy
dollars, the Russians could stem capital flight and stabilize the
ruble.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Western economists deplore exchange controls as
authoritarian and prone to abuse, some believe that they may be the
lesser of evils right now. ``The foreign exchange must be closed,''
said Padma Desai, a professor of Russian studies at Columbia
University and a proponent of gradual economic reform in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree. Paul Krugman, an international economist at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who recently wrote an
article for Fortune magazine advocating exchange controls in
several Asian nations, thinks that they would fail in Russia. In
his view, Russia's oligarchs _ the tycoons who control the biggest
banks and businesses _ would easily circumvent them. ``If having
dollars is criminal, only criminals will have dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are other problems. Foreign-exchange controls risk
triggering inflation by giving Russia's central bank a free hand to
print more rubles. At best, the government could keep inflation at
bay with Soviet-style shortages and rationing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a heavy dose of state intervention would fuel capital
flight and scare off foreign investors. And it would certainly cost
Russia the rest of the $22.6 billion IMF loan package announced in
July. Exchange controls violate the IMF charter.
</P>
<P>
   A second alternative would be a modified version of the fund's
program. That would please Washington, which contends that if
Russia would just push ahead with the tax, banking and other
economic reforms stipulated by the IMF to restore confidence in the
ruble, the West would be willing to lend more money. This is
essentially the message that President Clinton is bringing to his
summit meeting with President Boris Yeltsin in Moscow this week.
</P>
<P>
   There is just one problem. This hope-for-the-best approach flies
in the face of political reality as it has unfolded since Yeltsin
changed his prime minister, replacing Sergei Kiriyenko, an advocate
of economic reform, with the more conservative Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way the Russians can get international financing is
if they cut their budget deficit,'' said Anders Aslund, an
economist at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace and an adviser to the
Russian government in the early 1990s. The only way to balance the
Russian budget quickly is to transfer revenue from the regional
governments, which spend huge sums to prop up money-losing banks
and industries, to the central government, Aslund said. But, he
said, ``Chernomyrdin was brought in to make sure that the banks
were bailed out, that regional governments weren't put under
pressure and that barter can survive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What really stands in the way of fiscal reform is Russia's
failure to develop a separate government budget, central bank and
private sector. ``There's one common pot, one budget, one credit
card which is more or less used for all transactions,'' said Alvin
Rabushka, an economist at Stanford University's Hoover Institution,
a public-policy research group. ``In Russia, all losses and debts
are passed back to the federal budget and the central bank.''
</P>
<P>
   That is why money from abroad is probably not the answer. Any
cash the IMF pumps into Russia has been lent by the central bank to
banks that promptly exchange rubles for dollars. Such assistance
just increases the pressure on the ruble and capital flight.
</P>
<P>
   A third option for Russia, admittedly a desperate one, would be
to give up all pretense of trying to control the value of its
currency by linking the ruble tightly to a hard currency like the
dollar and in effect replacing its central bank with a currency
board. Under such an arrangement, the supply of rubles in
circulation would have to be fully backed by dollars and
convertible, on demand, at a fixed rate of exchange. In effect,
Russia would be handing over control of its money supply _ which
would fluctuate with the amount of dollars available _ to the
Federal Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently considered an appropriate strategy only for small
economies that rely heavily on international trade, the
currency-board proposal is gaining supporters among prominent
Western experts ranging from Camdessus to Aslund and Domingo
Cavallo, a former economics minister of Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Rudiger Dornbusch, an international economist at MIT, is a
recent convert. ``What might have been a good idea for Indonesia is
a far better one in Russia, where the economy has already been
dollarized, just as Argentina's was in 1992,'' he said. ``It's the
right cure for a crazy Duma and a lunatic President.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Steven Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns
Hopkins University and a long-time advocate of a currency board for
Russia and other ``emerging'' economies like Argentina and
Indonesia, says Russia is in too much turmoil to create a currency
board immediately. As an interim measure, he suggests that Russia
make the dollar legal tender _ as it was de facto until 1997 _
alongside the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   After all, legally or not, Russians already hold more dollars
than rubles, or $40 billion versus just $8.6 billion of their own
depreciated currency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia needs a quick fix,'' Hanke said.
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily making the dollar Russia's main currency might
produce an injection of fresh financing, without the inflation that
excessive money creation would set off. Right now, most Russians'
dollars are squirreled away in foreign bank accounts or under
mattresses and are not recirculated by domestic banks for use by
cash-starved enterprises that need to pay workers or buy raw
material.
</P>
<P>
   No short-term measures can address Russia's bedrock problems _
the lack of a functional banking system, of truly private
enterprises and of the rule of law. But Hanke said: ``The ship is
sinking, and they're trying to save passengers. They're not
worrying right now about getting them to shore.''

   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HANDSPRING-PUPPET-THEATER (Johnannesburg, South Africa) _ Basil
Jones and Adrian Kohler, founders of the Handspring Puppet Company,
will lead off the International Festival of Puppet Theater in New
York with ``Ubu and the Truth Commission.'' The two men are South
Africa's premier puppeteers. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.

<P>
   &UR; DANCE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MULTI-ACT-BALLETS (Undated) _ Today, when abstractions dominate
many ballet repertories, it's tempting to proclaim plots
unimportant. Dance is an art of movement, and the best story in the
world cannot disguise unimaginative choreography. Nevertheless,
should choreographers wish to tell tales, good stories can help
make good choreography look even better. This is especially true of
full-evening productions. Recent months have offered several
imposing multi-act story ballets, ranging from Marius Petipa's
19th-century blendings of classicism and exoticism to Boris
Eifman's contemporary balletic expressionism. By Jack Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   EQUESTRIAN-DANCE (Paris) _ Equestrian art may be as old as
ancient Greece, but Bartabas, the founder and director of the
Paris-based Zingaro Equestrian Theater, still likes to think he is
doing something new. He may well be right. Carving a niche for
himself somewhere between the classical dressage of, say, Vienna's
legendary Spanish Riding School and the athletic antics of circus
horses, the 41-year-old Frenchman has created an equestrian show
that underlines the emotional power of horses. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   HANDEL-OPERAS (New York) _ Handel has changed. For pretty much
two centuries after his death, in 1759, he was remembered primarily
as a composer of oratorios, anthems, concertos, suites and sonatas:
music that bolstered a gentlemanly image of magnificence and
decisiveness. His operas, so much more pliant and equivocal in
tone, were largely forgotten until the 1920s. On Friday, the second
night of its new season, the New York City Opera will present
Handel's ``Partenope'' in a production introduced at Glimmerglass
during the summer, and two new recordings of other Handel operas
have just appeared on the Virgin Veritas label. By Paul Griffiths.

   TANGLEWOOD-TEACHERS (Undated) _ Teachers come in different
shapes and sizes, and finding the right fit might sort out some of
the educational controversies going on at the Tanglewood Festival
up in Lenox, Mass. The troubles have been well rehearsed in these
pages, and are not likely to go away when the season ends this
weekend. Have Tanglewood's long-respected summer programs been
emasculated by dismissals and resignations, or have they been
reinvigorated by a new involvement on the part of the Boston
Symphony and its music director, Seiji Ozawa? By Bernard Holland.

for Hole on the band's third album, ``Celebrity Skin'' (Geffen),
are bound to be heard in the context of a life made for tabloid
headlines. Ms. Love is a former stripper turned punk singer and the
widow of a suicidal, heroin-using, million-selling rock star, Kurt
Cobain. After his death in 1994, she went on turn herself into a
surgically altered, couture-wearing, Oscar-nominated actress,
apparently becoming the kind of Hollywood figure that many of her
punky original fans detested. By Jon Pareles.

   EMMYLOU-HARRIS-MUSIC (Undated) _ Emmylou Harris has always
zigged when the rest of the music world has zagged. But after doing
country long before it was remotely cool, and then getting exiled
by country radio along with virtually everyone else over 40, she
seems more adept than ever at finding the seams between the
formulas emanating from Nashville and the commercial no man's land,
vaguely known as alternative country, outside the Nashville
mainstream. By Peter Applebome.

   ERNESTO-PUJOL-ART (New York) _ Moody, meticulously staged and
filled with introspective symbolism, the room-size works of Ernesto
Pujol have been fixtures on the international art circuit in recent
years and, in the eyes of many, examples of installation art at its
most evocative. In his newest work, he has branched off into
fine-art photography, and the Linda Kirkland Gallery will present
his first photographic efforts in a group show titled ``Some Like

opens Saturday and runs through Oct. 17. By Edward M. Gomez.

   CONAN-O'BRIEN-TV (Undated) _ In 1993, only one person in America
could possibly have foreseen the day when Conan O'Brien would be so
popular on late-night television that NBC would hand him an hour of
prime time to celebrate his fifth anniversary on the air: Conan
O'Brien _ in his wildest dreams. But if anybody has earned the
right to have his wildest dreams taken seriously it is O'Brien, 35,
who will indeed see that once stupefyingly unlikely event come to
pass on Sept. 16, when ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' hits the

   SCRIMSHAWING-ANTIQUES (New York) _ The hardy seamen who took up
scrimshawing to pass the time during long voyages in search of
whales more than a century ago would probably be dismayed to learn
that their handiwork had been enlisted in the cause of feminism.
But consider the evidence. The finely engraved teeth, the whalebone
pie crimpers, bodkins and busks that they made as gifts for their
wives and sweethearts back home were tokens of affection that in
the sexual politics of today might be construed as the actions of
tough guys wanting to show their soft side. An exhibition of 52
pieces of scrimshaw is currently at Snug Harbor Cultural Center's
Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art on Staten Island. By Fletcher

DALLAS COWBOYS 
1997: 6-10, 3-5 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Chan Gailey (0-0) 
Stadium: Texas Stadium (65,675) 
Ticket information: (972) 579-5000 
Pieces in place 
QB Troy Aikman (19 passing TDs), RB Emmitt Smith (1,074 rushing
yards), WR Michael Irvin (1,180 receiving yards), T Larry Allen, DT
Leon Lett, CB Deion Sanders (NFL-record 14 career TDs on returns),
CB Kevin Smith, SS Darren Woodson. 
Key newcomers 
Coach Chan Gailey, DE Greg Ellis, OT Flozell Adams, G Everett
McIver, RB Chris Warren, WR Ernie Mills. 
Key losses 
FS Brock Marion, T George Hegamin. 
Missing piece 
The Cowboys have not had a consistent wide receiver to play
alongside Irvin since Alvin Harper. Kevin Williams, in Buffalo
after a year in Arizona, was never more than a utility receiver.
And former Pro Bowl player Anthony Miller was never more than fast
last season. The candidates for the No. 2 spot this year are Billy
Davis, second-year man Macey Brooks and free-agent veteran Mills.
Because Gailey plans to use a five-receiver formation on some
plays, all will be counted on for production in certain situations.
Still, the coaching staff is hoping one emerges as another target
for Aikman. 
Biggest test 
The NFL community will know very early in the season whether last
season's dismal record was a mirage or a sign of things to come.
The Cowboys open the season at home against the up-and-coming
Arizona Cardinals, then go on the road to play the defending Super
Bowl champion Denver Broncos on Sept. 13 and the defending NFC East
champion New York Giants on Sept. 21 on Monday Night Football. 
Watch out for 
How this club responds to Gailey. Right now, the former offensive
coordinator is being called a breath of fresh air by veteran
Cowboys who had grown weary of Barry Switzer's act. But how long
will that last? Will the team have confidence in him after the
first blowout loss or lengthy losing streak? How will Gailey react
under the pressure of being the coach of the most visible team in
pro sports? 
Milestones 
Emmitt Smith needs 12 rushing touchdowns to surpass retired running
back Marcus Allen (123) as the all-time career leader. 
Overview 
The Cowboys have the best quarterback and best defense in the
division. They also have more future Hall of Famers on the roster
than anyone else. Yes, they are getting old. But with an influx of
young talent via the draft, and a new coach, Jerry Jones' money men
have one more run of greatness left.

NEW YORK GIANTS 
 
1997: 10-5-1, 7-0-1 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Jim Fassel (10-5-1) 
Stadium: Giants Stadium (78,148) 
Ticket information: (201) 935-8222 
Pieces in place 
DE Michael Strahan (14 sacks), LB Jessie Armstead (134 tackles), CB
Phillippi Sparks (5 interceptions), DT Robert Harris (10 sacks), DT
Keith Hamilton (8 sacks), QB Danny Kanell (11 passing touchdowns). 
Key newcomers 
S Shaun Williams, WR Joe Jurevicius, WR Brian Alford. 
Key loss 
RB Rodney Hampton. 
Missing piece 
Offense. Offense. Offense. The Giants need plenty of it. Their
defense will keep them in most games, but the Giants desperately
need offensive playmakers to successfully defend their NFC East
title. Oddly, the Giants' first pick in the draft went to defense.
So, Fassel and company will hope that a running-back-by-committee
run game and Kanell, in his third year, will improve by leaps and
bounds to help a unit that ranked 27th in total yards last season.
Kanell will need help from last year's top draftee, speedy wide
receiver Ike Hilliard, who was limited to two receptions in 1997
because of a neck injury. The club's leading receiver in 1997 was
Chris Calloway (58 receptions). Calloway is more of a possession
receiver. 
Biggest test 
Four of the Giants' six games from Nov. 15 to Dec. 20 are against
Green Bay, San Francisco, Denver and Kansas City. If you are
wondering whether the Giants' 1997 worst-to-first season was a
fluke, you'll know by the morning of Dec. 21. 
Watch out for 
Who is behind Kanell. The Giants will probably go into the season
with halfback Tiki Barber and fullback Charles Way as the starters.
Way is a solid blocker and was the club's leading ground gainer and
second-leading receiver. If Barber struggles to give the Giants
consistent yards, don't be surprised to see journeyman Gary Brown
getting plenty of action. He gained 945 yards rushing as a
part-time player with San Diego last year. Tyrone Wheatley also
adds to the logjam at running back. 
Milestones 
The Giants, who became the first NFC East team to go through the
division schedule undefeated in 1997, have not lost to a division
team since a 24-0 loss at Philadelphia on Dec. 1, 1996. 
Overview 
The Giants can't possibly go through the division undefeated again.
And with the nondivision schedule much stronger than last season,
New York's hold on the division title could be short-lived. The
saving grace: Eight of the Giants' first nine opponents missed the
playoffs in 1997. So perhaps a fast start could give the club the
momentum it needs to pull out an upset against a San Francisco or a
Green Bay. But that's highly unlikely.

WASHINGTON REDSKINS 
1997: 8-7-1, 4-3-1 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Norv Turner (26-37-1) 
Stadium: Jack Kent Cooke Stadium (78,600) 
Ticket information: (301) 276-6050 
Pieces in place 
RB Terry Allen (724 yards), RB Stephen Davis (567 yards), CB
Darrell Green (second among active players in career interceptions
with 44), CB Cris Dishman (4 interceptions in '97), WR Michael
Westbrook (16.4 yards per catch), QB Gus Frerotte (17 passing
touchdowns), LB Ken Harvey (9.5 sacks), KR Brian Mitchell (2,081
total yards). 
Key newcomers 
DT Dana Stubblefield, DT Dan Wilkinson, TE Stephen Alexander, RB
Skip Hicks. 
Key losses 
OT Darryl Ashmore, DE Chris Mims. 
Missing piece 
The Redskins have lots of talent at the skill positions but will
need an overachieving effort from the offensive line to be a major
force in the division. The talent on the offensive line is average
at best and incompetent most of the time. The club desperately
needs a talented left tackle, but failed to obtain one through free
agency or the draft. That means Joe Patton, who is a better left
guard, will fill in to protect Frerotte's blind spot. Left guard
Tre Johnson is coming off two shoulder surgeries. The right side of
the line is manned by guys named Shar Pourdanesh and Brad Badger.
Yikes. 
Biggest test 
We should know how the season will turn out for the Redskins before
the end of September. They open at the New York Giants, play host
to San Francisco, travel to up-and-coming Seattle and close the
month at home against Denver. 
Watch out for 
Westbrook and Frerotte. These guys are the keys to getting Turner
into the playoffs for the first time as a head coach. Both are
immensely talented. But both made boneheaded mistakes last season
that eventually kept this team out of the playoffs. If Westbrook
can control his anger and Frerotte his urge to throw dumb passes at
the worst possible times, the Redskins have a good chance of
winning the NFC East. 
Milestones 
Green, a 16-year veteran, has 44 career interceptions, second among
active players behind Atlanta's Eugene Robinson (49). 
Overview 
The Redskins should have one of the best defenses in the league and
an offense that will excite from time to time. But six of their
first eight opponents reached the playoffs in 1997. After a slow
start, look for the Redskins to rally in the latter half of 1998,
only to fall short of postseason play for the sixth consecutive
season. But watch out in 1999.

ARIZONA CARDINALS 
1997: 4-12, 2-6 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Vince Tobin (11-21) 
Stadium: Sun Devil Stadium (73,273) 
Ticket information: (800) 999-1402 
Pieces in place 
WR Rob Moore (1,584 receiving yards), WR Frank Sanders (13.6 yards
per catch), FB Larry Centers (54 receptions), DT Eric Swann (7.5
sacks), DT Mark Smith (6 sacks), DE Simeon Rice (5 sacks), CB
Aeneas Williams (6 interceptions). 
Key newcomers 
WR/KR Eric Metcalf, DE Andre Wadsworth, S Corey Chavous, RB Mario
Bates, RB Adrian Murrell. 
Key loss 
LB Eric Hill. 
Missing piece 
The offensive line. The Cardinals' best anchor, left tackle Lomas
Brown, is 35. The Cardinals added massive tackle Anthony Clement
(6-8, 348) in the draft, and he could be starting soon on the right
side. But not much else was done to improve a unit that allowed a
league-high 78 sacks in 1997. That's bad news for a club that is
resting its hopes for its first nonstrike playoff berth since 1975
on second-year quarterback Jake Plummer. 
Biggest test 
At the Cowboys for the season opener Sept. 6. The Cardinals ended a
13-game losing streak to the Cowboys with a victory in Tempe,
Ariz., last season. But they have not won at Texas Stadium since
1989. One reason for the Cardinals' sorry records this decade has
been slow starts. A victory against the Cowboys _ even if they are
a few All-Pros short of their glory days _ would give the young
Cardinals the emotional firepower to make a playoff run. A loss and
the same old doubts probably start to creep in. 
Watch out for 
Plummer's production. General manager Bob Ferguson has done a
wonderful job of stocking talent in the desert the past few years.
The addition of Metcalf helps special teams. The addition of
Murrell and Bates helps the running game, and the addition of
Wadsworth helps an already solid defense line. Now it is up to
Plummer, the second-year quarterback from Arizona State, to
produce. Yes, he has a shaky offensive line. But if he can stay
away from making the stupid plays (15 interceptions in 1997) and
let his playmakers win games for him, the Cardinals have as good a
shot as anyone to win what has become one of the weaker divisions
in the NFL. 
Milestones 
The Cardinals have not reached the playoffs in a nonstrike season
since they won the division in 1975. No club has gone longer
without a nonstrike-season playoff berth, and only the New York
Jets (1969) have gone longer without a division title. 
Overview 
The Cardinals lost six games in 1997 by a total of 20 points,
including three in overtime. This came despite having a rookie
quarterback, a defense that finished 27th in total yards allowed,
and a running game that ranked 30th. They added loads of talent via
trade and the draft. And in a division that saw one club make the
playoffs last season, the additions may be enough for a playoff
berth in the Valley of the Sun.

PHILADELPHIA EAGLES 
1997: 6-9-1, 3-5 in NFC East 
Coach (record): Ray Rhodes (27-23-1) 
Stadium: Veterans Stadium (65,352) 
Ticket information: (215) 463-5500 
Pieces in place 
QB Bobby Hoying (1,567 passing yards), RB Charlie Garner (547
rushing yards), WR Irving Fryar (1,316 receiving yards), DT Rhett
Hall (8 sacks). 
Key newcomers 
DE Hugh Douglas, OT Tra Thomas, LB Jeremiah Trotter, OG George
Hegamin, DT Bill Johnson, WR Jeff Graham. 
Key losses 
RB Ricky Watters, LB Darrin Smith, G Joe Panos. 
Missing piece 
The running game. Watters spent three stormy seasons in
Philadelphia before Seattle signed him to a free-agent contract in
the spring, but they were three productive seasons. Garner, who has
been handed Watters' job, burst on the scene as a rookie in 1994,
but hasn't parlayed that into a career that makes you think he will
be as good as Watters. Perhaps because he is the everyday starter
things will change. Whatever the case, the Eagles need a consistent
ground game to take pressure off Hoying, in his third year. 
Biggest test 
Any road game. The Eagles lost all of their eight road games last
season for the first time since the NFL-AFL merger in 1970. They
play at Denver on Oct. 4, at the New York Giants on Nov. 22, at
Green Bay on Nov. 29, and at the Cowboys on Dec. 20. 
Watch out for 
Hoying is clearly the key to the Eagles' success, but this club
will only go as far as Rhodes can will it. And lately, Rhodes'
highly emotional act has worn thin. This club underachieved in
1997, missing the playoffs despite ranking fifth in total offense
and a respectable 13th in total defense. The Eagles need Rhodes to
push the right buttons to be considered a serious playoff
contender. He didn't do that last year. 
Milestones 
The Eagles have not won on the road since a 21-20 victory against
the New York Jets on Dec. 14, 1996. 
Overview 
The club's best offensive player, Fryar, is 36. Its best defensive
player, CB Bobby Taylor, missed most of last season with a severe
knee injury. This is basically the team that won two of its final
eight games last season, minus a few talented players the club did
not re-sign in the off-season. Add all the elements, and this could
be the end of the road for Rhodes, who has had many public
disagreements with upper management.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The smoke from the stock market shootout of the last
five trading days finally began to clear on Tuesday. As the Dow
Jones industrial average rallied to close up 288.36 points, or 3.8
percent, investors began to ask: Where do we go from here?
</P>
<P>
   Good question. History, a usually useful guide, does tell us
that Septembers are not typically stellar months for stocks. Laszlo
Birinyi at Birinyi Associates points out that since 1915, the
average performance of the Dow Jones industrials during the month
of September is a decline of 0.74 percent. Septembers have also
become known as a month in which many corporations warn investors
of coming shortfalls in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But while investors fasten their safety belts in front of
further turbulence in stocks, it is worth pointing out that the
overall market today looks a lot saner than it did back in July,
when the averages peaked.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, weakness in the elite group of blue-chip stocks
that had been leading the market higher _ names like Coca-Cola,
General Electric and Microsoft _ means that the narrowness of the
market's moves is less pronounced than it was back in July and
August. The strongest market advances, according to strategists,
are those in which both large and small stocks rise. This was not
the case in the Dow Jones' run to 9337.97 in July; it left smaller
stocks in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   According to Aronson plus Partners, a money management firm in
Philadelphia, big-name stocks that make up the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index had outperformed the smaller companies found in the
Russell 2000 index by 27.5 percent in August, a divergence not seen
for 25 years. Now that spread seems to be narrowing; large stocks
have weakened while smaller stocks have leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   The realization also seems to be sinking in among investors that
earnings for the third, and possibly even the fourth quarter, could
be lower than Wall Street analysts are calling for. Although this
sounds like it would be a bad sign, it is actually positive for the
market. Why? When investors find themselves in a volatile market,
it is far better to be braced for bad news than to have it take you
by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   It takes time, of course, for lowered earnings expectations to
show up in share prices. And Tuesday's surge in stocks left the
price/earnings ratio on the S&AMP;P 500 _ the most common investor
measure of a stock's value _ at 23.66. This is by no means cheap on
a historical basis _ the price-earnings ratio on the S&AMP;P averages
16.3 going back to 1975. But it is coming back to earth, well down
from the high of 28.7 in the second quarter, a level never before
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Another positive sign in the market is that investors are
reducing their exceedingly heavy stock-market borrowings. Known as
margin debt, these borrowings had reached historic levels earlier
this year. According to Charles Peabody at Mitchell Securities in
New York, margin debt rose to $154 billion in July, up 9.7 percent
from March. Since 1995, margin debt has grown almost in tandem with
returns on the S&AMP;P 500: up 25 percent in 1995, 27 percent in 1996
and up nearly 30 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, analysts say, the tide has turned. Of course, many of the
investors who are now reducing their borrowings are being forced to
do so by their brokerage firms, who are demanding cash to prop up
falling portfolio values. But the effects on the market are
calming; fewer investors on margin means fewer investors with their
fingers on the ``sell'' trigger as stocks go down.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, nobody is claiming that stock-market volatility will
go away. Indeed, the fact that the market averages are still at
high valuation levels going into what could be weak third- and
fourth-quarter periods for earnings remains perhaps the biggest
threat to stock stability.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors looking to find their footing in an enormously
tricky market may be able to take some comfort in knowing that the
turbulencethey have just been through is far worse than that of the
1990 bear market. In some cases, the carnage exceeds that seen in
the crash of 1987. Thus, however intense their pain, they can hope
that the worst is over.
</P>
<P>
   John Manley, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, noted
that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index had slumped 12 percent in the
last five trading days. That performance is equal to the trauma
that took place in the week of the October 1987 crash and matches
the worst selloffs for a five-day trading period going back 30
years. For these reasons, Manley believes that we could be near a
bottom, if only in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Manley's data show that investors have suffered the
effects of a bear market in most stocks for months. It is only now
that the indexes have touched bear market territory as well.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, how the market's recent plunge compares
with the bear market of 1987. As of Aug. 31, the average weighted
declines in NASDAQ stocks and New York Stock Exchange shares from
their July peaks were equal to or had exceeded the damage done in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Just as they hid the overall market's weakness on the way up,
the market indexes are masking the hits that most stocks have taken
in recent weeks. Although the Dow Jones Industrials had fallen 19.2
percent from the July high to the August 31 low, nowhere near the
36.1 percent decline seen in the bear market of 1987, the internal
damage to the overall market this year has been much bloodier than
it was in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   As of Aug. 31, according to Manley, the average NASDAQ stock had
lost 49 percent of its value. In October 1987, the average NASDAQ
stock was down 44.5 percent. This year, the average New York Stock
Exchange stock has fallen 38.4 percent, almost identical to the 39
percent decline of 1987. Only the average S&AMP;P 500 stock has fared
significantly better this year: off 32 percent from its high versus
38.4 percent in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that we have not yet seen the bottom in the
big-name stocks that make up the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Market strategists say that several other factors suggest that
although the bottom may be near, it has not yet been seen. One was
investors' renewed ardor on Tuesday for glamour stocks such as Dell
Computer, Yahoo! and Lucent Technologies, which are trading at
valuations even their fans might call excessive. There's no room
for an earnings disappointment in these companies' share prices.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there is the fear that investors do not yet know
the full extent of the losses sustained by banks, brokerages and
hedge funds in emerging markets and derivatives such as currency
swaps. Although this bad news is trickling out day by day, many big
names have not been heard from. As long as investors are waiting
for these other shoes to drop, the market will remain on edge. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Europe and the United States on Tuesday shunted
aside a call from Japan for an emergency meeting of the world's
largest economies to deal with Russia's economic crisis. At the
same time, leaders in several nations cast about for a fresh
strategy to contain virulent outbreaks of economic instability
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi asked for the meeting in a
telephone call to British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday. But
by the end of the day Tuesday it had been dismissed by German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is fighting a close election campaign
and is distancing himself from years of heavy financial support for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also rejected the Japanese proposal, with some
officials saying it would be counterproductive to gather global
financial leaders at a moment when no one agrees on how to remedy
the global economic contagion whose causes and cures appear more
elusive each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment there is a vacuum in policy, no one has any good
ideas,'' said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist of Primark
Decision Economics, an economic strategy advisory group. ``At the
moment, one cannot see any real turnaround in Asia, Japan is
getting sicker, and Russia was a throw-away of money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The G-7 countries,'' he said, referring to the Group of Seven
nations that historically have taken the lead in global economic
troubles, ``are at a loss for what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials insisted they were
batting around ideas in urgent calls with finance ministers, their
deputies, and political leaders around the world, but were loathe
to discuss them publicly. The problem is complicated by vastly
differing political agendas: Japan, Germany and the United States
are each consumed by domestic political events that have given
their leaders precious little maneuvering room in one of the most
complicated economic environments since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who declared that ``the world
is currently working its way through a difficult period,'' stayed
out of public Tuesday, saying nothing but releasing a letter to
leaders of both parties in Congress urging immediate passage of new
funding for the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Events over the last eight months,'' Rubin wrote, ``not to
mention the last few days and weeks, underscore the impact on the
U.S. economy of developments abroad, including in Asia and Russia.
We simply cannot afford any further delay in providing the IMF with
the resources it requires to help contain the threat of further
financial and political instability around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was in California on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rubin and Greenspan are scheduled to meet with
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and are expected to
press for immediate decisive action by Japan to clean up its
banking system and spur its economy. In recent weeks, hopes that
the new Japanese government would prove more energetic than the
previous one have faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bigger meltdown in Japan is our biggest single nightmare, at
a time when we have plenty of nightmares,'' a senior administration
official said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials speculated that Obuchi asked for a G-7
meeting in order to divert attention away from Japan's problems. If
so, it would be a difficult trick: Japan's economy, and the size of
its problems, so outsize Russia's that investors are focused on the
numbing parliamentary debate in Tokyo even while geostrategists
worry about whether Russia will be able to pay its military or
assemble a new government.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan is hardly the only country suffering from domestic
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin has repeatedly called for $18 billion in funding for
the IMF, President Clinton has discussed the subject only in
passing, and so far has not mounted a major lobbying campaign for
its passage. Administration officials insist that the president is
fully committed to boosting the funding, arguing that the timing is
simply not yet right to begin twisting arms on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats, however, say that the IMF fight may well be the
first test of how much Clinton's powers of persuasion have
diminished since his admission of an inappropriate relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kohl is performing his own political pirouette.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail this week , Kohl defended the West's
strategy of giving Russia billions of dollars in aid in an effort
to turn it into a market economy. ``From a German perspective,
there was no alternative,'' he said, a reference to both Germany's
security concerns and the billions of dollars that German financial
institutions loaned to their Russian counterparts, much of which is
now at risk. ``It was in our elementary interest that Russia finds
its way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said this will be a policy without setbacks,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Kohl who led the movement among European nations to
offer no more aid to Russia after its effective devaluation of its
currency, the ruble, two weeks ago. The IMF has charged that his
decision to hold back greatly worsened Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in cell-phone calls from vacation retreats and
e-mail exchanged by central bankers, ideas are being discussed on
how to calm the world's financial anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   The most common notion is to coordinate the lowering of interest
rates around the world, in hopes of spurring economic growth. But
Japan's interest rates are already at historic lows _ hovering
around 1 percent _ and Japanese companies complain that no bank
will lend them money at any price. The only advantage of a further
cut would be be to signal that the government was interested in
spurring a modest amount of inflation, in hopes it would trigger
spending by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Another experiment being discussed by several nations, but
opposed by the United States, is to place controls on the free
exchange of international currencies, in hopes of preventing
speculators from betting against a country's chances of economic
revival.
</P>
<P>
   But such a move would violate Clinton's repeated calls for
countries to embrace open markets, an appeal he renewed Tuesday in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation, rich or poor, democratic or authoritarian, can
escape the fundamental economic imperatives of the global market,''
he insisted in a speech at Moscow University.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, are trying. Tuesday, Malaysia signaled a complete
break with the open-markets strategy when Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed announced sweeping controls that effectively prevent
investors from converting their holdings in Malayasia into other
currencies, including dollars. The announcement immediately
triggered a run for the exits: The Kuala Lumpur stock market fell
13.3 percent, its biggest decline in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are worried that if Mahathir's experiment in
cutting his economy off from the investors around the world proves
even briefly successful, it could be copied in other nations _ all
of whom are looking for a way to prevent the huge outflow of
international funds that have given markets enormous power over the
policy of governments. Thailand and South Korea probably could not
attempt such a move while under the IMF's tutelage. But Hong Kong
leaders have privately discussed the issue with U.S. officials.

 &HT;    Visiting economist takes it all in at NYSE
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marc Lipson has a front-row seat on one of the most hair-raising
rides around these days _ on the floor of the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big leap from a usually sedate classroom at the
University of Georgia in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Lipson, a finance professor at the Terry College of Business, is
a visiting economist at the NYSE.
</P>
<P>
   For someone who has studied the stock market since he was a
teenager, there probably isn't a better place to be right now. On
Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average moved up nearly 300
points, one of the highest volume days in the exchange's history. A
day earlier, it plunged 512.61 points _ or 6.4 percent _ then, the
second-largest point drop ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first week (I was here), the market went down every day
but one,'' said Lipson, who will be at the NYSE until next June.
``It was the source of many jokes about my effect on the
marketplace.'' ``The first thing that struck me is how orderly it
always is, even when people are very anxious to trade and have a
lot of large orders to fill,'' he said. ``There's some running and
screaming, but that's more the exception than the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he said, the market opened very flat and moved up
steadily during the day. ``Today was more of a normal day with lots
of buyers and sellers. What makes you nervous is when you have a
lot more sellers than buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipson said he has learned a lot already.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to have no expectations about where the market
will be next.''

IN FACE OF VOLATILITY, MARKET LOOKS TOWARD CHICAGO FOR CALM 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ There are few winners in a stock market selloff. But
among those who are managing, and even thriving, in the recent
volatility, are investors and traders who have looked to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   When the market was riding high early last month, with the Dow
Jones industrial average above 9,000, record numbers of investors
began trading heavily in the derivatives market, buying futures and
stock options that would protect their gains against a market
decline.
</P>
<P>
   And when the market's swings reached alarming proportions late
last week, investors _ both individuals and institutions _ piled
into the derivatives markets in Chicago seeking ways to manage
their risk. Hedging, after all, is what Chicago insists its markets
are all about.
</P>
<P>
   With managers of pension assets and mutual funds, as well as
individual investors, flooding Chicago, the city's major exchanges
are thriving. All three exchanges have reported record daily
trading volume on several occasions over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago is the risk-management capital of the world,'' Patrick
Arbor, chairman of the Chicago Board of Trade, said Tuesday. ``No
one does it better in a time of turbulence.''
</P>
<P>
   There are analysts and policy makers who worry about speculators
and momentum traders in Chicago jolting the stock market with swift
moves in and out of stocks and the financial products linked to
them. And some analysts even questioned whether the selloff late
Monday was driven, in part, by arbritragers tied into Chicago's
financial derivatives markets. But for the most part, Chicago has
re-emerged as a central player in the big financial drama.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always that way. After the stock market crashed in
1987, fingers were pointed at Chicago and its financial derivatives
market, with some analysts arguing that program trading and
arbritrage warped the market and intensified volatile selling in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   But chief executives at Chicago's financial exchanges say the
derivatives markets were unfairly singled out then and that no such
hue and cry has followed the past week's market gyrations. Activity
is brisk, they say, and a record number of small investors and
large institutions have warmed to the benefits of managing risk in
the Chicago markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our volume is hitting a record week after week,'' Arbor said.
``The world recognizes that our products help manage risk. In 1987,
people were looking for a scapegoat. But you don't hear that
anymore.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   William Brodsky, chief executive of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange, said the Chicago markets have long been misunderstood.
Although they are separate entities, he said, the derivatives
markets are closely tied to equities trading in New York, often
reflecting and sometimes buffering the buying or selling there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '87 crash was one of the best things that happened to the
Chicago markets,'' Brodsky said. ``It showed that our markets are
closely linked to New York but that the tail doesn't wag the dog.''
</P>
<P>
   At their simplest, derivatives markets can be viewed as similar
to insurance companies that allow investors to pay premiums to
protect themselves in an uncertain market environment. According to
the exchanges, they are places where people can transfer risk for a
cost.
</P>
<P>
   In August, for example, when the market was near its peak, a
record number of investors bought ``put'' options, which give
investors the right _ but do not oblige them _ to sell the
underlying stock or bundle of stocks at a set price. The purchase
of put options, analysts say, might have been an early indication
that share prices were set to tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Investors might have also seen the downturns on Friday and
Monday if they had followed the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's
overnight trading system, Globex, where futures contracts on the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index trade. Many analysts view the S&AMP;P
futures as an indicator of investor sentiment, and on Thursday
night and Friday morning, record trading volume on the system _
almost all of it by institutions _ offered a negative view of
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, trading volume on Globex was heavy once again, and
the S&AMP;P futures prices pointed to higher prices for stocks. When
equities trading opened in New York on Tuesday at 9:30 a.m., prices
slipped briefly, but then recovered as the broader stock market
rebounded from Monday's selloff.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts continue to argue that derivatives trading
adds to overall volatility in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   But whether or not participants in Chicago's markets are simply
managing risk or intensifying it, traders, speculators and savvy
investors say that upcoming twists and turns in the financial
markets are often telegraphed from the trading pits here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago has led the way; it's led the way up and it's led the
way down,'' said H. Jack Bouroudjian, who trades equity index
futures for Nikko Securities in Chicago. ``When there are extremely
volatile times, Chicago is the place people go, it's where mutual
fund managers call. And when people wake up in the morning, where
do they look? At the S&AMP;P futures.''

AS STOCKS REBOUND, TREASURY SECURITIES POST SHARPEST LOSS IN 4
MONTH 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With the stock market having rebounded from Monday's
decline, Treasury securities posted their sharpest loss in more
than four months Tuesday. Volume was heavy, as flows of capital
from equity markets into U.S. government debt eased.
</P>
<P>
   The yield of the 30-year Treasury bond _ the benchmark for
various loans _ moved dramatically higher to 5.34 percent, from
5.25 percent on Monday. And the price, which moves in the opposite
direction, fell 1 17/32 to 102 17/32, or about $15 for each $1,000
of bonds in the hands of investors.
</P>
<P>
   While the decline in bonds was coupled to the rise in stocks, a
falling dollar in world currency trading also weighed on the
market. A weak dollar makes dollar-denominated investments like
Treasuries more attractive to foreign investors because of the
potential gains they could make in currency translation.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
said the National Association of Purchasing Management index for
August, which was released Tuesday, was down slightly, to 49.4. But
more importantly, he said it was under 50 for the third consecutive
month. Less than 50 implies contraction in the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day the yield on a 10-year note was 5.05 percent
and a two-year note was 4.86 percent. Including the 30-year bond,
all the rates were below the 5.5 percent Fed target for the federal
funds rate, known as an inverted yield curve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first sign of a recession at some point in the
horizon,'' Fine said. ``But given the incredibly strong economic
base, it could be 18 months or so before we feel the effects. It's
not in the economic numbers yet, but the inverted yield is probably
the earliest leading indicator of economic duress. And while
recessions do not last as long as expansions, for many it feels
like forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine said he believed the current yield curve suggested a
monetary easing of 50 to 75 basis points. ``However,'' he added,
``it may be a few months before the central bank decides to act.
Certainly if the stock market plummets further it may act sooner.''
A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Since last month's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, market
events have made the Fed's bias toward tightening an anachronism,
Fine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is now likely that, in the minds of the FOMC members, their
bias has been removed in favor of a neutral stance,'' he said.
``However, the Fed will be reluctant to ease until there are
definitive signs of a sustainable slowdown in both consumption and
housing. These signs should appear fairly soon, and thus also point
to the next Fed move as being an ease, but this might not occur for
a few months.''

COSTLY GEWGAWS STILL SELLING AT LUXURY STORES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The $400 ashtrays are still selling at Versace's on
Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. So are the ties, which start at $120.
When customers are spooked by sell-offs in the stock market, sales
of these gewgaws tend to fall off, managers said. After all, even
if one can't live without a $5,000 evening gown, one can put off
the $400 ashtray.
</P>
<P>
   So, while cautiously refraining from any long-term projections
about how a falling market might affect sales, company officials
admitted Tuesday that they were relieved to see the ties and the
ashtrays being rung up and wrapped up at a steady pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to assess any impact, and we're hoping the
market turns around before we do,'' said a Versace spokesman, who
asked to remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of several of the city's luxury retail outposts
were reluctant to say Tuesday whether the volatility of the stock
market had echoed in their stores. They did say that this week
should not be seen as a barometer, because in the last week before
Labor Day, stores were quiet anyway. Idle salespeople at Saks Fifth
Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, Barneys and Gucci looked as if they could
join the lonely Maytag repairman.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, owners, managers and customers of luxury-goods stores
did say that business had been slumping a bit all year because of
the Asian crisis. Most said it was too early to tell if the fall in
the American markets would have an impact on high-end retailers.
But just as a slumping market is a good time to shop for bargain
stocks, it is also a good time to shop for wines, said Bill
Sokolin, the chief executive of D. Sokolin, the wine merchant of
Southampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolin said prices for some of the most expensive wines he
carries have started to come down. A case of Latour '82, a red
bordeaux, would have cost $10,000 a year ago. It can now be had for
$5,500. Haut-Brion '89 has dropped from $7,500 to $3,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``The superbly wealthy are not affected by these changes,''
Sokolin said. ``But some of our just plain wealthy clients are. So
we're taking a little bit of a plastering now, but we made a lot of
money over these past few years. Now we have to give back a bit.''

   PHOENIX - They are centuries old, tightly knit, greatly
misunderstood, and Alberto Pulido is fascinated by them.
</P>
<P>
   Pulido, an assistant professor of religious studies at Arizona
State University West, is in the midst of a long book and video
project on Los Hermanos Penitentes, a lay Catholic religious order
whose chapters dot the landscape of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been writing about the Hispanic and Roman Catholic
traditions since I got started in the academic area in the early
1980s,'' Pulido said. ``I was very intrigued with how Roman
Catholicism was being expressed through the brotherhood in (New
Mexico).''
</P>
<P>
   Los Hermanos Penitentes emerged as a religious order in the late
18th century in isolated northern New Mexico, where clergy were few
and the preservation of religious life and traditions fell to lay
people.
</P>
<P>
   The brotherhood is best known to many for its numerous services
during the season of Lent, and its members have been falsely
labeled as ``flagellants and deviants,'' Pulido said. A flagellant
is a religious zealot who subjects himself to flogging as a sign of
penance.
</P>
<P>
   Pulido has never found evidence of flagellation or zealotry with
his study of the brotherhood, which centered on a small community
of about 25 members near Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, ``the three tenets that strongly underscore
the teachings of the brotherhood are charity, good example and
prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a way of life. It's not institutional religion as
you know it. . . . I think it permeates their everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeding the hungry, tending the sick or any act of charity is a
form of prayer among the brothers, most of whom are farmers or
blue-collar working people.
</P>
<P>
   The brotherhood is a closely knit organization, suspicious of
outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has become quite secretive because of the
sensationalist aspects of the tourists coming in (to the
brotherhood's services) and expecting to see blood all over the
place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pulido's book, to be published by the Smithsonian Institution,
is due out late next year. The video, which will probably run about
two hours, should be completed late this year.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the video, Pulido said, grew out of his
relationship with Juan Sandoval, an elder in Los Hermanos
Penitentes and a skilled woodcarver, who was eager to use the
project to preserve the teachings of the brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   With a grant from ASU, Pulido worked with videographer Roguila
Wolf and Sandoval to create hours of tape on the life of the
brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   Sandoval estimates that there are about 40 communities of the
brotherhood and about 600 to 700 members in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   He praised Pulido's work as an effort to bring out the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message that he conveys to people declares the facts about
our works,'' Sandoval said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People haven't written (accurate) books about us. They write
books to sell. If they were to print the truth about the
brotherhood, what we really do, they wouldn't sell.'' &QL;

   &UR; EDITORS: Bilingualism has become an incendiary political issue, but
The New York Times Syndicate offers some quieter reflections on the
personal and social implications of language in its Hispanic
Heritage Month (Sept. 15-Oct. 15) package. Two articles examine how
assimilation has altered the attitude of many Hispanics toward
their native language and culture. Rounding out the package is a
look at how the GOP is cultivating the Hispanic vote after getting
a shellacking in the 1996 election.

   More and more English is creeping into Spanish-language
television these day. It's a tacit acknowledgement that an
increasingly large percentage of the Hispanic population is heavily
assimilated and speaks English often and well. This trend is also
reflected, Zate notes, in magazines such as the bilingual Latina
and in advertising. (slugged:

   ``I now speak my native language with an accent,'' best-selling
novelist Julia Alvarez declares in this lyrical and touching essay
from her forthcoming book. After Alvarez emigrated from the
Dominican Republic in the 1960s, her English became fluent as her
Spanish become dormant, a reflection of the growing distance
between herself and her native culture. ``It wasn't until I failed
at first love, in Spanish, that I realized how unbridgeable that
gap had become,'' she writes. (slugged:

   In the 1996 presidential race, only 21 percent of the Latino
vote went to GOP candidate Bob Dole. With Hispanics and other
minorities making up an increasingly large percentage of the
electorate, the Republican Party is recognizing the need to win
over a constituency that associates the GOP with English-only,
anti-immigrant policies. One step in this effort is the formation
last year of the New Majority Council. (slugged:

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    While channel surfing on a Sunday night, a familiar face pops up
on the TV screen. It's Giselle Fernandez, former anchor of ``NBC
Nightly News'' and currently anchor of the entertainment show
``Access Hollywood.''
 &HT;    She greets an enthusiastic crowd with the usual pleasantries,
and then slips the phrase ``muy caliente'' into her monologue. She
continues to speak in English and then drops another Spanish word.
She introduces her guest, actress Maria Conchita Alonso.
 &HT;    You check the channel. This isn't ``Access Hollywood.'' The show
is ``Cafe Ole with Giselle Fernandez'' and it's on Galavision, a
Spanish-language cable network.
 &HT;    But she's speaking English. Wait a minute, what's going on here?
 &HT;    Welcome to bilingual television. English-language format and
content are gaining a foothold in a market once occupied solely by
Spanish media. From TV programming to magazines and radio,
bilingual and English-language media continue to grow as a way to
reach the Hispanic market.
 &HT;    Consider recent news items: Emilio Estefan plans to produce a
Latin-themed, English-language TV program for Universal Television
Group.
 &HT;    Latina magazine, a national bilingual women's magazine backed by
the publishers of Essence, switches from quarterly to monthly
distribution.
 &HT;    The Los Angeles Times announces plans to capture more Hispanic
readers, perhaps through a special Hispanic section in English.
 &HT;    In radio, several stations in the top 10 media markets use a
bilingual format with ratings success.
 &HT;    Why this growth in English and bilingual media?
 &HT;    ``It's the next logical step of the evolution of the Latino
population in the U.S.,'' says Alex Nogales, president of the
National Hispanic Media Coalition in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    As immigration laws tighten, and as the second- and
third-generation population increases, marketers and programmers
will focus on capturing the attention of the assimilated and
acculturated Hispanics, he explains.
 &HT;    In fact, the impetus behind Galavision's decision to air
bilingual programming lies in the success of another show that
celebrates assimilation and acculturation. Last year Galavision
began running a weekly half-hour bilingual show called ``Que Pasa
U.S.A.,'' a situation comedy that first aired on PBS in Miami back
in the '70s. The show represents a microcosm of what's happening in
the Hispanic media landscape.
 &HT;    ``Que Pasa U.S.A.'' features a Cuban family, with members from
three generations living under one roof.
 &HT;    ``It's about their experience in trying to retain their culture
and also to assimilate,'' says Michelle Bella, director of
marketing and communications for New York-based Galavision, the
cable network of Univision Communications Inc. in Miami. Galavision
reports that it reaches 7.5 million homes in the United States.
 &HT;    When Galavision first started airing ``Que Pasa U.S.A.,'' the
Nielsen ratings showed that it connected with viewers. This alerted
network executives to try more bilingual programming.
 &HT;    ``Until now, the English-dominant and bilingual crowd has
largely been ignored on TV,'' says producer Jeff Valdez, who along
with partner Bruce Barshop co-manage Si TV, the company that
produces ``Cafe Ole.'' Based in Culver City, Calif., Si TV produces
English-dominant and bilingual programming with Latino appeal.
 &HT;    According to the latest census information on language use at
home, assimilated Hispanics represent about 54 percent of the
Hispanic market. Data from 1990 show that 46 percent of Hispanics
speak Spanish and also speak English ``very well.'' Another 8
percent speak no Spanish. There are 26 percent who speak
predominantly Spanish and don't speak English well or not at all.
The remaining 20 percent say they speak both Spanish and English
``well.''
 &HT;    ``So far, (Hispanic) programming has pulled only from the
Spanish-dominant side,'' Valdez says. The new Galavision fare
creates ``a more competitive programming environment,'' he
believes.
 &HT;    But programming goes beyond language, emphasizes Barshop at Si
TV.
 &HT;    ``It's not just about language. It's also about programming
produced in the U.S.,'' he says. ``Most Spanish-language programs
come from South America and Mexico. Si TV is about recognizing the
cultural difference.''
 &HT;    Coverage of Hispanic culture in English has proven successful
for publishers, as exemplified by the bilingual women's magazine
Latina in New York. Latina publisher Christy Haubegger says she
chose a bilingual format to reflect the assimilated Latina in the
United States. No other magazine addressed the market in this way,
she says.
 &HT;    ``As a second generation Mexican-American who is bilingual,
reading in Spanish is very difficult,'' she says. ``And the
magazines published in Latin America don't relate to my life here
in the U.S.''
 &HT;    Thousands of women appear to share Ms. Haubegger's perceptions.
Latina debuted in May 1996 as a quarterly and this year changed to
monthly distribution. The magazine reports an unaudited circulation
of 300,000. According to Ms. Haubegger, Latina has attracted
high-end advertisers that previously had never placed ads in
Hispanic media.
 &HT;    ``We are the only Hispanic advertising that Ralph Lauren has
ever done, and that the Gap and Tommy Hilfiger has ever done,'' she
says.
 &HT;    Latina illustrates the growing support among advertisers for
English-language Hispanic media. However, many Hispanic advertising
agencies feel threatened by the use of English in the Hispanic
market. But the agencies created this problem in the first place,
says Nogales at the National Hispanic Media Coalition.
 &HT;    ``For years these agencies have been telling advertisers that
they will deliver the Latino market. And they've been telling
clients the only way to do it is to reach them in Spanish,'' he
says. ``They decided to put everything into the Spanish-speaking
game and now they're reaping what they sowed. These agencies are
going the way of the dinosaurs.''
 &HT;    The advertiser's message, including its language, must fit the
target audience.
 &HT;    Levi's, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer, launched
its first bilingual ads this summer for its jeans. Created by
Bromley, Aguilar &AMP; Associates in San Antonio, the ads, which ran on
Univision and Telemundo in Los Angeles and Houston, feature young
Hispanics who speak mostly Spanish with some English.
 &HT;    Michelle Vasquez, marketing manager at Levi's, says research
showed bilingual ads were the best way to reach the product's
target market _ young males ages 15 to 25.
 &HT;    ``We looked at the census data and found that 74 percent of this
group are bilingual,'' she says.
 &HT;    Despite an increase in English media that targets Hispanics,
Spanish-language advertising will continue to keep growing, says
Alejandro Ruelas, director of ethnic marketing at Anheuser-Busch in
St. Louis.
 &HT;    ``I think the political climate and the anti-Hispanic
initiatives out there will instill more pride in our people and
ultimately bring us back to our language,'' he says. ``There's the
growth of retro acculturation where a lot of Hispanics are making
an active effort to learn Spanish and consume Spanish-language
media. The Spanish language is here for the long haul and it will
continue to grow by leaps and bounds.''
 &HT;    So far, broadcast heavyweights Univision and Telemundo don't
perceive a threat on the language front. In fact, Univision
recently asked McDonald's to re-edit its latest TV commercial
``English Lessons'' for the air. The spot contained too much
English dialogue.
 &HT;    Univision accepts only all-Spanish advertising, says a company
spokeswoman in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``Our success comes from ads and programs being 100 percent
Spanish. Our viewers keep coming back because they are most
comfortable with that programming,'' she says.
 &HT;    At least one man is confident that Hispanics welcome culturally
relevant English media.
 &HT;    ``I've been getting (negative) comments about the viability of
targeting this market since the beginning,'' says Valdez at Si TV.
 &HT;    ``I say to those people, `Laugh all you want to now, but the
times, they are a-changing.'''

 By JULIA ALVAREZ  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 Excerpted from ``Something to Declare,'' published by Algonquin
Books  
 &HT;    The inevitable, of course, has happened. I now speak my native
language ``with an accent.'' What I mean by this is that I speak
perfect childhood Spanish, but if I stray into a heated discussion
or complex explanation, I have to ask, ``Por favor, puedo decirlo
en ingles?'' Can I please say it in English?
 &HT;    How and why did this happen?
 &HT;    When we emigrated to the United States from the Dominican
Republic in the early 1960s, the climate was not favorable for
retaining our Spanish. I remember one scene in a grocery store soon
after we arrived. An elderly shopper, overhearing my mother
speaking Spanish to her daughters, muttered that if we wanted to be
in this country, we should learn the language.
 &HT;    ``I do know the language,'' my mother said in her
boarding-school English, putting the woman in her place. She knew
the value of speaking perfect English. She had studied for several
years at Abbot Academy, flying up from the island to New York City,
and then taking the train to Boston.
 &HT;    At school, there were several incidents of name-calling and
stone-throwing, which our teachers claimed would stop if my sisters
and I joined in with the other kids and quit congregating together
at recess and jabbering away in Spanish. Those were the days before
bilingual education or multicultural studies _ when kids like us
were thrown in the deep end of the public school pool and left to
fend for ourselves. Not everyone came up for air.
 &HT;    Mami managed to get us scholarships to her old boarding school
where good manners and tolerance and English skills were required.
We were also all required to study a foreign language, but my
teachers talked me into taking French. In fact, they felt my
studying Spanish was equivalent to my taking a ``gut course.''
Spanish was my native tongue, after all, a language I already had
in the bag and would always be able to speak whenever I wanted.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, with Saturday drills and daily writing assignments,
our English skills soon met school requirements. By the time my
sisters and I came home for vacations, we were rolling our eyes in
exasperation at our old-world Mami and Papi, using expressions like
``far out,'' and ``what a riot!'' and ``outta sight'' and ``believe
you me'' as if we had been born to them.
 &HT;    As rebellious adolescents, we soon figured out that conducting
our filial business in English gave us an edge over our strict,
Spanish-speaking parents. We could spin circles around my mother's
``absolutamente no'' by pointing out the flaws in her arguments, in
English.
 &HT;    My father was a pushover for pithy quotes from Shakespeare, and
a recitation of ``the quality of mercy is not strained'' could
usually get me what I wanted.
 &HT;    Usually. There were areas we couldn't touch even with a
Shakespearean 10-foot pole _ the area of boys and permission to go
places where there might be boys, American boys, with their mouths
full of bubblegum and their minds full of the devil.
 &HT;    Our growing distance from Spanish was a way in which we were
setting ourselves free from that old world where, as girls, we
didn't have much say about what we could do with our lives. In
English, we didn't have to use the formal ``usted'' that
immediately put us in our place with our elders. We were
responsible for ourselves and that made us feel grown-up.
 &HT;    We couldn't just skirt culpability by using the reflexive: The
bag of cookies did not finish itself, nor did the money disappear
itself from Mami's purse. We had no one to bail us out of American
trouble once we went our own way in English. No family connections,
no tio (uncle) whose name might open doors for us.
 &HT;    If the world was suddenly less friendly, it was also more
exciting. We found out we could do things we had never done before.
We could go places in English we never could in Spanish, if we put
our minds to it. And my sisters and I put our combined four minds
to it, believe you me.
 &HT;    My parents, anxious that we not lose our tie to our native land,
and no doubt thinking of future husbands for their four daughters,
began sending us ``home'' to the Dominican Republic every summer to
Mami's family in the capital.
 &HT;    And just as we had once huddled in the school playground,
speaking Spanish for the comfort of it, my sisters and I now hung
out together in ``the D.R.,'' as we referred to it, kibitzing in
English on the crazy world around us, the silly rules for girls,
the obnoxious behavior of macho guys, the deplorable situation of
the poor.
 &HT;    My aunts and uncles tried unsuccessfully to stem this tide of
our Americanization, whose main expression was, of course, our use
of the English language.
 &HT;    ``Tienen que hablar en espanol,'' they commanded. ``Ay, come
on,'' we would say as if we had been asked to go back to baby talk
as grown-ups.
 &HT;    By now, we couldn't go back as easily as that. Our Spanish was
full of English. Countless times during a conversation, we were
corrected, until what we had to say was lost in our saying it
wrong. More and more we chose to answer in English even when the
question was posed in Spanish.
 &HT;    It was a measure of the growing distance between ourselves and
our native culture _ a distance we all felt we could easily retrace
with just a little practice. It wasn't until I failed at first
love, in Spanish, that I realized how unbridgeable that gap had
become.
 &HT;    He was a honey-skinned young man with wonderful dimples and a
pot belly that made him look like a Dominican version of the
Pillsbury doughboy. His name was Manuel Gustavo, but I
affectionately nicknamed him Mangu, after a mashed plantain dish
that is a staple of Dominican diet.
 &HT;    A few days after meeting him, Mangu's mother sent over an
elaborate dessert with lots of white frosting that looked
suggestively like a wedding cake.
 &HT;    When I tried to talk to Mangu about something of substance, the
conversation foundered. I couldn't carry on in Spanish about
complicated subjects, and Mangu didn't know a word of English. Our
silences troubled me. Maybe, my aunts were right. Too much
education in English could spoil a girl's chances in Spanish.
 &HT;    Evenings, Mangu would come over, and we'd sit on the patio and
try to make conversation or drive out to the country club in his
father's car to dance merengue and see what everyone else was
doing. What we were doing was looking for people to fill up our
silence with their talk.
 &HT;    I never had a Spanish-only boyfriend again. Maybe the
opportunity never presented itself, or maybe it was that as English
became my dominant tongue, too many parts of me were left out in
Spanish for me to be able to be intimate with a potential life
partner in only that language.
 &HT;    Still, the yearning remained. How wonderful to love someone
whose skin was the same honey-dipped, sallow-based color, who said
``concho'' when he was mad and ``cielito lindo'' when he wanted to
butter you up!
 &HT;    ``Ay, to make love in Spanish ...'' the Latina narrator of
Sandra Cisneros' story ``Bien Pretty'' exclaims. ``To have a lover
... whisper things in that language crooned to babies, that
language murmured by grandmothers, those words that smelled like
your house.''
 &HT;    But I wonder if after the Latina protagonist makes love with her
novio, she doesn't sit up in bed and tell him the story of her life
in English with a few palabritas thrown in to capture the rhythm of
her Latin heartbeat?

<P>
   On Sept. 16, 1997, a group of Republicans met in a conference
room at the Marriott Hotel in downtown Washington, D.C., to launch
the party's latest program to enlist minorities. The meeting ended
on an upbeat note, but it had started with a lot of soul-searching
and apologies.
</P>
<P>
   The sense was that Republicans were running out of chances with
Latino voters. This time they vowed they would get it right.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the hosts _ Republican National Committee chair Jim
Nicholson and co-chair Patricia Harrison _ the attendees included
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Sen. Ben Knighthorse Campbell
(R-Colo.), Rep. Henry Bonilla (R-Texas), Rep. J. C. Watts (R-Okla.)
and some prominent minority Republicans who had been enlisted to
lead the new charge.
</P>
<P>
   It had been almost a year since the Republicans had received one
of their worst thrashings from the Democrats in the presidential
elections. The Latino vote had flexed its muscle in almost total
repudiation of the Republican presidential candidate and platform.
</P>
<P>
   Months later some Latino communities still rankled with
anti-Republican sentiment. Warning signs flashed all over the
Republican domain.
</P>
<P>
   An unsolicited report prepared by Republican pollster Frank Lunt
stated, ``Our majority is at stake. Republicans barely maintained
their congressional majority in 1996, and a major reason their
support dropped from 1994 was the utter collapse of the Hispanic
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``The Hispanic vote is up for grabs, and
it is up to individual Republican candidates to say in plain
English and prove by their actions that they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   Party strategist Stu Spencer, in a memo to California GOP
leaders, warned that they would be committing ``political suicide''
if they continued to alienate Hispanics instead of courting what
many party philosophers contend are natural allies.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Hispanic disenchantment, Spencer added, ``The trend is
obvious, and the political danger is real. We are dramatically
losing market share of the fastest growing segment of the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC is concerned about its political standing with Hispanics
but not necessarily impressed with the Luntz and Spencer
appraisals, which an RNC spokesperson considered exaggerated and
overly alarmist.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, if such ominous warnings sound like Chicken Little
to some, the party leaders now seem to accept that the sky could
fall on them if they don't move more decisively and intelligently
to rebuild their minority constituency, particularly Hispanics, to
the heights of the Nixon and Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   Banking on a new vehicle to attract minorities to the party, the
GOP unveiled the New Majority Council at the September meeting. It
sounds and looks a bit like Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition,
encompassing Hispanics, African Americans, Asian Americans and
Native Americans in a collegial effort with the emphasis on the
word ``majority,'' which the Republicans say foretells the future
status of the ethnic electorate.
</P>
<P>
   On the Hispanic side, statistics tell it better. Today's U.S.
population is 72.5 percent non-Hispanic white and 27.5 percent
minority, with Hispanics making up 11 percent. According to the
U.S. Census, within 50 years the adult population will transform
into 52.8 percent non-Hispanic white and 47.2 percent minority,
with Hispanics making up 24.5 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   RNC co-chair Harrison says, ``We have to stop minority thinking
because we are now talking about a new majority. It's up to us to
move toward people we want at the table and not up to the people to
find the table.''
</P>
<P>
   She credits the late Lee Atwater, the former RNC chairman and
premier political swami, as the originator of this idea. Atwater
was developing what he called the ``big tent'' for the Republicans
at the time of his death, and Harrison says she is just building on
this concept.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the NMC will achieve its goal is another matter. The
council's message of ``heritage, hope and opportunity'' is not
exactly revolutionary, and it relies on the GOP's basic planks of
family values, quality education, crimefighting, entrepreneurship
and less government.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bonilla, who is emerging as the Republicans' Latino star,
says Latinos, by virtue of their culture and values, are ready-made
Republicans, but the party has been slow to mine this bountiful
lode of voters. He credits his own success to dogged community
outreach.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla is a three-term Republican congressman from an area long
known as a Democratic power base. He was the first Latino
Republican congressman elected from Texas, and he has won each
contest with 60 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla attributes his success to delivering the right message _
the Republican message, not a specially crafted Hispanic one _
personally to his constituents and listening to their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to show up at these communities as I do,'' he says.
``I try to get this across to our people, but it's the hardest
thing to make them understand that it's not hard to do and that we
don't have to change our message or our values.''
</P>
<P>
   To start making inroads with Hispanics, the GOP must overcome a
notoriously bad reputation of late for antagonizing Hispanics. The
Republicans are also known for constantly shooting themselves in
the foot on Latino sensitivities.
</P>
<P>
   The Pete Wilsons and Bob Dornans of the party don't help.
Neither do the issues of immigration, affirmative action and
English-only, all attributed to Republican politics.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential campaign, the Republican candidate, Bob
Dole, practically ignored the Hispanic constituency. Latinos
responded in kind by helping Clinton clobber him, delivering 72
percent of the Latino vote to the president. Hispanics nationwide
voted 21 percent for Dole, the lowest support among Hispanics for
any presidential candidate in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic congressional candidates also got 72 percent of the
Hispanic vote.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans contend that the Dole shellacking was an aberration.
They insist that better measures of Republican-Latino affinity are
Richard Nixon, the first candidate to seriously court the Latino
vote, and the Great Communicator, Ronald Reagan, still a hero to
many Latinos. Both won the Hispanic vote by large margins,
generating the largest Latino turnouts in a presidential election
up to now.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists point out that Latinos will respond to
the right message and messenger. They cite mayoral races in two
cities with large Hispanic populations.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani received 40 percent of the
Hispanic vote, and Richard Riordan of Los Angeles got 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is building a
large Hispanic following that supporters are confident will
mushroom into a national constituency if he decides to run for
president.
</P>
<P>
   If Democrats have dominated the Latino constituency, it is
largely because they are better _ a lot better _ at exploiting the
issues and playing to Latino emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latinos have no problem with voting Republican,'' says Arturo
Vargas, executive director of the National Association of Latino
Elected Officials Educational Fund, which counts 5,400 members.
``They have shown it in the past, like in l984, when they gave
Reagan over 40 percent of their vote. It means the Republican Party
has the potential to attract Latinos. The Republicans have to
examine what has succeeded and what has driven Latinos away.''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Willie C. Velasquez
Institute, suggests that the GOP was punished in 1996 by Latino
voters for its so-called extremist positions, but it doesn't mean
that Latinos have banished it forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``1998 will be the measure of whether this is a long-term trend;
I don't think it is,'' he says. ``The issues will not be the same,
and if you examine the polling trends, many Latinos consider
themselves undecided or independent.''
</P>
<P>
   A Tomas Rivera Policy Institute poll that asked if Latino voters
``lean'' toward Democrats, Republicans or ``neither way,'' 64
percent in California, 67 percent in Florida and 69 percent in
Texas gave the last answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans and their NMC are aware of Latino voting
tendencies by now, but since gaining a majority in Congress in
1994, Republicans have provided proof for critics who say the party
is anti-Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Every bit of English-only legislation was sponsored by a
Republican, and welfare and immigration reforms were spearheaded by
Republicans. If the Republican Party can acknowledge past mistakes
and make an honest effort to win Latinos to its style of
government, it's in for better times.
</P>
<P>
   If it fails once again, the consequences will again be
self-inflicted, and, many predict, long-lasting.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Europe and the United States on Tuesday shunted
aside a call from Japan for an emergency meeting of the world's
largest economies to deal with Russia's economic crisis. At the
same time, leaders in several nations cast about for a fresh
strategy to contain virulent outbreaks of economic instability
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi asked for the meeting in a
telephone call to British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday. But
by the end of the day Tuesday it had been dismissed by German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is fighting a close election campaign
and is distancing himself from years of heavy financial support for
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also rejected the Japanese proposal, with some
officials saying it would be counterproductive to gather global
financial leaders at a moment when no one agrees on how to remedy
the global economic contagion whose causes and cures appear more
elusive each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment there is a vacuum in policy, no one has any good
ideas,'' said Allen Sinai, the chief global economist of Primark
Decision Economics, an economic strategy advisory group. ``At the
moment, one cannot see any real turnaround in Asia, Japan is
getting sicker, and Russia was a throw-away of money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The G-7 countries,'' he said, referring to the Group of Seven
nations that historically have taken the lead in global economic
troubles, ``are at a loss for what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials insisted they were
batting around ideas in urgent calls with finance ministers, their
deputies, and political leaders around the world, but were loathe
to discuss them publicly. The problem is complicated by vastly
differing political agendas: Japan, Germany and the United States
are each consumed by domestic political events that have given
their leaders precious little maneuvering room in one of the most
complicated economic environments since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who declared that ``the world
is currently working its way through a difficult period,'' stayed
out of public Tuesday, saying nothing but releasing a letter to
leaders of both parties in Congress urging immediate passage of new
funding for the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``Events over the last eight months,'' Rubin wrote, ``not to
mention the last few days and weeks, underscore the impact on the
U.S. economy of developments abroad, including in Asia and Russia.
We simply cannot afford any further delay in providing the IMF with
the resources it requires to help contain the threat of further
financial and political instability around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was in California on
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rubin and Greenspan are scheduled to meet with
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, and are expected to
press for immediate decisive action by Japan to clean up its
banking system and spur its economy. In recent weeks, hopes that
the new Japanese government would prove more energetic than the
previous one have faded.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bigger meltdown in Japan is our biggest single nightmare, at
a time when we have plenty of nightmares,'' a senior administration
official said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Some U.S. officials speculated that Obuchi asked for a G-7
meeting in order to divert attention away from Japan's problems. If
so, it would be a difficult trick: Japan's economy, and the size of
its problems, so outsize Russia's that investors are focused on the
numbing parliamentary debate in Tokyo even while geostrategists
worry about whether Russia will be able to pay its military or
assemble a new government.
</P>
<P>
   But Japan is hardly the only country suffering from domestic
paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   While Rubin has repeatedly called for $18 billion in funding for
the IMF, President Clinton has discussed the subject only in
passing, and so far has not mounted a major lobbying campaign for
its passage. Administration officials insist that the president is
fully committed to boosting the funding, arguing that the timing is
simply not yet right to begin twisting arms on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats, however, say that the IMF fight may well be the
first test of how much Clinton's powers of persuasion have
diminished since his admission of an inappropriate relationship
with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kohl is performing his own political pirouette.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail this week , Kohl defended the West's
strategy of giving Russia billions of dollars in aid in an effort
to turn it into a market economy. ``From a German perspective,
there was no alternative,'' he said, a reference to both Germany's
security concerns and the billions of dollars that German financial
institutions loaned to their Russian counterparts, much of which is
now at risk. ``It was in our elementary interest that Russia finds
its way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said this will be a policy without setbacks,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Kohl who led the movement among European nations to
offer no more aid to Russia after its effective devaluation of its
currency, the ruble, two weeks ago. The IMF has charged that his
decision to hold back greatly worsened Russia's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in cell-phone calls from vacation retreats and
e-mail exchanged by central bankers, ideas are being discussed on
how to calm the world's financial anxieties.
</P>
<P>
   The most common notion is to coordinate the lowering of interest
rates around the world, in hopes of spurring economic growth. But
Japan's interest rates are already at historic lows _ hovering
around 1 percent _ and Japanese companies complain that no bank
will lend them money at any price. The only advantage of a further
cut would be be to signal that the government was interested in
spurring a modest amount of inflation, in hopes it would trigger
spending by consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Another experiment being discussed by several nations, but
opposed by the United States, is to place controls on the free
exchange of international currencies, in hopes of preventing
speculators from betting against a country's chances of economic
revival.
</P>
<P>
   But such a move would violate Clinton's repeated calls for
countries to embrace open markets, an appeal he renewed Tuesday in
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No nation, rich or poor, democratic or authoritarian, can
escape the fundamental economic imperatives of the global market,''
he insisted in a speech at Moscow University.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, are trying. Tuesday, Malaysia signaled a complete
break with the open-markets strategy when Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohammed announced sweeping controls that effectively prevent
investors from converting their holdings in Malayasia into other
currencies, including dollars. The announcement immediately
triggered a run for the exits: The Kuala Lumpur stock market fell
13.3 percent, its biggest decline in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials are worried that if Mahathir's experiment in
cutting his economy off from the investors around the world proves
even briefly successful, it could be copied in other nations _ all
of whom are looking for a way to prevent the huge outflow of
international funds that have given markets enormous power over the
policy of governments. Thailand and South Korea probably could not
attempt such a move while under the IMF's tutelage. But Hong Kong
leaders have privately discussed the issue with U.S. officials.

A SUMMIT CONFERENCE THAT APPROACHES SELF-PARODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ As President and Mrs. Clinton prepared to retire
Tuesday night at the Marriott Hotel near the banks of the Moscow
River, a car pulled over not far from the hotel entrance. The doors
opened, and Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultranationalist who controls
a bloc of seats in Russia's parliament, climbed out.
</P>
<P>
   Zhirinovsky turned toward the hotel and yelled, in so many
exceptionally unprintable words, ``Clinton, you are an idiot!''
After applying the coarsest description of sexual relations to the
president, he added, ``Your dollar is dirt, and this dirt is all
over the world!''
</P>
<P>
   He then produced a dollar in his hand and told his supporters,
``Burn it.'' They did.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, Moscow television broadcast videotape of the
event in its entirety, barely-bleeped epithets and all.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of disgrace would never have happened if Leonid
Brezhnev still ran things. But Brezhnev and the Soviet Union are
dead, Boris Yeltsin is alive and, by several accounts still
kicking, and U.S.-Russian summitry _ still somber and inflated as
ever _ now teeters at times on the slippery brink of self-parody.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on one's point of view, Moscow right now is either no
place for such a worldly event or the perfect place.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts between old-style superpower summitry and the
current state of the two old superpowers _ and their leaders _ is
simply too great to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The public aspects of this summit meeting have been scripted
almost entirely for television; some events, such as a
wreath-laying in Red Square this morning, were staged solely for
cameras and a small pool of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin dutifully mugged for the cameras all day
like devoted friends, exchanging bear hugs, gifts and tributes to
the enduring friendship of their nations at almost every public
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, looking reasonably hale, good-naturedly stiffed news
photographers by turning his back on them during one ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, ever gregarious, practiced staff-written
Russian-language platitudes on crowds all day. Beyond the range of
the lens, however, the economy is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clintons and the Yeltsins and some 115 other luminaries
dined in the Kremlin on Tuesday night on pike rasstegai, salmon,
roast-beef-stuffed omelet and the obligatory wine and caviar,
Muscovites a few blocks away were resting after a day of
methodically picking grocery shelves clean of food and dry goods
they fully expect will soon disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow newspapers reported Tuesday that ships loaded with
imported goods, now a huge share of Russian purchases, were turning
away or refusing to unload because of the fiscal uncertainty.
Non-perishables like grain, oils and, in St. Petersburg,
refrigerators were vanishing from stores, and prices in some
instances had reportedly doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic-quality runners, fearful of being injured in a coup,
threatened to desert a world-class track meet this weekend. The
Russian Olympic Committee was hampered in responding, because its
electricity had been turned off for nonpayment.
</P>
<P>
   And that was merely the Russian side of the economic equation.
Moments after Clinton finished cutting a fat loaf of Russian bread
Tuesday morning in Yeltsin's marble-and-bronze Kremlin study, the
two men were jerked back to reality by a CBS News correspondent who
suddenly asked: What about the economy?
</P>
<P>
   The correspondent, Scott Pelley, was seeking a response from
Clinton about Monday's 500-point drop in the stock market. But the
question could just as easily have been asked of Yeltsin, whose
nation's own stock market has shed 60 per cent of its blue-chips'
value in the last two months alone.
</P>
<P>
   Pelley was escorted from the room by Russian officials and
briefly stripped of his press credentials for breaking a promise to
be silent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As Zhirinovsky demonstrated, the respect usually accorded to
summit-conference participants has gone largely by the boards this
week.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton played a decided second Tuesday to Naina Yeltsin as
the two toured a factory, and Mrs. Yeltsin decried the lack of
women's roles in business. Mrs. Clinton was even asked point-blank
about her outlook in the wake of the president's admission that he
carried on a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky inside the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting along fine,'' Mrs. Clinton responded;
reporters later analyzed her body language and facial expressions
during a joint appearance with Clinton at a Russian public school.
Clinton also suffered his share of slings. In downtown Moscow, a
British manager of a fine-arts reproduction company was selling a
special edition of Russian nesting dolls, featuring the likenesses
of Clinton, Ms. Lewinsky and three other women with whom he has
been said to have had _ or tried to have _ some involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, David Segal, said the $35 dolls, made of linden and
hand-painted, ``are being produced as fast as the people can get
the stock for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Segal said he was merely doing his part for the Russian economy.
``We're going to have most of one village turning them out,'' he
said in an interview this week.

 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market Tuesday regained more than half of
the value it lost on Monday as trading volume set a new record.
</P>
<P>
   Traders and stock-market analysts said that big institutions,
like pension funds and insurance companies, took the lead in
Tuesday's buying, picking through big and small stocks that had
been leveled by Monday's selloff.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 288.36 points, or 3.8
percent, to 7827.43, essentially retracing the 250-point plunge
that came in the frantic last half-hour of trading on Monday. That
selloff, which market participants traced to an unusual confluence
of events, pushed the bellwether stock index down to a decline of
6.4 percent for the day. After Tuesday's rebound, the Dow index
remains 16.2 percent below its high, reached in July, and about 1
percent below where it started the year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's gain was the second largest ever in points, after a
337-point jump in the Dow on Oct. 28 of last year. In percentage
terms, however, it ranked far down the list. Volume on the New York
Stock Exchange set a record, with 1.21 billion shares changing
hands, as nearly two stocks rose for every one that declined.
</P>
<P>
   In jumping into the market Tuesday, investors sought out
companies whose recent declines seemed to ignore what are still
good prospects for earnings growth for the rest of the year. The
buying followed a turbulent opening, during which the Dow rose
sharply, then fell as much as 139 points below Monday's close, all
in the first hour of trading. Then stocks started a climb of more
than 400 points as measured by the Dow and closed near their
highest point of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But several market participants warned that economic
uncertainties continue to plague overseas markets and could keep
pressure on the U.S. stock market through the autumn.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday, there were three sellers for every buyer,'' said
Michael Clark, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston
who oversees the firm's U.S. equity trading. Such an order
imbalance is only remedied when prices fall enough to reduce the
number of sellers or attract more buyers. ``Today, people were
willing to look for values.''
</P>
<P>
   They did so, however, with some caution. ``I think most people
have one foot back in the water now, but not two,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   Several of Wall Street's top investment strategists voiced their
beliefs that the American economy remains strong and that Monday's
stock market decline went too far too fast, just as they had
following previous sharp market declines, including the 7.2 percent
decline in the Dow industrials last Oct. 27.
</P>
<P>
   And some even told investors to increase their bets. Abby Joseph
Cohen, the steadfastly bullish strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.,
told investors that they should increase their holdings of equities
to 72 percent of assets from her previous recommendation of 65
percent, and that cash holdings should be reduced to zero from a
previous level of 5 percent. The remainder of investors' portfolio
should consist of 25 percent in fixed-income securities and 3
percent in commodities, down from a previous level of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the biggest gains Tuesday came in stocks that were hit
the hardest on Monday, including shares of technology companies
like Dell Computer, Cisco Systems and Microsoft. The Nasdaq
composite index, which is heavily weighted with high-tech shares,
rose nearly 76 points, or 5.1 percent, to 1575.09. On Monday, the
index fell 8.6 percent. Nasdaq volume Tuesday was a heavy 1.25
billion shares, second only to last Oct. 28 when it was 1.35
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Also gaining Tuesday was the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which
rose almost 37 points, or 3.9 percent, to 994.26. Despite a decline
of 6.8 percent on Monday, Tuesday's gain put the S&AMP;P 500 nearly 2.5
percent above where it started the year. And the Russell 2000
index, a small-stock measure that has been the hardest hit this
year, rose 3 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   With their heavy buying Tuesday, investors seemed to be saying
that Monday's late-afternoon selloff overstated the possible
negative effects faced by American companies. Market participants
said that a variety of factors contributed to the selloff, which
from 3:30 to 4 p.m. lopped 250 points off the Dow industrials.
</P>
<P>
   That last half hour of trading appeared to be driven in part by
sophisticated trading strategies, including index arbitrage, a
technique that involves trading futures contracts based on the the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index as well as the 500 individual stocks
that make up the index.
</P>
<P>
   The futures contract and the cumulative value of the stocks in
the index usually are worth roughly the same amount. But sometimes
in volatile markets a gap opens up between their prices, and
traders can try to lock in the difference as profit by selling the
more expensive item and buying the cheaper one.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the futures prices, driven by an overwhelmingly
negative market psychology throughout the day, fell far more
sharply than did stock prices. Seeing that, some traders bought the
futures and then sold the individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As they did so, several other types of sellers were also lining
up at the door. Mutual funds also were trying to complete sell
orders that they had placed earlier in the day, equity traders
said. The funds appeared to be seeking to lighten their holdings of
stocks in part to pay off shareholder redemptions but also simply
to raise cash in their portfolios, which would help them to avoid
further market declines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Monday was the last day of August. In a note to
clients, Ms. Cohen of Goldman Sachs noted that month-end pressures
to meet margin requirements may have played a role in Monday's
decline.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The combined effect of that selling caused any possible buyers
to step away, traders said. ``Buyers simply took a holiday,'' said
said Robert Fagenson, a specialist at the New York Stock Exchange
firm of Fagenson Frankel &AMP; Streicher, who also serves as a vice
chairman of the New York Stock Exchange. ``They looked around and
said whatever they wanted to buy, they would tomorrow at a lower
price.''
</P>
<P>
   After realizing that some of the reasons for Monday's decline
were fleeting rather than permanent, investors and traders returned
to the stock market Tuesday determined to look for stocks to buy,
resulting in the big rally.
</P>
<P>
   All of the stock market's signs were not positive, however, and
many of those who breathed a sigh of relief after Tuesday's rally
acknowledged that more turbulence could lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Collins, head of trading at Daiwa Securities America,
noted that the stocks of many banks and financial-service companies
did not participate in Tuesday's rally, perhaps because investors
are worried about further losses from the recent downturn in global
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, shares of some financial companies have been battered
recently. Bankers Trust, which Tuesday announced it expects to
report a third-quarter loss because of trading losses, saw its
stock fall $1 3/16 to $73.125 Tuesday, about half the price it
traded for in April.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Citicorp and Travelers Group, which are scheduled to
merge later this year, also both fell Tuesday. After the close of
trading, Citicorp announced that losses from holdings of Russian
securities will reduce its third quarter net income by $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   Investors might be warranted in expressing some continued
caution as September begins, if only because this is traditionally
the stock market's worst month.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason, market analysts say, is because corporate
executives and boards of directors in the fall turn their attention
to budgets for the coming year and reassess the business outlook.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly could be the case this fall, especially when
companies already appear to be thinking twice about new spending
programs, said Albert Wojnilower, a New York economist. ``So many
decisions companies make these days are premised by what effect it
will have on their stock price,'' Wojnilower said. ``When boards
come back and meet after Labor Day, I think they will take a more
cautious view on things.''

 SLAM-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Daphne Gottlieb strolled across the stage of the
Alamo Drafthouse to the microphone, wearing a blond buzz cut, huge
hoop earrings and a dress that looked like a slip.
</P>
<P>
   The raucous crowd quieted down, and she launched into a poem
about a barfly's unsuccessful attempts to convert her from a
lesbian into his, uh, romantic partner, at least for one night. She
delivered it with humor and, one gathered from the clarity of the
observations, much truth. The crowd roared with laughter and
approval. It was an impressive performance.
</P>
<P>
   But was it poetry?
</P>
<P>
   That's not just an idle question. Certainly not at the time _ I
was a randomly selected judge in a preliminary bout at the 1998
National Poetry Slam that ran Aug. 19-22, and I had to rate
Gottlieb's performance.
</P>
<P>
   I would search for the answer to the question for four days. But
now the crowd was antsy and the emcee was impatient _ immediate
response is what they're after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judges, hold up your scores.''
</P>
<P>
   I gave her an 8.8. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Electric Lounge is a grungy little club, perfect for seeing
bands and poetry slams and on this Wednesday, Aug. 19, the Opening
Ceremonies. The nearly 200 poets in town for the slam gathered
there, introducing themselves with either a quick performance or,
for individual competitors, a haiku. Two water-gun-toting women
dressed like the Jetsons at the beach doused anyone who went on too
long.
</P>
<P>
   It was an eclectic crowd, the usual weird haircuts and goatees
the size of bath mats alongside people who looked like they were on
lunch break from a downtown office. It was as if a bus carrying a
bunch of Nine Inch Nails fans had collided with a van full of high
school English teachers, and they all decided to mill about while
sorting things out.
</P>
<P>
   Wammo, a musician-poet-local legend, kicked things off with
important information: an explanation of when beer and liquor sales
would be halted each night. The poets learned the slam's mantra _
that no matter how cheated you may feel, remember the following
four words: ``It's a (expletive) slam!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Marc Smith, who invented poetry slams 11 years ago,
talked about his creation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, the poetry world shunned performance,'' said
Smith, who used to work in construction and home repair. Slams have
spread slowly throughout the nation since, until any good-size city
boasts a coffeehouse or music venue that devotes a night to poets
performing their work.
</P>
<P>
   As slams grew, so did the quality of the poetry and performances
_ this, the ninth annual national slam, was the largest ever. Smith
was clearly pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew if you were going to be on a stage,'' Smith said,
``don't be boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, an intense, bald, squat, heavily tattooed poet from
Houston who called himself the Rev. Bart was explaining onstage how
he had done jail time for assault with grievous bodily injury. He
wore a black T-shirt that said ``Napalm: Because immolation is the
sincerest form of flattery.''
</P>
<P>
   This was going to be fun. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the national slam is a great place to find
yourself in almost surreal situations. For instance, I found myself
in a club called Twist, watching the team from Mesa, Ariz., in the
preliminary bouts and standing beside Molly Ivins, the great
columnist from Austin, and Patricia Smith. Yes, (begin ital) that
(endital) Patricia Smith, the former ``Boston Globe'' columnist who
was fired when it was discovered that she had fabricated columns.
</P>
<P>
   In the slam world, Smith is nothing less than a legend, by
virtue of her intense, expert performances and string of four
consecutive individual championships. She didn't enter this year,
but was a constant presence, well-loved, and served as an emcee at
several bouts.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, poems in poetry slams are judged half for the poem
itself and half for the performance _ a balance I quickly began to
question and, later, doubt. A far and loud cry from an
academic-type reading, slams allow poets to act out their works (no
props allowed), something they do with glee _ and anger, sadness
and any other emotion you can name.
</P>
<P>
   We had just seen a bout almost exclusively devoted to
confrontational, screeching, in-your-face performances, and Smith
said that if she had to go next she would perform a quiet poem in a
quiet way. Changing the energy in a room is key, she explained, and
a couple of hours later, the theory proved true.
</P>
<P>
   At Blondies _ a skateboard shop by day, music venue by weekend
night _ Rolf Springer, an electronic-parts salesman from Phoenix,
was entered as an individual competitor. He followed three rounds
of intense, high-volume performances with a quiet, moving poem that
left the crowd hushed, and the judges rewarded him with a 28.5 _ at
the time, the highest score of the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time that's ever happened to me,'' Springer
said. Normally he doesn't score well because he all but eschews
performance, he explained. Alas, he wouldn't make the individual
semifinals (the Mesa team didn't advance, either), but on this
night the planets were aligned and Springer was smiling.
</P>
<P>
   And it sounded like poetry. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Observations made at the end of the preliminary bouts:
</P>
<P>
   - While almost everyone seemed friendly, there was clearly a
sense of camaraderie among the poets, a group of sometime-outsiders
enjoying time spent on the inside. The venues reminded me of a
baseball clubhouse _ the players let you in, they talk to you, but
you're not one of them and you both know it.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, there's even a hierarchy among poets. At first,
at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like rock tumbling,'' Steve Marsh, an English teacher
from Ann Arbor, Mich., and a longtime slammer, said. ``The edges
get knocked off by Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   - On average, a weak poem propped up by an over-the-top
performance almost always scores higher than a good poem performed
without much gusto. No one really wanted to admit as much, but no
one denied it, either.
</P>
<P>
   - Rare is the slam poem that doesn't deal in some way with race,
sex or some form or oppression. Often you get the idea the poet is
daring the judge not to give a good score. More often than not, the
judge complies.
</P>
<P>
   - There was plenty of pretension and attitude and forced
coolness for its own sake. But that was bearable, because these are
true believers, people for whom a turn of a phrase is a healing
balm. Words are tactile, visceral things to them, especially when
those words are spat out in front of a group of like-minded
believers. Well-respected, published poets stood shoulder to
shoulder with wannabe Jim Carroll-types, and both seemed to gain
something from the experience. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Friday's semifinals included a bout that matched San Francisco
against a team from that city's Mission District at La Zona Rosa,
one of seven venues used for the slam. Tension ran as thick as the
cigarette smoke. ``(Expletive) the score, this is personal,''
Russell Gonzalez, a San Francisco poet, said before launching into
a rant against the Mission District team that blew past the
three-minute time limit and effectively killed San Francisco's
chances after one round. The competition had heated up. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night. The finals _ $2,000 for the team champ, $500 for
the individual winner. The 1,300-seat Paramount Theater downtown
was sold out, to the delight of everyone filling those seats.
Patricia Smith announced that people were outside in the rain
scalping tickets. The audience roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rowdy crowd,'' one bartender told another. Yeah, well,
that's the point. Earlier, Paul Devlin _ whose film ``Slam
Nation,'' a documentary of last year's finals in Portland, Ore.,
recently got a good write-up in the ``New York Times'' _ explained
the event's attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finals (last year) were like a rock concert,'' he said,
``people giving standing ovations for a single poet. The energy,
the way the audience responds, the talent that comes from nowhere .
. .''
</P>
<P>
   But is it poetry?
</P>
<P>
   ``That same question was asked of T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound _ Allen
Ginsburg, for sure. . . . Who cares? Why worry if it's poetry? It's
so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, New York, Dallas and Cleveland vied for the team
championship. After two rounds, New York held a slim lead over LA
and Dallas; Cleveland lagged behind.
</P>
<P>
   The two-round individual finals were held between rounds two and
three of the team competition. After his first poem, it was clear
that Reggie Gibson, of Bellwood, Ill., couldn't be beaten. A
tribute to Jimi Hendrix, his piece relied heavily on performance;
it included an air-guitar segment in which he mimicked a Hendrix
solo with his voice. The second round was nothing more than sorting
out everyone else's places in the pecking order.
</P>
<P>
   The team finals resumed, and all four cities brought out their
big guns. Sarah Holbrook, an accomplished, published poet from
Cleveland, performed the single best poem I heard the entire four
days. It was a beautiful piece involving her meeting eyes with a
young, purple-haired, black-lipsticked girl in a bathroom mirror,
and how the girl would never understand how this soccer mom was
once more revolutionary than a would-be punk would ever be. But it
was too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   LA faltered with a group piece. Then, perfection: Dallas' group
piece about a Black redneck gay superhero scored a perfect 30 in
the fourth round. That left it up to Alix Olson from New York _ she
needed a 29.3 for her team to win.
</P>
<P>
   She bounded onstage and leapt into a piece that decried an
America for sale. She nailed buzzwords like ``downsize,'' and the
audience responded with cheers. She ended with, ``You're all
fired!'' The judges held up their cards and . . . a 29.7. New York
was the 1998 team champion.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a television reporter sounded like he was
interviewing John Elway when he stuck a microphone in Olson's face
and asked what she was thinking when she went onstage, knowing the
championship rested in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say it on camera,'' she replied. Sure didn't sound
like Elway. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Later, the poets gathered at a gallery for a blowout party. I had
enjoyed the slam, but still hadn't worked out an answer to my
question.
</P>
<P>
   I said goodbye to Allan Wolf, from Asheville, N.C. He has about
1,500 poems memorized, and makes his living performing them in
schools. An expert slammer, he emceed several bouts. Earlier in the
week I had asked him whether this was indeed poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's definitely poetry, and sometimes it's
definitely questionable,'' he said. ``It really forces you to
redefine what you think poetry is.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but it didn't answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there isn't a good answer,'' Wolf said. ``Maybe it's the
wrong question to ask.'' &QL;

CONGRESS HEARS CALLS FOR CRACKDOWN ON ABUSES IN SWEEPSTAKES
INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers and law-enforcement officials proposed a
series of tough measures Tuesday to reduce what they described as
deception and fraud in the nation's multibillion-dollar sweepstakes
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The steps ranged from prohibiting envelopes designed to look
like official government documents and strengthening civil and
criminal penalties to requiring large-print disclosures on the face
of every sweepstakes envelope specifying that it is a contest and
the recipient has not won automatically.
</P>
<P>
   There are no estimates of how many people are victims of
fraudulent sweepstakes operations or misled into making unnecessary
purchases by legitimate contests. But witnesses before a
subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Government Affairs
described numerous instances in which people had been duped into
believing they had won prizes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Butterworth, the attorney general of Florida,
recounted the story of a single mother from Baltimore who borrowed
$1,500 to fly to Tampa, Fla., to collect what she thought was a $10
million prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the national spotlight has fallen on people such as this
unfortunate young woman, they merely embody the most extreme
symptom of an underlying problem that affects millions,''
Butterworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints were also made about sweepstakes language that
declares recipients to be ``guaranteed winners'' and entry forms
saying that the grand prize is down to two people, the recipient of
the letter and one other person.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Barton, senior vice president of the Direct Marketing
Association, which represents 3,700 direct-marketing companies,
said that sweepstakes accounted for roughly a billion pieces of
mail each year and that studies showed that 11 percent of Americans
bought products in response to sweepstakes promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of people understand that sweepstakes mailings are
devices designed to get them to buy products, he said. Those who
are confused into traveling to Tampa to collect prizes or spending
inordinate amounts of magazine subscriptions are making what he
called ``inappropriate responses'' to sweepstakes forms.
</P>
<P>
   Barton said, however, that the industry planned to strengthen
its guidelines to clarify explanations of sweepstakes rules and to
develop programs to identify people spending substantial amounts on
contests and explain to them that no purchase is necessary to enter
a sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, requiring language on the front of sweepstakes
envelopes spelling out that the recipient has not won could reduce
sales so drastically that many companies could be forced out of
business.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was called to consider legislation introduced this
summer by Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo. Among other
changes, the bill would require disclaimers on the envelope front
and the first page of any accompanying material. Proposals for
additional changes were put forth by witnesses and other senators
at the hearing.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an effort to persuade senators that no further legislation
was necessary, Barton said the industry had adopted its own ethical
guidelines. But when Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., asked whether those
guidelines should be adopted as law, Barton elicited laughter in
the crowded hearing room when he responded, ``I'd have to admit
that they're awfully vague to be made into law.''
</P>
<P>
   The elderly are the primary victims of sweepstakes mailings and
fraudulent contests in part because they tend to believe the
official-sounding language emblazoned across sweepstakes entry
envelopes by the marketers, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   William E. Arnold, director of the gerontology program at
Arizona State University, said his recent research found that older
people were far more likely to open an envelope if it appeared to
be official, bearing language like ``Notice: Postmaster, the
security of this package is guaranteed from tampering.''
</P>
<P>
   These official-sounding enticements are so powerful, Arnold
said, that even when they were shown alongside a warning that the
envelope contained a game of chance, 78 percent of the respondents
said they were likely or very likely to open the envelope.
</P>
<P>
   What is required, he said, is not just changes to the language,
but a broad effort to educate consumers about the legitimate and
fraudulent sweepstakes business.

<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ With investment holdings flying out of this
country, international market analysts widely agree that
Venezuela's economy has been crippled by an overvalued currency,
government interference in monetary policy and irresponsible
spending that relies too heavily on oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Many Venezuelans, however, beg to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   Their political mood seems to be swinging in precisely the
opposite direction, with an overwhelming majority apparently
convinced that their oil wealth should guarantee decent salaries,
government services, job protection and retirement benefits.
Instead, with 80 percent of the population said to be living in
poverty, the country faces broad suspicions of free-market changes
widely described here as ``capitalsmo salvaje,'' or ``savage
capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidate for the presidency by a wide margin is
Hugo Chavez Frias, 44, a populist retired army colonel who led a
coup attempt against President Carlos Andres Perez in 1992. Andres
Perez was the architect of a short-lived stab at free-market
reforms in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez is leading in the polls with 46 percent, with his nearest
rival, Henrique Salas Romer, trailing at 27 percent, according to a
polling service, Datanalisis.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has raised the specter of protectionist barriers to
foreign trade, hinted at the possibilities of a one- or two-year
moratorium on debt payments and pledged to review concessions that
the state has granted foreign oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures have been widely viewed as hostile to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's populist message, faulting government corruption for
siphoning 15 percent of public revenues, resonates with Venezuelans
who are hard pressed to reconcile their petroleum wealth with their
fiscal difficulties. Chavez has called for a halt to privatization
of state assets at least until the country has some assurance that
the revenues from the sales of assets are going to the national
budget rather than to the personal accounts of that corrupt
officials have in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a nationalist,'' said Omar Lambaia, 53, a retired
military photographer who drives a taxicab. Lambaia retired 11
years ago and collects a pension equal to the full salary of an
officer on active duty, but he said the government was
shortchanging him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Lambaia said, ``I'm democratic. But when you see
that democracy is not doing anything for your country, that it's
destroying the country, you become a nationalist.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey by a poll analyst, Alfredo Keller, found that more than
85 percent of Venezuelans felt cheated out of the benefits of the
country's oil wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mining-boom-town mentality that weakens the notion that
one's well-being is tied to personal effort,'' said Robert Bottome,
publisher of a newsletter, Veneconomy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its failure to reduce the Civil Service system and
revise its pension system, the government has essentially used the
revenues it gained during earlier years of high oil prices to pay
the salaries of workers who are not really needed. More than 30
percent of the government budget goes to pay off debt, said Hugo
Faria, a consultant at the Institute of Advanced Studies in
Business.
</P>
<P>
   The price of oil, responsible for nearly half the country's
revenues, has dropped a third in recent months, taking the bottom
out of the economy. The stock market has dropped more than 70
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the Venezuelan bolivar is overvalued by up to 40
percent. Although the government has repeatedly denied plans to
devalue the bolivar, expectations of a devaluation persist. That is
forcing the government to spend down international reserves to $13
billion to protect the bolivar and to pump up interest rates for
short-term bonds to borrow additional money.
</P>
<P>
   At least $4.1 billion in short-term bonds are due in coming
months, further draining dollar reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is jumping ahead so fast that nobody is willing to
hold bolivars, because they don't know when the devaluation will
come,'' said Bottome.
</P>
<P>
   Lending rates to consumers are hovering at 100 percent a year,
and even at those rates the terms are punishing. Banks demand that
company presidents put up their houses and cars as collateral for
business loans.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Standard &AMP; Poor's revised its rating of Venezuela's
financial prospects downward, to negative from stable. The
financial service cited resistance from the president to the man in
the street to ``essential market-oriented reforms needed to
stabilize the economy.''

INTERNET BROKERS HANDLED MONDAY'S PLUNGE WITH FEW REPORTED
PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Market Plunge 2.0, it seems, is quite an upgrade for Internet
stock brokers.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last October when the first billion-share trading
day on the New York Stock Exchange tested Wall Street, many of the
new Internet trading services failed. Customers found their
brokers' Web sites had ground to a halt and the telephone lines
were clogged.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two days, with volume surging to a new record of
1.21 billion shares on the Big Board Tuesday, the Internet brokers
have handled the business with very few reported problems.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, the brokers say, is that they have made big
investments to increase their capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last October was a wake-up call for this industry,'' said
Joseph Konen, the president of Ameritrade Holdings, a brokerage
firm that mainly operates on the Internet. ``We have invested $15
million over the last year and have increased our capacity by 10
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that the investment has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole industry is doing dramatically better,'' said
Alexander Stein a principal of Gomez Advisors, a research firm that
studies online trading. ``Last October virtually every broker was
unable to serve some of their investors. This time, we haven't
heard of any failures.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisers conducted a test to see how long it took to for
an Internet user to load the main page of the various online
brokerage firms. On Monday, the average time was 5 seconds, a vast
improvement over last year.
</P>
<P>
   While investors may have had few problems, Internet brokers have
been busy, making margin calls _ in other words, the industry
practice of demanding customers who had borrowed money, secured by
their investments, pay off their loans or put up new collateral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday and today will be a record for the number of new
margin calls,'' said Thomas O'Connell, executive vice president of
Discover Brokerage Direct, the Internet trading service of Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``There are customers that are losing money,
and that's never good for business. But it's all going relatively
smoothly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of Discover's accounts have some margin
borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   He said that most people have been relatively cautious in the
use of leverage, that is using borrowed money to increase their
potential return and their risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get down there with the common people and look at
what they do with their own money, you'll see them being much more
conservative than you might expect.''
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the brokers are not in such trouble is that the
volume spikes have not been as out of the ordinary as they were
last year. Ameritrade Holding handled 35,000 trades on Monday,
about 1.7 times its average volume. Last October, its systems
bogged down when trading peaked at 2.5 times its daily volume,
Konan said.
</P>
<P>
   Konen said that customers did have to wait ``a few minutes'' to
talk to an Ameritrade broker on the telephone, but the wait was far
less than the 15 minutes on hold customers endured last October.
</P>
<P>
   Christos Cotsakos, chief executive of the E-Trade Group. said
that customers might have found trading a bit sluggish over the
last two days because market makers have been busier than usual,
but that E-Trade's own systems have not had any delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because access to information was a lot faster, there wasn't
the panic selling we saw last year,'' he said.

   The winter 1998 edition of the American Oxonian, a publication
for Rhodes scholars, includes a passage quoted in the latest New
Yorker:
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  writes that the biggest family news is he and
Hillary have become empty nesters. Also Hillary turned 50. He says
he likes being married to an older woman, but wishes their daughter
wasn't so far away. He still loves his job, but says that how
Washington views the world, spends its time and treats people is
often another matter. Bill writes that seeing friends eases the
pain of the empty nest ...''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Mike Wallace &LR;  called the Washington Post to say that
at a Martha's Vineyard clambake on Friday night,  &UR; Art &LR; 
 &UR; Buchwald  &LR; and  &UR; Hillary Rodham Clinton &LR;  and he were chatting, and
Buchwald said he was going to have a stress test this week.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace asked the first lady whether she'd ever had one. ``I'm
having one now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And HarperCollins editor  &UR; Judith Regan &LR;  ``denies'' a New Yorker
report that she offered a book deal to  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  for $2
million, which seemed like chopped liver after another publisher
offered $6 million. ``Not exactly,'' said Regan, which wasn't
exactly a denial.

   &UR; Bill Blass &LR; , guest editor of Civilization magazine, has ranked
the 50 most stylish figures of this century, which he insists is
``not a frivolous exercise.''
</P>

   Blass' best-dressed American is a cowboy, personified by

   &UR; ARTS AND CULTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ The director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has
asked museum members for suggestions for a new name. ``V&AMP;A,'' the
name commonly used for the eclectic collection of objets d'art,
``does not tell you about what we actually do,'' wrote
 &UR; Alan Borg &LR;  in the museum magazine, ``and quite a lot of first-time
visitors come expecting a museum devoted to the life of the Queen
and the Prince Consort, or perhaps devoted solely to the Victorian
age.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The average American shopping time for clothing is 45 minutes
a week, reports the men's-wear newspaper DNR; the average NikeTown
customer spends 45 minutes to an hour in the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view our competition not as other stores but as films and
sporting events,'' Nike's  &UR; John Hoke &LR;  told DNR, ``other
opportunities that grab people and make them feel alive and
inspired and challenge their thinking.''

<P>
   &UR; THE LAST PICTURE SHOW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Betsy Nolan &LR;  is fascinated by the ``Viewology cremation urn,''
as described in the latest issue of Brill's Content. This
contraption is a container for ashes, with one flat side that is a
video monitor ``on which the viewer can see photographs or read
stories about and trace the genealogy of the deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing it doesn't have is a soundtrack. &UR; Deac &LR; 
 &UR; Manross &LR; , whose Leif Technologies manufactures it, explains that
``the nature of a cemetery or funeral home is that it's quiet and
peaceful. And really, the last thing you want to hear is Grandpa on
a tirade against the Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are confused, which is good for them. A lot of them ask,
`Do we still have to pay?' Yes, you do. But that's the only thing
that's still the same, OK? That, and kill the bugs in the kitchen.
Everything else we can handle.''

   &UR; ALUMNI NOTES FROM NEAR AND FAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The winter 1998 edition of the American Oxonian, a publication
for Rhodes scholars, includes a passage quoted in the latest New
Yorker:
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR; Bill Clinton &LR;  writes that the biggest family news is he and
Hillary have become empty nesters. Also Hillary turned 50. He says
he likes being married to an older woman, but wishes their daughter
wasn't so far away. He still loves his job, but says that how
Washington views the world, spends its time and treats people is
often another matter. Bill writes that seeing friends eases the
pain of the empty nest ...''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile,  &UR; Mike Wallace &LR;  called the Washington Post to say that
at a Martha's Vineyard clambake on Friday night,  &UR; Art &LR; 
 &UR; Buchwald  &LR; and  &UR; Hillary Rodham Clinton &LR;  and he were chatting, and
Buchwald said he was going to have a stress test this week.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace asked the first lady whether she'd ever had one. ``I'm
having one now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And HarperCollins editor  &UR; Judith Regan &LR;  ``denies'' a New Yorker
report that she offered a book deal to  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  for $2
million, which seemed like chopped liver after another publisher
offered $6 million. ``Not exactly,'' said Regan, which wasn't
exactly a denial.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THAT CERTAIN SENSE OF STYLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Bill Blass &LR; , guest editor of Civilization magazine, has ranked
the 50 most stylish figures of this century, which he insists is
``not a frivolous exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   Blass' best-dressed American is a cowboy, personified by
kind-of-a-cowboy  &UR; Gary Cooper &LR; ; next rank down are  &UR; Audrey &LR; 
 &UR; Hepburn &LR; ,  &UR; Cole  &LR; and  &UR; Linda Porter &LR; ,  &UR; C.Z. Guest &LR; , the  &UR; Duke &LR;  and
 &UR; Duchess of Windsor &LR; ,  &UR; Mary McFadden &LR; ,  &UR; Slim Keith &LR;  and  &UR; Brooke &LR; 
 &UR; Astor &LR; . Among the names on the third level down are  &UR; Gianni &LR; 
 &UR; Agnelli &LR; ,  &UR; Josephine Baker &LR; ,  &UR; Nina Griscom &LR; ,  &UR; Tina Chow &LR; ,  &UR; Noel &LR;

<P>
   &UR; ARTS AND CULTURE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ The director of the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has
asked museum members for suggestions for a new name. ``V&AMP;A,'' the
name commonly used for the eclectic collection of objets d'art,
``does not tell you about what we actually do,'' wrote
 &UR; Alan Borg &LR;  in the museum magazine, ``and quite a lot of first-time
visitors come expecting a museum devoted to the life of the Queen
and the Prince Consort, or perhaps devoted solely to the Victorian
age.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The average American shopping time for clothing is 45 minutes
a week, reports the men's-wear newspaper DNR; the average NikeTown
customer spends 45 minutes to an hour in the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view our competition not as other stores but as films and
sporting events,'' Nike's  &UR; John Hoke &LR;  told DNR, ``other
opportunities that grab people and make them feel alive and
inspired and challenge their thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LAST PICTURE SHOW &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Betsy Nolan &LR;  is fascinated by the ``Viewology cremation urn,''
as described in the latest issue of Brill's Content. This
contraption is a container for ashes, with one flat side that is a
video monitor ``on which the viewer can see photographs or read
stories about and trace the genealogy of the deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing it doesn't have is a soundtrack. &UR; Deac &LR; 
 &UR; Manross &LR; , whose Leif Technologies manufactures it, explains that
``the nature of a cemetery or funeral home is that it's quiet and
peaceful. And really, the last thing you want to hear is Grandpa on
a tirade against the Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are confused, which is good for them. A lot of them ask,
`Do we still have to pay?' Yes, you do. But that's the only thing
that's still the same, OK? That, and kill the bugs in the kitchen.
Everything else we can handle.''

FROM EARTH TO THE MOON AND BACK, FOR MORE BOWS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave Scott, one of 12 people who have walked on the moon, talks
about movies and mini-series as if he were at the joy stick of a
lunar lander maneuvering for a good place to set it down.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Apollo 13' was vertically integrated,'' he said. `` `From
the Earth to the Moon' was horizontal.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott sees a movie as focusing on a facet or two and then
delving deeply. With more time to spend, a mini-series spills
outward into the nooks and crannies, spreading itself more thinly
but covering more ground.
</P>
<P>
   An astronaut for nine years in the '60s and '70s, Scott was
chief technological consultant on both projects: ``Apollo 13,'' the
1995 film about the ill-fated 1970 moon mission, and ``From the
Earth to the Moon,'' HBO's recent 12-hour mini-series that traces
the space program from John F. Kennedy's 1961 commitment to putting
a man on the moon by the end of the decade through the last manned
Apollo lunar mission in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, on its Signature channel, HBO will rebroadcast
``From the Earth to the Moon,'' which was nominated for 17 Emmy
Awards (to be presented next Sunday). Columbia House Video Library
has released the series to its members.
</P>
<P>
   In November, HBO will issue the series on four digital video
disks, and next July, for the 30th anniversary of the first manned
moon mission, the series will be in video stores.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material sprang from ideas born during the planning
of ``Apollo 13,'' which was made by many of the same people who
worked on the television production. Most notably there was Tom
Hanks, who starred in the film. The principal creator of the
series, he was its executive producer and helped write some of it.
</P>
<P>
   In the final episode he portrayed an assistant to Georges
Melies, the director of ``Le Voyage Dans la Lune,'' a 1902 fantasy
about going to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hanks had a lot of ideas about gaining an understanding of
real-life astronauts,'' said Brian Grazer, who produced ``Apollo
13'' and was a producer of the mini-series. Before the film, a
space school was set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had astronauts come and teach the guys,'' Grazer said. At
that point, they began to realize how much was involved with just
that one flight. ``We started breaking it down into minutiae and
realized we'd have a 500-page script,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They also began to appreciate the interconnection with
everything else that went on during the decade-long trip to the
moon. There was the exotic equipment, which in the days before
computer models often took form as handmade mock-ups.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a human story, as dramatized in ``Apollo 13'' by the
families waiting to see if they would get their husbands and
fathers back.
</P>
<P>
   But it remained to be seen if people were interested. ``Apollo
13'' answered that at the box office. ``If the film had done $60
million or $70 million, we would have said, `O.K., we dodged the
bullet,' '' Grazer said, ``but when it did $175 million, it was
clear that people were into the space program and the docudrama
format.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie cost about $61 million to make; the mini-series about
$68 million. Spread over 12 hours, the money didn't buy the
striking special effects of ``Apollo 13'' (although the effects are
elaborate by mini-series standards), but it did allow a good amount
of detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about weight,'' said a young engineer eating his
lunch in Texas in ``Spider,'' the episode that decribes the
development of a stripped-down lunar lander that with its jet
nozzles spouting at crazy angles, looked and acted like a teapot at
a boil.
</P>
<P>
   Hammered out through years of experimentation, the approved
design was named the lunar excursion module, or LEM. From then on
it was a battle to lose anything the least bit extraneous in its
design. Windows were heavy (about 600 pounds apiece).
</P>
<P>
   Did the LEM even need windows? Perhaps, someone pointed out, the
astronauts would appreciate seeing what they were landing on. All
right, it was agreed, give them a window. As planned, though, they
couldn't see out the window from their seats. But who needs seats?
In the moon's low gravity, the astronauts could land standing up.
And if they were standing up, the window could be smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually even the word ``excursion'' was dropped from LEM. The
project's director explains, ``Excursion sounds like it's going to
go out on a school trip.''

AFTER A MAJOR FRIGHT, THE VERY WEALTHY VOW TO HOLD ON FOR LONG
RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ Sheltered by a canopy at the residents-only
beach in this wealthy town of stone walls and private lanes, a club
of 37 investors gathered glumly around picnic tables for an
emergency meeting Monday night to deal with the day's stock market
rout. The early line: Dump the equities. Stop the losses.
</P>
<P>
   But then the members broke out the Merlot, French bread, salami
and olives, and started talking logically. Suddenly, the world,
even Wall Street, looked rosier. The club decided that ``long-term
investing'' should mean at least past Wednesday, and agreed to hold
on for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to be able to go to a cocktail party and say,
`I beat the whole thing,''' a club member, Daniel Sternthal, 48, an
architect, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At gyms, on commuter trains and at deli counters, America's
wealthiest investors paused this week to make hushed pacts against
panicking as Tuesday's stock market did a yo-yo and recovered
nearly 300 points of Monday's 512-point plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of the well-heeled residents here hope desperately
that Monday will not prove to be the sort of memorable turning
point that Oct. 19, 1987, was, they said the day's shock should
remind even the most brazen that the '90s will not roar forever.
And many people realized they had been counting on wealth that, for
a day at least, proved to be illusory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is still gambling,'' John R. Pagano, an accountant,
said as he took a lunchtime stroll on a pier at the Indian Harbor
Yacht Club. ``You can lose money. It's not a gain till you get the
money in your hand.'' Those words from Pagano, 34, will come as no
bulletin to experienced investors. But market players his age and
younger _ the kids of the bull _ have enjoyed such lucrative times
that many had begun to act as if the laws of financial gravity had
been repealed.
</P>
<P>
   In sheer dollars, few towns have benefited as much from the
soaring Dow than Greenwich, an old-money preserve that is the first
Connecticut suburb outside New York City. The hardware store is
carpeted, and the local magazine carries advertisements for estate
gates. As the market kept rocking, unimaginable wealth poured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had a reasonable endowment or inheritance when the
Dow was at 2,000, pretty soon $1 million was $4 million, and $2
million was $8 million,'' said John C. Sagan, 36, the risk manager
for a brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   Now, new Tudor mansions _ ``trophy houses,'' the miffed locals
call them _ crowd heirloom Cape Cods. The longtime Woolworth's on
Greenwich Avenue has become a Saks Fifth Avenue, with a window
display called ``The Eccentric English.''
</P>
<P>
   So convincing has been the bull's bounty that residents could
afford to sound a bit smug about a selling wave that investors
elsewhere found terrifying. ``People here are so rich, they're
still rich,'' Betsy Threshie, a 39-year-old sales manager, said
before Tuesday's muscular recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The week's turbulence prompted a bit of trust-fund humor at the
expense of the town's landed class. ``Panicked investors jump out
their windows _ into their pools,'' said Marcy Cronk, 24, a
recruiter for a technical services firm who grew up in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   A few people admitted that Monday's sell-off spooked them. ``I
knew the other shoe had to drop,'' said Cynthia R. Cash, 35, a
women's-clothing buyer who hopes to use her stock gains for a down
payment on a house. ``But I thought it would go down an inch at
time, so I'd know when to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   More typical was Nicholas J. Elezaj, 34, a hair-salon owner who
has lived in Greenwich for five years and spent $50,000 on an
Arctic silver Porsche Boxster in February. Tuesday, he stopped at
Pray Porsche to replace the wind deflector, and paused to check out
a black Porsche 911 that he plans to buy soon ``just for variety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The crash was pathetically over-hyped,'' Elezaj said. ``So
much money has been made, this is just like giving a little back.''
</P>
<P>
   A few people said they even saw advantages to the uncertainty.
Timothy E. Sanders, a 33-year-old lawyer for a Japanese trading
firm, is shopping for a house in the $400,000 to $450,000 range. If
the jitters continue, Sanders said, he figures he may be able to
pick up more land or a few extra bedrooms for the same price.
</P>
<P>
   And Thomas B. Stoecker, a bond salesman here, said Monday's
shock should give people a realistic view of the markets. ``People
were buying Mercedes-Benzes when they could afford Fords,'' said
Stoecker, 40.
</P>
<P>
   Many here say they learned their lesson from the implosion of
1987 and were more cautious this time around. Michael L. Metter,
47, the president of a boutique brokerage firm, said he had to sell
his 37-foot boat and house in the Hamptons after the crash, and was
more cautious this time around. ``I buy my Bentleys used,'' he
said. ``If things get really bad, I'll sell a car.''
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that some of the wealth is illusory and that some
young investors have bought huge houses ``on air'' _ with hopes
instead of cash. Several people brought up tales of the
bankruptcies of the early 1990s, when some people simply cleared
out their houses and mailed the keys to their lenders. ``Some
people have started to spend based on their gains and last year's
bonuses,'' said Richard S. Pluta, 39, who manages ``high
net-worth'' clients for a Wall Street brokerage firm. ``Those may
not last.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the Ferrari dealership in Greenwich such concerns were
nonexistent. Werner L. Pfister, the sales manager, was busy
Tuesday. He fielded a call from a client seeking what Pfister
called ``instant gratification in the Porsche area.'' Then Pfister
showed off a yellow 1999 model with a sticker price of $156,920
(racing seats, mesh grill and carbon-fiber interior included).
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a couple of weeks, I'll sell that car,'' Pfister said.
``My clients are mostly so well-to-do that they're insulated from
the shocks. But if the market moves the wrong way, they may need a
new toy as an extra distraction.''

JACKSON GATHERING DATA FOR MEETING WITH BOEING'S CONDIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BILL VIRGIN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson said getting data on hiring, promotion
and purchasing practices at The Boeing Co. is the first step in a
campaign to make sure the aerospace company is ``inclusive'' of
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader is scheduled to meet Friday with Boeing
Chairman Phil Condit. Earlier he had sent a letter to Condit asking
for the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he's willing to share the information and not be
defensive about it,'' Jackson said in a telephone news conference
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said his organization, the Chicago-based Rainbow/Push
Coalition, is paying more attention to corporate America generally,
but is particularly interested in Boeing because of suits filed
against the company charging racial discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   A Boeing spokeswoman said details of the meeting are being
worked out but declined to say what Condit specifically plans to
say at the meeting with Jackson. A plant tour for Jackson may also
be arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that after he receives data about Boeing, the
``second stage is mass education,'' to let the public know what its
findings are. After that his group would hope to enter negotiations
with Boeing to correct problems it believes exist.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, he said, Rainbow/Push Coalition would move to
``some form of leverage'' or confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson has been involved in campaigns against companies
that market consumer products, putting pressure on Boeing might be
more difficult. But Jackson said his group could use government
pressure, through Boeing's extensive contracts, to reach a
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also said Rainbow/Push Coalition may set up an office in
the Northwest.

U.S. FAULTS DEPOSITIONS OF MICROSOFT'S EXECUTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a court document made public Tuesday, the
Justice Department accused top executives of the Microsoft Corp.,
including its chairman, William Gates, of ``an astonishing lack of
recall'' when they were questioned under oath for the government's
antitrust suit against the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   That assertion, plus several pieces of new evidence to support
the government's case, were submitted to federal District Court
here as part of the Justice Department's response to Microsoft's
request that the case be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Executives who are stated to be the author of documents claim
not to remember writing them,'' government lawyers wrote.
``Executives who are the stated recipients of documents claim not
to remember receiving them. And both authors and recipients claim
not to know what the documents mean.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's new evidence was gathered by the Justice
Department in recent weeks in preparation for the trial, which is
set to begin on Sept. 23. It includes allegations that Microsoft
tried to bully several competing companies that until now had not
been mentioned in court proceedings. Among them are Intel Corp.,
Apple Computer, Real Networks, which makes video and audio software
for the Internet, and Intuit Corp., maker of Quicken accounting
software.
</P>
<P>
   In the depositions of Microsoft executives, which are still
under way, the government said that Gates ``displayed a particular
failure of recollection,'' even though ``he is placed at the center
of key events by numerous documents.''
</P>
<P>
   The brief provides the first look at the government's view of
the depositions of senior Microsoft leaders in recent days. The
questioning was to have been taken in public, but an appeals court
accepted Microsoft's request that the depositions proceed in
private. Gates' three-day deposition is to end on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said of the government's
lawyers: ``It's unfortunate that they have lost faith in the
substance of their case and have resorted to this kind of name
calling.'' He noted that Gates receives hundreds of pieces of
e-mail every day and so cannot be expected to remember every one of
them, especially those dating back several years.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department brief also accuses Gates and other
Microsoft executives of ``attempting to rewrite history'' in their
pretrial testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust suit, filed in May, accuses Microsoft of trying to
persuade or force a competitor, Netscape Communications Corp., to
give up part of the market for browsers, the software used to
navigate the World Wide Web. It also accuses Microsoft of illegally
integrating its browser, Internet Explorer, with the Windows
operating system and then claiming that the browser and Windows
were never intended to be separate products.
</P>
<P>
   In its brief, the government says that effort has now gone so
far that Microsoft executives no longer even utter the word browser
``except when they slip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although browser is a term used throughout Microsoft's
documents and licenses, the industry literature, and even in the
dictionary Microsoft publishes for software professionals,'' the
brief says, ``in the interest of Microsoft's litigation arguments
it becomes a nonword. Witnesses claim they don't know what a
browser is. What used to be browsers are now simply `bits of
browsing technologies.'''
</P>
<P>
   The brief also says that Microsoft's alleged effort to reduce or
eliminate competition from Netscape ``is part of a pattern that
includes similar discussions'' with other companies, including
Apple and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case say that the Justice Department
intends to use this new evidence to show that the initial evidence
offered to support its claims against Microsoft is standard
practice for the company. Some of the new evidence has been the
subject of news articles in recent weeks, but this is the first
time the Justice Department has indicated that it intends to use
the allegations as evidence in the trial.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 89-page brief charges that Microsoft tried to persuade Apple
``to withdraw its `QuickTime' software from competition with
Microsoft's `NetShow' software.'' Both products are used to receive
audio and video information from the Internet. The brief said that
Apple refused the request and added that Microsoft also tried to
coerce Apple to stop offering Netscape to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft makes a version of Internet Explorer for Apple's
Macintosh line of computers. Since Apple computers use the Mac OS
operating system, not Windows, the government argues that
Microsoft's dispute with Apple demonstrates that the browser is
obviously a stand-alone product, not a fundamental part of the
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's determination to restrict the support and
distribution of Netscape's browser by Apple is particularly telling
since Apple represents the main alternative to desktop PCs running
Microsoft's Windows,'' Justice Department lawyers wrote. ``Whatever
the relevance of Microsoft's arguments about why it wanted Windows
users also to use Internet Explorer, those arguments cannot apply
to Internet Explorer use by Apple users.''
</P>
<P>
   The charges concerning Real Networks are not as well defined
because some information in the document was deleted before it was
made public, and the department declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Real Networks, whose chief executive, Robert Glaser, is a former
Microsoft executive, also makes software that enables personal
computers to receive radio-style audio and television-style video
over the Internet. The government brief asserted that Microsoft
tried to ``coerce Real Networks'' to get out of the multimedia
software business and to withhold its technology from Microsoft's
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Intuit, the brief said, ``Microsoft succeeded in
getting Intuit to agree not to support Netscape, but only after
tying Intuit's access to valuable placement on the Windows desktop
to Intuit's agreement to abandon Netscape.'' The ``desktop'' is the
Windows main screen.
</P>
<P>
   The government also asserted that Microsoft pressured Intel into
agreeing that it would no longer write software intended to enhance
the performance of Intel's microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   To all of this evidence, Murray said: ``In every case, the
government is misrepresenting Microsoft's business relationships
with other companies. We meet with hundreds of companies to make
them aware of our technology plans and to promote the tools in our
operating system and to insure that our products and their products
work well together. Microsoft has never tried to divide any market,
period.''

USING THE HORSE TO HOLD A MIRROR TO THE HUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Sept. 6)  
 (bl)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Equestrian art may be as old as ancient Greece, but
Bartabas, the founder and director of the Paris-based Zingaro
Equestrian Theater, still likes to think he is doing something new.
He may well be right. Carving a niche for himself somewhere between
the classical dressage of, say, Vienna's legendary Spanish Riding
School and the athletic antics of circus horses, the 41-year-old
Frenchman has created an equestrian show that underlines the
emotional power of horses.
</P>
<P>
   Horses with emotion? Well, horses may be famously sensitive and
nervous animals, but Bartabas is more interested in how humans
react to them. And he stimulates this reaction by placing the
horses in an arena alive with music, theater and dance and lighted
to dramatic effect. The horses may do assorted tricks, like
trotting backwards or sitting on their haunches or simply
schmoozing affectionately, but it is the setting that gives meaning
to their movements _ and it is the audience that provides the
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 14 years ago, Zingaro now has a veritable army of loyal
fans across Western Europe. Two years ago, the troupe took its last
show, ``Chimere,'' to New York and found Americans to be equally
enthusiastic: 43 performances were attended by more than 42,000
people. Critics were also generally positive, uniformly loving the
horses and calling the show evocative and fanciful, though some
found it overly long and somewhat like a beautifully designed and
delivered circus act.
</P>
<P>
   Now Zingaro is back. Its new spectacle, ``Eclipse,'' opens the
Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival on Wednesday, with
41 performances scheduled at the Bigtop in Battery Park City in
Manhattan through Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   So how is ``Eclipse'' different from ``Chimere''? With
``Chimere,'' the music, costumes and horsemanship of the Indian
state of Rajasthan provided a framework for the piece; ``Eclipse''
uses the costumes and traditional pansori story-telling music of
Korea as a backdrop to the theme of black and white, light and
darkness, suggested by the show's title. Visually and musically,
then, ``Eclipse'' is new, but the spirit, mystery and excitement of
Zingaro live on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each show contains the seeds of the next one,'' Bartabas
explained, showing a visitor around the stables beside his round
wooden theater on the outskirts of Paris at Aubervilliers. ``
`Chimere' included the premise of `Eclipse,' so it's a natural
evolution. I'd say that the true inspiration of the show is our
daily work here. The theme is just a pretext. The more I plunge
into the relationship of humans with horses, the more it seems to
resemble the relationship between human beings. That's the
universal side of our work. The horse for me is like a mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Zingaro's ``natural evolution'' does seem to be leading
it more toward choreography. Indeed, if its first three shows could
have been called Equestrian Cabaret 1, 2 and 3 and its fourth was
Equestrian Opera, ``Chimere'' and ``Eclipse'' could perhaps be
termed Equestrian Ballet, yet this could also give the wrong
impression. When Bartabas talks of the increased choreographic
component in his shows, he is not associating himself with, say,
the ``ballets of horses'' popular in 16th-century France and Italy.
Rather, he is referring to the choreography of the entire show.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in ``Eclipse,'' along with 26 horses of various shapes,
sizes and colors, there are 12 performers _ riders, acrobats and
dancers _ who interact with the horses, with each other and with
the six musicians. The four dancers, who have classical training,
are not expected to ride the horses, but they relate to the horses
through their own choreography. One of the dancers is an American,
Quincella Swyningam, who was previously in Pina Bausch's dance
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the analogy between dancers and horses,'' said Julio
Arozarena, 32, a Cuban who joined Zingaro from Maurice Bejart's
dance company. ``We're asked for force, elegance and precision in
movement, and horses have this naturally. But no matter how good a
dancer you are, you feel ridiculous in front of a horse. The horse
moves so much better than you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the dancers, of course, Zingaro's horses are also trained,
but not in the tradition of classical schools of dressage. For a
start, Bartabas picks his horses not for their breeding or
appearance but for what he feels to be their personality. Some are
only 12 months old when he buys them, others may be 5 or 6 years
old and already partly trained, but in each case something about
them catches his eye. Further, he does not acquire a horse with an
eye to ``casting'' a particular role in a show. Rather, he says, it
is the horse that determines what it can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``With classical dressage,'' he explained, ``horses are taught
more mechanically to do something very specific. They are under
what I call permanent control. That's exactly the opposite of what
I try to do. We're not there to show how well we ride the horses.
My aim is to bring out the personality of the horses as you might
with people, to let the horses express themselves. For example, a
big black horse called Zingaro sits at the end of `Eclipse.' He
decided to do that. If one day he has an accident, I won't try to
do that with another horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Zingaro is one of the six horses that the wiry Bartabas rides in
``Eclipse,'' and he has developed a close relationship with each of
them.
</P>
<P>
   Other riders in turn look after their own horses and are charged
with exploring the animals' personalities and abilities. Some
horses, for example, perform best without any riders; others are
strong and calm enough to allow acrobats to use them almost like
springboards. In training, only one rule applies to all the riders
and their horses: as Bartabas puts it, ``Movements should be
proposed, never imposed.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``A horse is fairly dumb,'' he explained with a laugh. ``People
are always a bit shocked when I say that. A dancer or musician can
suffer for hours on end because he knows why he is suffering. But a
horse cannot suffer. When you work a horse, you have to go in
stages until he finally gives you the movement. If the movement
involves pain, he will resist and remember. You have to listen to
each horse because what works for one does not work for another.
There is no single method.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Eclipse,'' some of the most exciting moments are in fact
the simplest, as when a figure dressed in a white gown and carrying
long butterfly wings spins in the middle of the sand-covered ring
as a white horse races around the outside in the opposite
direction. There are also moments when no horse is in the arena, as
in the stylized competition between a black man dancing and a white
man performing acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
   Zingaro will continue performing ``Eclipse'' until September
1999, but the stables at Aubervilliers already house six Portuguese
horses, each cream colored with distinctive blue eyes, that will
appear in the next show. The new show itself is still taking shape,
but it should mark a fresh choreographic leap forward. Bartabas
plans to do his own version of Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring'' in a
program that will also include the composer's choral work,
``Symphony of Psalms,'' and Pierre Boulez's orchestral piece
``Dialogue of the Double Shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Bartabas and Arozarena are debating whether to
base the choreography of the seven dancers in the show on the
Indian martial art known as Kalarippayat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boulez will record the soundtrack, but perhaps we'll do one
performance with full choir and orchestra when it opens at the
Avignon theater festival in July 2000,'' Bartabas said. ``I've
always wanted to do the `Rite of Spring.' I think we're ready for
it, and I think our public is ready for it. We're evolving, and our
public is evolving with us. I like having the same public. That's
why I'm not interested in touring the United States. I want to keep
returning to New York.''

RENO ORDERS PERJURY PROBE OF ICKES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday ordered an
investigation into whether former deputy White House chief of staff
Harold M. Ickes committed perjury last year when he testified
before a Senate committee examining Democratic campaign
fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she had begun a 90-day review that could lead to the
appointment of an independent prosecutor. She said her decision was
based on a report by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that
accused Ickes of misleading the panel about his dealings with the
Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that evidence and testimony uncovered by the
committee contradicted Ickes' statements that he was unaware of
some White House efforts to intervene on behalf of the Teamsters in
a labor dispute with a California company, Diamond Walnut Growers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Democrats were trying to enlist the union's
support for the re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The committee concluded in a widely publicized report issued in
March that Ickes himself had asked administration officials to help
settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes' lawyers issued a statement Tuesday saying that Ickes did
not break the law. ``Mr. Ickes has been called upon to testify some
20 times as a result of his three years years of White House
service,'' said Robert Bennett and Amy Sabrin. ``He has testified
truthfully on all occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in a statement released on his trip to
Russia that Ickes ``has been a trusted adviser and a dedicated
public servant,'' adding, ``I am confident that investigators will
find he acted lawfully and appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months in which she has repeatedly refused Republican
demands to refer campaign finance issues to an outside prosecutor,
Reno's decision indicated that the Justice Department could be
shifting its approach. Her decision marked the second time in less
than a week that she advanced an important step toward such an
appointment over a political fund-raising issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she ordered a three-month inquiry into whether Vice
President Al Gore lied to investigators about his telephone
fund-raising solicitations from the White House. Gore's aides have
said his fund-raising phone calls were proper and that he did
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision Tuesday came on the eve of a potentially pivotal
day in her own tenure. Wednesday, she is scheduled to confront
lawmakers who have denounced her refusals to refer the entire
tangle of fund-raising issues to independent prosecutor. The
lawmakers have demanded that she produce a report by Charles La
Bella, a former top aide who urged her to seek an independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella's report, who headed Justice Department's campaign
finance unit, also concluded that Reno should review Ickes'
activities. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
La Bella had uncovered additional evidence against Ickes. La Bella
is expected to accompany Ms. Reno to the meeting with members of
the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee, who has urged Reno to appoint an independent
prosecutor, suggested that her inquiry into Ickes was too narrow.
He said the preliminary investigation ``should be followed by a
broad-based request for an independent counsel to investigate the
entirety of the Democratic campaign finance scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials denied that the timing of Reno's
decision was an effort to ease the antagonism against her in
Congress. They said the decision on launching the review of Ickes
was nearly settled last week, but Reno delayed the decision until
Tuesday by asking for more legal analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The decision suggested that for the first time, Reno allowed
political factors to enter in to her thinking. Until now, Reno had
bluntly dismissed the increasingly exasperated Republican requests
for her to invoke the discretionary part of the law, which permits
her to seek an outside prosecutor if the subject of an allegation,
in this case Ickes, poses a personal, financial or political
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Reno acknowledged for the first time that the case
posed such a conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Ickes statements at issue were made during a deposition and
in a combative appearance before the Senate panel on Oct. 8, 1997.
A lawyer and one of the chief designers of the huge fund-raising
machine set up in behalf of President Clinton's re-election, Ickes
testified that ``we did what the law allowed,'' saying that he
abided by the letter of the law during the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes denied that he knew of a plan in which the Democrats were
to swap funds with the re-election campaign of Ron Carey, then
president of the union. Ickes also denied that he knew of any
efforts by the White House to help settle a strike at Diamond
Walnut Growers, a large California-based food cooperative. The
panel's report, though, said that internal teamsters' memorandums
obtained by the panel showed that Ickes had asked former U.S. Trade
Representative Mickey Kantor to intervene with a senior Diamond
Walnut executive to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, an aide to Ickes told the committee that Ickes had
asked her to follow up his conversation with Kantor to determine
whether the trade representative had actually made contact with the
chief executive officer of the company.

PUPPETEERS WITH A HAND IN THE APARTHEID PROTESTS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DONALD G. MCNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ For Basil Jones and Adrian Kohler,
forming the Handspring Puppet Company _ which on Wednesday leads
off the International Festival of Puppet Theater in New York _ was
partly artistic inspiration and partly draft-dodging. The
inspiration part worked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, they were struggling art school graduates living in
Botswana, just north of South Africa, and trying to keep from being
swept into the military, as virtually all white males were during
South Africa's disastrous secret war in Angola. But they wanted to
go home. As a gay couple in a conservative African country, they
were uncomfortably conspicuous. Besides, their art was suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who says he was ``a fully alienated sculptor doing
avant-garde, not-very-well-understood assemblages for very tiny
audiences,'' was making ends meet as a graphic artist at the
national museum in Botswana. Kohler, a puppeteer since childhood,
was also in government employ, doing puppet shows that explained
the benefits of road construction and visiting nurses to rural
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Kohler came home one day, Jones said, with a long-limbed Malian
puppet and stories about the satiric theater of Mali, and his
partner was hooked. ``I had thought puppets were beneath me, I'm
sorry to say,'' Jones said. ``It finally dawned on me that they
could be exciting and communicative.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft was trickier. Under South African law then, the sole
owner of a business got a deferment. The two men returned to South
Africa, registered Handspring as a company _ one whose assets were
limited to a truck, trunks of puppets and a few sleeping bags and
cooking pots _ and began traveling to small towns, performing in
school auditoriums and sleeping at campgrounds. They contrived to
switch the ownership back and forth so that whoever was to face the
draft board was the proprietor.
</P>
<P>
   They were both called up anyway. Both separately announced that
they were gay. The responses still baffle them. Jones was
immediately transferred into the Cape Colored Corps, a nonwhite
unit. ``I never got an explanation,'' he said, laughing, ``but I
was allowed to go home at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler's examining doctor, by contrast, snapped that he wasn't
going to Angola to have sex, but to fight. ``And besides _ I have
sexual problems myself,'' the doctor added. When Kohler refused to
carry a gun, he was made a medic and sent to the front.
</P>
<P>
   They survived, as did Handspring, the acclaimed company they now
run from their combined home, carpentry studio and rehearsal space
in Johannesburg. The two men are South Africa's premier puppeteers,
and half of the collaboration that has produced ``Ubu and the Truth
Commission,'' which begins performances on Wednesday at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the play's title comes from the daily hearings held last
year in South Africa by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission,
which, probing the ugliest depths of apartheid's worst crimes,
sought testimony from victims and perpetrators alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ubu'' will be performed through Sept. 13, as part of the
biennial festival, which runs through Sept. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Jones and Kohler work with both rod and hand puppets, standing
behind a table in view of the audience. ``Some festivals put a
little `b' next to your name, meaning you work in the Japanese
bunraku style, because you're visible,'' Kohler said.
</P>
<P>
   The other collaborators on ``Ubu'' include William Kentridge,
one of South Africa's best-known painters, print-makers and
film-makers, who directed the production and produced the animated
black-and-white film that serves as a backdrop for the puppets and
actors. Jane Taylor, a professor of English at the University of
the Western Cape, wrote most of the script.
</P>
<P>
   Kentridge had already collaborated with Handspring on one of the
hits of the 1994 festival in New York: ``Woyzeck on the Highveld,''
an adaptation of the 19th-century play by Georg Buchner. Kentridge
was also a partner on ``Faustus in Africa,'' performed at the
Kennedy Center in Washington, and on a staging of Monteverdi's
opera ``Il Ritorno d'Ulisse in Patria,'' which is touring Europe
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The director said that his politics and those of Jones and
Kohler ``are broadly the same _ a general humanist left-liberal
vision of the world, though Basil is probably more suspicious of
socialist impulses than Adrian or I would be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But our decisions don't start with a political discussion, but
rather with one of how things will work,'' Kentridge said. When
they first tentatively discussed working together, he noted,
``Adrian carved a puppet, I made a piece of animation _ and it was
clear within four minutes that we were onto something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ubu'' is a melange of puppetry, performance by live actors,
music, animation and documentary footage. It takes the licentious,
anarchic slob Ubu, created in 1888 by a French student, Alfred
Jarry, who was aping his science teacher, and turns him into a
South African police goon for whom torture, murder, sex and gorging
at the dinner table are all variations on a single gross appetite.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ubu is played by an actor, Dawid Minnaar, in underwear and
combat boots, and his wife by the actress Busi Zokufa in a kind of
Martian evening gown made of linen. (In a switch on Jarry's
comic-book conceptual drawings, Minnaar is scrawny while Ms. Zokufa
is as ample as the original Ubu.)
</P>
<P>
   Ubu's commander is a puppet crocodile, his team of killers a
three-headed dog and the people whose sons and husbands he has
killed, human-faced puppets speaking actual testimony delivered
before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``A puppet does ordinary things in powerful ways,'' Kentridge
said. ``A puppet laying a table is much more potent than a person
laying a table.''
</P>
<P>
   Brought before the commission, Ubu finally cringes: ``Don't
blame me. Blame those above me. Blame those below me. Blame those
beside me.'' Like most apartheid killers who apply for forgiveness
for acts of uncommon beastliness they can persuasively argue were
political, he ultimately gets away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kentridge and Professor Taylor usually lead discussions
of the show's politics, Jones, 47, and Kohler, 46, have long
backgrounds in protest theater. Handspring did children's works
until 1985, but even those had ``a strong undertone of morality''
and subtle allusions, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   One piece, about a circus with a tyrannical ringmaster, was
possible to read as a comment on the South African police state.
That, and the fact that they had two black puppeteers, ``sometimes
became a problem with right-wing schools,'' Jones added.
``Everything had to be discussed in the staff room and passed by
the headmaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1985, they adapted a radio play based on a banned book
by David Lytton, ``Episodes of an Easter Rising.'' In it, two white
women _ whom the play implies are lesbian lovers _ find a wounded
black activist sought by the police hiding on their remote farm and
are forced to decide what to do.
</P>
<P>
   With that work, Jones and Kohler invited themselves to the
seventh World Festival of Puppet Theater in Chareville-Mezieres,
France. At first, they were allowed only one performance, because
French activists said they were breaking the cultural boycott
against South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to explain in broken French that there were white South
Africans who didn't like apartheid,'' Jones said. ``In the end, the
French couldn't believe we could get away with performing this.
They thought we shouldn't go back.''
</P>
<P>
   But the police at home put more emphasis on banning books and
movies than on puppet theater, Kohler noted, adding, ``It wasn't a
particularly heroic thing to do, I'm afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler, who grew up in the coastal city of Port Elizabeth, says
he did not come to protest politics until he met Jones at the
University of Cape Town and later worked with the Space Theater, an
integrated company with many members sympathetic to black
liberation movements.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, he said, was always suspicious of the state, perhaps
because he idealized his father, who died when he was 12. Though a
clerk on the government railway, the elder Jones was an iconoclast
and an atheist _ unusual at a time when the Dutch Reform Church
held such sway.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who is very organized and politely reticent, handles all
administrative details of the company. Kohler, the kind of man who
interrupts telling his own life story to say he really must go fix
the roof now, is the puppet-maker.
</P>
<P>
   The surfaces of his figures are roughly gouged but appear
intricate, while the faces are hinged so that when a dog talks, for
example, not only does its jaw open but its tongue moves in synch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carving is deeply structured into Adrian's psyche,'' Jones
said. ``It's the first real skill he learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Kohler is the son of a carpenter who made boats and furniture
and of an art teacher who used marionettes in her classes. One
family project involved spending six years making a 40-puppet
version of ``Dr. Dolittle'' to entertain the neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In art school, Kohler abandoned marionettes for rod and hand
puppets. ``Stringed puppets are brilliant at walking but the minute
you start fighting or making love, you have problems,'' Jones
observed. ``And to pick up a glass or throw a parcel bomb is very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The two say this and the Monteverdi opera are probably their
last collaborations with Kentridge for now, and their last works so
rooted in European classics.
</P>
<P>
   ``William has a lot of visual art he wants to catch up on, and
after four very successful productions together, we feel it's time
to do something on our own,'' Jones said.

   Galarraga to hear today on appeal of suspension
</P>
<P>
   After presenting his case to National League president Len
Coleman on Tuesday, Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga will hear
today whether his appeal had any effect on his three-day
suspension. The Braves first baseman is facing his second
suspension in as many years after charging Los Angeles pitcher
Darren Dreifort Aug. 22. Although the Braves said they were pleased
with their presentation, chances are remote that the suspension
will be reduced.

 &HT;    HOUSTON'S TALL ORDER
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was late summer 1982, and a tall, scraggly teenager from
California with an above-average fastball was trying to make a
decision about his immediate future. The choices were college or
professional baseball, Southern Cal or the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the days of the early radar guns, and I remember us
all sitting there with our guns on the dugout watching this kid,''
recalled Paul Snyder, the Braves' director of scouting back then
and today. ``You watched him and he was a bunch of legs and arms,
but you knew he would grow into his body and fastball. So we took
him. But his parents couldn't agree on what to do. One wanted him
to go to college, the other play for us. It got so intense between
them as a family, we just backed off.''
</P>
<P>
   That player was the Big Unit, Randy Johnson, the Braves'
third-round pick. He didn't sign with Atlanta, turning down a
signing bonus of $55,000, a huge figure back then for a player not
taken in the first round. And so today, instead of helping the
Braves, he might be what prevents them from getting out of the
first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson faces Greg Maddux tonight at Turner Field in a dream
pitching matchup that very well could be a preview of the
divisional series opener. Since Houston acquired him from the
Seattle Mariners on Aug. 1, the 34-year-old Johnson might have
turned the Astros into the National League's premier team. They
already had the league's best offense, but Johnson gives them the
ace they haven't had at the top of their rotation since Mike Scott
a dozen years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After the trade, the Astros went 22-7 for August, matching the
Yankees' win total for the month and playing at an amazing .759
clip.
</P>
<P>
   Houston never has been so abuzz about baseball. When Johnson
pitches, they pack the Astrodome. Local television ratings have
almost doubled. A franchise that hasn't made it to a World Series
in its 37-year history now has hope, and veterans such as Craig
Biggio and Jeff Bagwell have never been so excited. They said the
night they got Johnson, they couldn't even sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives the regular players a feeling of confidence
and maybe even close to a feeling of destiny,'' manager Larry
Dierker said. ``I think up to the time we got him, we felt like we
could win our division or the very least win the wild card and get
in the playoffs. Most of the guys thought if we get lucky, we can
advance. Now, with Randy, I think we
</P>
<P>
   feel if we play good ball, we can advance.''
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson pitched in his first game for the Astros,
outfielder Moises Alou said, ``To be honest, I had goose bumps in
the outfield during the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell said, ``The first pitch of the first inning, I thought,
'Wow, the Big Unit playing for us, the Astros.'''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux might be considered the best pitcher in baseball, Johnson
has always been the most dominating, standing 6-feet-10 and
throwing left-handed and sidearmed.He signed with the Expos in
1985, took a few years in the minors to develop and finally came
into his own with Seattle. His no-hitter in 1990, his 130 wins and
2,100 strikeouts in Seattle, his heroic effort in the 1995 playoffs
all made headlines. His slider embarrasses batters trying to hit
against him when he has the pitch working.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the toughest I have ever faced,'' said Braves infielder
Ozzie Guillen, one of the few Atlanta players to have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also has found new life, after a bitter four months of
the season with Seattle. The Mariners started slowly and so did
Johnson. In his 23 starts with the Mariners, he was 9-10 with a
4.33 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The free-agent-to-be was the object of constant trade talks. To
the Yankees. To the Indians. To Los Angeles, where a done deal in
June was vetoed by one of the Mariners' owners. ``It was like the
Clinton-Lewinsky thing,'' Johnson said. ``You're sick of hearing
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in Houston, not even general manager Gerry Hunsicker,
thought the Astros could get Johnson. But with only minutes left
before the July 31 trading deadline, other clubs hadn't offered
what Seattle wanted. Hunsicker jumped in, and for three good
prospects Johnson was his. Since then, Johnson is 5-1 with a 1.17
ERA, striking out 61 in 46 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like night and day,'' Johnson said. ``Now, I'm focused. I
was trying to stay focused in Seattle, but there was a lot going
on. I feel bad for the fans there, my teammates, because it was
like something was just hovering over the team. But that past is
done and over with now. I am having a lot of fun right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has dispelled concerns about his impact on the Astros'
generally sedate clubhouse. The Big Unit marches to his own
drummer, but the transition has been smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, meanwhile, wants the public to know that he is not a
savior. ``There shouldn't be more attention on me the day that I
pitch,'' he said. ``This team was in first place when I got there.
I'm human. People expect me to win every time. There are a lot of
elements that people don't realize. I go out there and have an off
day, then a team is going to have a field day with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson is not going to be able to dampen the enthusiasm.
Houston desperately wants a champion, and it sees Johnson as the
vehicle to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is really pumped,'' Dierker said, ``and that
certainly can help you.''
</P>
<P>
   It happened for the Braves in 1991. Come October this year, this
Houston team might be the team to beat in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a much different feeling on this team (now) than
there was last year,'' Biggio said.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, the Braves have to deal with Johnson tonight.
Guillen has some advice for teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lot of people are intimidated when they faced him, so you
have to get up there and not worry about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, it doesn't matter. Braves shortstop Walt Weiss faced
Johnson in the minors and again with Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact that he is so tall makes him different from
everybody else,'' Weiss said. ``When we faced him in the minors, we
couldn't hit him when he threw the ball over the plate. The
difference now is he has control. So when he is good, it's very,
very tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said he is looking forward to
facing Johnson. ``What makes him so different is you don't see a
pitcher 6-10 and throwing sidearmed. My goal on my first at-bat is
just get the bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   For Maddux, however, tonight is just another start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am just going to go out there and pitch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddux did add, ``Randy is like one of those (hard-throwing)
guys like (Roger) Clemens,((John) Smoltz and (David) Cone. When
they are on, it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one is sure how long Johnson will stay in Houston, once
he becomes a free agent when the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got five weeks left here; I don't think that is a fair
question,'' he said. ``Am I going to sign here in Houston? I don't
know if they like me, and I don't know if I like Houston that much.
I am here right now.''

 &HT;    Rookies vie for right tackle start
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, Ephraim Salaam could see it was time to make a
change. The black Corvette he'd been driving for months wouldn't do
anymore. So the Atlanta Falcons rookie had his old pickup truck
shipped east from California. Now he fits in with other offensive
tackles _ sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we started practicing, my legs started to get more and more
tired,'' Salaam said. ``I called my financial guy and said, `You
need to ship the truck; the Corvette is getting too difficult to
get in and out of.'''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam might be in another tight spot on Sunday, when the
Falcons open the season at Carolina. He or rookie Jose Portilla
will be picked to start at right tackle and play against Kevin
Greene and Lamar Lathon.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, who is 6 feet 7, 298 pounds, was a seventh-round pick
from San Diego State whose draft stock had plummeted because of his
reputation for indifference. Portilla, 6-6, 320 from Arizona,
wasn't drafted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surprising how the lineup is shaking out,'' Portilla said
of the Falcons' decision to put veteran right tackle Corey Louchiey
on injured reserve. ``We have to step up tremendously. I accept
that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult to find two players with as many
differences.
</P>
<P>
   Portilla didn't play football until he was a sophomore in high
school in Houston, when a gym teacher encouraged him to try out.
He's a power blocker with balance.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam has been an excellent athlete most of his life, taking
after an older brother _ Deon _ who plays pro basketball in Europe.
Salaam played basketball at San Diego State, and what he lacks in
upper-body strength, he tries to make up with athleticism and
speed.
</P>
<P>
   Salaam, the youngest Falcon after turning 22 in June, was born
in Chicago to a Muslim family and was given a first name meaning
``emperor or king,'' and a last name meaning ``peace'' in Arabic.
He loves to talk, sometimes gesturing as he goes.
</P>
<P>
   Portilla, who will turn 26 on Sept. 11, was born in Mexico to
Spanish-Mexican parents. He speaks softly and spent nearly two
years _ 1993-94 _ on a mission for the Mormon Church, counseling
gang members in a Spanish-speaking area of inner-city Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Their greatest similarity is that they're both way ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Salaam seems more comfortable than he should be, but
he's mindful of what's ahead. His relative lack of strength is not
the biggest problem he's likely to have, especially against
Carolina's zone-blitzing 3-4 defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this level, if you're at the line thinking, `Do I have him,
or him, or him?' and the ball is snapped, you probably won't block
any of them,'' said Salaam, who grew up in Birmingham, Los Angeles
and Sacramento. ``There's a lot of studying. And you got to use
different techniques for different guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a big defensive lineman head up, I set up one way and
try to get my hands on him quick. If it's a linebacker, he's
quicker, but he's pretty strong, too. You don't want to set up too
far back. If you've got a (defensive back), who's even further
outside, he's not as strong, but he's got an angle. You can't step
out at him because if you lunge, he'll disappear right past you.''
</P>
<P>
   Portilla is more deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the pro level, everybody is a speedster,'' he said. ``And
holding is to our advantage. As long as you keep your hands inside
and don't extend your arms so much that (officials) see the
(defender's) jersey getting pulled, you've got a fighting chance
not to get a penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Both young men are learning fast.
</P>
<P>
   Portilla, who spent three years at Ricks Junior College in
Idaho, credits Salaam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been the longshot,'' he said. ``But I know the
harder you work, the better you're going to get. We support each
other, but we're competitive. We know we're competing, and I
respect him because he's making me better. I know he's getting
better, so I have to do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Salaam is trying to erase sloppy work habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, if you got your hands on (a defender), that's
about the end of the play,'' he said. ``It was getting to the point
where I wasn't lifting weights, thinking, `I can block these guys.'
Here, you have guys I've watched on TV, guys who've been to Pro
Bowls, guys who make their living killing quarterbacks. If I don't
focus and play as hard as possible every play, I'm not out there
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on Tuesday's off day, Salaam was trying to learn. After the
last free lunch served in the cafeteria at the Falcon Inn adjacent
to team headquarters, he asked, ``When do we start getting paid?''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday. At Carolina.

THE EXPENSIVE RACE TO OWN THE CLEVELAND BROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bart Wolstein has built country clubs, strip malls, Kmarts and
offices. They made him fabulously rich, but the thrills are past.
Now when Wolstein, the son of a Minsk cloth cutter, thinks of what
he must do, one thing remains: buying the Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no more excitement in the world than owning a team on
game day,'' Wolstein, who once owned the Cleveland Force of the
Major Indoor Soccer League, said during an interview in his
suburban Cleveland office. Feeling left out of Cleveland's business
elite, he seeks entree to a club more exclusive than the U.S.
Senate. ``An NFL guy is an entrepreneur,'' he said. ``I'm their
kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolstein is leading one of the four groups still competing in a
unique bazaar: the National Football League's auction of the
revived Browns for what is almost certain to be the highest price
ever for a sports team, one that could double the $311 million paid
this year for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag apparently grew too steep for three of the seven
original bidders: They dropped out Tuesday before second bids were
due at noon. Next Tuesday, NFL owners will meet in Chicago to award
the franchise to one of the remaining four groups.
</P>
<P>
   The new Browns will succeed the old ones, a beloved team that
helped define this city's sports psyche but was moved in 1996 by
the debt-ridden owner Art Modell to the comfort of a revenue-rich
new stadium in Baltimore. Modell, who gave up the Browns' name,
logo and colors as part of the agreement that allowed him to move,
will not get a share of the Browns franchise fee.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the financial competition for the Browns _
featuring millionaire, billionaire and celebrity partners,
including Bill Cosby and Don Shula, and bidding rationales like
civic duty and a pained conscience _ captures the bacchanalian
nature of modern sports business.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Browns occurs at a time when television networks
gladly overspend to secure the long-term rights to pro football;
players sign contracts that exceed what the owner paid for the
team; teams sell for ever-higher prices, and cities help pay for
sports palaces despite urgent municipal needs.
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, for example, the public school system is in
receivership, and Mayor Michael White will take control of it _ one
day after the Browns' auction. City taxes will pay 58 percent of
the cost of a new $280 million, 72,800-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The income streams for the stadium couldn't be used for
schools, so we're not robbing children to pay for football,'' White
said. ``Far more important is keeping a community mosaic; just as
the Browns are important, so are universities, art museums and
public education.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the race to acquire the Browns raises again the question
of how to measure what a team means to a city _ in this case, a
city left furious at Modell's perceived carpetbagging.
</P>
<P>
   And what does owning the Browns mean to the bidders who
acknowledge that instant profits are hardly likely?
</P>
<P>
   ``Each bidder has his own motivations and objectives for their
investment,'' said Roger Goodell, an NFL senior vice president.
``Some see it for return on their investment, some for asset
appreciation.''
</P>
<P>
   How slim the profits may be is well understood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think,'' the billionaire credit card executive Alfred
Lerner asked facetiously, ``that I can get all the way up to a
little return?''
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which this week's stock market correction may
influence bidding is unknown. Two of the remaining bidders, Charles
Dolan, chairman of Cablevision Systems, and Lerner, chairman of
MBNA Corp., run public companies, while a third, Wolstein, is
chairman emeritus of the publicly traded Developers Diversified
Realty, which his son runs.
</P>
<P>
   For months, there were seven confident candidates; second bids
were due at noon Tuesday and were to form the basis of talks
between the groups and Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the NFL's financial
adviser, which will seek to negotiate still higher bids. The first
round of bids last month created an informal floor estimated at
$350 million. The highest bidder will not necessarily win; the
league will present at least two finalists to the 30 owners next
Tuesday, and a winner will have to be approved by at least 23 of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But three groups declined to make second bids: Thomas Murdough
Jr., president of Step2, a toymaker, and Richard Jacobs, the
Cleveland Indians' majority owner, who had merged their efforts
last week, and Jeremy Jacobs, chairman of the food concessionaire
Delaware North and owner of the Boston Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers didn't work,'' Murdough said, citing cost overruns
at the stadium that have already reached $33 million, and other
financial unknowns. ``After $450 million, it didn't make sense, and
I got a good indication that some people would go over $500
million. I think common sense prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``You hope the people you're competing with are sane
enough and have enough business acumen. But I think a couple of
groups are going to go nutty.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, four remain: Lerner, Dolan, Wolstein and Howard Milstein,
the New York-based real estate mogul.
</P>
<P>
   The league inaugurated the financial hullabaloo in March when it
chose to revive the Browns as an expansion team and not as one
relocated from another city.
</P>
<P>
   It awakened Richard Jacobs to a new challenge. ``I'm like the
Dalmatian in the firehouse,'' he said last month. ``I hear the bell
and I'm off.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``There's a limit to anything. It depends on what
they want _ money or a good operator.''
</P>
<P>
   The league also decided not to set a minimum bid or a flat
expansion fee, letting the bidders set the market. In 1993, the
league charged Jacksonville and Carolina expansion fees of $140
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them evaluate the asset and the outstanding, unique
opportunity,'' Goodell said of the Browns' bidders. ``They are all
sophisticated investors who will submit the bid they feel will be
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Their evaluation is based on:
</P>
<P>
   _ A stadium lease that will put every dollar of revenue in the
owner's pocket, requiring him to pay only annual rent of $250,000
and the cost of operations. Everything else is his: gate receipts

   What if one bidder shucks financial sense with a pre-emptive
strike? ``If someone is that stupid, to bid more than it's worth,
that's a choice you have to make,'' Wolstein said. ``If a guy bids
too high, why would you want him as a partner?''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the bidders has done what he felt was necessary to boost
his bid. Some have hired public relations firms or have flown
around the country to schmooze with owners. Cosby made a tape for
Charles Dolan, who is putting together the financing for a group
whose general partner is his brother, Lawrence, a Cleveland lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Some have hired renowned football names. Dolan added Don Shula
as his prospective chief of football operations. Milstein is
bankrolling a group with the former Browns Paul Warfield and Calvin
Hill. Wolstein brought in Brown and said Mike McCormack, former
president of the expansion Carolina Panthers and an offensive
tackle for the Browns in the 1950s, will run the Browns if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   After being persuaded to bid by Carmen Policy, the former
president of the San Francisco 49ers, Lerner had to defend the
decision he made, as a limited partner of the old Browns, to advise
Modell to move to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I help him? Yes,'' Lerner said. ``Would he have moved
without me? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he described his urge to own the new Browns as ``an act
of conscience'' toward his adopted city.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn-born Lerner added, ``I feel I should make this
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dolans live with backing from Modell, who is
expected to lobby against Lerner, a former friend, next Tuesday.
``Art Modell has adopted us,'' Lawrence Dolan said. ``We can't help
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the NFL approved Modell's move in 1996 and
promised to put a team back in Cleveland, it created the Cleveland
Browns Trust, with a $15 million budget, to restore the team's
business to viability. There were no players, no coaches, no
advertisers and no games to play, yet a staff set to work in the
old team's training facility in Berea, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no blueprint,'' said Bill Futterer, the trust's
president. ``People ask, `How do you operate a team without any
players?'''
</P>
<P>
   Futterer said he had marketable stars the fans already loved.
They happen to be retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got Brian Sipe at quarterback, Jim Brown running and Paul
Warfield at receiver,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Futterer traveled through Ohio and other states to meet with
fans, ethnic groups, civic associations and fraternal organizations
_ in all, 289 personal appearances and 47,000 people. Initially,
the goal was to assuage anger felt toward Modell, then to assure
them of the Browns' return.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the outset, it was hard to separate us from Modell,'' he
said. ``They were angry. Not at the Browns. But at the NFL. At pro
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Television and radio programs were produced. Alumni flag
football games and charitable fund-raisers were staged. A Web site
was created. The rabid network of Browns Backers clubs was
resuscitated.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Futterer's goal was to sell. First came the personal
seat licenses, fees for the right to buy season tickets, with the
revenues to be used to repay the NFL's $63 million loan to help
build the stadium. ``We wanted them to feel that the people using
the stadium most would pay more than the taxpayers did,'' Futterer
said. Then came the season tickets, luxury suites and club seats.
</P>
<P>
   The trust hired scouts and player personnel executives, led by
Joe Mack, a former Carolina Panthers assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that has to do with football has to be ready by
January,'' Mack said. ``We're trying to build a successful team.''
</P>
<P>
   Mack's group is faced with developing a team in less than one
year, half the time the Carolina and Jacksonville expansion teams
had before taking the field for the 1995 season. Like everyone at
Berea, he knows he could be gone pretty soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst-case scenario is you're starting the building blocks
of a great franchise,'' he said. ``That's not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a third season starts in Cleveland without the Browns. The
``Dawg Pound'' of rabid, barking fans has dispersed. Sundays have
been empty, but life has gone on. The Indians' success has provided
partial solace, at least into October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Ohio State football on Saturday,'' said John
Kristofeld of Columbus, ``and spent quality time with my family on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn and Gary Brochetti of Euclid were die-hard Dawg Pounders.
For two years, they kept a box full of Browns T-shirts, caps and
other goods sealed. Across it, she wrote, ``Don't Open Until '99.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We survived,'' said Dawn Brochetti, a part-time probation
officer, ``but only because we knew the Browns were coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether money that was not spent on tickets and beer at
Municipal Stadium or munchies for TV-watching faithful was spent in
significant numbers on other pursuits in the region is not known.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably been a loss because of the absence of
transactions at the stadium and spending by high-salaried
athletes,'' said Chris Warren, the city's economic development
director. ``But that's been more than offset by the huge success of
the baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the old Browns contributed an estimated $77 million to
the local economy annually, Warren admitted that the team's
presence is important mainly as an asset to help civic image and
psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically, football isn't a big deal,'' Wolstein said.
``It's only 10 days a year. One factory with 250 people has more
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychic value of the Browns was displayed vigorously on Aug.
21, when the team staged a rally in a downtown mall to mark the
365th day before the new Browns' first preseason game. Fans lined
up to buy Browns caps, watches and tote bags. Children lined up for
autographs from John Thompson, a local superfan dubbed Big Dawg,
who wielded an oversized dog bone and barked from behind a hound
dog mask.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 former Browns _ from Marion Motley to Bob Golic to Lou
Groza _ who were introduced were greeted with whoops and cheers.
They descended a staircase, some limping, some wearing jerseys
stretched tautly over their paunches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it up for Ot-to Graham!'' the announcer roared for the
76-year-old quarterback. ``Now give it up for Gluefingers!'' he
said, and down the steps came receiver Dante Lavelli, now 75.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were celebrating the past, but on the podium sat four
former Browns seeking a piece of the future: Brown, Hill, Warfield
and McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting ready, right?'' bellowed Brown, wearing a Browns
home jersey with his familiar No. 32 and a kufi cap atop his shaved
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe?'' Warfield said. ``Do you believe?''

NORTH KOREA DRAWS ANGER WITH TEST OF A MISSILE 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Congressional leaders, already angered at
reports that North Korea may be building a new underground nuclear
weapons plant, responded Tuesday to the firing of a new
medium-range missile across Japan on Monday with threats to cut off
all food aid and other assistance to the North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, the Japanese suspended aid to North Korea and put off
talks on normalizing relations, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They fired a shot across Japan's bow and therefore across ours
too,'' said Sen. Gordon H. Smith, R-Ore., as the Senate moved to
toughen the certification required of President Clinton before
money can be released for a nuclear energy program given to North
Korea in return for pledges not to build weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is now the largest donor of food to the
famine-plagued North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   An American delegation has been holding talks this week in New
York on nuclear issues, including the intelligence reports of a
possible new weapons factory, with North Korean diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans failed to show up for Tuesday's meeting,
saying they were awaiting new instructions from their government.
American officials said the Korean diplomats were surprised and
embarrassed by the missile test on Monday, indicating that they are
far from the power loop in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first firing of a new class of ballistic missile, the
Taepodong-1, which has now proved itself capable of hitting Japan.
Japanese ships and planes were searching for the wreckage of the
missile Tuesday in the Sea of Japan, 240 miles off the Noto
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the leader of the North Korean delegation, Kim Gye
Kwan, also failed to attend a scheduled meeting with Rep. Benjamin
A. Gilman, R-N.Y., who is chairman of the House International
Relations Committee. This was the second time within a week that
Kim agreed to meet Gilman here but then did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman, speaking at a news conference Tuesday afternoon at the
United States Mission to the United Nations, said that the talks
were at ``a very critical juncture.'' He had been briefed by the
American delegation leader, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State
Charles Kartman, but would not discuss details of the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Talks with the North Koreans are always held in almost total
seclusion, without any public comment by the Americans. The North
Koreans are seen as a very skittish and unpredictable team,
representative of the world's most secretive regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been supporting the ongoing talks,'' Gilman said, ``but
unless there is going to be an agreement that meets congressional
requirements, the support in the Congress will dissipate.''
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans have complained that Congress is already
holding up millions of dollars in disbursements of American
contributions to the $6 billion energy program supported by the
United States, South Korea and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Gilman said Tuesday that Congress was demanding tighter
surveillance of North Korea and a higher level of cooperation from
Pyongyang, where Kim Jong Il, the son of the late dictator, Kim Il
Sung, is expected to be inaugurated as president next week.
President Clinton is required to certify that North Korea is not
violating its agreement to stop developing and exporting weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Gilman's aides, Mark Kirk and Peter Brookes, who just
returned from a trip to North Korea to assess the food situation,
issued a report Tuesday that documented the existence of ``hunger
prisons,'' where people caught foraging for food are confined.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk said that the outside world is now feeding 7 million of
North Korea's 22 million people _ including all children under 7,
the elderly and hospital patients. He described the military as a
powerful institution still able to override civilian officials.
Under a Stalinist-style command economy, North Korea has all but
ceased to function as an industrial or agricultural nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've supported food aid to North Korea in the past to save
lives,'' Gilman said Tuesday. ``But that kind of assistance cannot
continue forever without some basic reforms in the North Korean
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington Tuesday, Republicans were bitter in their attacks
on the Clinton administration for not freezing cooperation with
North Korea. &QL;

COLLEGE BOARD INITIATES STUDY ON INFLATED GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM H. HONAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling it evidence of persistent grade inflation in American
high schools, College Board officials said Tuesday that more
college-bound students had A averages than a decade ago, but they
scored lower on their SAT exams.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board, which sponsors the SAT, said that test takers
with A averages grew from 28 percent of the total to 38 percent in
the last 10 years, but the SAT scores of those students fell an
average of 12 points on the verbal portion, to 505, and 3 points on
math, to 512.
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between grades and the SAT, the nation's leading
standardized college entrance test, is sufficiently troubling that
the president of the College Board, Donald Stewart, said the
organization has commissioned a Rand Corp. study of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know why grades are rising,'' Stewart said. ``The
trend may reflect positive changes in education, but it may also
reflect greater focus on personal qualities instead of academic
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, SAT scores remained about the same this year as last:
512 on the math portion, a point above last year and the highest in
years, and 505 on the verbal portion, the same as last year. The
figures were released Tuesday in the College Board's annual report
on the 1.2 million students who took the SAT before they graduated
from high school last spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Board also reported that substantially greater numbers of
high school students are taking the test and that more were
enrolled in advanced placement courses, making them eligible for
college credit before enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said the scores revealed two troubling trends. One is
that suburban students are improving their SAT scores, while urban
and rural students are falling further behind, with a 30-point gap
between urban and suburban students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This growing disparity is particularly troublesome,'' Stewart
said, ``because 40 to 50 percent of African-American and Latino
students who take the SAT live in large cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, the SAT scores of the children of parents with less
education are falling further below the national average, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   These conclusions were based on the College Board's analysis of
the 1.2 million seniors who took the SAT1: Reasoning Test, and
321,000 who took college-level Advanced Placement Examinations
before graduation from high school last June.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of continuing grade inflation comes at a time when
many states are requiring schools to adopt higher standards, though
sometimes grading the students on the basis of portfolios of their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``More subjectivity is going into assessments,'' Stewart said.
``This also could be the result of the increased emphasis on
accountability by teachers. That is, since teachers are supposed to
be teaching better they are giving out phony grades in an
unconscious effort to show themselves well _ something that is
exploded by the SAT tests.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Schaeffer, a spokesman for Fairtest, a longtime critic of
testing services, warned that the prevalence of grade inflation
should not be taken as an argument that the SAT ``keeps the process
honest.'' He said that proponents of the SAT ``admit that high
school performance is a better predictor of how someone will do at
college than is the SAT.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, the
nation's largest union with 2.4 million members, cautioned against
blaming teachers for grade inflation. ``If it's happening,'' he
said, ``no one could be supportive of that, but it may result from
pressures from both parents and the schools. We just don't know.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seppy Basili, a spokesman for Kaplan Educational Centers, the
largest test preparation company in the nation, said ``grade
inflation is here to stay,'' and may be explained in part by the
popularity of advanced-placement courses. ``Students who do well in
AP courses may receive a weighted grade which is higher than an
A,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Everson, the College Board's chief research scientist,
said that the increased number of students taking the test is
``good news for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that there is a growing cohort of those who aspire to
attend a competitive college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Basili attributed the rise in math scores over the last four
years to a rule change that permitted students to bring along their
calculators when taking the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having their calculators made them feel comfortable, and
helped them to avoid making sloppy mistakes,'' Basili said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also said that even though there were growing gaps in
the scores of urban and suburban students, there was relatively
good news for minorities. ``Despite the recent backlash against
affirmative action, racial and ethnic minorities continue to see
college as the route to a better life,'' he said. ``This year,
minority students are a record one-third of the SAT population and
28 percent of AP graduates, and more of them aspire to master's and
Ph.D. degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Connerly, a black trustee of the University of California
who has long opposed affirmative action, said he sees the increased
number of racial and ethnic minorities who take the test as a
welcome indication of their growing confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this really represents is that with the demise of
preferences in California and Texas, and soon the entire nation,
blacks and Latinos are beginning to realize that they can make it
without preferences.'' Connerly said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart faulted Connerly for failing to seek an alternative to
affirmative action to equalize educational opportunity. Stewart
said he, too, would oppose preferences, ``but only if we can find a
way to create equal educational opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   In another trend reflected in this year's tests, many students'
career aspirations seemed out of step with the prospect for jobs in
the years ahead. Student test takers were asked to check off on
questionnaires the careers they hope to pursue. Labor Department
projections indicate that the top three occupations expected to
grow most rapidly between now and 2006 are computer-related. Yet
relatively few students (5 percent) checked off computing and
information sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Students' first career choice was health and allied services (18
percent), followed by business and commerce (14 percent) and social
sciences and history (11 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The SAT was taken by 43 percent of all high school graduates, or
about 1.2 million students.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board is the nonprofit educational association that
sponsors the SAT, which is developed and administered by the
Educational Testing Service. The SAT is the dominant test on the
Atlantic and Pacific coasts. The ACT is more popular in the central
United States.

 Aviron's Stock Sickly on Delay of Flu-Mist   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
While most stocks bounced back yesterday, shares of Mountain View's
Aviron plummeted 42 percent after the company disclosed that it
might not be able to roll out its nasal-spray flu vaccine in time
for the 1999 flu season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fall, which saw Aviron's stock drop from $21.69 to $12.50,
was the fourth-biggest on U.S. stock markets, which have grown
increasingly intolerant of any bad news.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not suggest that
Aviron's FluMist is not safe or effective, only that the company
needed to submit more information about its manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
   However, that conceivably could require an additional six-month
clinical trial and delay the launch of the first inhaled flu
vaccine until the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were hoping that the FDA would review the vaccine in time
for the 1999 flu season, which would mean a launch around September
1999,'' said Aviron CEO J. Leighton Read.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that most of the additional information the FDA has
requested already was planned for submission in October. It
involves data about blending the ingredients and filling them into
sprayers at a contract production facility in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to work closely with the FDA to enable the earliest
possible review,'' said Read. He suggested there is ``a reasonable
chance'' that no new clinical trials will be required and that
Aviron still will be able to launch FluMist next September.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and investors have been eagerly awaiting Aviron's first
product. Phase-three clinical trials with 1,600 children at 10 U.S.
sites in 1996 and 1997 showed that FluMist was 93 percent effective
in preventing flu. Only 1 percent of the children who inhaled the
vaccine got the flu, compared with 18 percent who sniffed a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expected Aviron to sell about 5 million doses of
FluMist next fall for close to $10 a pop. David Molowa of Bear
Stearns expected $36.5 million of FluMist sales next year and $257
million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's dramatic sell-off of Aviron stock, which erased $144
million of shareholder value, could be an overreaction. ``This is
not a justified drop in market value,'' Mehta Partners analyst Tom
Brakel told Bloomberg News. ``This has nothing to do with the
safety and efficacy of the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviron isn't the only firm making potions to protect against the
influenza virus. Flu shots, which have been around for years and
cost about $10, are effective 60 to 90 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Aviron, BioChem Pharma of Canada is working on a nasal
spray to treat flu. And Gilead Sciences of Foster City and
Hoffman-La Roche are working on an oral drug.

<P>
   You're Larry Dierker. You manage the Astros. You're a bright
guy. (You're also a cool guy. According to ``Ball Four,'' you sang
``Rocky Racoon'' between innings of a heroic game you once
pitched.) You wake up this morning and here's what you do:
</P>
<P>
   You knock on Randy Johnson's door and say, ``Une (short for
Unit, his nickname), you look a little peaked to me. We've been
working you too hard. And this stock market _ who can figure it
out? Anyway, I've made a decision. You've got the night off. You're
not pitching. I'm the manager, and I know best.''
</P>
<P>
   And just maybe you, being the bright and cool Larry Dierker, do
know. Tonight's game means nothing. All tonight does is give the
Braves a sneak peak at the guy they'll likely have to beat to reach
the World Series. Sneak peaks are fine for HBO, but not for you.
Heading toward October, you'd like every advantage you can muster.
Your biggest advantage is the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are a seasoned bunch. They've seen pretty much
everything, but they haven't seen Johnson. (Oh, a few of them have,
but only a few. And not when it really mattered.) Save him for
later. Make him the world's most conspicuous surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Let the Braves spend a fitful night wondering how it is,
standing in against the Big Unit. History tells us that one
dominant pitcher can swing a postseason series. One dominant
pitcher with a touch of mystery about him can also utterly unnerve
a superior team. (Think Mike Scott against the Mets. Think Tim
Wakefield against these Braves.) Your team may well be better than
the Braves as is, but why risk shortchanging yourself?
</P>
<P>
   Even a pedestrian pitcher has a disproportionate edge when first
he sees a hitter. (If you doubt, check the Braves' lamentable
record against rookies.) There's nothing pedestrian about the Unit.
Remember how he famously cowed the crusty John Kruk in the All-Star
Game? Kruk hadn't seen him before. Now imagine a lineup of Kruks.
Imagine the trepidation that will come with being favored (which
the Braves will be) yet knowing the opposition has this immense
hidden asset.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Bobby Cox said Tuesday: ``I'd rather see the guy,
sure. ... It lets you know how he's throwing.'' The difference
between facing Randy Johnson for the second time as opposed to the
first may be ... what? Two more hits the second time around? Three
more? In the postseason any hit can be huge.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, events could render all this cogitation moot. The Braves
could lose to the Cubs. You could lose to the Padres. But the
manager of any playoff-bound National League club must assume that
at some point he'll run across the Braves. Maybe you hadn't given
this hoard-the-Unit ploy much thought until Tuesday, but now you
have. And the more you consider it, the more sense it makes.
</P>
<P>
   You're Larry Dierker. You know your men. You care about their
welfare. And you can hear from the rasp (wink, wink) in the Unit's
throat that he's coming down with something. You give him a blanket
and two aspirin and orders to watch the game from the clubhouse.
Tonight you don't really need him. But soon enough you will.

IS SILVER LINING FALLING INTEREST RATES? NOT ON MORTGAGE RATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street's recent turmoil is supposed to have a silver
lining: falling interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But mortgage buyers haven't seen them yet.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rates paid on Treasury notes have fallen throughout
the summer, and their decline accelerated in the past week as the
stock market tumbled. Yet the rates for home mortgages are holding
firm, sticking near the same 7 percent level where they started the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply the limits of supply and demand,'' said Keith
Gumbinger, vice president for HSH Associates, a lending market
research firm in Butler, N.J. ``Lenders are moving mortgage
products as fast as they can finish the paperwork. They're not
cutting rates, because they don't have any reason to.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage lenders, who are on track for record business this
year, said investors are starting to balk at buying additional
mortgage-backed securities because so many loans already have been
written.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors believe that rates could decline, leading to a
wave of refinancings that would undercut their returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the point where there's more demand for mortgages and
less interest in owning them as investments,'' said David Motley,
executive vice president of Fort Worth Mortgage, the largest
mortgage company in Tarrant County. ``In terms of (mortgage) volume
and (interest rate) yield, we've reached the gagging point.''
</P>
<P>
   By contemporary standards, mortgage rates remain very
attractive. But inflation has been so low for so long that analysts
have said that a sharp reduction appears to be justified.
</P>
<P>
   If mortgage rates fell half a percentage point, a torrent of new
capital would be unlocked for consumers who could refinance their
mortgages or look for new homes.
</P>
<P>
   On a $100,000 loan, a homeowner would save about $400 a year by
reducing the mortgage rate from 7 percent to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But lenders said it is dangerous to bet that rates will fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not likely to get much better than this,'' Motley said.
``The odds of a rate increase are much greater. From this level,
there's a lot more downside than upside.''
</P>
<P>
   Rates climbed slightly Tuesday, as the stock market recovered
and investors appeared to take a pass on low-yielding bond
investments. The rates paid for 10-year Treasuries rose to 5.06
percent, from 4.98 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But that is still low enough to justify a further cut in
mortgages, Gumbinger said.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, when mortgages hit their lowest level in 30
years, HSH reported the average 30-year mortgage at 6.83 percent.
At the end of last week, when HSH completed its most recent
national survey, the 10-year Treasury was lower than in October
1993, but the average mortgage was 7.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for 30-year mortgages typically track the rates paid on
10-year Treasuries, not 30-year Treasury notes, because most home
loans are paid off in about seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this decade, the average spread between 10-year
Treasuries and 30-year mortgages has been about 1.5 percentage
points. Last week, as Treasury rates fell and mortgages held firm,
the spread hit 1.82 percentage points, the largest gap since
February 1990, Gumbinger said.
</P>
<P>
   But like Motley, he doesn't suggest that consumers wait for
mortgages to fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you can convince hundreds of thousands of neighbors to
stop buying homes and refinancing their mortgages, you're not
likely to see much of a decline,'' Gumbinger said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, mortgage originations hit a record high of $1.1
trillion, he said. This year, they are on pace to top $1.3
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The Mortgage Bankers Association of America forecasts that
mortgage rates will hit bottom by the end of this month, and then
rise slowly next year.
</P>
<P>
   The savvy strategy, experts said, is to lock in today's rates
with a true no-cost loan. In that case, borrowers pay an interest
rate that is about half a percentage point higher than the market
rate in exchange for having the lender cover all the closing costs.
</P>
<P>
   If rates fall later, they can refinance again, without worrying
about recouping out-of-pocket expenses such as origination fees,
discount points and survey costs _ expenses that can top $3,000 on
many loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people just get stuck on getting a certain interest rate,
even though it may take them years and years to make it pay off,''
said Judith O. Smith, owner of the Judith O. Smith Mortgage Group.
``It may make sense to them psychologically, but it just doesn't
work financially.''

COAST GUARD FACES SUIT OVER TOXIC BATTERIES IT DUMPED IN LAKES AND
RIVERS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ The U.S. Coast Guard, responsible for
policing the nation's navigable waterways, has for decades dumped
toxic batteries into rivers and lakes and has only half-heartedly
tried to clean up its mess, say environmentalists and anglers who
are behind a federal lawsuit intended to force the service to
retrieve the batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard has long acknowledged that, since the 1950s, as
many as 100,000 dead batteries taken from lighted towers and other
navigation markers, like buoys, under its jurisdiction were dumped
into the Tennessee River, the Hudson River and other waterways
throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, one of the Coast Guard's duties is to enforce
laws about illegal dumping, but batteries containing lead, mercury,
sulfuric acid and other chemicals listed as toxic by the
Environmental Protection Agency were routinely dumped into some of
the nation's most scenic waterways, said John Cronin, executive
director of Riverkeeper Inc., a New York environmental group,
which, as required by law, has notified the Coast Guard of its
intent to file suit.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and anglers from Alabama to Alaska have joined
in an effort to force the Coast Guard to remove the batteries,
which can be bigger than a car battery and weigh as much as 50
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard, which contends that leakage from the batteries
poses no health risk to people or to marine plants and animals, has
said that it has a plan to remove some of the batteries. But the
plan, which largely ignores batteries from buoys anchored in deep
water and those broken or buried in mud, will clean up only half of
them, at best, environmentalists maintain.
</P>
<P>
   The planned lawsuit asks the federal courts to take over
supervision of the cleanup, and would require the Coast Guard,
which maintained the navigation aids, to complete an environmental
impact study.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Guard officials, who did not respond to requests for an
interview, have said many of the batteries either do not leak or
are buried in mud. They have estimated that it will cost as much as
$60 million to remove the batteries from the lakes and rivers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Coast Guard has said that it stopped dumping the batteries
in the early 1970s after learning that the chemicals in the
batteries were not environmentally safe. But, environmentalists
say, in Alabama, divers with the Alabama Marine Police have dragged
batteries up from lake beds that were stamped with Coast Guard
identifications and dated as late as 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard has used divers to retrieve some of the
batteries in lakes like Lake Guntersville, Ala., on the Tennessee
River, but environmentalists contend that the number of batteries
the service says it is finding, and the risk they represent, is far
less than reality.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin said the 100,000 batteries the Coast Guard had said it
dumped do not include those from floating buoys, which represent
tens of thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the guardians of our waterways, the principal
policemen for the navigable waters of America,'' said Ray Scott,
the founder of the Bass Angler Sportsman's Society in Alabama and
one of 25 plaintiffs who this week notified the Coast Guard that
they would file a lawsuit in New York City against the service in
60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Anglers like those who make up the Alabama Bass Federation have
long worried about mercury contamination in the state's waterways,
and believe that the batteries contribute to that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, anyone suing
over illegal dumping must file a notice of intent 60 days before
filing the actual lawsuit, to give those named in the suit time to
clean up the chemicals and avoid litigation.
</P>
<P>
   One battery might not be a threat, Cronin said, but he added
that a pile of as many as 200, like one found near Iona Island on
the Hudson, had to be a threat.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said the Coast Guard's decision to remove only some of the
batteries meant that at least half of the batteries submerged in
the Hudson would be left. ``No industry would get away with that
kind of cleanup,'' he said.

COWBOYS RELEASE RECEIVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Jimmy Smith. Tim Daniel. Kevin Williams. Willie
Jackson. Edward Hervey. Anthony Miller. Macey Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed each hoping to find a running mate for
Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   Each is running plays for another team, or has been run out of
football.
</P>
<P>
   Add Stepfret Williams to the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys released their third-round pick from the 1996 draft
yesterday, the eighth draftee or high-priced free agent the club
has been unable to develop into a dependable wide receiver since
drafting Alvin Harper in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey announced Williams' release minutes
before the club's kickoff luncheon to introduce the 1998 team to
sponsors at Hotel Intercontinental in North Dallas. Williams was
waived, Gailey said, to make room for running back Sherman
Williams, who was re-signed to back up Emmitt Smith while Chris
Warren is out for at least a month with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the Cowboys will make more roster moves
before Sunday's season opener against the Arizona Cardinals, team
owner Jerry Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams caught 30 passes for 308 yards and one touchdown as the
club's third-down wide receiver in 1997. He caught six passes for
69 yards in preseason and added six kickoff returns for 150 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams was undependable in preseason, dropping ``more
balls than I thought he would,'' Gailey said. And at 6 feet, 170
pounds, Williams is small for the blocking role that the Cowboys
ask of their third- and fourth-team wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Late in preseason, Cowboys coaches had moved H-back Eric
Bjornson ahead of Williams in the four-receivers set.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' release means that the Cowboys will begin the season
with five wide receivers: Irvin, Billy Davis, Ernie Mills, Jeff
Ogden and Patrick Jeffers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, Mills, Ogden and Jeffers combined for 17 receptions for
184 yards and one touchdown in 1997. Jimmy Smith, who played for
the Cowboys in 1992, caught 82 passes for 1,324 yards and four
touchdowns for the Jacksonville Jaguars last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep working at it,'' Cowboys vice president Stephen
Jones said of the club's bad luck with wide receivers. ``But
sometimes when you change systems, it can affect your personnel.
Stepfret may have fallen into that category. We ask our receivers
to do a lot of blocking. We ask them to be real physical with all
of the crossing routes. Step was more of a finesse guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, like seven before him, he's a gone guy.
Cowboys spotlight How are the Cowboys preparing to stop mobile
Cardinals quarterback Jake Plummer, who reminds former 49ers coach
Bill Walsh of Joe Montana?
</P>
<P>
   Because of Deion Sanders and Kevin Smith, the Cowboys should do
a good job covering Plummer's primary targets, Rob Moore and Frank
Sanders. It's Plummer's running ability that worries coaches.
Expect linebacker Dexter Coakley to act as a ``spy'' on Plummer in
short-yardage passing situations. Safety Omar Stoutmire will
probably be used as the spy in long-yardage passing situations. _

MEXICAN CHIEF SAYS PAINFUL ECONOMIC POLICIES ARE FARSIGHTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President Ernesto Zedillo on Tuesday night made
his first major statement about the effects of the world financial
crisis on Mexico. Zedillo acknowledged that plunging oil prices had
forced painful budget cuts and urging Mexicans to be patient and
work hard to help the country continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must be the first to warn that the circumstances in which
our economy will operate in the near future will be difficult,''
Zedillo said in his annual state of the union address. But Mexico
can expect to average 4 percent growth for the two years that
remain in his six-year term, he said, ``as long as we keep our
spirits high and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong speech that defended his government's efforts to
solve everything from surging crime to illiteracy, Zedillo devoted
the most time to explaining his often-painful economic policies,
arguing that they had so far helped Mexico to bend, but not break,
with the global financial pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary recent losses in the Mexican financial markets
after Russia's de facto devaluation of the ruble surrounded
Zedillo's report to Congress with an air of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and analysts of all stripes delivered their own
assorted report cards on the president's performance in his four
years in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quick look at the economic indicators reveal that our
country is sustaining itself on the pillars of deceit and the
people's poverty,'' Sen. Gabriel Jimenez Remus of the opposition
National Action Party told the Congress hours before Zedillo's
address. ``Falling per capita income, rising inflation, the
devaluation of our currency, ever rising unemployment _ all are
shoving our country toward the third world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifth Year Begins in Financial Crisis'' was the headline
Tuesday in the newspaper Reforma. The paper featured a poll that
showed that 51 percent of Mexicans approved Zedillo's presidency,
down from 60 percent in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zedillo's approval ratings have begun to decline,'' the
newspaper reported, ``and the president's fall has been caused by
the poor pace of the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Zedillo is more popular than the opposition mayor of
Mexico City, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, and about half the 31 state
governors.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 peso devaluation, during Zedillo's first month in
office, provoked a worldwide financial crisis and plunged Mexico
into recession. But the tight-money policies and fiscal discipline
that he imposed after that brought the broad economic indicators
back to healthy growth in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The new economic turbulence, originating in Asia, has been
washing over Mexico since July, when plunging world oil prices
forced Zedillo to preside over the third severe budget cut this
year. Soon the peso, which opened the year worth 12.4 U.S. cents,
began to slide. At the close of trading Monday the peso was worth
10.03 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates have climbed, to 38 percent in the secondary
markets.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican markets were closed Tuesday for a national holiday, the
Day of the presidential Report.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying that the president is weakened,'' Sergio
Sarmiento, news director of the TV Azteca network, wrote in a
newspaper column.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, with a certain degree of truth, that the
international financial crisis is eroding the only point about
which Zedillo could claim success, his handling of the
macroeconomy. Everything else seems to be in disaster. But this
isn't the first time Mr. Zedillo has been portrayed erroneously as
defeated.''

PLAYING SPARINGLY GIVES STARTERS LITTLE TIME TO MASTER NEW OFFENSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Last week's nine-play outing against the
Jacksonville Jaguars underscored how little the Cowboys' first-team
offense has been on the field this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While Chan Gailey protected his stars from injury with limited
contact, you wonder if the strategy stunted their mental growth.
</P>
<P>
   Did center Clay Shiver get enough time in exhibition games to
know who to block when the end stunts and the cornerback comes up
the middle on a blitz? Will Troy Aikman know where Ernie Mills is
supposed to be in his pass pattern when Michael Irvin and Billy
Davis are covered? Will Daryl Johnston know which linebacker to
pick up when Emmitt Smith gets the toss sweep?
</P>
<P>
   It was one thing to hold Emmitt, Michael, and Troy out of
preseason games during the Barry Switzer era, especially when each
knew the offense better than Barry. It's another thing to keep the
threesome off the field when they are still trying to decipher
Gailey's complex system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've gotten enough work,'' says Irvin, who along with
the rest of the first team played a quarter in four preseason games
and a half against the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
   But, Irvin adds, ``It's my 11th year and I'm like a baby, just
trying to absorb things. In the old offense, I knew it like the
coaches. Right now, there are coverages where I don't know who is
getting the ball. I can line up on the right side and I'm
wondering, `Troy, come on now, are you going to throw it to me, or
what? I just haven't learned that. \RDuring practice\S when Chan
walks over and whispers \Ra play\S in Troy's ear, I'm trying to
peep me a whisper, too. I'm still learning.''
</P>
<P>
   That learning must come in the season opener against the Arizona
Cardinals on Sunday. Team owner Jerry Jones is just glad he doesn't
have to learn to live without Irvin, Emmitt and Troy because of a
preseason injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had a successful preseason because we're able to
put our best players out on the field on opening day,'' Jones said,
``I know we've got the work in that was needed in practice, and
that was important. Everybody likes to win \Rin the preseason\S,
but if that, in any way, meant one additional injury, I wouldn't
have wanted to win. We see it with Chris Warren and the impact that
it has on us by not having him.'' Welcome to the big leagues
Seventh-round draft pick Tarik Smith said neither he nor his
parents could sleep until he made the final roster. ``It was
nerve-racking,'' he said of the nightly phone calls from his folks
this summer. ``They didn't know if they were going to have to come
get me or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's job status is still uncertain. Yesterday, the Cowboys
re-signed Sherman Williams to be Emmitt Smith's primary backup
until Warren returns in a month from a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Until Williams was signed, Tarik Smith was to get most of the
action as the third-down running back. And as he sat in his locker
Saturday, Emmitt Smith and Nate Newton personally made sure that
Tarik Smith was aware of his task.
</P>
<P>
   Nate: ``Tarik, you know you are the No. 2 guy right now. Let's
get your stuff together.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarik: ``I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt: ``Yeah, Nate. I've already talked to him. \RLooking at
Tarik\S. We can't be half-stepping. When I'm tired, I'm going to
need to come out of the game. This isn't going to be like last
year, when they didn't want me to come out. Michael \RIrvin\S was
always saying to me, `Come on, Emmitt, one more play. One more
play.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nate: ``Yeah, man. When you play tired, that's how you get hurt.
Then nobody knows how hurt you really are. Then when you mess up,
they give you a bad grade, the media gives you a bad grade.''
Inside the locker room When the Cowboys made their final roster cut
to 53 last weekend, the added locker space wasn't the only reason
to smile. Said Aikman, ``No. 1, you get rid of a lot of guys that
are not going to be here. There are a lot of guys not real
committed and they know their time is running out and they start
having a little more fun than they need to be having.'' ... If Tony
Tolbert and Mark Tuinei give up rehabbing injuries to try to return
to the Cowboys, vice president Stephen Jones said the team would
give each a big send-off, retirement gala just like the one Jay
Novacek and Charles Haley received. ... Michael Irvin and Randall
Godfrey were named to the NFL's all-strength team by ``Muscle &AMP;
Fitness'' magazine.
YARD MARKERS: How far do the Cowboys have to go? First and 10 Jerry
Jones says part of the reason a Herschel Walker decision is being
delayed is because ``... Herschel wants to get to a Super Bowl.''
Could Herschel be thinking the Cowboys don't have a chance to make
the Super Bowl this year? We asked Jerry for confirmation on

said, ``This isn't just a note, or a brief. The Cowboys don't get
the grief alone.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I was lolling at home Tuesday morning, watching
Howie Mandel, a talk-show host, ask Rosie O'Donnell, another
talk-show host who was his guest, about her summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the program was interrupted for an ABC News Special
Report. Had something happened to President Clinton? Was Russia no
more? Had Monica and her mother signed a $10 million book deal?
</P>
<P>
   No, Peter Jennings had broken in for a live report on the
opening of the New York Stock Exchange. The anchor somehow managed
to miss the opening bell and lose his remote feed from the trading
floor. But he conveyed the import of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   America's twin obsessions _ money and sex _ were captured most
hilariously Monday when CNN put a little stock ticker to the left
of Trent Lott as he chastised Bill Clinton for diminishing the
presidency. It was impossible to focus on the Senate majority
leader's moral umbrage with the Dow plummeting 110 points right
next to his helmet head.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't concerned about the market. I had already sold my
paltry cache of stock to buy summer dresses. I thought I would wear
the dresses to parties. But there are no parties. Washington is
twitching through what is universally deemed the unsexiest sex
scandal in its history. People here are too busy mucking around in
others' private lives to enjoy their own.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I got to work, the market was healing. But something
else really, really scary had happened _ the AP wire was running a
story about Dan Burton's sex life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dan Burton's sex life. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Just when you thought this scandal had hit rock bottom, the
bottom got rockier. Thank you, Ken Starr, for wiring up Linda Tripp
and for creating a nation of Peeping Toms, for dragging us down to
the point where we have to hear the sex secrets of crepuscular
Republican swamp life.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Burton was trying to pre-empt any damaging personal
revelations in an upcoming Vanity Fair profile by confessing rough
times in his marriage. ``If something comes out . . . that you
think Danny shouldn't have done,'' Danny said, ``I will own up to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Starr's eagerness to get something, anything, on Bill Clinton
to justify his overwrought investigation, the prosecutor has opened
a sewer of TMI _ Too Much Information.
</P>
<P>
   Clintonites have long threatened a bedroom Doomsday strategy.
Salon, an online magazine sympathetic to the White House, suggested
why the House speaker has been restrained about Monica. ``Gingrich,
lest we forget, has a closet full of sexual misconduct,'' wrote
Stephen Talbot.
</P>
<P>
   I dread to think what's next. Dick Armey's sex life? TMI. Phil
Gramm's sex life? Way TMI.
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable, in a capital with such a lush history of sex,
that a president might have to leave office for covering up an
affair.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the rules of politics were very simple. As the
Democratic strategist Raymond Strother summed it up: ``If a
politician stayed on his bar stool, he wasn't drunk. And if he
didn't get caught, he wasn't cheating on his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   But for several years before Clinton came to town, it was clear
that a gallows had gone up along the Potomac. With journalists
willing to report more, with women coming into power more, the old
libertine rules were vitiated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, former Sen. John Tower's nomination to be defense
secretary went down, amid opprobrium about his skirt-chasing and
hard drinking, even though he promised to give up alcohol, and even
though some senators came to the floor to vote against him with
liquor on their breath.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone realized then, as one GOP consultant put it, that
hypocrisy was going to be punished with more hypocrisy. John White,
a former Democratic official, lamented that ``there used to be
better ways to gut a guy besides putting his personal mores through
the meat grinder.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Drury, the author of ``Advise and Consent,'' mocked the
new morality to me: ``One must tell all and promise all and be a
good, good, good boy and promise to be a good, good, good boy
forever after.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton knew the rules had drastically changed. He promised
to be a good, good boy. But he wasn't. It was a dangerous game. He
lost and so did we. Even if the President escapes the gallows on
the Potomac, we will be the world capital of TMI for seasons to
come.

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: The waiting begins for 'Big Cat'
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Andres Galarraga had his day in court Tuesday and will
hear from National League president Len Coleman today on the appeal
of his three-game suspension for brawling with Los Angeles pitcher
Darren Dreifort Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he's keeping it as many days or taking some
days off,'' Galarraga said. ``I'll wait. I tell you, I don't want
any day suspension for that.''
</P>
<P>
   That possibility is remote. If anything, Coleman may reduce the
suspension by a game. But appeals on mound-charging incidents are
rarely successful. The appeal was made in a meeting at the Braves
offices with Galarraga, Coleman, manager Bobby Cox, administrative
umpire director Paul Runge, and Bob Lenaghan, counsel for the
Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Coleman) understood a lot of it,'' Cox said. ``He
knew everything. We had the two tapes. It was very good.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes of the two times Dreifort hit Galarraga within six
days are the first baseman's ground for appeal. Dreifort hit him in
similiar situations (leading off the second inning) and the replays
included the exchange of words and gestures that followed the first
incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He listed to everybody,'' Galarraga said. ``He asked me if I
was hit before with a curveball or a change-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga served a three-game suspension Aug. 3-5 last year for
charging the mound after being struck by Dennis Cook, then pitching
for the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss out
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Walt Weiss is expected to miss a week after taking a
cortisone injection to his left quadriceps, which has troubled him
since late April. Having missed 50 games this year primarily due to
the quad or an earlier hamstring pull, the timing of the cortisone
treatment is geared to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought it up shortly after it first happened,'' Weiss said.
``At that point, they said they didn't like to do it with a fresh
injury because it can cause problems with the healing process and
make it worse ultimately. The question came up again today and we
just felt the timing was right. With about a month to go, it's been
nagging and nagging. Maybe this will get me over the hump.''
</P>
<P>
   The team was undecided over putting Weiss on the DL,
particularly since Class AA Greenville shortstop Mark DeRosa, the
top candidate to call up, isn't on the 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, campers
</P>
<P>
   The first batch of September call-ups arrived and were in
uniform Tuesday. Left-handed starter Bruce Chen and left-handed
reliever Odalis Perez were called up from Class AAA Richmond,
though the R-Braves season does not finish until Sept. 7.
Outfielder George Lombard also arrived from Greenville, thought he
commuted from Raleigh and drove from Greenville after arising at 4
a.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get down here before they changed their mind,''
said the Atlanta native. ``I was passing cops going about 85 mph.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond third baseman Wes Helms will be added to the club and
though Cox has not detailed playing plans, he is expected to give
Chen a start or two later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   A new Seanez
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Rudy Seanez rejoined the team Tuesday, after commuting
to El Centro, Calif., to be with wife Dianna for the Monday birth
of the couple's second daughter Lilianna (eight pounds). Labor was
delayed for several hours to allow for Seanez's arrival. He flew
back from San Diego Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Numbers
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker drove in 36 runs in the first half of the year.
Since the All-Star break, he had seven RBI, entering Tuesday night.
. . . Tony Graffanino is glad to see August end. The second baseman
hit .125 last month with over twice as many strikeouts (20) than
hits (8). . . . By going 18-10 in August, the Braves lost more
games than in month than any thus far. With four blown saves (three
in the last four games of the month), the bullpen also busted more
save opportunities than in June and July combined (3). . . . In his
first full month back with the team, reserve Greg Colbrunn had a
homer and six RBIs in 17 August at-bats. That matched left fielder
Ryan Klesko's output in 72 at-bats.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Houston Astros
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (17-6, 1.98 ERA;
17-8, 2.19 lifetime vs. Astros) vs. LHP Randy Johnson (5-1, 1.17;
0-1, 13.50 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: On May 7, 1989, Johnson was Montreal's starting pitcher
when the Expos played the Braves at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium.
He wasn't around for long, either, allowing six runs on four hits
and six walks before being pulled after four innings. Two days
later, he was banished to Class AAA, where he lanquished until May
27, when the Expos sent him to Seattle in a five-player deal for
Mark Langston. Once in Seattle, Johnson became the game's strikeout
artist of the decade, made the All-Star team five times in the next
nine seasons and grew to be every left-handed hitter's worst
nightmare. His only loss since returning to the NL came Aug. 17
against Philadelphia, which had the slender advantage of having
faced him 10 days before. He already has thrown three shutouts in
his six Astro starts, allowing a total of only six runs in 46
innings. He has surrendered 31 hits and struck out 61 batters.
Maddux, 5-4 in the second half, has seen his ERA rise nearly half a
run in his last four starts, in which he allowed 15 runs and 27
hits over 25 innings.

 &HT;    The miracle at East Lake
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Bermuda rough is deep and deadly. The greens are
firming up. The property is a lush, green tribute to what developer
Tom Cousins envisioned when he made the $25 million commitment to
restore Atlanta's historic East Lake Golf Club and revitalize the
surrounding neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Bobby Jones is up there somewhere, waggling a long iron
and smiling down on what has become an urban miracle.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two months, Oct. 29-Nov. 1, the PGA Tour's $4
million Tour Championship arrives at East Lake, which will become
the center of the golf world for the first time since the 1963
Ryder Cup matches commenced along Alston Drive. The top 30
money-winners will come to East Lake to battle for a $720,000 first
prize.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few years ago the neighborhood was in such turmoil that
they wouldn't have wanted to park there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tour Championship is only part of the story,'' Cousins
said this week at East Lake. ``An even larger story is the rebirth
of the East Lake neighborhood. ... Through the East Lake Community
Foundation and its many partners _ private and public _ the East
Lake area is once again becoming a vibrant and healthy
neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a project already a model for other urban areas of the
nation. New apartments stand where some of the city's most
frightening slum areas used to stand. Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell
said, ``There is no golf course that is as magnificent as East Lake
(is) that, in essence, stands adjacent to public housing, anywhere
in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Cousins employed Rees Jones to refurbish and restore the
original Donald Ross course that had slipped toward disrepair in
recent decades. Three years later, East Lake has returned to its
status as one of the nation's fine, classic courses. Although only
a handful of PGA Tour players _ Davis Love III, Stewart Cink, Billy
Andrade _ have played the redone product, defending champion David
Duval was saying Monday on a teleconference call, ``From what I
heard, it's an unbelievable track.''
</P>
<P>
   From its restored Tudor clubhouse to the zoysia fairways, East
Lake is as classy a setup as the tour players will ever see.
</P>
<P>
   The course will play to 6,980 yards for the tournament. For
those unfamiliar with East Lake, its signature hole is the par-3
6th, one of the first island holes in America, which will play to
164 yards and surely be a favorite viewing site. East Lake's 18th
also is a par 3 _ but 232 yards. Depending on the conditions, it
can be anything from a 3-wood to a 3-iron.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets are still available for the Tour Championship, which
probably will determine the 1998 money title, but attendance will
be limited to 25,000 per day. A limited number of daily tickets are
available at $25 for Monday-Wednesday and $40 for Thursday-Sunday
tournament rounds. Call 888-868-7849 for information. For
information on group packages, call 404-378-8687. All parking will
be free at Turner Field, a 10-minute ride from the course.

COURT DENIES NEW YORK CITY'S BID TO BAR HARLEM RALLY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court ruled on Tuesday that a rally
billed as the Million Youth March could take place in Harlem on
Saturday. But it also significantly curbed the scope of the event,
reducing the proposed duration to 4 hours from 12 and the number of
blocks to 6 from 29.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by a divided three-judge panel, balanced the
free-speech rights of the event's organizers against the concerns
of city officials who have tried to block the rally. They said they
feared it could be too large to manage, particularly when the
city's Police Department will be taxed by other Labor Day weekend
events.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the court's ruling was the acknowledgment by lawyers
for the organizers that they expect only 50,000 people, which is
significantly lower than previous estimates of 150,000 to three
million.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Wareham, one of the lawyers, attributed the drop to the
``climate of terror'' that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has created by
consistently referring to the event as a ``hate march.'' The
rally's lead organizer, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, has promoted it as
an expression of strength and unity by young black people, but he
has peppered his comments with the sort of anti-white and
anti-Semitic remarks for which he has repeatedly been criticized.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by two judges for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals _ with a third judge dissenting _ received mixed and
somewhat surprising reactions. Michael Hess, the city's corporation
counsel, hailed it as a significant victory and said the city had
no plans for further appeals. ButMalik Shabazz, a lawyer and close
adviser to Muhammad, sounded stunned when a reporter informed him
of the decision. ``Oh, that's crazy,'' he finally said. ``I have
nothing else to say, other than to say that we strongly disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, which supported the plans for the march, said the
court's decision to let the march proceed was ``a win for the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bitterness on both sides, Muhammad and his aides met
with city lawyers last night in an effort to work out final
arrangements for the rally.
</P>
<P>
   The decision signaled the latest and perhaps final clash between
the city and Muhammad over his plans for a rally in Harlem, one
that he says will attract entertainers, gang members interested in
ending lives of violence, and thousands of young black people from
around the country. But specifics have been few, and he has had to
compete with a much larger rally, the Million Youth Movement, also
taking place this weekend, in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has repeatedly denounced the rally and all those who
might participate. His comments have prompted several leaders in
Harlem to criticize the mayor as insensitive, and provided Muhammad
with an opportunity to spice his familiar anti-Semitic, anti-white
rhetoric with suggestions that invited gang members might fail to
contain themselves if the police try to stop the event.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's efforts to block the march, and to offer an
alternative of Randall's Island on Sept. 19, were undercut last
week when Judge Lewis Kaplan, of Federal District Court in
Manhattan, ruled that the city's denial of a rally permit for the
Labor Day weekend was unconstitutional and based on arbitrary
interpretations of city regulations. He also suggested that the
city had enough police officers ``to deal with whatever problems of
congestion, emergency action, overcrowding and fire risk may
arise'' during a 12-hour rally that would stretch 29 blocks along
Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the appeals court majority _ Judges Jon Newman and
Fred Parker _ upheld the lower court's decision to issue an
injunction allowing the event to take place in Harlem on Sept. 5.
But they argued that the ``invalidity of a permit regulation cannot
automatically entitle a plaintiff to hold its event precisely as it
wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the two judges found fault with Kaplan's assessment
of the city's ability to respond to the march, saying that the
lower court's decision ``exceeded the scope of its allowable
discretion.'' They said that the court ``cannot simply order
whatever a city is physically capable of doing, without regard to
considerations of public health, safety, convenience, and cost.''

</P>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Defensive end Andre Wadsworth, the No. 3
selection overall in the 1998 draft, might not be in the Arizona
lineup Sunday when the Cardinals open the season against the
Cowboys. The former Florida State star has not signed a contract,
and he was in New Jersey on Monday to watch the Seminoles defeat
Texas A&AMP;M in the Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   With or without Wadsworth, who is close to signing a contract,
Cowboys offensive tackle Erik Williams said his offensive linemates
cannot rest easy.
</P>
<P>
   Led by All-Pro defensive tackle Eric Swann, defensive end Simeon
Rice and defensive tackle Bernard Wilson, the Cardinals' defensive
front has routinely been a tough matchup for the Cowboys. Williams
said the outcome will probably hinge on what happens up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, Arizona has always had great talent on the
defensive line,'' Williams said. ``It'll be a tough battle, as it
always is.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the matchup more intriguing is the first test for a
Cowboys' offensive line that was revamped in the off-season after a
tumultuous 1997 season. The changes include moving All-Pro guard
Larry Allen to left tackle, the addition of Everett McIver to
replace Allen at right guard and the loss of more than 60 pounds by
left guard Nate Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Said Newton: ``We are going to put it all together against the
Cardinals.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Williams, putting it together means stopping Swann,
who recorded 7.5 sacks last season, and Rice, rated by some NFL
experts as one of the league's top young pass rushers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 6-foot-6 and 328 pounds, said Swann (6-5, 313) is a
handful. Williams said Swann will line up mainly against McIver and
center Clay Shiver, though Williams will face Swann at times on
line stunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a quick power guy,'' Williams said. ``He doesn't use
much finesse because he is so quick and strong. He is going to give
you everything you can handle. He's a man-child.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has been selected to the Pro Bowl three times,
said the key against the lightning-quick Rice is to stay on your
toes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy with a strong bull rush, quick up-the-field moves
and quick inside-spin moves,'' Williams said. ``You never know what
he's going to do.''

 &HT;    Another shot, quick, for Allen
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A few days ago, Robert Allen's shot at a middleweight
title mutated into a WWF moment. But now the Decatur, Ga. fighter
will get another chance at the IBF championship in 17 days _ in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, whose bout against IBF champion Bernard Hopkins Friday
was declared a no-contest when Hopkins fell out of the ring and
injured an ankle, will meet Antwun Echols for the ``interim'' IBF
belt Sept. 19 on the undercard of Evander Holyfield vs. Vaughn Bean
at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins was inadvertently pushed out of the ring by referee
Mills Lane when the fighters were being separated during a clinch.
Hopkins told a ring physician he could not continue, and the fight
was halted at 2:57 of the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative, and doctors said Hopkins' ankle was only
bruised, leading IBF president Bob Lee to mandate a rematch within
120 days. But Hopkins couldn't guarantee he could be ready in time,
leading promoter Don King to arrange a meeting between No. 1-ranked
Allen and No. 2 Echols. The winner will meet Hopkins later. But
Hopkins might vacate his belt for a bigger-money rematch with Roy
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   About the Hopkins fight, Allen said, ``That puzzled look you saw
on me after the fight, I still have it,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   WARMUP ACTS: The Holyfield-Bean undercard will include four
bouts with heavyweight contenders (Ray Mercer, Larry Donald, John
Ruiz and Jade Scott), rising Atlanta middleweight Lawrence Chapman
and a bantamweight title fight between WBO champion Jorge Eliecer
Julio and Adonis Cruz. ... Holyfield's first public workout
tentatively has been scheduled for noon next Wednesday at Atlanta's
CNN Center. ... Word is that 12,000 tickets have been sold, with an
advertising campaign to start today.

(JT) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Clinton delivered a sober lecture to Russian
leaders and the Russian people Tuesday about the hard realities of
capitalism and the price of international support for relief from
Russia's current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings with President Boris Yeltsin and the temporary
caretakers of Russia's paralyzed political and economic
institutions, and in a speech to students at a Moscow university,
Clinton warned that there is no easy escape from the financial
catastrophe that has closed banks, left millions of workers unpaid
and caused the collapse of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are enormous,'' Clinton told a group of students
and young business leaders at the Moscow State University for
International Relations this afternoon. ``Every choice Russia makes
today may have consequences for years and years to come. Given the
facts before you, I have to tell you that I do not believe there
are any painless solutions. And indeed, an attempt to avoid
difficult solutions may only prolong and worsen the present
challenges.'' The first day of Clinton's two-day visit to Moscow
was markedly muted, fitting for a summit meeting whose purpose was
far from clear, given Russia's turmoil and its lack of a
functioning government. Yeltsin's precarious political position and
Clinton's unresolved legal problems at home added to the sense of
gloom enveloping his trip.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's meetings with Yeltsin were businesslike and utterly
lacking in the back-slapping bonhomie that has characterized
several of their earlier meetings, officials said. The state dinner
Tuesday night broke up at 9:15 p.m. after barely an hour; in past
years such affairs have lasted well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The only concrete accords to be announced at the summit meeting
are agreements to reduce both nations' plutonium stockpiles and to
share data on ballistic missile launchings. Both were were
negotiated in the weeks leading up to the summit meeting, but even
after the accords are signed, the details of both remain to be
fleshed out.
</P>
<P>
   American officials considered canceling the long-planned summit
meeting because the prospects for meaningful progress were nil, but
decided late last week to proceed because they concluded that
abandoning the meeting would heap insult on Russia's multiple
internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The day was drab and rainy, unseasonably cold even for late
summer in Moscow. Clinton's solemn speech at the university _ the
only extended public remarks he will deliver on the visit _ matched
the mood of this sullen city. While he offered words of
encouragement and vows of friendship, the message was blunt and
bleak. Russia's creditors and its international partners, the
president said, will not tolerate a return to state control of
important industries, efforts to escape financial hardship by
printing rubles or special favors for cronies of powerful figures
in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to create a new Russia that benefits all
responsible citizens of this country,'' Clinton said in a 35-minute
address that was not once interrupted by applause. ``How do you get
there? I do not believe it is by reverting to the failed policies
of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then spelled out what he called ``the rules of the
road'' that Russia must follow if it wishes to become a modern
state in the global economy. They included a fair and consistent
tax collection system, anti-inflationary government monetary
policy, legal protections for property owners and investors, steps
to halt accelerating capital flight and an end to sweetheart deals
for the tycoons who dominate an increasing share of Russia's
legitimate and black-market economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not radical theories,'' Clinton said. ``They are
simply facts proven by experience. How Russia reacts to them will
fundamentally affect your future.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand-picked audience in the hall already agreed with most of
what Clinton had to say, said Yekaterina Drozdova, a recent
graduate of the university now working for the U.S. Agency for
International Development in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people present are already for all of that,'' she
said. ``He might better try to impose his influence on the powerful
structures.''
</P>
<P>
   She also mildly criticized Clinton for not speaking more
forthrightly about politics in Russia. ``The international
community should express an opinion on what is going on in our
country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Chernyshev, a physiologist in his late 20s, also agreed
with most of Clinton's views. ``What would you expect him to say?''
Chernyshev said. ``It was all kind of predictable. I think it's
just true.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's message to Yeltsin and to Viktor Chernomyrdin, the
acting prime minister, echoed that of his speech, according to
Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state who attended the
morning and luncheon sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said that the United States would refrain from comment
on Yeltsin's effort to piece together a government from the
battling powers of the lower house of Parliament or Duma, regional
leaders and business interests.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We have assiduously maintained our respect for the sovereignty
of the Russian democratic political system,'' he said. ``We're not
going to pick and choose among Russian individual political
figures, Russia's parties, factions in the current Duma, not least,
to be very honest with you, because I'm not sure it would be
helpful to those we wanted to help for us to create a hierarchy of
whose policies we think most promising.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he added, a return to control by Communist or other
reactionary forces would not be greeted kindly by the United States
and other western nations. ``The president said very clearly today
in his speech at the institute that he hoped and believed that
Russia would keep moving forward and not go back and try policies
that have so clearly and dramatically and disastrously failed in
the past,'' Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's day in Moscow began with a brief arrival ceremony at
Vnukovo II airport, where he was met by Chernomyrdin. Clinton and
Chernomyrdin held preliminary discussions in the president's car on
the way into Moscow, where they talked chiefly about Russia's
current economic challenges, Talbott said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton placed a wreath at the tomb of the unknown soldier along
the Kremlin wall, and then proceeded to a 90-minute private meeting
with Yeltsin in the Russian president's ornate oval-shaped study.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin greeted the American delegation, which included
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright; Bill Richardson, the
secretary of energy; Samuel Berger, the national security adviser;
Gene Sperling, director of the national economic council, and
Lawrence Summers, the deputy secretary of the treasury. Yeltsin
presented his visitors with a replica of an American flag given by
an American delegation to Russia in 1866.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin met privately, then held a working lunch
attended by about a half-dozen senior officials on each side. Apart
from the economic and political crises gripping the country, the
leaders discussed the ethnic bloodshed in Kosovo, Iraqi
noncompliance with international arms monitoring and American
concerns about Russian missile technology sales to Iran, according
to Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the first lady,
visited Elementary School No. 19, on the eastern bank of the Moscow
River, to mark the official opening of Russian schools.
</P>
<P>
   A group of well-scrubbed youngsters warmly applauded the
Clintons and presented them with a doll and a plaque. Igor Dyomin,
7, wearing a sailor suit, performed a version of the high-kicking
Cossack dance, to the delight of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   In brief remarks, Clinton referred to Russia's current troubles
and praised the courage and patience the Russian people have shown
in earlier crises. He encouraged the students to explore the
Internet, work to repair the environment and expand the frontiers
of knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   And he said: ``I know that Russian students love to read and are
proud of your country's great writers. A teacher here in Moscow
asked her first grade class why they thought reading was important.
One girl stood up and answered, `You can read any book. You can
read Pushkin.' No one in the first grade in my country is reading
Pushkin.''
</P>
<P>
   The children laughed.

LEWINSKY ISSUE INSPIRES THEME FOR GOP ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Conn., Nev.)   (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the first indication that the Republican Party
intends to make President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky a central campaign issue, the party introduced Tuesday a
multimillion-dollar advertising drive in which a leading message
will be ethics.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements, mostly on television, will be placed in
selected congressional districts around the country. The theme of
the first of them: ``Honesty does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, which is sponsoring the campaign with the
Republican National Committee, said that while the commercials
would probably not mention Clinton directly, many would focus on
honesty and integrity in government.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to emphasize ethics demonstrates that the stated
intention of House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other top Republicans
to let Clinton's troubles play out for themselves does not reflect
Republican electoral strategy. In fact, Gingrich; House Majority
Leader Dick Armey and other leading Republicans who do not have
particularly threatening opponents this year have each pledged to
donate $500,000 to the effort from their own campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said $20 million had been raised or pledged so far. The
campaign's very ambitious goal: a budget of $37 million.
</P>
<P>
   Linder said that in the last two weeks, since Clinton
acknowledged having had a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, polls in
several congressional districts have shown that issues like crime
and education are being supplanted by ethics as a chief voter
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see that integrity and honesty in government have risen to
the top of the charts in terms of the interest of the public,''
Linder said. ``The polling results are a reflection of what's
happening at the White House. There's no question that the American
people are focused on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for evidence, Linder spokesman Todd Harris provided
findings of private polls for two Republican congressional
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In both of those surveys, respondents were asked to pick from a
list the most important issue this year. But in neither were
integrity and honesty overwhelmingly chosen.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the polls, conducted in a district in the Midwest,
18.7 percent said ``restoring honesty and integrity to government''
was the leading issue. But 17 percent _ a statistically
indistinguishable figure _ cited Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In the second survey, in a district in the Northwest, 20 percent
chose ``bringing honesty and integrity to government and government
officials.'' But the same percentage chose ``improving education.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the Republican argument that ethics had become the
leading issue, Dan Sallick, a spokesman for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, said: ``That's contrived. Both
public and private polling continue to show education, health care
and Social Security are the issues really on people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans plan to make their advertising drive an ``issue
advocacy'' campaign, which can legally ignore federal limits on
contributions as long as it does not specifically advocate the
election or defeat of a particular candidate. But the
advertisements will sound themes clearly intended to help specific
Republican contenders for the House, or hurt their Democratic
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Linder, speaking in a telephone conference call with reporters,
said the advertising campaign was intended to counter the estimated
$35 million in commercials that the AFL-CIO pumped into the 1996
elections on behalf of the Democrats. The labor federation has said
it will spend much less this year.
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the interview, Linder said ethics issues would
be raised only in those districts where they were relevant. But
throughout the conversation, he repeatedly turned to the matter of
honesty and integrity in government.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to disclose where subsequent commercials would
appear, he made public the first one, which is harshly critical of
Shelley Berkley, a Democratic congressional candidate in Las Vegas,
whose campaign has been dogged by ethics accusations. Among other
things, the local press has reported that while working for a
casino executive in 1996, Ms. Berkley wrote him a memorandum
suggesting that Nevada judges would do him favors in exchange for
donations to their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In this commercial, headlines about Ms. Berkley that flash on
the screen are followed by urgings from the announcer: ``Call
Shelley Berkley. Tell her government shouldn't be for sale. Tell
her we're better than that. Tell her honesty does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   As Linder declared that he was ``putting the GOP on the
offensive,'' Democrats were becoming increasingly nervous about
Clinton's troubles. One of them, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of
Connecticut, was seemingly so uneasy Tuesday about facing reporters
who wanted to question him on the issue that he slipped out a side
door of then Capitol after a luncheon with colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Stirring speculation that Lieberman would have strong public
remarks to make about the president's conduct _ some Democrats said
he was even weighing a call for Clinton's censure _ advisers said
the senator might well have something to say but did not want to
speak out until after Clinton's trip to Russia and Ireland.

EDITORIAL: REBOUND ON WALL STREET
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The American stock market bounced back Tuesday, encouraging
investors around the world and reducing the pressure on central
bankers to lower interest rates here and in Europe. Perhaps markets
will now pause to see just how far Asia's economic woes will
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Until this summer, most investors had been willing to act as if
the American economy would continue to hum along, despite growing
problems that have plunged most of Asia into recession. Now many
think it will be difficult for the world's leading economies to
avoid slowing. ``It is only a question of time,'' warned Neal M.
Soss, the chief U.S. economist for Credit Suisse First Boston,
``before even the mighty U.S. economy catches cold.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, the evidence of illness in this country is so far
limited. There are signs that banks are less willing to lend than
they had been, and manufacturers are seeing a slowing of orders.
But American consumers have continued to spend, and overall
economic activity has not fallen off a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   That economic strength was cited by some analysts Tuesday as
evidence that American stocks had fallen too far, and those
arguments helped the market recover. But an irony of the current
situation is that the apparent health of the American economy may
end up hurting the world. That is because the Federal Reserve is
charged by law with focusing on the U.S. economy, with the rest of
the world a secondary priority.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what is happening is that much of the world is being starved
of capital as investors who only recently were all too eager to
invest in emerging markets are now fleeing those markets. Central
banks in those countries have raised interest rates in a futile
attempt to bring capital back, only to see the high rates further
depress the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   As Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist for Hoenig &AMP; Co., said
this week, ``a global central bank would drive interest rates
sharply lower in response to these obvious deflationary forces.''
But there is no such bank. The closest thing available would be
concerted action by the Federal Reserve and the major European
central banks. Calmer markets make that less likely.
</P>
<P>
   One Asian country, Malaysia, took matters into its own hands
Tuesday by announcing stringent capital controls _ hoping to
stabilize the value of Malaysia's currency while allowing local
interest rates to fall and stimulating local business activity.
Such a move, however, will make foreign investment even less
likely, and runs the risk of encouraging corruption since it will
be up to the government to decide which people, or companies, can
move their money out of the country. But it is an understandable
move in the current situation, and only serves to heighten the need
for international action to get the world growing again.

AN ADVOCATE FOR SUBWAY RIDERS GETS A FILM ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
BY ALEX KUCZYNSKI AND DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gene Russianoff, the earnest underdog lawyer for the
Straphangers Campaign (a transportation advocacy group) and the New
York Public Interest Research Group, (a government watchdog
organization), has gone Hollywood. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff abandoned his usual work schedule Tuesday _ ``gearing
up to bash all the candidates for governor for not giving New
Yorkers enough subway and bus service,'' he said _ to tape a scene
with Mark Wahlberg for ``The Yards,'' a Miramax film to be released
next year about corruption in the commuter rail industry. The movie
also stars James Caan, Charlize Theron, Joaquin Phoenix and Faye
Dunaway.
</P>
<P>
   Russianoff, who has never appeared in a movie, arrived on the
set _ a No. 6 train at the Parkchester stop in the northern Bronx _
at 7 a.m. (Because he couldn't bear the thought of taking a car to
get to the set of a movie about trains, he had to wake up at 4
o'clock to catch the subway from his home in Brooklyn.) He was to
play the nonspeaking role of a snoozing subway rider. As Russianoff
plopped into a seat across from Wahlberg _ whom the
not-yet-ready-for-prime-time Russianoff still calls Marky Mark, by
the way _ the assistant director told him to look as if he was
sleeping. They had a brief spat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him no one would sleep on the subway unless you were
semi-comatose,'' he said. ``It's dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   FORMER POLITICIAN FINDS EMPLOYMENT
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ruth W. Messinger, whose long political career has
been so closely associated with the borough of Manhattan, announced
Tuesday that she had accepted a job with larger boundaries:
president and executive director of the American Jewish World
Service, a nonprofit group that provides aid and technical advice
to developing nations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since her loss last fall to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani,
Messinger, a former Manhattan borough president and city council
member, has been unfamiliarly untethered to the political world.
Though she has accepted teaching jobs at Hunter and Queens
colleges, she said her new position is a natural outgrowth of her
life's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wonderful opportunity to work in the field of social
justice, which is what I believe my political and professional
career has been about,'' she said. The 13-year-old group, based in
Manhattan, provides volunteers and assistance to countries in need
of aid in health, economic development, agriculture and education,
as well as disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   MOTHERLY CONCERNS
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With things falling off buildings all around town,
some mothers are worried. One of them is Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   In an affidavit filed in New York State Supreme Court on Monday,
Madonna joined a lawsuit intended to stop the YMCA from building a
41-story residential tower near her apartment building on Central
Park West, The Associated Press reported. The proposed
construction, according to the filing, would create a ``hazard for
me and my child.''
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, who identifies herself in the affidavit as a
professional entertainer and a mother, is one of several Upper West
Side mothers to file affidavits in the case, said Kevan Cleary, a
spokesman for the coalition of West Side groups that filed the
lawsuit on Aug. 16. The defendants include the Y and the Buildings
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit cited the July 21 incident in which scaffolding
gave way on the north side of the 48-story Conde Nast building on
43rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Elise Fink, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, said
the department had been working to ensure the site's safety and had
met with community leaders, contractors and representatives of the
YMCA.

 &HT;    Duval expecting `Bermuda triangle'
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANATA _ On Monday, David Duval spoke on a teleconference from
St. Augustine, Fla., after a victory in the NEC World Series of
Golf gave him six wins since last fall. He wanted to know about
East Lake's bermuda rough, which should be 4-5 inches deep for the
Tour Championship. ``Is it going to be dormant by then, I hope?''
Duval asked. Sorry, the PGA Tour's leading money-winner was told,
barring a rare early frost, it will be alive and presumably nasty.
``Oh, well, that's not good,'' Duval said. ``There's nothing you
can really do to prepare for it.'' During tournament week,
regardless of his incredible run and new status as the No. 2 player
in the world behind Tiger Woods, Duval will be questioned about his
lack of success in Atlanta, his college home. As PGA Tour history
records all too familiarly for Duval, he's had serious shots to win
the BellSouth Classic in 1992 while at Georgia Tech, and as a pro
in 1996 and 1997. ``To win in Atlanta certainly would be special,''
he said. ``I don't think I've ever even won a raffle in Atlanta.''
Still angry about finishing second at the Masters after leading by
three strokes on his Sunday back nine, Duval said, ``If I don't win
a major, I'd rather finish third or fourth, because finishing
second is like getting kicked in the teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones added to Solheim Cup team
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Rosie Jones, added to the Solheim Cup team as a
captain's choice by Judy Rankin, along with Sherri Steinhauer, has
a 4-2-0 record in two 1990 and 1996 appearances, both U.S. wins.
``Rosie is as good a match player as I know,'' Rankin said, ``and I
very much wanted her with us. She has the right kind of chemistry.
She has that knack for match play.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly tries to hang in after ordeal
</P>
<P>
   After that sad scene from the Greater Vancouver Open last week
as John Daly, suffering from shakes and chills, started crying
during the first round, many people are surmising that the former
British Open and BellSouth Classic champion has started drinking
again. However, Daly contends he is still sober and is being backed
by his support group. Daly said, ``I called everybody I know pretty
much and they said, 'You're right where you're supposed to be. We
know you're sober.''' Daly said he has been told that the first two
years of his recovery program are the hardest. ``The shakes will
come and go,'' he said, ``and some are going to last longer than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia quite the seve disciple
</P>
<P>
   His semifinal loss to 44-year-old Tom McKnight at the U.S.
Amateur notwithstanding, Spain's Sergio Garcia is a dynamic talent.
A longer hitter than his guru, Seve Ballesteros, ever hoped to be,
the British Amateur champion also possesses his mentor's splendid
short game. In time, Garcia might even sound like Seve. Garcia has
memorized Ballesteros' victory speech from the British Open and
used to recite it to himself every night at bedtime. The words were
in English, by the way, and at the time Garcia spoke none. . . .
Marietta, Ga.'s Joe Inman gave his rookie Senior PGA Tour season a
huge boost with a tie for third at the Bank of Boston Senior
Classic on Sunday. Inman earned $66,000 _ easily the largest
paycheck of his pro career. His caddie was Tom Losinger, who
teaches at Willi Plett's Sports Park in Woodstock. In a
Georgia-heavy representation, LaGrange's Allen Doyle tied for fifth
and Albany's Bobby Stroble tied for eighth. . . . Columbus native
Hugh Royer tied for fifth at Vancouver on Sunday, banking $65,500.
. . . The Squeeky Medlen Charitable Foundation will be the
beneficiary at the First Annual Pro-Caddie-Amateur Tournament Oct.
26 at Isleworth Country Club in Orlando. Caddies will team up with
their pro bosses to raise money in the name of their former
colleague, who died last year from leukemia.

   Has the stock market hit bottom?
</P>
<P>
   By Jim Bohman DAYTON DAILY NEWS
</P>
<P>
   It seemed possible Tuesday as the Dow Jones industrial average
rebounded 288.36 points or 3.82 percent Tuesday to 7827.43 in a
vigorous rally that offset much of Monday's 512.61 plunge.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the blue chip Dow stocks on the upsurge was the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 Index which climbed 36.96 points to 994.25, a gain of
5.06 percent. The Nasdaq composite jumped 75.84 points to 1575.14,
up 3.86 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts were skeptical and look for more big swings as
investors deal with a shaky global economy whipsawed by troubles in
Asia, Latin America and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has been downward for stocks, and that probably will
continue,'' said Robert Premus, professor of economics at Wright
State University. The stock market correction ``may be close to a
bottom, but there still are some big concerns out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Premus explained that the economic slump in Japan has
deteriorated into a deep recession that could take five years to
resolve. ``This has spread around the world except for Europe and
the United States. That is causing a lot of uncertainty.'' He said
the collapsing Russian economy compounds the uncertainty about
future profits of American companies.
</P>
<P>
   The economist suggested that small investors with IRA and 401(k)
retirement accounts consult a financial advisor for a strategy to
deal with the jumpy market. People who plan to retire soon may want
to move some money out of stocks and into fixed income investments.
But young people with a longer outlook might wait for a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little late for shifting funds, but on the other hand
it's never too late,'' Premus said. ``You missed the best
opportunity to switch a month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Suttman, president of EBS Asset Management, agreed that
world economic problems are far from resolved. Nevertheless, he
said the 16 percent drop in the Dow index since mid-July presents
enticing bargains among badly battered small stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start putting our toe back in the water,''
Suttman said. ``We are going to begin buying some of the smaller
companies that have sustained 40 to 60 percent declines in stock
prices over the last four months.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington Twp. financial planner David A. Kay, operator of The
Advisory Group, agrees that many stocks are cheap at current
levels. ``I would describe the market with two words: buying
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay said he is advising clients to sit tight rather than sell
into a depressed market. ``Nothing that I have seen or read tells
me that this is going to be a long-term trend.'' He said negative
sentiments being voiced are speculation based on uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Kay said he sent a letter to his clients last week cautions them
think long term and get used to large numbers. On a percentage
basis, a 100 point swing in the Dow today is the equivalent of what
used to be about a 25 point change 10 years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kay also told his clients that while it is important to review
your investment portfolio periodically, don't look at your stock or
mutual fund values in the paper every day. If you're interested in
investing in something where daily numbers are important, ``then
throw your money away buying lottery tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Washington Twp. financial planner, Bill Wood of Horizon
Financial Services, said anxious clients are calling to ask if they
need to change their portfolios. Wood said he reviews their
holdings and retirement plans and suggests that they sell stocks
only if they will need the money in the near future. Otherwise, he
urges them to hold on and wait for a market rebound.

IN FIVE YEARS, A NOBODY BECOMES SOMEBODY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1993, only one person in America could possibly have foreseen
the day when Conan O'Brien would be so popular on late-night
television that NBC would hand him an hour of prime time to
celebrate his fifth anniversary on the air:
</P>
<P>
   Conan O'Brien _ in his wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   But if anybody has earned the right to have his wildest dreams
taken seriously it is O'Brien, 35, who will indeed see that once
stupefyingly unlikely event come to pass on Sept. 16, when ``Late
Night With Conan O'Brien'' hits the big time. Right there at 10
p.m., where ``Law and Order'' usually presides, it is going to be
Conan, front and center, the man of the hour, the host, the star.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is the same somewhat awkwardly appealing young
man who pushed himself into the glare of publicity surrounding the
departure of David Letterman from NBC's late-night empire and asked
to be accepted as his successor, despite holding a performing
resume so skimpy that it included appearances in industrial films
hawking musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   That moment, stepping out onto the studio stage as host of
``Late Night'' in September 1993, happened only because of
O'Brien's dreams. That he managed to survive a professional hazing
so withering it might have left the most polished of performers too
shattered to leave their beds was almost completely because of his
determined refusal to abandon those dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Just how deep did the dreams go? Suzanne Daniels, a classmate of
O'Brien's at Harvard University who later married his writing
partner Greg Daniels (ultimately and currently the executive
producer of Fox's animated hit ``King of the Hill''), has a special
insight into what is turning into the Conan O'Brien legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his senior year, The Crimson ran a picture of Conan along
with some different people in the class,'' Ms. Daniels said,
referring to Harvard's daily newspaper. ``Everyone was asked where
they'd be in 10 years. Conan said: `Hosting my own show on
television.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He made it in eight.
</P>
<P>
   Of course he also predicted he would have his own perfume and
line of dolls, but maybe they're coming.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Daniels, who is now the WB network's executive vice
president for programming and who worked with O'Brien when he was a
writer on ``Saturday Night Live,'' and her husband came to share a
running joke about O'Brien's apparently whimsical ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we used to come home and get ready to turn on the
television, one of us would always say, `Turn on Conan, honey.' The
odd thing is, now we say it, and he really (italics)is(end italics)
on television.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret to this self-realization, Ms. Daniels said, is the
same string of talents that made O'Brien stand out at Harvard, and
in the writers' rooms at ``Saturday Night Live'' and ``The
Simpsons'': energy, likability and the originality of his comedy
instincts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien had those three things all along. Those were the
attributes that Lorne Michaels _ the ``Saturday Night Live''
producer whom NBC also put in charge of finding the savior for
``Late Night'' _ talked about when he more or less plucked O'Brien
from the mist and told NBC that this was the new late-night host
they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's reaction at the time, and for a long time after, was,
``What's behind curtain No. 2?''
</P>
<P>
   It may be barely remembered, now that O'Brien is hot enough to
have his birthday party in prime time, but NBC didn't stop looking
for a different option for quite a while. Before O'Brien even got
on the air, NBC executives sniffed seriously around Garry
Shandling. (Had he accepted, the world wouldn't have had the last
five years of brilliance from ``The Larry Sanders Show.'')
</P>
<P>
   Less than six months into O'Brien's tenure, NBC moved Greg
Kinnear onto his ``Later'' flank (at 1:30 a.m.), a threat that
didn't even come with a veil. (And had he edged O'Brien out,
Kinnear wouldn't have been sitting in a tux at the Oscars last
spring as a best supporting actor nominee.)
</P>
<P>
   Still later, when NBC had talks with Jon Stewart, justifiable
paranoia still reigned inside the Conan shop. (And had he settled
at NBC, Comedy Central could hardly have hoped to match the noise
it stirred by naming Stewart the next host of its ``Daily Show.'')
</P>
<P>
   That NBC had long-lingering doubts about O'Brien was no secret
inside the network. Well into O'Brien's first year, one senior NBC
executive stood having coffee and danish at a network event and
openly mocked O'Brien as an amateur, saving special scorn for his
sidekick, Andy Richter, whom the executive dismissed with the
comment ``How is (italics)that(end italics) guy on television?''
</P>
<P>
   None of this escaped O'Brien, who didn't have to be a Harvard
graduate to intuit that he was an endangered host. As his initial
six-month contract was about to expire, O'Brien was told that NBC
was going to renew him, on a month-by-month basis.
</P>
<P>
   This was like moving his host chair directly over a trap door.
The writers worked on 13-week contracts. If they had found out that
O'Brien's deal was shorter than theirs, they would have all been
out looking for work. NBC finally relented and gave O'Brien a
13-week renewal, still all but unheard of for a network television
``star.'' He was asked to stay afloat on this rolling 13-week wave
and, by the way, be funnier.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He did it with what seems now like amazing grace. But it was not
always easy.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, O'Brien started with a honeymoon. Critics gave him a
lot of slack in the special noose they carry around for failing
late-night hosts. His first show was pleasantly reviewed; the
opening taped montage of him heading to work for his first day
(which cleverly ended with O'Brien hanging himself) hinted at the
fresh comedy style to come.
</P>
<P>
   And if he was ragged in monologues and a bit hyper around guests
in those early days, that got little notice _ because his timing
was good. O'Brien went on the air the same time that Chevy Chase
was beginning his own late-night effort on Fox, a disaster so ripe
and pure that it drew all the fire away from O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after Chase went down to cancellation some weeks later,
there was some rejoicing inside O'Brien's shop; he had, after all,
outlasted one late-night host already.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien himself was far less sure. He had a hollow feeling in
the pit of his stomach, sensing that with Chase out of the way he
could hear the sound of the heavy guns swinging in his direction.
</P>
<P>
   He was grimly correct. The critical pounding began, and it
reached high point (which O'Brien now ruefully labels his own low
point) later that fall with an especially thorough trashing in The
Washington Post. That article happened to be published the same day
that O'Brien had scheduled a blast of publicity intended to help
save the show: a satellite radio tour, which consisted of sitting
in a New York studio talking to dozens of radio stations across the
country, one after the other.
</P>
<P>
   Every single one of them had seen the ripping he had taken in
the press that morning; every single one of his interviewers asked
him how he thought he could possibly survive a drubbing like this.
Every single one of them believed they were questioning a condemned
prisoner: dead man talking.
</P>
<P>
   O`Brien screwed up his optimism, assured every questioner he'd
be all right, grinned his way through it all. And then, exhausted
and slump-shouldered, he made his way downtown to his office in
Rockefeller Center, where he went in, closed the door and literally
crawled under his desk.
</P>
<P>
   But he went on the air that night. He did another show and then
another one after that, hanging on because he knew, as he later
described it, that he was not like Chevy, or Dennis Miller, or any
of the many others who had been chewed up and spit out by the
late-night grinder. He knew that if he failed at this, he wasn't
going to make any movies or sitcoms or HBO specials; his career as
a performer was going to be _ poof _ gone.
</P>
<P>
   All he could do to prevent that, of course, was improve his
show, by improving himself. It was a process so gradual that it was
imperceptible day by day. The flashes of comedy brilliance were
always there; to a remarkable degree they were in place from the
beginning, which demonstrated just how effectively O'Brien; his
producer Jeff Ross; his head writer, Robert Smigel, and his
overseer Lorne Michaels had fashioned the show at its inception.
</P>
<P>
   Richter, notwithstanding management disgust, was there all
along, and his natural, wry funniness began seeping through
nightly, as did a genuine sense of affectionate partnership that
few other late-night shows have demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   Max Weinberg, onetime drummer for Bruce Springsteen's E Street
Band, was in place with a sensational band and a surprisingly warm,
gentle personality that made him an ideal foil. Many of the
earliest comedy bits became the show's comedy signature: the
``Clutch Cargo'' moving lips bit, the goofy Year 2000 predictions,
the insane chroma-key desk trips.
</P>
<P>
   All of those bits were on the air, and getting laughs, early.
The rest was up to O'Brien himself. Never a stand-up, he had to
make his monologue section biting where others were polished; he
had to be enthusiastic in his interviews without sounding like a
college cheerleader.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien put those parts into place as if he were a highly
motivated rock enthusiast fine-tuning a car radio to a distant
station, absolutely sure of exactly what he eventually wanted to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been year 3 or 4 when the sound started to get
through; some NBC executives probably heard it later than many
others. By the time the critics started to hear it, the audience
already had. Ratings were up; NBC started counting profits. In
April 1997, O'Brien got a five-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a prime-time special. More than that, he has a comic
identity as distinctive as his name. In the business, stars explain
that they're in New York to ``do Letterman'' or in Los Angeles to
``do Leno.'' But nobody says they're doing O'Brien. They say
they're doing Conan.
</P>
<P>
   Conan O'Brien once proudly responded to a reporter who had asked
him how it felt to get his job as a ``relative unknown'' by saying,
``Sir, I'm a complete unknown.'' Now he's on a first-name basis
with stardom.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TOUGH OPENING GAMES CREATE JITTERY COACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Bobby Bowden learned that right now, this edition of the
Florida State Seminoles would be a 30-point underdog against his
1993 national championship team. And Nebraska's Frank Solich got a
lesson in medicine, after preseason injuries made his secondary
vulnerable and a ligament tear complicated his quarterback
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Tough openers demand immediate answers. To schedule them takes
courage. To lose them can curse a season. Bowden and Solich
survived; now it's time for John Cooper, Lloyd Carr and Joe Paterno
to learn about their teams' championship potential.
</P>
<P>
   For Ohio State's Cooper, transcripts rather than touchdowns may
determine whether the Buckeyes will head into Morgantown on
Saturday favored to stop a West Virginia team that has a powerful
running back in Amos Zereoue. As early as Thursday, all of Ohio
will find out whether the all-America linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer
passed summer courses in AIDS awareness, golf and music and is
eligible to play for a Buckeye team that was No. 1 in the preseason
polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're anxious to play; we need to play,'' said Cooper, who
would like to return the focus to the football field.
</P>
<P>
   His Big Ten rival, Michigan's Carr, will find out whether Tom
Brady, a fourth-year junior, is really the quarterback to defend a
national championship when the Wolverines head into South Bend for
a potentially catastrophic opener with Notre Dame. And Penn State's
Paterno may be two games away from 300 career victories, but he has
a young, banged-up team facing the traditional giant killers
Southern Mississippi, and it could delay his taking his place
alongside such icons as Bear Bryant, Pop Warner and Amos Alonzo
Stagg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it helps you in preseason because your concentration
from the players is very good,'' Carr said of opening at Notre
Dame. ``They understand they are coming out against an outstanding
football team right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wolverines were ranked fifth by both the coaches and news
media polls, but only recently settled on Brady as their starting
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Penn State was the preseason No. 1, but this year the
Nittany Lions are 13th in both polls and take on 23d-ranked
Southern Miss in what might be the most evenly matched game of the
weekend. Penn State may play both Kevin Thompson and Rashard Casey
at quarterback, because Paterno has not decided on a starter;
fullback Aaron Harris is not ready to return from a torn anterior
cruciate ligament sustained last season.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno has acted as if his young team were the underdog and
said that this could be the riskiest game of the season. ``If they
were anybody else but Southern Mississippi, they'd be ranked a lot
higher,'' he said. ``They are not in a big urban area. They haven't
been recognized as they should have been through the years. This is
one of the toughest openers we have had to play.''
</P>
<P>
   At Giants Stadium Monday night, Florida State needed a late
second-half rally to beat Texas A&AMP;M, 23-14, in the Kickoff Classic.
Like West Virginia, Notre Dame and Southern Miss, the Aggies were
ranked in the second half of the top 20 and played well with little
to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gained ground by playing us tough,'' Bowden said. ``If we
had lost, we would have tumbled out of the top 10, and it's tough
to climb back.`
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Florida State began its title run in the Kickoff
Classic by drubbing Kansas, 42-0. With a new quarterback, new
running back and 52 freshmen and sophomores on an 85-man roster,
Bowden said he needed an early test to gauge his club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this team was one of my most talented,'' he said. ``But
now I know they're 30 points away from becoming a true champion.
But now I've identified what needs work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing unusual about the headlines that trumpeted
Nebraska's 56-27 Saturday night rout of a Louisiana Tech team that
went 9-2 last year. But a look at the statistics showed the risks
of tough openers. The Bulldogs' quarterback, Tim Rattay, threw for
590 yards _ 405 of them to wideout Troy Edwards, who broke the
National Collegiate Athletic Association all-division record for
receiving yards.
</P>
<P>
   Solich won in his head coaching debut, but other Big 12 staffs
are now working on their passing. A preseason injury to Clint
Finley forced the Huskers to move rover Mike Brown to free safety.
``Our secondary has been disjointed,'' Solich said.
</P>
<P>
   More harrowing was the ligament tear in the left knee sustained
by the sophomore quarterback Bobby Newcombe. He completed 9 of 10
passes for 168 yards with 1 touchdown, and ran for 2 more. But now
he is day to day while the freshman Eric Crouch takes the
first-team snaps as the Cornhuskers get ready for
Alabama-Birmingham.  &QL;

INTERNET STOCKS HAVE LED MARKET DECLINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK P. COUCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, Internet stocks have been the hottest sector of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   For months, Internet companies have been among the
least-profitable sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's no surprise that Internet stocks have been among
the leaders as the market tumbled in recent days. As the market
recovered Tuesday, some of the stocks regained ground. But they
still have a long way to climb to get back to where they were
earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if investors started reading the Doonesbury comic strip
last week when it began spoofing the economics of the Internet
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Doonesbury characters work for a company that spends other
people's money, that measures its success by how much money it
loses, and that pays its employees in stock options that are worth
as much as lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's absolutely dead on,'' said David Simons, research analyst
for Digital Video Investments in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The companies doing business on the Internet have stock prices
that can't be justified by their current profits because they don't
have profits, Simons said. Investors are hoping to catch the next
rising star. So stock prices are often based on the buzz generated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a presumption that once you've got brand recognition,
it's yours forever,'' Simons said. ``That's obviously not true.
Coca-Cola doesn't spend umpteen million dollars on advertising for
its corporate ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if mere exposure guarantees success, which isn't
true,'' Simons said. ``We're not talking high finance here. We're
talking Economics 101.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for investors is that they don't have good tools to
measure how successful an online company is or will be.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the online book retailer, cites the number of people
who visit its Web pages as a measure of its success. But Simons
said that isn't a reliable measure of how many people are buying
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how Wall Street would react if Federated Department
Stores started reporting the number of window shoppers,'' Simons
said.
</P>
<P>
   The shifting sands for measuring Internet-related companies
creates confusion and helps prop up stock prices. Simons said
Internet companies like to keep their stock prices high because
they use stock to pay workers and to buy other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have jumped on the Internet bandwagon without
knowing the destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are three- to five-year plays for these companies to
start making any money,'' said Tom Ronk, an analyst for Market
Stratagems in Newport Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That long-term outlook is too far out for some investors, the
market discovered this week.
</P>
<P>
   America Online, the largest Internet service provider in the
country, has fallen from its height of $140 a share to $85.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the bookseller, lost nearly half its value as its
stock tumbled to $79.95 in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Broadcast.com, which offers radio and televison
content via the Internet, jumped on the stock-market roller coaster
in July, jumping from its initial price of $18 up to $74. It
settled at $35.25 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, a popular gateway to the Internet, fell to $72.25 Tuesday
from a high of $103.75 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even companies that depend on the Internet for direct sales were
dragged down. Dell Computer, which is based in Round Rock, Texas,
oustide Austin has reported stellar sales in a sluggish market for
other computer makers. But its stock plunged $18 a share Monday.
Tuesday, Dell recovered $8.38 a share.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jonas Bjorkman had just finished his first-round
victory in over Cedric Pioline in five sets Tuesday, but as
Bjorkman remained standing to avoid cramping inside the men's
locker room, his workday was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   What lay ahead for the Swedish star was a short jog, stretching,
rehydration, massage and treatment on the left thigh that began
troubling him in the latter stages against Pioline. In all, the
process would take as long as Bjorkman's 2-hour-59-minute victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the players would drink some fluids after a
match and then head back to the hotel, but that's not the way it is
anymore,'' said Bob Russo, the senior trainer for the U.S. Tennis
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Success at the highest level of men's tennis is not simply a
question of how well you serve, pound ground strokes or handle
pressure. It is also a question of how well you recover, and in
Grand Slam events, where men's matches are three of five sets, a
player's powers of recuperation are even more essential.
</P>
<P>
   Just as racquet technology has evolved dramatically in the last
two decades, so has the science of therapy and the therapeutic
means that players have available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Some pros, like Todd Martin, now travel with portable electric
stimulation machines that help speed muscle recovery. There is also
widespread use of nutritional supplements (including creatine) and
protein drinks after matches to replenish lost or damaged amino
acids and help the body rebuild muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years ago and before that, players would just be gutting
it out with water and bread and bananas,'' said George Fareed, a
southern California doctr who works with the U.S. Davis Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1993, there were no full-time massage therapists for the
men at the U.S. Open. This year, there are 24, and at least six
times that many clients, which makes for a bustling training room
in the early rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovery is a huge factor now,'' said Todd Snyder, who has
been Pete Sampras' personal trainer for the last four years.
``There are a lot of things you can't control in tennis: the
quality of the opponent, the let cords on important points. But the
one thing you can control is your body, and you have to look out
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was looking out for Sampras at Flushing Meadows in 1996
when he staggered his way through a five-set test of endurance and
character against Alex Corretja in the quarterfinals and then
staggered into the training room cramping and dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving fluids intravenously _ an extreme and relatively
rare remedy for dehydration on tour _ and working with Snyder late
into the evening, Sampras was able to recover quickly enough to win
his final two matches and fourth Open singles title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the areas where guys have really improved is
that they realize their preparation for a match starts as soon as
the last match is over. There is not a lot of celebration time,''
said Doug Spreen, an athletic trainer with the ATP.
</P>
<P>
   The search for an edge has become increasingly frenetic on tour,
with its increasing talent pool and monetary rewards. Fareed said
he is aware that some players have been taking large doses of
creatine, a legal, over-the-counter supplement that helps build
muscle mass and energy reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be used cautiously in tennis,'' Fareed said. ``I
recommend no more than five grams a day, but I suspect some players
have been using 30 to 50 grams.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of anti-inflammatories is also widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen overuse and I worry about that,'' Fareed said.
``I've seen some players develop gastritis and others esophagitis
and they are hampered by that. You can develop bleeding in the
intestinal system and be more susceptible to infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players are now opting for herbal anti-inflammatories,
which are injectable and do not have some of the unpleasant side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Sampras walks off court at a Grand Slam event, Snyder
hands him a drink containing the sorts of electrolyte minerals that
players lose in abundance. Snyder will then help Sampras stretch
for about 15 minutes. Stretching alone is not as useful, according
to Snyder, because it is more difficult to isolate muscles (when
you grab your own toes to stretch a hamstring, you are also using
abdominal muscles to execute the movement).
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after that, Snyder will give Sampras a short
30-minute massage. If Sampras has aches or pains that require
treatment, ice will be applied before the massage. He will begin
eating and continue drinking during the massage.
</P>
<P>
   Only after Sampras has finished his massage does he meet the
news media. When Sampras has finished fielding questions, he and
Snyder head for the nearest restaurant to eat a full
carbohydrate-rich meal. Pasta and pancakes are Sampras staples, and
if Sampras has played a night match at Flushing Meadows, this meal
may be eaten well after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras is still not finished. When he returns to his hotel
after dinner, Snyder gives him a second massage, and this one will
last about 90 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not uncommon to finish up at 2 or 2:30 in the morning,''
Snyder said.

BURTON ACCUSES CLINTON SUPPORTERS OF BEING BEHIND `SCANDAL STORY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dan Burton, whose committee has been
investigating fund-raising abuses in the re-election campaign of
President Clinton, said this week that a national magazine plans to
publish a ``scandal story'' about him at the behest of Clinton's
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At town hall meetings in Indianapolis on Monday, the Indiana
Republican accused Clinton's supporters of spreading rumors about
his personal life in an effort to intimidate him. Burton, the
bombastic chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and
Oversight, warned voters that they should not be surprised to read
that he has had troubles in his 38-year marriage, said a published
account by the Indianapolis Star/News.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the magazine, Vanity Fair, and officials at
the White House and the Democratic National Committee scoffed at
Burton's accusations, calling them unfounded and saying that no
campaign exists to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   While the magazine has been working on an article on Burton, it
has no link to the White House, said the spokeswoman for Vanity
Fair, Beth Kseniak. ``It's totally ridiculous to think that the
White House has anything to do with this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, where the talk is of impeachment hearings and
Monica Lewinsky, some believe Burton's assertions offer a hint of
foreshadowing, or perhaps foreboding. Reports have persisted that
personal peccadillos once considered nobody's business could soon
become everyone's business as members of Congress try to impugn or
defend Clinton's behavior in an expected House impeachment inquiry.
Minor transgressions, adulterous episodes, past tribulations could
all surface, or resurface, along with the specter of impeachment,
say aides, representatives and Congressional observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,'' said
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on Burton's
committee. ``I don't know how people will react about what they
know about themselves. I think that most members of Congress should
understand that the public is pretty outraged when they find
politicians who are hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., who sits on the Judiciary Committee,
the panel with jurisdiction over an impeachment inquiry, said that
any effort at a smear campaign could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time, be it Republicans or Democrats, when you stoop into
the gutter to do that sort of thing, that is not good strategy,
that would turn people off,'' Coble said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Burton's accusation was the second time in a week that a public
official has accused Clinton's supporters of orchestrating a smear
campaign. Last week, Rep. Paul McHale, D-Penn., who called for
Clinton's resignation two weeks ago, was subject to false charges
about his military decorations.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation against McHale surfaced on the NBC program
``Geraldo Rivera'' on Thursday when Rivera, who has been a
persistent defender of Clinton, said he had received a call from
someone ``close to President Clinton'' with information that McHale
may have lied about his military honors. The charge was false, and
a White House official called McHale to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, McHale said that he is
disturbed by the tactics that Clinton's supporters have used
against their enemies, a spillover, he said, from the 1992
presidential campaign's take-no-prisoners approach. ``Someone close
to the president leaked false information to Geraldo about me,''
said McHale. ``That has been a consistent and unfortunate theme
with this president, the use of anonymous leaks to damage, if not
shatter, another person's personal reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton has had a considerably rockier relationship with the
White House than McHale has had, at one point referring to Clinton
with a vulgarity. On Monday, Burton told his constituents that a
reporter for the magazine had been rooting around in his past,
interviewing as many as 200 friends, relatives and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Burton declined to answer specific questions about his marriage,
said news accounts in Indiana, but he volunteered: ``It's not
illegal, anything I've done. But my wife and I _ and I hate to tell
you this _ but my wife and I were separated three times in our
38-year marriage.'' Burton said that one point the two nearly
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I want to tell you: If something comes out, that you read
about, that you think Danny shouldn't have done, I will own up to
it. I won't lie about it. I will tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was not available for comment Tuesday. But his staff
director, Kevin Binger, said the White House has been conducting a
``scorched earth'' campaign against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Burton's accusations that the White House was behind the
Vanity Fair article, Waxman said: ``If he has proof, he ought to
come forward with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to the
President, said Tuesday that while the White House has taken issue
with Burton's Congressional investigation, it has never criticized
Burton personally. ``We never have and never will talk about or
criticize him on personal matters,'' Emanuel said. ``Everybody's
personal life is exactly that _ private, personal and nobody's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   As House members prepare to return to Capitol Hill next week,
one House Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said the Judiciary Committee had already received inquiring calls
about the personal lives of certain members.

JACOBS BACKS AWAY FROM DEAL FOR BROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Thomas Murdough Jr. is cq; s and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jeremy Jacobs, owner of the Boston Bruins, will not be
the owner of the new Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Officially ending his pursuit of what will likely be the most
expensive franchise in sports, Jacobs cited ``personal reasons'' in
a letter delivered to the National Football League Tuesday,
according to his spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has a clear rule that no owner of a sports franchise in
the same market as an NFL team may own another NFL team, but
sources close to Jacobs had said that he entered the competition to
own the Browns hoping that something could be worked out to skirt
that.
</P>
<P>
   He has insisted publicly that he would never sell the Bruins,
and Jacobs's withdrawal from the Browns sweepstakes puts that issue
to rest for now.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs closed down his effort on the same day that two other
candidates pulled out of the high-priced process rather than
submitting proposals during a second round of bidding Tuesday.
Richard Jacobs, owner of the Cleveland Indians, who is no relation
to Jeremy Jacobs, and Thomas Murdough Jr., founder and president of
a large Ohio toy manufacturing company, also withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Murdough said additional information, including financial data,
that was made available to prospective owners persuaded him to
withdraw, despite a desperate attempt to form an alliance with
Richard Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL official said the withdrawals were no surprise, and that
the process is largely unaffected by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they realized that the price was only going to go
higher, and they just decided it was too steep,'' the official
said. ``As for Jeremy, I don't know if it was so much the price as
the cross-ownership issue with the Bruins, and what would become of
that if he continued on in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The second round of bids was due by noon Tuesday. Jacobs moved
to pull the plug on his efforts in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were still doing a lot of due diligence work around here,
right up until recently,'' said Brenda Fullmer, a spokeswoman for
Jacobs's Delaware North Companies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs would have made his decision to withdraw known earlier,
Fullmer said, ``but he did not want to do anything to jeopardize
the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the cross-ownership issue had influenced the
decision, Fullmer said, ``I don't know what the legal
interpretation of that issue would have been, but he has said in no
uncertain terms that he would not sell the Bruins.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Jacobs had said that his intention in
contending for the Browns was to reach an accommodation that would
have allowed him, or members of his family, to own both teams.
Jacobs has two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers, who know Jacobs well, speculated that in
addition to being truly interested in owning the Browns, he entered
the process to establish closer relations in the community of NFL
owners to help further Delaware North's role as a dominant sports
concessionaire, and perhaps as a prelude to take a run at owning
the Buffalo Bills. Delaware North is located in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Browns are clearly a handsome catch, with a new
stadium already under construction in a partnership between public
and private financiers and a solid fan base that clearly has not
diminished since the Browns moved to Baltimore and became the
Ravens. Observers say the franchise will garner at least $500
million, and some estimate the eventual price tag may be
substantially more.
</P>
<P>
   Those still bidding to own the Browns are:
</P>
<P>
   _Alfred Lerner, a banker and suburban Cleveland resident, who
has been joined in his bid by Carmen Policy, the former president
of the San Francisco 49ers;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _Howard Milstein, a New York businessman who has earned a
fortune in banking and real estate, and whose proposed ownership
group includes former Browns players Paul Warfield and Calvin Hill;
</P>
<P>
   _Bart Wolstein, a Cleveland real estate developer, who is
supported by former Browns great Jim Brown;
</P>
<P>
   _Lawrence Dolan, a Cleveland lawyer, and his brother, Charles
Dolan, founder of New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp., one of
the largest cable providers in the country. The Dolan group
includes former Dolphins head coach Don Shula and comedian Bill
Cosby as limited investors.

COWBOYS REWORK AIKMAN CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
and KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Cowboys announced yesterday they have
reworked the contract of quarterback Troy Aikman to free up room
under the NFL salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, who has had his contract adjusted several times since
signing an eight-year, $50 million deal in 1993, was scheduled to
count $7.57 million against the salary cap in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys vice president Stephen Jones wouldn't release detailed
numbers about the adjustment, but said ``it allowed us to do what
we needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy has always done anything he could to help the team,''
Jones said. ``It's not an extension, and he's not going to get less
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the team was bumping right up against the $52 million
salary cap. He said the money was necessary to accommodate a
payroll that includes a 53-man roster, three players on injured
reserve, a practice squad and several former players who continue
to count against the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Among those former players are Charles Haley, Tony Tolbert, Ray
Donaldson and Anthony Miller. Easy come, easy go The Cowboys'
search for a third quarterback has seemingly come back to rookie
free agent Daniel Gonzalez _ that is if the Cowboys can find him.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's turn of events first had the team announcing they
had signed former Stephen F. Austin State star James Ritchey. Then
they rescinded the contract when he failed a physical. Finally, the
Cowboys tried to call Gonzalez, who was cut by the team Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchey, a third-year pro, was the Oilers' third quarterback the
past two seasons, but was released Sunday. Considering his
experience, which also included a stint with NFL Europe, Ritchey
seemed to be ideal for the Cowboys' No. 3 job. However, Ritchey
arrived at the team's headquarters with a bum thumb. Jones said the
injury, and a variety of other medical concerns, made the Cowboys
change their mind.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the team needs a third quarterback for Sunday's
season opener and intends to sign Gonzalez. However, late yesterday
the Cowboys' plans were put on hold when they could not reach
Gonzalez, who had left the Fort Worth-Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   Jones indicated any move for a third quarterback this week
should be considered temporary since the team intends to remain
``fluid'' at the position. Running-back shuffle Despite the solid
preseason play of rookie Tarik Smith, running back Sherman Williams
is expected to get most of the action as Emmitt Smith's backup,
Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris Warren returns next month from a groin injury, the
Cowboys will have four tailbacks and likely will cut one. And
depending on how Williams plays, Tarik Smith could be the odd man
out. Williams was reluctant about playing on special teams during
his first stint with the Cowboys, but Jones said Williams is
willing to play on special teams to stay on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``If \RWilliams\S gets in there with the right attitude and
performs on special teams, he could have new life,'' owner Jerry
Jones said. Running backs coach Clarence Shelmon ``always thought
that Sherman was a good back. What hurt him is when we brought in
Warren. We know Sherman has fumbled in some key situations. He's
got to get stronger to hold onto the ball. We will weigh what to do
about our situation there a month down the road.'' Briefly The
Cowboys signed former Texas Tech quarterback Zebbie Lethridge, who
has converted to cornerback, to the practice squad yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys waived offensive lineman Steve Scifres.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Jones said the Cowboys' game with the Cardinals is a
sellout.

 Experts say high price/earnings could hinder sustained rebound   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Maybe it was just a dead-cat bounce.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That's the colorful, tasteless term Wall Streeters use to
describe a brief rally that often occurs after a huge sell-off in
the market. The theory is that even a dead cat will bounce a bit
after falling from a great height. But it's still dead.
</P>
<P>
   Some market analysts are warning that yesterday's record-volume
stock rally _ in which the Dow Jones industrial average gained back
288 of the 513 points it shed on Monday _ may not be sustainable.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Turner, president of Pring Turner Capital Corp. in San
Ramon, points out that the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index still is
selling at 25 times earnings for the 12 months ended March 31, the
latest period for which figures are available.
</P>
<P>
   P/E ratios are the most commonly used tool to compare the values
of individual stocks to each other or to the market as a whole.
They can also be used to compare the value of the overall market
over time.
</P>
<P>
   The market's current P/E is high by historical standards. In the
three decades ended last year, the S&AMP;P 500 closed the year at more
than 20 times earnings only four times.
</P>
<P>
   More typically, the P/E has ranged from the the mid- to high
teens. In some years, it has fallen to single digits.

<P>
   ``The overvaluation has been so extreme lately that it's going
to take more than a one-month drop to bring things back to
normal,'' Turner contends. He thinks the Dow could drop to the low
6,000s from yesterday's close of 7,827.43.
</P>
<P>
   When comparing P/Es from different eras, however, it's important
to look at the economic backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   High P/E's often coincide with exceptionally low interest rates
_ such as those prevailing now. That's because unacceptably low
yields from fixed-income investments, such as bonds, drive
investors into stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Shurgin, vice president and general manager of index
services for S&AMP;P, also points out that the relatively modest P/Es
of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s came against a background of ``Cold
War and the arms race and high inflation and any number of other
bad things that we don't have now.''
</P>
<P>
   But he concedes that stocks ``were not cheap'' in mid-July, when
the S&AMP;P 500 climbed to more than 30 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Turner points out that high price-earnings ratios normally
indicate that companies are expected to enjoy substantial future
earnings gains. But many analysts have suggested that U.S.
corporate earnings will grow by only about 3 percent next year,
compared to more than 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we catch an even worse case of the Asian flu than we have
up till now, there's a good likelihood that earnings next year will
be down,'' Turner warns.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Goldman, technical analyst with A.G. Edwards &AMP; Son in St.
Louis, says he expects the market to rally late this year and into
next year, approaching and perhaps surpassing the Dow's all-time
record of 9,337.97 set on July 17, as it becomes clear that ``our
economy remains strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, he figures, there could be more big
trouble: ``I don't see evidence yet that we have hit bottom.'' He
predicts that stocks could trade as low as 7,000 on the Dow and no
higher than 8,100 over the next two to four weeks, mainly because
many investors remain terrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy is going to stay strong,'' Goldman says, ``but the
market, being made up of human beings, usually goes to extremes of
both greed and fear.''
</P>
<P>
   Although dead-cat bounces are common after big market plunges _
as bargain hunters scoop up stocks at a fraction of their previous
prices _ sometimes dead cats spring back to life.
</P>
<P>
   On October 19, 1987, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508
points. The next day, the Dow gained more than 100 points. The low
set on October 19 was never touched again.
</P>
<P>
   On October 27, 1997, the Dow fell 554 points, then gained more
than 300 the next day. Despite Monday's 512-point loss, the Dow
still hasn't retreated to its October 27, 1997, low.
</P>
<P>
   It may be years before we know whether yesterday's 288-point
rally was a dead-cat bounce or the beginning of another bull run.

NUMBERS DIDN'T ADD UP FOR JACOBS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Jerry Jacobs, the bottom line has always been that if a deal
doesn't make any cents, it doesn't make any sense. With that in
mind, Jacobs, owner of the Boston Bruins and the FleetCenter, gave
up his bid to become the owner of the Cleveland Browns Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pulled out of it,'' said Jacobs, who was in Boston on Bruins
business. ``The more I looked at it, I realized that I was not
going to be the highest bidder. I had a number in my mind that I
thought would make sense. But the longer this process took, the
more I realized that my number wasn't good enough, and the ones
higher than that just didn't make sense to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew my ownership of the Bruins was a negative from the
(NFL) standpoint, but I think we could have worked around that, if
it turned out that I was the highest bidder. But it never got to
that. Our group worked very hard on this, and did all the due
diligence that we possibly could, and I made the decision not to go
on. I would have loved the opportunity to own the Cleveland Browns,
and someday I would still love to own a team in the NFL. This just
wasn't right for me.''
</P>
<P>
   There were seven acknowledged bidders for the expansion
franchise, which is due to be sold next Tuesday at a special
meeting in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Three bidders _ Jeremy Jacobs, Richard Jacobs (no relation),
owner of the Cleveland Indians, and Thomas Murdough, a Cleveland
businessman, dropped out Tuesday, just before the second stage of
the bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us put in a first (preliminary) bid,'' said Jerry
Jacobs, ``but this one was going to take it to another level.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdough said that he thought the top bid would exceed $500
million, making it the most expensive team in the history of
American sports. Jerry Jacobs thought the bid would be high, but in
the area of $500 million or less.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, the top two bidders from Tuesday will have their
names placed before all 30 NFL owners in Chicago. After some
discussion, the owners will take a vote, and if one bidder receives
23 votes, he will be approved. If not, two things could happen,
according to two owners. Tuesday
</P>
<P>
   One said Tuesday that with the world financial markets in such
upheaval _ and almost all of the bidders having international
investments _ the vote could be delayed until the world economy
stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
   A second owner said that if the money was not what some owners
thought it should be, then they might try to buy the team
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Owners Al Davis of Oakland, Jerry Jones of Dallas, and Malcolm
Glazer of Tampa Bay have said that the Browns would sell for close
to $1 billion. Other owners in the league think that is
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Broncos owner Pat Bowlen thinks it is time to put last season's
Super Bowl triumph behind them. ``This is a new season, and I think
our team is every bit as good as it was a year ago,'' said Bowlen,
whose team hosts the Patriots in Monday night's opener.Tuesday ``We
are not going to have any pregame ceremonies about the Super Bowl.
I wouldn't like it if I were with the Patriots and we had to listen
to all of that stuff before the game. There are some areas we are
better than a year ago, and others where we will be weaker. I'm
still concerned about our offensive line, because Gary Zimmerman
retired and he was a great player. John Elway is excited about
playing. I know John well. This is going to be his last year, and
he is looking forward to it.'' Linebacker Bill Romanowski thinks
the Bronco defensive unit will be just as good as, and perhaps
better than, it was a year ago. ``I like the way we look,'' said
TuesdayRomanowski. ``We've got a (second-round) draft choice, Eric
Brown, at safety and this kid is a hitter. He is going to be a very
good player in this league. A year ago our top pick was (defensive
lineman) Trevor Pryce, and he started out slow and finished strong.
He has picked up from where he was at the end of the year, and now
he has taken his game to the next level. We just picked up (Seth)
Joyner, and he will give us some depth and experience at
linebacker. I feel good about this team. From what I've seen (on
video) of the New England offense, they look a lot like what Dallas
did. Very basic. A lot of timing stuff. The key for us as a defense
is to get after Drew Bledsoe. If we can do it without blitzing,
then it will make it easier for us as a group. We are hoping our
defensive line can get enough heat on him so the rest of us can
just pass-defend. I haven't seen enough of their running backs to
judge how really good they are.''

STANLEY: CHANCES BETTER THAT VAUGHN WILL REMAIN WITH RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Mike Stanley returned to the Red Sox a month ago,
he saw little reason to believe that Mo Vaughn would remain with
the team after this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he'd be back,'' Stanley said Tuesday, ``from
what I heard and from talking with Mo.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stanley, the veteran who has shared first base with Vaughn
and values Vaughn as a friend and fellow student of hitting, now
believes the pendulum has swung the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now chances that he'll stay are an awful lot better,'' Stanley
said. ``For whatever reason _ and I don't know anything about it
and it's not my business _ but he certainly is more open to the
idea of coming back here and playing, being one of those lifers for
an organization, which he should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since I've been here, I didn't sense much urgency for Mo
to leave. But right now, if the season ended today, I think they'd
be talking tomorrow, and Mo would be back in a Red Sox uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley has noticed a significant difference in relations
between Vaughn and general manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see that when they interact on the field or in the clubhouse
is much different than when times were tense,'' Stanley said. ``It
seems very pleasant right now.''
</P>
<P>
   During a turn as guest commentator on NESN's telecast of Monday
night's game, Duquette heaped as much praise on the first baseman
as he has all season. He lauded Vaughn for not allowing his
contract situation to affect his performance.
</P>
<P>
   On the air, Duquette said, ``Randy Johnson had trouble with it.
I thought Mike Piazza had trouble with it in LA. But Mo Vaughn's
been a good teammate here. He's been able to put up good numbers
and he's been able to keep his focus on the field and on the Red
Sox team particularly here over the last month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves a lot of credit for that. You see the numbers
there. He's hit particularly well with men on base during the month
of August. That's crunch time and that's when you want your RBI men
to come through, and Mo Vaughn's been coming through.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought his relationship with Vaughn was better,
Duquette said, ``Things are going well for the team. They seem to
be moving along in the right direction. Will he be with us next
year? I hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn brushed off questions about Duquette's on-air comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said good things about me, that's good,'' he said before
walking off, muttering.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran pitcher Jim Corsi said Duquette should be saying good
things about Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it all,'' Corsi said. ``It's the truth. He knows
what's going on here. Saying the contract hasn't bothered him is
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette has been much maligned both by Vaughn and former Sox
pitcher Roger Clemens, who now has indicated directly and through
his agent, Alan Hendricks, that he would not rule out a return to
Boston. Clemens has the right to ask his current team, the Toronto
Blue Jays, to trade him if they decide they need time to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, who had dinner with Hendricks and Sox CEO John
Harrington here Monday night, pooh-poohed the Clemens matter. He
claimed he and Harrington dined with Hendricks because he
represented Sox pitcher Greg Swindell, who is eligible to be a free
agent after the season. And he refused to give a direct answer to
questions about whether he was surprised that Clemens, after such
harsh criticism of the Sox GM, now would be willing to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any speculation that Clemens is coming to Boston is pure, pure
spec-u-la-tion,'' Duquette said, exaggerating each syllable. ``The
great thing is the Red Sox have their own Cy Young candidate in
Pedro Martinez. He goes out there every day in a Red Sox uniform.
There's no need to speculate that the Red Sox are interested in
acquiring a No. 1 pitcher because the Red Sox already have one.''
</P>
<P>
   That response, however, ignores the fact that the Red Sox
inquired about Clemens's availability before the trading deadline.
When that was pointed out to Duquette, he said, ``The focus should
be on the guys on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked a final time about Clemens's willingness to come back,
Duquette said, ``Interesting, very interesting. But that's just
speculation. He's not going to be traded between now and the end of
the season. There will be other days to talk about that. Not
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley, who was with Clemens in Toronto, said the subject of
returning to Boston never came up while he was with the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   ``If winning is truly his first desire _ and once things closed
here, that was his desire to go to Toronto; he thought they would
win,'' said Stanley. ``But now I think this place is appealing to
him again. Time heals wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is on his way to the Hall of Fame, probably wearing a
Boston hat. Why not go and end his career here?''

MARKET RALLIES AMID BARGAIN HUNTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being pummeled by more than 500 points on Monday, the US
stock market threw off the blues Tuesday and staged a 288-point
rally.
</P>
<P>
   A record 1.21 billion shares changed hands on the New York Stock
Exchange as individuals and institutional investors alike snapped
up newfound bargains among a wide selection of stocks that had been
hammered in Monday's 513-point slide.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's 288.36-point rise in the Dow Jones industrial average,
to 7827.43, was the second-biggest point rise in its 101-year
history, though the 3.8 percent rise did not make the top 10 in
percentage terms.
</P>
<P>
   At the market's closing Tuesday, the Dow was still down about 1
percent since Jan. 1 and down 16 percent from its July 17 high of
9337.97. The Dow Tuesday recouped nearly a third of the losses
sustained by investors in four previous days of market declines.
</P>
<P>
   TuesdayMonday's dive had been triggered in large part by
economic crises in emerging countries and had Wall Street talking
about a possible long-term bear market following an eight-year
boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market had overreacted,'' said Lawrence Horwitz, managing
director of Primark Decision Economics in Boston. &UR;  &LR; ``The US economy
is in great shape. Definitely a slowdown is in the making but
fundamentals are still good, and the direct economic ties with the
countries in the worst shape are not that strong.''
</P>
<P>
   In a volatile day of trading Tuesday, Wall Street was buoyed by
the combination of resilience in Japanese stocks _ the Nikkei index
rose 1.9 percent _ and by growing optimism that a cut in US
interest rates is increasingly likely. President Clinton also
reassured the investment community Tuesday during his visit to
Moscow that the US economy remains strong.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the United States remains ``determined to
stay on a path of fiscal discipline that brought us to where we
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Broader indexes also recovered Tuesday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 rose 36.96 to close at 994.24, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq
index that had recorded its biggest point drop ever on Monday rose
by a record 75.84 Tuesday to close at 1575.09.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange smashed
the record posted Oct. 28, 1997, when the market rose after a
554-point slide.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's rebound, analysts are divided on whether a
true recovery is materializing. Some predict the market has not hit
bottom yet and will continue to be volatile _ as it has over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   There continued to be bad economic news to unsettle investors.
</P>
<P>
   Major US banks _ Citicorp, Bankers Trust Corp., Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter &AMP; Co., and Barclays PLC _ continued reporting that
plunging Russian markets saddled them with losses in trading and
other lines of business. Citicorp, the second-largest US bank,
Tuesday said losses related to Russia will cut its third-quarter
earnings by $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial sector is in much worse shape than people
think,'' said Edgar Peters, chief investment strategist at PanAgora
Asset Management Inc. in Boston, who oversees $17 billion. ``We
don't really know the extent of the damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Overseas troubles have triggered cascading stock and currency
market crises that accelerated over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, the world's second-biggest economy, has failed to address
a financial disaster in its banking system. Russia's financial
system has virtually disintegrated.
</P>
<P>
   European markets dipped Tuesday in a delayed reaction to the
late-Monday slide in the United States. London's FT-SE 100 fell 1.5
percent, while the 40-stock Paris index fell less than 1 percent.
The DAX index in Frankfurt actually rose just under a percent.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said a US slowdown is certain and recession possible,
though unlikely. The Conference Board, a private research group,
Tuesday reported that leading indicators, a gauge of future
economic activity, rose 0.4 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, there is a growing sentiment, economists
said, that the Federal Reserve Board may be willing to reduce US
rates in an attempt to help calm currency and stock markets around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   That was ``definitely the mood'' at a Fed conference last
weekend in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Primark's Horwitz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're virtually certain the Fed is in a neutral stance rather
than a tightening stance. If that is true they could easily moving
to an easing stance over the next month or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the market opened with a big upswing, followed quickly
by a sharp drop. It then proceeded to march steadily higher the
rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strongest names of the strongest companies with the
strongest fundamentals popped back early in the day,'' said Scott
Pape, a portfolio manager for Loomis Sayles LP in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Technology stocks, which had been pronounced casualties on
Monday, were standout gainers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dell Computer Corp., which fell 18 3/4 points Monday, restored 8
3/8 points to end at 108 3/8. Microsoft Corp. regained 5 5/16 to
close at 101 1/4, while Intel Corp. recovered 4 13/16 to close at
76. Yahoo &UR;  &LR; Inc., an Internet stock popular with individual
investors, climbed 3 1/4 to close at 72 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Even pharmaceuticals companies, which are generally enjoying a
golden age, were knocked back on Monday. But they rebounded
sharply &UR;  &LR; Tuesday: Merck &AMP; Co. was up 6 9/16, closing at 122 1/2,
while Pfizer Inc. rose 3 3/4, closing at 96 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to mutual fund and other portfolio managers seeking
bargains, investors who make computer-generated trades were heavy
buyers, said Jeffrey Davis, chief investment strategist for State
Street Global Advisors, which manages $450 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big wave of major institutions who moved in this
morning as early as they could'' on behalf of pension funds and
other billion-dollar clients, Davis said. ``With electronic trading
they can move fast. Timing was everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A rebound was exactly what individual investors hoped for _ and
acted on.
</P>
<P>
   Smith Barney brokers who met at a conference reported that many
of the calls they received were from investors seeking reassurance
about staying in the market, despite Monday's drop, said Richard
Marston, professor of finance at The Wharton School, who attended
the conference in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not getting the calls to sell out. The retail
investors are very patient so far,'' Marston said.

<P>
   SIERRA BLANCA, Texas _ Lupe Bustamante cradled a gallon of milk
under her arm in the dim and sparsely stocked Guerra General Store
on the main street of this dusty outpost, population 600, and
wondered why the whole world seems to want to dump on her tiny
town.
</P>
<P>
   First, New York City completed a deal to ship its treated sewage
to a ranch outside Sierra Blanca, where the sewage has been spread
on the ground since 1992. Then, a New Jersey company announced this
summer that it hoped to ship New York sludge to a ranch in the
nearby town of Allamoore. And now, the state of Texas believes it
is coming to the end of a decade-long effort to enter into a
compact with Vermont and Maine to store their low-level nuclear
waste, along with its own, at a site just outside Sierra Blanca.
The waste would be sealed in concrete and buried beneath the rocky
desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe they choose us because we are a small town,
because we are so distant from everyone and because we have no
political power,'' Ms. Bustamante said. ``I think maybe they are
taking advantage of us. I believe that most of the people are
opposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many environmentalists and residents said that the town was
picked only because it is poor and Hispanic. About two-thirds of
Sierra Blanca's residents are Hispanic, and the per capita income
is $8,000, according to Census Bureau figures.
</P>
<P>
   But for others in Sierra Blanca, the waste site would bring a
much-needed economic boost. Already, the town's largest employer,
with 40 workers, is Merco Joint Venture, the company that has
shipped 400 tons of New York City sludge every day since 1992 to a
128,000-acre ranch outside town.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk down the lone commercial strip, past the ice cream
parlor, a couple of auto repair shops and a boarded-up movie
theater, James Schilling was putting the finishing touches on the
Sierra Motel, a 67-year-old fieldstone complex that he is
renovating.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the low-level nuclear site, I'm all for it, and most of
the town is for it, too,'' Schilling said. ``We need progress in
this town, and this facility will bring money and jobs here. I feel
it will be safe.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the U.S. Senate is expected to vote on the
proposed three-state compact, which has been approved by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Several residents of Sierra Blanca joined Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., who has been the project's most vocal congressional
opponent, for a rally on the Capitol steps Tuesday hoping to sway
the vote. During Senate debate Tuesday night, Wellstone said, ``It
is a fight for communities all across the country who don't have
political clout.''
</P>
<P>
   If the proposal passes the Senate, as even many of its opponents
believe it will, then all it will need is President Clinton's
signature to become a reality. It would be the 10th such compact
created since the 1980 passage of a federal law urging states to
cooperate in dealing with the disposal problems of low-level
nuclear waste, which includes medical waste and parts and machinery
from nuclear power plants that have become contaminated. States
that enter a compact have some protection from the federal
government's forcing them to accept waste from other states.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of the compact would give Texas permission to build
the site and provide much of the money for it, said Lee Mathews,
general counsel for the Texas Low-level Radioactive Waste Disposal
Authority, which has been looking since the early 1980s for a
disposal site.
</P>
<P>
   But the authority would still need a license from the state.
Earlier this summer, two administrative law judges in Austin ruled
that the authority's application for the license should be rejected
because it failed to include a thorough geological survey of the
site or a proper assessment of the proposal's socio-economic impact
on Sierra Blanca and surrounding Hudspeth County.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission,
comprised of three officials appointed by Gov. George W. Bush, is
not bound to follow the judges' ruling and can approve the license.
Many environmentalists expect the commission to do so. Bush, who
had supported the project, says he is ``troubled'' by the decision
of the judges and has urged the commission to ``thoroughly review
this recommendation and the facts to make their decision on sound
science and the health and safety of Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   David Frederick, a lawyer for the Sierra Blanca Defense Fund,
which was formed to fight the compact, said he thought there was
``a real chance the commission will uphold the judges and reject
the application.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The common wisdom, however,'' Frederick said, ``is that they
will not.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission can make its ruling at any time, but it is not
expected to until at least the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The march to a low-level waste facility has been a long one for
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   An initial site selected in the early '80s in northern Hudspeth
County was withdrawn following a storm of protest from residents. A
second plan to locate the facility in South Texas, in the
scrublands between Laredo and Corpus Christi, was scuttled by
objections from ranchers who instigated passage of a law mandating
that the site be built only on state-owned land. Since most of that
land is in West Texas, it pushed the waste disposal authority back
into Hudspeth County, Mathews said.
</P>
<P>
   A third site was selected in 1986, this time in Fort Hancock,
near the El Paso County line. But the City of El Paso fought the
proposal. Finally, in 1991, a judge ruled against the site and it,
too, was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, a new state law had been passed mandating that the
facility be built within a 400-square-mile box of land in Hudspeth
County.
</P>
<P>
   The site the authority came up with was a 16,000-acre ranch
outside Sierra Blanca that the state bought from private owners.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists rose up in opposition to this new site,
charging that it was geologically unsound, that it had been
developed over known earthquake faults, and that it was chosen not
for proper scientific reasons but because the area's residents were
predominantly poor and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, you and I both know this,'' Frederick said. ``These
people are low- income, minority populations. They do not have a
strong spokesperson in state government. It's obvious that this
area was selected because it did not have the financial or
political strength to pose serious opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Project leaders say that the Sierra Blanca site was the best one
available and that its selection had nothing to do with the town's
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The project has also drawn vehement opposition from politicians
across the Mexican border, particularly officials in nearby
Coahuila and Chihuahua and in the Mexican Legislature. A city
councilman from Juarez and several supporters staged a hunger
strike on one of the international bridges in El Paso. A delegation
of Mexican officials flew to Austin to protest the project, but
were rebuffed in efforts to meet with Bush. Mexico's ruling party
accused the United States of ``economic racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the facility point to the improvements that have
already come from tax money turned over to Hudspeth County for its
decision to take the waste: a new football field, a library, a
medical clinic, a new fire truck.
</P>
<P>
   And after the facility is built and operating, the money will
continue to flow, proponents say. And there will be an estimated
three dozen jobs at the facility and maybe a few more at businesses
catering to these new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mathews said that if the state license was granted later this
year, as he expects it will be, the authority will still need to
appeal to the Texas Legislature early next year for construction
money.
</P>
<P>
   Even if all goes well, Mathews said, the first shipment of waste
would not arrive in Sierra Blanca until late 2000 or early 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Blanca, some 90 miles southeast of El Paso, was once a
ranching and railroad center. Now it is little more than a stretch
of commercial buildings along a feeder road between two exits on
Interstate 10, separated from the Rio Grande by the boulder-strewn
Quitman Mountains that create a sawtoothed silhouette in the desert
haze.
</P>
<P>
   There are three gas stations, three restaurants, a couple of RV
parks, two motels, a general store, a grocery, a post office and a
former rail depot that is now a county museum commemorating the
moment in 1881 when the Southern Pacific's tracks met the Texas
Pacific's right here in Sierra Blanca. The museum is open 1 to 5
p.m., Wednesdays only.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mendez, a retired school aid from Allamoore, was part of
the delegation that went to Washington this week to protest the
compact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Ms. Mendez said Tuesday. ``I think Sierra
Blanca was chosen for all of this dumping because we don't have any
political clout. I think it's a racism thing, I really do. Here we
are, the hugest dump in the whole world. First sludge, now nuclear
waste. Our home has been taken over as the nation's dumping
ground.''

CHARLES HASKELL, 55; RECREATED BOLD TRAVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Va.)   (bl)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles T. Haskell, an environmentalist and adventurer who
recreated perilous historic expeditions in South America and Africa
with descendants of famous explorers, died Aug. 18 at a hospital in
Winston-Salem, N.C., near his family home. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer of the thymus, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Haskell led an expedition in Brazil, recreating a 1914
adventure by former President Theodore Roosevelt. The modern
journey was to help educate Brazilians and Americans about the
importance of the environment and how many issues had not changed
since the 1914 exploration, Haskell said then.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell and his group of 20 Americans and Brazilians spent more
than four weeks winding their way down a 930-mile tributary of the
Amazon that once was called the River of Doubt. The party, which
included Tweed Roosevelt, a great-grandson of the 26th president,
braved similar perils and discomforts that had been experienced 78
years before.
</P>
<P>
   The group found many spots chronicled by the former president in
his book, ``Through the Brazilian Wilderness,'' and followed an
extremely accurate map drawn by his partner, Candido Rondon,
Brazil's premier Amazon explorer. After the 1914 expedition, one of
the first to chart the headwaters of the Amazon, the river was
renamed Rio Roosevelt, which flows from tributaries in a state now
called Rondonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Theodore Roosevelt had been with us, he wouldn't have been
surprised by most of what we saw,'' Haskell said after the
expedition. During his trip, Roosevelt nearly died from malaria and
a leg infection.
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's book inspired Haskell and the expedition's
co-leader, Elizabeth McKnight, who later became his wife, to plan
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Haskell and his wife organized a second major
expedition, one that took them through Africa retracing David
Livingstone's last journey in 1872-73. Accompanied by Livingstone's
great-grandson, David Livingstone Wilson, the team went from
Zanzibar, in eastern Africa, to Burundi and into Zambia. The
expedition, comparing observations from Livingstone's writings,
documented significant environmental changes that had occurred over
more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   After the expeditions, Haskell lectured extensively on
environmental issues, the need for conservation and the importance
of studying history.
</P>
<P>
   Charles T. Haskell was born in Martinsville, Va., the son of
Antoinette M. and Robert H. Haskell Jr., and attended the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst. After leaving college, he
worked for about 20 years at The Mount Sterling Advocate, in
Kentucky, one of several newspapers owned by his family. He was
editor and publisher of the paper when he retired in 1989. In
recent years, he and his wife lived in Harpswell, Me.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell was also involved in Mount Sterling politics, serving as
a city councilman and, briefly, as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   He was closely affiliated with the National Wildlife Federation,
which co-sponsored the 1992 Brazilian expedition, and served on the
federation's board of directors from 1985 to 1991. He served on the
federation's endowment board from 1987 through 1994 and was
chairman for three years. He also was a member of the Explorers
Club in New York and a member of the board of Gallaudet University
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a big, burly man who loved expeditions and adventure,
but he wanted to use his experiences to teach people about the
natural world,'' said Mark Van Putten, president of the wildlife
federation. ``His enthusiasm was infectious, and that's what made
him so effective.''
</P>
<P>
   At a memorial service for Haskell in Martinsville on Aug. 21,
the federation honored him with the Virginia Ball Founders Award,
one of its highest honors. In 1992, he received the Theodore
Roosevelt Association's distinguished service award.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his mother and wife, Haskell is survived by a son and
three daughters from previous marriages: Charles T. Jr., of
Annapolis, Md.; Jennifer and Erin, both of Denver, and Kari, of New
York City. He is also survived by a brother, Robert H. Haskell III
of Martinsville.

JAMES A. WASHINGTON JR., 83, JUDGE AND DEAN OF LAW SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., N.C. ) (fb)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Aaron Washington Jr., a retired District of Columbia judge
and Howard University law dean who helped to formulate the Supreme
Court case that resulted in the 1954 decision against school
segregation, died on Saturday in his home in Silver Spring, Md. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, who was left partly disabled by a fall in 1976,
retired from District of Columbia Superior Court in 1984. Besides
his teaching career at Howard, he held a number of government posts
before being named to the bench in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   He was a legal expert who worked for the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People preparing arguments against
racial separation in public schools. The goal was to overturn the
Supreme Court's 1896 Plessy vs. Ferguson precedent that established
the doctrine of separate but equal.
</P>
<P>
   Having gained expertise in years of earlier civil rights
litigation, Washington worked with teams that drew up briefs, held
moot court exercises and tested presentations for the cases that
culminated in Brown vs. Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Asheville, N.C., he graduated from Howard in 1936,
took his law degree there in 1939 and earned a master of laws
degree at Harvard Law School in 1941. After working in the war
division of the Justice Department, he joined the Howard faculty as
a professor of law in 1946. He became dean of the law school in
1969 after three years as Langston Professor of Law.
</P>
<P>
   He served on several District of Columbia commissions and headed
the Police Community Relations Institute of the National Conference
of Christians and Jews. From 1969 until he was named to the bench,
he was general counsel of the Federal Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
   His judicial career nearly ended in 1976 with a fall that broke
his neck and severely injured his spinal cord, but he returned to
work in a wheelchair a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's wife, Ada Collins Washington, died in 1987 after 51
years of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by four daughters, Dr. Grace C. Cooper of
Lewisdale, Md.; Eleanor J. Jackson of Fort Washington, Md.; Vivian
A. Johnson of Upper Marlboro, Md., and Diana V. Smith of
Washington; and by four sons, Dr. James A. 3rd, of Fort Washington;
Michael G., of Baltimore; Carleton C., of Washington, and Stephen
C., of Kalamazoo, Mich.; and 16 grandchildren and 11
great-grandchildren.

DETROIT PAPERS ORDERED TO REHIRE STRIKERS AND PAY BACK WAGES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruling that two Detroit newspapers had not bargained in good
faith, the National Labor Relations Board Tuesday ordered them to
rehire hundreds of reporters, drivers, pressmen and other workers
who went on strike three years ago and to give them millions of
dollars in back wages.
</P>
<P>
   The board said that to make way for the reinstated workers, The
Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press might also have to lay off
hundreds of employees hired as permanent replacement workers during
the strike, which began in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders called Tuesday's decision, which upheld part of
federal administrative law judge's 1997 ruling, a major victory.
The six unions, including the teamsters, the typographers and the
Newspaper Guild, estimated that 1,200 workers who went on strike
were awaiting reinstatement, but the newspapers put the number at
642.
</P>
<P>
   The board found that the unfair labor practices were a cause of
the strike. Under federal law, employers may not use permanent
replacement workers to displace employees participating in such a
strike, and are required to pay back pay.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials estimated that the company owed about $80
million in back pay, a sum the newspapers are expected to challenge
as too high. Workers who found jobs elsewhere are eligible to
return and are entitled to back pay amounting to their lost salary
minus whatever pay they received in other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Mark Silverman, publisher of The Detroit
News, said the newspapers would appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The board ordered the newspapers to reinstate the workers within
21 days, although that order is likely to be delayed pending
appeal. The newspapers also said they would not lay off any
replacement workers to make way for the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   The unions were badly hurt during the strike by nearly 2,500
workers because the two newspapers continued operating. But the
strike also hurt the newspapers, which lost more than $100 million
and saw their combined circulation plunge to 600,000 from 900,000
when the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally Tuesday in Detroit, workers said the ruling was the
best news for them since the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with the decision,'' said Shawn Ellis, a
teamster who drives a newspaper delivery truck and is a spokesman
for the Detroit Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions. ``Now
it's time for company officials to take this opportunity to make
this community whole again and to create quality journalism in the
Detroit area again.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers struck after rejecting the newspapers' plans to buy
out several hundred union jobs and reorganize the distribution
system. In February 1997, 19 months after the walkout began, the
strikers agreed to an unconditional offer to go back to work, but
were taken back only as openings developed. Management said the
agreement was a surrender, but the union continued its litigation
of unfair labor practices and urged a boycott of Detroit
Newspapers' parent companies, Gannett and Knight Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   The board, three Democrats and two Republicans, was unanimous in
its main points. It found that the newspapers had failed to bargain
in good faith because after insisting that all raises be based on
merit, they repeatedly declined to tell the unions how a merit
system would work and how much money would be put into the merit
raise pool.

JACOBS BACKS AWAY FROM DEAL FOR BROWNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Thomas Murdough Jr. is cq; s and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jeremy Jacobs, owner of the Boston Bruins, will not be
the owner of the new Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Officially ending his pursuit of what will likely be the most
expensive franchise in sports, Jacobs cited ``personal reasons'' in
a letter delivered to the National Football League Tuesday,
according to his spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has a clear rule that no owner of a sports franchise in
the same market as an NFL team may own another NFL team, but
sources close to Jacobs had said that he entered the competition to
own the Browns hoping that something could be worked out to skirt
that.
</P>
<P>
   He has insisted publicly that he would never sell the Bruins,
and Jacobs's withdrawal from the Browns sweepstakes puts that issue
to rest for now.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs closed down his effort on the same day that two other
candidates pulled out of the high-priced process rather than
submitting proposals during a second round of bidding Tuesday.
Richard Jacobs, owner of the Cleveland Indians, who is no relation
to Jeremy Jacobs, and Thomas Murdough Jr., founder and president of
a large Ohio toy manufacturing company, also withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   Murdough said additional information, including financial data,
that was made available to prospective owners persuaded him to
withdraw, despite a desperate attempt to form an alliance with
Richard Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   An NFL official said the withdrawals were no surprise, and that
the process is largely unaffected by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they realized that the price was only going to go
higher, and they just decided it was too steep,'' the official
said. ``As for Jeremy, I don't know if it was so much the price as
the cross-ownership issue with the Bruins, and what would become of
that if he continued on in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The second round of bids was due by noon Tuesday. Jacobs moved
to pull the plug on his efforts in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were still doing a lot of due diligence work around here,
right up until recently,'' said Brenda Fullmer, a spokeswoman for
Jacobs's Delaware North Companies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs would have made his decision to withdraw known earlier,
Fullmer said, ``but he did not want to do anything to jeopardize
the bidding process.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the cross-ownership issue had influenced the
decision, Fullmer said, ``I don't know what the legal
interpretation of that issue would have been, but he has said in no
uncertain terms that he would not sell the Bruins.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to Jacobs had said that his intention in
contending for the Browns was to reach an accommodation that would
have allowed him, or members of his family, to own both teams.
Jacobs has two sons.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers, who know Jacobs well, speculated that in
addition to being truly interested in owning the Browns, he entered
the process to establish closer relations in the community of NFL
owners to help further Delaware North's role as a dominant sports
concessionaire, and perhaps as a prelude to take a run at owning
the Buffalo Bills. Delaware North is located in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, the Browns are clearly a handsome catch, with a new
stadium already under construction in a partnership between public
and private financiers and a solid fan base that clearly has not
diminished since the Browns moved to Baltimore and became the
Ravens. Observers say the franchise will garner at least $500
million, and some estimate the eventual price tag may be
substantially more.
</P>
<P>
   Those still bidding to own the Browns are:
</P>
<P>
   _Alfred Lerner, a banker and suburban Cleveland resident, who
has been joined in his bid by Carmen Policy, the former president
of the San Francisco 49ers;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; _Howard Milstein, a New York businessman who has earned a
fortune in banking and real estate, and whose proposed ownership
group includes former Browns players Paul Warfield and Calvin Hill;
</P>
<P>
   _Bart Wolstein, a Cleveland real estate developer, who is
supported by former Browns great Jim Brown;
</P>
<P>
   _Lawrence Dolan, a Cleveland lawyer, and his brother, Charles
Dolan, founder of New York-based Cablevision Systems Corp., one of
the largest cable providers in the country. The Dolan group
includes former Dolphins head coach Don Shula and comedian Bill
Cosby as limited investors.

 RALPH CASO, 80, LED NEW YORK'S NASSAU COUNTY IN 1970s  
 (bl)  
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ Ralph G. Caso, who during his eight years as
Nassau County executive in the 1970s led efforts to build housing
for the elderly, construct the Nassau County Veterans Memorial
Coliseum and expand the county park system, died Aug. 31. He was
80.
</P>
<P>
   Caso, who had a history of heart problems, died of pneumonia at
South Nassau Communities Hospital in Oceanside, a family spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Caso, a Republican, had many battles with Nassau
Republican Party leaders, he managed to pursue an aggressive agenda
during his two terms as county executive, from 1971 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had visions and was able to translate them into brick and
mortar,'' said Joseph Mondello, leader of the Nassau County
Republican Committee. ``He put the Coliseum where it is, brought
the Islanders and Nets here and left a tremendous mark on Nassau.''
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of New York University Law school and a veteran of
World War II, Caso practiced law in Merrick before beginning his
political career in the town of Hempstead, where he was supervisor
from 1961 to 1965 and presiding supervisor of Nassau County from
1965 to 1970. It was there that his reputation as a
brick-and-mortar leader began when he added a new wing to Hempstead
Town Hall.
</P>
<P>
   While county executive, he initiated plans for development of
the Nassau County Medical Center and some of the county's first
housing for the elderly, including the Green Acres complex in
Valley Stream.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a driving force to build and expand,'' said Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, who also started his rise through Republican ranks
in the town of Hempstead, and who followed Caso as supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of Caso's second four-year term, Republican leaders
had grown to believe that he had too many opponents to win election
to a third term. After a bitter party primary, Caso was replaced on
the Republican ballot by Francis Purcell. Caso continued to run as
an independent, but lost in the general election to Purcell.
</P>
<P>
   During the campaign, Caso purged those he believed to be
supporters of Purcell from appointed office, further extending his
feud with Joseph Margiotta, who was the Republican county chairman.
</P>
<P>
   That feud persisted into the mid-1980s, when Caso appeared as a
witness against Margiotta in a trial in which Margiotta and the
Nassau County Republican Committee were charged with illegally
linking county hiring practices and political patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Many government workers in Nassau County testified that they
were forced to contribute 1 percent of their salaries to the

   Caso testified in 1985 that when he was county executive, he
tried to ``professionalize'' the county government by creating the
office of director of personnel. ``I wanted the people to feel free
to walk in off the street and seek a job and not have to go through
Republican headquarters,'' Caso told the court. He said he issued a
memorandum in 1971 warning against the practice of having workers
contribute 1 percent of their salaries to the party.
</P>
<P>
   Caso said it was for that and other reasons that he had a
falling out with Margiotta, who did not support his bid for a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   Margiotta stepped down as party chairman in 1983 before serving
a two-year federal prison sentence for mail fraud and perjury in an
unrelated case involving insurance fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Caso's initial differences with Purcell, the two men
ultimately ended their quarrel. ``You had to hand it to Ralph,''
said Purcell, who lives in retirement in Florida. ``He was a very
decent individual, a straight shooter and very honest.''

   Caso is survived by his wife, Grace; a son, Ralph Jr., of
Nesconset, N.Y., and a daughter, Jolisa Sagstetter of Wantagh, N.Y.

 YOUNG JETS TO GET LOOK AT LEGENDARY 49ers  
 (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ The San Francisco 49ers, the New York Jets'
season-opening opponents on Sunday, have produced 15 straight
seasons with at least 10 victories. In the late 1980s, when Jets
players who are now 23 or 24 were first turning into teen-agers,
the 49ers reeled off back-to-back Super Bowl victories, giving them
four for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Now those teen-agers are young Jets, getting ready to take on
the latest version of the 49ers and trying not to be too respectful
of an opponent that has Steve Young at quarterback and Jerry Rice
at receiver and a legacy of success as imposing as the legacy of
failure that haunted the Jets until a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Can the Jets, a team with 14 players drafted either this year or
last, really compete with the 49ers in front of a hostile crowd in
San Francisco?
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a rookie,'' said defensive end Dorian Boose, the
Jets' top draft pick this year, ``the first thing you think about
is making the team. But now I'm facing a club I have respect for.
It's an adrenaline rush playing a good team. You don't want to get
too high too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one rookie is starting for the Jets on defense: Kevin
Williams, the third-round free safety from Oklahoma State. He will
have to deal with Young and Rice while also keeping an eye on wide
receivers J.J. Stokes and Terrell Owens, who will be quite happy to
terrorize a rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any rookie on any field is going to be tested,'' Williams
said. ``It doesn't matter against what team. They're always going
to try to get at you. All you can do is be disciplined and do the
things you learned.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the 35-year-old Rice, the 14-year veteran trying to
rebound from an injury-marred 1997, Williams had this to say: ``I
know he's one of the greatest ever. I think he'll look at me as
just another player.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a tricky week for coach Bill Parcells. He always has
something up his sleeve as he looks for ways to motivate his team
against the next opponent. But Parcells is realistic enough to know
he can't make it seem as if he's putting the whole season on the
line in San Francisco in a game that, essentially, will be
difficult for the Jets to win.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Parcells knows his players believe they can
make the next step from last season's 9-7 record and that nothing
will do more for their confidence than a season-opening victory
over the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   And Parcells knows all about the 49ers. His Giants teams posted
a 3-1 record over them in the playoffs, although counting
regular-season games, his Giants and Patriots teams, combined, were
4-8 against Young, Rice, Joe Montana and Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I talk about the quality of the opposition at times?
Sure,'' Parcells said when asked how he will approach this game.
``But these guys know who Steve Young and Jerry Rice are. I don't
think you have to call attention to the opponent, but you talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But just how much do you talk about it, without putting the
other team on a pedestal? ``I say this is another game,'' suggested
cornerback Aaron Glenn. ``But a game like this gives you
confidence. If you can beat a team like this in the first game,
look at what Tampa Bay did last year. They beat San Francisco, and
went on to win their next four.''
</P>
<P>
   The only current player on the Jets who has ever faced the 49ers
while wearing a Jets uniform is linebacker Mo Lewis. That was back
in 1992, when the 49ers came East and mauled the Jets in their home
opener, 31-14.
</P>
<P>
   Did he realize he was the only Jets survivor from that game? ``I
know that,'' he said. And he knows this, too, that he wants to know
where the Jets are and that a game against San Francisco will give
him answers.
</P>
<P>
   In Lewis' opinion, it is Young, the ``general of the offense,''
who is the biggest problem the Jets will face Sunday. ``You've got
to stop the timing of the passing game, jam the receivers,'' he
said. ``You've got to get to Steve Young first.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Jets have got to keep the 49ers off Glenn Foley, as he
tries to establish himself as the Jets' quarterback. Part of that
assignment falls to the rookie right tackle Jason Fabini, who said
of the 49ers: ``Obviously, I'm very excited. This was the team of
the '80s. But I approach it thinking of what I've got to do, that
their inside guys are really quick and that this is going to be a
measuring stick.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Fabini, in a comment that revealed just how young so
much of the Jets team is, acknowledged he was still trying to get
over the surprise that he's a starter. ``I just wanted to make the
team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The Jets added place-kicker Brett Conway, who competed last
week with the incumbent, JOHN HALL, to the practice squad. ... The
Jets' opening-day record is, along with the Bills, the worst of any
original AFL team. The Jets have won 16 and lost 22 for a .421
opening day percentage. The 49ers are at 24-23-1 (.510).
</P>
<P>
   _ The 49ers, who acquired a place-kicker only last Thursday,
were still trying out punters Tuesday.

AS STOCKS SHUDDER, PATAKI'S FOES ASSAIL HIS BUDGET POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The challengers in the governor's race yesterday
pounced on the recent bad news from Wall Street, charging that Gov.
George Pataki has made the state's finances so precarious that the
stock market sell-off, if it resumes, will mean budget cuts next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever is governor next year ``will have to slash this budget
right after the election,'' said New York City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone, one of the leading Democratic contenders, at a City
Hall news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, the four Democrats in the race and
Independence Party candidate B. Thomas Golisano have warned that
the state had become far too dependent on Wall Street for its
revenues, and had too little cushioning to protect it if the market
declines.
</P>
<P>
   Similar cautions have come from state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall, a Democrat, as well as analysts on Wall Street and
academics.
</P>
<P>
   But such alarms have done little to dent the political armor of
Pataki, a Republican riding high in the polls. It remains to be
seen whether the recent decline in the stock market, if it
persists, would hurt the governor's re-election bid. A significant
drop in state revenues would not be evident for months _ probably
not until after the November election _ and its effects probably
would not be felt until the next budget year begins in April.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one knows whether the downturn is a momentary
blip, like that of last October, or a longer-term reversal of the
stock market's historic run, like the October 1987 drop.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in a volatile day of trading, stocks regained about
half the 6 percent in value they lost Monday, but indexes remain
down 15 to 31 percent from their recent highs.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's challengers see in a market decline a chance to attack
the governor at the core of his record and ideology: his claim to
be a fiscal conservative who has restrained state spending while
delivering deep tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the bottom drops out of the market and out of state
revenues, then whoever is governor is looking at budget cuts,''
James Larocca, one of the Democratic candidates, said Tuesday at a
campaign stop in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In Rochester, Golisano also railed against the state's
dependence on Wall Street, Pataki's handling of state finances and
the consequences of a falling market. The other Democratic
contenders, Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross and Brooklyn District
Attorney Charles Hynes, have made similar statements in recent
days.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Pataki said of his rivals' claims: ``Nonsense.
Nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where he
signed a bill on patients' rights in dealing with insurance
companies, the governor insisted, ``We have never counted on Wall
Street continuing to move forward the way it has.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the stock market's troubles have little effect on
Pataki's re-election bid, a long-term downturn that leaves him
struggling with large budget deficits could certainly hurt his
chances of being picked by his party to run for president or vice
president in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A sustained drop in the stock market, would, of course, hurt
government at all levels, cutting into the incomes of traders,
investors and investment firms, and lowering the taxes they pay.
The New York metropolitan region would be most affected, because it
has the nation's largest concentration of traders and wealthy
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts say that no government is at as great a
risk as New York State. Though they use more cautious language than
the candidates for governor, the analysts agree with much of what
the politicians are saying.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 50 percent of New York state's $35 billion a year in
tax revenue comes from the personal income tax, precisely the
source of revenue that would see the steepest drop in a stock
market slump. Only Massachusetts relies on the personal income tax
for a greater share of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey and Connecticut each get 41 percent of their tax
revenue from personal income levies, and New York City gets 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the last two years, New York State has enacted tax cuts
worth more than $5 billion a year to take effect in the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said time and time again that we think the out years,
given what they've promised in tax cuts, are going to be very
difficult to achieve, even without a bear market,'' said Robin
Prunty, a director at Standard &AMP; Poor's and chairwoman of the
firm's New York state credit ratings committee.
</P>
<P>
   And analysts say New York state has been less conservative than
New York City or New Jersey and Connecticut in counting on
continued revenue growth. New York state's current budget assumes
that personal incomes and income tax revenue will rise about 5
percent this year; New York City's budget actually assumes a
decline in tax revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
   New York state began this fiscal year with a surplus of more
than $2 billion, and Pataki predicted Tuesday that it will end this
fiscal year with a surplus of at least $1 billion. Even so, that
means the state is already spending money faster than it is taking
it in.
</P>
<P>
   The state already faces a $2 billion projected deficit in the
next fiscal year, and a gap of more than $5 billion the year after
that. Similar deficit predictions were made for each of the last
three years, after Pataki pushed through income tax cuts, but each
year, Wall Street came to the rescue, providing enough revenue to
turn deficits into surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is a sustained downturn, it definitely means budget
cuts next year,'' said Frank Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy
Institute, a research group based in Albany. ``Does it mean a
crisis environment? That's not clear yet. But next year's will be
an austere, difficult budget.''
</P>
<P>
   But some other analysts say that, paradoxically, a drop in the
stock market could actually increase tax revenue in the short run,
even while depressing it in the long run, delaying the pain for as
much as a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is still much higher than it was two years, three
years ago,'' said Robert Kurtter, vice president for state ratings
at Moody's Investors Service. ``So when people sell as the market
drops, they're cashing in profits, and they have to pay taxes on
those profits.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Kurtter said, ``There doesn't appear to be an immediate
risk to New York, but in the longer term, a year or two out, there
are potentially serious problems.''

PANEL DOUBTS RADIATION VICTIMS CAN BE IDENTIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa)  (mk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There is no good way to find the tens of thousands
of Americans who may have received enough radiation from
atmospheric nuclear tests to raise their chances of cancer
significantly, an advisory panel said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the Institute of Medicine, a panel of independent
experts who are mostly from universities, is the latest
contribution to an emotional and politically charged dispute over
the effect of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing from 1951 to
1962. The outside experts reviewed a study that was released last
year by the National Cancer Institute predicting 10,000 to 75,000
extra cancers because of the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The risk came from iodine-131, a radioactive product of the
explosions that got into milk after cows ate contaminated grass.
Iodine is concentrated in the thyroid.
</P>
<P>
   After the release of the report last year, some health advocates
sought screening of people who grew up downwind from the nuclear
tests. But the report Tuesday said that widespread screening would
probably result in many ``false positive'' readings, and that many
healthy thyroids would be removed as a result.
</P>
<P>
   While the cancer institute had estimated the radiation dose for
every county in the nation, the report Tuesday said data were too
scanty for such estimates and ``probably too uncertain to be used
in estimating individual exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Institute of Medicine said government credibility on
radiation had been hurt by misleading statements during the Cold
War. More recently, the medicine institute said, the cancer
institute had damaged its credibility by appearing to delay the
release of its findings.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of the panel characterized the conclusions of their
report as ``somewhat unsettling'' because they found contradictory
things: ``first, that some people (who cannot be easily identified)
were likely exposed to sufficient iodine-131 to raise their risk of
thyroid cancer and, second, there is no evidence that programs to
screen for thyroid cancer are beneficial in detecting disease at a
stage that would allow more effective treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that the number of cancers caused by the
explosions was probably closer to the low end of the cancer
institute's estimate, and that the type of cancer linked to
radiation, papillary carcinoma, was ``rarely life threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said, ``Tell that to my brother;
that's exactly what he had.'' Harkin's brother died of thyroid
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early detection and removal obviously improves your chances
immensely,'' Harkin said.

 Investors Still Playing Net Roulette with Fragile Online Stocks   By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Whoever thinks that gambling on the Web is illegal wasn't buying
Internet stocks yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about Casino Royale. Individual investors once again were
rolling the dice on some of their favorite Net stocks, flooding
their online brokers with buy orders. How else can you explain the
dramatic rebound of some of these profitless wonders?
</P>
<P>
   It appears that it's the mom-and-pops (you know who you are),
not the big institutions, that continue to buy Internet stocks
regardless of their fundamental weakness or the market's fragile
state. Trading in several Net stocks toward the end of yesterday's
session was dominated by blocks of 1,000 and 2,000 shares, which
means it was the lunch-hour day-traders who were driving back up
the prices. And that spells continued volatility for the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bubble occurs in this situation because the majority of
these people are speculating _ not investing,'' says investment
adviser Elaine Hahn of Hahn Capital Management in San Francisco,
who as a value investor shuns Net stocks.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of gamblers out there who continue to
invest in Web securities as though they were Powerball tickets sold
at 7-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Net stocks rode the recovery of the broader
market, and there was no reason for them to have been left behind.
If you consider the absurdity of yesterday's market rebound, then
Net stocks were right at home.
</P>
<P>
   Pundits were expecting some sort of positive bounce yesterday,
but few Wall Street forecasters, or any for that matter, foresaw a
full-on 288-point rally. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Stock Market
rebounded 5 percent yesterday, while the Internet Stock Index
climbed about 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  America Online shares recovered some ground during
yesterday's rally, rising about 3.6 percent to around $85. Yahoo,
another Net bellwether stock, rose about 4 percent to close around
$72.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Dow Jones industrial average recovered 3.8
percent of its decline yesterday, AOL and Yahoo seemed pretty much
in lockstep with the mature industrials. But one Net darling that
did not follow the trend was Amazon.com. The virtual bookseller saw
its shares nicked almost 5 percent, closing down around $80.
</P>
<P>
   Some fund managers pointed to a rash of dour analyst reports for
the decline, especially a short-term ``sell'' recommendation by
Merrill Lynch. But portfolio manager Kevin Landis of San Jose's
FirstHand Funds found it significant that Amazon was unable to keep
pace with its Internet counterparts despite the negative buzz.
</P>
<P>
   Landis floats the theory that some Net companies are bound to
show weakness, triggering a shakeout that eventually could bring
the segment back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Amazon's drop in the face of a tremendous recovery
should not be ignored, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking for pebbles coming down the face of the
mountain ...'' Landis says. ``(The drop) was impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The same holds true for Broadcast.com. The Dallas netcaster of
audio and video saw its shares plunge about 7 percent to around
$35, which is roughly how much they were fetching at the end of
their first day of trading. Broadcast.com had the good fortune to
go public on July 17, the day the Dow peaked. But investors were
scratching their heads as to why the netcaster didn't recover like
the rest yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of AOL and Yahoo, which have been profitable,
playing the rest of the Internet field is still a parlor game.
</P>
<P>
   If you're inclined to think that the likes of CDNow, an online
music seller, or Preview Travel, an online travel agency, deserve
share prices in the 40s _ which they once enjoyed _ I suggest you
hop in the car and head to Reno. You might find better odds.

PINES, REILLY IN TIE FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL, POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY   AND ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In what may be the most hotly contested statewide
political race of the year, state Senator Lois Pines and Middlesex
District Attorney Thomas Reilly are locked in a virtual dead heat
in the race for attorney general, according to two recent Boston
Globe/WBZ-TV polls.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent survey of 400 likely Democratic primary voters,
which was conducted by KRC Communications Research August 29 and
30, showed Reilly with a slight edge over Pines, 35 to 33 percent,
with 27 percent undecided. An earlier poll taken of another 400
likely voters Aug. 24-27 yielded statistically the same results,
but with Pines slightly ahead. Both polls have a margin of error of
5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the contentious race, both candidates have sought to
draw a sharp distinction in the role of attorney general, with
Pines touting her history as a consumer advocate and Reilly
emphasizing his time as an in-the-trenches prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But results of the first poll showed that a large majority _ 49
percent vs. 29 percent _ see fighting crime as more important for
an attorney general than consumer protection, indicating both
candidates may want to emphasize law and order over regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been what I've been saying from the very beginning of
this campaign,'' Reilly said Tuesday. ``I haven't changed that.
Crime is important, particularly what's happening around our kids
in drugs and gangs. People are concerned.... That has to be the top
priority of the attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pines _ who wrote the law allowing women more than a
day in the hospital after giving birth, and has emphasized in TV
ads that she would be the first mother elected attorney general _
polls better among female voters, 38 to 31 percent in the latest
survey. She also appealed to younger voters in the same sample.
Among those between 18 and 39, Pines leads 39 to 30 percent. Reilly
leads Pines broadly among male voters, 40 to 28 percent, and
narrowly outperforms her among voters over 65.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pines won her party's endorsement at the Democratic
convention in June, she has been lagging in recent internal polls,
according to Michael Goldman, Pines's political consultant. Goldman
said Pines is catching up because her message about how the office
should be more consumer-oriented is resonating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reilly truly believes the job is a super-DA,'' Goldman said.
``We see it as more than just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pines is a longtime state senator from Newton who once headed
the regional office of the Federal Trade Commission. Reilly has
made headlines through his prosecution of such high-profile cases
as the murder trials of Edward O'Brien and Louise Woodward.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Sept. 15 Democratic contest for attorney
general will face Republican Brad Bailey, former governor William
F. Weld's drug czar, in the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest poll, Pines, who has a liberal voting record in
the Legislature, is supported by a substantial 54 percent of those
who say they back former state senator Patricia McGovern, the only
female candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the same poll, Reilly has a 9-point lead among
moderates and a 3-point lead among conservatives planning to vote
in the Sept. 15 Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates are generally well regarded among voters. In the
first poll, when asked to assess Reilly, 40 percent viewed him
favorably, while 22 percent viewed him unfavorably. Pines's
corresponding rating was 44 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   The first poll also showed voters are split over the court case
Reilly is most closely identified with: the prosecution of
Woodward, the British au pair convicted of manslaughter in the
death of 8-month-old Matthew Eappen. A total of 40 percent approved
of Reilly's handling of the case, while 39 percent disapproved. Of
those polled, 30 percent said the case would make them less likely
to vote for Reilly, while 16 percent said it would make them more
likely; 44 percent said the case would not affect their vote.

GRAF BEGINS HER MARCH; CAPRIATI RETREATS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The women in white celebrated 25 years of equal
treatment and equal paydays Tuesday at the U.S. Open as Day 2
yielded another innocuous first round of victories for the seeded
favorites. The sport's old-girl network mingled with the teen-age
terrors, and a pair of comeback queens with sentiment on their
side, the five-time champion Steffi Graf and the Open's perennial
little girl lost, Jennifer Capriati, had their 1998 Open crusades
evolve in distinctly different directions.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Graf, who missed last year's Open while
recuperating from knee surgery, marched straight ahead into the
second round after a mildly exerting 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 dismissal of
20-year-old Corina Morariu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come in here and say I am going to win,'' said Graf,
who earned the most recent of her 21 Grand Slam crowns here at
Flushing Meadows, Queens, in 1996. ``Who knows? Maybe I can win. I
missed only one year, so it hasn't been that long.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Capriati, whose ranking of 109 is a reflection
of the muddled straits of her game, was given the daunting
opening-round assignment against third-seeded Jana Novotna. Not
surprisingly, Capriati foundered in straight sets and lost her
fourth match in four meetings with Novotna, the artistic Czech
veteran. Capriati's 6-4, 6-3 defeat marked the fourth consecutive
Open, as well as the sixth time in her last seven Grand Slam
events, that she has taken a first-round tumble.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, sixth-seeded Greg Rusedski of Britain, who
served his way into last year's final, came perilously close to
taking a first-round fall, as did 12th-seeded Jonas Bjorkman, who
outlasted 17th-ranked Cedric Pioline, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (3-7),
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski needed to squirm past two match points held by Wayne
Ferreira of South Africa before escaping with a 4-6, 7-6 (7-2),
5-7, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4 victory. Rusedski _ who was hobbled by ankle
trouble and a much-publicized divorce from his coach, Tony Pickard,
this summer _ fired just 19 aces in the 3-hour-8-minute match.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, who complained of blisters during the match and later
said he also had difficulty adjusting to the quick conditions on
the main stadium court, denied that he had placed any performance
pressure on himself at the Open: ``I'm not feeling any pressure at
all; I knew I had a difficult draw. If I win, I win. If I don't,
then I will be gone, shall we say.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who was not glad to be gone was Capriati. ``It is a
little sad in a way,'' Capriati said of the heartening reception
she received from her fans, whose post-match cheers inspired her to
stand up and raise her arms in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like I won or something,'' said Capriati, who recalled
hearing advice that ranged from ``we miss you; keep coming back''
to ``don't give up.'' ``I was a little surprised, but it makes me
feel good that they're still like that. It's encouraging. I know it
can only get better from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, at long last a Wimbledon champion after a series of
tear-jerkers there but not yet a crowd-pleaser at the Open, did not
wear a black hat into Tuesday's match with Capriati. It just seemed
that way.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Novotna wore classic whites and played her
classic game, and she was certain she had been miscast as the
villain by the full house that jammed the old Louis Armstrong
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Capriati broke Novotna for a 4-3 lead in the first set, the
crowd revved itself with anticipation, but when she gave the break
straight back by dropping her own service game at love, the buzz
turned to apprehension. And after Novotna charged to a 5-0 lead in
the second set, the mood changed to desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Secure in her victory, Novotna, who was critical of the WTA Tour
two years ago for giving Capriati's comeback attempts such a high
level of attention, tried to be polite about the enemy atmosphere
she endured while eliminating the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what can I do?'' Novotna said. ``I won Wimbledon, but
I can't expect everybody to root for me at every single tournament;
you have to realize that Jennifer has been through some tough times
and I guess it is very natural that she got such ovations. People
wanted to see a breakthrough; you just have to deal with that.''

LAWSUIT ALLEGING RAPE CITES MIT, NATIONAL FRATERNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Woman approved use of her name in suit.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A 19-year-old woman is suing Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and an MIT-related fraternity, alleging she was raped at
a Boston party in 1996 after she was served so much alcohol she was
unable to fend off her attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Colt &UR;  &LR; filed suit Monday in Suffolk Superior Court against
the university, Delta Upsilon fraternity, its national corporation,
and Matthew Keller, her alleged assailant.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, 1997, Colt was 17 and working in the Boston area when
she and a co-worker attended the Delta Upsilon party on the
roofdeck of the frat house at 526 Beacon St. in the Kenmore Square
area. The victim's co-worker was a fraternity member from another
school who was living in Delta house at the time, according to
Colt's attorney, Jeffrey Beeler of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Colt said no one at the frat checked to see if
she was of legal drinking age, nor was there any other type of
security in evidence at the party. ``Alcohol was being served
indiscriminately to minors,'' according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Colt said she met Keller, then an MIT student, at the party. In
court papers, Colt said Keller attacked her but she was
``intoxicated and otherwise impaired due to her consumption of
alcohol at the MIT fraternity'' and could not defend herself.
</P>
<P>
   Though she had the option to withhold her name in the lawsuit,
Beeler said Colt, who now attends college in California, decided to
sue under her own name.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wants to ensure that something like this doesn't happen to
others,'' he said. ``It's her hope that by taking this action, the
responsible parties will take steps to protect those in fraternity
houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Colt's lawsuit is the second recent report of a woman suing an
area university on grounds that underage drinking at a fraternity
allegedly led to rape.
</P>
<P>
   A former Boston University student recently filed a $3 million
lawsuit against the school. She contends she was raped in 1995 at a
BU-affiliated fraternity after its members served her alcohol even
though she was 17.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, &UR;  &LR; MIT spokesman Ken Campbell said Colt reported the
incident to the university's police department four days later. But
he said she refused to cooperate and would not press criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the university's policy is to drop criminal cases
when the alleged victim declines to go forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``She expressly told them that she did not want to initiate any
action against the young man,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Beeler said Colt did cooperate with Suffolk County
prosecutors. Keller was subsequently charged with rape, and
indecent assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, 1997, the charge of indecent assault and battery was
continued without a finding in Roxbury District Court, meaning
Keller's record would stay clean if he kept out of trouble. The
rape charge &UR;  &LR; was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Keller, who graduated from MIT in 1997, could not be located
Tuesday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Colt alleges that MIT had supervisory control
over the fraternity. But MIT's Campbell said Colt's lawsuit is
without merit because MIT has no direct legal control over the
actions of off-campus fraternities. He said the university rejected
settlement overtures from Colt's attorneys last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Colt was attacked one year before MIT freshman Scott Krueger
died of alcohol poisoning while attending a party at another
MIT-related fraternity in the Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Krueger's death caused MIT to examine the issue of alcohol on
campus and in fraternities. The school recently announced that
members of the class of 2001 must live on campus their first year.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Cross, executive director of the fraternity's
international corporation, said Colt's suit was the first time a
chapter has been accused of allowing sexual assault to occur on its
premises. Cross declined to comment on the details of the case.

EDITORIAL: IMPROVING SECURITY IN THE SCHOOLS
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   A draft proposal to give New York City's Police Department
significant new control over security in the schools offers a
compromise to a long-running disagreement between Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. In earlier years,
the mayor has pushed for more police in the schools and more
control over school security matters. Crew has resisted sending
more armed officers into schools and has long argued that educators
cannot be cut out of school security decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative plan, reportedly agreed to by both sides, offers a
way out of the stalemate. In a radical move, 3,200 school safety
officers would become Police Department employees but remain
unarmed. Since the school bureaucracy has done a dismal job of
selecting and training safety officers, a Police Department
takeover makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Crew would retain the final say on where the safety
officers are deployed, and principals would still control most
security and disciplinary decisions in the buildings, such as
suspending students for unruly behavior. That makes sense because
security should be addressed within the context of a school's
educational mission.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would not increase the number of regular police
officers already patrolling 130 schools at the invitation of the
principals. Nor would any school be assigned a police officer
absent a request from a principal. That is also appropriate. The
issue of police in the schools has been controversial in many
minority communities where high levels of suspicion exist about
police tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Many details are still being negotiated, such as the need to
maintain confidentiality of student records. But the schools need
help improving security, and the Police Department is the place to
get it.

BATTERED MOUSE BACK FROM THE BRINK?

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Is it time to load up on Mickey Mouse again? Has
he been punished enough?
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Burbank-based Walt Disney Co. rose nearly 11 percent
Tuesday in the first positive news for shareholders all summer,
gaining $2.9375 to $30.375 to erase all but 25 cents of Monday's
loss.
</P>
<P>
   But that's little relief for stockholders, since Wall Street has
spent the summer knocking down the entertainment giant. Since
hitting a split-adjusted high of $42.33 on May 4, Disney dropped
more than 35 percent through Monday's meltdown, making it the
second-worst performer among the Dow Jones industrial average's 30
blue chips in that time. Only Boeing Co. turned in a worse
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's gain lifted Disney to 24th place from 29th among the
Dow 30 since it peaked four months ago. Aside from Monday's $3.1875
decline, the worst day came on June 30 -- a $2.71 plunge to $35.03
after seven analysts cut earnings estimates due to disappointing
results in movies, videos and consumer products.
</P>
<P>
   Disney subsequently posted better-than-expected returns for
three late-summer movies: ``Armageddon,'' with nearly $189 million
in domestic grosses; ``The Parent Trap,'' over $56 million; and
``Halloween: H20,'' topping $50 million. With foreign, video and TV
revenues included, all should be solidly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, the stock's ongoing decline has led several
analysts to conclude Disney may now be significantly undervalued.
``We are definitely telling investors to take advantage of the
opportunity to purchase high-quality companies like Disney,'' said
Linda Bannister of Edward Jones &AMP; Co., who recently repeated a
``strong buy'' rating. ``It could go into the low $40s but that
really depends on overall trends in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Halpern of ING Barings Furman Selz reiterated his buy
rating Tuesday and predicted the stock will hit $40 at the end of
the year and $48 to $50 at the end of 1999. He noted that at the
$27.50 price, its relative valuation was lower than in 1991, when
the recession knocked theme-park attendance and broadcasting ad
spending to their biggest declines in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the relative valuation is compelling,'' Halpern
said, noting the stock was 44 percent below the average of global
consumer-brand-driven stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern projected Disney's performance in the current quarter
ending Sept. 30 will continue on track with previously issued
estimates. He said theme-park attendance is holding up while
creative content (which includes movies and videos) has improved
over last quarter despite continued slowness in Asia.

WASHINGTON'S NEW SALUTE TO COMPROMISE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ill.)   (af)  
 By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bad things happen to good architects. James Ingo
Freed is the man who designed the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum, one of the most powerful buildings of our time. It gives me
no pleasure to report that Freed's most recent project, the Ronald
Reagan Building, is a disappointing piece of work.
</P>
<P>
   The building has intermittent merit. It is an impressive feat of
urban planning. It also offers some fine interiors and an excellent
outdoor space. Its flaws are mostly the result of the design
constraints under which Freed was compelled to operate.
</P>
<P>
   He was expected to design a neo-classical edifice of stone, as
if in 1998 that concept were still able to fill anything larger
than a Bart Simpson frame of values. As someone once said, the
scariest sentence in the language is, ``Everyone has their
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   This building is such an overwhelming monument to compromise
that one comes away resenting the talent, intelligence, materials,
time and space absorbed by its creation.
</P>
<P>
   Officially called the Ronald Reagan Building and International
Trade Center, this edifice is second in size only to the Pentagon
among federal buildings. Freed, of Pei Cobb Freed &AMP; Partners,
designed it in association with the Washington office of Ellerbe
Becket Architects and Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   It fills in the last empty plot of ground in the Federal
Triangle, the 70-acre urban slice that fans out between the Mall
and Pennsylvania Avenue. Physically and symbolically, the Triangle
both joins and separates the executive and legislative branches of
government.
</P>
<P>
   The area is slightly larger than Vatican City, though its
turn-of-the-century image did not occupy high moral ground. A
century ago, the Triangle was called the Hooker District for the
many brothels there. Now it houses the National Archives, the
Departments of State and Commerce, and the Internal Revenue
Service. The grand neo-classical faces of these huge, foursquare
buildings hark back to a time before federal bureaucracy became a
term of contempt.
</P>
<P>
   The project began with an idealistic vision. The concept was to
pull together beneath one roof a cultural center and agencies for
international trade. What a wonderful idea: a government building
dedicated to the historical and continuing interaction between
global trade and cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the cultural components, mainly performance spaces, were
largely eliminated from the project in 1992. As realized, the
Reagan Building houses some small government agencies, private
business offices, shops, restaurants and the Woodrow Wilson Center.
Essentially, it is a speculative real estate venture built on
public land. The major disappointment is that the building itself
makes no cultural contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The site is a vast irregular space, just south of the Post
Office Building, left vacant when work on the Triangle was halted
in the late 1930s. For decades, the lot was used for parking. In
plan, it looks something like a guitar after a mad rock star has
smashed off part of the handle.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Holocaust Museum, this building has a dual personality.
Its neo-classical limestone exterior belies the modern spaces
within. At the Holocaust Museum, however, Freed subverted the
classical vocabulary to create a gaunt, hauntingly sinister facade,
an image that evokes the official face of a totalitarian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he gives us neo-classicism straight, without even a whiff
of postmodern irony. There are rusticated stone bases, ionic
columns, arches both round and square, two little round tempietti,
windows with triple-layered stone reveals. This overwrought
classicism is the kind that Louis Sullivan, in 1893, predicted
would set American architecture back by 50 years. Do I hear 100?
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, Freed has attempted to realize the
modernist ideals of structure and clarity that have guided most of
his work. Beyond the main entrance, on 14th Street, is the
building's main public space, a vast atrium with an exposed metal
framework that rises toward a glass roof in the form of a
half-cone.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement is similar to Cesar Pelli's Winter Garden at
Battery Park City: glazed atrium; palatial staircase; a ring of
shops and restaurants; art gallery. But instead of looking out
toward the Hudson River, this atrium faces an imposing mezzanine
adorned with a brilliant neon sculpture by Keith Sonnier.
</P>
<P>
   Freed's other major departure from Beaux Arts precedent is the
interior circulation. Instead of axial symmetry, the organization
of halls and corridors reflects the site's irregular shape.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the diagonal criss-cross of an airport's runways and you
gain some impression of the effect. The plan is mildly disorienting
but never boring. This is not a bureaucratic Kafkaland.
</P>
<P>
   What remains of the building's initial program of performing
arts is a small but exquisite auditorium, its walls festooned with
swags of copper-colored fabric, acoustically functional and
visually ravishing. A large illuminated grid of white opaque glass
_ an Adolf Loos marquee _ rises two stories in the hall outside the
theater.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Behind the building is a large plaza, the most successful
element of the design. Fronting upon the grand hemicycle of the
Post Office Building, the design counters this curve with a long
diagonal wall to create a dynamic public space. The Reagan Building
reaches out toward the hemicycle with a pavilion that will house
the Woodrow Wilson Center.
</P>
<P>
   The pavilion's attentuated curve is balanced in the center of
the plaza by a two-story tempietto designed for an upscale
restaurant. The space offers a grand procession toward a Metro stop
and is adorned by a perfectly scaled sculpture by Martin Puryear.
</P>
<P>
   The work resembles at once an exclamation point and a punching
bag: a fine symbol of the emotions evoked by a government of, by,
for and against the people. Best of all is a long arcade facing out
on the courtyard, and stretching its full length. It is divided
into shallow bays, each outfitted with a lamp of exaggerated
length. The spatial proportions may remind visitors of a first
childhood trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I listened to the recording of Maria Callas' Juilliard
master class in which she says good-bye to her students. Callas
tells them that it makes no difference whether she keeps on singing
or not. They are the younger generation, they must keep on going in
the proper way, with courage, phrasing and diction: not with
fireworks, or for easy applause, but with the expression of the
words, and with feeling.
</P>
<P>
   If I hear her correctly, what she is saying works to take the
measure of this building. External authority _ a musical score, an
urban context, the classical tradition _ can be properly grasped
only by an artist's courageous acceptance of her internal
authority.
</P>
<P>
   This building lacks that acceptance. The city has been denied
the knowledge Freed has gained in a lifetime of distinguished work,
integrity and intellect.
</P>
<P>
   As a former dean of the Illinois Institute of Technology, once
headed by Mies van der Rohe, Freed needs no architecture critic to
remind him that Mies was the heir to neo-classicism in this
century, and that the Reagan Building was an opportunity to rethink
neo-classicism in the light of that history. All those pilasters
and cornices are just so much fireworks, easy applause.
</P>
<P>
   This should have been a glass building, a literal and metaphoric
reflection on Classicism and the City Beautiful movement. It would
have taken courage to insist on a modern building _ or maybe just a
serious phone call to Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose influence
on public works is potent.
</P>
<P>
   What is most deplorable about this building is that it pitches
Classicism back into exhausted debates over Traditional vs. Modern,
Conservative vs. Progressive, debates that debased esthetic
currency in the 19th century and have certainly not created
architectural value in the comic post-modern mimicry of historical
styles.
</P>
<P>
   As Freed must know, his design for the Javits Center in New York
is more authentically classical, in the principles it conveys of
structure, clarity, detail and proportions, in its relationship to
context and urban history, in its expression of personal
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Or if Moynihan was otherwise indisposed and a masonry building
had to be the order of the day, Freed might have modeled this
structure on the radical Classicism of Boullee and Ledoux, and thus
enriched the Federal Triangle with an architectural reminder of our
country's roots in the Enlightenment. Those abstracted,
18th-century designs are also among the historical sources of
Freed's architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In the Holocaust Museum, Freed, who was born in Nazi Germany,
rose to the great creative challenge of drawing upon his intense
personal experience of history's greatest evil. With greater
fidelity to his own sense of architectural diction, phrasing and
feeling, Freed might have created a building that assured modern
democracy's capital city of its own place in time.

ROBERT SMIGEL, CLINTON'S VOICE ON CONAN O'BRIEN'S SHOW  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 3:30 on a Thursday afternoon, Conan O'Brien is at
his ``Late Night'' desk at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, rehearsing the
show he'll tape two hours from now. He is talking to a photograph
of President Clinton on a television monitor.
</P>
<P>
   In a corner of the studio, seated on a wooden stool, his head on
a chin rest, Robert Smigel is doing Clinton's voice. On the
monitor, only his mouth is seen, moving in the space where the
president's mouth should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been better, man,'' Smigel says with a drawl, playing
Clinton on vacation in Martha's Vineyard shortly after his Monica
Lewinsky speech. During the sketch, Smigel, as the president,
recites a limerick in which Monica rhymes with Hanukkah, uses the
phrase ``like flies on Linda Tripp'' and denies having had sexual
relations with Scary Spice.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Smigel's real job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like a hobby, the stuff I do with Conan,'' says
Smigel, 38, who lives in Manhattan with his wife, Michelle, and
their 6-month-old son, Daniel. ``It's just vaudeville.''
</P>
<P>
   Smigel's ``serious'' occupation is writing cartoons for
``Saturday Night Live.'' He is the creator of the Ambiguously Gay
Duo, an affectionate pair of Batman-and-Robin-style superheroes
surrounded by phallic symbols, and the X-presidents, former White
House residents with superpowers.
</P>
<P>
   Smigel, who works with J.J. Sedelmaier, an animator, is not on
the regular ``Saturday Night Live'' writing staff, although he once
was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just Cartoon Boy,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy was not Smigel's original career plan. He was supposed to
be a dentist, like his father, who developed tooth bonding. (What
symmetry that the only parts of Smigel seen on television now are
his lips and gleaming white teeth!)
</P>
<P>
   Smigel was reared in Manhattan, first on the Upper West Side,
then on the Upper East Side, by parents whose child-development
philosophy, he says, was just to keep him and his sister alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to a school that was across the street because there
was less chance of me dying,'' he says. His childhood memories
include participating in protest marches as a little boy and
getting laughs by teasing classmates (``I was very cruel'').
</P>
<P>
   He lasted two years in Cornell University's pre-dental program,
then came home to study communications at New York University.
Eventually he graduated, with a degree in political science, but
only after having won a stand-up-comic contest, so he began
appearing at comedy clubs.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Chicago to study with a workshop affiliated with the
Second City comedy troupe and helped form a comedy group, All You
Can Eat.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Al Franken and Tom Davis saw that group perform and
hired Smigel as a ``Saturday Night Live'' writer. He stayed seven
years, writing memorable sketches (like the one in which William
Shatner, the guest host, tells a convention hall full of Trekkies
to ``get a life'') and meeting, among others, Dana Carvey and
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   He was a producer of Carvey's short-lived prime-time series
(1996) and producer and head writer of ``Late Night With Conan
O'Brien'' in its first years, which may explain why he feels
particularly at home on the set.
</P>
<P>
   Smigel will probably be around for a while, not only as the
president but as his favorite new character, Triumph the
insult-comic dog. Imagine Don Rickles as a hand puppet, with a
cigar.

PROTEIN SEEMS TO PREDICT LETHAL PROSTATE CANCERS, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to fix spelling of prostate in headline) (nk) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
here have found that a protein seems to predict which prostate
cancers are likely to be deadly and warrant aggressive treatment
and which can be controlled with less treatment or perhaps none at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, published this week in The Journal of the
National Cancer Institute, also support the current understanding
that benign enlargement of the prostate, which occurs in many men
as they age, is an entirely separate development from prostate
cancer and does not lead to it.
</P>
<P>
   The studies involve a protein called p27, which other research
suggests plays an important role in controlling the growth of many
cancers that arise in lining tissues throughout the body. Studies
in Boston, Seattle, Toronto and England have linked abnormally low
levels of the p27 protein to aggressive cancers of the breast, the
colon, the lung and the esophagus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This protein represents a common mechanism that helps to
control and regulate cell growth,'' explained Dr. Howard Scher, who
directs genitourinary oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. ``It
may help us predict who will be cured and who won't, and help
determine who may need additional treatment to improve the chance
of cure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Carlos Cordon-Cardo, director of molecular pathology at
Sloan-Kettering, said p27 acted like a brake that kept cell growth
in check. When levels of this protein are low or absent, cells are
likely to proliferate rapidly. Rapid cell growth can increase the
chances of genetic mutations that may allow a cancer to develop and
grow uncontrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Cordon-Cardo explained that men with prostate cancer have a
normal gene that regulates the production of the p27 protein. But
in those with an aggressive prostate cancer that is most likely to
spread and be fatal, the tumor seems to have ``a professional
blender'' that chews up the protein. In men with less aggressive
tumors that may be curable without extensive treatment, p27 levels
are much higher, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two tumors may look alike under the microscope,'' Cordon-Cardo
said, and ``yet one patient may go on for years without the cancer
spreading, and the other may die of his cancer in two years. If we
can prognosticate at the time of diagnosis, we can determine who
should be treated more aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   In treatment of prostate cancer, the choices include radical
surgery, radiation therapy, radioactive implants, hormonal control
and chemotherapy, all of which involve varying degrees of both
short-term and long-lasting side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The emerging understanding of p27's role in cancer grows out of
previous work by Dr. Joan Massague and Dr. Andrew Koff, molecular
biologists at Sloan-Kettering who first isolated and cloned the
protein. Koff showed that mice without the p27 gene developed
overgrowth of the prostate gland, similar to the growth that occurs
in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
</P>
<P>
   In men with this benign condition, the p27 gene is inactive, and
little or no p27 protein is produced. In men with prostate cancer,
on the other hand, the gene is active, but in some cases the tumor
has the ability to chew up the protein that the gene produces.
</P>
<P>
   The degradation of p27 protein by cancers of the colon was first
described last year by Dr. Massimo Loda of the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston and Dr. Miguele Pagano of New York University.
Loda said that in colon cancer patients who initially had high
levels of the protein but whose tumors spread years later, the
protein was lost in the process of metastasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also found that p27 protein was involved in lung cancers
and breast cancers,'' Loda said.
</P>
<P>
   Scher, of Sloan-Kettering, suggested that in the future it might
be possible to identify a switch that would enable the p27 protein
to remain active and slow the growth of tumor cells.

COLUMN: KOCH RETURNS TO THE STREETS HE RESCUED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Edward Koch stood on the corner of Mapes Avenue and
East 178th Street, a Bronx neighborhood he first visited 15 years
ago to survey the desolation wrought by years of abandonment, arson
and anarchy. On Monday, he savored the sight of new homes on the
side streets, packed stores on Tremont Avenue and a sparkling new
community center.
</P>
<P>
   It was all, as he decreed, ``beauty-full.''
</P>
<P>
   The old days were gone. So, too, was his tenure as mayor. Yet,
he looked ready for the campaign trail when someone handed him a
bullhorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen,'' he said. ``I'm baaaack!''
</P>
<P>
   In a city of short memories and even shorter tempers, the man
once booed in the Bronx for being blunt (or worse) was greeted by
cheers and applause. He had gone to this neighborhood at the
invitation of Borough President Fernando Ferrer, who wanted Koch to
see the neighborhoods and lives that were changed by his $5
billion, 10-year housing plan, which he started in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   From that huge commitment, entire blocks have come buzzing back,
with children and families living in new town houses and renovated
apartment buildings. Some of those buildings used to have decals of
fake window curtains and flower boxes hiding the boards that
covered their empty interiors, which earned Koch plenty of
derision. But looking at them now, fixed up and occupied, brought
him a smile of righteous satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those tenants have forgotten Koch's role. They're used
to seeing him in his current one _ as the TV judge on ``The
People's Court.'' So, obligingly, he shared with them his own
street-corner judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful neighborhood,'' he said, as residents
leaned out their windows. ``You've really improved over the years.
And it wouldn't have happened by itself. It happened because of
some pioneers. That's what you are. You stayed and built. And the
city is grateful to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gratitude is a funny thing. Last year, when President Clinton
made his mandatory political pilgrimage to see the ranch houses on
Charlotte Street, the White House did not invite the former mayor.
So what if it was Koch who hired Edward Logue, the planner who
developed the crazy idea of creating a suburb by the subway?
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer did not forget that slight. He remembered it recently
when he inspected some town houses being built on East 181st Street
near the Bronx Zoo. He invited the former mayor to tour several
neighborhoods to see the changes for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down the block and saw some stuff he began,'' Ferrer
said. ``Thank you very much, I'm a politician and not a gourmet
chef, so I'll take my share of the credit because I've done a lot.
But Ed Koch began it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not one to shrink from praise, Koch considers his housing plan
to be one of the major legacies of his administration. He was
especially proud of how his administration began to get out of the
real-estate business by ceding ownership of abandoned buildings and
other burdensome properties to community groups and families eager
to own their own apartments for as little as $250.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would ask why we were doing this,'' Koch said of his
critics. ``Aren't we losing money? On, no no. When we own the
building we have to keep putting money into it. Now they own it.
They take care of it and it's back on the tax rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he hasn't been to the Bronx much since he left office
(except on his way to the suburbs to visit relatives), he walked
down streets as if he had never left. His arms raised high in
greeting, he stepped out of his car with a booming, ``Hi,
everybody!''
</P>
<P>
   On Topping Avenue, he inspected a new home, asking questions
about everything from the rugs to exit windows. When he stepped
back onto the sidewalk, a dozen people crowded around him while
others rushed home to get a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``How those cases going?'' Sandra Melendez asked him. ``We watch
it all the time. `The People's Court.' My man. Judge Koch.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar reception awaited on East 181st Street, where two
women leaned out a window and thanked him for visiting the block.
Soon, two police officers who had just bought homes there paid
their respects. Sonny Sankhi, an officer with the transit bureau,
told Koch that he had just moved here from the Castle Hill area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This neighborhood is totally different,'' Sankhi said. ``More
people. More kids. It's quiet. I had heard such bad stories about
this neighborhood. But I don't see that.''
</P>
<P>
   While calmer and cleaner, it is not immune from crime. Not too
far away on Third Avenue Tuesday, a man inadvertently drove into a
gunfight and was killed after being hit by a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Wilma Rodriguez, who recently bought a home on East 181st
Street, said that it was not easy being among the pioneers who
repopulated an area, but she was eager to try.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a big fight a few days ago,'' she said. ``But that can
happen anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the housing project where she once lived, where her four
daughters were crammed into one bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The projects were getting really bad,'' she said as Koch stood
in her living room. ``Hectic. Now I don't have to deal with the
urine in the elevator and the dealers always sitting in front. My
daughters have their own room. They're like, `Yes!'''
</P>
<P>
   At another stop, they visited several buildings on Fulton Avenue
that had been so far gone, the rear walls had had to be replaced.
Now, the hallways sparkled with pristine paint and spotless tiles.
Still, a few residents groused about not having a supermarket
nearby. Koch listened silently and let Ferrer do the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only want to hear the wonderful things,'' Koch said later.
``When they raise complaints, I say: `Here's your public official.
Talk to him.' That's their job. It's not just glory and success,
but to fix problems.''
</P>
<P>
   And where else was the biggest problem but on Charlotte Street,
where the few souls who braved the fires slept with their shoes by
the bed just in case. Koch calls the neighborhood ``The
Lodestone,'' a place of odd ambition that captured people's fears
and imagination.
</P>
<P>
   He took a cue from his old Snapple commercial and knocked
unannounced on a door. People flowed out from the back yard, agape.
``I love your show,'' Urceline Simmons said as she ushered the
visitors to her back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love your house,'' Koch said, as he admired how she had
spent thousands of dollars putting brick over the siding and adding
a shaded porch. Ms. Simmons dashed into her garden and offered him
a melon-sized tomato.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Bronx tomato,'' Koch marveled. ``Look at that. You
can't beat this. This is like living in Great Neck.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped cold when he walked into the parlor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' he said, looking at the furniture. ``This reminds me of
my mother. Plastic slipcovers.''
</P>
<P>
   During a quick tour, Ms. Simmons told him how she raised her
five grandchildren in this house. It wasn't easy, but it was done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming here from Jamaica, this is all I need,'' Ms. Simmons
said. ``I don't need money or nobody. I have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Koch left her home, where success is not measured by how many
out-of-towners drop by to gawk, but where life itself is the
measure of quality. Where riches come in a child's laugh, and
happiness is a Bronx tomato.

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER ITTY BITTY RENO STEP
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   By authorizing a narrowly defined investigation of whether
Harold Ickes committed perjury in Senate testimony about the 1996
election campaign, Attorney General Janet Reno is trying to buy
some time and relieve the intense congressional pressure for an
unfettered inquiry into President Clinton's fund raising. The House
and Senate Judiciary Committees, which will interview Reno
Wednesday, will not be satisfied with this latest baby step. But
they may regard the Ickes inquiry as a sign that Reno is beginning
to yield to the righteous demands from Congress and her own Justice
Department that she appoint an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's determination to block an unrestricted inquiry into the
Clinton fund-raising machine has been a disaster for the rule of
law. Both the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and
the former chief prosecutor for campaign finance, Charles La Bella,
have told her she is defying the Independent Counsel Act by failing
to step aside in favor of a prosecutor who does not answer to
Clinton. Her defense of soft-money contributions and expenditures
directed by Ickes and Clinton guts the federal Election Campaign
Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a final report before moving to another post, La Bella urged
his boss to authorize the comprehensive investigation by an
independent prosecutor. Wednesday the Judiciary Committees will
continue their efforts to see the La Bella report and to prod Reno
into action. She is certain to resist because that report will
amount to a scorching indictment of her refusal for 18 months to
let federal law enforcement answer fundamental questions about the
integrity of the electoral process.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at a small aspect of Ickes' testimony about an alleged
favor to the Teamsters or at the question of whether Vice President
Gore lied about his telephone solicitations will not provide those
answers. Only a broad examination of illegal foreign contributions,
alleged Chinese government meddling in the election and the
possible peddling of White House favors in return for soft-money
contributions can restore public confidence and politicians'
respect for campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day preliminary inquiries into Ickes and Gore could
eventually lead to the appointment of a special counsel by the
panel of federal judges that administers the Independent Counsel
Act. But the La Bella report is said to argue that there is ample
evidence for a broader, faster inquiry. So far, Sen. Orrin Hatch
and Rep. Henry Hyde, chairmen of the two judiciary committees, have
treated Reno with courtesy and more patience than she has earned.
Now that she has inched two small steps in the right direction, it
is time for them to persuade her to quit sitting on the La Bella
report and on the federal investigators who can do the job she is
shirking.

JUDGE'S CALL INCITES BRAZILIAN BOYCOTT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARRETOS, Brazil _ Though big bucks were at stake in the final
round of South America's largest rodeo last weekend, four prominent
bull riders from North America's top bull riding circuit boldly
refused to mount their final-round bulls after a controversial call
from a Brazilian judge.
</P>
<P>
   The four were Professional Bull Riders members, who advanced to
Sunday's 10-man final at Brazil's premier rodeo, dubbed the 43rd
Festa do Peao, which would offer $20,000 to the winner. But the
riders _ Terry Don West, Tater Porter, Wayde Joyal and Troy Dunn _
refused to mount their fifth and final bulls after Stephenville's
Dunn was disqualified in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   The riders became enraged after Brazilian judge Jose Roberto
disqualified Dunn for the second consecutive year at Barretos for
the same reason: sticking a spur in the knot of a bull-riding
rigging during the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, a rider is not allowed to catch his spur in
the knot of the rigging because it provides an unfair advantage for
hanging on. But PBR rules state a rider will be disqualified only
if he is caught placing his spur in the rope as he mounts the bull
inside the chute.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn was disqualified for catching his spur in the rope after he
and the bull left the chute, which clearly is not a violation of
PBR rules. And the PBR riders in Barretos emphasized that the
Brazilian judge should adhere to the association's rules since the
PBR had agreed earnings would count toward qualifying for its $1
million Las Vegas world championships in November.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian judge refused to budge, however, when Dunn
confronted Roberto about the call. Roberto also refused to back off
the decision when Barney Brehmer, a U.S. judge who shared duties
with the Brazilian, emphatically stated Dunn should not have been
disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   After the local committee reviewed the call, it declined to
reverse the decision. Although Dunn qualified for the final round
even after receiving a zero score (he fared well in the first and
third rounds), he said he no longer cared to compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any point in getting on another one,'' said Dunn,
who finished as the PBR's top money winner with more than $250,000
last year. ``This same judge shafted me last year and again this
year for the same reason. I'm not going to ride (in the final) and
give him another chance to shaft me again.''
</P>
<P>
   After Dunn refused, three other riders, including West, the
PBR's title-race leader this season, immediately followed suit.
Porter, who would have entered the final in fifth place with an
excellent chance to cash in on the average payoffs, said he has no
regrets about sticking up for Dunn and declining to ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took money out of my pocket, but I'd do it any day,''
Porter said of boycotting the final. ``We come as a team from the
PBR and we stick together as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   After the PBR's North American-based competitors declined to
compete in the final, the association might decline to allow the
earnings _ at least the average payoffs for the best aggregate
scores after five rides _ to count toward the 1998 finals
qualification standings.
</P>
<P>
   And that could be a misfortune for some very talented Brazilians
who joined the PBR last weekend, hoping they would win in Barretos,
which in turn probably would have been enough to notch a finals
berth. Paulo Kimber, an 18-year-old Brazilian who finished second
and pocketed $18,000, said he had goals of testing his skills on
the North American PBR circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's most vivid example of advancement was Rogerio
Ferreira, who qualified for the PBR's Las Vegas 1997 finals after
finishing second in Barretos and earning $15,000. Ferreira, who won
the title last weekend and pocketed $20,000, has been a marquee
competitor on the PBR's 24-city 1998 Bud Light Cup Tour in the
United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But four riders' refusals to compete after a judge's decision
Sunday appears to have damaged relations between the PBR and the
thriving Brazilian rodeo circuit. Before 40,000 romping and
stomping rodeo fans and the nation's top riders, the PBR athletes
took a costly and risky but firm stand for the rules. After all,
the PBR was established five years ago after bull riders became
frustrated from being trampled by rodeo committees and judges.

TEACHERS IMPORTED FROM SPAIN TO TEACH SPANISH IN BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may seem odd, in a city with thousands of
households in which Spanish is the dominant language, that the
Board of Education has gone all the way to Spain to find people to
teach Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But that it did, hiring seven experienced teachers for a pilot
program that will send them to two school districts in the Bronx to
teach Spanish to middle school pupils.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards, all of whom have been teachers for at least four
years, waved off warnings from friends and relatives about the
perceived dangers of the city (a few were advised to see the films
``Fort Apache, the Bronx'' and ``Bonfire of the Vanities''). They
had fears about finding affordable housing on their $29,654 annual
salaries (Soho is out; most have settled in apartments near Pelham
Parkway in the Bronx). And they heard American schoolchildren can
be unruly in comparison to Spanish schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   But a sense of adventure and a desire to teach in a diverse
environment overcame any concerns, and they arrived a couple of
weeks ago, around the same time as a group of Austrian math and
science teachers. Both groups start work when school opens next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard in general that the kids misbehave in terms of
respect,'' said Miguel Angel Casado Arroyo, 44, who is on leave
from his job teaching English as a second language at a private
school in Bilboa, Spain. ``It may be true or not. But I think if we
respect them, they will respect us.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of teachers from abroad marks the beginning of a
renewed experiment. Education officials in Scotland and
Switzerland, hearing about the 25 Austrians who will teach this
year, also have contacted the New York City Board of Education
about sending teachers to the city to fill vacancies in math and
science, said Gary Barton, who oversees teacher hiring.
</P>
<P>
   As in previous years, a handful of foreign teachers from places
like Germany and Switzerland traveled to New York on their own this
summer and found jobs in the system, which is seeking to fill 300
vacancies before school opens.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards will help alleviate a shortage of 30 to 40
teachers of Spanish, who are difficult to find because New York
City requires that they not only speak the language but also have
36 credits in the subject in college, Barton said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Spaniards are part of a program sponsored by their
country's Education Ministry, which sends several hundred teachers
to schools across the United States to teach Spanish and bilingual
education each year. They will stay for two years and work in
middle schools in Districts 10 and 12 in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Spain has sent teachers to New York City
since a failed program in the early 1980s, in which two dozen
bilingual teachers were brought in. That program ended after the
teachers complained of a lack of advice and support both from their
government and the New York City Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   But last year Education Ministry officials contacted the board
about sending a small group on a pilot basis. After a lengthy
exchange of letters, Lillian Hernandez, the director of the board's
Office of Bilingual Education and the superintendents from District
10 and 12, Irma Zardoya and Mary Rivera, flew to Spain and came
back with commitments for the seven teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hernandez said the teachers would receive more support this
time than the ones in the previous program. They will take a course
at Columbia University's Teachers College to learn the culture of
New York City's student population.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Spain's consulate in New York plan to keep close
tabs on them as well. The consulate paid for the students'
traveling expenses, housed them in the Vanderbilt YMCA in Manhattan
for two weeks and helped them find apartments.

NYC POLICE SAY PANEL WITHHELD FINDINGS AGAINST 108 OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Raising new questions about New York City's ability
to root out police brutality and misconduct, officials acknowledged
Tuesday that more than 100 cases of police misconduct were deemed
credible by the independent agency that monitors the police but
were never forwarded to the Police Department so it could
discipline the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the agency, the Civilian Complaint Review Board,
to forward the cases _ all between 1993 and 1995 _ means that the
18-month statute of limitations for disciplining the officers has
now passed, making it unlikely that any will be punished.
</P>
<P>
   The full extent of the problem and its causes were not yet clear
Tuesday, but officials at the Police Department and the review
board said it appeared that 87 complaints of police misconduct
involving 108 police officers were investigated by the review board
and found to be substantiated but were never sent on to the
department, which has the sole authority to discipline its
officers.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation that 108 officers found to have committed
misconduct were never disciplined set off new rounds of criticism
of the already beleaguered review board, caused review board
officials to blame their predecessors and led some board members to
complain that they were not apprised of the situation for months.
The problem was first reported Tuesday in The Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   While the review board has been beset with problems since it was
formed in 1993 _ most recently last December, when the board
announced that a clerical error had led it to undercount civilian
complaints and obscure a sharp increase in the complaints between
the Abner Louima case in August 1997 and the mayoral election last
November _ critics said that its failure to forward the 87 cases
was among its most serious lapses. The figure is statistically
significant to a review board that substantiates fewer than 300
cases a year, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said: ``In the five-year history of the
independent Civilian Complaint Review Board, this looms as the most
serious ineffectiveness and potentially should result in the
dismissals of the senior staff and a change in the makeup of the
board, depending on who knew what when. Eighty-seven people have
had their rights violated.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue surfaced the day after Mel Barkan resigned as chairman
of the review board and was replaced by Frank Wohl. Barkan said in
an interview that his resignation was for professional reasons and
had nothing to do with the mislaid cases.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Police Department and the review board claimed credit
for uncovering the problem. Marilyn Mode, the department's deputy
commissioner for public information, said the police discovered the
problem in the fall of 1997 when, in the wake of the Francis Livoti
case, the department began monitoring officers with numerous
substantiated civilian complaints against them for using excessive
force.
</P>
<P>
   When the department looked up individual officers in the review
board's computers, Ms. Mode said, they found that a number of
officers had been cited for substantiated complaints that were
never forwarded to the department. Ms. Mode said that the police
told the review board about the problem at a meeting Dec. 16 and in
a letter Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Barkan said the problem was discovered by the review board at
the same time that its executive director, Gene Lopez, began an
audit to try to clear up statistical discrepancies that came to
light as the board tried to prepare a report examining how many
cases were substantiated each year.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that board officials knew of the problem for nearly
eight months without telling the public or even all the members of
the board disturbed some of the members. ``Why were we only told of
it within days of Barkan's leaving?'' asked William Kuntz, a board
member who will serve on a panel to investigate the issue. ``They
run this place on a need-to-know basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkan defended his handling of the case, saying: ``I think it
was addressed appropriately, first by the staff, then by a
committee, then to the whole board and now to a panel,'' he said.
``This is for matters that were not properly handled between 1993
and 1995. I wasn't there in those years. To the degree that it was
a mess in those years, we were trying to clean this up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuntz said that the review board should have acted more quickly.
``If they discovered some cases back in December of '97, they
should have been sent on right away,'' he said. ``The notion that I
was sitting and deciding cases and that somebody wasn't handing
them over to the Police Department is a total outrage. What are we
supposed to do, lick the envelopes?''

   PETE WATROUS, 82, U.S. DIPLOMAT
</P>
<P>
   Livingston Day (Pete) Watrous, a career diplomat who specialized
in Latin America, died Sept. 1 at his home in Nantucket, Mass. He
was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Watrous joined the Foreign Service in 1940, after having
graduated from Princeton and then Columbia University, with an
advanced degree in political science. His first positions were on
the Mexican border, after which he went to San Jose, Costa Rica;
Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro, Lisbon, Paris and Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II he monitored German activity in Latin America.
Early in his career he received diplomas from the NATO Defense
College in Paris and the U.S. Army War College. His last foreign
assignment, beginning in 1964, was consul general in Cape Town,
South Africa. In 1968 he moved to the State Department in
Washington. He retired in 1971 and then moved to Nantucket, where
was director of the Nantucket Land Council.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving are his wife, Alicia; a daughter, Patricia of Tucson,
Ariz.; two sons, Livingston, of Buffalo, N.Y., and Peter, of
Brooklyn, a music critic for The New York Times; a stepson, Robert
Johnson of Harrisburg, Pa., and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ALBERT BELA BAUER, 99, CITY ARCHITECT
</P>
<P>
   Albert Bela Bauer, who oversaw the construction of public
buildings in New York as city architect for 30 years and prompted
Mayor Robert F. Wagner's 1965 executive order providing for the use
of art to adorn them, died Aug. 29 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital
Center. He was 99 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer entered the city's civil service in 1936 and retired in
1969 as the director of architecture in the Department of Public
Works. He was involved in the design and construction of scores of
hospitals, courts, correctional institutions, parking garages,
libraries and fire and police stations, including Police
Headquarters at 1 Police Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer came to the United States from his native Hungary in 1924
with a degree in architecture, and studied at the National Academy
of Design in New York.
</P>
<P>
   As he rose through the ranks in city service, he undertook the
campaign that led to the order that artworks be included in
municipal buildings. Mayor John V. Lindsay honored him as an
outstanding civil servant, and he was made a fellow of the American
Institute of Architects.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves no immediate survivors.

   Marcus just isn't soldier material. He's so quiet, so placid, so
courteous, you imagine that in the event of war, he'd be the
etiquette officer, in charge of requisitioning the napkins.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he was naive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew about (Navy) was the football, the national TV, the
Army-Navy game, playing Notre Dame,'' he said. ``I never really
thought of going into the military.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, in July 1997, when he reported to Annapolis, Md., and had
squad leaders barking in his face _ ``So you're the so-called
superstar from San Diego!'' _ he had a perfectly Marcus-like
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   He laughed. Right in Sgt. Carter's face. As a result, Marcus'
squad led the camp in pushups.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been a pretty good kid, and when that was
happening, I don't think he knew how to take it,'' said Marcus
Brady Sr., a former San Jose State defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback's father was disappointed but hardly shocked to
get a letter from Marcus, begging to come home.
</P>
<P>
   And to start looking for a new college. He'd been recruited by
Ivy League schools, Stanford and Montana, but they wanted him to
play another position, the better to exploit his speed. Brady
wanted to play quarterback, where he'd been all-league for Morse
High in Southeast San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   His dad phoned Northridge. When the Matadors coaches heard he
came from the high school that produced USC safety Rashard Cook and
tight end Lonnie Ford, they invited him for a recruiting visit.
When Brady learned about the Matadors' emphasis on passing, he'd
found a home.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you might ask, if a guy isn't cut out for the military, how
does he handle football, where the field maneuvers are just as
grueling and the drill sergeants are just as loud? The answer is
quite nicely, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, when Northridge opens its 11-game season at
Boise State, Brady will be the starting quarterback, chosen to
replace the graduated Aaron Flowers, the school record-holder in
almost every passing statistic.
</P>
<P>
   As gentle as he is, don't expect to see him chewing out
teammates for bad blocks and errant pass routes. But in every other
way, new Northridge head coach Ron Ponciano thinks he has picked
the ideal quarterback to build around.
</P>
<P>
   He's smart, a mechanical engineering major and math minor who
had no trouble absorbing offensive coordinator Ron Phenicie's
playbook while red-shirting last season.
</P>
<P>
   He's an all-around athlete, a pitcher and basketball player as
well as a quarterback in high school, with scrambling ability that
will make up for a lot of freshman mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be my best cornerback,'' Ponciano said, ``if he
played that position.''
</P>
<P>
   And the 6-foot-1, 185-pounder is the best-conditioned Matador.
Which, the coaches say, goes to show what a straight arrow the
18-year-old is.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, although the coaches encouraged players to stay
near campus and work out under team guidance, Brady went home and
lived with his father, a juvenile probation officer, and mother,
Emily, a commercial banker. He took summer school at Southwestern
Junior College and worked as a food server at the San Diego
Convention Center. And he ran, lifted and stretched so much, the
neighbors thought Marcus Sr. was operating a boot camp of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But that was just Marcus Jr. ``He was, like, on a mission,'' his
dad said.
</P>
<P>
   The results of that physical homework impressed Ponciano, who
likes to say, ``Character is what you do when nobody's watching.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the coaches watching and charting every run and pass,
Brady outperformed incumbent Josh Fiske and three other
quarterbacks in summer scrimmages. He was named the starter last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said Brady separated himself from the pack with his
poise against the pass rush. ``(Other quarterbacks) kind of
flinched,'' the coach said. ``Marcus didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed in the linemen's faces, as it were.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the image of young Marcus at the Naval Academy,
laughing at some bully in brass, had even more meaning for the
Northridge coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what I'd expect him to do,'' said quarterbacks
coach Jeff Kearin. ``If you tried to hit him with pressure, he'd
giggle at you. You're not going to break him. You're not going to
scare him.''
</P>
<P>
   Anchors aweigh, Marcus.

</P>
<P>
   Septembers are not typically stellar months for stocks. Since
1915, the average performance of the Dow Jones industrials during
the month of September is a decline of 0.74 percent. Septembers
have also become known as the month in which many corporations warn
investors of coming shortfalls in earnings.

RENO OPENS NEW INQUIRY INTO WHETHER ICKES LIED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno opened a preliminary
inquiry Tuesday into whether Harold Ickes, a former White House
aide, lied during a congressional examination of fund-raising
practices during President Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-day Justice Department investigation, which could lead to
the naming of an independent counsel, comes less than a week after
Reno initiated a similar inquiry involving Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The probe of Ickes, a key architect of the 1996 Clinton-Gore
campaign, was launched a day before Reno was scheduled to meet with
congressional leaders critical of her reluctance to turn the
fund-raising investigation over to a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's decision to investigate Ickes was prompted by a report
from the Senate Committee on Government Affairs, which accused the
former labor lawyer of ``misleading and inaccurate'' testimony
during a hearing into alleged fund-raising abuses by the White
House and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In documents filed Tuesday with a special three-judge panel of
the U.S. Court of Appeals overseeing the independent counsel law,
Reno said the 90-day investigation by Justice Department lawyers
will focus on the perjury allegations stemming from Ickes'
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the documents indicate any examination will be
made of fund-raising practices, administration officials said that
if an independent counsel is appointed, even under a narrowly
focused mandate, the investigation could be widened later.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys Robert S. Bennett and Amy Sabrin, who represent Ickes,
issued a statement denying any wrongdoing. ``Mr. Ickes has been
called upon to testify some 20 times as a result of his three years
of White House service,'' the lawyers said. ``He has testified
truthfully on all occasions. Therefore, we think such a review _
and ultimately the appointment of an independent counsel in this
case _ is unwarranted.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, President Clinton issued a statement saying Ickes had
been ``a trusted adviser and a dedicated public servant.'' The
president went on to say that he was ``confident that investigators
will find (Ickes) acted lawfully and appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   A report prepared by Justice Department lawyer Charles LaBella
described Ickes, who at the time was deputy White House chief of
staff, as the central figure in Democratic efforts to raise money
by apparently skirting campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ickes, a former labor lawyer from New York, was organizer of the
controversial White House coffees with the president and vice
president. Ickes also chaired meetings at which fund-raising
assignments were made and spending priorities were determined for
the president's re-election campaign and for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony before the Senate committee in October
1997, Ickes denied that the White House helped the Teamsters during
a labor dispute with California-based Diamond Walnut Growers.
</P>
<P>
   The committee, chaired by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., later
found internal Teamster documents indicating that Ickes asked
then-U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor to urge a Diamond
Walnut executive to help settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   An Ickes aide in 1995 had written Ickes that assisting the union
might help build ties with Ron Carey, who was then president of the
Teamsters. Ickes later discussed the issue with Bill Hamilton, the
Teamsters' director of government affairs, according to a report
issued by Thompson's committee.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Reno's decision to conduct a 90-day inquiry,
Thompson said late Tuesday that she has not gone far enough,
quickly enough. ``This, of course, is just another small piece of
the overall fund-raising scandal of 1996, for which the attorney
general still refuses to seek an independent counsel,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno on Wednesday is scheduled to meet with Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, who has repeatedly accused her of
stalling in the naming of an independent counsel to investigate
possible campaign fund-raising abuses by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Also expected to attend is Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who chairs
the House Judiciary Committee. Burton's committee last month voted
to urge the House to cite her for contempt of Congress if she does
not turn over memos written by La Bella and FBI Director Louis
Freeh urging her to seek appointment of an independent counsel.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Felicity Porter makes a last-minute decision about
where to go to college. On graduation day, when Ben Covington, the
cute boy she has loved from afar in high school, writes something
nice in her yearbook, Felicity decides to forget the premed program
at Stanford (her parents' idea, anyway) and follow Ben to New York
City. In the first episode of ``Felicity,'' the WB mini-network's
new drama series, viewers will see the title character gazing at
the application form. The letterhead says ``University of New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Where?
</P>
<P>
   When Felicity (played by Keri Russell) gets out of a taxi and
carries her luggage into her dorm, the neighborhood looks like one
of those Greenwich Village blocks near Washington Square. It looks
a lot like New York University, but it's not: It was filmed farther
uptown. Even though schools, just as Coke or Nike do, usually
welcome a free mention of their name on television, NYU said no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry that we didn't get NYU's approval'' to use the
school's name, said J.J. Abrams, co-creator and co-executive
producer of ``Felicity,'' which is to have its premiere on Sept.
29. But, he added, he understands the reluctance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not showing the university as a place of bacchanal, of
crazy, violent rampages,'' Abrams said. ``Our show is not about the
maligning of higher education. However, if there were ever any drug
use of any kind on the show, if there were a suicide, if there were
ever a moral lapse in a professor _ these things that are
automatically potential stories could somehow ruffle the feathers
of NYU.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, university officials would not say exactly what
concerned them about a show based on a pretty, talented freshman in
the big city for the first time. ``The script presented a kind of
context, environment that was not appropriate,'' said Richard Bing,
a spokesman for the university. ``The negatives kind of outweighed
the positives.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, NYU officials are thrilled to have the school name
used. Bing happily rattled off the series that have mentioned it in
recent years: ``Seinfeld'' (Kramer hires a student intern), ``The
Cosby Show'' (Theo, Malcolm-Jamal Warner's character, attends),
``The Nanny,'' ``Friends,'' ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ``NYPD
Blue.'' And ``Oh, Baby,'' the new Lifetime series about artificial
insemination, where the supervising doctor is at the NYU medical
school.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are borderline cases in both television and film,
as NYU's president, L. Jay Oliva, recalled. ``The first time I
remember was seeing `An American Werewolf in Paris,''' he said.
``The werewolf was in an NYU T-shirt. I thought, is this good or
bad?''
</P>
<P>
   It was not completely unprecedented. Oliva also recalls
``Manimal,'' a 1983 NBC series in which an NYU professor solved
crime by turning into the hirsute title character. (The series
lasted only three months.)
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, on-the-air mentions are regarded as free
product placement. Accordingly, Diane Fusilli, director of public
affairs at Sarah Lawrence College, was delighted when a
representative of ABC's sitcom ``Sabrina, the Teen-Age Witch''
called last season about an episode in which Sabrina was to attend
a college fair and linger over the Sarah Lawrence materials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fusilli said yes. ``If you think about `Sabrina, the
Teen-Age Witch,' that's a very popular show,'' she said. ``The
woman who plays Sabrina the witch, Melissa Hart, is a
well-respected actress. So it's not a bad place to be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If having a witch consider enrolling in Sarah Lawrence is a good
thing, what would be a bad thing?
</P>
<P>
   A doofus.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a school that recruits and graduates, you know, respected
sort of intellects,'' Ms. Fusilli said, ``if your character was
just exceedingly goofy and unsuccessful, in some ways it just
doesn't fit right. Not because it's going to ruin your reputation,
but you're sort of responsible for being the standard-bearer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it is a tough call. Bing remembered one particular
character on ``NYPD Blue'' with an NYU affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess if I had my druthers,'' Bing said, ``he wouldn't have
been the principal person under investigation. But for every
negative, there are three positives.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one positive came later that season when the star of
the same series, Detective Andy Sipowicz (played by Dennis Franz)
had surgery at NYU/Tisch Hospital. Everything turned out fine.

COMETS RETAIN WNBA TITLE BY BEATING MERCURY, 80-71 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   HOUSTON _ So much for Cheryl Miller's prediction of an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Although Miller got the dogfight she wanted, the Houston Comets,
behind two-time league MVP Cynthia Cooper, won their second
consecutive Women's National Basketball Association title Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   With a sellout crowd of 16,285 at Compaq Center, the Comets
shook loose of the Mercury in the closing minutes to ease to a
80-71 victory.
</P>
<P>
   The game lived up to its billing, with Cooper, Tina Thompson and
Sheryl Swoopes leading the Comets, but it was the tiny point guard
Kim Perrot, who made certain Houston would repeat. Perrot broke
open a 1-point game with a jumper. Then Swoopes took over.
</P>
<P>
   With Houston leading by 64-61, Swoopes stole the ball and fed
Thompson, who fed Janeth Arcain for a basket with 6 minutes 44
seconds left. Swoopes added a fast-break layup to make it 68-61 and
Houston eased to a 71-65 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arcain added the exclamation point with 2 minutes 20 seconds
left when Cooper fed her underneath for a 73-67 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, the league's two-time most valuable player, led her team
with 23 points while Thompson had 18 and Swoopes 16. Michelle
Griffiths was tops for Phoenix and the game with 24 points on
10-for-16 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury won Game 1 in Phoenix, then Houston came from 12
shots back in Game 2 to win 74-69 in overtime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Houston led 62-61 with 7:22 left, but couldn't seem to shake the
Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix erased a 6-point Houston lead, 32-26, at halftime and
took its first lead of the game, 41-39 with 16:49 left in the game.
Gillom tied the game at 39-39 with a jumper, then, after Perrot
blew a layup, Umeki Webb scored to put Phoenix up by two.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson popped for a pair of three-pointers to send Houston
ahead once again, 45-41, but the Mercury came right back and tied
it up again. This time, it was Perrot who broke the tie with a
3-pointer from the left side to give Houston a 50-47 lead with
13:18. After her team pulled back within one, Miller was called for
a technical during a timeout and Houston led, 53-51.
</P>
<P>
   Despite seven first-half turnovers, the Comets threatened to
blow the game wide open in the first half as they jumped to leads
of 10 and nine points early before heading into half time up 32-26.
But the lead was none too comfortable, especially since Cooper, who
had 13 points in the first half, picked up her third foul with 26.4
seconds left in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
   After Jennifer Gillom, who finished with 20 points, missed a
jumper, a scramble ensued for the rebound and Cooper, who had just
hit two free throws to give Houston a 30-23 lead, got caught
underneath just as Michelle Griffiths put up a desperation jumper.
It was good and that, plus the free throw, pulled the Mercury to
within six.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets set the tempo at the start with Swoopes nailing a
three-pointer 10 seconds into the game. Cooper followed it up,
driving the baseline for two and Perrot added a fast-break layup to
give Houston a 7-4 lead and the early momentum. To try and counter
the Comets, Miller went to a big lineup, but Chancellor countered
with one of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Then, leading by 10-7 after Cooper drove the lane and added a
free throw, the Comets went on a 15-8 run.  &QL;

DEMOCRATS FOR N.Y. SENATE SEEKING OUT SAFE GROUND
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK - With the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate still a
race in search of some sizzle, Rep. Charles Schumer focused on a
trademark issue Tuesday, proposing anti-crime measures to stem
illegal interstate gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   He did not cross paths with his principal opponents _ Geraldine
Ferraro and Mark Green _ but all three stuck to familiar and
relatively safe Democratic ground.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro picked up the endorsement of two gay Democratic clubs,
using the occasion to stress her commitment to civil rights and
nondiscrimination. Green, the New York City public advocate, went
to Harlem to call for a nationwide expansion of the city's Beacon
School program of after-school activities and vocational training.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, speaking at New York University, returned to a favorite
topic with his address on crime fighting. On the national and local
levels, crime still ranks as one of the top issues of public
concern, and polls have shown broad support for the federal ban on
assault weapons and the waiting period for handgun purchases, laws
that Schumer helped write and pass in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, a former U.S. representative from Queens, and Green are
also strong supporters of gun control, while their ultimate quarry,
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, has opposed such legislation in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's crime speech, which his aides billed as a major
address, wove together two of his principal campaign pitches: that
he has a proven record of legislation and a wealth of new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in 1994, as chairman of a House subcommittee on
crime, he was able to achieve bipartisan agreement on a major crime
bill by moving beyond ideological arguments and focusing on
measures that had been shown to work on the local level, like
increasing the number of police officers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how difficult it is to move legislation through
Congress,'' he added. ``I know about inertia.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 1994 crime bill, which was passed when the House of
Representatives was controlled by Democrats, could use an update.
He suggested changes in the juvenile court system to give judges
more flexibility in punishing youngsters convicted of minor crimes.
In response to a question from a reporter, he said he might support
some decriminalization of marijuana, especially to allow use of the
drug for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, he would like to increase the
penalties for illegal interstate sales of handguns and to restrict
the number of guns one person can buy in a month. The goal is to
crack down on the ``monsters'' who buy carloads of guns in states
like Florida, where gun control laws are relatively weak, and sell
them to criminals in New York, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Schumer's language is dramatic, his gun proposals are
not entirely new. And they are not a top priority for some groups
that have supported his anti-crime measures in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good deal of debate as to whether those big-time
gunrunners really exist,'' said Jim Pasco, executive director of
the Fraternal Order of Police in Washington. ``I agree that a
significant number of the weapons used in crimes in major
metropolitan areas were purchased in states with weaker laws. But
they are not purchased by the hundreds or thousands, but by
small-time entrepreneurs who may do 10 or 15 at a time. There is no
Al Capone out there moving guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro appeared at City Hall with supporters from two
Manhattan-based gay and lesbian groups _ the Millennium Triangle
Democratic Club and the Pride Democrats _ and proclaimed her
support for national legislation currently under consideration that
would ban employment discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will also be there seeking to get some sort of recognition
of domestic partners,'' she said. ``We'll move to make sure that
where there is discrimination, discrimination is ended.'' Green and
Schumer have been endorsed by some gay groups.
</P>
<P>
   While Ferraro said she supported federal legislation that would
guarantee employment-related benefits to domestic partners without
regard to sexual orientation, she opposed the formal recognition of
gay marriages. She said that was an issue for states, not the
federal government, to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who has criticized the lack of child care for single
mothers in New York, endorsed after-school programs during an
appearance with former Mayor David Dinkins at the playground of
Intermediate School 88 in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Beacon School program, which Dinkins established,
was a success that should be copied nationwide, a proposal he
acknowledged would cost about $3 billion a year. ``If it works here
in Harlem,'' he said, ``it can work in every school district in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Green said the money could come from a tax on cigarettes and
savings from cutbacks in programs for ``weapons that don't work
against enemies that don't exist.''

HOUSTON COMETS REPEAT AS CHAMPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL MURPHY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Raise the roof, baby.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the folks who run Compaq Center will have to do to
accommodate the steadily growing number of banners the Houston
Comets and Houston Rockets are accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets added banner No. 2, matching the total the Rockets
have collected, with an 80-71 victory over the Phoenix Mercury on
Tuesday night in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals. But the Comets did it
much faster than the stodgy old Rockets, winning their second
straight championship after taking the WNBA's inaugural title last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This could get to be a habit.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the fans are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the roof, which is what league Most Valuable Player
Cynthia Cooper's trademark arm-pumping, palms-to-the-skies gesture
signifies, is exactly what the 16,285 fans who packed Compaq Center
seemed intent on doing, creating an explosion of deafening noise
that threatened to blow the roof off the house.
</P>
<P>
   And it seemed as though every member of that crowd, which
included NBA players David Robinson, Sam Cassell, Avery Johnson,
Nick Van Exel, Mario Elie, Mark Bryant and Emanual Davis, was still
around long after the final buzzer sounded, singing, chanting,
dancing and waving homemade signs in a blizzard of red, white and
blue confetti cascading from the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   While the trophy-presentation platform was being assembled on
the court, players leaped on the press table and danced while
Comets coach Van Chancellor paraded around, embracing his
1-year-old nephew, Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   The championship was a fitting end for a team that set all kinds
of league records, the most amazing of which was winning 90 percent
of its regular-season games, finishing an astounding 27-3. Success
like that leads to raised expectations, which often derails a
team's championship drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the Comets seem to thrive on such pressure, as they
illustrated again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While it was a storybook-ending for the Comets, it was a
disappointing finish for the Mercury, who came oh, so close to the
title Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller had predicted for her team.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the Comets were intent on raising another banner,
Miller raised eyebrows by predicting _ during the regular season,
mind you _ that her Mercury would not only win the WNBA title, but
beat the Comets in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The last time anybody made a playoff prediction that audacious,
it was Moses Malone uttering his now-famous ``Fo', fo', fo',''
prediction for his 1983 Philadelphia 76ers, meaning three straight
four-game sweeps to the title. It turned out Malone was just one
game off, as was Miller's prediction.
</P>
<P>
   It would have made a great story, especially when the Mercury
had to win its last four regular-season games just to make the
playoffs, and then had to go three games to knock off stubborn
Cleveland, winning the final game on the road. The Mercury then
beat Houston in Game 1 at America West Arena, leaving Phoenix one
game away from fulfilling Miller's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the been-there, done-that Comets who quietly went to
work, rebounding from that Game 1 loss by rallying for a clutch
five-point overtime victory in Saturday's second game.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Comets in the same situation they faced last
season _ one game to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   Those are odds the Comets love.
</P>
<P>
   You could have predicted what was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets came out and set the tone immediately, getting an
NBA-distance 3-pointer from Sheryl Swoopes just nine seconds into
the game. But their second title wasn't going to be that easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets were up to the task, however, making the plays down
the stretch, when championships are won _ outscoring the Mercury
18-10 in the final 7:22.
</P>
<P>
   And when the buzzer sounded, it was time to celebrate. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the roof. They're running out of room in the building as
it is now.

TYSON'S BEHAVIOR IN TRAFFIC MISHAP COULD HURT LICENSE BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Nev.)   (bl)

   A traffic accident in a Maryland suburb near Washington on
Monday has created potential problems for Mike Tyson and could
negatively affect his appeal to the Nevada State Athletic
Commission to restore his boxing license.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was a passenger in a car driven by his wife, Monica, in
Gaithersburg, Md., on Monday that was involved in a three-car
chain-reaction accident. Tyson got into an argument with two men
involved in the accident. According to police, witnesses said Tyson
punched one man in the chest and kicked one man in the groin and
had to be restrained by his wife and bodyguards, who were following
in another car.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada commission member James Nave said the panel would want to
look at the incident when it considers Tyson's application for a
license during a Sept. 19 hearing in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigating the accident are calling the incident a
misdemeanor assault and say it is up to the two men involved to
bring charges against Tyson, who was not arrested. During
questioning by police, Tyson complained of chest pains and later
went to an emergency room, where he was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the latest incident of the former heavyweight
champion's exhibiting a loss of control that could hinder his
chances to box again soon. During a hearing on a license
application before the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board in
July, Tyson grew angry after questioning and uttered an expletive
as his lawyer was making a closing statement on his behalf. Tyson
later withdrew his application and applied to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada officials revoked Tyson's license after he bit the ears
of Evander Holyfield during their title bout on June 28, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe it's the days of isolation in training camp, but
lightweight title contender Angel Manfredy (24-2-1) is developing a
big superiority complex. During a telephone press conference
promoting his Sept. 22 bout against John Brown (18-4), Manfredy
declared himself the best junior lightweight and lightweight
fighter in the game; said he softened up Arturo Gatti for Ivan
Robinson and believes Prince Naseem Hamed is ducking him.
</P>
<P>
   As for Brown, Manfredy gave him little chance of winning their
bout. ``He's a short, tough kid, but he doesn't bring enough to the
table to do anything,'' Manfredy said. ``I'm going to explode on
him. I won't say it's a mismatch, but right now nobody at my weight
class can stop me.''

OLD WAGE PLAN FOR N.Y. CABBIES GETS ANOTHER LOOK
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By ANDY NEWMAN  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taxi executives, fearful that the city wants to
modify or eliminate the cab-leasing system that has become an
economic linchpin of the industry, proposed a pilot program Tuesday
under which 100 cabbies would work on commission, as most did until
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders say that leasing _ a policy that transformed
cabbies from fleet employees into independent contractors who pay
up to $110 a shift for use of a car _ brought the taxi business
back from the brink of disaster. But many drivers have complained
that leasing, which was legalized in 1979, has led drivers to work
longer hours for lower wages. The system has also been cited
frequently in recent months as contributing to reckless driving and
an increase in accidents during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The taxi executives said that their pilot program, suggested at
a Taxi and Limousine Commission hearing on the leasing system,
would be an attempt to make sure that if changes were made, they
were done on the basis of objective research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in '79, when we ran a commission garage, we were going
out of business,'' said Ron Sherman, the president of the
Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents big fleet
owners. ``We need current statistical data to see if the system
could work today. If it will work, we're not opposed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairwoman of the agency, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, has
refused to say what changes, if any, she is seeking in the leasing
system. She said she called the hearing simply to learn more about
how leasing was working and whether it was the best way to keep
good drivers in the industry. But most of her questions at the
hearing focused on the relative merits of the leasing and
commission systems.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman's group and the New York City Committee on Taxi Safety,
a group of medallion brokers, proposed operating a garage on the
commission system, in cooperation with the Taxi and Limousine
Commission, for two years, and comparing the drivers' income and
safety records with those of drivers working under the leasing
system.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the taxi agency were surprised by the proposal and
some seemed eager to hear more about it. But McGrath-McKechnie was
skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``My immediate response would be, why are you doing that and
what do you hope to accomplish, and why now?'' she said after the
hearing. But she added that the agency would consider all
suggestions carefully before taking any action.
</P>
<P>
   Under the pre-1979 system based on commissions, most drivers who
did not own medallions split their fares with fleet owners almost
50-50 and received health insurance and other benefits. But during
the 1970s, fleets began to run into financial trouble, in part,
they said, because cabbies often stole from them by doing business
off the meter and pocketing the entire fare.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators legalized leasing in 1979 as an alternative to
granting a fare increase. Owners embraced it because it gave them a
guaranteed income from the lease payments and cut administrative
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, most major cities have adopted the leasing system.
But critics have maintained for years that leasing unfairly shifts
the financial risk of operating a cab to the driver and has
enriched fleet owners and medallion brokers at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 study, two former New York City taxi regulators
reported that in 1981, when most fleet drivers still worked on
commission, the average fleet driver worked a nine-hour shift and
earned $55 in cash and $21 in benefits. By 1986, when most drivers
leased their cabs, the average driver worked a 12-hour shift and
made $64 in cash and $3 in benefits _ a 23 percent drop in total
compensation per hour, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the authors found, the average cab owner's profit
per shift rose to $57 for 12 hours in 1986, from $33 for 9 hours in
1981, a 30 percent increase in profit per hour.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over leasing is hardly open-and-shut. Some fleet
owners say that drivers earn more by leasing than under the
commission system, and that a driver with a leased car is more
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the dozen or so drivers who testified Tuesday, in fact,
said that they had worked under both systems and preferred leasing
because it gave them greater flexibility with their schedules and
rewarded them for working harder.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath-McKechnie, though, was hesitant to take their words at
face value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the drivers we heard from,'' she said, ``their bosses
were sitting in this room. I'm not sure how independently and
freely they thought that they could speak. We'll have to speak to
them on their own.''

<P>
   KOTZEBUE, Alaska _ Martha Wroe made up her mind years ago that
there were two things she would never do when she got old. ``I was
not going to be one of those old ladies clutching their purses to
them wherever they went,'' she said. Nor was she going to be the
sort of traveler who viewed the world from the safety of a cruise
ship.
</P>
<P>
   Which was why, three weeks shy of her 77th birthday, Ms. Wroe
was bracing herself against the wind as she made her way across a
stretch of rain-soaked tundra on Alaska's northwest coast, 26 miles
above the Arctic Circle, wearing a fanny pack. This old lady had
left her purse behind, in Gainesville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted an adventure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So did her fellow travelers, 13 other older men and women on a
weeklong journey with Elderhostel, the nonprofit organization that
arranges affordable, educational trips for people 55 and over.
</P>
<P>
   Bypassing the more traditional, less physically challenging
Elderhostel experience _ studying the Civil War in New Orleans,
say, or Mozart's operas in the Berkshires _ they had left a world
of comfort and ease to sit by the sea at the margins of the
continent, pick salmon out of a net and bask in the light of the
midnight sun.
</P>
<P>
   As exhilarating as all that was, though, they were also on a
journey that extended beyond geography and scenery. At a time in
their lives when their hair was turning gray, they were traveling
from a culture that worships youth and denies age to one that
reveres its elders. Among the Inupiat Eskimos, who make up most of
the population here, there are no senior citizens, no elderly, only
elders. This is a place where old age is an achievement. Elders are
to be respected. A highlight of the week was meeting Alaska natives
who had survived 60, 70 and 80 winters on this desolate strip of
land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my gray hair and wrinkles,'' said Beulah Commack,
an Inupiaq Eskimo elder nearing 70 who was the camp cook. ``God
made me this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Many things happened in this week. Men and women who did not
know each other shared meals, jokes, stories and secrets _ and the
outhouse at the primitive fish camp that was their home base. No
one talked much about the jobs or titles they had once held. These
were people living in the present, looking ahead and thinking about
what they wanted to do with the time they had left.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Field, 68, from Tucson, Ariz., who volunteered for outhouse
duty, had been a radiologist in Maine. He had loved practicing
medicine, and retired with difficulty, but ``I've fallen in love
with my wife all over again,'' he said. His wife of 45 years, Ann,
64, had retired as an oncology social worker, but what she had
always wanted to be, what she now had the time to be, in a way, was
an anthropologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``You move on,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to see a walrus head?''
</P>
<P>
   Maryann Mendenhall, a 69-year-old Inupiaq, had already told her
Elderhostel visitors about the time she killed a polar bear. She
had told them about toughing out winter in the days before
electricity and snowmobiles. The visitors in her living room
definitely wanted to see the walrus head.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mendenhall disappeared into the back of her house and
returned dragging the huge skull of a walrus she had bagged some
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I try lifting it?'' asked Ms. Wroe, a retired clinical
director of physical therapy at the University of Florida. It was
heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Even if she were not a noted hunter, Mrs. Mendenhall would be an
elder by virtue of her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you survived one year here, you could understand what it is
to survive 70 years,'' said Ruth Sampson, 43, an Inupiaq who talked
about the elders with the Elderhostel travelers. ``Whether you're
an Eskimo or white, you sure do command respect for your ability to
survive winter in this cold and unfriendly environment.''
</P>
<P>
   As for death, like the endless winters, it is faced
unblinkingly. In Kotzebue, the cemetery is next to the playground.
``When your time comes, your time comes,'' Mrs. Sampson said,
quoting an elder she knows. ``You can't go over it, beside it or
under it. You have to go through it.''
</P>
<P>
   All the Elderhostel travelers had to survive was one week in
mid-August. There are no roads into Kotzebue. Landing at the
airport, they were met by a broken-down yellow bus with a cracked
windshield, taped-up steering wheel and seats that slid off their
frames around every bend in the unpaved road.
</P>
<P>
   Six miles out of town, they came to a narrow strip of gravel
beach with a jumble of drafty cabins, salmon cutting sheds, caribou
bones and a couple of outhouses. On one side was Kotzebue Sound,
feeding into the Chukchi Sea. On the other was tundra. Down the
beach was a dead walrus. This was LaVonne's Fish Camp. LaVonne
Hendricks, a commercial fisherwoman and former public health nurse,
was their trip director.
</P>
<P>
   All was far from ready. One cabin was empty, without a stick of
furniture. A blackboard listing the day's chores included ``Make
Beds.'' A handyman eventually showed up with a hammer, nails and
wood and made two beds. It would be a metaphor for the
improvisational nature of the week. There was no schedule, Ms.
Hendricks told them, ``only possibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh my God, what have I done!''' Ms. Wroe confided
that evening, over group cocktails _ cheap wine poured from a
cardboard box. The friend she had persuaded to join her, Claudette
Finley, 59, had wondered the same thing. ``I thought, `I'm going to
kill Martha Wroe,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state of the fish camp turned out to be an excellent
icebreaker. Chuck and Martha Willis, from Dayton, Ohio, said they
had broken their rule for Elderhostel trips. ``We only look at the
ones that have private baths,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over dinner _ caribou soup and chum salmon, just caught _ the
talk of Elderhostel trips taken continued. Dick and Ann Field were
on their eighth; they had watched whales off Baja California,
explored Native American culture at a Hopi reservation, dabbled in
alternative healing in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   From a handful of offerings at New England colleges with 240
participants 20 years ago, Elderhostel has grown so that its
catalog lists 10,000 programs that are attended by more than
300,000 people a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Harris, 61, from Salem, Ore., who had just retired from
nursing, had come with her cousin, Dorothy Parrott, 64, from
Eugene. Mrs. Harris' husband, Ed, died seven years ago. Mrs.
Parrott's husband, Glenn, died of a heart attack a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parrott was doing the dinner dishes on a table outside with
two other women. ``Glenn died the day after my birthday,'' Mrs.
Parrott said. ``It's like I've been cut, and a part of me is
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   She pulled down the neck of her sweatshirt to reveal a tattoo,
of a broken heart. ``I got this six months after my husband died,''
she said. The women clasped her arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Elderhostel travelers were to spend the week meeting Inupiat
elders and experiencing their traditional way of living off the
land and sea. That meant, for starters, going out on a boat to pick
salmon off the net, then gutting it, drying it on racks and smoking
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everyone to have a direct relationship with a fish,''
Ms. Hendricks announced the first night.
</P>
<P>
   Willis, a foundation executive, whispered to his wife, a retired
nurse, that he was not going to touch any fish. Hours later, near
midnight but with plenty of daylight left, he was on a boat near
shore, up to his elbows in salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The second day it rained. The group went on a tundra walk
anyway. The tundra, a carpet of blueberries, crowberries, dwarf
birches and wildflowers over a layer of permafrost, is spongy and
difficult to walk on even when rain has not dotted it with
knee-deep puddles.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Wroe quickly fell behind, a small figure in an oversized
yellow rain suit. The others kept stopping to see if she needed
help, but she waved them on. Once or twice she fell. But eventually
she caught up, at a lake where the group was watching a pair of
Arctic loons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck by the tundra,'' Field said during a group
discussion the morning after the walk. ``I could have spent a
couple of hours up there on my hands and knees,'' Mrs. Field added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loons were spectacular,'' said Bernice LaPorte, 66, who
was on the trip from northern Maine with her husband, George. ``And
the yellow canary.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone gave a cheer for the canary. Later, Ms. Wroe said, ``I
wanted to make it. I was thinking, what a thrill, here I am above
the Arctic Circle, and I may never do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   As the week went on, the group met more Inupiat, at the fish
camp or in their homes. The elders all had thoroughly modern
bathrooms, the use of which they offered to their grateful
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Growing older in a changing world, the elders from the lower 48
and those from the Arctic discovered they were dealing with many of
the same things.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Norton, an 85-year-old elder just back from three days of
camping on the tundra to pick berries, complained that she had
recently acquired a new house in town but her husband was refusing
to move.
</P>
<P>
   The Fields understood the conflict. Field would have liked to
stay in Maine in retirement, but the Arizona climate was better for
his wife's arthritis. ``It was my turn to follow her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We left a community where we were somebodies,'' Mrs. Field
said. ``Then you move to this large community where nobody knows
who you are. It's humbling. It's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   And George LaPorte, a retired dentist who is an avid hunter and
fisherman, knew how Mrs. Norton felt when she told the group, ``I
still feel young.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I'm 69,'' LaPorte said, flipping hamburgers on
the grill one evening. ``I can't believe I'm going to be 70.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Commack, the camp cook, was moved hearing Mrs. Parrott talk
about her late husband. Mrs. Commack's husband died three years
ago. ``I still miss my old man,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Elderhostel travelers worry about losing touch
with younger people, the Inupiat in many cases face a greater
divide. Their way of life has been sharply eroded over the last
half-century by everything from missionaries to television to the
tourists they were now entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children don't speak Eskimo,'' Mrs. Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the commonalities, the Elderhostel visitors were all
too aware of how different it was to be old in the lower 48. ``I'm
just starting to get this subtle feeling that I'm not as visible as
I used to be,'' said Martha Willis, who is 62. ``I'm getting a
little less eye contact from the young, a little less
consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to embrace the word elder,'' she said toward the end
of the week. ``I like it better than senior citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   What does it mean to be a senior citizen, anyway? ``In the lower
48 it means getting discounts and things like that,'' Lois Harris
said during a group discussion. ``Here, it means self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather itself was a test. It rained hard for five days. The
waves reached the outhouse door. ``My kids told me, `Mom, get a new
life,''' Mrs. Parrott said as the bus forded the flooded road on
the way to town one day. She laughed. ``I'm not sure this is what
they meant.''
</P>
<P>
   The sun reappeared on the last evening. Mrs. Parrott and Mrs.
Harris dipped their feet in the Chukchi Sea.
</P>
<P>
   At a closing ceremony around the dinner table, everyone talked
about what they would take away.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Harris told the group, ``This will help me with the journey
I'm on. I'm 61, I'm still young. What am I going to do with the
time I have left? What meaning can I find?''

POLICE, DISGUISED AS DINERS, CATCH FUGITIVE AFTER SHOOTOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ In a huge undercover sting that involved
state troopers posing as diners at a service plaza on the New
Jersey Turnpike, FBI agents and troopers exchanged gunfire with a
heavily armed fugitive Tuesday before charging him with shooting a
Camden police officer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The state police closed down the turnpike at about 8:40 a.m.
after receiving a tip that Charles Rodriguez was expected to enter
the public rest area through a rear service drive at 9 a.m.
Rodriguez had been sought on an attempted murder warrant since the
shooting of a Camden County park police officer, Stephen Leoniy
III, in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers herded employees and patrons into a restroom to shield
them from a possible shooting, then assigned undercover officers to
walk around the station so it didn't look suspiciously empty, said
FBI spokeswoman Linda Vizi.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rodriguez, his brother, Joseph, and two other men drove
up the rest stop's rear service drive in a stolen sedan shortly
before 9 a.m., officials said. The four were wearing bulletproof
vests and carrying a half dozen high-powered weapons, including an
AK-47 and an M-16.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Conforti, the FBI agent in charge of the Philadelphia
office, said that when agents in FBI raid jackets approached the
car, Rodriguez and his companions opened fire, starting a furious
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew who they were shooting at,'' Conforti said, ``It was
obvious that he was looking for a gunfight. He was loaded for
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Employees and drivers who had been ordered into the restroom by
the police huddled on the floor as they heard the sounds of
repeated gunfire and shattering glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was freaked out, that's for sure,'' said Rafael Rivera, who
had dropped his wife off at her cashier's job at the plaza shortly
before the sting began and was ordered into the restroom by the
state police.
</P>
<P>
   The police would not say how many shots were fired. After
intense firing from both sides, the Rodriguezes and their two
accomplices surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   There were no major injuries. One trooper was cut by flying
glass; Joseph Rodriguez was grazed in the hip by a bullet, and was
treated at a hospital and released into police custody by late
afternoon, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rodriguez was arraigned in federal District Court in
Camden and charged with attempted murder of the police officer and
weapons charges. Joseph Rodriguez and the two other suspects,
Joseph Sotto and Fernando Flores, were each charged with federal
firearms violations, Conforti said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Charles Rodriguez, 31, of Camden, was featured on a segment of
the television crime-solving program ``America's Most Wanted'' on
Sept. 20, 1997. Ms. Vizi, the FBI spokeswoman, said the tip was not
generated by the television program, but declined to say where it
came from or whether Rodriguez had been going to rob the rest
stop's restaurant or gas station.
</P>
<P>
   The sting operation, which involved more than 90 federal agents
and state troopers, ended a frustrating 18-month manhunt. The FBI
became involved when there were reports that Rodriguez was in
another state.
</P>
<P>
   Leoniy was driving in his patrol car near a high school in
Camden on Feb. 12, 1997, when he heard gunfire and saw a suspected
stolen car. He approached the vehicle, saw the flash from a weapon
and took cover in his car. But the gunman fired 15 more rounds, and
Leoniy was struck in both eyes by fragments from a bullet that
apparently shattered on a windshield wiper blade.
</P>
<P>
   Leoniy underwent surgery to remove the the bullet shards, and
recovered his sight. He has returned to the force.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice before, police staked out a home where Charles
Rodriguez was expected to appear, but he never arrived. But when
the authorities received the tip about Rodriguez's impending visit
to the Walt Whitman rest stop, it had enough specific details that
they decided to try again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted him bad, real bad,'' said Camden County Prosecutor
Lee Solomon. ``We're glad we got him.''

DAVID PATERSON: STRADDLING A LINE BETWEEN POLITICAL WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whatever this weekend's Million Youth March turns out
to be _ a peaceable protest, a thunderhead of rage and malevolence,
a forgettable fizzle _it will take place on David Paterson's
doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   In its pride and its anger, most of Harlem eventually passes by
his family's apartment near 132nd Street and Malcolm X Boulevard,
and as the area's state senator and scion of one of its most
prominent families, Paterson has viewed the march foremost as a
neighborhood tumult, almost a personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   While others focus on the virulence of the march's organizer,
Khalid Abdul Muhammad, Paterson has been more concerned about the
neighbors and constituents whose children will be drawn to the
event, whose sidewalks will be overrun, whose images will be
broadcast for the delectation of the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   And so he has tried to be a broker amid the publicity churn,
dispensing with Muhammad as a destructive hater while urging City
Hall to recognize the concerns of the marchers and tone down the
condemnations in the interest of public safety.
</P>
<P>
   For this, he has earned the disdain of Muhammad and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, both of whom have accused him and other elected
leaders of equivocating instead of taking a strong stand for or
against the march. But he gently rejects the idea that one must
take such doctrinaire positions, preferring a nuanced approach born
not just of political necessity but also of singular experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of some of the problems I've had in my life, I think
it's given me a unique perspective, a different way of looking at
the world than other people,'' he said. ``I think that's why I can
condemn the hate language associated with the rally, but understand
the anger and the disenfranchised feeling that makes
African-Americans unable to denounce a person who's doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   His personal prism, he says, is the result of being the son of
Basil Paterson, the former state senator and deputy mayor, while
feeling inadequate to enter his father's elite political world
because he was born with no sight in his left eye and severely
limited vision in his right. Even as he struggled to overcome those
feelings, he found himself repelled by the racism he saw among some
advocates for the disabled, and by the bias among black leaders
against people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   And so he moves between worlds, understanding but not
subscribing to anyone's orthodoxy, freely taking positions
unthinkable to his father's generation but never fully straying
from the insider's political path.
</P>
<P>
   Though a political product of the city's mainline Democratic
organization, Paterson, 44, says his party's inflexibility and lack
of creativity have driven away vast constituencies. He is starting
to see the merit in such ideas as charter schools and voucher
systems. And as much as he criticizes Giuliani for raising the
temperature of the march and failing to address the longstanding
concerns of black residents, he praises the mayor for his law
enforcement achievements and for the city's economic rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you criticize everything somebody does, and find a way to
diminish any achievement of another person or mayor, you
marginalize yourself,'' he said. ``The public believes you're just
reacting, that you've succumbed to anger or hostility based on
previous events. Whether I like the outcome of the mayoral election
in 1993, I was elected by my constituents to bring back the
greatest resources to my community. I will work with anybody,
because my community is under siege.''
</P>
<P>
   His flexibility and his thoughtful explanations of his political
positions have made him an important black leader, with influence
far beyond his essentially powerless position as a Democrat in the
Republican-controlled state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is very much a bridge between young people and his
father's generation, and that's something important that's been
missing in this city,'' said Bill Lynch, the former deputy mayor
and strategist, who was Mayor David Dinkins' longtime adviser. ``He
has the credibility among both groups to say things that other
people can't say, like challenging the messenger on this march
without looking like he's doing it under somebody's guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterson can see enough to play a decent game of basketball,
raise two children with his wife, Michelle, and make his way
without a cane. He entered politics after Hofstra Law School at the
urging of his father's friends, believing he had to pretend that
being legally blind was not an impediment, and until a few years
ago he could barely talk about his eyesight. But he finally decided
he was more comfortable admitting there were certain things he
could not do, joining the community of the disabled and even making
jokes on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Though he seems more comfortable within himself now, proud of
his role mediating various racially tinged disputes over the last
several years, he has yet to make the move that would propel him
into the first rank of the city's political leadership.
</P>
<P>
   He has twice tried to escape the deadening frustration of the
Senate, but for transitional jobs that he did not win: public
advocate in 1993, and Manhattan borough president last year. His
friends have urged him to go for something more substantive the
next time, and to begin organizing soon. He's thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you learn in my position,'' he said. ``You don't
evolve unless you take a chance.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: CLINTON LECTURES ON RUSSIA'S FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By ELEANOR RANDOLPH  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an Editorial Observer on Wednesday,
Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   With markets crashing, banks shuddering and the government
imploding, Russians may not feel the urgent need for a lecture from
President Clinton about economic reform. Despite the worthiness of
his message about how Russia must ultimately follow ``the
fundamental economic imperatives of the global market'' to
flourish, the president's talk Tuesday to young leaders in Moscow
still sounded a little like the rich man giving a pep talk to the
poor folk under the bridge: Yes, it's cold and gloomy down there, I
know, and yes, it's painful now, but I promise it will be better in
the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians have been waiting a long time for the long run.
During earlier decades, they endured Soviet five-year plans that
dangled impossible promises of the golden Communist banquet where
everyone would share more or less equally in the great national
harvest. As the Soviet center fell apart in 1991, the old system
gave way to a tender young democracy and an increasingly beastly
form of capitalism. Many young Russians I talked with as a Moscow
correspondent in those exuberant days saw a future where freedom
was somehow accompanied by a BMW, as if democracy and a fat wallet
would all arrive together in one lush Western package.
</P>
<P>
   Now, faced with a reality that is increasingly painful to
millions of people, Russia seems altogether too ready to decide
that the Western reforms _ at least as their leaders and their
shadow government of businessmen boyars practiced them _ were just
another faulty experiment. ``Stay the course?'' said the Harriman
Institute professor Steven Solnick of the president's advice. ``To
the extent they were on the course, they hate it. I think we need
to steel ourselves for a long period of anti-Americanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Into this whirlwind comes Clinton, suggesting grand needs for an
increasingly needy country. Fair tax laws and fair enforcement,
easier land transfers, intellectual property rights, independent
courts, strong banks, security markets that protect investors,
social spending that promotes hope and opportunity, a safety net
for the dislocated and vigilance against ``hidden ties between
government and business interests'' _ this was his list of lofty
goals for a better Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an American agenda,'' the president assured his
young audience. ``These are the imperatives of the global
marketplace. ...''
</P>
<P>
   These imperatives, as worthy as they are, did not even lead the
Russian nightly news a few hours later. The vacuum in the Kremlin,
the fear of government upheaval, the weakening ruble, the stores
with emptying shelves and the first day of school were more urgent
topics for most Russians trying to survive far beyond the latest
presidential summit. Seven years after the end of the Soviet era,
advice from a Westerner, especially an American president who
acknowledges that he is not leavening it with financial aid, is
hardly news.

BURTON ACCUSES CLINTON SUPPORTERS OF BEING BEHIND `SCANDAL STORY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to fix name of newspaper in 2nd graf) (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Dan Burton, whose committee has been
investigating fund-raising abuses in the re-election campaign of
President Clinton, said this week that a national magazine plans to
publish a ``scandal story'' about him at the behest of Clinton's
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   At town hall meetings in Indianapolis on Monday, the Indiana
Republican accused Clinton's supporters of spreading rumors about
his personal life in an effort to intimidate him. Burton, the
bombastic chairman of the Committee on Government Reform and
Oversight, warned voters that they should not be surprised to read
that he has had troubles in his 38-year marriage, said a published
account by the Indianapolis Star and News.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the magazine, Vanity Fair, and officials at
the White House and the Democratic National Committee scoffed at
Burton's accusations, calling them unfounded and saying that no
campaign exists to discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   While the magazine has been working on an article on Burton, it
has no link to the White House, said the spokeswoman for Vanity
Fair, Beth Kseniak. ``It's totally ridiculous to think that the
White House has anything to do with this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, where the talk is of impeachment hearings and
Monica Lewinsky, some believe Burton's assertions offer a hint of
foreshadowing, or perhaps foreboding. Reports have persisted that
personal peccadillos once considered nobody's business could soon
become everyone's business as members of Congress try to impugn or
defend Clinton's behavior in an expected House impeachment inquiry.
Minor transgressions, adulterous episodes, past tribulations could
all surface, or resurface, along with the specter of impeachment,
say aides, representatives and Congressional observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones,'' said
Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the ranking Democrat on Burton's
committee. ``I don't know how people will react about what they
know about themselves. I think that most members of Congress should
understand that the public is pretty outraged when they find
politicians who are hypocritical.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., who sits on the Judiciary Committee,
the panel with jurisdiction over an impeachment inquiry, said that
any effort at a smear campaign could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time, be it Republicans or Democrats, when you stoop into
the gutter to do that sort of thing, that is not good strategy,
that would turn people off,'' Coble said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Burton's accusation was the second time in a week that a public
official has accused Clinton's supporters of orchestrating a smear
campaign. Last week, Rep. Paul McHale, D-Penn., who called for
Clinton's resignation two weeks ago, was subject to false charges
about his military decorations.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation against McHale surfaced on the NBC program
``Geraldo Rivera'' on Thursday when Rivera, who has been a
persistent defender of Clinton, said he had received a call from
someone ``close to President Clinton'' with information that McHale
may have lied about his military honors. The charge was false, and
a White House official called McHale to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Tuesday, McHale said that he is
disturbed by the tactics that Clinton's supporters have used
against their enemies, a spillover, he said, from the 1992
presidential campaign's take-no-prisoners approach. ``Someone close
to the president leaked false information to Geraldo about me,''
said McHale. ``That has been a consistent and unfortunate theme
with this president, the use of anonymous leaks to damage, if not
shatter, another person's personal reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton has had a considerably rockier relationship with the
White House than McHale has had, at one point referring to Clinton
with a vulgarity. On Monday, Burton told his constituents that a
reporter for the magazine had been rooting around in his past,
interviewing as many as 200 friends, relatives and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Burton declined to answer specific questions about his marriage,
said news accounts in Indiana, but he volunteered: ``It's not
illegal, anything I've done. But my wife and I _ and I hate to tell
you this _ but my wife and I were separated three times in our
38-year marriage.'' Burton said that one point the two nearly
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I want to tell you: If something comes out, that you read
about, that you think Danny shouldn't have done, I will own up to
it. I won't lie about it. I will tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton was not available for comment Tuesday. But his staff
director, Kevin Binger, said the White House has been conducting a
``scorched earth'' campaign against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Burton's accusations that the White House was behind the
Vanity Fair article, Waxman said: ``If he has proof, he ought to
come forward with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Rahm Emanuel, a senior adviser to the
President, said Tuesday that while the White House has taken issue
with Burton's Congressional investigation, it has never criticized
Burton personally. ``We never have and never will talk about or
criticize him on personal matters,'' Emanuel said. ``Everybody's
personal life is exactly that _ private, personal and nobody's
business.''
</P>
<P>
   As House members prepare to return to Capitol Hill next week,
one House Republican aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said the Judiciary Committee had already received inquiring calls
about the personal lives of certain members.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
AUSTIN _ Before Ricky Williams chose to return to Texas for his
senior season and a presumed run at the Heisman Trophy, he sought
the opinion of, among others, former Tennessee quarterback Peyton
Manning.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Williams asked Manning about his experiences as college
football's most visible player, his thoughts on the decision
Williams then weighed. He asked if Manning had any regrets about
postponing and perhaps even risking his NFL windfall to play one
last season of college football.
</P>
<P>
   He did not ask, however, where Manning would put his 1997
Heisman. The award, assumed to belong to Manning the day he decided
to give college football another year, went instead to defensive
back Charles Woodson of national co-champion Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Williams saw the lesson of the Heisman. No award
can generate so much discussion before play even begins, yet few
can be as unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   No names appear on the ballot, and certainly there is no
official list of candidates now. But as college football heads into
its first full weekend of the season, the names of ``contenders''
are dropped more than Republican presidential possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is a Heisman Trophy candidate?'' asked Williams, last
season's national rushing and scoring leader, without really
expecting an answer. ``Isn't everyone a candidate?''
</P>
<P>
   Presumably anyone can become an award candidate based on
performance. But with publicity and name recognition so much a part
of a Heisman election, candidates are unofficially named in the
media long before the first game is played, then measured and
redefined from the season's first week.
</P>
<P>
   Like Manning a year ago, Williams has already been the subject
of lengthy stories in every newspaper and sports magazine that
covers college football on a national basis. He begins this season
289 yards short of breaking Earl Campbell's Texas career rushing
record and 1,928 yards shy of eclipsing Tony Dorsett's national
mark.
</P>
<P>
   But for Texas and Williams, the Heisman attention is unusual in
that it dwarfs expectations for the team's season. The Longhorns
believe they will do far better than last season's 4-7. But while
they speak of the Heisman openly, there is no talk of a run at a
national championship and little of contending for the Big 12
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more focus on Heisman than there is the football
team,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem to put all sorts of pressure on Williams, but he
said he hasn't felt any burden other than to help prevent a return
to last season's struggles. He said he doesn't need to pursue a
Heisman, logically reasoning that if he plays well enough for Texas
to have an outstanding season, his numbers will put him in
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been too overwhelming. It's no big deal,'' he said.
``It's what everyone wants when they come to a place like Texas.
They want to be the one in the spotlight. I won't look at it. If I
look at it or not, I still have to go out and perform every week.
If we win games, and I do what I'm supposed to do, the Heisman
stuff will come later.''
</P>
<P>
   But since it has already come now, Brown has spoken to Williams
individually and to the team as a whole. Williams, he said, should
not feel pressure to win the award, because it has become something
of a team accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   No player from a team with as many as two losses has won the
Heisman since Brigham Young's Ty Detmer in 1990. The past two
Heisman winners, Woodson and Florida's Danny Wuerffel, were on
their way to national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped him when we talked to the team and said, `You know,
this isn't a Ricky run for the Heisman. This is a team run for the
Heisman,''' Brown said. ``If our team doesn't play well, Ricky has
no chance to win the Heisman. We need to stop people on defense to
get the ball back. If we don't have the ball very much, he won't
get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the stat-machine stars no longer are guaranteed anything.
After the long run of running backs _ from Penn State's John
Cappelletti in 1973 to Nebraska's Mike Rozier in 1983 _ was broken,
there was a trend that favored record-setters Barry Sanders of
Oklahoma State, Andre Ware of Houston and Detmer.
</P>
<P>
   But the national-championship contenders _ Miami's Gino
Torretta, Florida State's Charlie Ward, Wuerffel, Woodson _ have
since taken over. Before Iowa State's Troy Davis, no running back
had rushed for 2,000 yards without winning a Heisman. Davis did it
twice. Texas Tech's Byron Hanspard surpassed 2,000 yards in 1996
and finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Even lifetime achievement can go unrewarded by the voters. Texas
A&AMP;M's Darren Lewis is the NCAA's fifth-leading rusher all-time but
the only member of the top five not to have won the Heisman. He
never finished in the top five in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   For Williams, the greater pressure might come from the
attention. Texas lost to UCLA 66-3 last season. But when the
Longhorns play at UCLA on Sept. 12, the game will be billed as a
Heisman showdown between Williams and Bruins quarterback Cade
McNown.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are talking about the Heisman Trophy everybody
watches everything he says and does and the steps he takes,'' Brown
said. ``Obviously, if he has a game where we're not moving the ball
as well as we should, and for him it's a subpar 100-yard game or
something, the headlines the next morning will be `Ricky out of the
Heisman.' That's the first thing that happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the position he is in, he's had interviews every day, along
with being as tired as he's ever been because he's worked as hard
as he ever has. There are stacks for him to sign every day in our
office. He got to the point he wouldn't come see me this summer
because there's 80 balls for him to sign. He wants to sign them,
but after the morning practice, when you're exhausted and somebody
grabs you and says sign 80 balls, it can be taxing.''
</P>
<P>
   While the media are eager to anoint Heisman candidates 12 months
a year, schools happily play along, advertising their ``Heisman
Trophy candidate'' on media guides and, in some cases, sending
promotional videos and posters even before the season begins.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, it is a worthwhile expense. Because the Heisman
is such a high-profile individual award, a campaign for it not only
rewards a current player but can send a message to recruits about
the ability of players from a given school to earn that level of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Texas sent out a Williams videotape last season, writing in the
accompanying letter that the team's poor season should not prevent
Williams from earning consideration. There have been no preseason
promotions. With the attendant publicity, a campaign would be
considered overkill and possibly bring a voter backlash.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no such reaction from teammates. Whether because
of Williams' ability, manner or decision to return, Texas players
said they don't mind being overshadowed by one player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what he can do,'' offensive tackle Jay Humphrey said.
``In the back of the offensive line's mind, we know Ricky's got a
chance to get the Heisman. That's in the back of our minds on every
play. We know we want to get him the Heisman. And if he does, I'd
go to New York with him to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   But given the lessons of Heisman favorites of the past, he might
not want to buy those tickets quite yet.

TOUGH FRANCHIONE GIVES TCU SENIORS ONE LAST HOPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As twilight began to overtake his TCU
football career, senior tailback Basil Mitchell gazed into the past
and didn't like what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Too much losing. In particular, a 1-and-10 eyesore was still
fresh in people's minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to go out, as seniors, on 1-10,'' Mitchell said
yesterday. ``We didn't want to leave that as our lasting memory.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mitchell and 14 other seniors, the chance for a season of
absolution is at hand. In the Horned Frogs' case, the long road
back from a near-winless season begins Saturday at Iowa State.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this will be no clash of the titans. As testimony to
former TCU athletic director Frank Windegger's scheduling prowess,
the Cyclones are also coming off a 1-10 campaign. In their first
six contests last season, Iowa State opponents ``averaged'' 49
points a game.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, meanwhile, saw the coming of a new coach at TCU as a
welcomed fresh start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a second chance to establish TCU as a program on the
rise,'' said the senior from Mount Pleasant. ``When this thing gets
turned around, we want to say that we started it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, therefore, more than welcomes the transition from
``Paranoia Pat'' Sullivan to confident, collected Dennis
Franchione. He doesn't mind the head coach's yelling. He doesn't
blink at the volume of conditioning work that the new staff has the
players perform.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new attitude at TCU _ the latest, regrettably, in a
continuing series. The Frogs seem energized that the slate has been
wiped clean. As far as their new coach is concerned, Basil Mitchell
is undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   Yell?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mind the yelling,'' senior linebacker Joseph Phipps
said, ``you're in the wrong sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The up-tempo clamor of the Frogs' workouts suggests that
Franchione and his staff were not enamored of the conditioning and
stamina of the team they inherited. As bodies flagged last season,
hearts seemed to follow.
</P>
<P>
   One play, often late in the game, would go against the '97
Frogs, and a Pandora's box of telling disasters seemed to
inevitably ensue. That script eventually became a metaphor for the
season.
</P>
<P>
   So let the new coach yell, Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's appropriate,'' he assessed. ``People might call
them little things, but they're the things that help build a
program. How we practice is how we'll perform in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs are three days away from their first game under
Franchione, and they're already starting to sound like the new
coach.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione is that persuasive. As he sat yesterday for his first
weekly media luncheon, Franchione suggested aloud that he might
even consider alternating quarterbacks Patrick Batteaux and Jeff
Dover after each play.
</P>
<P>
   And nobody burst into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought about it,'' the new coach repeated, without a
blink. ``I've thought about rotating them by plays so I could coach
between plays.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he saw it on TV last year. Apparently, some nut named
Spurrier was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches alternate their quarterbacks after each possession.
But as Franchione said, differing, ``I would be more apt to
alternate by plays, because I can almost coach him on what's going
to happen and how to handle it before I send him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the luncheon table, heads were nodding in enlightened
agreement. When you're a new coach, every utterance is sheer
genius.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can just look at his past and where he and his staff have
been,'' said linebacker Phipps. ``They've always had success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a vibe. You can just feel that vibe they send off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can feel that. People believe in that.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years at TCU, the vibe has, more often than not, been
just an echo bouncing off the empty stadium seats.
</P>
<P>
   This time, on a quiet summer day, the Frogs can hold their
breaths and hear an absolution.

 McGWIRE HOMERS TWICE TO BREAK NL RECORD  
(nk) 
 By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Twelve days after becoming the first player to hit at
least 50 home runs in three consecutive seasons, Mark McGwire set
another record Tuesday night by slugging his 56th and 57th home
runs, breaking Hack Wilson's 68-year-old National League mark for
home runs in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the seventh inning, McGwire hit a 450-foot homer to
center field against the Florida Marlins' Livan Hernandez on a 1-1
pitch. McGwire knew it was gone. He trotted out of the batter's box
and watched the ball sail halfway up a tarp behind the 404-foot
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Several boys scrambled for the souvenir as the crowd of 37,014
gave McGwire a standing ovation. He touched the plate with a big
grin and playfully punched teammate Ron Gant in the stomach before
returning to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning, more than a dozen youngsters gathered on
the tarp in anticipation of a homer _ and that is where McGwire hit
it again.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and none on, he hit the first pitch to him from
Donn Pall over the wall in center field, 472 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire received standing ovations and responded with curtain
calls in front of the dugout after each homer.
</P>
<P>
   He flied out, singled and grounded out in his first three
at-bats in the Cardinals' 7-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire began the night tied with the Chicago Cubs' Sammy Sosa
at 55 homers in their race to break Roger Maris' major league
record of 61 in a season.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday afternoon at Wrigley Field, Sosa predicted: ``Mark will
hit two tonight. Every time I catch him, bang, he jumps ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wrigley Field crowd gasped when McGwire's 57th was
announced. Even with the wind blowing out at Wrigley, Sosa was 0
for 4 with three strikeouts in the Cubs' 6-5 win over the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   The news media crush around Sosa doubled Tuesday, as 127
credentials were given out. Sosa took it in stride, showing the
reporters the Flintstone vitamins in his locker.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's National League home run record of 56 was set in 1930
for the Chicago Cubs. He also had 190 RBIs that season, still the
major league record. McGwire's latest homer gave him 120 RBI.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McGwire isn't all that eager to talk about his batting swing,
choosing not to share with even his own St. Louis teammates what
has turned him into the most productive home run hitter in baseball
the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In one brief moment of candor in mid-June, however, McGwire
acknowledged to a Sporting News reporter that releasing his top
hand after contact, to insure full bat extension, has made a
significant difference in his hitting consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Tony LaRussa, McGwire's manager, knew it all along. LaRussa
considers himself a disciple of Charley Lau, the hitting coach who
considered a top-hand release as one of the 10 absolutes of
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   And McGwire isn't the only one.
</P>
<P>
   LaRussa said that Sosa releases the top hand more than half the
time. And the next most productive home run hitter, Seattle's Ken
Griffey Jr. with 47, has long believed in the top-hand release.
</P>
<P>
   Lau died in 1984, revered for his work with such top hitters as
George Brett, Hal McRae and Reggie Jackson, but criticized for his
notion about releasing the top hand after contact to get maximum
bat extension, a radical notion at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us who are tremendous fans of Charley Lau know now
that he's up there smiling because there's a certain amount of
vindication for that style of hitting,'' LaRussa said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Boston Red Sox's Mo Vaughn has noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always been able to hit home runs,'' Vaughn said. ``But
now he's hitting the light towers.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire clearly understands how much more consistent power he
has now. His average home run this season has gone almost 422 feet,
with his longest traveling 545, also against Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back when I was a younger hitter and I knew I hit some
balls far,'' McGwire said Monday. ``But then I really didn't
understand what hitting is all about. Now I do.''
</P>
<P>
   LaRussa believes McGwire will break Maris' record, provided
pitchers don't dodge him and add to his major league-leading total
of 143 walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll finish it off _ mentally he'll finish it off,'' the
manager said. ``The question is the competition with the pitchers.
If they compete, he's got a great chance. If they stop competing,
they take the bat out of his hands.''

 &HT;    ZEDILLO DEFENDS BANK BAIL-OUT, ADMITS CORRUPTION HAS DAMAGED
MEXICO
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Facing a wobbling peso and one of the biggest bank
scandals in Mexico's history, President Ernesto Zedillo on Tuesday
defended his administration's economic policies but acknowledged
that white-collar crime and corruption has caused ``grave damage''
to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo offered his annual speech on Mexico's state of the union
Tuesday night after a tough week in Mexico. On Monday alone,
Mexico's stock market dropped 5 percent. Over the last year,
Mexico's peso has lost 27 percent of its value; most of that slide
has occurred over the last couple of weeks, coinciding with the
Russian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has also had to cut its federal budget three times this
year due to plummeting oil prices. Zedillo blamed the drop in oil
prices and the Asian and Russian economic crises for promoting a
climate of instability. In addition, he credited his
administration's economic policies for weathering the current
global economic storm better than other countries, and for
producing Mexico's highest economic growth rate -- 7 percent -- in
16 years, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Zedillo acknowledged mounting public pressure over solutions
he has proposed to resolve fallout from Mexico's 1994 economic
crisis -- primarily a highly controversial $65 billion bank
bail-out he is trying to push through a divided Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The bail-out would convert bank debts linked to the 1994 peso
crash -- and mismanagement -- to public debt. To salvage the
country's banking system, the administration assumed the debt with
long-term bonds and now wants to convert it to securities that can
be cashed in now.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans have reacted with outrage to the plan, especially since
opposition parties have provided evidence that corrupt bankers
suspected of stealing millions would benefit from the bail-out.
Another twist in the scandal are allegations that some businessmen
contributed loans they never repaid to election campaigns waged by
Zedillo's party, the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Mexicans voted overwhelmingly against Zedillo's
proposal in a non-binding referendum on the bail-out sponsored by
the left-center Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, opposition parties and Zedillo's own party have
presented alternative plans for the bailout, some of which include
forcing the wealthiest of Mexico's businesses to pay their own
debts.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, Zedillo defended his administration's decision to
prop up the country's banking system by taking over banks'
outstanding debts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bankruptcy of the banking and payment system would have
paralyzed Mexico's entire economy,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My duty was to act decisively to confront the emergency. I did
so and I will never regret doing so, just as I do not regret, but
rather applaud with unwavering democratic conviction, the fact that
the government's actions are subject to debate.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Zedillo said, it is ``outrageous that a substantial
part of the breakdown of the banking system is the result, in some
cases of negligence, and in others of fraudulent acts on the part
of certain bank administrators, executives and stockholders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those individuals . . . ,'' he said, ``wronged depositors . .
. and above all the Mexican people.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo said Mexico's current laws to prevent white-collar crime
are ``absurdly lenient'' and he invited Congress to reform them.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo also touched on Mexico's current crime wave, admitting
that all branches of government ``have failed our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will propose tougher crime penalties, an elimination
of the right to release on bail in cases of dangerous crimes and
measures to crack down on corrupt police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens are rightfully demanding laws that protect
them,'' he said. ``Public security is something the state owes to
its citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He called corrupt police ``the cruelest and most dangerous
criminals because they act with impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition party speakers who preceded Zedillo challenged his
attempts to present a rosy picture of Mexico's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a political economy that cancels opportunities for
well-paid jobs, it's no wonder that undocumented workers continue
losing their lives -- 100 alone this year trying to cross the
California border,'' said Sen. Rosa Albina Garavito of the
Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Gabriel Jimenez Remus of the National Action Party, the
conservative opposition, said: ``Per capita earnings, inflation,
the devaluation of our money, the millions of poor and the
unemployment that squeezes our growing population, all make our
country still part of the Third World -- only now without any
hope.''

JUST TWO GOOD: HOUSTON COMETS REPEAT AS CHAMPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MICHAEL MURPHY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Raise the roof, baby.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the folks who run Compaq Center will have to do to
accommodate the steadily growing number of banners the Houston
Comets and Houston Rockets are accumulating.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets added banner No. 2, matching the total the Rockets
have collected, with an 80-71 victory over the Phoenix Mercury on
Tuesday night in Game 3 of the WNBA Finals. But the Comets did it
much faster than the stodgy old Rockets, winning their second
straight championship after taking the WNBA's inaugural title last
year.
</P>
<P>
   This could get to be a habit.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what the fans are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the roof, which is what league Most Valuable Player
Cynthia Cooper's trademark arm-pumping, palms-to-the-skies gesture
signifies, is exactly what the 16,285 fans who packed Compaq Center
seemed intent on doing, creating an explosion of deafening noise
that threatened to blow the roof off the house.
</P>
<P>
   And it seemed as though every member of that crowd, which
included NBA players David Robinson, Sam Cassell, Avery Johnson,
Nick Van Exel, Mario Elie, Mark Bryant and Emanual Davis, was still
around long after the final buzzer sounded, singing, chanting,
dancing and waving homemade signs in a blizzard of red, white and
blue confetti cascading from the rafters.
</P>
<P>
   While the trophy-presentation platform was being assembled on
the court, players leaped on the press table and danced while
Comets coach Van Chancellor paraded around, embracing his
1-year-old nephew, Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   The championship was a fitting end for a team that set all kinds
of league records, the most amazing of which was winning 90 percent
of its regular-season games, finishing an astounding 27-3. Success
like that leads to raised expectations, which often derails a
team's championship drive.
</P>
<P>
   But the Comets seem to thrive on such pressure, as they
illustrated again Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While it was a storybook-ending for the Comets, it was a
disappointing finish for the Mercury, who came oh, so close to the
title Phoenix coach Cheryl Miller had predicted for her team.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the Comets were intent on raising another banner,
Miller raised eyebrows by predicting _ during the regular season,
mind you _ that her Mercury would not only win the WNBA title, but
beat the Comets in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   The last time anybody made a playoff prediction that audacious,
it was Moses Malone uttering his now-famous ``Fo', fo', fo',''
prediction for his 1983 Philadelphia 76ers, meaning three straight
four-game sweeps to the title. It turned out Malone was just one
game off, as was Miller's prediction.
</P>
<P>
   It would have made a great story, especially when the Mercury
had to win its last four regular-season games just to make the
playoffs, and then had to go three games to knock off stubborn
Cleveland, winning the final game on the road. The Mercury then
beat Houston in Game 1 at America West Arena, leaving Phoenix one
game away from fulfilling Miller's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the been-there, done-that Comets who quietly went to
work, rebounding from that Game 1 loss by rallying for a clutch
five-point overtime victory in Saturday's second game.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Comets in the same situation they faced last
season _ one game to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   Those are odds the Comets love.
</P>
<P>
   You could have predicted what was going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets came out and set the tone immediately, getting an
NBA-distance 3-pointer from Sheryl Swoopes just nine seconds into
the game. But their second title wasn't going to be that easy.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets were up to the task, however, making the plays down
the stretch, when championships are won _ outscoring the Mercury
18-10 in the final 7:22.
</P>
<P>
   And when the buzzer sounded, it was time to celebrate. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Raise the roof. They're running out of room in the building as
it is now.

   NEW YORK _ The women in white celebrated 25 years of equal
treatment and equal paydays Tuesday at the U.S. Open as Day 2
yielded another innocuous first round of victories for the seeded
favorites. The sport's old-girl network mingled with the teen-age
terrors, and a pair of comeback queens with sentiment on their
side, the five-time champion Steffi Graf and the Open's perennial
little girl lost, Jennifer Capriati, had their 1998 Open crusades
evolve in distinctly different directions.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Graf, who missed last year's Open while
recuperating from knee surgery, marched straight ahead into the
second round after a mildly exerting 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 dismissal of
20-year-old Corina Morariu.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come in here and say I am going to win,'' said Graf,
who earned the most recent of her 21 Grand Slam crowns here at
Flushing Meadows, Queens, in 1996. ``Who knows? Maybe I can win. I
missed only one year, so it hasn't been that long.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Capriati, whose ranking of 109 is a reflection
of the muddled straits of her game, was given the daunting
opening-round assignment against third-seeded Jana Novotna. Not
surprisingly, Capriati foundered in straight sets and lost her
fourth match in four meetings with Novotna, the artistic Czech
veteran. Capriati's 6-4, 6-3 defeat marked the fourth consecutive
Open, as well as the sixth time in her last seven Grand Slam
events, that she has taken a first-round tumble.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams, who raced unseeded into her first final here in
1997, is seeded fifth and appropriately ferocious and ambitious
this year. Expecting to retrace her steps from last year's
breakthrough, Williams instructed Reebok to design seven outfits
for 1998, one for every round. Tuesday night, Williams wore a
navy-and-gold ensemble with fingernails to match and pranced
through her first-round test against 68th-ranked Elena Wagner, 6-1,
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The encounter was verging on a farce by its final game, with
both competitors reduced to a case of giggles after Wagner, cranked
an underhand serve into the net, and followed that with a
standard-issue overhand serve that also landed in the net and
produced the double fault that gave Williams a triple match point.
Williams wounded up needing three more, then blithely twirled her
racquet atop her index finger as she showboated her way to the net
for the customary handshake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who don't improve are left behind,'' said Williams, who
predicted a brave new power game for the women's circuit in the
near future _ with her at the helm.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, sixth-seeded Greg Rusedski of Britain, who
served his way into last year's final, came perilously close to
taking a first-round fall, as did 12th-seeded Jonas Bjorkman, who
outlasted 17th-ranked Cedric Pioline, 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, 6-7 (3-7),
6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski needed to squirm past two match points held by Wayne
Ferreira of South Africa before escaping with a 4-6, 7-6 (7-2),
5-7, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4 victory. Rusedski _ who was hobbled by ankle
trouble and a much-publicized divorce from his coach, Tony Pickard,
this summer _ fired just 19 aces in the 3-hour-8-minute match.
</P>
<P>
   Rusedski, who complained of blisters during the match and later
said he also had difficulty adjusting to the quick conditions on
the main stadium court, denied that he had placed any performance
pressure on himself at the Open: ``I'm not feeling any pressure at
all; I knew I had a difficult draw. If I win, I win. If I don't,
then I will be gone, shall we say.''
</P>
<P>
   One player who was not glad to be gone was Capriati. ``It is a
little sad in a way,'' Capriati said of the heartening reception
she received from her fans, whose post-match cheers inspired her to
stand up and raise her arms in appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like I won or something,'' said Capriati, who recalled
hearing advice that ranged from ``we miss you; keep coming back''
to ``don't give up.'' ``I was a little surprised, but it makes me
feel good that they're still like that. It's encouraging. I know it
can only get better from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, at long last a Wimbledon champion after a series of
tear-jerkers there but not yet a crowd-pleaser at the Open, did not
wear a black hat into Tuesday's match with Capriati. It just seemed
that way.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Novotna wore classic whites and played her
classic game, and she was certain she had been miscast as the
villain by the full house that jammed the old Louis Armstrong
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Capriati broke Novotna for a 4-3 lead in the first set, the
crowd revved itself with anticipation, but when she gave the break
straight back by dropping her own service game at love, the buzz
turned to apprehension. And after Novotna charged to a 5-0 lead in
the second set, the mood changed to desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Secure in her victory, Novotna, who was critical of the WTA Tour
two years ago for giving Capriati's comeback attempts such a high
level of attention, tried to be polite about the enemy atmosphere
she endured while eliminating the underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, what can I do?'' Novotna said. ``I won Wimbledon, but
I can't expect everybody to root for me at every single tournament;
you have to realize that Jennifer has been through some tough times
and I guess it is very natural that she got such ovations. People
wanted to see a breakthrough; you just have to deal with that.''

 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Her hair is a cool, dazzling silver. Her band is a
blend of New Orleans funk, rootsy country and jagged, spooky rock
with a drummer sporting Dennis Rodman hair. It's 95 outside, but
she's wearing a black, ersatz patent-leather jacket, sipping hot
chicken noodle soup and shivering in the air-conditioning at the
Rockefeller Center studio where she's taping an appearance on
``Late Night With Conan O'Brien.''
</P>
<P>
   Emmylou Harris has always zigged when the rest of the music
world has zagged. But after doing country long before it was
remotely cool, and then getting exiled by country radio along with
virtually everyone else over 40, she seems more adept than ever at
finding the seams between the formulas emanating from Nashville and
the commercial no man's land, vaguely known as alternative country,
outside the Nashville mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris, whose new album, ``Spyboy,'' is a live career
retrospective that's more a reimagining of her past than a look
back at it, has fashioned one of the more intriguing musical
careers in the country environs.
</P>
<P>
   But whether it's an indication of how to push the borders of
country or a reminder of just how hard it is to try is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate in that for me there's life beyond radio,'' said
Ms. Harris, now 51, who first came to prominence while singing
harmony with the seminal country rock artist Gram Parsons in the
early 1970s. ``I stick my head in the sand and get to do the kind
of music I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris, whose early ties to Parsons and the Flying Burrito
Brothers left her with one foot in rock and the other in country,
has never been a traditional Nashville success story. She first
came to town as an outsider with a suspect rock pedigree and is now
regarded as something of a keeper of the flame while Nashville
churns out contemporary pop country. Born in Birmingham, Ala., into
a traveling military family, she first planned to be an actress,
then gravitated to folk music and then became an integral part of
Parsons' hip country hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   After Parsons' death in 1973, Harris put together a band that
included several of Elvis Presley's musicians and recorded ``Pieces
of the Sky,'' a mix of pure hard-core country like the Louvin
Brothers' ``If I Could Only Win Your Love'' and more eclectic
material.
</P>
<P>
   It became a No. 1 country album and helped pave the way for a
new generation of country artists with crossover appeal like Lyle
Lovett, Steve Earle and Nanci Griffith. Ms. Harris went on to win
seven Grammys and has since become, with the singer Marty Stuart,
one of the Nashville artists most involved with country's history
and heritage.
</P>
<P>
   And as country devolved toward the current vogues for hunks and
hunkettes in hats, she took an adventurous detour in 1996 with
``Wrecking Ball,'' her collaboration with the famed producer Daniel
Lanois that merged country instincts, Ms. Harris' high, aching
soprano and Lanois' eccentric rhythms, chiming guitars and ragged
edges.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration with Lanois, best known for his work with Bob
Dylan, U2, Peter Gabriel and others, seemed an unlikely one, but
she said it always made sense to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how far out he gets and how much fancy technological
stuff he does, you always feel the melody and the song is at the
center of it all,'' she said. ``I wanted him to take my voice and
my vision and make me an instrument, another color in that
landscape, another of his paintings, so to speak. I like the way
he's fearless. He'll really try anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new album named for her band _ the name ``Spyboy'' comes
from the New Orleans term for someone who comes before a Mardi Gras
parade to get the audience excited _ follows in the same spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The band includes the bassist Daryl Johnson and the drummer
Brady Blade, who played on ``Wrecking Ball,'' and the Nashville
guitarist Buddy Miller, who's very much a part of the
Americana-alternative country scene.
</P>
<P>
   It includes songs from throughout her career refracted through
the Lanois prism, with the most affecting being the newer pieces
like, ``All My Tears,'' written by Miller's wife, Julie Miller,
which mixes gospel lyrics with dark, spectral rock instrumentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrecking Ball'' was a huge critical success that won a Grammy
for best contemporary folk album and helped re-energize her career.
Her current projects include a Gram Parsons tribute album she's
helping to oversee, singing with Willie Nelson on his new album
``Teatro,'' plans for a duet album with Linda Ronstadt and the
release of a sequel to the 1987 ``Trio'' album she did with Ms.
Ronstadt and Dolly Parton.
</P>
<P>
   That it took a noncountry album with a New Orleans producer to
get her airplay _ on adult alternative rock stations _ is a
metaphor for Nashville in general, which is awash in wonderful
music, much of it ignored by country radio and the big labels.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a bit rootless; I had to discover my bloodlines through
Gram,'' she said. ``But Nashville at its best is a small town.
Lucinda Williams lives two doors down. Nanci Griffith isn't far
away. So's Harlan Howard, the granddaddy of all the great
songwriters. The songwriting community is truly extraordinary.
There's nothing in New York that could compare with songwriter's
night at the Bluebird Cafe. One night, I saw Townes Van Zandt,
Steve Earle and Guy Clark doing a benefit for a low-income dental
clinic. It was one of the best shows I've ever seen, and you
wouldn't see it anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   She laments the way so many of her favorite Nashville artists _
artists who get labeled more as Americana than country like Ms.
Williams, Gillian Welch, Mike Henderson, Kieran Kane and Jamie
O'Hara, not to mention country legends like Merle Haggard, Waylon
Jennings or Johnny Cash _ don't have a natural space on country
radio or in the big-label Nashville mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Harris has been around long enough to know that the
music business needs to create new stars and discard old ones. And
she doesn't fault the most successful younger artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``People bash Garth Brooks, but Garth is just a guy who has a
great voice, made some great records, and it's not his fault the
music business went crazy looking for clones of Garth. Sounds like
a horror movie. Clones of Garth! But it's not his fault. Is he
supposed to change so everyone else can change? All I know is that
I don't hear as much interesting stuff on country radio as I know
is out there. I wish they could mix it up a little.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she said, categories are becoming so blurred
that perhaps the limitations of country radio and mainstream
Nashville mean less than they once did.
</P>
<P>
   She has expanded her audience by touring with the Lilith Fair,
and Ms. Williams' new album, ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,'' is
getting a lot of attention, even if it will never be played on
country radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone said to me that country is probably in danger of
disappearing as a genre, just like the blues,'' she said. ``Maybe
it's becoming absorbed into a more global musical picture. I don't
know if that's true, and I don't know if it's necessarily bad.
Maybe it's a reflection of the way we live, and it's OK as long as
we have the pure forms of music to listen to and be inspired by.
People ask me what's country music, and I say I don't know if I
know. And I'm not sure I care. I know what it was in the past. But
when I listen to Lucinda Williams' record, I don't care what they
call it. They can call it `Bertha.' I just think it's a
masterpiece.''
</P>
<P>
   The chicken soup has gotten cold, and she needs to get back to
taping the show. And she's been around long enough to know that
musicians are better off obsessing about their music than obsessing
about the music business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've managed to survive for 25 years,'' she said. ``There were
times when my record company couldn't do enough for me and times
when we couldn't agree on what I should be doing. But you can only
spend so much time worrying about whether radio likes you or
understands you or that kind of thing. If you're going to let that
stop you, you probably shouldn't be doing this.''

DETROIT PAPERS ORDERED TO REHIRE STRIKERS AND PAY BACK WAGES  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs last graf for correction making clear NLRB specifically cited
Detroit News for failing to tell how merit system would work.)  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruling that two Detroit newspapers had not bargained in good
faith, the National Labor Relations Board Tuesday ordered them to
rehire hundreds of reporters, drivers, pressmen and other workers
who went on strike three years ago and to give them millions of
dollars in back wages.
</P>
<P>
   The board said that to make way for the reinstated workers, The
Detroit News and The Detroit Free Press might also have to lay off
hundreds of employees hired as permanent replacement workers during
the strike, which began in July 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders called Tuesday's decision, which upheld part of
federal administrative law judge's 1997 ruling, a major victory.
The six unions, including the teamsters, the typographers and the
Newspaper Guild, estimated that 1,200 workers who went on strike
were awaiting reinstatement, but the newspapers put the number at
642.
</P>
<P>
   The board found that the unfair labor practices were a cause of
the strike. Under federal law, employers may not use permanent
replacement workers to displace employees participating in such a
strike, and are required to pay back pay.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials estimated that the company owed about $80
million in back pay, a sum the newspapers are expected to challenge
as too high. Workers who found jobs elsewhere are eligible to
return and are entitled to back pay amounting to their lost salary
minus whatever pay they received in other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Mark Silverman, publisher of The Detroit
News, said the newspapers would appeal the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The board ordered the newspapers to reinstate the workers within
21 days, although that order is likely to be delayed pending
appeal. The newspapers also said they would not lay off any
replacement workers to make way for the strikers.
</P>
<P>
   The unions were badly hurt during the strike by nearly 2,500
workers because the two newspapers continued operating. But the
strike also hurt the newspapers, which lost more than $100 million
and saw their combined circulation plunge to 600,000 from 900,000
when the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally Tuesday in Detroit, workers said the ruling was the
best news for them since the strike began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased with the decision,'' said Shawn Ellis, a
teamster who drives a newspaper delivery truck and is a spokesman
for the Detroit Metropolitan Council of Newspaper Unions. ``Now
it's time for company officials to take this opportunity to make
this community whole again and to create quality journalism in the
Detroit area again.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers struck after rejecting the newspapers' plans to buy
out several hundred union jobs and reorganize the distribution
system. In February 1997, 19 months after the walkout began, the
strikers agreed to an unconditional offer to go back to work, but
were taken back only as openings developed. Management said the
agreement was a surrender, but the union continued its litigation
of unfair labor practices and urged a boycott of Detroit
Newspapers' parent companies, Gannett and Knight Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   The board, three Democrats and two Republicans, was unanimous in
its main points. It found that the newspapers had failed to bargain
in good faith because after insisting that all raises be based on
merit, The Detroit News repeatedly declined to tell the unions how
a merit system would work and how much money would be put into the
merit raise pool.

YANKS BEAT A'S AS WELLS FLIRTS AGAIN WITH PERFECTION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Wells had been in this magical situation
before, not so very long ago. Wells was looking so powerful and so
much in control on the mound. His fastball was zooming past the
Oakland batters, his curveball was dancing all the way toward home
and virtually every pitch he unleashed was slithering into the
strike zone. Wells was, well, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee left-hander carried a perfect imitation of himself
being perfect into the seventh inning Tuesday night and turned
Yankee Stadium into a baseball fun house. Hardly anyone in the
crowd of 36,534 was expecting much suspense or drama from a game
between the out-of-this-world Yankees and the not-in-their class
Athletics, but Wells supplied enough suspense and drama to fill a
season. Again.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-0 Yankee victory _ their 99th of the season _ became a
footnote, especially since the Yankees scored six of their runs off
Tom Candiotti in the first two innings. The focus instead shifted
solely and squarely to Wells and another pursuit of perfection. The
pitcher who last week gave his teammates snazzy rings to
commemorate his perfect game against the Minnesota Twins on May 17
was trying to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Every time Wells pushed a count to two strikes, the fans stood
and hollered and screamed and shouted until he bagged another out.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unforgettable scene in the Bronx, but Wells made it so
very special, until Jason Giambi slapped an 0-2 curveball over
second base with two out in the seventh. He was the 21st batter
Wells had faced and the first one he failed to retire. The perfect
game was gone and Wells finished with a two-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Though five pitchers have thrown two no-hitters in a season, no
pitcher has ever turned in two perfect games in a career, let alone
a season. But Wells had flirted with the distinction, and the fans
appreciated it.
</P>
<P>
   Wells remained stone-faced after Giambi's hit, even as the fans
chanted, ``David! David!'' The curveball to the left-handed Oakland
batter did not snap like the dozens he had thrown in the game;
Wells left it too close to the middle of the plate and his effort
at double perfection fizzled seven outs short.
</P>
<P>
   Wells struck out a season-high 13 in firing his third shutout
over his last five starts, his fifth shutout of the season and
setting a career-high with his 17th victory.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh inning started ominously as Wells fell behind 3-0 on
Rickey Henderson, his first three-ball count of the game. But he
threw two rapid strikes and then got Henderson to hit a looping
liner to right field, which Paul O'Neill rushed in to catch. Wells
pumped a 1-2 fastball past Ryan Christenson, but then succumbed to
Giambi.
</P>
<P>
   Because Wells was piling up strikeouts and because of his recent
history, the fans started sensing something special early. When
Wells caught Henderson looking at a 2-2 pitch to start the fourth
and Henderson groused, the fans roared. After O'Neill hustled into
the right field corner to catch Christenson's flyball, they roared
some more.
</P>
<P>
   When Wells got Giambi to ground a ball to Tino Martinez and
chugged to first base to cover, they were even louder. It was
September, but it felt like May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Since players are very superstitious about not mentioning a
perfect game or a no-hitter to the pitcher who is compiling it, it
seemed amusing when the Yankees showed a tribute to Don Larsen's
perfect game on the scoreboard before the bottom of the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen tossed his perfect game against the Brooklyn Dodgers in
the 1956 World Series, the only other Yankee to pitch one.
</P>
<P>
   If the larger-than-life reminder bothered Wells, he did not show
it. He got Matt Stairs to ground out to open the fifth and then
whiffed Mike Blowers on a 2-2 curveball and made rookie Ben Grieve
look like a statue as he caused him to stare at three straight
pitches for another strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Wells increased the decibel level in the Bronx by blazing past
the A's in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Scott Spiezo on a 2-2 curve ball, fooled Miguel
Tejada with another sweet 0-2 curve and pumped a 1-2 fastball on
the inside corner to whiff A.J. Hinch, who was so enraged after the
called third strike that he slammed his bat on the plate,
splintering it.
</P>
<P>
   After Hinch was ejected by plate umpire Jim McKean, manager Art
Howe burst onto the field and gave the second-best show, next to
Wells, of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Howe angrily kicked dirt onto both sides of the plate and raised
his hands above his neck and below his knees, presumably suggesting
that McKean was calling anything close by Wells a strike.
</P>
<P>
   By improving to an awesome 99-37, the Yankees are almost certain
to break the American League record of the fastest team to reach
100 victories, which the Cleveland Indians accomplished in 140
games in 1954. But, no matter when the Yankees win their 100th, it
is unlikely the atmosphere will be as electric as it was Tuesday
night. Wells provided that magic.

CONGO EXILE GROUP SEEKS KABILA'S OUSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ A new factor in the Congo war emerged
here Tuesday when a somewhat mysterious group of Congolese exiles
called for a new government to replace President Laurent Kabila's
embattled regime.
</P>
<P>
   The group brought their case before the international press
corps here by hoodwinking officials at a summit meeting of the
Non-Aligned Movement into allowing them to use the official press
room.
</P>
<P>
   The group, led by a surgeon and a law professor, said that they
represented Congolese who hate the corruption and anti-democratic
tendencies of Kabila's government and that they want peace. But
they dodged reporters' questions about whether their organization,
the Council of the Federal Democratic Republic of Congo, is a front
for Rwanda and Uganda, which are said to be backing the revolt in
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The council is advised by an American, Robert Stanford Stewart,
who said his mining concessions in Congo had been voided by Kabila
and handed over to a relative of President Robert Mugabe of
Zimbabwe, who has sent troops to Kabila's aid.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Kabila government, who took the same
podium half an hour later to denounce Rwanda and Uganda, said they
did not know the opposition group, but suggested that it was a
front for mining companies. Stewart denied that.
</P>
<P>
   The Congolese government delegation also complained to the South
African government about letting the group walk through the
supposedly tight security and make an appointment to use the
official press room. A Congolese delegate scuffled briefly with the
head of the opposition group.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the South African Department of Foreign Affairs
said later that it had been ``a mistake'' to give the group a
platform. The conference of the Non-Aligned Movement is open only
to recognized governments and excludes opposition movements. It is
made up of 113 countries, most of them poor, which during the Cold
War considered themselves free of both the American and Soviet
orbits.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of the Berlin wall, the movement has been
struggling to redefine its role. But its six-day conference here is
being overshadowed by a sideshow: All the countries involved in the
Congo war are attending, as is the U.N. secretary-general, Kofi
Annan, and they are holding peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesmen for the Congolese opposition group were Raphael
Amisi, who said he was a cardiac surgeon and the group's president,
and Kalay Kabongo, who said he was a law professor at the Sorbonne
and the first deputy president. Speaking in French, they said they
represented 15 ``technocrats'' from the country's 15 provinces,
mostly in exile, who had formed a ``mediation body'' to restore
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   They said the Kabila government's days are numbered, and accused
it of ``tribalism, corruption, arbitrary arrests and appalling
governance.'' They denied having political ambitions, saying they
wanted to install a transitional government to make peace and call
elections within six months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked about the group's relations with the Tutsi-dominated
governments in Uganda and Rwanda, they replied that they are
``nonpolitical'' and ``not xenophobic,'' and had met with all
parties in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who said he was a former director of Bechtel engineers
and former chairman of American Mineral Fields, a Canadian mining
company, said the group had nothing to do with the Tutsi or with
Rwanda or Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his relationship to Congo was, he said that he had
written the Bechtel engineering group's master plan for rebuilding
the country, and that when he was chairman of American Mineral
Fields, the company had had a contract with the Kolwezi copper
mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kabila tossed the plan back in our faces, saying, `We don't
need white men, we don't need the West,''' Stewart said of the
Bechtel study. On the American Mineral Fields deal, ``he asked us
for bribes,'' Stewart added. ``The country's dead as long as he's
running it. Every mining project in the country is stalled.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said the mines seemed to have been taken over by Wheels
of Africa, a company he said was run by ``a young relative of
Mugabe's.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said he was a 1968 Yale graduate who had worked in
Africa for 30 years. He denied representing current mining
interests, or that any of them would win contracts back if Amisi's
group were to come to power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country's a mess,'' Stewart said. ``This council just
wants to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.''
</P>
<P>
   At a later news conference, Kabila's foreign minister,
Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe, said of the opposition group: ``We
don't know who they are, what they are, what color they are _ they
might be green. But it's unacceptable that you listen to people who
accept mining contracts and you find haven't been able to pay.''

   NEW YORK _ Jonas Bjorkman had just finished his first-round
victory over Cedric Pioline in five sets on Tuesday, but as
Bjorkman remained standing to avoid cramping inside the men's
locker room, his workday was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   What lay ahead for the Swedish star was a short jog, stretching,
rehydration, massage and treatment on the left thigh that began
troubling him in the latter stages against Pioline. In all, the
process would take as long as Bjorkman's 2-hour-59-minute victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that the players would drink some fluids after a
match and then head back to the hotel, but that's not the way it is
anymore,'' said Bob Russo, the senior trainer for the United States
Tennis Association.
</P>
<P>
   Success at the highest level of men's tennis is not simply a
question of how well you serve, pound ground strokes or handle
pressure. It is also a question of how well you recover, and in
Grand Slam events, where men's matches are three of five sets, a
player's powers of recuperation are even more essential.
</P>
<P>
   Just as racquet technology has evolved dramatically in the last
two decades, so has the science of therapy and the therapeutic
means that players have available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Some pros, like Todd Martin, now travel with portable electric
stimulation machines that help speed muscle recovery. There is also
widespread use of nutritional supplements (including creatine) and
protein drinks after matches to replenish lost or damaged amino
acids and help the body rebuild muscle tissue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seven years ago and before that, players would just be gutting
it out with water and bread and bananas,'' said George Fareed, a
southern California physician who works with the U.S. Davis Cup
team.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1993, there were no full-time massage therapists for the
men at the U.S. Open. This year, there are 24, and at least six
times that many clients, which makes for a bustling training room
in the early rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovery is a huge factor now,'' said Todd Snyder, who has
been Pete Sampras' personal trainer for the last four years.
``There are a lot of things you can't control in tennis: the
quality of the opponent, the let cords on important points. But the
one thing you can control is your body, and you have to look out
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was looking out for Sampras at Flushing Meadows in 1996
when he staggered his way through a five-set test of endurance and
character against Alex Corretja in the quarterfinals and then
staggered into the training room cramping and dehydrated.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving fluids intravenously _ an extreme and relatively
rare remedy for dehydration on tour _ and working with Snyder late
into the evening, Sampras was able to recover quickly enough to win
his final two matches and fourth Open singles title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the areas where guys have really improved is
that they realize their preparation for a match starts as soon as
the last match is over; there is not a lot of celebration time,''
said Doug Spreen, an athletic trainer with the ATP.

<P>
   The search for an edge has become increasingly frenetic on tour,
with its increasing talent pool and monetary rewards. Fareed said
he is aware that some players have been taking large doses of
creatine, a legal over-the-counter supplement that helps build
muscle mass and energy reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be used cautiously in tennis,'' Fareed said. ``I
recommend no more than five grams a day, but I suspect some players
have been using 30 to 50 grams.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of anti-inflammatories is also widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen overuse and I worry about that,'' Fareed said.
``I've seen some players develop gastritis and others esophagitis,
and they are hampered by that. You can develop bleeding in the
intestinal system and be more susceptible to infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Some players are now opting for herbal anti-inflammatories,
which are injectable and do not have some of the unpleasant side
effects.
</P>
<P>
   The moment Sampras walks off court at a Grand Slam event, Snyder
hands him a drink containing the sorts of electrolyte minerals that
players lose in abundance. Snyder will then help Sampras stretch
for about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Stretching alone is not as useful, according to Snyder, because
it is more difficult to isolate muscles. (When you grab your own
toes to stretch a hamstring, you are also using abdominal muscles
to execute the movement.)
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after that, Snyder will give Sampras a short
30-minute massage. Snyder calls this a ``flush-out rub'' because he
believes it ``softens and loosens any tight spots'' and keeps
muscles from going into spasm.
