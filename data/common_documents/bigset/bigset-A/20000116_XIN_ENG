<HEADLINE> Younger Singaporeans Encouraged to Master Mother  Tongue Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said here Saturday that younger Chinese
Singaporeans must not only speak Chinese but also read it as well
so that they can acquire a deeper appreciation of Chinese culture
and moral values.
</P>
<P>
He also said the teaching and learning of the Chinese language
cannot be confined to the school environment, and the family, the
community and the media must to play their part to help Singapore'
s younger generation master their mother tongue.
</P>
<P>
Lee made the remarks when he officiated at the launch of a new
Chinese weekly for primary school pupils, which is published by
the Chinese Newspapers Division of the Singapore Publishing
Holding.
</P>
<P>
Lee noted it is the mother tongue that gives one crucial part
of value, roots and identity and access to cultural heritage and a
world-view.
</P>
<P>
"Reading is as important as the other language skills of
listening, speaking and writing," he said. "It is an important way
to improve students' proficiency and keep alive their interest in
the language."
</P>
<P>
"More importantly," he said, "if students can read stories,
idioms and literary works in Chinese, they can absorb more of the
richness and vigor of the originals which are hard to convey in
translation, and thus acquire a deeper appreciation of Chinese
culture and moral values."
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister also said that The Chinese language
Syllabus B examination paper for O and A Level in Singapore will
be open to students next year, a year earlier than last announced.

<HEADLINE> Large U.S. Delegation Arrives in Baghdad to Survey Sanctions Impact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A large U.S. delegation of more
than 50 members led by former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark
arrived in Baghdad on Sunday evening to study the impact of the 10-
year-old embargo imposed on the country.
</P>
<P>
Clark said upon arrival that the embargo clamped on Iraq
represented a severe violation of human rights and a deliberate
genocide perpetrated by the governments of the United States and
Britain.
</P>
<P>
He said that this U.S. delegation came to Iraq to voice its
solidarity with the Iraqi people who have been exposed to severe
sufferings due to the continuation of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Clark said the delegation members will tell the American people
the crimes committed by the U.S. government against the Iraqi
people and press the government to lift the embargo.
</P>
<P>
This is Clark's third visit to Iraq since the imposition of the
U.N. sanctions on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Clark
has been a strong advocate of the lifting of the U.N. sanctions on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. delegation comprises representatives of humanitarian
organizations, political figures, union members, university
professors and students.

<HEADLINE> Barak Says No Deal With Syria Unless Lebanon Included </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak said Sunday that no peace agreement can be reached with Syria
unless the talks are widened to include Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak made the remarks at a weekly cabinet meeting, in which he
briefed his ministers on the second round of peace talks he held
with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk al-Shareh in Shepherdstown, West
Virginia earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed talks late last month after nearly four
years of stalemate, but Lebanon has yet to restart its talks with
Israel, although it is widely expected to follow the suit of Syria
very soon.
</P>
<P>
Barak has promised to bring Israeli soldiers out of a border
zone in southern Lebanon by July this year. To fulfill such a
promise requires an agreement with Lebanon and Syria, which is the
main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has rejected an Israeli offer that labeled Israeli
pullout from southern Lebanon with necessary security arrangements
by Beirut, saying it would not deal with Israel unless Israel
reaches a comprehensive peace package with both Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that the issue of Lebanon is an important card
held by Damascus in its negotiations with Israel over the fate of
the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
The next round of Israeli-Syrian talks will resume in
Shepherdstown Wednesday. Barak said at the cabinet meeting that the
talks has entered "a critical stage."
</P>
<P>
Opposition Likud party leader Ariel Sharon criticized Barak for
linking the Lebanese track with the Syrian track, saying Barak is
attempting to pressure the Israeli public to accept a possible
Israeli withdrawal from Golan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the charges, Barak's Labor party said Sharon has
no right to tell the prime minister what to do on Lebanon since it
was the right-wing leader who led Israel into the mire in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sharon was the architect of the 1982 Israeli invasion of
Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Hasten Development in Southeastern Regions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit vowed on Sunday to speed up economic growth in east and
south Turkey, the least developed parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the pledge while answering questions on
a TV program "Sunday Panorama", which was broadcast live on TRT 1
Channel.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that his previous government has prepared a
comprehensive bill to encourage productive investments in the
eastern and southern regions, which are adjacent to Iran, Iraq and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit emphasized that the economic development in these regions
must be stepped up under the 57th government under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit noted that the continuation of the terrorist activities
carried out by the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has
impeded the government's endeavors to promote development in the
areas.
</P>
<P>
He said the government attaches great importance to education
reforms in changing the backwardness of the regions.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit promised to lift emergency rules in more provinces of the
regions given the fact that terrorism has been in decline since the
arrest of Abdullah Ocalan, the rebel leader of PKK. Two provinces
have already been freed from emergency rules since last June.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit called for more foreign investments in the regions,
declaring that he will lay stress on this during the forthcoming
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Enidtem

last month that Weizman had received about 453,000 U.S.dollars from
French businessman Edouard Seroussi between 1988 and 1993, while he
was a member of the parliament, without reporting or paying taxes.
</P>
<P>
The president has admitted that he received the money from
Seroussi, one of his long-time friends, but stressed that the money
was received only as a nontaxable personal gift before he was
elected president.
</P>
<P>
He also contended that his private attorney in charge of his
financial affairs had told him getting the money was legal.
</P>
<P>
Seroussi's lawyer, Pinhas Rabin, said Saturday seroussi would
give evidence in Weizman's favor if this were required.
</P>
<P>
Elected president in 1993 and being on his second five-year
term, Weizman has been resisting pressure from the opposition to
resign. He said he will think about the next step only after the
investigation ends.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges Burundian Parties to Accept Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela on Sunday urged Burundi warring parties
to accept peace for the sake of development and progress of the
tiny central African country.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to have a sense of urgency in the on-going
peace process," Mandela told heads of 18 Burundian political
parties and delegations involved in peace negotiations in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
In his first speech as the new mediator in Burundi peace talks,
the Nobel Peace laureate stressed that he will only help them
reach a decision, but the responsibility of achieving a peace deal
lied exclusively with the Burundians.
</P>
<P>
Mandela last month replaced former Tanzanian President Julius
Nyerere, who died of leukemia last October, as facilitator to the
Burundi peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In his one-and-half-hour speech, Mandela also emphasized that
peace process must be all-inclusive, not only 18 parties but also
armed rebel groups which are not represented at the peace talks in
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he has invited six heads of state to attend
the next round of peace talks in February, including President
Bill Clinton of the United States, Jacque Chirac of France, King
Faud of Saudi Arabia, Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria, Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda and Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Some 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have died in six
years of civil war in Burundi between Hutu rebels and the
government led by minority ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks, which began in June 1998, have made
little headway.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians to Continue Consultations With Jordan on Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) will continue consultations with Jordan on the latest
developments of the Palestinian-Israeli peace process, a senior
Palestinian official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Visiting PNA Minister of Culture and Information Yasser Abid
Rabbo, who is also Palestinian chief negotiator with Israel, made
the remarks in a meeting with Jordanian Foreign Minister Abdul
Illah Khatib.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was focused on the peace process in the Middle East
and particularly obstacles on the Palestinian-Israeli track after
Israel decided to delay its third-phase troop withdrawal from the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Khatib said Jordan was concerned over the developments.
</P>
<P>
Israel announced Saturday it would postpone the troop pullout
planned for January 20 until the end of the meeting between U.S.
President Bill Clinton and PNA leader Yasser Arafat in Washington
slated for the same day.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops should withdraw from another 6.1 percent of
Palestinian lands in the West Bank under the third pullout plan
envisaged in the Sharm El Sheikh agreement, signed by Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Egypt last December.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides have yet to remove differences over the
areas targeted for the third-stage withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Abid Rabbo's one-day visit to Amman was part of a bilateral
consultation mechanism between Jordan and the Palestinians on the
regional peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has been a key peace broker in the region after it signed
a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, the second Arab country
following Egypt to strike a peace deal with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has been persistent in its support for what it
called legitimate rights of the Palestinians, including the
establishment of an independent state on their own soil.

<HEADLINE> No Official Preparations for Puppet Leader's Return: Kuwait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti cabinet said on
Sunday it had made no previous preparations for the return of Al Aa
Hussein, head of the so-called provisional Kuwaiti regime installed
by Iraq during its occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued after the cabinet's weekly session said Al Aa
arrived in Kuwait "totally upon his own will."
</P>
<P>
The statement asserted that necessary procedures have been taken
to refer him to the relevant judicial authorities to execute the
death sentence issued against him almost ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Khalid Abdel Jaleel, lawyer of Al Aa, said Sunday
that the state criminal court will start examining his case on
February 20.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his four children, Al Aa, who was holding a
Norwegian travel document valid for one trip only, arrived at the
Kuwaiti airport from Oslo, Norway, early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested by the state security personnel and taken to the
Central Prison. His children, three sons and one daughter, were
handed over to their relatives.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that within a few days following the August
1990 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, Al Aa Hussein, once a young
lieutenant in the Kuwaiti army, along with eight other men who
worked in the Ministry of Defense, was taken to Iraq and placed
under house arrest by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
It was announced by Iraq at the time that the eight men formed
the "provisional (Kuwaiti) government," headed by Al Aa.
</P>
<P>
After the liberation of Kuwait, the eight men were released at
the Kuwaiti border and each given 50,000 U.S. dollars by Iraq. As
they said on their return, they were forced to cooperate with the
Iraqi regime and Kuwaiti legal authorities acquitted them of any
wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
But Al Aa Hussein was given a death sentence by a Kuwaiti court
in 1991 on charges of high treason.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Claim To Find Spherical Molecule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists have
claimed to have discovered a spherical molecule, the second in the
world after the one found in the mid-1980s, the Press Trust of
India (PTI) reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The first spherical molecule, fullerene, is a soccer-ball-
shaped one consisting of 60 carbon atoms. The discoverers, Harold
Kroto, Richard Smalley and Robert Karl, were awarded the Nobel
Prize about a decade later after the discovery.
</P>
<P>
However, the new molecule is different from fullerene, said
scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology based in Kanpur,
400 km southeast of here.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery is significant since spherical molecules are
very rare in microscopic world," said Sabyasachi Sarkar, who
created the molecule along with his colleague Shatarupa Sarkar and
German scientists.
</P>
<P>
The molecule, consisting of 72 molybdenum and 30 iron atoms,
might be used for a variety of applications, PTI quoted Sabyasachi
Sarkar as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sphere, roughly three times bigger than fullerene, can be
opened and shut at will, a property that could be exploited for a
large number of applications which require trapping of molecules,
PTI said.
</P>
<P>
It would come in handy in studying many other physical and
biological phenomena, Sarkar said, adding that new theories need
to be developed to explain properties of this molecule.
</P>
<P>
Unlike fullerene, the new molecule is stable, soluble in water
and might be used to trap viruses, Sarkar said.

<HEADLINE> Blair Pledges Health Cash Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Sunday pledged to inject more cash into the crisis-hit
National Health Service (NHS) but said it would take time to put
things right.
</P>
<P>
Blair made the remarks following a week of sustained attacks on
the government's handling of the NHS, BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The government has come under fire from politicians, health
professionals and the public after the service was put under
severe strain by an outbreak of winter flu.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have had their operations canceled as
hospitals scrapped routine surgery to cope with a flood of
emergency admissions.
</P>
<P>
Blair insisted that pressing on with NHS modernization and
investing more money -- without rises in income tax -- was the way
to rebuild the service.
</P>
<P>
He said his government would match the share of national wealth
spent by other European countries on health at the end of five
years.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the measures required to improve the
NHS would take years to have an effect.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the NHS fell below the standards enjoyed by
Britain's European partners.
</P>
<P>
Britain spends about 6.7 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP) on its health services while Germany and France spend about
10 percent. The European Union average is 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Labor medical expert Lord Winston said the government had
deceived the public by letting the NHS run down to new lows and
cutting health funding to below that of Poland.
</P>
<P>
Health spending would rise to the European Union average if the
government increased health funding by 5 percent per year in real
terms for three years, Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He rejected suggestions that the NHS could be financed from
higher income tax and said plans for an income tax cut would not
be changed.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is important we do it without raising income tax.
We gave a commitment not to raise standard rates of income tax,"
Blair said of his party's pledges before its 1997 election win.
</P>
<P>
Blair also said proposals that more people switch to private
health care were unrealistic because many of Britain's elderly and
vulnerable could not afford this.
</P>
<P>
"The idea that private health care is going to help us in a
situation where two thirds of patients in beds are over 65 is an
illusion," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
The Observer newspaper published a poll Sunday showing that
three quarters of Britons would prefer Blair to abandon plans for
an income tax cut in order to pour money into health.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Calls for Drug Eradication Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Myanmar drug
control official has urged transit countries as well as consumer
nations to endeavor for law enforcement, and called for
international support and cooperation in drug eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
Police Major-General Soe Win, secretary of the Myanmar Central
Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), made the call at a
meeting Saturday in Tachilek, the eastern Shan state, where
foreign correspondents were invited to witness Myanmar's illicit
poppy crop eradication programs as well as crop substitution and
income substitution in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
"We still feel that based on the principle of shared
responsibility, it is the moral imperative for the donor community
to play the role of a staunch supporter of the efforts against
illicit narcotic crops," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it would be almost impossible without
international cooperation and assistance to win the fight against
drug production.
</P>
<P>
There are constant allegations that Myanmar, as part of the so-
called "Golden Triangle," is producing over 2,000 tons of opium
annually, he said, accusing the United States of conducting an
annual survey on the country's border areas through satellites and
publicizing cultivation areas and potential production figures to
criticize Myanmar for not doing enough to stem the production.
</P>
<P>
While the potential yield is calculated to be declining
drastically in the last two years, actual figures may be much less,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The important issue is not the figure but what we should do
together to solve the underlying problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that before 1988, Myanmar received full support and
cooperation from Western countries, particularly the U.S., which
offered assistance to drug suppression efforts.
</P>
<P>
"But due to insurgency and security problems, success was not
achieved as anticipated," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also complained that no international support has been
forthcoming although peace has already prevailed in the country,
adding that Myanmar has been left alone to fight the drug menace
on its own meager resources.
</P>
<P>
He voiced Myanmar's determination to achieve the goal of total
elimination of poppy production and said the government is drawing
up a 15-year plan consisting of three five-year phases.
</P>
<P>
He added that the goal will be achieved sooner rather than
later if there is assistance from the international community.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Ministry of Border Areas Development of
Myanmar has so far spent 443.65 million Kyats (1.38 million U.S.
dollars) on crop substitution programs alone and the sum is second
only to infrastructure component spending of 9.653 billion Kyats (
30 million dollars) for building roads and bridges in remote
border areas.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the ministry has invested 14.057 billion
Kyats (43.9 million dollars) for the development of border areas
where poppy cultivation is the mainstay.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar CCDAC Friday organized a three-day field trip to Wa
region, the country's Shan state. Foreign correspondents based in
Myanmar as well as those based in Bangkok were invited to join the
trip to witness the destruction of some illegal poppy fields and
to visit agricultural farms there.

BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Bayi Rockets took a sweet
revenge over Beijing Ducks for a 122-76 victory at a 17th round
match of the Chinese Basketball League on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The defending champion, who lost to Ducks in the sixth round
match, showed its vengeful determination all through the game and
allowed few chances for the visitors as they led the half-time 50-
32.
</P>
<P>
Ducks tried to turn the situation by strengthening its defence,
but all the efforts were squandered by its poor attack. With the
absence of its backbone Ba Te'er in the second half, Ducks was
cracked 18-34 and 26-38 by Rockets in the last two quarters.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yudong scored the game-high with 34 points, while the
sparkling center Wang Zhizhi added 23 for Bayi, who leads the
standings with 16 wins.
</P>
<P>
"Only a big win like this can comfort our pained hearts of the
failure in the previous round," said A Dijiang, head coach of the
Bayi Rockets, referring to its only upset of this season sent by
the Ducks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 16 (Xinhua)-- The first international
seminar on the development of China's vast western areas will be
held in Chongqing, the largest city in southwest China, from June
18-22.
</P>
<P>
Attending will be more than 150 Chinese officials and
development experts, 50 members of the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), and representatives from the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF). Organizers are the Chongqing
municipal government, the UNDP, the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences and the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Seminar discussions will mainly focus on the relationship
between China's western development and the global economy. Also
on the agenda are talks on the government's role in the plan,
market renovation and management, urban construction and the
economic development of China's non-public ownership.
</P>
<P>
The overall economy of western China, which covers nine
provinces and autonomous regions and Chongqing Municipality lagged
far behind that of the other areas in the nation. China's central
government has made up its mind to jump-start western development
to accelerate the local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing is one of China's old industrial bases and is an
advanced commercial center.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Urges to Speed up Congo Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) ended a one-day extraordinary
summit here on Sunday, and published a communique urging to speed
up the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano chaired the summit, which
was also attended by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Rwandan
President Pasteur Bizimungu, whose countries have been involved in
the year long civil war in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, the DRC President Laurent Kabila and the rebel leaders
did not show up at the summit.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, Kabila's absence did not have much
impact on the summit because the participants only discussed the
issues of their concern over the DRC problem.
</P>
<P>
"We have contacted him through many channels but got no
response, perhaps he has things of more importance to attend to,"
the SADC chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The summit reiterated in the communique "the importance and
validity of the Lusaka ceasefire agreement of July 10 as a
fundamental instrument for the process of a peaceful settlement of
the conflict in the DRC."
</P>
<P>
The leaders called for urgent meeting of all the belligerents
to speed up the the implementation of this accord.
</P>
<P>
The summit also reaffirmed the importance of the involvement of
the United Nations, the Organization of the African Unity, the
SADC and of the whole international community in the search for a
global and lasting solution to the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
"The summit encourages them to continue with their political
and diplomatic efforts aimed at the achievement of the intended
results," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the summit called on the U.N. Security Council to
send a full peacekeeping force to the DRC.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Chissano told reporters that as concrete
steps to speed up the DRC peace process, the SADC will hold
another meeting on political issues concerning the Congolese
crisis in Zimbabwe's capital Harare on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Reincarnated Tibetan Living Buddha Succeeds Throne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- At a ceremony in this capital
city of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region today, a two-
year-old boy succeeded the throne of the Sixth Raiqen living
Buddha.
</P>
<P>
The Seventh Raiqen living Buddha, just over two years old,
participated in the ritual of succession, initiation into the
monkhood, and the ceremony to give him a Buddhist name in front of
a statue of Sakyamuni, known as the founder of Buddhism, inside
the Johkang Temple in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Qoipei, vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, presented
an official certificate from the regional government to approve
the Seventh Raiqen living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was presided over by Losang Gyalcan, mayor of
Lhasa, and attended by Qi Xiaofei, a representative official from
the State Administration of Religious Affairs, local officials and
representatives of other Lhasa temples.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth Raiqen living Buddha, Dandzim Jigme, died of illness
on February 13, 1997. A group of monks from the Raiqen Monastery
formed to take charge of the search for the reincarnation in
accordance with religious tradition. They determined that Soinam
Puncog, born in Lhari county north of Lhasa on October 13, 1997,
was the reincarnated child.
</P>
<P>
The new living Buddha will participate in a grand ceremony to
mark his ascension to the throne and the beginning of his
religious life.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama, the Raiqen
living Buddha is one of the highest-ranking positions in Tibetan
Buddhism. The tradition of patriotism and the spirit to preserve
the unity of the Chinese nation have long been advocated by Raiqen
living Buddhas.

<P>
KHARTOUM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A bomb ripped through an
important pipeline carrying crude from the Higlig oil fields in the
south of Sudan to a port in the Red Sea for export.
</P>
<P>
An official from the company that runs the oil project told
Xinhua that the blast went off at dawn on Sunday, about 200
kilometers from oil-loading terminal 5 of Albashaer port.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the sabotage, which
disrupted crude flow along the 1,610-kilometer-long pipeline, with
a daily transportation capacity of 160,000 barrels.
</P>
<P>
This was the third incident of its kind that happened since the
pipeline went operational last August. The first bombing took place
in a place 16 kilometers away from Albashaer port, and the second
occurred near Atbra city, some 300 kilometers to the north of
Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The managing company has sent a technical team to repair the
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese government forces have been fighting southern rebels,
led by John Garang. The rebels are seeking autonomy for the

In retaliation, two Israeli planes fired two rockets at the
guerrillas' positions at the outskirts of the village of Zawtar
just north to the central sector of the Israeli security zone while
two helicopters fired eight rockets around the same area.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Bayelsa Governor Threatens Secession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Bayelsa State Governor
Deprieye Alamieyeseigha Saturday threatened to withdraw from the
federation if the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)
headquarters is sited outside the state.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Guardian newspaper on Sunday, the
governor made the remarks against the background that the the
Senate and the House of Representatives are expected to discuss
the site of NDDC headquarters next week.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Senate is in favor of Yenagoa, Bayelsa's
capital, as the headquarters of NDDC while the House of
Representatives prefers Port Harcourt of Delta State.
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly, the issue of NDDC headquarters will determine
the level of my people's relationship to our present federalist
structure," Alamieyeseigha said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "for us in Bayelsa, we see it as a first step of
acceptability of our being part and parcel of the Nigerian state."
</P>
<P>
"Bayelsa is central to all the nine states in the Niger-Delta.
We share boundaries with at least five states," said the governor.
</P>
<P>
Alamieyeseigha stressed that if the original concept of the
Niger Delta Development Authority (NDDA) created by the Olusegun
Obasanjo regime in the early 70's is followed, Yenagoa as
headquarters would not be disputed.
</P>
<P>
"Bayelsa," he said, "affords a rush of fresh air, symbolic of
our country's quest for a new way of doing things that will make
all Nigerians feel as one."

<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Powerhouses China encountered
stiff challenges from African champions Nigeria here Sunday before
edging out Nigerians 3-1 and winning the Hong Kong International
Women's Soccer Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
"We should score more goals because we lost too many chances in
the second half," said Chinese head coach Ma Yuanan.
</P>
<P>
"We are very happy to play world runners-up China," Nigerian
chief coach Mabo Ismaila said, adding that the result could be re-
written if the match were held in another country.
</P>
<P>
"We'll work hard back to our country, and let's see what
happens in Sydney Olympics," said Ismaila.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, who ranked fifth in last year's women's World Cup in
the United States, got off to a good start with their manlike
style and tough play, which made the Chinese back to the defense
in the first 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
World and Olympic silver medallists China opened the scoring
when Zhang Ouying slammed home in the box after catching a long
pass from teammate Jin Yan in the 32nd minute.
</P>
<P>
But the Nigerians equalized just one minute later as Ifeanyi
Chiejina angled the ball home after a sudden-attack.
</P>
<P>
The second half saw the Chinese girls gaining an upper-hand
with repeated attempts, most of which, however, were squandered by
the Chinese players themselves.
</P>
<P>
Chinese captain Sun Wen lifted China to 2-1 in the 79th minute
when she caught a throw in the box and right-footed the ball home.
</P>
<P>
China secured the victory when Zhang Ouying convinced a penalty
and finished the match at 3-1.
</P>
<P>
In the match deciding the third place on Sunday, Hong Kong
Invitation Team beat South Korea 2-0.
</P>
<P>
The four-team competition is organized by the Hong Kong
Football Association (HKFA).

<HEADLINE> China's Tourism Revenue to Surpass 3 Trillion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China has mapped out its 20-
year tourism development plan which estimates that by 2020, the
country's tourism revenue will skate past 3.3 trillion yuan,
accounting for eight percent of the country's total GDP.
</P>
<P>
China has what it takes to reach the goal, with its unique
tourism resources and the world's biggest domestic tourism market,
said He Guangwei, director of the China National Tourism
Administration at the ongoing National Work Conference on Tourism
in this special economic region in southern Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, by 2020, the number of overseas
tourists to China will reach between 135-145 million, up 1.1-1.3
times over the figure from 1998.
</P>
<P>
Domestic tourism revenues will reach 1.9 trillion yuan to 2.7
trillion yuan, up 6.9 times to 10.3 times.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China's international and domestic
tourism market expanded quickly. To date, the number of overseas
tourists it receives and its international tourism revenues rank
6th and 7th in the world respectively, compared with their
standing at 48th and 41st in 1978.
</P>
<P>
And China boasts the world's highest total of domestic tourists.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's tourism demand will continue to surge in
the next 20 years, with the country's rapid economic and social
development and the constant improvement of living standards.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Exchange on Seismological Science Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese seismologist
today called for closer cooperation between seismological agencies
across the Taiwan Straits to help both sides find ways to reduce
losses caused by earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
He Yongnian, director of the Cross-Straits Center for the
Exchange of Seismological Science and Technology, said at a press
conference here today that both China's mainland and Taiwan are
located on major seismological belts.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes pose a serious threat to life and property on each
side of the Taiwan Straits and threaten their economic growth and
social progress, said He, who will lead a 12-member delegation to
Taiwan tomorrow for a seminar on swapping seismological
information between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life on the mainland are deeply
concerned about the earthquake which devastated Taiwan on
September 21, He said. Chinese seismologists have closely followed
the trend of earthquake development, because such a big earthquake
is likely to alter earth crust stress range in Taiwan, Taiwan
Straits as well as coastal areas in southeast China, He said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has gained a vast store of earthquake experience
as a result of a dozen powerful tremors in the past 30 years. "We
would like to pass on our experience and lessons drawn from
previous earthquakes to our counterparts in Taiwan so that they
can effectively reduce the losses bought on by earthquakes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, seismologists on the mainland are aware
that their colleagues in Taiwan have attained high levels in some
areas in seismological science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The Cross-Straits Center for the Exchange of Seismological
Science and Technology was founded in October of 1998 with the aim
of promoting exchanges on seismological science and technology
between two sides of the Straits. The center has carried out
numerous programs in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Experts from both sides will attend a seminar on earthquake
prevention and disaster reduction in Fuzhou this May.

<HEADLINE> China Becomes One of Top 10 Aviation Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China has become one of the
world's top 10 aviation countries after 20 years' rapid
development, an official of the Civil Aviation Administration of
China (CAAC) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The country now ranks 10th globally in terms of transport
turnover, up from 35th in 1980, with passenger turnover up to
seventh from 33rd, according to Xia Xinghua, director of the
Policy and Regulations Department under the CAAC.
</P>
<P>
Xia attributed the feat to the CAAC's efforts to stimulate
investment from local governments and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
China added 46 planes to its aircraft fleet in 1999, of which
36 were purchased and 10 were rent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the CAAC has opened 1,122 routes, which
cover a total length of 1.54 million kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local governments had invested a total 42.9
billion yuan in airport construction projects, which also
attracted foreign loans of 1.23 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CAAC has promised to open part of its civil
aviation service market to introduce international competition.
</P>
<P>
Chinese airlines are permitted to have their planes and engines
repaired in foreign countries. Foreign service providers can also
establish joint-venture repair companies in China, said the
official.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies will be able to employ foreign experts and
managers, and China's computerized ticket-booking systems are also
allowed to work with their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The appearance of competition is expected to prompt the Chinese
aviation sector to improve its service, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China to Lift 10 Million People Out of Poverty This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao warned at today's working conference on
poverty relief that China faces grave challenges in achieving
those goals in 2000.
</P>
<P>
He noted that provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities
have worked diligently to help eight million poor people out of
poverty in the past year.
</P>
<P>
Wen urged earnest implementation of the responsibility system
that holds local leading Party and government officials
accountable for the work.
</P>
<P>
As funding for poverty-relief continues to increase, focus must
be placed on poor areas in need of major capital construction
projects, including infrastructure involving transport and water
conservancy, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
Supervision of funds for poverty relief should be tightened and
those who divert or misuse these special funds must be severely
disciplined, the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all sectors to help poverty-stricken people
out of their circumstances.

<HEADLINE> PNA Protests Israeli Decision to Delay Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator for
interim affairs Saeb Erekat has called his Israeli counterpart Oded
Eran for a meeting to protest the Israeli decision to lay the third
phase of withdrawal set for next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Erekat told the Israel Radio that the Israeli postponement of
the pullback is a unilateral decision and is in violation of the
agreements signed between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Palestinians should have been briefed
beforehand on this decision by the Israeli government itself, not
by the media.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Radio quoted sources in Jerusalem as saying the Sharm
el Sheikh memorandum signed in September allows a delay of two to
three weeks.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants to
wait for the the outcome of the talks due to be held between the
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and the U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington on January 20.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet announced the postponement Saturday evening and
an Israeli spokesman said Barak wants to determine the areas of the
further 6.1 percent withdrawal after the meeting between Arafat and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has strongly condemned the Israeli move. Nabil Sha'ath,
Palestinian minister of planning and international cooperation,
confirmed that the PNA rejects the suspension and demands Israel to
withdraw according to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Voice of Palestine radio Saturday night,
Sha'ath accused Israel of deliberately prolonging the execution of
the signed accords.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el Sheikh memo, Israel should hand over 6.1
percent of West Bank to full or partial Palestinian control on
January 20.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Extends Ceasefire To Boost Peace, Aid Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese government has
prolonged a ceasefire with south rebels as of midnight, January 15,
to support peace efforts and facilitate emergency aid delivery to
the hunger-stricken south.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Abdin, undersecretary at the Foreign Ministry, has said
that the three-month extension of the truce declared six months ago
was enacted in an effort to achieve a comprehensive solution to the
17-year civil war, which and ensuing famine have claimed nearly 2
million lives.
</P>
<P>
The Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) has been waging a war
against the Islamist government for greater autonomy for the
Christians and animists in the south. But the conflict is
complicated by widespread inter-factional fighting and rebellions
in the north.  SPLA and government officials held the fifth
round of peace talks in Nairobi, Kenya, on Saturday, but the two
sides, who are expected to start face-to-face negotiations on
Monday, were still far from reaching compromise.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides agreed to hold a referendum on self-
determination for the south, but have failed to agree where the
boundary between north and south lies.
</P>
<P>
The government says the division should be along the
boundary set by Britain when it granted independence to the
Africa's
largest country in 1956.
</P>
<P>
But the SPLA argues that the province of Abyei -- taken away
from the south four years earlier -- should also be included.

<HEADLINE> Airbus Plans to Sell 1,200 New Giant Aircraft in 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European aeronautic group
Airbus Industrie SA plans to sell 1,200 A3XXX giant passenger
planes in the next 20 years, said Airbus executive officer Noel
Forgeard in an interview with the Sunday paper Journal du Dimanche.
</P>
<P>
The A3XXX can carry 800 passengers and is mainly designed for
air companies which fly long distance to Asian countries and
usually meet with bad sky conditions.
</P>
<P>
Forgeard expected that the A3XXX will be put into service in
the later half of 2005 after its assembly line is launched at the
end of this year, either in Toulouse, France, or Hamburg, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. Boeing has estimated that it will sell 360
aircraft in the next 20 years, three times lower than that of
Airbus.

GUANGZHOU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Veteran striker Hao Haidong
scored on a superb toe flick to help hosts China for a 1-0 victory
over Uruguay here on Sunday in the final of the Four Nations
friendly tournament.
</P>
<P>
All alone on the attack, Hao raced into the penalty area,
collected an aerial pass launched from mid-field and looped it
high over the head of the Uruguay's goalkeeper in the fourth
minute on the first half.
</P>
<P>
Though Uruguay produced several scoring opportunities before
the interval, neither side were able to change the scoreboard in
the remainder of the match.
</P>
<P>
The South American powerhouse brought only five national-team
regulars, with the remainder mainly consisting of young talent
fighting for the country's under-23 Olympic team.

China, who beat New Zealand by the same score on Friday,
claimed a moral victory as they head into qualifiers for the Asian

<HEADLINE> Poll: Living Standards of Chinese Urban Citizens Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Most of Chinese urban residents
said that their living standards have improved, according to a
poll released here today.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 6,400 citizens in 14 cities showed that their
monthly salaries averaged 821 yuan (about 98.9 U.S. dollars), or 9,
850 yuan for the whole year of 1999.
</P>
<P>
In three municipalities, Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin,
citizens' average annual salaries surpassed 10,000 yuan, said the
survey conducted by 14 information organizations.
</P>
<P>
About 40 percent of 6,352 respondents said their living
standards had improved, 44 percent said their living standards
remained basically unchanged, while 15 percent claimed theirs went
down.
</P>
<P>
 Most of the people who said their living conditions improved
are government officials, employees at profitable enterprises,
technical professionals, teachers, doctors and retired persons.
</P>
<P>
They said that lower prices of commodities was an important
factor contributing to the improvement of living standards,
according to the survey, conducted in the cities of Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, Nanjing, Changchun, Harbin, Suzhou,
Jinan, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Xi'an and Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
It found that 0.6 percent of citizens earned less than 250
yuan a month, 10.4 percent earned between 251 and 500 yuan, 46.3
percent earned between 751 and 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 14.2 percent earned between 1,001 and 1,500 yuan
and 7.3 percent garnered more than 1,500 yuan. The remaining five
percent did not answer the poll.
</P>
<P>
Among those who said their living standards lowered, nearly
half were laid-off workers and employees working at unprofitable
enterprises. There were also complaints about the increase of
tuition for children and higher medical costs.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Planning System Greatly Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The architects of China's
economy have drastically reformed the traditional planning system
to bring about a fundamental change in the country's thinking,
style, and approach toward economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The planning measures that have played a major role in helping
the country achieve an economic 'soft landing' will certainly have
a role when drafting the 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005),
according to senior economic planners attending a weekend seminar
on China's 50-year economic planning and its future prospects.
</P>
<P>
China should do more to improve development planning and
implementation if the country wants to sustain the upbeat momentum
seen in the past 20 years, seminar participants said.
</P>
<P>
Economic plans should focus on balancing reform, development,
and stability, as well as population, resources and environment,
they said.
</P>
<P>
Future planning, which should be macroeconomic, strategic, and
policy-oriented, should be placed as top priority in areas that
concern the national economy and social development as a whole,
they suggested.
</P>
<P>
In the early years of New China, the central economic planning
system contributed handsomely to the establishment of the country'
s own industrial sectors and the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Since the reform and opening-up drive in the late 1970s, China'
s economic planners have come to realize that a centrally-planned
economy is not equal to socialism, and economic planning is not
contradictory with market economy.
</P>
<P>
The 10th Five-Year Plan will put forward objectives and
policies to continue rapid economic growth, improve economic
structures, eco-systems and environmental protection, and raise
international competition.

<HEADLINE> HK Treasury Secretary Delivers "Letter to Hong Kong" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary for the Treasury of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Denise Yue,
called attention to the problems of public finances in her "Letter
to Hong Kong" broadcast at RTHK Radio 3 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The letter followed earlier reports that the HKSAR government
is planning to introduce a sales tax as a long-term measure to
help avoid budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
"We all take for granted the low level of taxation which we
enjoy in Hong Kong," Yue said.
</P>
<P>
However, the factors supporting the low level of taxation have
changed and the seeds of a problem are starting to grow, she said.
</P>
<P>
Yue cited the adherence to the user-pays-principle for funding
many of the government services and the high levels of revenue
from land and property transactions over the recent years as two
major contributory factors to keep taxes low.
</P>
<P>
But because of the economic circumstances in Hong Kong, nearly
all fees and charges have been frozen for two years. And because
of the legislature's reluctance to approve increases in charges in
the past, water and sewage charges, for instance, have not been
increased for five years, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As property prices stabilize, the huge windfalls are unlikely
to recur in the future, Yue said.
</P>
<P>
Yue also told the public that there are other issues on the
horizon that pose a threat to the revenue base, citing the impact
of illegal gambling and the rise of gambling through the Internet
on the HKSAR government's income from betting tax as an example.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR recorded a fiscal deficit last year and is forecast
to see its balance book in the red this year and next year.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR government has to strive to achieve a fiscal balance
in the near term according to the Basic Law, which demands prudent
financial management.

CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority
chief Abdel Fattah Katto has left for Washington to follow up with
the investigation into an EgyptAir flight which crashed off the U.
S. coast on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Katto said that a report on the causes of
the crash will be punished soon, the Arabic daily Al-Ahram reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
After the crash incident that killed all the 217 people aboard
the plane, the U.S. has claimed that the co-pilot deliberately
crashed the jumbo jet in a suicide attempt. The allegation has
enraged the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayyan said last Monday that "
the plane plummeted because of something that happened in its
tail," adding that the Egyptian team working with the U.S.
investigators "refuted all the allegations made about the plane's
crew."
</P>

Katto left here Saturday to meet with Jim Hall, head of the U.S.

<HEADLINE> S.Asian Peace-keeping Training Begins in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 16 (Xinhua) -- An international peace-
keeping training event, co-organized by Nepal and the United
States, began here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nepal, Sri Lanka, the United States and Bangladesh are
participating in the "South Asian peace-keeping multi-platoon
training event," and soldiers from these countries will gather
here and have coordinative training and military exercises from
January 16 to 31.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the event, Prime Minister Krishna Prasad Bhattarai
said that as maintenance of world peace has remained one of the
most important aims of the United Nations, it is indeed a step in
the right direction that the South Asian multi-platoon training
event is being organized.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the training is to enhance the readiness of
troops to be deployed on peace-keeping duty, increase the capacity
for mutual action among multi-nation peace-keeping forces and
emphasize peace-keeping under international law, agreements and
norms.
</P>
<P>
"As the peacekeepers are drawn from the armies of various U.N.
member countries, this multinational force needs to develop
coordinated and unified operational mechanism," said Bhattarai in
his inaugural speech.
</P>
<P>
"Before embarking on their challenging task of a peacekeeper,
there is a need to develop some understanding of international
laws, relevant agreements and norms which will better prepare them
to be engaged in their duties." said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The training will be observed by military observers from 18
countries, each of which will send two. These countries are
Australia, Canada, China, Fiji, India, Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan,
Madagascar, Malaysia, the Maldives, Mongolia, New Zealand, the
Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Thailand, Tonga and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Also present for observation will be 10 representatives from
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
It is the first multi-nation peace-keeping training held in
Nepal which has taken an active part in U.N. peace-keeping
missions. More than 35,000 soldiers from the Royal Nepalese army
have served in U.N. peace-keeping forces and 35 of them have died
in peace-keeping missions.

<HEADLINE> Lagos Governor Rejects Indictment over Inaction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- For the second time within three
days, Lagos state governor, Bola Tinubu, has rebutted on Saturday
 President Olusegun Obasanjo's indictment of inaction over the
security situation in his state.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian on Sunday quoted the governor as saying in a
letter that he had held constant dialogue with various militant
groups including the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC) and the Ijaw
Youth Congress, who were behind the violent incidents of the past
months.
</P>
<P>
I had the talks only with a view to encourage them to adopt
peaceful approach to the solution of their perceived grievances,
not to support the violence as indicted by the president, said
the governor.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo had in a letter, dated January 13, accused Tinubu of
having lost control of the near-anarchy situation in Lagos and
threatened to declare a state of emergency if the situation is
not arrested.
</P>
<P>
The president accused Tinubu of being a complicity in the
"condemnable acts of criminality" by the Oodua Peoples Congress
(OPC) given that the perpetrators of the disorder are !0known or
should be known to you, as many of them are known to claim to be
under your protection!1.
</P>
<P>
Tinubu blames the worrying security situation in the state on
the abysmal failure of the Federal Government to provide necessary
personnel and resources, including training and empowerment for
the Nigerian Police.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Warns Ocalan to Be in Silence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit has warned Kurdish rebel Abdullah Ocalan to keep in silence
on the government's decision to suspend his hanging.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said Ocalan should "be quiet" on the decision
amid the continued angry public reactions to the stay of his
execution, Turkish Daily News reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) which
has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey, was sentenced to death by Ankara State
Security Court last June on charges of treason, separatism and
terrorism. The verdict was upheld by Turkish Supreme Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Turkish ruling coalition, however, decided last Wednesday
through tough talks to postpone his hanging until the European
Court of Human Rights completes its review of an appeal he has
filed.
</P>
<P>
Relieved after the decision, Turkey's No.1 criminal issued a
statement through his lawyers, urging the state to reform within
the framework of European Union harmonization and claiming the
decision"a step in that decision."
</P>
<P>
He said that "democracy needs to be strengthened both in content
and procedure in Turkey," adding PKK would try to contribute to
peace and democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Ecevit was afraid Ocalan's inexpedient
remarks would fan the indignation of the families of the dead
Turkish soldiers killed in the 15-year clashes with the PKK.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Syrian government was quick to respond to last week's
publication of the American draft of a peace treaty, leaking Syrian
President Hafez Assad's desired corrections to a Lebanese newspaper
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The corrections demanded by the Syrians, as published in the
Lebanese A-Safir newspaper, touch upon most of the sections of the
draft and make it clear that the way to agreement is still strewn
with problems.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel will not carry out a planned troop withdrawal from the
West Bank this week, Prime Minister Ehud Barak decided on Friday.
Israeli sources indicated that Barak wants to put off the pullback
until a full picture of the negotiations with the Palestinians
become clear.
</P>
<P>
Denouncing the delay, Palestinian officials denied rumors that
the Palestinian National Authority and Israel have reached a tacit
agreement allowing a three-week delay of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Maariv:
</P>
<P>
-- A special police team set up Friday will begin this week to
examine documents and material related to President Ezer Weizman's
acceptance of a large sum of money from French businessman Edouard
Serioussi.
</P>
<P>
The investigation, apparently to be held in the president's
residence, is expected to last some two weeks. Weizman's office has
stressed that the president would not resign over this issue.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel enjoyed its lowest rate of inflation in more than
three decades last year, as the consumer prices index (CPI) edged
up just 1.3 percent, the Central Bureau of Statistics said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In response, Barak's office said the low index was the result of
the government's responsible economic policies that place Israel
among the first rank of the world's advanced nations. But critics
said this was achieved at the price of economic growth and
employment.

<HEADLINE> Eight More Colleges to Be Opened in Afghan  University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Eight more colleges for boys
and girls will be opened in Afghan University in Peshawar,
Pakistan's border city where some one million Afghan refugees live
around, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The management of the university has decided to open three
more girls' colleges and five more boys' in the near future," APP
quoted university officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Five Afghan universities were merged in April 28 last year to
establish Afghan University.
</P>
<P>
The university has a Medical College for Women where about 500
girls are getting education.
</P>
<P>
The university also has colleges of Computer Sciences and
Journalism for girls and colleges of Agriculture, Engineering and
Computer Science for boys, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Chief of the university Dr. Hazrat Mir said the
university is facing financial difficulties because the
organizations which had pledged economic and technical support
have not honored their commitment.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the financial problems, he said, the university has
decided to charge fees from the students to meet its expenditure.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Anti-Crime Body Calls for Action Over  Internet Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Crime Prevention
Foundation Sunday called for taking effective action to minimize
the problems of pornography and electronic gambling (e-gambling)
in cybercafes as they have negative influence on teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Police have identified at least 20 cybercafes being used as e-
gambling in the Klang Valley area (Kuala Lumpur and its
surrounding area) alone, according to the foundation's Vice
President Lee Lam Thye Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Parents have complained to me of their children's unhealthy
activities in the cybercafes and this is a serious problem,"
Bernama news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The public are rightfully concerned over pornography on the
Internet and the police are monitoring cybercafes used for e-
gambling, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the local authorities to ensure constant surveillance
as part of the enforcement to prevent the misuse of cybercafes for
negative activities.
</P>
<P>
He said both parents and teachers as well as management at
workplaces could cooperate to check the problem.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need for a registration in cybercafes of
their facilities and services provided to the public so as to
assist the authorities in making inspection.

NANNING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 40,000 rural children
who dropped out of school have returned to classrooms in the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in south China thanks to the
implementation of "Project Hope."

In the past 10 years, the autonomous region has received over
120 million yuan (14.5 million U.S. dollars) cash donations for
the project.

<P>
"Project Hope" has sent 80,000 local children back to school.
According to official statistics, some 725 of them are now
studying in colleges or universities.
</P>
<P>
The donations have also helped the Guangxi Autonomous Regional
Government to set up 448 Project Hope Primary Schools and help

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Stock Exchange Suffers Net Capital Outflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The exchange attributed the result to the country's high
interest rates, long economic recession and poor corporate
performance.
</P>
<P>
The main share index shed around 20 percent of its value last
year, the exchange reported.
</P>
<P>
The net capital outflow in December was 129,760 dollars against
616,415 dollars in November, the exchange said, adding that
foreigners in December only brought in two companies, investing a
total of only 218 dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, local brokers said they expected the market to slowly
start registering net foreign capital inflows this year if the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) resumes leading to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In mid-December, the IMF decided to resume talks with the
Kenyan government on the 205-million-dollar aid package which was
suspended more than two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Armed Robberies Reach Alarming Levels In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Economic hardships have caused a
hiking of violent crimes and armed robberies in most parts of
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Over the New Year's holiday, armed robbers got away with more
than seven vehicles and property worth 100,000 U. S. dollars in
separate incidents throughout the capital city of Harare, the
Sunday Mail newspaper quoted Harare Central Police as saying.
</P>
<P>
In many other parts of the country, similar reports have also
been highlighted in the local media.
</P>
<P>
In view of the increase in the number of armed robberies, the
Ministry of Home Affairs has recruited more than 2,500 new
officers to beef up the police operations, during which a number
of notorious criminals were nabbed.
</P>
<P>
According to Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa, the
increase in armed robberies is attributed to the prevailing
economic hardships in the country and increasing unemployment
rate.
</P>
<P>
"There is an unusually high number of people who are
unemployed and have resorted to illegal means of earning a
living," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have, however, increased our forces and they will be
cracking down on all such undesirable elements," the minister
said, adding that very soon the situation would be under control.

<HEADLINE> Famine Still Threats Kenya: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite the November-December
rains in parts of Kenya, the famine situation remains grave in
the country, experts have warned in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report, Kenya Vulnerability Update, released recently by
the U.S. Agency for International Development, says the short
rains have raised hope though subsequent maize production will
still fall below the normal level.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that 315,000 tons of maize will be harvested
compared to the normal output of 410,000 tons, the report says,
adding that even with imports from Uganda and Tanzania, the 1999

<HEADLINE> Some Congolese Rebels Desert: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- About 100 Congolese who joined
the rebels of Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in western Uganda
are now deserting after Ugandan troops destroyed some of their
bases in their heavy offensive in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
They quit the ADF because of the capture of their bases in
Bukwale, Mboma and Masule in the district of Bundibugyo, a
Congolese deserter was quoted by Sunday's New Vision daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that ADF rebels, who recently launched a spate of
attacks on both security and civilian targets in western Uganda,
suffered heavy losses following the offensives by the Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF), adding that all other rebel camps
in the Rwenzori Mountains had been captured.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that UPDF are intensifying their
offensives against the ADF rebels who began to kill and maim in
the area in 1996. They are combing the mountains for rebel bases
after the rebels were forced to enter western Uganda on being
repulsed in the eastern parts of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Refutes Report of Backing Coup in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has refuted a Monitor daily report that he backs the
Burundi coup d'etat by President Pierre Buyoya in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the President's Office described the
 allegation as "totally false", saying:"President Museveni did not
at any time say or imply that he supports President Buyoya for
taking power through a military coup as alleged by the Monitor."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Museveni as saying at a press conference on
Friday that he supports the coup in Burundi in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"President Museveni explained that in the case of Burundi, the
leaders had decided to deal with the government of President
Buyoya as a way of ending the trauma of the people of Burundi. He
said that although the leaders condemn coups in Africa, they had
in the case of Burundi taken into consideration the reality of
the politics in Burundi since independence which have caused so
much suffering," the press release added.
</P>
<P>
It said that Museveni was one of the leaders who pushed for
economic sanctions to be placed on the Burundi government as a way
of putting pressure on it to start moving that country to the
democratic path.
</P>
<P>
 Ugandan President Museveni, Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa and Burundi President Buyoya addressed a press conference
after holding two days of talks in Entebbe, 40 km south of
Kampala, in an attempt to push for national reconciliation in
Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The rebels in Burundi have killed about 200,000 civilians.
World and regional leaders have urged all parties to the conflict
to iron out their differences and end the civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 8,000 Angolan refugees
are facing starvation at Sinjembela, a remote post in Zambia's
Western Province, according to a report by the Sunday Times of
Zambia newspaper.
</P>
<P>
With the anticipated escalating refugee figures, an imminent
serious shortage of food is looming in the area, the newspaper
quoted United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
spokesman Musengo Kayombo as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official said that only one four-ton truck laden with
relief maize meal, cooking oil, beans and salt has so far been
sent to the area because of the poor road.
</P>
<P>
He said while more trucks would soon be sent to the area with
relief supplies, his organization is concerned with the poor road
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
However, Kayombo said that the refugees stranded in Sinjembela
would soon be moved to Siyoma, a place 100 kilometers away where a
new refugee camp would be opened soon.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR in Lusaka, the number of Angolan
refugees crossing to Sinjembela to flee heightened fighting
between the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) rebels and Angolan government forces has soared up to over
7,500 during the past two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Earthquake has less Casualties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAO'AN (YUNNAN), January 16 (Xinhua) -- A deeper focus and
uniqueness of quake, prompt actions taken by government officials
to displace residents and locals' quake-related knowledge are
cited as major causes for less casualties from a recent major
southwest China quake.
</P>
<P>
Shi Shaoxian, a research fellow with the forecast center of the
Yunnan Provincial Seismological Bureau, said the focus of the
earthquake with a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale that had
jolted the county of Yao'an on Saturday morning was some 30 km
below the ground surface, while the focus of most quakes occurred
previously was just 10 km below the surface.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, an earthquake measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale
jolted Yao'an County at 07:37 hours Saturday morning, awakening
local residents who rushed out of their houses before a follow-up
stronger tremor occurred, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Among other reasons, local government officials are perfectly
capable of evacuating villagers to safer sites immediately after
the first quake.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, local people know quite well about the rudiments on
earthquake and how to protect themselves after the tremor, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reveal that the quakes left four locals dead, 79
others injured and more than 900 others with slight injuries.

<HEADLINE> Seismologists from Mainland to Attend Seminar in Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of 12 seismologists
from the Chinese mainland is to leave for Taiwan tomorrow for a
seminar on the exchange of seismological information and
cooperation across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The group will be led by He Yongnian, director of the Across-
Straits center for the exchange of seismological science and
technology, it was announced at a press conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
The seismological departments and experts on the mainland
concern themselves very much with the devastating earthquake that
rocked Taiwan on September 21 last year. Then, the center sent a
message of sympathy to its Taiwan counterpart shortly after the
quake occurred and offered to dispatch an expert group to Taiwan
to join their Taiwan colleagues in monitoring the aftershock
trends.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the current visit by the seismologists from the
mainland is to compare notes with their Taiwan colleagues on
seismological science and technology and learn from each other's
strong points in an effort to further lessen and even avoid the
losses to be caused by future possible earthquakes at both sides
of the Taiwan Straits to the minimum extent.
</P>
<P>
Members of the group include Chen Yuntai, an academician of the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), who is currently president of
the board of the Seismology Society of China, Xie Lili, an
academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), and
experts on quake analysis and forecast, anti-shock engineering and
engineering mechanics.
</P>
<P>
The seminar will run for two days and participants will go to
inspect the site of the recent quake after the seminar.

<HEADLINE> No Deal to Pardon Puppet Kuwaiti Leader: Sources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Al Aa Hussein, head of the
puppet Kuwaiti government set up by Iraq during its seven-month
occupation, has not been given any assurances that the death
sentence against him will be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers on Sunday quoted various sources as saying that
Al Aa, who voluntarily returned to Kuwait on Friday, will have a
fair trial "but he has not been given guarantees" that he will be
pardoned.
</P>
<P>
"He made the decision a while back to return to Kuwait but he
wanted to strike a deal with the authorities here. He has been
given no guarantees," one source said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Al Aa had contacted, through the
International Committee of the Red Cross, competent authorities in
Kuwait, which raised no objection to his return to the country. But
the claim was officially denied.
</P>
<P>
Another source said a fair trial could still result in a
decision to hang the 41-your-old traitor.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Al Aa's return will be discussed at a cabinet
meeting scheduled on Sunday, official media reported.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa, who carried a Norwegian travel document, arrived at the
Kuwaiti airport from Oslo, Norway, early Friday morning, when he
was arrested by state security and taken to the Central Prison. His
four children who traveled with him were handed over to their
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Press reports said that within a few days following the August
1990 invasion of Kuwait, Al Aa, once a young lieutenant in the
Kuwaiti army, along with eight other men who worked in the Ministry
of Defense, was taken to Iraq and placed under house arrest by
Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
It was announced by Iraq at the time that the eight men formed
the "provisional (Kuwaiti) government," headed by Al Aa.
</P>
<P>
After the liberation of Kuwait, the eight men were released at
the Kuwaiti border and each given 50,000 U.S. dollars by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As they said on their return that they were forced to cooperate
with the Iraqi regime, Kuwaiti legal authorities, which found their
claims genuine, acquitted them of any wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
But Al Aa was given a death sentence by a Kuwaiti court in 1991
on charges of high treason.
</P>
<P>
Al Aa's lawyer Khalid Al-Abdel Jaleel, who visited him at the
jail Saturday, said he was going to file an appeal against the
sentence in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Jaleel knew before hand the return of Al Aa and
arranged for his arrival.

<HEADLINE> Credit Rating to be Guided by Profitability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC), the country's major money supplier to its vast rural areas,
will continue to help the state optimize its agricultural
structure this year by shifting its credit focus to quality
clients and products.
</P>
<P>
The bank granted a total of 165.2 billion yuan (19.9 billion U.
S. dollars) in agricultural loans last year. Outstanding
agricultural loans were valued at 233.1 billion yuan (28.1 billion
US dollars), an 11.5 percent increase within the year, notes today
's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
"Total agricultural credit this year will definitely increase
based on last year's performance, but quality clients and high-
profit projects must claim precedence over all others in loan
granting to help optimize the overall agricultural structure,"
said Li Jianlin, director with the Agricultural Credit Division
under ABC's No.1 Credit Department.
</P>
<P>
The bank will rate all enterprise clients' credit during the
new year and group them as excellent, average and poor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank will adopt simplified and flexible methods
in granting loans to good clients.
</P>
<P>
This year, the ABC's agricultural credit service will continue
to follow state policy in readjusting the distribution of
agricultural plants and product structures.
</P>
<P>
The bank will give more support to high quality products while
reducing investment in inferior varieties, said Li.
</P>
<P>
To steer agricultural production toward economies of scale and
enterprise mechanisms, ABC will provide more credit to experienced
farmers, and rural specialized production bases.
</P>
<P>
Also on top of the bank's credit list are livestock farming and
rural small towns.

<HEADLINE> IMF Chief: Latin America Coming Out of Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 15 (Xinhua) -- International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Managing Director Michel Camdessus said Saturday that Latin
America is clearly "coming out of the crisis, despite the
circumstantial differences among the countries of the region,"
according to reports reaching here from Paris.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the main economic problems of Latin America,
Camdessus emphasized that it is now the right time to discuss the
positive evolution occurring in the region, saying "The world is
surprised by the results obtained in Brazil."
</P>
<P>
"When we launched last March the new economic program, trying
to convince Europeans that it would work, there was a lot of
skepticism. But we see that it works far better than expected,"
said the IMF chief.
</P>
<P>
"The Brazilian Parliament has passed the programs President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso launched. And I am confident that
Brazil will be able to grow at 4 percent."
</P>
<P>
"I could see the same with Argentina," said Camdessus, 70, who
will leave his post in February, one year before the end of his
third mandate at the head of the multinational organization.
</P>
<P>
"I am very impressed with the statements by President Fernando
de la Rua, of deepening the economic reforms. I was in Washington
last weekend discussing with the Argentine finance minister and we
could continue in the next three years our cooperation with that
country," said Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
He commented that "Chile is surmounting the serious recession
of last year and I think this country has all the needed elements
to forge ahead."
</P>
<P>
However, he said there are still serious economic problems in
Ecuador and Colombia, as well as in Venezuela, whose economic
development has been hit by natural catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation in Ecuador is very difficult and that the
plan to "dollarize" the economy promoted by President Jamil Mahuad
has both positive and negative aspects, and that it causes
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
"The decision adopted by Mahuad was a surprise even for me," he
said, adding that Ecuador is a member of the IMF, which has
decided to face the new situation created by that economic measure.
</P>
<P>
"I decided after talking with President Mahuad to send him some
technicians to see if we could help build a new program
sufficiently credible for themselves and for the international
community," said Camdessus.
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that Latin America has "a contrasting situation,"
but "we are at the exit of the crisis, which offers the new
governments an opportunity to accelerate the economic process,"
said Camdessus.

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Rate Falls to 2.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate
tumbled for the second consecutive week to 2.7 percent for the
week ending January 1, 2000, on account of a sharp decline in the
prices of primary articles including vegetables.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the 0.23 percentage
point fall in the annual inflation rate compared with 2.93 percent
in the previous week was triggered off by a 0.4 percent fall in
the primary articles index representing both food and non-food
articles.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate during the corresponding week in the
previous year was 5.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lower rate of inflation during the most part of 1999 was
mainly on account of a comparison with a higher base in 1998 when
overall prices were up following an abnormal increase in vegetable
prices.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Jets Purchase Gets US Congress Approval </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Congress has approved
a request of the Thai Air Force to purchasing 16 used F-16 A/B jet
fighters, The Bangkok Post reported here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The air force made the request in the middle of last year and
the U.S. Congress approved it on January 6, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Financial problem persists for the air force as it has only 133
million U.S. dollars in hand while the 16 aircraft will cost
around 157 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Of the 133 million dollars, the air force expects to get about
28 million dollars from selling back F/A-18 spare parts and there
is still 105 million dollars in deposit with the U.S. Federal
Reserve under the foreign military sales program, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
Top officers of the air force are expected to go to the United
States and try to bargain on the return of the spare parts up to
35 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The F-16s to be acquired each have 2,000-3,000 flying hours on
the clock, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
They will be upgraded before delivery and will be good for
another 4,000 flying hours, or a service life of about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The F-16s have beyond-visual-range capability and will be
equipped with advanced medium-range air-to-air missile systems and
Sparrow Aim-7 rockets.
</P>
<P>
The air force had planned to purchase a squadron of, or 16 to
18,F/A-18 jets from the United States but had to cancel the deal
two years ago due to financial difficulties.

TIANJIN -- U.S. oil company Kerr-McGee has pumped a high-yield
exploratory well in a block in north China's Bohai Bay, capable of
producing 395 cubic meters of crude oil per day.
</P>
<P>
 It is Kerr-McGee's first attempt made at drilling for oil in
block 04/36 in Bohai Bay. The oil rig is located in the western
part of the bay or more than 40 km off Tianjin's coastal area of
Tanggu. It is also the first time the U.S. firm has drilled for
oil in Bohai's shallow geological structures with depths ranging
from 900 m to 1400 m.
</P>

China's Bohai Petroleum Corporation and Phillips of the United
State had previously acquired high-yield oil streams from the
structures and discovered large offshore oilfields with an output
exceeding 100 million tons, such as Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Penglai
19-3. (China-Oil)

<HEADLINE> India Asks Pakistan to Extradite Hijackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 16 (Xinhua) -- India asserted Saturday that
the five hijackers of its aircraft were in Pakistan and asked
Islamabad to extradite them to India to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Secretary Lalit Mansingh summoned Pakistani High
Commissioner in New Delhi Ashraf Jehangir Qazi Saturday and
expressed the hope that Pakistan would "take necessary measures to
apprehend the hijackers" and "extradite them to India for
prosecution."
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded statement, the External Affairs Ministry
said Saturday night that this would be in fulfillment of Pakistan'
s legal obligations under the international conventions to which
it is a signatory.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani envoy, who was summoned to the ministry for the
first time since the end of the week-long hijacking drama on the
last day of last year in Afghanistan, was also told that India
reserved the right to take "further measures as appropriate," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
India has maintained that the five hijackers, allegedly
Identified following the arrest of their key accomplices last week
in India,appeared in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir after
the end of the hijacking.
</P>
<P>
"Given that a large number of terrorists whose release was
sought by the hijackers are Pakistani nationals and that the first
destination chosen by the hijackers was Lahore, there was strong
ground to believe that the hijackers were currently in Pakistan,"
the statement added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry told the media
here Saturday evening that India made the request for the
extradition of the hijackers only after studying the legal
implications of the issue.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Hold Referendum to Settle President-Parliament Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
decreed Saturday night a nationwide referendum on April 16 to help
settle disputes between the executive and legislative branches.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma said more than 3 million citizens have signed to call
for a referendum and in the plebiscite voters will be asked six
questions concerning the current parliament, according to reports
of the Interfax-Ukraine news agency.
</P>
<P>
Voters will be asked whether they have confidence in the
parliament; and if they do not, whether they would allow the
president to dissolve parliament.
</P>
<P>
They will vote on allowing the president to dissolve parliament
before the end of its term if parliament fails to form a majority
within one month or to pass the government budget within three
months.
</P>
<P>
They will also decide whether the members of parliament should
enjoy immunities, whether the number of MPs should be cut from 450
to 300, whether the parliament should be changed to a bicameral
body and whether the constitution should be amended and approved
via referendum.
</P>
<P>
Disputes between the Kuchma administration and the opposition-
led parliament have existed for eight years ever since Ukraine
announced independence from the ex-Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma often blames the legislative body for refusing to back
his economic reforms. He proposed a referendum soon after his re-
election last November for a second five- year term.

<HEADLINE> New Insurance Regulations Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign firms that want to
participate in China's insurance industry now have China Insurance
Regulatory Commission (CIRC) Guidelines to follow.
</P>
<P>
New regulations issued by the insurance industry watchdog
indicate foreign investors may hold as much as 25 percent share of
a local firm, according to today's "China Daily" Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-owned or overseas firms, which already hold shares
greater than 25 percent of insurance firms in China, must conform
to related foreign insurance company management supervision when
seeking investment.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is not applicable to insurance companies that
are qualified and permitted by the CIRC or the China Securities
Regulatory Commission for a listing.
</P>
<P>
Regulations permit local finance departments at various levels
to invest in insurance companies using their spare funds with
permission from their local governments and the CIRC. But it
forbids investments by banks, securities institutions, the
military, social groups and government-funded institutions.
</P>
<P>
The insurance companies referred to in the regulation are share-
holding firms with limited liabilities that are registered and
established in China.
</P>
<P>
The CIRC stipulates that all enterprises with legal person
status that have registered with industrial and commercial
administration departments can invest in insurance companies under
the condition that they have sound operation, make profits and,
that their net assets make up more than 30 percent of their total
assets.
</P>
<P>
Jointly-funded and operated enterprises can also invest in
insurance companies if they meet the above requirements. Wholly
foreign-owned companies and overseas companies are also eligible
to receive investments if permitted by CIRC, but the shares of any
single foreign shareholders should not exceed five percent of an
insurance company's total share value, a source said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Vows to Act Against Troublemakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President
Abdurrahman Wahid promised that he would act firmly against those
who had destroyed social order and caused the strife in Aceh,
Maluku and other provinces.
</P>
<P>
"We have been patient so far but we will take firm actions soon,
"Wahid was quoted by the Antara News Agency Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president said his government had always been serious in
dealing with the conflicts in Maluku as well as Aceh.
</P>
<P>
Maluku in the eastern part of the country has been the site of
bloody communal violence since January last year and about 1,130
people have died since then. Aceh, the country's westernmost
province, has been under fire since some people there raised the
demand for independence and separation from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri would visit
Maluku on January 24 while he himself would go to Aceh at the end
of the month.
</P>
<P>
He also asked the people in the troubled regions to forget the
tragedies they had experienced and try to think only of the future.
</P>
<P>
About his planned visits to 11 countries in Europe and Asia
later this month, the president said he would convince their
government leaders about the importance of letting Indonesia
remain united.

JERUSALEM -- Israel will postpone the third troop redeployment
from the West Bank scheduled on January 20, a senior Israeli
official said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is unlikely a redeployment will take place on Thursday
because the government and the Prime Minister have to make a
decision on it," Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran was quoted by
local media as saying.
</P>
<P>
Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat met in
Jerusalem earlier this week to discuss Israel's next troop
redeployment from the West Bank, but no agreement was reached.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Israeli prime minister's office said
Saturday,"Israel has decided to delay the withdrawal planned for
this week in the West Bank."
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Ehud Barak wants first to hear what Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat has to say during his meeting in Washington
with U.S. President Bill Clinton before deciding which zone to
pull out of," the spokesman added. (Israel-Redeployment)

MOSCOW -- Russian Federal forces liberated key south Chechen
district of Sharoi near the neighboring federal republic of

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Republican presidential candidates held
their final debate Saturday before the first caucuses in the 2000
campaign in Iowa State on January 24.
</P>
<P>
In the debate, Texas Governor George W. Bush, Republican front-
runner and commanding favorite in the Iowa polls, said that his
main rival John McCain's tax-cut plan would impose a 40 billion
dollars increase on working Americans.
</P>
<P>
Arizona Senator McCain shot back that Bush's proposal doesn't
leave money for Social Security, for Medicare and for paying down
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
McCain, who is debating but not competing in Iowa caucuses,
said his own tax plan would impose taxes on employer benefits for
workers, such as continuing education and transportation.
</P>
<P>
Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, Bush's closest challenger
in Iowa because of McCain's bypass strategy, also challenged Bush
on taxes.
</P>
<P>
"In Texas, George, your tax cuts are more apparent than real,"
Forbes said. "Most Texans have never seen those tax cuts." (US-

SANTIAGO -- Chile's former de facto military ruler Augusto
Pinochet could be back in this country next week, sources close to
the Pinochet family said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Logistic preparations are being made in London, where Pinochet
is detained since October 16, 1998, and also in Chile, for his
moving to this South American country, according to sources that
requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's personal doctor in Chile Henry Olivi and one of his
lawyers General Juan Carlos Salgado will travel to London Sunday,
as one of the preparations for his return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
British Home Secretary Jack Straw said on Tuesday that he
would not authorize Pinochet's extradition to Spain because the
former military ruler, 84 years old, could not resist a trial
because of his deteriorated health.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was detained in London at the request of Spanish
magistrate Baltasar Garzon, who plans to try him for the
assassination of opponents during the military regime in Chile of
1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
The former military ruler and lifetime senator will be
accompanied in his return to Chile by his wife, Lucia Hiriart,
announced sources close to the family. (Chile-Pinochet)

BUENOS AIRES, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Argentine soccer great
Diego Maradona is to go to Toronto, Canada to continue
rehabilitation from a drug habit that left him in the hospital
with serious heart damage 11 days ago, his doctor said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Maradona fell ill last week in Uruguay, suffering from
hypertension and an irregular heartbeat that doctors later
confirmed was directly linked to cocaine abuse dating back to 1983.
</P>
<P>
The former star has since been fed a steady diet of sedatives
to strengthen his heart tissue and relax his nerves.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Prices to be Steady on Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- An official with the State
Administration of Petroleum and Chemical Industry, named Chen
Yongwu, said his company can fully guarantee that the oil product
supply and prices will not go up sharply this year.
</P>
<P>
Chen confirmed the petrochemical sector has used less than 60
percent of its oil refining capacity, "China Daily" Business
Weekly reports today.
</P>
<P>
Chen's remarks were made after a shortage of oil products
emerged during the four quarter last year which led to price
increases.
</P>
<P>
The country's two oil giants, China Petro-chemical Corp (
SINOPEC) and the China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), have taken
emergency measures. They have ordered their provincial branches to
size up markets in a rapid way, and to redistribute oil products
among different regions swiftly.
</P>
<P>
To fill the market gap, the SINOPEC has suspended exports of
refined oil since the end of 1999. Regional government officials
have asked central authorities to lift a ban on imports of oil
products, which was put into practice 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
The shortage emerged suddenly just as China was moving towards
implementing a major tax reform. According to the reform, several
major taxes on motor vehicle owners are to be unified into a
single fuel tax.
</P>
<P>
To re-allocate oil resources nationwide, SINOPECT and CNPC,
which are rival firms, have firmly agreed to collaborate on the
measures. The two giants hold about 90 percent of the country's
total wholesale market for oil products.
</P>
<P>
SINOPECT and CNPC have launched investigations of their outlets
as well as other marketing units to explore and deal with hoarding
or illegal price gouging.
</P>
<P>
The current annual demand for oil products on China's domestic
market is nearly 170 million tons, while production capacity
amounts to some 260 million tons, Chen said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Kerr-McGee Finds Oil in North China Bay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. oil company Kerr-McGee has
pumped a high-yield exploratory well in a block in north China's
Bohai Bay, capable of producing 395 cubic meters of crude oil per
day.
</P>
<P>
 It is Kerr-McGee's first attempt made at drilling for oil in
block 04/36 in Bohai Bay. The oil rig is located in the western
part of the bay or more than 40 km off Tianjin's coastal area of
Tanggu. It is also the first time the U.S. firm has drilled for
oil in Bohai's shallow geological structures with depths ranging
from 900 m to 1400 m.
</P>
<P>
 The company started to work on the exploratory well, code-
named Caofeidian 11-1-1, on November 9 last year.
</P>
<P>
China's Bohai Petroleum Corporation and Phillips of the United
State had previously acquired high-yield oil streams from the
structures and discovered large offshore oilfields with an output
exceeding 100 million tons, such as Qinhuangdao 32-6 and Penglai
19-3.
</P>
<P>
 Kerr-McGee officials said that there are plans to make
further explorations in Bohai this year, on the 04/36 and 05/36
contractual blocks.
</P>
<P>
 Caofeidian 11-1-1 will create further opportunities for co-
operation between Chinese oil companies in exploring shallow
geological structures in the Bay, according to Chinese oil experts.
</P>
<P>
In joint oil exploration, a Chinese firm holds 51 percent of
its shares.

<HEADLINE> Qingdao City to Build Bridge Across Jiaozhou Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QINGDAO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- A four billion yuan (480
million US dollars) bridge project will be built to connect old,
new urban areas in Qingdao, a well-known port city in east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the project, which has been approved by the
State Council, or the central government, will begin in 2001.
Huangdao, the new urban area of Qingdao, also a world-renowned
tourist mecca, is separated from the city's old urban area by the
Jiaozhou Gulf.
</P>
<P>
It takes passengers about half an hour to cross the gulf by
ferry and has greatly restricted and hindered the city's
industrial development.
</P>
<P>
Bridge experts are still discussing the design of the bridge,
and pre-stage preparations will begin shortly. And the most
sophisticated technology in the world is to be introduced in
building the bridge.

<HEADLINE> Expert Predicts New Heights in Sino-EU Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The two-way trade between China
and the European Union (EU) is likely to reach new heights this
year, China Daily Business Weekly reported today, quoting a
Chinese trade expert.
</P>
<P>
The strong complementarity between China and the EU in
economic matters and the upbeat economic predictions for the EU
economy in 2000 will be the basis of the increase in bilateral
trade, said Li Huiying, a researcher from the Chinese Academy for
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Customs Statistics showed that the two-way trade between China
and the EU rose by 13.9 percent to 55.7 billion US dollars last
year. China's exports to the EU have been dominated by textiles
and machinery and electronics products with low added value, while
its imports from the EU are usually high-tech products and
industrial materials.
</P>
<P>
The EU has become China's largest high-tech provider since it
has advanced technologies in energy, environmental protection,
communications, chemicals, automobiles, electronics and
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the expert warned that EU's anti-dumping charges
against Chinese products are still "unpleasant overtones" in
bilateral economic development, which influenced about 300 million
US dollars worth of Chinese products involving steel, color
display tubes and bicycle components last year.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation between China and the EU on China's accession
to the World Trade Organization will also influence trade and
economic cooperation relations between the two sides, she said.

<HEADLINE> China to Import More Timber This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, January 16 (Xinhua) -- China may have to import 10
million cubic meters of timber this year due to increases markets
demands and nationwide ban on logging, according to today's China
Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
An insider is quoted as saying that imports this year will
likely increase by 12 percent over last year's. Ji Wei, president
of the Beijing Branch of the China National Timber Exchange Market
said that a nationwide ban on logging will be implemented this
year after 18 months of preparation.
</P>
<P>
For decades, China's forestry industry has engaged mainly in
logging, caring less for sustained forestry development, which
resulted in serious land erosion. After devastating floods that
occurred in 1998, the central government decided to ban logging in
major natural forests.
</P>
<P>
China is believed to have imported 8.9 million cubic meters of
timber last year, compared with 7 million in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Croatian striker Davor Suker and
Frenchman Thierry Henry both scored twice to give Arsenal a 4-1
victory over Sunderland at the English premier league on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Arsenal started the day in third just two points ahead of
fourth-placed Sunderland, who were promoted last season. The north
London club had been struggling with consistency with just one win
in their previous four league games.
</P>
<P>
But a third-minute goal from Frenchman Thierry Henry and two
excellent goals from Suker midway through the first half changed
the mood dramatically at Highbury. Henry showed composure for his
second goal in the 81st minute.
</P>
<P>
The victory kept the London club in third, level on points with
second-placed Manchester United and one point behind leaders Leeds

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Opposition Boycotts Chissano's Inauguration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's main opposition
party, the former rebel movement Renamo (Mozambican National
Resistance), and its allies boycotted Saturday's inauguration of
Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano.
</P>
<P>
Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama had vowed in advance that neither
he nor the 117 Renamo deputies in the Mozambican parliament would
attend Chissano' s inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the boycott is that Renamo is still claiming
that it won the general elections last December, and that Dhlakama
is the real president of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
When the National Elections Commission (CNE) on December 22
declared that Chissano and his ruling Frelimo party were the
victors, Renamo cried fraud, and appealed to the Supreme Court for
a recount of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court gave its ruling on January 4, validating the
results as given by the CNE. Since there is no appeal against a
Supreme court ruling, a recount is now legally out of the
question.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, Renamo continued to call for a recount, and said
it wants to negotiate the matter with Frelimo, But Frelimo leaders
have made it clear that there is nothing to negotiate.
</P>
<P>
Renamo is now threatening that if there is no recount it will
set up a government of its own in the six provinces where it won a
majority of votes.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Celebrate Armed Forces, Remembrance Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 15 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians Saturday marked the
Armed Forces and Remembrance Day, which coincided with the 30th
anniversary of the end of the Biafran War.
</P>
<P>
Highlights of this year's activities were prayers for peace and
unity at churches and mosques, and a parade by the Armed Forces at
the Remembrance Arcade in Abuja, the country's capital.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Atiku Abubakar reviewed the parade of 250
troops, and then laid a wreath at the tomb of the "Unknown
Soldier" on behalf of President Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
Other dignitaries, including top parliamentary leaders and
senior government official as well as the dean of the diplomatic
corps and selected widows of dead Nigerian armed forces personnel,
took their turns in laying wreaths.
</P>
<P>
The heroes and victims in the 1967-70 civil war were also
memorized during Saturday's events throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
About one million people died in that war against the Igbo
secessionists, who fought to set up their separate country in the
oil rich Niger delta.
</P>
<P>
The federal side finally won the war, in which President
Olusegun Obasanjo gained his fame as a miracle-making federal army
commander.

class".
</P>
<P>
"We must continue with our foreign policy of peace, friendship,

<HEADLINE> Congolese President Absent From Chissano's Inauguration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 15 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila of the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) failed to attend the
inauguration of Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambique News Agency, Foreign Ministry officials
said that they had expected Kabila to attend the ceremony, but did
not know why he had not arrived.
</P>
<P>
The only other Southern African Development Community (SADC)
member state not represented at the ceremony was Seychelles.
</P>
<P>
All the other heads of state deeply involved in the DRC
conflict were present - both those supporting Kabila's regime,
presidents Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Jose Eduardo dos Santos of
Angola and Sam Nujoma of Namibia, and those who back the rebels
trying to topple Kabila, namely presidents Yoweri Museveni of
Uganda and Pasteur Bizimungu of Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The absence of Kabila throws a shadow over the SADC
extraordinary summit which Chissano, as SADC chairman, has called
for Sunday to discuss the implementation of the ceasefire
agreement reached in Lusaka in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican officials were hopeful that Kabila might still
arrive on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
If no Congolese delegation arrives, it is difficult to see what
purpose the summit will serve.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanese Minister of Finance George Korom said the
total national revenues of his countries in 1999 went up by 5
percent to 4,868 billion liras (some 3.2 billion U.S. dollars)
compared to the previous year .
</P>
<P>
Korom was quoted by Sunday's issue of Al-Hayat daily as saying
that the total deficit in 1999 stood at 42.4 percent and the
budget deficit was 38 percent. The figures are less than the
prediction of 43 to 44 percent for total deficit and 40.3 percent
for
budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese minister expected that the results would benefit
the financial and retail markets.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the results to the record rise of 31.4 percent in
tax revenues in 1999.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Saudi Arabia car imports in 1998 are estimated at
154,742 cars while the total Arab car imports are put at 214,000
cars.
</P>
<P>
The recent figures issued by Saudi Arabian House of Consultation

Services in Jeddah said that Saudi Arabia car imports made a new
record high by growing 3 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese-made cars accounted for 50 percent of the total
car imports of Saudi Arabia followed by the U.S.-made cars, 36
percent, the German ones, 5 percent, and then the South
Korean, the Russian and the French cars.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has no plants for auto manufacturing, it has 169
automotive assembly factories out of 250 such factories in the
Persian Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
RABAT -- The European Union (EU) decided to grant Morocco 50
million Euros to boost its social and economic reforms, the
visiting delegation of the European Commission (EC) said.
</P>
<P>
EC sources were quoted by Sunday's economic daily Al-Alam Al-
Yom as saying that the grant was the largest of its kind to be
offered to Morocco as part of the EU efforts to step up the
latter's economic and social restructuring. Morocco started its
reforms in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The reforms will enable the north African country to develop a
free trade zone with Europe by 2010 in line with the EU-Moroccan
partnership agreement to be enforced soon, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The grant is the third instalment of a 120 million-Euro package
to enhance Morocco's economic restructuring operation.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Officials of Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey are due to
meet in Ankara on January 21-22 to discuss a price list in
connection with the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline project, reported the
Anatolia News Agency on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Having concluded his visit to Georgia, Turkish President
Suleyman Demirel told reporters aboard his special plane on
Saturday night, "This is not only an economic project, but a
prestige project."
</P>
<P>
Demirel said that the price list is the last one of the four
problems that needed to be solved. He added that all the obstacles
that lie on the way of the project will be removed in the Ankara
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Only Receives Half of Contracted Goods: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has so far only received
about half of contracted goods purchased under the oil-for-food
program, which are worth only 5.95 billion U.S. dollars, said Iraq
Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Saleh made the remarks when meeting with a Spanish delegation of
over 100 members who arrived in Baghdad Friday to voice solidarity
with the Iraqi people on the occasion of the 9th anniversary of the
outbreak of the Gulf War on January 17, 1991.
</P>
<P>
The minister said since the oil-for-food program started in
December 1996, Iraq has exported oil worth 18 billion dollars, and
has signed contracts worth some 12 billion dollars on purchasing
humanitarian supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added that the U.N. has taken over 6 billion
dollars from Iraq's oil revenues to finance its organizations and
their programs inside or outside Iraq, and for war reparations.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the minister said that Iraq's money is still being
used by the U.S. and British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions
Committee for putting on hold Iraq's contracts concluded with
foreign companies under the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said the electricity sector had only received 12 percent
of contracted items, irrigation sector 6 percent, higher education
13 percent, education 12 percent, oil sector 19 percent, drainage
and water refinement 18 percent, and the communication sector had
received nothing though it has signed contracts worth 205 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister described the Iraqi-Spanish economic relations
before the imposition of the embargo as wide and distinctive.
</P>
<P>
Though since the implementation of the oil-for-food program, the
trade transactions between Iraq and Spain has amounted to 159
million dollars, it does not satisfy the ambition of both
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that U.S. and British envoys at the Sanctions Committee
have suspended 53 million dollars worth of contracts Iraq inked
with Spanish companies.

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Calls for Talks with Greece on Aegean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem said Turko-Greek relations have so improved that the two sides
can now kick off talks on substantial problems such as Aegean Sea
sovereignty, the Anatolia News Agency reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cem said there is already good cooperation between Greece and
Turkey in many areas, setting a foundation for future relations.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey remains committed to solve all its differences with
Greece by peaceful means, the same as Greece wants to do," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cem made his remarks as his Greek counterpart George Papandreou
will visit Ankara January 19-20 to sign a number of agreements with
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers were considered the main architects of
a rapprochement between Turkey and Greece, which are NATO allies
but have been at odds for a long time over various issues including
Cyprus and borders in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries started talks on relatively non-
controversial issues last year and boosted relations by an
unexpected outpouring of public sympathy and support when both
countries suffered deadly earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Partly because of the new atmosphere, Greece lifted its
objections to acceptance of Turkey as a formal candidate for
European Union membership at an EU summit in Helsinki last
December.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that "I believe Turko-Greek relations have reached a
level of maturity for us to tackle the core issues."
</P>
<P>
It is expected that during Papandreou's visit, both sides will
sign agreements concerning tourism, fighting illegal immigration,
terrorism and cross-border crime, and economic, scientific and
technological cooperations.

JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua)-- Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdel Illah Al-Khatib starts a visit to Israel on Monday to hold a

Foreign Ministry said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers are to discuss the recent developments

</P>
<P>
Khatib hosted Minister of Culture and Information of the
Palestinian National Authority Yasser Abed Rabbo in Amman on
Sunday. They exchanged views on the peace process, particularly the
obstacles on the Palestinian-Israeli track after Israel decided to
delay the handover of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank
territories to full Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace deal signed last September, Israel has to carry

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister
Nikolai Koshman pledged Sunday to free the Chechen capital of
Grozny from militants by early February.
</P>
<P>
"By the dynamics that shaped today, this will apparently be so,
" Koshman, who is also the government's envoy to the breakaway
republic, said in an interview on the Zerkalo or Mirror television
program.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that part of the staff of the Russian government
envoy's office in Chechnya would soon be moved to Grozny soon.
</P>
<P>
"In three-four days, I will be able to say when we move there,"
he said, adding that once the city is cleared of rebels, "very
energetic measures on rendering aid to the civilian population"
will be required.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, part of the mission's staff has moved to Gudermes,
the second largest Chechen city. The entire staff "will be in
Gudermes" by Tuesday, Koshman said.
</P>
<P>
The move to Gudermes is intended to more effectively solve
social problems in the liberated Chechen areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, federal Air Force planes continued their assaults on
rebel positions mainly in the Shatoi, Itum-Kalin, and Vedeno
districts, as rebel commanders vowed to switch from position
fighting to guerrilla tactics, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But federal forces have formed special rapid reaction troops to
counter the rebels' guerrilla warfare. Overnight Sunday, the
special troops and elite OMON police defused 81 bombs, confiscated
204 kilograms of explosives, and detained seven Chechen fighters.
</P>
<P>
They also thwarted terrorist acts in several regions of
Chechnya, Interfax reported, citing the Russian Interior Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Italian Ruling Party Ends Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Left Democrat party's
leader Walter Veltroni concluded the party's congress in the
northwestern Italian city of Turin, telling delegates that their
party had re-discovered itself as a great political force and now
had to push forward towards a center-left federation.
</P>
<P>
In reply to opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi's accusation
that the congress had turned the Convention Center into a "Temple
of Hate," Veltroni said, "This has been anything but a Temple of
Hate, this has been a temple of political passion, for who see
politics not as a business but as a service to the nation?"
</P>
<P>
Centering his aim against the center-right, the Left Democrat
secretary added, "The time has come to set the record straight.
The aggressors cannot turn themselves into the victims. For a year
now we have been under constant attack by the Right."
</P>
<P>
What was important, Veltroni said, was to "re-open
confrontation with the Right, to bring out our differences,
because this pumps oxygen into democracy."
</P>
<P>
Veltroni received a standing ovation at the end of his address
and was immediately approached by Premier D'Alema, who later said,
"This was a good congress that showed that the party is united."
</P>
<P>
"Veltroni pulled the strings in the best way possible," he
added, "placing the emphasis on policy choices and the proposals
this congress has made to the nation and to the center-left
coalition."
</P>
<P>
The Left Democrat congress closed with a concert by British pop
star Sting.

<P>
ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy's biggest city of Milan
today enjoyed its first Sunday on foot since the days of the first
oil crunch in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a decree issued by the Lombardy regional government,
all private motor vehicles were banned from moving in the city
because of the high concentration of pollutants found in the
atmosphere recently.
</P>
<P>
The order, which also affects several other Lombard cities, was
applied in the last two days to all cars except those fitted with
catalytic converters.
</P>
<P>
But today even the owners of so-called "green" cars had to
leave them in the garage.
</P>
<P>
The only vehicles to be seen in the streets of the Lombard
capital were buses, trams, taxis, and a handful of electrically-
powered cars.
</P>
<P>
Regional President Roberto Formigoni, who got around the city
by bike and underground today, said there had been no alternative
to the order because of the level of smog.
</P>
<P>
"The concentration of dust was too high and dangerous for
people's health, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city's councilor for traffic, Giorgio Goggi, expressed the
view that the citizenry had "understood" why the city had to be
closed to traffic and had "appeared satisfied."

<HEADLINE> Turkish FM Calls for Expanded Dialogue With Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail
Cem Sunday urged Greece to enter into an expanded dialogue with
Turkey that will include Ankara's Aegean territorial claims.
</P>
<P>
Turkey had been resolutely seeking a solution to the Aegean
problems through peaceful means and calling for negotiations to
this end, he said in an interview published Sunday in the Athens
daily "To Vima."
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, Turkey and Greece should be ready to take up
all bilateral issues in a frank and open-minded manner to reach a
just and equitable solution in the Aegean," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the result of last month's EU Helsinki summit
provided a new impetus to attain that goal.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish minister also rejected U.N. resolutions and other
international calls for the establishment of a bizonal, bicommunal
federation on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cem said that the Cypriot government had no right to negotiate
EU accession for the entire island because there existed two
sovereign, independent states in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks in less than a week before Greek Foreign
Minister George Papandreou travels to Ankara for the signing of a
series of bilateral agreements and to discuss the future of the
recent Greek-Turkish rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have closely gone to war
three times in the past 25 years because of their disputes in the
territorial waters, air space limits and the delimitation of the
continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, and the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Last June, the two neighbors began several rounds of low-level
talks as part of their efforts to improve their strained relations,
and the outpouring of public sympathy and support during last year
's unexpected earthquakes in the two countries have boosted also
their relations.
</P>
<P>
While hoping to better its ties with Turkey, Greece has
steadfastly refused to discuss with Turkey issues of sovereignty
and territorial rights in the Aegean.

<HEADLINE> Hawkish New Israeli Central Bank Governor Marginally Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- David Klein, an advocate of
tight monetary policies and thus a controversial nominee for
governor of the Bank of Israel, won the cabinet approval by a
narrow margin on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet scheduled to vote on the nomination on Sunday
morning but had to extend the meeting to late evening because of
some ministers' firm opposition to Klein, who was nominated by
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak ten days ago.
</P>
<P>
The final vote was 10 for, seven against, and five abstentions,
according to a statement issued by Israeli Government Press Office.
</P>
<P>
Three ministers from the ruling Labor party, including Finance
Minister Abraham Shohat, abstained in the vote because of Klein's
hawkish reputation of tight monetary philosophies.
</P>
<P>
Shohat's abstention marked the first time in Israel's history
that a finance minister did not endorse a prime minister's
candidate for the bank governor.
</P>
<P>
Seven Ministers from the ultra-Orthodox Shas and the left-wing
Meretz parties, who believed klein's economic policies will
suffocate the newly-born economic recovery and hurt the poor and
unemployed Israelis, reportedly voted against the nomination.
</P>
<P>
Klein, 64, currently head of the monetary division in the
central bank, will succeed former governor Jacob Frenkel, who
announced his resignation on November 15 last year and stepped down
last Sunday after eight and a half years in the governor's chair.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel's tight monetary policy was blamed by some economists as
the main cause of three years of economic sluggishness in Israel
between 1996 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
However, Klein, the effective No.2 in the Bank of Israel, is
widely regarded as a Frenkel-clone who will take even tighter
monetary policies than Frenkel's.
</P>
<P>
From 1959 to 1966, Klein worked in the Budgets Department of the
Finance Ministry. From 1966 to 1972, he worked at the International
Monetary Fund in Washington.
</P>
<P>
He began his career at the Bank of Israel in 1987 and has served
as head of the monetary department, controller of foreign exchange,
and as the bank's representative on the board of directors of the
Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.
