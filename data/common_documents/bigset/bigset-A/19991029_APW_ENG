<HEADLINE> Block on EPA Pollution Rules Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court on Friday reaffirmed a  
decision blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing 
tougher air pollution controls on smog and soot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a split ruling, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia rejected the government's appeal and kept in 
place a decision in May by a three-judge panel from the court 
overturning the new pollution regulations imposed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials said the Justice Department is  
expected to take the case to the Supreme Court with hopes of a 
decision by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the appeal process moves forward, we will continue to  
pursue all available actions to secure cleaner air for the American 
people,'' EPA Administrator Carol Browner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton in 1997 directed the EPA to issue the tougher  
air rules, which require states to meet more stringent reductions 
in smog-causing ozone and in microscopic soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The smog and soot regulations were among the most controversial  
ever issued by Browner and drew strong opposition from business and 
industry groups. Environmental and many health experts argued the 
more stringent controls on soot and smog were needed to protect 
children and people with respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	But in May, a three-judge panel of the appeals court decided 2-1  
to overturn the regulation, saying the EPA had failed to justify 
the pollution levels it selected. The panel also said the soot rule 
was an ``unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority'' 
under the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, five judges on the full 11-member appeals court  
supported the EPA, while four upheld the lower court decision, and 
two did not take part. A majority of the full court was needed to 
approve the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups, which had filed the lawsuit challenging the  
regulations, applauded the decision by the full court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a victory for all businesses and a blow to the EPA,''  
said Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Once 
again the court agreed with American business that the EPA 
standards were pulled out of thin air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browner said that while she was ``disappointed'' by the full  
appeals court decision, ``we are encouraged that five of the nine 
judges agreed with the EPA argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency intends to ask the Justice Department to take the  
case to the Supreme Court as quickly as possible, with hopes that 
it could be heard during the court's spring session next year, 
agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised air standards imposed by the EPA in 1997 limited  
ozone, an essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, 
instead of 0.12 parts per million under the previous requirement. 
For the first time they also required that states regulate 
microscopic particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and 
other sources down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the 
width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups waged an intense battle against the regulation  
before they were issued in 1997, arguing they were too costly and 
not grounded in adequate science. Later, a broad cross-section of 
groups representing the trucking, utility, chemical, oil and auto 
industries, as well as small businesses, challenged the rules in a 
lawsuit. Three states -- Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia -- also 
joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Browner announced the EPA was reimposing the old ozone  
standard, while the litigation proceeds on the new standard. If the 
tougher air requirements are killed, ``125 million Americans, 
including 35 million children, will breathe air that doesn't meet 
health standards based on modern science,'' Browner has argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing the dissent, Judge David Tatel said in Friday's ruling  
that the three-judge panel's decision in May departed ``from a 
half-century of Supreme Court separation of powers jurisprudence'' 
and stripped the EPA of its ability to implement the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatel also had dissented in the May 14 decision.

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttle Atlantis Damaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Technicians preparing space shuttle  
Atlantis for a flight next March have inadvertently damaged the 
ship's wing flaps, NASA said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The technicians were testing the inboard elevons on Atlantis'  
wings late last week when they heard a noise, said NASA spokesman 
Joel Wells. They discovered the push rods on the flaps, or elevons, 
had been bent and some panels damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the damaged parts must be replaced.  
</P>
<P>
	Although the mishap still is being investigated, NASA believes  
the technicians failed to release small doors before moving the 
elevons, Wells said. That apparently caused the damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantis is supposed to haul supplies to the international space  
station in March, a month later than planned because of ongoing 
wiring inspections. All four shuttles have been checked for 
defective wiring since a short circuit marred Columbia's launch in 
July. The repairs to the damaged flaps should be done well before 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too early to speculate whether Atlantis' flight will be  
further delayed because of this week's failed launch of a Russian 
Proton rocket, said James Hartsfield, another NASA spokesman. The 
same kind of rocket will be used to launch Russia's long-delayed 
service module, which contains the space station's life-support 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
	The service module must be attached to the orbiting station

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Tax Break Continuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Senate voted across party lines to  
extend tax breaks for business, House Democrats criticized the 
Republican-run Congress for burying gun control, campaign finance 
overhaul and other initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who get the real treats are corporations and the  
wealthy, from lavish tax breaks to legislation that is killed on 
their demand,'' House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said Friday. 
He spoke against a backdrop of mock headstones to legislation 
``killed'' by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Budget negotiations have overtaken most other legislative  
business, and Gephardt, D-Mo., argued that Republicans have 
transformed the annual ritual into ``a pointless, endless 
process.'' Republicans countered they believe the budget can be 
finished by Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, meanwhile, signed another temporary spending  
bill that will keep the government operating for a week while 
negotiations continue over remaining appropriations for the fiscal 
year that began Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress still can't pass a budget because they can't figure  
out what to do,'' Clinton said during a speech in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders and committee chairmen responded to the Democrats'  
complaints with lists of legislative accomplishments this year, 
including a 4.8 percent pay raise for military personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats may want to pretend these accomplishments don't  
exist,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said in a 
statement. ``Working men and women across America are seeing the 
benefits of a Republican Congress -- a strong economy, low inflation 
and modern technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the maneuvering is a fierce fight for control of the  
House in an election still a year away. Republicans hold a 222-211 
majority, the party's slimmest since retaking control in 1995 for 
the first time in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In a voice vote Friday, the Senate passed an $8.5 billion bill  
that would extend a dozen expiring tax breaks to certain 
businesses. The House has yet to act on its version, which would 
cost nearly three times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version would extend several business tax credits  
through Dec. 31, 2000, including a research and development credit 
that expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican leaders said they thought the parties  
could resolve their differences on the budget by Nov. 10, just 
before lawmakers begin a Veterans Day recess. But after a strategy 
session Friday involving Gephardt and top White House officials, 
Democrats seemed less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly possible, but there are a lot of important  
issues to get through,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta 
said in an interview. ``We're interested in substance, not 
timing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agreements have yet to be worked out, for example, on Clinton's  
proposals for money to hire thousands of teachers and to purchase 
new parklands. But for all of the rhetoric, the budget differences 
between the administration and the Republicans are relatively minor 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the five remaining spending bills that have been vetoed or  
face veto threats, the money that Clinton wants is under $5 billion 
more than what Congress provided. Many of the remaining fights are 
over who should control federal dollars, not over killing programs, 
as in the first year of the GOP's congressional majority in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Arizona State Tailback Is Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona State tailback J.R. Redmond was suspended  
by the NCAA for Saturday's game against Oregon as the result of a 
bizarre situation that involved his marriage to a student who 
worked part-time in the Sun Devils' athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond also must repay the woman involved $418 in cellular  
telephone bills and $173 for a plane trip to Las Vegas last month 
plus perform 20 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond subsequently has filed for divorce from the woman, whose  
name was not made public by the university. The woman reportedly is 
seeking a share of Redmond's future earnings as part of the divorce 
settlement, athletic department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond's future earning potential is considerable, since he is  
a top NFL prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona State's appeal of the one-game suspension was denied by  
the NCAA on Friday, which led to the situation being made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond did not accompany the team to Eugene, Ore., but would  
have flown there and played if the appeal had been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	The university, in consultation with the Pac-10 Conference,  
reported the matter to the NCAA when the situation came to light 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Concerns arose related to who is permitted to provide benefits  
to a student-athlete,'' ASU athletic director Kevin White said in a 
statement. ``Therefore, the conference and the institution reviewed 
the direct relationship of the parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the institution's information, the NCAA determined  
that the benefits did not come from an approved source.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the university's report to the NCAA, Redmond  
developed a relationship with the female student who was a 
part-time athletic department worker, and she allowed him to use 
her cellular phone. After he made several calls, she told him that 
what he had done violated NCAA rules and the only way he could 
rectify the matter was to marry her, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic department officials said Redmond married the student  
on Aug. 25, and the couple flew to Las Vegas for the honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
	When word of the arrangement reached athletic department  
officials this week, the investigation began. The part-time worker 
submitted her resignation to the athletic department on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The university investigated a report that the woman had done a  
paper for one of Redmond's classes. While she may have typed the 
paper, there was no evidence she composed it, and it wasn't part of 
the violation that resulted in the NCAA penalty, athletic 
department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, a senior, was mentioned as a possible Heisman Trophy  
contender before the start of each of the last two seasons but has 
been slowed by injuries. He is fourth on Arizona State's career 
rushing list with 2,684 yards and 28 touchdowns in 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he has rushed for 739 yards, averaging 5.1 yards  
per carry. Last week, he carried a career-high 35 times for 165 
yards in the Sun Devils' victory over Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletic department said Redmond would not comment on the  
situation under advice from his lawyer because of the pending 
divorce proceeding. Redmond missed a practice this week because of 
a migraine headache.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes for Hate-Crimes Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Frustrated by two years of failure, President  
Clinton made an impassioned plea Friday night for Congress to pass 
a new hate-crime law to combat violence prompted by a victim's 
sexual orientation, gender or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate crimes victimize not only the victim but they victimize  
society as a whole in a special way,'' the president said, 
``because they contradict the very idea of America we are trying to 
build.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He turned for support to the Anti-Defamation League, the Jewish  
advocacy group that has been waging its own battle against 
anti-Semitic violence and the spread of hate groups. The president 
spoke at ADL's annual national commission dinner after a day of 
political speeches and fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to stand against manifestations of our inhumanity and  
we need to do more to reaffirm our common humanity,'' the president 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that if he could give America just one gift, it  
would be ``the ability to be one America, to bridge all divides. 
...We still can't form a society where no one hates anybody else 
because they're different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has labeled hate crimes ``the biggest challenge'' facing  
the nation and the world and has been crusading for legislation 
since November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, by unanimous vote, approved a hate-crimes prevention  
bill in July, but the measure stalled in the House. Earlier this 
week, Clinton vetoed a spending bill for the Commerce, Justice and 
State departments because it failed to include a Senate-passed 
hate-crimes provision. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure Clinton is pushing would add crimes motivated by  
sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list of hate 
crimes already covered by federal law -- those motivated by race, 
religion, color or national origin. Inclusion in the law means 
harsher penalties for violators and gives federal prosecutors the 
option of stepping in if local authorities decline to press 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican leaders contend such legislation is repetitive and  
refuse to include it in spending bills. ``A crime is a crime,'' 
House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Flying here from a speech in Philadelphia, Clinton called  
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and President Robert Kocharian of 
Armenia. Clinton expressed condolences to the Armenian leader for 
the assassination of Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian and said the 
United States will continue to support efforts for reform and 
stabilization. 
</P>
<P>
	With Mubarak, Clinton discussed meetings next week in Norway  
about the Middle East peace process with Israeli Prime Minister 
Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	To support Clinton's legislative campaign, the White House cited  
FBI figures that 8,000 hate crimes were reported last year. Nearly 
two-thirds of such offenses since 1991 were motivated by racial 
bias. ``All Americans deserve protection from hate,'' Clinton said 
earlier this year in one of more than 20 appeals he's made for a 
hate-crimes bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's message had a special resonance with the ADL audience.  
The group included Dr. Michael Messing, fired upon this summer as 
he walked home from a Chicago synagogue with his 16-year-old son. 
The gunman, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, missed but went on to kill 
two people and wound nine others, all members of various ethnic 
groups, during a shooting spree in Illinois and Indiana. Smith 
later killed himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Smith's rampage, declared white supremacist Buford Smith  
is accused of wounding five people, including three children, in a 
shooting spree at a Los Angeles Jewish community center in August. 
He also faces attempted murder charges for that attack and is 
charged with the murder of a Filipino-American postman the same 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his ADL speech, the president helped raise cash in  
Atlanta for the Democratic National Committee at a $5,000-a-couple 
dinner. The event, where guests dined on tenderloin and salmon, was 
expected to bring in $300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	He used the occasion to discuss his administration's  
achievements and goals and to criticize Republicans for denying 
money for Middle East peacemaking, to pay the U.S. debt to the 
United Nations, to destroy Russian nuclear warheads and for other 
foreign policy initiatives. ``Some of them really think that the 
only thing we've got to do is build a bigger bomb and a bigger wall 
and we'll be fine because the Cold War is over,'' Clinton said. ``I 
think that is nuts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Clinton spoke at a get-out-the-vote rally in  
Philadelphia for Democratic mayoral candidate John Street, who is 
in a close race with Republican Sam Katz, a businessman.

<HEADLINE> Ricky Martin Urges End to Navy Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rican pop star Ricky Martin  
has a message for President Clinton: Stop bombing runs on the 
territory's island of Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	``Puerto Rico is united in this cause and I'm part of it,''  
Martin said in Friday's El Mundo newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' singer has a tentative meeting  
scheduled next week with Clinton when he is in Washington for a 
benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy owns two-thirds of Vieques, a tiny island off the  
eastern coast of Puerto Rico. The military has conducted exercises 
using live bombs and other artillery on Vieques for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the bombing intensified in April when a Marine  
Corps jet dropped two bombs off target and killed a civilian 
security guard. Exercises were suspended after protesters set up 
camps on the range.

seven years, lacks vision and charisma. But the president said 
Street and outgoing Mayor Ed Rendell produced seven balanced 
budgets in a row as jobs grew and crime and welfare rolls declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a young, vigorous, brilliant, committed public  
servant,'' Clinton said of Street. But the president credited Katz 
with running an adroit campaign and said the Republican ``sang a 
good song. ... I compliment him, my hat's off to him. And I know 
something about singing a good song. I've sung a few myself over 
the years. But in the end, ... what matters is, can you stand and 
deliver.''

<HEADLINE> Interpublic Combines Two Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Interpublic Group of Cos. Inc. is combining two  
of its global advertising agencies into a single agency network 
that will rank among the top five in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammirati Puris Lintas, which creates ads for clients such as  
Burger King, Dell Computer, Unilever's Bird's Eye vegetables and 
Nestle Crunch candy bars, is merging with Lowe &AMP; Partners 
Worldwide, whose clients include Coca-Cola's Sprite, General 
Motors' Opel cars and Gillette's Braun shavers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal disclosed Friday, the combined agency will handle  
advertising billings of more than $11 billion. Ad billings are what 
advertisers spend on placing its ads on TV, newspapers and other 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Geier Jr., chairman and chief executive of Interpublic,  
said the merger creates an agency large enough handle the needs 
companies that are expanding globally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a much more powerful force in the marketplace''  
than either of the agencies were separately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said the new agency will have access to more  
resources that can be invested in training employees and investing 
in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency network will be called Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners  
Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be headed by Frank Lowe as chairman and chief executive  
and Michael Sennott as deputy chairman. Lowe has been head of The 
Lowe Group which oversaw Lowe &AMP; Partners, while Sennott has been 
vice chairman of McCann-Erickson WorldGroup, part of another ad 
agency network owned by Interpublic. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Puris, the chairman, chief executive and chief creative  
officer at Ammirati, is resigning from the agency and from 
Interpublic's board. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in a statement that while he felt it would be ``a  
brilliant idea'' to combine the agencies, he did not want to stay 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``One merger in a lifetime is enough,'' Puris said in the  
statement, referring to the 1995 combination of the agency he 
founded nearly 25 years ago, Ammirati &AMP; Puris, with Interpublic's 
Lintas Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Puris said he was ``an entrepreneur at heart'' and hoped to  
something involving the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A creative star, he has been credited with coining the themes  
``The Ultimate Driving Machine'' for BMW and ``The Antidote to 
Civilization'' for Club Med in his early days at Ammirati &AMP; Puris. 
</P>
<P>
	Interpublic is a holding company for advertising and marketing  
services companies. In addition to the Lowe, Ammirati and 
McCann-Erickson ad agencies, it owns the media buying service 
Western Initiative Media Worldwide, the sports marketing concern 
Octagon and International Public Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammirati is the larger of the two agencies at the moment with  
$7.7 billion in billings and 9,800 employees. Lowe &AMP; Partners 
handles billings of $4.4 billion and employs about 3,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Geier said he was hopeful the combined  
agency would not have to resign any accounts because of conflicts. 
He declined to identify any rival brands that would now find 
themselves with the same ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there would be any job cuts, he said there are ``always  
some efficiencies when you put two agencies together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said both agencies have unfilled positions and said  
``there is not going to be that many'' jobs that will be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency network would rank fourth among the U.S.-based ad  
agency networks in terms of billings, according to figures compiled 
by the trade magazine Advertising Age. 
</P>
<P>
	The three larger agency networks are McCann-Erickson Worldwide,  
which had $16.2 billion in billings last year, followed by DDB 
Needham Worldwide at $12.8 billion and Young &AMP; Rubicam at $12.6 
billion, Ad Age said.

<HEADLINE> Coffee, Soybeans Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices rose Friday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade after forecasts called for a dry weekend in parched 
growing regions of Brazil. Grains were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, coffee prices also rose and natural gas  
futures prices dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices, lagging near two-month lows, also were boosted  
by a long-rumored U.S. export sale to China and a possible one to 
Taiwan. China's northern Shandong province purchased 50,000 tons of 
U.S. soybeans and traders said there were rumors of more Chinese 
purchases coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures remained steady wheat was pressured by rain that  
improved crop conditions in Argentina and forecasts of increasing 
precipitation in the U.S. winter wheat belt this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.55 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn was unchanged at $1.99 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cent to $1.10 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 3/4 cents to 
$4.70 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	December coffee rose 3.80 cents to 100.50 cents per pound on New  
York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, also due to dry-weather 
forecasts for Brazil's coffee areas and concerns of heavy 
rainstorms headed into Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil's coffee-growing areas have been suffering a drought for  
about seven or eight months, pushing prices higher, said analyst 
Jack Scoville of Price Futures Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a result, prices that were 80 cents month or so ago are now  
a buck,'' he said. ``(Investors) sold off when forecasts called for 
rain, but now the forecasts turned dry. It has changed the 
sentiment of the market from one of plentiful supply to one of less 
supply than originally perceived.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices settled down 0.4 cent to $2.961 per 1,000  
cubic feet Friday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, stabilizing 
somewhat after Thursday's plunge of 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the trading was follow-through selling after Thursday's  
dropoff, said Bill O'Grady of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	But the short-term weather outlook continues to be a focus. New  
six-to-10-day forecasts show temperatures in the first week of 
November will be higher than average across most of the continental 
United States., likely resulting in lower demand, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen so much volatility in the market this week that  
other than to recommend keeping your seatbelt fastened, it's hard 
to tell what to do with this market,'' said Tim Evans of Pegasus 
Econometric Group. 
</P>
<P>
	December crude rose 7 cents to $21.75 a barrel; November heating  
oil fell .30 cents to 57.70 cents a gallon and November unleaded 
gasoline rose 1.77 cents to 63.93 cents a gallon.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Up on Chinese Purchase / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures prices rose today in early  
dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade on news that China had 
purchased 50,000 tons of U.S. soybeans. Grains were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors that China was in the market for U.S. soybeans had driven  
the price temporarily higher earlier this week. The speculation was 
confirmed overnight with word that China's northern Shandong 
province had purchased the large shipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said talk that China might buy more soybeans also was  
supporting the price. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures were trading steady amid mixed forecasts concerning  
crop prospects in South America. A drying trend is expected in 
Brazil over the next week, while concerns about dryness in northern 
Argentina were alleviated by overnight rains. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat dipped lower after rain improved crop conditions in both  
the U.S. winter wheat belt and in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 2 cents to $2.55 1/4 a bushel;  
December corn was unchanged at $1.99 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cent to $1.10 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 1 cent to $4.66 3/4 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures both were trading higher on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle rose .20 cent to 71.65 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle rose .37 cent to 80.77 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs rose .55 cent to 46.50 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies rose 1.10 cent to 62.25 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Surf Shop Sues Laura Schlessinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The owner of a surf shop has  
countersued radio talk show host Dr. Laura Schlessinger for 
slander. 
</P>
<P>
	The radio therapist sued Tom Moore, owner of the  
California-based Beach Access chain, after he said she lied when 
she told her audience he put pornography on his store's racks in 
front of children. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore has filed a $4 million counter-lawsuit, alleging she  
painted him in a false light and intentionally harmed his business. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlessinger, known as ``Dr. Laura,'' told her audience two  
months ago that Moore was guilty of putting pornography -- Big 
Brother Skateboarding magazine -- on its racks in front of children. 
The magazine is aimed primarily at teen-age boys, and in some 
issues runs sexually graphic and sometimes violent stories. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore pulled the magazine and asked for a retraction. The talk  
show host refused and filed the libel suit.

<HEADLINE> RNC Spends $1M in State Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee has  
contributed more than $1 million in the last two months to help 
elect state and local candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the money went into Mississippi, where former Rep. Mike  
Parker is the GOP nominee for governor against Democratic Lt. Gov. 
Ronnie Musgrove. In August and September, the RNC gave $545,000 to 
Parker's campaign; $25,000 to Bill Hawks, the Republican nominee 
for lieutenant governor; and $68,000 to the Mississippi Republican 
Party, Federal Election Commission records show. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall's off-year elections serve as appetizers for the full  
plate of races in 2000, where the White House and Congress will be 
up for grabs. State legislators elected then will redraw 
congressional district lines after the census. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a chance to continue the gains that Republicans have made  
on the state and local level and it's a chance to build momentum 
for the 2000 election,'' said RNC spokesman Bill McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Governors' Association executive director Clinton Key  
said the national GOP since has given another $155,000 to Parker's 
campaign. The Mississippi governor's race is the only one this year 
without an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got an open Republican seat in Mississippi,'' Key said.  
``That's a critical race in terms of the impact it's going to have. 
We feel that the governors from around the country have a 
tremendous impact on policy and politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the money spent in Mississippi, the Republican  
National Committee gave $150,000 to the political action committee 
of GOP Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, who is trying to help Republicans 
capture control of the commonwealth's General Assembly and thus 
control of reapportionment. And the RNC gave $300,000 to the 
gubernatorial campaign of Rep. Jim Talent of Missouri, though his 
race isn't until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee also has been  
active locally. The DSCC contributed $125,000 to a Virginia 
Democratic committee; $10,000 to the Democratic Legislative 
Campaign Committee, which aides local candidates; $35,000 to seven 
Virginia state legislative candidates; and $201,000 to 54 state and 
local Democratic candidates in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Money raised by the national parties for state races is soft  
money, which is not subject to federal contribution limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee and the Democratic and  
Republican congressional committees do not file disclosure reports 
with the FEC until next January, and their spending in state races 
was unavailable. The National Republican Senatorial Committee did 
not report any contributions to state parties or candidates in 
August or September.

<HEADLINE> Andy Williams Cancels Performances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- Swollen vocal chords have forced Andy  
Williams to cancel nearly a month of performances for the first 
time in his 63-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just unheard of,'' said Williams' spokesman, Tennyson  
Flowers. ``He has literally had to cancel maybe a dozen shows, 
maybe one day here or there, since he started performing as a 
child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 71, has done Christmas shows in Branson since 1993,  
but is canceling this year because of doctor's orders to refrain 
from talking or singing. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer is in good health, but has swollen vocal chords  
following a bout with laryngitis that has plagued him since 
September, Flowers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams has asked Pat and Debby Boone, the father-daughter pop  
duo, to fill in for him next month. He hopes to return to the stage 
in December.

<HEADLINE> Pamela Anderson Back With Tommy Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A year and a half after her breakup with rocker  
Tommy Lee, Pamela Anderson Lee says being back home with him is not 
``all roses,'' but is ``not a dangerous situation'' either. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson left her husband in 1998 after a highly-publicized  
fight. Lee pleaded no contest to kicking his then-estranged wife 
several times during a fight while she held their toddler son, 
Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the issue of ``Jane'' magazine set to hit newsstands next  
month, the former ``Baywatch'' beauty says Lee is learning to 
communicate better, in part through anger management classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all roses or anything, because there's a lot of pain  
that Tommy and I need to resolve,'' she says. ``But seeing my two 
little boys so happy and playing with their daddy, it's just 
beautiful to have our family back together.''

<P>
	The Canadian singer was often described that way when her album

<HEADLINE> City Salutes World Champion Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's No. 1 New York Yankees booster is  
hinting again that skipping school today to attend a victory parade 
for the World Series champions wouldn't be such a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me that this would make an excellent school trip,  
writing assignment,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday as he 
announced plans for the city's third ticker-tape parade for the 
Yankees in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees clinched a record 25th World Series title Wednesday  
night at Yankee Stadium, sweeping the Atlanta Braves in four 
straight games -- the second straight year the Bronx Bombers have 
gone unbeaten in the Fall Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Yankees supporters were expected to jam  
lower Broadway for the parade, which was to start at noon, followed 
90 minutes later by an invitation-only rally at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew warned students  
considering an unauthorized day off for the parade that ``tomorrow 
is a school day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five city high schools plan to send their marching bands,  
however: James Madison, Susan Wagner, Fort Hamilton, Tottenville 
and Curtis. Also scheduled to perform is the All City High School 
Marching Band, made up of students from throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said 3,500 officers would be  
assigned to the parade, and more would be added if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Admission to the City Hall rally was limited to 5,000 invited  
guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporting a blue Yankees hat and jacket during Thursday's press  
conference, Giuliani could not resist taking a swipe at Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, his all-but-declared rival for a U.S. Senate seat 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would invite Mrs. Clinton to the parade and rally,  
Giuliani responded: ``I guess, but she might show up in Chicago or 
something, I don't know. I honestly looked last night for her at 
the game, and I couldn't ... maybe she'll show up for tonight's 
game. There will be a lot of seats for tonight's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani paused, then said, he was ``just kidding around, like  
fellow Yankee fans (do).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, at a White House ceremony to toast the  
Yankees' 1998 World Series title, Mrs. Clinton declared she was a 
lifelong Yankees fan, although in the past she'd said that she was 
a diehard Chicago Cubs loyalist. 
</P>
<P>
	She explained that in the American League, the Yanks are her  
favorite, while her hometown Cubs are tops in her heart among 
National League clubs.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Patient Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed regulations  
to keep electronic medical records from the prying eyes of 
employers, marketers and others, and urged Congress to take further 
steps to safeguard patients' most sensitive information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please help protect American families from new abuses of their  
privacy,'' Clinton said during an Oval Office ceremony. ``Every 
American has a right to know his or her medical records are 
protected at all times from falling into the wrong hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal would apply to all electronic medical records  
and to all health plans. He said the technology has been wrongfully 
exploited by employers and marketing firms with a scrutiny like 
that of Big Brother in George Orwell's futuristic novel, ``1984.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are concerned, and rightfully so,''  
Clinton said. ``Americans should never have to worry that their 
employers are looking at the medicines they take, or the ailments 
they've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations, administration officials said, would  
restrict the use and release of private health information 
transmitted or maintained by computers. Congress debated the issue 
for years, but failed to meet a self-imposed Aug. 21 deadline for 
legislating new protections. Clinton said lawmakers should still 
seek to pass legislation, in order to cover records kept on paper. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Congress should act,'' Clinton said. ``There are  
still protections, some of them, we can give our families only if 
there's an act of Congress passed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Existing laws protecting medical privacy vary widely from state  
to state. Currently, there are no federal guarantees that private 
information won't be passed to employers, sold to pharmaceutical 
companies or talked about in insurance company offices. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration will publish the proposal next week for  
review. It has until February 2000 to issue a final proposal, with 
the rules to take effect in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The new federal rules would go beyond the weaker protections of  
some states, but would not override those with more restrictive 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules would apply only to electronic information, including  
computer records that have been copied to paper. 
</P>
<P>
	Only congressional action can protect the large amount of  
medical information that has existed only on paper, said Sen. 
Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who wrote a bipartisan privacy bill 
before the August deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can only hope that the administration's action will light a  
fire under Congress, so that we can deal with this critically 
important issue in a serious, bipartisan and comprehensive way,'' 
he said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, doctors, hospitals or health plans would not  
release a patient's information for purposes unrelated to treatment 
and payment without written consent. Private information can now be 
released to financial institutions, direct marketing firms and 
others without a patient's knowledge or consent. 
</P>
<P>
	When required to release medical information, health  
organizations would have to limit the disclosure to the minimum 
necessary for each case instead of a patient's entire record. For 
example, when paying for medical services, no treatment information 
would be sent to banks or credit card companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would create new civil and criminal penalties for  
improperly disclosing patient information. Intentionally releasing 
information would be punishable by a fine of up to $50,000 and one 
year in jail. Someone trying to sell information could face a 
$250,000 fine and 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients also would be given the right to see and copy their  
medical records and to request corrections of any errors. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new rules, law enforcement organizations would be  
prohibited from obtaining medical records without legal 
authorization like a warrant or court order. This retreats from the 
administration's previous position of allowing law enforcement 
unfettered access to health records. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would require health care providers to send patients a  
notice describing how they use electronic medical information and 
advise patients in advance of any changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Health maintenance organizations would also have to establish  
internal procedures to protect patient records, including limiting 
access to information and training employees to keep patient 
information private during their routine operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding teen-agers who seek medical care on their own, the  
plan follows the lead of existing state laws. When a state allows a 
minor to obtain health care without notifying a parent or getting 
their consent, the minor's rights would be protected under the 
proposed plan. If a state requires a parent to be involved, then 
the privacy rights would apply to the parent, not the minor. 
</P>
<P>
	During congressional debate, Democrats led by Massachusetts Sen.  
Edward Kennedy pushed to allow teens to keep their records private, 
even from their parents and even when it involves abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	After Congress failed to meet the Aug. 21 deadline it set three  
years earlier, the 1996 law required the Department of Health and 
Human Services to write regulations on medical privacy.

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin President Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Peter B. Teets stepped down Friday as president  
and chief operating officer of Lockheed Martin Corp., taking 
responsibility for disappointing financial results that led the big 
defense contractor to slash its earnings estimates for next year by 
more than half. 
</P>
<P>
	The gloomy outlook sent Lockheed shares plummeting almost 13  
percent in heavy trading on Wall Street, even though the company 
beat analysts' earnings expectations for the just-concluded third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed, based in Bethesda, Md., surprised analysts by revising  
down its estimate for earnings next year from $2.15 a share to $1, 
citing anticipated losses in its space systems division. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difficult times we have seen are not indicative of the  
company's real potential, and I feel I must step up to being 
accountable for our disappointing financial outlook for 2000,'' 
Teets said in a statement released by the company. Chairman and 
chief executive Vance Coffman, who said Teets will be missed after 
``an outstanding 37-year career,'' has assumed the duties of the 
chief operating officer until a successor is found. 
</P>
<P>
	Teets also resigned from the board of directors, which  
reportedly had been calling for a shakeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Also leaving the company is James ``Mickey'' Blackwell, head of  
aeronautical systems, which makes the F-16 jet fighter and is the 
poorest performer this year among Lockheed's four core businesses. 
Meantime, the fate of the F-22, an advanced fighter that was the 
company's hope for a new generation war plane is in doubt as 
Congress debates the need for such an expensive weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	In a conference call with analysts, Lockheed executives said  
they still intend to continue the annual dividend of 88 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	The plans to use most of the diminished earnings were received  
with skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
	``With something like 80 percent payout, this is an  
unsustainable number,'' said Joseph Campbell of Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the poor outlook reflected widespread problems in  
the company that was created in Lockheed's 1995 merger with Martin 
Marietta Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the failure of the financial management system not being  
able to asses with any accuracy at all where they're headed,'' said 
Paul Nisbet, of JSA Research Inc., who has a ``hold'' rating on the 
stock. ``I think it came from putting so many entities together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why in the midst of these difficulties, Lockheed was  
pursuing a complicated merger with Comsat Corp., which transmits 
voice and video signals by satellite, Coffman said numerous 
businesses have signed on as investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people on the planet who thinks it's a reasonable  
investment opportunity,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed stock tumbled $2.93 3/4 to close at $20 a share on the New  
York Stock Exchange, well below its 52-week high of $56.56 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's problems have been aggravated by troubles with its  
space systems business. There have been four rocket launch failures 
since August 1998 as well as satellite delays and the loss of 
satellite contracts, such as a long-held U.S. spy satellite 
contract, reportedly worth $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch failures have resulted in a decline in launches and  
orders, even as the company has invested in new, advanced rockets, 
said Robert J. Stevens, Lockheed's chief financial officer, who was 
appointed a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales in the division were expected to fall from $5.5 billion to  
$5 billion, while a profit margin of 10 percent will drop to 3 
percent to 4 percent, a level Stevens called ``unacceptable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Lockheed reported third-quarter profits of $217  
million, or 57 cents a share, down 32 percent from the $318 
million, or 83 cents a share, earned in the same period a year ago. 
Operating profits of 48 cents a share were better than the average 
47 cents expected by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson 
Financial. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell 3 percent to $6.16  
billion from $6.35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first nine months of 1999, Lockheed's earnings have  
plummeted 90 percent, dropping to $89 million, or 23 cents a share, 
from $876 million, or $2.30 a share a year earlier. Sales fell 3 
percent to $18.55 billion from $19.09 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Teets, 57, joined Martin Marietta in 1962 as an engineer and  
worked his way up the corporate ladder. He was appointed president 
and chief operating officer of Lockheed Martin in July 1997. 
Blackwell, who played a role in the development of the F-22 
fighter, joined the former Lockheed Corp. in 1969 as a research 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dain M. Hancock, president of the company's tactical aircraft  
systems, will succeed Blackwell.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson said Friday he was never invited  
to lecture at a criminology class at California State University, 
Fullerton, despite a professor's claim that he had invited Simpson 
and then changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor James Lasley said he had asked Simpson to address his  
criminology and delinquency class, but dropped the plan after the 
head of his department raised concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasley said he agreed with Phillip Gianos, acting chair of the  
department, that the visit would require extra security and 
planning for an overflow crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been asked to speak at Cal State Fullerton,''  
Simpson said in a phone interview. ``This is just not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of his ex-wife Nicole  
Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. He was found liable in a 
civil case filed after the murders. 
</P>

	Said Lasley: ``He's a walking criminology case.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Says Education Dept. Mismanaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican lawmakers contend the Education  
Department has a half-billion-dollar ``slush fund'' that could be 
used to offset proposed GOP spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``An organization that has unauditable books clearly is ripe for  
finding 1 percent savings across the board,'' Rep. Peter Hoekstra, 
R-Mich., said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He has asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, to determine whether the department mismanaged at 
least $600 million and issued duplicate checks to grant winners. 
</P>
<P>
	After giving the department less than a day's warning, Hoekstra  
and Reps. Bob Schaffer, R-Colo., and Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., spent 
Friday morning there, questioning Secretary Richard Riley and his 
deputies on an account the department maintains for grants that 
can't be awarded immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials say the Republicans' complaint is based on  
old numbers. Most of the $600 million Hoekstra questioned has since 
gone to the appropriate grant recipients, and $147 million was 
returned to the federal Treasury. Under current law, the fund, now 
about $200 million, cannot be spent on anything else, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said congressional hearings on the  
department found no corruption or mismanagement and blasted as 
``storm trooper tactics'' the three Republicans' visit on short 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon defended the queries, saying, ``If you have an account of  
$700 million and only $12 million to $13 million was put into it 
for the exact reason why this account was set up, this raises a lot 
of red flags.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Hoekstra, who chairs the House Education and the Workforce  
Committee's investigations panel: ``The agency is responsible for 
distributing $35 billion in education spending and it cannot 
determine where that money is going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers offered no examples of inappropriate ways the  
money may have been spent, citing the pending investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra said the department was one of several agencies that  
could not give the GAO sufficient paperwork to audit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a larger battle looms between the White House and Congress  
over spending bills that keep the government running, Riley and 
House Democrats accused the GOP of using gimmicks to push their 
spending plans, which carry a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut in 
federal agencies' budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's publicity stunt is an attempt to direct the focus from  
improving education,'' said Riley. He slammed the GOP-backed 
across-the-board cuts, saying it would slice $279 million from 
programs including reading, mathematics and teacher hiring. ``I 
would have hoped the House would finally get serious about 
education,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyer, a senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee,  
contended that the Republicans would rather force cuts in programs 
for poor children than negotiate ways to eliminate waste. ``In all 
the hearings we had, never did they bring one item of waste, fraud 
or abuse to be considered for cuts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra said his inquiries began five weeks ago after Education  
Department whistle-blowers pointed to internal documents that 
indicated just $13 million of the $700 million in the grant-deposit 
fund in 1996 went toward reconciling rejected or unclaimed grants 
awarded for thousands of federal kindergarten-through-12th-grade 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressmen also note $40 million in duplicate payments the  
department allegedly made to grantees -- including two $291,000 
checks to the University of Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Interpublic Combines Two Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Interpublic Group of Cos. Inc. is combining two  
of its global advertising agencies into a single agency network 
that will rank among the top five in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammirati Puris Lintas, which creates ads for clients such as  
Burger King, Dell Computer, Unilever's Bird's Eye vegetables and 
Nestle Crunch candy bars, is merging with Lowe &AMP; Partners 
Worldwide, whose clients include Coca-Cola's Sprite, General 
Motors' Opel cars and Gillette's Braun shavers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal disclosed Friday, the combined agency will handle  
advertising billings of more than $11 billion. Ad billings are what 
advertisers spend on placing its ads on TV, newspapers and other 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Geier Jr., chairman and chief executive of Interpublic,  
said the merger creates an agency large enough handle the needs 
companies that are expanding globally. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a much more powerful force in the marketplace''  
than either of the agencies were separately, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said the new agency will have access to more  
resources that can be invested in training employees and investing 
in technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency network will be called Lowe Lintas &AMP; Partners  
Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be headed by Frank Lowe as chairman and chief executive  
and Michael Sennott as deputy chairman. Lowe has been head of The 
Lowe Group which oversaw Lowe &AMP; Partners, while Sennott has been 
vice chairman of McCann-Erickson WorldGroup, part of another ad 
agency network owned by Interpublic. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Puris, the chairman, chief executive and chief creative  
officer at Ammirati, is resigning from the agency and from 
Interpublic's board. 
</P>
<P>
	He said in a statement that while he felt it would be ``a  
brilliant idea'' to combine the agencies, he did not want to stay 
on. 
</P>
<P>
	``One merger in a lifetime is enough,'' Puris said in the  
statement, referring to the 1995 combination of the agency he 
founded nearly 25 years ago, Ammirati &AMP; Puris, with Interpublic's 
Lintas Worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Puris said he was ``an entrepreneur at heart'' and hoped to  
something involving the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A creative star, he has been credited with coining the themes  
``The Ultimate Driving Machine'' for BMW and ``The Antidote to 
Civilization'' for Club Med in his early days at Ammirati &AMP; Puris. 
</P>
<P>
	Interpublic is a holding company for advertising and marketing  
services companies. In addition to the Lowe, Ammirati and 
McCann-Erickson ad agencies, it owns the media buying service 
Western Initiative Media Worldwide, the sports marketing concern 
Octagon and International Public Relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ammirati is the larger of the two agencies at the moment with  
$7.7 billion in billings and 9,800 employees. Lowe &AMP; Partners 
handles billings of $4.4 billion and employs about 3,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview, Geier said he was hopeful the combined  
agency would not have to resign any accounts because of conflicts. 
He declined to identify any rival brands that would now find 
themselves with the same ad agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there would be any job cuts, he said there are ``always  
some efficiencies when you put two agencies together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said both agencies have unfilled positions and said  
``there is not going to be that many'' jobs that will be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The new agency network would rank fourth among the U.S.-based ad  
agency networks in terms of billings, according to figures compiled 
by the trade magazine Advertising Age. 
</P>
<P>
	The three larger agency networks are McCann-Erickson Worldwide,  
which had $16.2 billion in billings last year, followed by DDB 
Needham Worldwide at $12.8 billion and Young &AMP; Rubicam at $12.6 
billion, Ad Age said.

<HEADLINE> Blackhawks 4, Red Wings 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Doug Gilmour scored his 400th career goal and  
Steve Passmore made 37 saves as the Chicago Blackhawks beat Detroit 
4-2 Friday night, ending the Red Wings' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Dean McAmmond, Bryan McCabe and Bryan Muir also scored for the  
Blackhawks, who won their second straight after an 0-4-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Duchesne and Chris Chelios had Detroit's goals as the Red  
Wings (7-2-1) lost for the first time in eight games since a 3-2 
loss to Dallas in their second game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmour's first-period goal made him the 54th player in NHL  
history to reach 400. The Blackhawks never trailed after his score, 
improving a 2-1 lead after one period to 4-2 after two. 
</P>
<P>
	Passmore gained his second career win and his first for the  
Blackhawks in place of regular Jocelyn Thibault, who beat Montreal 
1-0 Wednesday to give the Blackhawks their first win of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Passmore was at his best in the third period, when he stopped  
every one of 17 Detroit shots to protect the two-goal lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit goalie Chris Osgood made 29 saves.  
</P>
<P>
	Red Wings defenseman Larry Murphy appeared in his 1,487th game,  
tying him with Wayne Gretzky for fourth place on the NHL career 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	Duchesne was credited with the game's first goal 4:17 into the  
opening period, but it was actually Blackhawks defenseman Josef 
Marha who put it in the net. Passmore stopped Duchesne's shot, but 
the rebound stopped in the crease and was tipped in by Marha as he 
tried to clear it. 
</P>
<P>
	Osgood returned the favor to help Gilmour score his 400th at  
10:12. Osgood ventured out of the crease on an aborted clearing 
attempt and didn't return in time to stop Gilmour's behind-the-net 
shot from caroming into the net off his back. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 35 seconds later, McAmmond made a move around Chris Chelios  
at the right circle and beat Osgood cleanly to give Chicago a 2-1 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Chelios scored against his former teammates for a 2-2 tie 2:04  
into the second period. He fired into an open net as Chicago's 
Jamie Allison pushed Vyacheslav Kozlov into Passmore outside the 
crease. 
</P>
<P>
	But a power-play goal from McCabe at 3:27 and Muir's shorthanded  
score at 12:37 gave the Blackhawks a 4-2 lead. They held it to the 
end of the period, killing off a 1:21 two-man advantage for Detroit 
that featured good stops by Passmore on shots from Steve Yzerman 
and Nicklas Lidstrom.

<HEADLINE> Austria To Defend Skiing Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIGNES, France (AP) -- Having won almost everything last year,  
the Austrians have just one objective this season: the men's 
overall World Cup title. 
</P>
<P>
	Lasse Kjus of Norway won the overall World Cup crown last  
winter, the only title of any importance to escape the Austrians. 
They enjoyed one of their most successful seasons, winning 39 World 
Cup races and a staggering 13 world championship medals. 
</P>
<P>
	This season is the first since 1995 without a major  
international championship, and the Austrians are intent on 
dominating again. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Austrian team was stronger last season but watch out for  
us this year,'' said Hans Pum, head of the Austrian ski team. 
</P>
<P>
	The winners of the World Cup titles will be invited to the  
Vatican for Rome's Millennium Jubilee in April. And that's one more 
incentive for Hermann Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should have won the overall last year,'' said Maier, the  
winner of 18 World Cup races. ``I could have if it hadn't been for 
my bad back. Because of that I couldn't compete at my best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus ruled the World Cup circuit last year, winning a record  
five medals at the world championships in Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the flamboyant ``Herminator'' added two world  
championship titles to his double gold medal performance at the 
Nagano Olympics the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	``My aim this season is to beat Hermann Maier as many times as I  
can,'' said Kjus, who also won the World Cup downhill title last 
season. ``I haven't had as much training as would be ideal because 
of a knee injury this summer. But I'm not afraid of failure, that's 
one of my strong points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus and Maier are not the only two capable of capturing the  
overall crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway's Kjetil Andre Aamodt, runner-up in the overall race last  
year despite not a single victory, certainly will be among the 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also Stefan Eberharter, the most successful Austrian  
skier after Maier, and Andreas Schifferer, Josef Strobl and 
Christian Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian team's hopes lie with Kristian Ghedina, while the  
Swiss men will rely mainly on World Cup giant slalom champion 
Michael Von Gruenigen. 
</P>
<P>
	Other contenders include Finland's Kalle Palander, the slalom  
world champion, and Slovenia's Jure Kosir. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Austrian women also were in command, winning  
every World Cup title. That supremacy most likely will continue. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer, who took the overall, giant slalom and  
super-G titles last season, will have a smoother path this season, 
with two-time overall winner Katja Seizinger of Germany and 
three-time Olympic champion Deborah Compagnoni both retiring. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Martina Ertl and Hilde Gerg will carry the slack  
despite disappointing seasons last winter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to live with it and we still a lot of young skiers  
with a lot of potential coming up in the ranks,'' Germany's 
technical director Walter Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Pernilla Wiberg and Ylva Nowen, and Andrine Flemmen of  
Norway will also offer stiff competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Picabo Street, always a threat, is sidelined with severe leg  
injuries from a crash in Crans Montana, Switzerland, at the end of 
the 1997-1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Picabo has not retired but she has not yet been given the  
clearance to ski again,'' said Marjan Cernigoj, coach of the U.S. 
women's team. ``We're hoping she'll begin to free-ski some time 
this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer's main competition will come from teammates Renate  
Goetschl, the World Cup downhill champion, Michaela Dorfmeister and 
Anita Wachter. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Cup finals in mid-March in Bormio, Italy will feature  
five disciplines -- alpine, freestyle, cross-country skiing, Nordic 
combined and snowboard. 
</P>
<P>
	With no Olympics or world championships, the circuit will fill  
the gap with extra races in a schedule featuring 80 races.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Agents Seek Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- State Farm is fending off complaints by 39  
current and former agents who have asked Congress to investigate 
the insurance giant over its treatment of them and policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion of State Farm as an honest, neighborly company no  
longer exists,'' the agents said in a letter to Senate Commerce 
Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz. ``The current management of 
State Farm has, instead, repeatedly abused the policyholders and 
its independent agents for too long in order to gain unwarranted 
financial advantage for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington, Ill.-based State Farm said Friday the complaints  
were ``wild accusations'' made mostly by agents involved in a 
lawsuit against the company. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in California recently issued a summary judgment  
in favor of State Farm's right to institute various programs and 
procedures to recover from losses from Hurricane Andrew and the 
Northridge, Calif., earthquake. Agents complained the procedures 
were unfair to them and are appealing the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Other parts of that lawsuit still pending concern the company's  
right to terminate agents and whether company policies are fair to 
policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``These wild accusations are hurtful and are an outright slap in  
the face,'' said Harold Gray, State Farm's regional vice president 
for the area that includes Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said in a statement that a news conference called by  
the agents was ``a sad distraction caused by a few dozen people -- 
most of them disgruntled former agents with a litigation-inspired 
motive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pia Pialorsi, a Commerce Committee spokeswoman, said the panel's  
staff had not seen the letter, but added, ``It is something the 
committee would look into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agents said State Farm has a history of fraud and deception  
and noted that the company is involved in numerous lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge and jury, in separate rulings this month in Marion,  
Ill., awarded State Farm auto insurance customers a total of $1.2 
billion because the insurer ordered auto body shops to use generic 
replacement parts for repairs it paid for. Company officials 
maintain State Farm abides by regulations on the use of such parts 
in every state where it does business.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Appeals WTO Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The United States appealed today against a World  
Trade Organization ruling that its tax breaks for U.S. companies 
with overseas subsidiaries violate international rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The WTO judgment, issued Oct. 8, is potentially politically  
explosive as it would force fundamental changes in the U.S. 
Internal Revenue Code. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade Representative Charlene Barshevsky said in a statement  
that the WTO panel ``committed multiple legal errors on both 
substantive and procedural issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel upheld a complaint from the European Union against the  
so-called U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation Program, which grants tax 
relief to U.S. corporations exporting through offshore 
subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU claims that the program gives U.S. multinationals unfair  
tax breaks worth $2.5 billion per year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barshevsky disagreed that the system was unfair.  
</P>
<P>
	``A careful review of the history of this issue, the facts of  
record, and the applicable WTO legal rules concerning income tax 
measures should result in a reversal of the panel's decision,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue will now be considered by the WTO's appellate body,  
which will issue its findings early next year.

<HEADLINE> Texas Judge Warns CBS Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JASPER, Texas (AP) -- An appeals court granted a temporary delay  
Friday to a CBS News producer faced with having to turn over a 
transcript of a complete interview with a dragging death defendant 
or go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Mapes was subpoenaed last week and ordered to hand over a  
transcript and outtakes from Dan Rather's interview with Shawn 
Allen Berry that aired Sept. 28 on ``60 Minutes II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a hearing Friday morning, Judge Joe Bob Golden told the  
Dallas-based producer to turn over the transcript by 3 p.m. or 
report to Jasper County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an appeals court issued a stay just minutes after the  
deadline, preventing enforcement of the judge's order and setting 
another hearing for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mapes' attorneys have argued handing over material that has  
not been broadcast violates First Amendment protections for the 
media and could compromise journalists' ability to report the news. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say they want to compare Berry's statements in the  
interview to others he gave during the investigation into the June 
7, 1998, dragging death of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mapes ``is clearly a witness to statements made by Shawn  
Berry out of court, and they are admissible against him,'' said 
Brit Featherston, an assistant U.S. attorney working with county 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the CBS interview, Berry said he tried to stop the attack on  
Byrd, but backed off when John William King threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
	King and Lawrence Russell Brewer, white supremacists who became  
friends in prison, were convicted and sentenced to death earlier 
this year in separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mapes testified the transcripts were at her house, about 200  
miles northwest of Jasper. She said she never had the raw 
videotapes in her possession and last saw them when Rather left for 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's hearing was one of two battles between CBS News and  
prosecutors over the interview. Earlier in the week, prosecutors 
initiated proceedings to require Rather to testify about the 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS News president Andrew Heyward said the company would fight  
the request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pursuing the legal means at our disposal to protect our  
constitutional rights and not turn over what we consider private, 
confidential journalistic materials,'' he said on the CBS Evening 
News. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the process to obtain a subpoena for a witness who lives  
outside of Texas, prosecutors were required to make their request 
to Golden, who certified that Rather is a ``material and necessary 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The request was sent to New York authorities, and a judge there  
will decide whether to compel Rather to testify in Texas after 
conducting a hearing on the matter. Such a hearing likely would 
occur before the expected start of the evidence phase in Berry's 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	After Ms. Mapes' hearing, attorneys began the fifth day of jury  
selection. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Berry faces a life sentence or death by injection.

<HEADLINE> Report: Toyota To Produce in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. plans to set up a joint venture  
with a state-run company in China to begin passenger car production 
there, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a production proposal by Toyota and China's state-run  
Tianjin Automotive Industrial (Group) Co., Japan's top automaker 
will first transfer its technology for subcompact cars to the 
Chinese company, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Joint production would begin later, the financial daily said,  
adding that the Chinese government could approve the plan as early 
as this year and Tianjin Automotive could begin using Toyota's 
technology next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tianjin Automotive will likely produce subcompacts based on the  
platform used for Toyota's 1-liter Vitz. The Chinese company is 
expected to roll out 100,000-150,000 vehicles annually, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If subcompact production at Tianjin Automotive goes smoothly,  
the two firms will set up a 50-50 venture, building production 
lines in plants provided by the Chinese firm. The joint venture 
contract will run for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The venture will produce new models based on Toyota's  
Corolla-class passenger cars. It is expected to produce 
20,000-30,000 vehicles annually at first and then hike output to 
more than 100,000 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, Volkswagen AG has already begun joint production of  
passenger cars in Changchun, Jilin Province, and Shanghai. Honda 
Motor Co. has been producing Accords in a joint venture in 
Guangdong Province since the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Big Waves Kill Bride in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Giant waves swept a woman to her  
death as her husband took her picture at Lover's Point on the final 
day of their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Eamon and Jennifer Stookesberry were standing on rocks by the  
shore when 10-foot waves crashed over them Thursday. He dove in 
after his wife and the stormy seas tossed them about 50 yards from 
shore, a Coast Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers pulled Stookesberry, 28, into their boat first, then  
got to Mrs. Stookesberry, 23. She was pronounced dead at a 
hospital. Her husband was treated for hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	A bouquet of yellow spider mums lay across the computer keyboard  
Friday at Mrs. Stookesberry's desk in an Alamo doctors' office 
where she worked as a receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the pediatricians in the office, who also is a minister,  
officiated at the couple's wedding on Saturday. Mrs. Stookesberry 
was due back at work Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we were all anxious to hear about their honeymoon,'' her  
supervisor, Judi Hicklin, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple wanted to honeymoon in Jamaica, but decided to save  
their money and go there on their first anniversary, Hicklin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The young woman, who would often leave her desk to comfort sick  
children and their parents in the waiting room, wanted to be a 
doctor, Hicklin said. She planned to start college in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, rescuers up and down the California coast were busy  
Thursday as a sea storm worked its way south from Pacific Grove, 
about 85 miles south of San Francisco, hitting the Santa Cruz and 
Monterey areas right around high tide. The storm spawned giant 
waves that crashed under sunny skies amid balmy temperatures, 
luring big-wave surfers to the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Several got in trouble. The Coast Guard in Monterey knew of four  
surfers in distress at the same time. ``Between the radios and the 
phones, it was nonstop,'' Petty Officer Robert Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Jordan, 20, of San Jose, died after surfing near Capitola.

<HEADLINE> Marilyn Auction Tops $13M in Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bidders hoping to get a piece of Marilyn Monroe  
memorabilia once again drove up prices on everything from books and 
scripts to furniture and clothing. A two-day auction of her 
belongings ended with final sales of more than $13.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The highest of the more than 500 lots auctioned Thursday was a  
traveling make-up case with a pre-sale estimate of between $1,000 
and $1,500. The case, which included an assortment of cosmetics, 
sold for $266,500 to Ripley's Believe It Or Not! 
</P>
<P>
	Other high bids Thursday included $145,500 for a temporary  
driver's license issued to Monroe in California in 1956, also 
purchased by Ripley's, and $90,500 for the printed certificate of 
Monroe's conversion to Judaism signed by Monroe and husband Arthur 
Miller. The buyer was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Bids again soared above pre-auction estimates. All prices  
included a 15 percent commission to Christie's auction house, which 
held the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, 54 high-profile items brought in more than $5.6  
million, including $1.26 million for the formfitting dress Monroe 
wore to serenade President Kennedy with ``Happy Birthday'' at a 
Madison Square Garden party in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Other big-ticket items that went Wednesday included a platinum,  
diamond-encrusted ring given to Monroe by Joe DiMaggio ($772,500) 
and a baby grand piano once owned by Monroe's mother ($632,500). 
</P>
<P>
	The piano was purchased by singer Mariah Carey, whose decorator  
placed the winning bid by telephone, The New York Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Monroe left all her belongings to her acting coach, method  
acting guru Lee Strasberg. His widow, Anna Strasberg, was selling 
the items.

<HEADLINE> Clintons To Close on Home Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clintons are set to close on a $1.7  
million Westchester County home Monday, allowing the first lady to 
establish residency in New York state in anticipation of her likely 
run for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-bedroom colonial with two fireplaces, a swimming pool  
and an exercise room, is in the upscale New York City suburb of 
Chappaqua. The Clintons will not attend the closing but will be 
represented by attorneys and brokers, said Jim Kennedy of the White 
House counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear when the Clintons will move into the house. To run  
for the Senate from New York, Mrs. Clinton must establish residency 
there by Election Day next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton's $1.36 million home loan is from PNC Mortgage Corp.  
of America. The conventional 30-year, adjustable-rate mortgage has 
a 7.5 percent interest rate locked in for the first three years, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under pressure from critics, the Clintons scrapped their initial  
plan to have Terry McAuliffe, a friend and Democratic fund-raiser, 
put up $1.35 million as collateral to guarantee the Clinton's 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge on Friday dismissed an attempt by Judicial  
Watch, a conservative group, to block the Clinton's new mortgage. 
Group leader Larry Klayman -- alleging the deal is better than 
others would get -- said he would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton will travel to New York City next week. She and  
Donna Hanover -- the wife of Mrs. Clinton's likely Senate rival, New 
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani -- were to appear Wednesday at a 
breast cancer research fund-raising event. But Hanover pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Joannie Danielides said Hanover's schedule changed  
because of a commitment to ``House Beautiful,'' a program she hosts 
for cable station A&AMP;E. She denied Friday that Hanover backed out 
because Mrs. Clinton would be there.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Airlines Profit Up 23 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore Airlines' profit rose 23 percent in  
the first half, reflecting Asia's emergence from two years of 
economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Its profit rose to 577 million Singapore dollars, or $340  
million, from 468 million Singapore dollars a year earlier, the 
flagship carrier said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Group revenue grew 14 percent to 4.3 billion Singapore dollars,  
or $2.5 billion, from 3.8 billion Singapore dollars a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Asia's recovery, the outlook for travel remains fragile  
and will hinge on continued improvement in the region, Japan's 
recovery efforts, and the strength of the U.S. economy, the airline 
said.

<HEADLINE> AMA Unveils Health Info Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking to give patients more reliable online  
health news and advice, the nation's leading physician groups are 
starting their own Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and six other physician groups  
early next year will launch medem.com, an effort to combat fears 
that patients are getting inaccurate and misleading information 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 writers and editors will provide daily health and  
medical research news. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is free for consumers, though doctors have to pay $70  
per month. Doctors can have their fee covered by a sponsoring 
company. No sponsors have been signed up yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers have flocked online as an easy way to obtain detailed  
information about diseases affecting them and their family. Doctors 
have complained about patient queries sparked by questionable 
material found on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Medem.com will offer the same news and information available  
online from sites such as drkoop.com and America Online's Health 
Channel, but the physician groups say their credibility gives them 
an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medem, based in San Francisco, also hopes to attract consumers  
by providing a direct link to Web sites of physicians who sign up 
for the service. Through the link, medem.com will provide patients 
a secure service so patients and physicians can communicate via 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medem.com will give our patients access to information they  
can trust and information they can use with their physicians in 
order to improve their health care,'' said Dr. H. Dunbar Hoskins 
Jr., chairman of the Medem board of directors and executive vice 
president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. ``We felt much 
of the information being delivered on the Internet was inaccurate 
and out of context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the for-profit initiative will have trouble  
attracting consumers because of the unfamiliar name of medem.com, 
its relatively late arrival on the Internet scene and the AMA's 
close connection to doctors rather than patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are facing an enormous amount of competition online  
that's already gone down the learning curve to acquire and retain 
customers,'' said Claudine Singer, an Internet analyst with Jupiter 
Communications in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major health-related Web sites include Intellihealth.com,  
WebMD.com and healtheon.com, all of which have been available for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the AMA and the ophthalmology academy, the other  
groups participating are: the American Academy of Pediatrics; the 
American College of Allergy, Asthma &AMP; Immunology; the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the American 
Psychiatric Association; and the American Society of Plastic 
Surgeons.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Prisoner Charged in Sex Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEERFIELD, N.H. (AP) -- Three months after he was released from a  
Texas prison and taken in by a family in this small New Hampshire 
town, a convicted child molester was on the run Friday, charged 
with sexually assaulting the family's 5-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Sgt. Steve Turner said he wasn't sure how the family met  
Jon Savarino Schillaci, but he believed it was through a magazine 
or a service that arranges pen pals for prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	``They corresponded back and forth for 10 years, and he  
indicated when he was ready to actually be released that he wanted 
to move out of Texas and change his life,'' Turner said. 
``Obviously they made a very poor error in judgment in believing 
that a pedophile could change his stripes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the 5-year-old boy told his parents that he and Jon  
``have a secret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schillaci was charged Tuesday with aggravated felonious sexual  
assault. He disappeared before police could arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he's on a bus somewhere, he hasn't got much money and he  
isn't going to go that far,'' Turner said Friday. ``We're treating 
him as a dangerous sexual predator.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turner said the couple apparently was aware of Schillaci's  
criminal record. He said authorities are not pursuing any charges, 
such as child endangerment, against the parents at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple, who also have a 1 1/2-year-old son, could not be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Schillaci, then 17, pleaded guilty to two counts of sex  
performed by a child and four counts of aggravated sexual assault, 
according to Larry Fitzgerald, spokesman for the Texas Department 
of Criminal Justice. He has family in Texas but never received any 
visitors while serving his 10-year sentence in a Houston prison, 
Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schillaci was released July 30, and on Sept. 1, registered as a  
sex offender with police in Deerfield, a town of about 3,500.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Tries To Stop Computer Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department sued on Friday to block  
Michigan-based Compuware Corp.'s $168 million acquisition of 
Viasoft Inc. on grounds the deal could result in higher prices and 
diminished service for two types of critical mainframe computer 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here, the government  
alleged the deal would significantly reduce competition in the 
United States for mainframe testing and debugging software and for 
mainframe fault management software, which the government said is 
crucial for some mainframe computer users to maintain efficient 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Compuware agreed to pay $9 a share to acquire the  
Phoenix-based provider of information technology management. 
Compuware, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., provides management 
and development software. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, Compuware said Viasoft and CV Acquisition  
Inc. -- a Compuware merger subsidiary -- have extended the offer to 
Nov. 5. It had been scheduled to expire Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Compuware said it is ``reviewing our options with counsel'' in  
light of the government's lawsuit. But the companies remain 
committed to completing their merger, Compuware said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's announcement Friday ``completely  
mischaracterizes the marketplace for our software products,'' Peter 
Karmanos Jr., Compuware's chairman and chief executive, said in the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DOJ has made it clear they don't understand what our  
products do or the dynamics of the mission-critical software 
marketplace. Unfortunately, they've compounded their error by 
choosing to file this lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Compuware is the world's dominant producer  
of mainframe testing and debugging software, with 60 percent of the 
market, and Viasoft is its closest rival and the only alternative 
to Compuserve for some consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Compuserve also dominates world sales of mainframe fault  
management software, with more 80 percent of the market, the 
government said. Viasoft is a recent entrant in this market with 
what the government called a promising, potentially significant 
competitive product. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint said that this is the latest in a series of  
Compuware acquisitions to acquire competitors' testing and 
debugging and fault management software, and the government said 
Compuware ceased sales and upgrades for those products after 
acquiring them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless this acquisition is blocked, buyers of this

<HEADLINE> Computer Woes Hurt Hershey Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Many little ghosts and goblins won't find  
Hershey chocolates in their trick-or-treat bags this weekend 
because trouble with the candymaker's new $112 million computer 
system is fouling up deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	It couldn't happen at a worse time for Hershey Foods Corp., the  
nation's biggest candymaker: More candy is eaten at Halloween than 
on any other holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The foul-ups are a sweet opportunity for some of Hershey's  
competitors, such as No. 2 Mars Inc., which makes M&AMP;M's, Snickers 
and Mars bars, and Nestle, which makes Baby Ruth, Butterfinger and 
Nestle Crunch. 
</P>
<P>
	Beth MacIndoe of Chesterfield, N.J., went to three stores  
looking for miniature Hershey bars before giving up and buying 
lollipops for trick-or-treaters. ``I was disappointed because I 
like the variety,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And if Hershey can't fix the problems soon, this year's  
Christmas stockings could be stuffed with a lot fewer Hershey's 
Kisses and more Snickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey -- which also makes Hershey chocolate bars, Reese's  
Peanut Butter Cups, Twizzlers and Milk Duds -- had planned to bring 
the computer system online during a slow period in April, but was 
forced to delay that until July, and is still having trouble 
getting candy into stores in the right amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey announced a 16 percent drop in third-quarter earnings  
per share earlier this week, and chairman and chief executive 
Kenneth L. Wolfe acknowledged the distribution woes have led to 
lost sales and increased costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey has been able to supply enough candy to some customers,  
but not others, causing shortages in various places around the 
country. In some cases, stores are stocking their shelves with 
other brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey officials would not discuss the troubles Friday, but a  
recording on a consumer hot line acknowledged that computer 
problems had led to ``some difficulty in distribution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Please be assured that we are doing everything possible to  
correct these temporary difficulties,'' the recording said. ``We 
apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate your patience. You 
should be able to locate your favorite products in your stores 
soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a supermarket just outside this community founded on  
chocolate, Evy Else recounted how she tried several area stores for 
her favorite kind of Hershey bar -- the original, regular size -- and 
came up empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I settled for the little bars, but I don't like them,'' she  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the computer trouble, orders have been taking two to  
five days longer than the usual 10 to 12 days to process orders, 
said Leonard Teitelbaum, an analyst with Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey may end up missing as much as $100 million in sales in  
the fourth quarter as a result, he said.

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Animal Researcher Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Federal investigators hope razor-lined  
envelopes mailed to 88 animal researchers in 13 states hold DNA 
evidence that will help them track down the senders. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI offices nationwide were retrieving the letters from  
recipients and mailing them to the Las Vegas office, agent Kevin 
Caudle said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans for Medical Progress, a group that monitors the work  
of universities that have research facilities, said the letters 
were mailed earlier this month and postmarked from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities will forward the envelopes to laboratories in  
Washington to test for DNA, saliva or fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blades are taped to the inside flap of the envelope so if  
you open them and put your hand in, it would cut you,'' Caudle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	An enclosed letter gives scientists one year to abandon their  
research or ``your violence will be turned back upon you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 88 recipients had been identified in a communique from a  
group calling itself the ``Justice Department,'' said Jacquie 
Calnan, president of the watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	States where researchers were targeted include Alabama,  
California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Set Clocks Back Sunday at 2 a.m. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Say goodbye to daylight-saving time this  
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Clocks shift back one hour at 2 a.m. Sunday, local time, giving  
an extra hour of sleep to most people Saturday night -- an extra 
hour of work to those who work the overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	And the change means it will be dark an hour earlier Sunday  
night, Halloween, calling for extra caution on the part of drivers 
and those watching the children on their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Most people set their clocks back before retiring Saturday  
evening. Those who don't need to remember to set them back Sunday -- 
or they'll be an hour out of sync with the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	If they still haven't remembered to do it by Monday morning,  
they could be an hour early for work. 
</P>
<P>
	Daylight-saving time returns April 2.  
</P>
<P>
	The Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends that batteries  
be changed in smoke detectors when clocks are reset. The commission 
said about 16 million homes have detectors that don't work, usually 
because of a dead or missing battery.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST ALLIS, Wis. (AP) -- Jennifer Rodriguez won the 500-meter  
race and brothers Cory and Kip Carpenter each captured events 
Friday in a World Cup qualifier for the U.S. speedskating team. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing through Sunday at the Pettit National Ice Center will  
determine the team makeup for World Cup races this fall. Some 
skaters have already qualified based on last year's results but 
three spots were open on the sprint team, which races only at 500 
and 1,000 meters, and the all-around team, which competes at longer 
distances. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez, of Miami, who has already qualified for the  
all-around squad and the 1,000-meter sprint race, is trying to add 
the 500-meter event to her repertoire. Rodriguez skated the 500 in 
40.62 seconds to edge Elizabeth Ochowicz of Waukesha, Wis., 
(40.86). A second 500 meter race Saturday will determine the 
qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
	Ochowicz came back to win the 1,000 meter race in 1:24.19, .05  
faster than Whitney McGill of Champaign, Ill. McGill was third in 
the 500 in 41.76 and Becky Lang of Waupaca, Wis., was third in the 
1,000 in 1:25.91. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 500, Kip Carpenter won in 37.19 to edge his  
brother, Cory, who finished in 37.30. KC Boutiette of Tacoma, 
Wash., the top U.S. skater in all-around events, finished third in 
37.60. 
</P>
<P>
	Cory Carpenter won the 1,000 in 1:13.50, Boutiette was second in  
1:14.02 and Derek Parra of San Bernardino, Calif., was third in 
1:14.03.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Schools Get New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The embattled leader of the nation's  
second-largest school district vowed to sue the Board of Education 
after its members voted to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 4-3 vote Thursday night, the board authorized its attorneys  
to begin negotiating a severance package for Superintendent Ruben 
Zacarias. 
</P>
<P>
	Zacarias, who did not take part in the closed-door discussions,  
said he did not know how long negotiations would take. He has 20 
months remaining on the $178,000-a-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the meantime, it's business as usual; 700,000 kids need our  
help,'' he said. ``I'm still the superintendent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also promised to take the school board to court, although he  
said he had no timetable on that either. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote, which had been expected, followed the board's decision  
to reaffirm its support for Howard Miller, an attorney and former 
board member appointed earlier this month as the district's chief 
executive officer. He is in charge of day-to-day operations of the 
690,000-student Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
	Zacarias has been under increasing fire from the board.  
</P>
<P>
	His troubles came after it was learned the nation's most  
expensive high school, the Belmont Learning Complex, was being 
constructed on a toxic site, and that paperwork problems could cost 
the district $900 million in state bond money needed to build 100 
new schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``The district will be made healthier, and I think what will  
happen is people will see that this was an extraordinarily good 
move to make in the interests of children,'' Board President 
Genethia Hudley Hayes said after the vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort to oust the district's top administrator had been  
protested by some as anti-Latino, but Zacarias, 70, rejected that 
view during a news conference before the board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about race or ethnicity,'' he said. ``I would do  
everything possible to shut down anyone that makes an ethnic or 
religious or cultural or racial issue out of what's happened.''

<HEADLINE> Elf Aquitaine Appoints New Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French oil company Elf Aquitaine on Friday  
appointed Pierre Vaillaud as its chairman to replace Philippe 
Jaffre, who resigned in the wake of Elf's announcement of a merger 
with rival Total Fina. 
</P>
<P>
	The changeover came as Elf directors met to take note of last  
month's deal with Total to create the world's fourth-largest oil 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf and Total Fina entered a friendly merger pact Sept. 13 after  
a nine-week takeover battle. The two companies said they would 
remain on an equal footing after the merger, but analysts said 
Total is gaining effective control. 
</P>
<P>
	Total Fina chairman Thierry Desmarest will head the new company.  
The resignation of Jaffre, who had launched a counterbid to Total's 
original July offer, was part of the merger deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaillaud, the new chairman, last served as director general of  
French engineering group Technip SA and has served in several posts 
at Total, Elf said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal has yet to be approved by the European Commission,  
which has raised concerns over possible competition implications.

<HEADLINE> New-Home Sales Fall in September Rising Mortgage Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JEANNINE AVERSA 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New-home sales posted the biggest plunge in  
more than five years last month, dropping 12.8 percent as 
prospective buyers were put off by rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of new single-family homes fell last month to a seasonally  
adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units, much weaker than many 
analysts expected. It was the largest drop since January 1994, when 
sales plummeted by 24 percent, the Commerce Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	And the 811,000 units sold was the lowest level since December  
1997, when 791,000 units were sold at an annual rate, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pointing to lower sales throughout the country, economists  
blamed rising mortgage rates as the biggest reason for the decline. 
Hurricane Floyd, which raked the East Coast last month, was 
another, lesser factor, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interest rate story,'' said David Seiders, chief  
economist for the National Association of Home Builders. ``Housing 
is still the most interest-sensitive part of the economy, and the 
average mortgage rate in September was up by basically a percentage 
point from the lows early in the year. House buying demand is 
tampering off because of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The monthly average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in  
September was 7.82 percent, up from 6.72 percent a year earlier, 
but lower than August's 7.94 percent average rate, the mortgage 
company Freddie Mac said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The housing sector is cooling off as higher mortgage rates  
take their toll,'' said Merrill Lynch economist Karen Dexter. 
</P>
<P>
	Eroding consumer confidence, which fell in October for the  
fourth month in a row, and a volatile stock market also may have 
influenced consumers' decisions not to buy homes last month, 
economists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans' borrowing costs rose when the Federal Reserve bumped  
up short-term interest rates in June and August to slow the economy 
and keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers meet Nov. 16, and many economists still  
believe they will nudge up rates for a third time this year despite 
Friday's latest indication of a slowing housing market. 
</P>
<P>
	The weak report ``does not mean the Fed will not tighten another  
notch,'' said First Union economist Mark Vitner. 
</P>
<P>
	September's performance followed a revised August sales pace of  
930,000 units, much lower than the previously estimated 983,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though new-home sales were down, the average sales price  
hit an all-time high of $196,900 in September, up from $192,400 the 
month before. 
</P>
<P>
	And the $160,000 median price for a new home -- meaning half the  
homes sold in September sold for less and half for more -- tied a 
record set in April and was up from August's median price of 
$153,900. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, new-home sales in the West were the weakest, falling  
by 14.8 percent to an annual rate of 213,000 units in September. In 
the Midwest, new-home sales declined by 14.2 percent to an annual 
rate of 175,000 units, and in the South they dropped by 11.3 
percent to an annual rate of 345,000 units. Sales in the Northeast 
fell by 8.1 percent to an annual rate of 79,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher mortgage rates also took a bite out of existing home  
sales in September. The National Association of Realtors reported 
Monday that existing home sales fell 2.1 percent in September, the 
third straight monthly decline. Nonetheless, such sales are still 
heading toward a banner year. 
</P>
<P>
	The decrease in new-home sales meant that it would take 4.9  
months to exhaust the existing supply of unsold homes at the 
September sales pace. Home builders took notice of the uptick in 
this figure -- the highest inventory number in three years.

<HEADLINE> Akamai Shares Soar in IPO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Akamai Technologies Inc. shares more than  
quintupled Friday in the fourth-hottest initial public offering 
ever, underscoring investor enthusiasm for a new Internet 
technology that speeds up delivery of Web pages to computer users. 
</P>
<P>
	The red-hot investor reception bestowed yet another staggering  
valuation on a small, money-losing Internet company. 
</P>
<P>
	Akamai closed at $145.18 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after it  
was initially priced at $26 a share and opened at $110. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock's 458 percent increase from its initial price is the  
fourth-highest of all time, according to financial market 
researcher Securities Data Corp. No. 1 theglobe.com rose 606 
percent on opening day, Foundry Networks rose 525 percent and 
MarketWatch.com rose 474 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Akamai sold 9 million shares to raise more than $1.3 billion.  
Its closing share price gave Akamai a stunning market value of more 
than $13 billion -- even though Akamai had sales of just $1.3 
million and lost $28.3 million in the first nine months of this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Akamai (pronounced AH-kuh-my) is Hawaiian for intelligent,  
clever and cool. 
</P>
<P>
	Formed last year, the Cambridge, Mass.-based company offers  
Yahoo! and other Web destinations a service that delivers the most 
image-intensive portions of their Web pages -- such as 
advertisements with colorful moving images -- through a speedier 
route than the public Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The service answers a common complaint that graphic-intensive  
Web pages take too long to download and can cause computers to 
crash. This is particularly important to Web site advertisers that 
use fancy images to promote their products. 
</P>
<P>
	To provide the service, Akamai owns a global network of 1,475  
computer servers and rents space on them to Web companies such as 
Yahoo! These Web destinations use the servers to store graphic-rich 
information closer to Internet users' computers, circumventing part 
of the crowded public information highway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Akamai technology is based on the initial work of F. Thomas  
Leighton, a math professor at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, and one of his students, Danny Lewin. 
</P>
<P>
	Leighton is Amakai's chief scientist. The company's chief  
executive, George H. Conrades, was a senior vice president of 
International Business Machines Corp. and president of Internet 
pioneer BBN Corp., which he sold to GTE Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Demand for the Akamai service is ``immense,'' said Ullas Naik,  
an analyst with FAC EquitiesFirst Albany, a Boston-based investment 
firm. ``It's going to keep growing significantly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with investments in Akamai include Apple Computer  
Inc., network equipment supplier Cisco Systems Inc. and Microsoft 
Corp.

<HEADLINE> Shortage of One Type of Penicillin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A shortage of one type of intravenous  
penicillin, which began last spring, has worsened, sparking the 
government to urge doctors to use remaining supplies carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Food and Drug Administration said there is no need for  
panic: Intravenous penicillin G is the preferred therapy for only a 
handful of rare infections. Even for those, other types of 
penicillin or newer antibiotics are successful treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	The shortage began in June, when Marsam Pharmaceuticals recalled  
its IV penicillin G supplies and quit manufacturing. An FDA 
inspection had cited serious manufacturing deficiencies that it 
said raised questions about the drug's safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Pfizer Inc., the other major manufacturer of IV penicillin G,  
has back orders with pharmacies awaiting new supplies as soon as it 
can make them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday  
published an update telling doctors the shortage had worsened and 
advising them to use remaining stocks only for those infections 
where IV penicillin G is the preferred therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cases: babies born with syphilis; people whose syphilis  
has spread to the nervous system, which happens in about 5 percent 
of untreated syphilis cases; and preventing pregnant women from 
spreading group B strep to the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC told doctors there are alternative antibiotics for these  
conditions, including other forms of penicillin G not in short 
supply, and newer antibiotics. Doctors can find the treatment 
advice at http://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/dstd/pencillinG.htm on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA, meanwhile, is trying to increase IV penicillin G  
supplies by working with Pfizer and other, smaller suppliers to 
increase production. It also is looking to Europe and other 
countries where the drug is sold, considering imported supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	While the drug is preferred treatment for only a few infections,  
newer antibiotics have a broader range of action, meaning they can 
fight more kinds of germs at once. Because antibiotic resistance 
grows whenever germs are exposed to the drugs, doctors prefer to 
use the narrowest-acting type, so getting new supplies of IV 
penicillin G is important.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces Toxic Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies that use even the smallest amounts  
of highly toxic chemicals will be required to report the use to the 
public, President Clinton said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Current federal regulations require only companies that use  
large amounts of extremely toxic chemicals, like mercury and 
dioxin, to disclose their use. The new rules, Clinton said in his 
weekly radio address, would force companies that use much smaller 
amounts to follow the same disclosure guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll require companies to inform the public even if they're  
using smaller quantities,'' the president said, ``in some cases 
just 10 pounds a year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that lowering the amount for disclosure will help  
communities force polluting companies to act more responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
	``By requiring industries to tell communities how much they  
pollute the air and water, we empower citizens to fight back, and 
create a powerful incentive for industry to pollute less,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private watchdog  
group, praised the new rules action but said they contained ``some 
serious flaws.' It cited the absence of lead, a substance known to 
hinder children's development, from the list of substances. 
</P>
<P>
	On another environmental topic, Clinton criticized the  
Republican-sponsored Interior Department spending bill, which he 
said ``is laden with provisions that would benefit special 
interests at the expense of our public interest and our 
environment.'' He promised to veto the bill if it is sent to him. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I am taking action to protect communities against toxic  
chemicals, Congress is giving special interests license to pollute 
our public lands,'' Clinton said. ``While I'm taking action to save 
some of our most treasured places, Congress is putting other 
precious lands at greater risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president also announced that the non-profit Wildlands  
Conservancy is donating to the federal government an additional 
14,000 acres of the Joshua Tree National Park in California. 
</P>
<P>
	And he said he plans to begin negotiating with Congress to  
purchase the Baca Ranch in New Mexico, which has one of the world's

	Republican Debate Staged in N.H.  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Next time, Gov. George W. Bush's rivals for  
the Republican presidential nomination will be debating against him 
instead of about him. ``I'm sure Gov. Bush will be very active in 
this campaign, particularly since we're moving up so rapidly in the 
polls,'' said Sen. John McCain, who trails Bush but is gaining. 
McCain said he'd have preferred to have Bush participate in the 
forum at Dartmouth College on Thursday night because New Hampshire 
voters deserved it. The Arizona senator, publisher Steve Forbes, 
conservative activist Gary Boer, commentator Alan Keys and Sen. 
Orrin Hatch of Utah went ahead without Bush, meeting for the second 
time in a week in a 60-minute question-and-answer format.

	U.S. Envoy Expects Deal With China  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- The United States and China may soon reach  
agreement on compensation for damages from NATO's bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia -- a step that would help put the 
divisive issue behind the governments, a senior U.S. diplomat said 
today. U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering described his 
talks Thursday with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi as an 
overview of the two countries' relations, which have been stormy 
since the May 7 bombing. He said the diplomats discussed other 
points of friction: Beijing's crackdown on dissent and the Falun 
Gong spiritual movement, Taiwan and trade.

	Falun Gong Maintains Defiant Stance  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- After staging a news conference Thursday that was  
organized in secret, members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual 
movement continued their defiance Friday morning. Followers, 
unbowed by tighter security, staged two protests around Beijing's 
Tiananmen square early Friday. Plainclothes and uniformed police 
immediately tackled the protesters, with at least one being dragged 
by his hair. Nearly 30 members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual 
movement spoke out Thursday, denouncing torture at the hands of 
Chinese police and promising continued defiance. One member 
displayed wrists bruised by manacles; another told how police 
burned her face with an electric baton; an 11-year-old said he was 
expelled from school for his beliefs.

	Senate Nears Tax Break Agreement  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Democrats drop their objections, Senate  
Republicans are preparing to push through an $8.5 billion extension 
of expiring tax breaks. Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told 
reporters that Republicans agreed to support moving the so-called 
extenders bill through the Senate unanimously without any 
amendments. ``It's got broad support,'' Lott said Thursday after a 
closed-door meeting of GOP senators. ``We want to do the 
extenders.'' The Finance Committee legislation would extend several 
business tax credits through Dec. 31, 2000, including the research 
and development credit that expired June 30. It would also ensure 
that millions of average taxpayers who claim numerous personal tax 
credits do not get tangled up in the alternative minimum tax in 
1999 and 2000.

	Clinton Aides Meet With Helms Staff  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is trying to work out a deal  
with Sen. Jesse Helms on former Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun's 
nomination to be ambassador to New Zealand. White House staff 
members met with Helms' staff on Thursday to try to come up with a 
list of documents sought by the North Carolina Republican, chairman 
of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If his committee 
receives the ``relevant documents,'' a hearing can be held as early 
as next Tuesday, with a vote the following day, Helms said in a 
statement. Moseley-Braun, the nation's first black female senator, 
was defeated in a 1998 re-election bid. Civil rights groups and 
congressional Democrats have criticized Helms for seeking to block 
the nomination.

to transfer tens of millions of dollars to bank accounts linked to 
accused terrorist Osama bin Laden, USA Today in its editions Friday

audit obtained by U.S. intelligence shows that five top Saudi

Coyotes beat the Vancouver Canucks 4-1 Thursday night. Goalie

scored with one second remaining in regulation as the Coyotes 
bounced back from an 0-1-1 skid.

	Jabs Taken At Bush in GOP Debate  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Most of the Republican presidential  
hopefuls participating in a debate last night stuck to the issues, 
but a few jabs were directed toward the absent front-runner, George 
W. Bush. ``Perhaps in the future at a forum like this if we call it 
a fund-raiser he might show up,'' candidate Steve Forbes said of 
the Texas governor, whom he accused of skipping campaign events to 
raise funds for his candidacy. Forbes was on the receiving end on 
another issue, when conservative activist Bauer said his flat tax 
proposal would let some corporations escape taxes ``while you (the 
taxpayers) are paying 25 percent between the income tax and the 
payroll tax.''

	Regulations on Medical Privacy Proposed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Picking up where Congress failed, President  
Clinton is proposing regulations to keep electronic medical records 
from the prying eyes of employers, marketing firms and others who 
often see patients' most sensitive information without their 
consent. ``I will use the full authority of this office to create 
the first comprehensive national standards for the protection of 
medical records,'' Clinton said in a prepared statement. The 
proposed regulations, administration officials said, would restrict 
the use and release of private health information transmitted or 
maintained by computers. Congress debated the issue for years, but 
failed to meet a self-imposed Aug. 21 deadline for legislating new 
protections.

terrorist, U.S. intelligence officials told USA Today. The money 
was deposited into accounts of Islamic charities, including Islamic 
Relief and Blessed Relief, that serve as fronts for bin Laden, the

	Giant Cyclone Hits India

	BHUBANESWAR, India (AP) -- A powerful cyclone, the second in two  
weeks, slammed into India's eastern coast today as authorities 
packed villagers into trucks in an effort to evacuate 20,000 
people. The cyclone bearing winds up to 155 mph hit along 300 miles 
of coastline in the states of Orissa and West Bengal at midday 
today. Even when the full-blown storm was still several miles 
offshore, powerful winds flattened simple mud huts, uprooted trees 
and cut off communications to the worst-hit areas. ``Its a rare 
supercyclone,'' said L.K. Chand of the meteorological office in 
Bhubaneswar.

	HOUSTON (AP) -- The skirl of a lone bagpipe playing the Scottish  
lament ``Going Home'' cut through ghostly fog in a chilling tribute 
to Payne Stewart before the start of the Tour Championship 
yesterday. With sullen faces and vacant eyes, Stewart's peers on 
the PGA Tour sat on white folding chairs on the first tee of 
Champions Golf Club to honor his memory at the tournament where he 
was to have played. ``He loved to laugh and he was not ashamed to 
cry. I'm not going to be ashamed of my tears this morning, and 
neither should you,'' Tom Lehman said. ``When he died on Monday, a 
big part of us died, too.''

<HEADLINE> Pamela Anderson Back With Tommy Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A year and a half after her breakup with rocker  
Tommy Lee, Pamela Anderson Lee says being back home with him is not 
``all roses,'' but is ``not a dangerous situation'' either. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson left her husband in 1998 after a highly-publicized  
fight. Lee pleaded no contest to kicking his then-estranged wife 
several times during a fight while she held their toddler son, 
Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
	In the issue of ``Jane'' magazine set to hit newsstands next  
month, the former ``Baywatch'' beauty says Lee is learning to 
communicate better, in part through anger management classes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all roses or anything, because there's a lot of pain  
that Tommy and I need to resolve,'' she says. ``But seeing my two 
little boys so happy and playing with their daddy, it's just 
beautiful to have our family back together.''

<HEADLINE> Govt. Tries To Stop Computer Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department sued on Friday to block  
Michigan-based Compuware Corp.'s $168 million acquisition of 
Viasoft Inc. on grounds the deal could result in higher prices and 
diminished service for two types of critical mainframe computer 
software. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court here, the government  
alleged the deal would significantly reduce competition in the 
United States for mainframe testing and debugging software and for 
mainframe fault management software, which the government said is 
crucial for some mainframe computer users to maintain efficient 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	In July, Compuware agreed to pay $9 a share to acquire the  
Phoenix-based provider of information technology management. 
Compuware, based in Farmington Hills, Mich., provides management 
and development software. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Friday, Compuware said Viasoft and CV Acquisition  
Inc. -- a Compuware merger subsidiary -- have extended the offer to 
Nov. 5. It had been scheduled to expire Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Compuware said it is ``reviewing our options with counsel'' in  
light of the government's lawsuit. But the companies remain 
committed to completing their merger, Compuware said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department's announcement Friday ``completely  
mischaracterizes the marketplace for our software products,'' Peter 
Karmanos Jr., Compuware's chairman and chief executive, said in the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The DOJ has made it clear they don't understand what our  
products do or the dynamics of the mission-critical software 
marketplace. Unfortunately, they've compounded their error by 
choosing to file this lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government said Compuware is the world's dominant producer  
of mainframe testing and debugging software, with 60 percent of the 
market, and Viasoft is its closest rival and the only alternative 
to Compuserve for some consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Compuserve also dominates world sales of mainframe fault  
management software, with more 80 percent of the market, the 
government said. Viasoft is a recent entrant in this market with 
what the government called a promising, potentially significant 
competitive product. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint said that this is the latest in a series of  
Compuware acquisitions to acquire competitors' testing and 
debugging and fault management software, and the government said 
Compuware ceased sales and upgrades for those products after 
acquiring them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless this acquisition is blocked, buyers of this  
mission-critical software will be forced to pay higher prices and 
get less,'' said Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein, head of 
the antitrust division. ``We brought this suit to preserve the 
benefits of competition for the consumers that use these products -- 
universities, major companies and governmental entities.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Testing and debugging software is used to find errors as program  
code is being written and to fix code during production in the 
event of a processing failure. Fault management software detects 
and diagnoses errors that cause processing failures, which can save 
hours of labor and downtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Compuware had revenues of $1.6 billion in fiscal 1999. Viasoft  
has fiscal 1999 revenues of $104 million.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Ashcroft: End Race-Baiting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John Ashcroft said he is not responsible  
for circulating a 1960 photograph of Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan 
singing in blackface and called for an end to race-baiting in their 
2000 Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview Thursday, Ashcroft denied distributing the  
picture or knowing who circulated the image, which originally 
appeared in Carnahan's hometown newspaper almost 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor has accused Ashcroft of having his operatives  
quietly pass around the photo, which the Republican senator 
disputed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not put out such pictures and I will not allow my staff  
to do so, and I am very eager that we not have a campaign 
characterized by any association with race-baiting,'' Ashcroft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan has apologized for the small-town racial insensitivity  
of the blackface minstrel performance. The AP first reported the 
story Sunday, after obtaining the image from a GOP source on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft said that Sunday was the first he had heard about the  
photograph. As to whether the picture should have been distributed, 
Ashcroft said he is not judging anyone and can't answer for the 
actions of every Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	``The news industry can decide whether what they've printed is  
right or wrong, and people have every right to evaluate the public 
acts of public servants,'' Ashcroft said. ``I think Mel made a 
mistake, and I think he said he made a mistake and he apologized 
for it, and I think that's to his credit that he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he was proud of Missourians. ``I think we've come a  
long way from the 1960s,'' Ashcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator does not believe Carnahan is a racist, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked by the picture, and frankly, the picture does  
not square with my understanding of who Gov. Carnahan is,'' 
Ashcroft said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ashcroft blamed Carnahan for recent allegations of racism,  
arguing the governor was wrong to say Ashcroft's defeat of a black 
judge's judicial nomination had racial overtones. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator pointed out that two black Democratic lawmakers,  
Reps. Bill Clay of Missouri and Maxine Waters of California, 
labeled him a racist after the Senate Oct. 5 voted down the 
nomination of Missouri Supreme Court Judge Ronnie White. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft said he is disappointed that Carnahan would categorize  
him in the same way that Clay and Waters, ``his two colleagues,'' 
had. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnahan was traveling Thursday and could not be reached for a  
response, but campaign adviser Roy Temple said: ``We agree the 
race-baiting should stop, but in order for that to happen, John 
Ashcroft has to be willing to accept responsibility for the actions 
of people who report to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor has not called John Ashcroft a racist, nor has he  
implied John Ashcroft is a racist,'' said Temple, executive 
director of the state Democratic Party. ``It's an insult to the 
voters of Missouri for John Ashcroft, for four days, to allow 
people to act on his behalf, and then enter the discussion as if he 
were some kind of statesman.''

<HEADLINE> Golfers Flock to Orlando for Payne Crashed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By DOUG FERGUSON 	
</P>
<P>
                           *AP Golf Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Before beginning his eulogy for Payne  
Stewart today, Paul Azinger donned a tam o'shanter cap and rolled 
up his trousers to reveal a pair of argyle socks -- an outfit 
similar to his close friend's trademark look. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone laughed then applauded, the only time they did during a  
two-hour, gripping memorial service today at First Baptist Church 
attended by some 3,000 people, including friends, family and golf 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, the two-time U.S. Open champion, was among six people  
killed Monday when his Learjet soared uncontrolled until running 
out of fuel and crashing into a field in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Stewart was eulogized as a buoyant and gracious  
man with a passion for his family, his faith and for the game he 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart loved life,'' Azinger said. ``He was the life of  
every party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger joked that only Stewart could get him to wear a suit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt pressure this morning knowing he'd be watching,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Below the pulpit where Azinger spoke was the gold Ryder Cup,  
which normally never leaves PGA of America headquarters. There it 
sat, a standout on a table spread with some of Stewart's other 
prizes, including the Wanamaker trophy from his PGA triumph in 
1989, and the U.S. Open trophy, which he won in spectacular fashion 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Though all were special, the prize that meant the most to  
Stewart was the Ryder Cup, won in the greatest comeback in cup 
history last month by the United States for the first time since 
1993 --the last time Stewart was on the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart was a vicious competitor. He only played to  
win,'' Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that Stewart's attitude had changed recently after  
finding his faith, adding: ``Only God can change hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne became gracious in victory and gracious in defeat,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Crying, Azinger concluded by saying, ``Goodbye, Payne. We loved  
you and we miss you, but we know we will see you again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's widow, Tracey, spoke of how she fell for him when she  
met him. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the night of our first date, I can honestly tell you this  
is the man I wanted to share the rest of my life with,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of his devotion to their son and daughter, actively  
involved in their budding interest in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will always be my soulmate and my best friend. We love  
you. Let the party in heaven begin,'' she concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	As she left the church, Stewart's fellow golfers lined each side  
of the center aisle -- a protective wall for her to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour had canceled play at the Tour Championship and the  
Southern Farm Bureau Classic so players could attend the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that we're taking the day off so we can go to the  
service,'' said Hal Sutton, the defending champion at the Tour 
Championship in Houston. ``He deserves his day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 29 players in the Tour Championship already experienced  
the powerful emotions of paying tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first round began Thursday in Houston, players  
attended a brief but somber service on the first tee of Champions 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing 27 holes, many of them boarded private planes for  
a one-day trip to Orlando to say goodbye to Stewart one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very, very emotional for a lot of people,''  
said Davis Love III, whose father was killed in a plane crash 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Love and Tom Lehman were among those who thought about taking  
the entire week off until deciding it was best to be with their 
peers to start the grieving. After getting through a difficult day 
of golf in which the focus was far from birdies and bogeys, they 
will return to Houston on Saturday for another 27 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility exists that some will be so shook up, they will  
not want to return to Houston to resume the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see what the weekend brings,'' Love said. ``It's good  
for me to have a day off, but I don't know. You have to take each 
guy individually and see what they shot and how close they were to 
Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the European PGA Tour, players planned to pause for a moment  
of silence on the 18th green following today's round at the Volvo 
Masters in Jerez, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's impact on golf went far beyond his 18 victories around  
the world, including two U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. He was 
a member of five Ryder Cup teams and showed a passion for the 
matches like few others. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem recalled one of the last  
conversations he had with Stewart, right after the United States 
stormed from behind to win the Ryder Cup in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he had eight years left on the PGA Tour and then was  
going to play a full Senior Tour schedule,'' Finchem said. ``He was 
fully together and understood exactly where he was. He was in a 
crystal ball and could see where he was going. And I was delighted 
to know those knickers were going to be out here for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clothes were but a small part of the Stewart legacy.  
</P>
<P>
	He had the kind of flamboyant personality to wear the  
traditional golf garb -- the knickers and tam o'shanter cap often 
wore by Ben Hogan. At times, Stewart would wear a tie during 
pro-ams, which is what Walter Hagen and other great players in the 
early 20th century wore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was meticulous in the way he presented himself as a PGA  
Tour player,'' Finchem said. ``He felt so strongly about the 
importance to the presentation of our sport. He is in many ways 
irreplaceable from that perspective. He was a unique figure in 
sports and in golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For style alone, Finchem compared him to Hagen, ``a player who  
had this bigness, this presence about him, who dressed for the 
game, who brought excitement to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a substance to Stewart, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	He was perhaps the most successful player in the U.S. Open, the  
toughest championship in golf, during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won his first U.S. Open in 1991, beating Scott Simpson  
in an 18-hole playoff at Hazeltine in Minnesota. He also won in 
June at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, one of the most dramatic 
finishes in the 105-year history of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He had two other close calls in the U.S. Open, losing by two  
strokes to Lee Janzen at Baltusrol in 1993 and again finishing 
second to Janzen at The Olympic Club in San Francisco a year ago, 
when he failed to hold a 4-stroke lead going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry about me, boys,'' Stewart said at the time. ``I'll  
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept his word.

<HEADLINE> Ventura Denies Snubbing Buchanan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura said Friday that  
Republican turned Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan 
declined his offer for coffee during his two-day visit to the Twin 
Cities. Buchanan didn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on his weekly radio show, Ventura said he didn't snub  
Buchanan, who on Thursday made his first visit to Minnesota since 
leaving the GOP on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor said he was on his way to football practice -- he is  
a volunteer coach at Champlin Park High School -- when Buchanan's 
staff called him late Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he offered to have coffee with Buchanan on Friday  
morning for 45 minutes at the governor's residence, but Buchanan 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``They preferred a meeting with media and hoopla,'' Ventura  
said. ``I preferred a private meeting. They chose not to make it 
happen this morning.'' He added, ``I didn't snub anyone. I was busy 
doing my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan was in town Thursday for a book signing and a  
fund-raiser and left Friday morning. Buchanan said he was boarding 
a flight to Fargo, N.D., when he heard a radio report that Ventura 
was trying to get in touch with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's just chalk it up to inadequate staff work and leave it  
up to reporters to figure out which staff it was,'' Buchanan told 
KFGO Radio in Fargo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said Buchanan is welcome in the Reform Party, but  
has not embraced him as a candidate. He said he never spoke 
directly with Buchanan during the visit.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday that Israel and its  
Arab neighbors have a chance for peace ``within the reasonable near 
future'' but warned that the opportunity is fleeting and could be 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the moment that we must seize,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made the comment two days before heading to Norway to  
meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat at a tribute to slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin, assassinated four years ago by an Israeli opponent of the 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the annual dinner of the Anti-Defamation League, the  
president said, ``We actually have a chance within the reasonable 
near future for peace for Israel and its neighbors. ...But like all 
chances in life, it is fleeting. It will require hard choices and 
hard work within a short time frame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat and Barak have set a deadline of next February to reach a  
broad outline for solving the toughest disputes in the Middle East 
and for getting a final agreement by September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe that we're either going to go forward or drift  
backward,'' Clinton said. ``We can't just freeze this moment. The 
region still could reverse course. There are still plenty of 
extremists and terrorists out there. ...Make no mistake about it, 
our problems with the enemies of peace, the terrorists, are far 
from over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that within 10 years, there will be a sophisticated  
alliance around the world of terrorists, drug runners and organized 
crime, ``maximizing the same modern technologies that we all seek 
to access to do good.''

<HEADLINE> Big Waves in Pacific Kill Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Waves up to 25 feet pounded the West Coast,  
killing at least two people, including a bride swept to sea at 
Lover's Point as her husband took photos during their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Eamon Stookesberry, 28, of Concord, dove in after his  
23-year-old wife, Jennifer, but couldn't reach her. Rescuers, on 
the scene within minutes, pulled them both from the water near 
Pacific Grove, just outside Monterey and 85 miles south of San 
Francisco. Mrs. Stookesberry was pronounced dead in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had married Saturday and were on the last day of  
their honeymoon, the groom's brother, Jude Stookesberry, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Eamon Stookesberry is a house painter; his wife worked in a  
hospital and planned to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to run from it, but it got them,'' said A.J. Young,  
who was watching and immediately called 911 on his cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed was a 20-year-old surfer, Danny Jordan, near Santa  
Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have 20-foot swells and 25-foot waves, we have  
vicious rip tides,'' said Owen Miller, a Capitola Fire Department 
battalion chief. ``It sounds like he was knocked around pretty 
heavily by incoming waves and wasn't able to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swirling storm, 600 to 800 miles in diameter, sat off the  
coast for at least a day before moving toward land Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The waves hit the coasts of Washington and Oregon before dawn  
then worked south, slamming the coast near Capitola in early 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Feared lost was an unidentified man last seen Wednesday on a  
40-foot sailboat that lost a mast in high seas and heavy winds 
about 560 miles off the Pacific Coast. Two Coast Guard vessels, one 
equipped with a helicopter, were expected to reach the scene by 
Saturday to continue the search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had no information on where the sailboat had  
originated or how many people may be on board, said Petty Officer 
Veronica Bandrowsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful waves, which reached 40 feet in parts of Northern  
California, lured spectators to the shores. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not just surf,'' said Santa Cruz harbor port director  
Brian Foss. ``This was a surge, a huge pulse in the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It destroyed boats and forced driftwood onto the streets of  
Monterey. Water, mud and seaweed covered famous 17-Mile Drive in 
Pebble Beach. The ocean topped the Capitola sea wall, forcing 
wharf, restaurant and hotel evacuations.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Rise on Brazil Dryness / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean futures edged upward Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade after forecasts predicted a dry weekend for 
parched growing regions of Brazil. Grains were mostly lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybean prices, lagging near two-month lows, also were boosted  
by a long-rumored U.S. export sale to China and a possible one to 
Taiwan. China's northern Shandong province purchased 50,000 tons of 
U.S. soybeans and traders said there were rumors of more Chinese 
purchases coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures remained hovering right around the $2.00-a-bushel  
level, with few developments to budge it from that benchmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat was pressured by rain that improved crop conditions in  
Argentina and by forecasts of increasing precipitation in the U.S. 
winter wheat belt this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 1 1/2 cents to $2.55 3/4 a bushel;  
December corn was unchanged at $1.99 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cent to $1.10 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans rose 4 3/4 cents to 
$4.70 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef and pork futures advanced in trading on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	December live cattle rose .23 cent to 68.65 cents a pound;  
November feeder cattle rose .57 cent to 80.97 cents a pound; 
December lean hogs rose .57 cent to 46.52 cents a pound; February 
frozen pork bellies rose .17 cent to 61.32 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Speaks to Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALCOTT, N.D. (AP) -- American farmers are ``getting the shaft''  
because their government won't force other countries to open their 
markets, Reform Party presidential hopeful Pat Buchanan said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to about 40 farmers from a hay bale stack on a farm  
near here, Buchanan said that, as president, he would close 
America's markets to products from countries that limit imports of 
U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the biggest problem ... is everyone can come into our  
country, but we can't go into their markets,'' Buchanan said. ``The 
government of the United States is not doing what it can do or 
should do to break open the markets of the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan, who this week left the Republican Party to seek the  
Reform Party nomination for president, was on a brief campaign 
swing through North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said that while he originally supported  
Republican-backed Freedom to Farm legislation, he now believes it 
is not working. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would,'' he said. ``But it's obviously not. ...  
There's almost no farmer in America today who is getting a price 
for the commodity that he produces that covers the price of 
production.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law was intended to make farmers less dependent on  
government assistance. But commodity prices dropped sharply last 
year and Congress has responded by passing successive bailout 
packages worth nearly $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said lawmakers need to tackle the problem from the  
market side. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solution lies in foreign markets,'' he said. ``The U.S.  
government isn't using its leverage to open them.''

<HEADLINE> Skater Weiss Gunning for Big Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Michael Weiss was carrying  
shopping bags filled with presents at the World Arena. How 
appropriate -- he's a father again. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Weiss, wife of the current U.S. figure skating champion,  
gave birth to Christopher Michael, the couple's second child, last 
week. Daddy was glowing as he spoke before Skate America began 
Friday with the short programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been amazing, a great year for me,'' said Weiss, who won  
his first U.S. crown in February, took a silver medal at worlds in 
March, then was honored with the 1999 Father of the Year award by 
the National Fatherhood Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time you have a happy individual, you have a happy  
athlete. If you are comfortable with your life off the ice, you are 
a better athlete on the ice. It's carried over for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, Weiss has achieved something more, and now the  
23-year-old skater wants to become the first American to win a 
world title since Todd Eldredge in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At Skate America, the first major international event of the  
season, he faces two of his toughest rivals, two-time world 
champion Alexei Yagudin of Russia and three-time world winner Elvis 
Stojko of Canada. To outperform them, Weiss thinks he needs to make 
an early impression, starting with this competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goals are the same -- capturing the judges' attention early  
in the year,'' he said. ``Now that I'm one of the world 
championship medalists, I have to win events early in the year to 
move up. If I want to be a world champion, they will know I've 
beaten these skaters in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Skate America is always a great competition. It's a good test  
to feel each other out and see what you're doing and what they are 
doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Weiss will not be doing is more than one quadruple jump in  
his free skate; he also planned one in the short program. Several 
other skaters, including countryman Tim Goebel -- the first American 
to land a quad in competition -- will showcase more than one quad in 
their free skates. 
</P>
<P>
	But with a quad and eight triple jumps, plus his improving  
artistry, Weiss thinks he has more than enough ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, you seem to be rewarded by skating cleanly,'' he  
said. ``With one quad and eight triples, that seems to be what will 
win the worlds if you skate cleanly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss hoped to bring along 13-month-old daughter Annie-Mae, but  
she developed a sinus infection and stayed home in Fairfax, Va. So 
papa is going it alone this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``You miss them, especially when the baby is new,'' he said,  
noting that Christopher was placed in intensive care for a few days 
when he developed breathing problems. But Christopher was home by 
Monday, and Michael headed west. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to return home not only with all those store-bought  
gifts, but a Skate America gold medal, too.

<HEADLINE> Papis Hoping for Strong CART Finish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Max Papis can still feel the  
disappointment in the pit of his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian driver overwhelmed the field in July in the U.S. 500  
at Michigan Speedway, leading 143 of 250 laps, before running out 
of fuel while out front on the last trip around the two-mile, 
high-banked oval. 
</P>
<P>
	That gave the victory to Tony Kanaan, CART's top rookie last  
season, and left Papis with an empty feeling and a renewed sense of 
determination to get to the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old Papis will get another chance on Sunday in the  
season-ending Marlboro 500 at California Speedway, a virtual carbon 
copy of its sister track in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Papis, yet to win a race in four seasons in CART, was asked if  
his showing at Michigan makes him feel like a favorite here. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, in my heart, I'm always the favorite,'' the onetime  
sports car star said. ``Michigan is just the proof that we can do a 
good job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although the spotlight this week is mostly on the championship  
battle between leader Dario Franchitti and rookie Juan Montoya, 
trailing by nine points, Papis would like to steal some of the 
thunder in the season's only other 500-mile event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success at Michigan really doesn't give us any kind of  
distinct advantage,'' said Papis, completing his first season with 
Team Rahal and coming off a career-best second two weeks ago at 
Surfers Paradise, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I haven't been able to accomplish this season  
that was a goal of mine coming in was to win a race,'' said Papis, 
who replaced new boss Bobby Rahal in the cockpit following Rahal's 
retirement as a driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know a lot of people have told me that I won Michigan, but I  
am not looking for moral victories. I want my name on paper as 
having won a race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Practice began Friday and Papis' Reynard-Ford was second only to  
Englishman Mark Blundell's Reynard-Mercedes. Blundell turned a fast 
lap of 235.292 mph and Papis hit 234.747, both in the first of two 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya, who leads everyone this season with seven victories in  
19 starts, was third overall at 233.539 in the morning and led the 
slower afternoon session -- marked by gusty winds -- at 230.707 in 
his backup Reynard-Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, who didn't take the lead in the driver standings  
from Montoya until winning in Australia, was 11th overall at 
232.269 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good day,'' Montoya said. ``We were just trying to  
find a nice race car, but it's very difficult to find out how fast 
you are until qualifying because everybody drafts each other in 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not too worried about speed, though,'' said Montoya, who  
goes into Saturday's qualifying with a series-high seven poles. 
``My main goal is trying to beat Dario.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Franchitti, like Montoya looking for his first series title,  
said, ``We're just trying to get our work done and be ready to race 
on Sunday. We'll be ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell was pleased with his fast lap, but readily admitted he  
had some help. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard not to get at least a little tow out there in  
practice,'' Blundell said. ``But I don't think we had too much 
help, so I'm pretty pleased. We should be in good shape for 
qualifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie Naoki Hattori of Japan was airlifted to a hospital for  
precautionary tests after crashing during the morning practice. Dr. 
Steve Olvey, director of medical affairs for CART, said Hattori was 
awake and alert and apparently was uninjured.

<HEADLINE> Garbageman Wants Cleaner Mass. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- Eddie Johnson's campaign to clean up  
city government begins each morning with the 54-year-old candidate 
for mayor hanging onto the back of a garbage truck. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows more about cleaning up the city?'' Johnson, a  
garbageman, said recently as trash trucks rumbled into the dump. 
``We pick up 13 tons of garbage each day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson admits beating Mayor Frederick M. Kalisz Jr. on Tuesday  
is about as likely as finding a million-dollar lottery ticket on 
his morning rounds, but he takes a measure of confidence knowing he 
came in second in the Oct. 5 primary. (A distant second. Kalisz 
outpolled him 16-to-1.) 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson, a self-described conservative Republican, said he  
is assured of winning one thing Tuesday: name recognition that 
could come in handy for a future political run. Six years ago, he 
ran for ward councilor and came in dead last. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has waged a low-cost campaign that includes asking for  
votes on his garbage route when he's not talking trash. He has also 
relied on bumper stickers and posters. 
</P>
<P>
	As the race entered its final weekend, few voters said they had  
heard much about Johnson or from him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't even know the mayor had an opponent,'' said Margaret  
Barboza. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, originally from Syracuse, N.Y., said he holds  
certificates from a two-year program in labor relations and 
management at Rutgers University and a six-month program in labor 
organization and community service at Cornell University. He worked 
at a youth center before becoming a garbageman two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He has leveled accusations of corruption in city government and  
said he wants to create jobs. He has claimed Kalisz has not done 
enough to attract business and tourism, though that message may be 
ill-timed. 
</P>
<P>
	The onetime whaling port of about 100,000 had one of the state's  
highest unemployment levels in recent years but has seen signs of 
recovery. The jobless rate dipped to a 10-year low in August, 
construction of a maritime freight terminal is almost finished, and 
city officials are rehabilitating the waterfront, including 
building an $80 million aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a very solid two years,'' said Kalisz, who added he  
isn't worried about winning re-election Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is unfazed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If people are tired of the government and tired of this  
administration, all they have to do is vote,'' he said. ``I'm just 
asking people to vote.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 109.23; New Nasdaq High / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a new high,  
leading a broad stock market rally that was extended today on 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's suggestion that the Fed's 
two interest rate hikes this year seem to be keeping inflation 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks raised hopes that the central bank may not see the  
need for repeated additional rate hikes to keep the economy from 
overheating. Interest rates tumbled today on the 
inflation-sensitive government bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was up 107.33 at 10,729.86, adding to its 227.64-point 
surge on Thursday. The Dow ended the week up 261.51 points, or 2.5 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite  
index was up 91.30 at 2,966.52, well above the record close of 
2,915.95 reached on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 20.49 to 1,362.93.  
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,178 up, 971 down and 408 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 1.08 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.12  
billion in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.82 to 428.63.  
</P>
<P>
	Today's rally on Wall Street came on the 70th anniversary of the  
1929 stock market crash, when the Dow plunged 11.73 percent in a 
single session. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, in a speech at a Florida meeting of business  
executives late Thursday, said a significant upturn in the growth 
of productivity in recent years has boosted the U.S. economy and 
kept inflationary pressures under control. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that the Fed's two interest rate hikes this summer  
are keeping the economy on a path of noninflationary growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This process of containment may already be significantly  
advanced,'' Greenspan said in citing the impact higher market 
interest rates could be having. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Fed will raise interest rates for the third time this 
year when its policy-makers meet on Nov. 16. Some traders had 
worried about prospects for more increases down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan didn't say what the Fed will do. He also warned that  
the central bank will be particularly alert in the coming months to 
any signs of slowing productivity -- the amount of output per hour 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Greenspan suggested that he needs to see more  
evidence the economy is slowing in order to keep the central bank 
from raising interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported Thursday that economic activity was  
strong in the third quarter without signs of renewed inflation, 
figures that fueled the market's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the midst of a big rally, and it should carry  
through over several more sessions,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior 
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``But that doesn't mean that 
this is going to last. We still have a bunch of big hurdles ahead 
of us before the Fed's next meeting in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, the buyers are quick on the trigger, but so are the  
sellers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Intel rose on the Nasdaq Stock Market after the  
world's largest maker of computer chips, said production of its 
products this year will not be disrupted by the earthquake in 
Taiwan or the Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin shares tumbled after the defense conglomerate  
slashed its earnings estimate for the year 2000 and its president 
and chief operating officer, Peter B. Teets, announced his 
retirement, blaming himself for the earnings shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Akamai Technologies, a maker of technology used to  
boost the efficiency of the Internet, soared in an initial public 
offering. Akamai was priced at 26 per share, opened at 110, and 
closed at 145 3/16 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in  
Charlotte, N.C., noted that the technology sector completely 
dominated today's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market does look impressive,'' he said. ``But it has to  
find some other leadership beyond the techs and the financial 
stocks. When they're the only two groups driving the market, it 
doesn't signify a lot of strength.''

<HEADLINE> Key Figure Probed at Minnesota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Alonzo Newby, a key figure in the  
investigation into academic cheating in the University of Minnesota 
men's basketball program, says investigators don't really want to 
know what he knows, the Saint Paul Pioneer Press reported Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	But university President Mark Yudof called Newby's statement,  
``absolutely a lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The University of Minnesota never seriously made an attempt to  
get me to come forward,'' said the former academic counselor in a 
statement to the Pioneer Press and reported on the newspaper's Web 
site. 
</P>
<P>
	This past week, Yudof banned the basketball team from postseason  
play for one year and also placed the program on probation. The 
NCAA may impose its own sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigation started after former tutor Jan Gangelhoff  
claimed she wrote or helped write about 400 academic papers for 
basketball players. Newby said Gangelohoff's claims are ``but a 
piece of a much larger pie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newby wanted the university to pay him three years' salary -- or  
about $132,000 -- for his testimony. He was fired for not 
cooperating with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides agree that negotiations that could lead to Newby's  
testimony have so far failed. Newby, through his attorney Ron 
Rosenbaum, said the university never made a counterproposal to his 
offer to talk in exchange for the money and a guarantee that the 
university would protect him from civil or criminal litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Yudof, who maintains that paying for testimony is unethical,  
issued a statement Friday night, saying investigators will meet 
Newby at his convenience and at university expense to obtain 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll go anywhere, any time to meet with Newby,'' Yudof said.  
``We've requested his testimony on many occasions, and we would be 
grateful for his cooperation, but under no circumstances will we 
pay Alonzo Newby for his testimony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse is frustrating because Newby is in a position to  
know a great deal about the scandal, Yudof said, and he would like 
to hear what he has to say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he probably has relevant testimony that we might not  
stir up someplace else, Yudof said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of an investigation done by an outside law firm is due  
to Yudof Monday. The university expects to forward its report to 
the NCAA in mid-November. The NCAA will then conduct its own 
investigation. But the NCAA's action may depend heavily on the 
university's report. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the crux of Newby's charge is that the  
university does not want to learn about an even wider net of 
misconduct, for fear of the NCAA's punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key to a tidy conclusion of this mess has always been  
dependent upon me pursuing one of two strategies: deny everything 
by lying or refuse to cooperate,'' Newby said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sends Y2K Guide to Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's government is mailing all of the  
city-state's 950,000 homes a guide on how to protect a household 
against the dreaded Y2K computer glitch, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The glossy, four-page ``Y2K Guide'' gives step-by-step  
instructions on testing personal computers and household 
appliances, such as videocassette recorders and fax machines, for 
Y2K resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	There are worldwide fears that computer chips that read only the  
last two digits of the year may fail on Jan. 1, 2000, triggering 
chaos in systems from banks to airports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Singaporeans probably will face nothing more drastic than  
missing a TV show, officials on the island republic said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to record a certain program, let's say at 2 a.m.  
on the first of January 2000, if (your VCR) is not Y2K-compliant, 
it will not be recorded,'' said Alan Chan, permanent secretary for 
Singapore's Ministry of Communications and Information Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But all of the country's essential, public services have been  
ready for the date switch since the middle of 1999, Chan said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore authorities have assured the public that banks,  
transportation, utilities and other vital systems passed rigorous 
Y2K tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Y2K Guide notes that it is always wise to ``keep  
manual copies of electronically stored information,'' such as phone 
numbers and financial records. ``There is no need for you to stock 
food,'' it says.

                          *Rafael Alberti    	
</P>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Rafael Alberti, a renowned poet and the  
last survivor of Spain's Generation of '27 artistic group, died 
Thursday. He was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	The Generation of '27 was a loosely-knit group that included  
such writers as Federico Garcia Lorca, Juan Ramon Jimenez and Jorge 
Guillen, artists such as Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali and 
filmmaker Luis Bunuel. 
</P>
<P>
	The group took its name from the year -- 1927 -- when Alberti and  
other literary figures met in Seville to pay homage to 17th century 
Spanish poet Luis de Gongora. Its members became some of the 
leading protagonists of the Surrealist movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Alberti became a member of Spain's Communist Party and was  
heavily involved in leftist politics in the 1930s. He started the 
revolutionary magazine Octubre (October) in 1934. 
</P>
<P>
	He is also survived by his wife and daughter.

<P>
	EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Forrest ``Forddy'' Anderson, the  
former Michigan State basketball coach who led the Spartans to the 
Final Four in 1957, died Monday from complications of pneumonia. He 
was 80. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson coached from 1954-65. He had a 125-124 record that  
included a tie for the Big Ten title in 1956-57 and an outright 
championship in 1958-59. He was fired in 1965 after a 5-18 season 
and a last-place finish in the conference.

                       *Theodore H. Benzinger    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Theodore H. Benzinger, inventor of the ear  
thermometer and a pioneer in the field of biothermodynamics, died 
Tuesday. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzinger became director of aero-medical department of the  
German air force in 1934. During the next decade, he studied 
decompression and physiology in pilots and was a test pilot 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	After World War II, Benzinger joined the U.S. Naval Medical  
Research Institute in Bethesda, where his discoveries included the 
thermodynamic quantities of biochemical reactions and the mechanism 
for measuring temperatures in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzinger held patents for a dozen inventions. He retired from  
the Naval Research Medical Institute in 1970 as director of its 
bioenergetics division but continued working at the National 
Institutes of Standards and Technology.

                          *Leonard E. Boyle    	
</P>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- The Rev. Leonard E. Boyle, who led the Vatican  
Library into the age of computer catalogues and gift merchandising 
before leaving under cloudy circumstances, died Monday. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Vatican, he oversaw the world's largest collection of  
ancient manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
	During his 13 years as keeper of manuscripts and chief  
librarian, Boyle modernized the library, computerizing its old 
catalogues, wiring the main reading room for laptops and trying to 
make money by selling the rights to its warehouse of images. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyle was in charge of the library when Ohio State University  
professor Anthony Melnikas stole pages from an ancient manuscript 
once owned by the 14th century Italian poet Francesco Petrach. 
</P>
<P>
	Melnikas was sentenced to 14 months in prison and fined $3,000  
for stealing two pages at the Vatican Library and three at Spanish 
cathedral libraries. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the Vatican was forced to pay the equivalent of $8.8  
million plus $1.3 million in attorney's fees to settle a lawsuit 
that resulted from Boyle's sale of exclusive rights to reproduce 
library images. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear if the two incidents led the Vatican to dismiss  
Boyle in 1997 or if he accepted early retirement.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Frank DeVol, who wrote scores for more than  
50 films and won Oscar nominations for ``Hush ... Hush, Sweet 
Charlotte,'' ``Pillow Talk'' and ``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' 
died Wednesday. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his motion picture scores, DeVol wrote theme  
music for the television shows ``My Three Sons'' and ``The Brady 
Bunch,'' among others. 
</P>
<P>
	He also took on roles as a character actor, appearing in  
``Parent Trap,'' ``Fernwood Tonight,'' ``I'm Dickens, He's 
Fenster'' and ``Silver Spoons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He later wrote radio studio arrangements for such stars as Rudy  
Vallee, Ginny Simms and Jack Carson. He then moved to Capitol 
Records and did arrangements for Doris Day, Kay Starr, Tony Bennett 
and Vic Damone, among others.

	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Ben Johnson, who grew up poor in  
Texas and wound up one of the biggest real estate deal makers in 
Palm Beach, died Friday of cancer. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson joked that his childhood in Dallas was so poor his only  
toy was an old mayonnaise jar. But in 1980, he sold the El Solano 
oceanfront mansion to Yoko Ono and John Lennon. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Johnson's wealthy and much older wife of two decades,  
Johanna C.C. ``Ancky'' Johnson, sued for divorce. He requested 
alimony sufficient to maintain the lifestyle he had come to enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges of drug use and extramarital affairs made the messy  
split the talk of the island. Still, the two remained friends and 
Johnson was at his ex-wife's bedside when she died three years ago.

Advocate sports editor whose career in newspaper journalism spanned 
64 years, died Thursday. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	Montet became sports editor of the State-Times, the city's  
afternoon paper, in 1941, six months after he joined the Advocate's 
staff. He became sports editor of the Morning Advocate in February 
1949. He wrote six columns a week for nearly 40 years, even after 
he retired in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Montet is survived by a sister, Louise Montet Lee; a  
brother-in-law, Carter Russell Lee; a brother, Charles M. Montet;

<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Abraham Polonsky, a director and  
Oscar-nominated screenwriter who worked under pseudonyms and used 
other writers as fronts after being blacklisted in McCarthy-era 
Hollywood, was found dead Tuesday after suffering a heart attack. 
He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Polonsky was blacklisted for nearly two decades and had only  
nine films to his credit. He earned an Oscar nomination for writing 
the 1947 John Garfield boxing film ``Body and Soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1950s, Polonsky's career was disrupted after he  
refused to testify about his Communist Party affiliations or name 
party members. His refusal prompted 20th Century Fox to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
	Though blacklisted, Polonsky never completely abandoned  
Hollywood. His best known work as an outcast scribe was the 1959 
crime melodrama ``Odds Against Tomorrow,'' which he co-wrote under 
the name John O. Killens. In 1996, the Writers Guild of America 
restored his real name to the credits.

turned his father's business into one of the nation's largest 
solid-waste collection and disposal operations, died Monday from 
complications of Hodgkins disease. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	He founded Rabanco Cos. in 1981. When the company was sold last

contracts with 19 Washington state communities and was transporting 
solid waste from as far north as Ketchikan, Alaska, and as far 
south as Napa, Calif.

<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Victor Van Bourg, who helped found one of  
the nation's top labor law firms, died of an apparent heart attack 
on Tuesday as he left a plane at San Francisco International 
Airport. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	He rose from picket lines to establish one of the nation's top  
labor law firms, Oakland-based Van Bourg, Weinberg, Roger &AMP; 
Rosenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm employs 35 lawyers representing more than 400 unions  
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	He represented Cesar Chavez's National Farm Workers Union in its  
1966 merger with the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee. Two 
years ago, his firm was one of the first to sue tobacco companies 
on behalf of health and welfare trust funds.

<P>
	CARMEL, Calif. (AP) -- Retired Sgt. Maj. Walter Francis Skees,  
who sang for seven presidents in the White House as the Army's top 
vocalist, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
	Skees was a soldier from 1955 to 1983. He entertained Presidents  
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954, at 19, he was drafted into the Army, where he won a  
contest to select the service's best vocalist, following such 
notables as Eddie Fisher and Steve Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	Nixon was a special fan, according to Skees' wife, Patricia. He  
would often ask the singing soldier to perform on the presidential 
yacht. 
</P>
<P>
	Skees also sang at Carnegie Hall and Radio City Music Hall and  
on television shows hosted by Bob Hope, Steve Allen, Merv Griffin 
and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Skees recorded several albums, including one featuring favorite  
songs of the president's wives, and another with guitarist Charlie 
Byrd called ``A Little Tenderness.''

<HEADLINE> Sabres 3, Panthers 2, OT / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Geoff Sanderson scored with 5.5 seconds  
left in overtime to give the Buffalo Sabres a 3-2 win over the 
Florida Panthers on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanderson took a pass from Curtis Brown and fired the puck past  
Florida goaltender Trevor Kidd for his fourth career overtime goal 
and first for the Sabres. His last game-winner in OT came against 
Buffalo in February 1996, when Sanderson played for Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
	Stu Barnes scored the tying goal with 18 seconds left in  
regulation, knocking in a loose puck during a scramble in front of 
the Florida net with the Buffalo goaltender pulled for an extra 
skater. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes' goal came just 15 seconds after Bret Hedican ripped a  
slap shot past Dominik Hasek to give Panthers a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek was injured on Hedican's goal, which rattled in off the  
left post. The goaltender did a split while trying to make the save 
and was down for several minutes before being assisted to the 
bench. He was replaced by Martin Biron, who made four saves in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Peca also scored for Buffalo, and Ray Whitney scored  
Florida's first goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has struggled throughout the season and even looked shaky  
in Wednesday's 4-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning, his first 
win of the season, in which he allowed three goals on 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers didn't make Hasek work hard this time until the  
third, when the Sabres were outshot 12-11. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo outshot Florida 20-9 through two periods and the  
Panthers managed only three shots in the first, tying their season 
low for shots in a period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres scored the first goal 5:37 into the game when Peca  
worked a give-and-go with Vaclav Varada and rifled the puck past 
Trevor Kidd at 5:37. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitney tied it at 7:06 with his fifth goal of the season.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres were in the middle of a defensive line change on the  
play and their forwards lost the puck in the neutral zone. A pass 
from former Sabres defenseman Mike Wilson sent Whitney in alone 
through the left circle, and the soft wrist shot fluttered over 
Hasek's glove. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek stuffed Pavel Bure's wraparound with a minute left in the  
second. 
</P>
<P>
	Kidd, who had allowed 19 goals in six games against Buffalo,  
posting a 1-4 record and a 3.29 goals-against average, made two big 
saves on a Buffalo power play early in the third. First he got a 
pad on Zhitnik's shot from the point and stopped Jason Woolley on 
the rebound. He also turned back Satan with 1:13 left. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres survived 1:27 of a power play midway through the  
third including 8 seconds of a five-on-three. Hasek made four saves 
on the power play, including a stop on Svehla on a point-blank 
shot.

<HEADLINE> State Farm Agents Seek Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thirty-nine current and former State Farm  
agents appealed to Congress Friday to investigate the insurance 
giant, claiming the company has abused policyholders and agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bloomington, Ill.-based company called the complaints ``wild  
accusations,'' mostly made by agents involved in a lawsuit against 
the company. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge in California recently issued a summary judgment  
in favor of State Farm's right to institute various programs and 
procedures to recover from losses from Hurricane Andrew and the 
Northridge earthquake. Agents complained the procedures were unfair 
to them and are appealing the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Other portions of that lawsuit still pending concern the  
company's right to terminate agents and the issue of whether 
company policies are fair to policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	``These wild accusations are hurtful and are an outright slap in  
the face,'' said Harold Gray, State Farm's regional vice president 
for the area that includes Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, in a statement, said the news conference called by  
the agents was ``a sad distraction caused by a few dozen people -- 
most of them disgruntled former agents with a litigation-inspired 
motive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pia Pialorsi, a spokeswoman for the Senate Commerce Committee,  
where the letter was sent, said officials there had not yet seen 
the letter but ``it is something the committee would look into.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agents complained that the company has a history of fraud  
and deception. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notion of State Farm as an honest, neighborly company no  
longer exists,'' said a letter from the agents to Sen. John McCain, 
R-Ariz., chairman of the Commerce Committee. ``The current 
management of State Farm has, instead, repeatedly abused the 
policyholders and its independent agents for too long in order to 
gain unwarranted financial advantage for itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agents noted in the letter that the company is involved in  
numerous lawsuits. A judge and jury in Marion, Ill., in separate 
rulings this month awarded State Farm auto insurance customers a 
total of $1.2 billion because the insurer used generic replacement 
parts in auto body repairs. Company officials maintain that State 
Farm abides by regulations on use of such parts in every state 
where it does business.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Sprewell Accepts Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell has decided to accept  
the New York Knicks' offer of a five-year, $61.9 million contract 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, also offered a two-year, $21 million deal, made the  
announcement before the Knicks' 106-103 loss to the New Jersey Nets 
on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Wednesday, he was believed to have been leaning  
towards the shorter contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy with the numbers in the five-year deal,'' Sprewell  
said. ``I feel more secure with that. That's what I feel more 
comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I had taken the two-year, I would have been  
wondering if it was the right thing. In the back of my mind I would 
have been thinking, `Let's stay healthy.' I just want to go out and 
play and not worry about being healthy because my contract is up in 
a couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Sprewell will earn $9 million this season, the  
final year of the four-year deal he signed with Golden State three 
years ago. His new contract, which includes an opt-out clause after 
four years, will kick in next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was expected to sign the new deal as early as today.

	Violent 'Plot' Closes Ohio School  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Authorities ordered a high school closed today  
and arrested four students, saying they uncovered an apparent 
racist plot by students to stage ``violent acts'' there. Several 
South High School students admitted planning an attack with guns 
and explosives, similar to the one carried out by two students at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., last April, The Plain 
Dealer reported today. Mayor Michael R. White this afternoon said 
two guns were confiscated when police carried out four search 
warrants last night, but no firearms or explosives were found at 
the school.

stamp out the Falun Gong, pitching both sides toward more public 
confrontation. Evidence of the escalating tensions was on display 
today in Tiananmen Square. As teams of police rushed to round up 
Falun Gong members, a few college-age followers daringly unveiled a 
petition asking Chinese leaders for tolerance. Police hauled away 
at least 50 people, adding to the 3,000 a Communist Party source 
said have been detained in Beijing this week.

Hurricane Floyd's floodwaters last month. The storm packed up to 20

	NEW YORK (AP) -- With Halloween falling on a Sunday this year,  
many communities are holding trick-or-treating tomorrow night 
instead. In some cases its because they don't want youngsters 
dressing up as demons on the Lord's day. Others note that Sunday is 
a school night or that daylight-saving time ends at 2 a.m. Sunday. 
In Salt Lake City, celebrations haven't been officially banned on

day. The Chicago suburb of Harvey moved trick-or-treating to 
tomorrow, as did the Missouri towns of Fayette and Boonville.

four years for the Yankees, who assured their place as the team of 
the '90s and the team of the century by sweeping the Atlanta Braves

	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Anaheim Mighty Ducks acquired Tony  
Hrkac and Dean Malkoc in a trade Friday that sent Ted Drury to the 
New York Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
	Hrkac, a 33-year-old center, has two assists in seven games with  
the Islanders after signing as a free agent last summer. 
</P>
<P>
	He played in 69 games last season for the NHL champion Dallas  
Stars, with 13 goals and 14 assists. He added two assists in five 
playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-round draft pick by St. Louis in the 1984 NHL entry  
draft, Hrkac has 252 career points. 
</P>
<P>
	Drury, 28, played 11 games for the Mighty Ducks this season,

<HEADLINE> Two Gain Upsets at Breeders Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMPBELLVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- CR Renegade and Grinfromeartoear  
clouded the harness horse of year picture Friday night with upsets 
in two of the Breeders Crown divisional championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed and Blissfull Hall were among the heaviest  
favorites in the eight races at Mohawk Raceway and both had a 
strong claim to the yearly honor. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed, the fastest trotter in history and winner of the  
Hambletonian, was the 1-9 favorite in the $400,000 Breeders Crown 
3-year-old Colt Trot but he ran out of gas in the stretch and was 
overtaken by CR Renegade. 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall, the Pacing Triple Crown winner, was overtaken in  
the stretch by Grinfromeartoear, and wound up a disappointing third 
in the $400,000 Breeders Crown 3-year-old Colt Pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The other winners Friday night were: Oolong, bred by New York  
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, in the $400,000 Breeders Crown 
3-year-old Filly Trot; Tyberwood in the $560,100 Breeders Crown 
2-year-old Colt Pace; Odies Fame, a $45,000 supplement to the 
Breeders Crown, in the $520,000 3-year-old Filly Pace; Eternal 
Camnation in the $433,900 Breeders Crown 2-year-old Filly Pace; 
Dream Of Joy, a 34-1 long shot, in the $443,600 Breeders Crown 
2-year-old Filly Trot; and Master Lavec in the $450,700 Breeders 
Crown 2-year-old Colt Trot. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Allen drove CR Renegade to victory in 1:54.2. Self Possessed  
finished fifth in his final career start, but was placed eighth for 
making an extended break at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Self Possessed ended his career with nine wins in 14 starts,  
including two-thirds of the Trotting Triple Crown, the Hambletonian 
and Kentucky Futurity. He bypassed the first leg, the Yonkers Trot, 
which was won by CR Renegade. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was fine in the post parade and fine in the warmup,'' said  
Self Possessed's driver Mike Lachance. ``He just didn't have it 
tonight, he wasn't himself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall, the 2-5 favorite, had taken the lead from  
Grinfromeartoear just past the quarter pole and led until the final 
push to the wire, then finished third behind Island Fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew we were in trouble around the first turn,'' said Ben  
Wallace, trainer of Blissfull Hall. ``It wasn't his type of race. 
I'm disappointed, but not discouraged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blissfull Hall, who has won 13 of his 19 starts this year,  
became the ninth pacer to win the Triple Crown, when he won the 
Cane Pace, Little Brown Jug and Messenger Stakes. His connections 
were hoping a Breeders Crown win would cement at least a share of 
the Horse of the Year honors with Self Possessed. 
</P>
<P>
	The win for Grinfromeartoear was the colt's ninth in 21 starts,  
and raised his seasonal earnings to $731,635. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the drivers won in the first Breeders Crown appearance:  
Eric Ledford behind Eternal Camnation, Jim Meittinis with Dream Of 
Joy, and Dan Daley steering Master Lavec. 
</P>
<P>
	The win was the 12th in a row for Eternal Camnation, who has not  
lost since finishing second in her first career start.

<HEADLINE> Feds, Bell Atlantic Form Jobs Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Four years after it slashed its work force, Bell  
Atlantic Corp. is turning to the federal government to find more 
than 2,000 new employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic and the Labor Department announced an  
unprecedented partnership Thursday that is designed help the 
telecommunications giant fill jobs while reducing the government's 
unemployment rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	With the department's help, New York-based Bell Atlantic hopes  
to turn unskilled workers into telemarketers, operators, cable 
splicers and network technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been looking for innovative models and approaches to  
dealing with the skills shortage,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman 
told The Boston Globe. ``One of our biggest challenges is making 
sure workers have the skills to connect with jobs and employers 
have a way to connect with skilled workers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic said the partnership may turn into a long-term  
association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our industry, telecommunications, is one of the  
fastest-growing segments of the economy,'' said Ivan Seidenberg, 
chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic. ``We need all the 
skilled people we can find, but tens of thousands of 
telecommunications jobs are going unfilled in New York, Washington 
and Boston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In states where Bell Atlantic does business, unemployment  
offices will test and screen prospective employees. They then will 
be offered state or federal training. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting wages for full-time, entry-level jobs range from $319  
to $414 a week, plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Just over four years ago, Bell Atlantic offered a buyout package  
to reduce its payroll. About 8,000 workers took the offer. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the company has started to transform itself  
from a local telephone company to national firm involved in 
wireless and high-speed Internet services. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic is acquiring GTE for $55 billion and is forming a  
joint venture for nationwide wireless service with Vodafone 
AirTouch PLC. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic also is trying to become the first of the Baby  
Bells to offer long-distance telephone service.

<HEADLINE> Trainer Worries About Boxer Lewis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTRUN, Pa. (AP) -- Lennox Lewis is looking to knock out Evander  
Holyfield in their heavyweight championship rematch Nov. 13, and 
that worries Emanuel Steward, Lewis' trainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll throw a lot more punches, a lot more body shots and take  
a lot more chances,'' said Lewis, the WBC champion, who fought a 
majority draw against WBA-IBF champion Holyfield March 13 in a 
fight most ringsiders thought Lewis won clearly. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking more chances by a fighter known for his caution is what  
worries Steward. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox Lewis, the fighter, wants a knockout, not Emanuel  
Steward, the trainer,'' Steward said Thursday. ``In the first fight 
it was the other away around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many boxing observers thought Lewis could have knocked out  
Holyfield in the March fight at New York's Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``He realizes he should have knocked him out,'' said Steward,  
who wants fire, not recklessness, from the champion from Britain in 
the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lennox doesn't have to change his style, just his intensity,''  
Steward said before Lewis worked out for members of the media at 
Caesars Brookdale resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield said he had stomach cramps before and leg cramps  
during the March fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's about five different reasons when he loses,'' Lewis  
said. ``He's living in a fantasy world, and I'm going to wake him 
up to that fact.''

	Greenspan, in a speech at a Florida meeting of business  
executives late Thursday, said that a significant upturn in the 
growth of productivity in recent years has boosted the U.S. economy 
and kept inflationary pressures under control. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that the Fed's two interest rate hikes this summer  
are keeping the economy on a path of noninflationary growth.

	``This process of containment may already be significantly

	Dow Ends Up 109.23; New Nasdaq High  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a new high,  
leading a broad stock market rally that was extended today on 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's suggestion that the Fed's 
two interest rate hikes this year seem to be keeping inflation 
under control. The remarks raised hopes that there won't be another 
interest rate hike this year. Interest rates tumbled today on the 
inflation-sensitive government bond market. At the close of trading 
on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 107.33 at 
10,729.86, adding to its 227.64-point surge yesterday. Broader 
stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite index was 
up 91.30 at 2,966.52, well above the record close of 2,915.95 
reached on Oct. 11.

	New-Home Sales Fall in September  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New-home sales posted the biggest plunge in  
more than five years last month, dropping 12.8 percent as 
prospective buyers were put off by rising mortgage rates. The 
Commerce Department said the sales of new single-family homes fell 
to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units, much weaker 
than many analysts expected. It was the largest drop since January 
1994. Although rising mortgage rates were considered the major 
factor in the decline, the damage done in the eastern part of the 
country by Hurricane Floyd is seen as contributing to the downturn.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Akamai Technologies Inc. shares more than  
quintupled today in the fourth-hottest initial public offering 
ever, underscoring investor enthusiasm for a new Internet 
technology that speeds up delivery of Web pages to computer users. 
The red-hot investor reception bestowed yet another staggering 
valuation on a small, money-losing Internet company. Akamai closed 
at $145.18 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market after it was initially 
priced at $26 a share and opened at $110. Formed last year, Akamai, 
a Cambridge, Mass.-based company, offers Yahoo! and other Web 
destinations a service that delivers the most image-intensive 
portions of their Web pages -- such as advertisements with colorful 
moving images -- through a speedier route than the public Internet.

indicative of the company's real potential and I feel I must step 
up to being accountable for our disappointing financial outlook for 
2000,'' Teets said. Lockheed shares were down 4 1/16 to 18 7/8.

America, will add responsibility for Latin American operations and 
The Minute Maid Co. Doug Daft, who runs the Middle and Far East

	TOKYO (AP) -- Settlement of a U.S. lawsuit alleging a defect in

billion. But some analysts say the deal may also threaten its 
fledgling revival plan and possibly its brand image. The Japanese 
electronics manufacturer said it had reached a preliminary 
settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed in March by two U.S. 
users of Toshiba portable computers who said the floppy-disk drive 
controllers are faulty, distorting or losing information written 
onto disks. The company, which leads the U.S. laptop computer 
market, said that by settling, it did not admit legal liability or 
even acknowledge the possibility of a defect in its notebook

index jumped 3.5 percent, while the bank index climbed 2.8 percent. 
European technology shares rose after Intel and Microsoft led gains 
in the Nasdaq, while the whole financial sector was given a boost 
as inflation worries eased.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola Reorganizes Global Setup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The Coca-Cola Co. is putting responsibility for  
nearly all of its global operations in the hands of two senior vice 
presidents, who will report directly to chief executive M. Douglas 
Ivester. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Stahl, who already runs Coke's operations in North America,  
will add responsibility for Latin American operations and The 
Minute Maid Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Daft, who runs the Middle and Far East Group, gets added  
responsibility for the Africa Group and the company's new Schweppes 
Beverages Division. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very positive move for Coke,'' said John Sicher, editor  
and publisher of Beverage Digest, a soft-drink industry newsletter. 
``It focuses the top management structure under Ivester, and it 
makes accountability and reporting more efficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sicher called Stahl, 46, and Daft, 56, ``two of the company's  
real stars.'' Both men have proven track records and the respect of 
Coke bottlers around the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really shows that this company has the depth of management  
to move people around in a very positive way,'' Sicher said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senior vice presidents William Casey, Charles Frenette and Joe  
Gladden will continue to report to Ivester. Casey continues to head 
the Greater Europe Group. 
</P>
<P>
	Sicher said the changes put Stahl and Daft in the running to  
succeed the 52-year-old Ivester. Frenette and Chestnut are also 
possibilities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of economic problems in Asia and a recall in Europe  
earlier this year, Coca-Cola has seen a downturn in global sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Coca Cola reported an 11 percent drop in  
third-quarter net income, the fifth straight decline in Coke's 
quarterly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign markets, though, are starting to return to normal, said  
Coke spokesman Randy Donaldson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We could have made some of these changes earlier in the year,  
but in the midst of the economic problems that would have made it 
harder to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson said the realignment will not result in any firings or  
demotions. The existing managers in Latin America, Africa and the 
other divisions will keep their jobs but will report to Stahl and 
Daft. 
</P>
<P>
	James Chestnut also assumes new responsibilities, including  
corporate services, global communications, government relations, 
human resources and the office of corporate secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola shares rose 18 3/4 cents to $59 in trading at 5:15 p.m.  
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> 13-Year-Old Said Incapable of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- One of the youngest murder defendants in  
U.S. history -- a boy accused at age 11 of killing someone with a 
rifle from as far as 100 yards away -- went on trial Friday with his 
lawyer saying the slaying was an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger said in opening statements that Nathaniel  
Abraham, now 13, was shooting at trees with a ``piece of junk'' 
.22-caliber rifle that couldn't even be fired with any accuracy. He 
said the boy had ``a 6-year-old mentality'' when he shot 
18-year-old Ronnie Greene in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be zero evidence that he had any motive to kill  
Ronnie Greene,'' Fieger told the jury. ``He didn't even know Ronnie 
Greene. He didn't intend to kill anybody. He was a child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Lisa Halushka countered by saying that Nathaniel had  
told his girlfriend before the killing, ``I'm going to shoot 
somebody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Nathaniel Abraham did exactly what he said he was going to do  
and Ronnie Greene paid with his life,'' Ms. Halushka said. ``A 
clearer intent was never spoken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Nathaniel could get life in prison without parole,  
be held in a juvenile center until he turns 18, or receive a 
blended sentence in which he would be held until age 21 and then 
re-examined. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene was shot once in the head outside a Pontiac party store.  
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel is also on trial on charges of firing at neighbor  
Michael Hudack hours before Greene was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudack and Oakland County's medical examiner testified later  
Friday before proceedings were recessed until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Fieger said Greene was killed by a bullet that bounced off a  
tree. The rifle was defective, Fieger said, adding that even a 
marksman aiming at Greene would have missed him with that gun. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a piece of junk,'' Fieger said. ``It couldn't shoot  
straight if it had wanted to. This is a broken weapon. It can't be 
aimed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police have said Nathaniel was standing about 100 yards away  
when the shot was fired. But on Friday, prosecutors submitted to 
Fieger a report suggesting tests now show the shot was fired 
roughly 66 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
	Nathaniel's lawyers also have maintained that the boy, a slow  
learner, could not have understood his rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Hudack testified that he was home when he heard a noise  
resembling a firecracker. When he went outside, he said, something 
whizzed past his face. He said he looked to his left and spotted 
Nathaniel and another boy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nate was holding something in his hand. It appeared to be a  
gun,'' Hudack testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Under defense questioning, Hudack acknowledged he couldn't say  
with certainty who fired at him and that ``I don't know that 
(Nathaniel) was trying to shoot me or if he was shooting at the 
garage.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Troops Prepare To Depart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, East Timor (AP) -- Peacekeeping tanks and troops sealed off  
Dili's port Saturday as Indonesian forces prepared for what 
military sources said would be their final departure from East 
Timor later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indonesian garrison in the territory has already dwindled to  
only a few hundred troops. On Friday night they lowered the flag at 
their main barracks in a quiet ceremony and pulled out of the 
capital's telecommunications center. 
</P>
<P>
	A gray amphibious landing craft was anchored in the port with  
men and equipment being loaded aboard. Peackeeping troops kept a 
wary eye on a crowd of East Timorese who have been jeering and 
taunting the departing troops in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of the Indonesian troops had been considered  
imminent since a United Nations transition team formally took 
control of East Timor earlier this week. The U.N. is to oversee the 
transition to independence for the territory, likely to take two or 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, angry East Timorese gathered behind a fence  
surrounding the port to taunt Indonesian soldiers. Peacekeeping 
soldiers in full combat gear kept watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Although popular anger against the Indonesian military is high,  
the peacekeepers, the United Nations team and even the rebel army 
that battled them for years is trying to give the departing troops 
a respectful send-off. A simple farewell ceremony was expected to 
be held before the final contingent of high-ranking Indonesian 
military officials was to fly back to Jakarta later Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The departure of the Indonesian troops closes a chapter of  
history that resulted in the deaths of up to 200,000 East Timorese 
since the Indonesian invasion of the former Portuguese colony on 
Dec. 7, 1975. About 5,000 Indonesian troops died. 
</P>
<P>
	At its peak in the mid-1990s, the Indonesian force in East Timor  
numbered about 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia has effectively relinquished its claim to East Timor,  
which was left ravaged by a wave of violence surrounding its 
independence referendum on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The spree of burning, looting and terror by anti-independence  
militiamen drove nearly three-quarters of the province's 850,000 
people from their homes. About half of them are still displaced, 
and aid agencies have arrived in force to help feed and shelter 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a quarter-million East Timorese wound up in refugee  
camps in neighboring West Timor, controlled by Indonesia, but 
hundreds are arriving home daily. The latest refugee shop docked 
Saturday morning with nearly 1,400 East Timorese aboard, tying up 
only a few hundred yards from the last Indonesian ship waiting to 
sail for home. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-nation multinational peacekeeping force, led by  
Australia, arrived in East Timor on Sept. 20. Peacekeeping soldiers 
have now fanned out throughout the territory, though rogue 
paramilitary units still pose a threat along the tense border. 
</P>
<P>
	Attention is now turning to the territory's economic future. A  
delegation from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund 
arrived Friday to begin an assessment, expected to take three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation's head, Klaus Rohland, said that in addition to  
reconstruction loans, East Timor may receive donations of about $10 
million from the World Bank and up to $80 million from other donors 
to help the new country avoid being saddled immediately by debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The delegation has already met with Jose Alexandre ``Xanana''  
Gusmao, the former rebel leader widely expected to become the first 
president of an independent East Timor, probably in two or three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gusmao, who returned to East Timor after a tumultuous welcome a  
week ago, has also been meeting with peacekeepers and the United 
Nations transition team now running the territory. On Friday, a 
crowd turned out to greet Gusmao as he visited patients at Dili's 
main hospital.

<HEADLINE> Businesses Rail Against Calif. Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are searching for ways to weaken a  
California law that requires labels for all products with 
ingredients that pose potential health hazards because some 
business owners say the standards are too strict. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Strauss, president of Activa Products Inc. of Marshall,  
Texas, told a congressional hearing Thursday that the decorative 
sand he markets is technically called crystalline silica. That is 
one of 600 substances requiring a label warning about health risks 
for cancer or reproductive ailments under California's Proposition 
65. 
</P>
<P>
	Strauss said a Duke University toxicologist concluded the sand  
was a health threat only if used in a poorly ventilated room every 
day for 21 years. But the company is fighting a civil lawsuit 
threatening fines of $2,500 a day over the company's failure to 
carry a warning label in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``This sand essentially is no different than the sand you'd find  
at the beach, including beaches in California,'' he told the House 
Small Business Committee. ``The manner in which these bounty-hunter 
lawyers enforce Proposition 65 acts as a sledgehammer against small 
businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1986 California law lets private lawyers file a notice of  
intent to sue over alleged violations. If state authorities do not 
step in and take over within 60 days, the private attorneys can 
pursue the cases on their own. Such attorneys have obtained 
out-of-court settlements, and if successful in court, they are 
entitled to one-fourth of fines imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman James Talent, R-Mo., said he is considering  
ways to curtail such legal actions, saying he and other members of 
Congress are studying whether the state law could be pre-empted by 
a change in federal Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	By requiring labels for all products in California, the law  
reaches beyond the state's borders to any company producing 
something shipped to the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Defenders of the California law acknowledged some abuses by  
aggressive lawyers but said the law has yielded good results such 
as the removal of lead in plumbing fixtures and ceramic dishes, and 
trichloroethylene in typewriter-correction fluid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe consumers need to know this so they can protect  
themselves,'' said Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Weil, deputy attorney general in California, said the law  
filled gaps in regulatory networks and prodded federal action to 
protect consumers.

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Miller to 4-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Jamir Miller sees a time when the Cleveland  
Browns will be winners instead of winless. The Browns looked at 
Miller and saw the linebacker they want to anchor their defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was that Miller and the Browns agreed Friday to a  
four-year contract extension worth about $18.3 million, including 
$6 million in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 25, originally signed a one-year deal with Cleveland in  
May after five years with the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact means the expansion Browns can count on featuring  
Miller as they build their defense. While the unit has struggled as 
the team has gone 0-7, it also has kept the Browns in several games 
despite an offense averaging about seven points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has 69 tackles this season and has stood out as the  
team's defensive leader, although he will miss Sunday's game 
against New Orleans with a separated shoulder. He is hoping to 
return to the lineup for Cleveland's Nov. 7 game with Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Jamir signed with the Browns, it was an extension of  
faith on his part that he would take a shot on this new expansion 
organization,'' Browns president Carmen Policy said. ``This 
contract, Jamir, is intended to be a repayment of that trust you 
showed us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a first-round draft pick out of UCLA in 1994, came to  
Cleveland after turning down an offer from Arizona and attracting 
little interest on the free agent market, perhaps because of two 
previous violations of the league's substance abuse policy. He was 
suspended four games in 1995 after the second violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller bought a home for his family in Cleveland despite his  
one-year contract, figuring that if he flourished here, a long-term 
deal would follow. He was right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy that they decided to build the defense around  
me,'' Miller said, flashing a big smile. ``It's cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said he and his client weren't  
overly concerned with the new Browns' slow start because they were 
impressed with coach Chris Palmer, Policy and the rest of the 
Browns front office. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to look beyond the short-term. We feel they have the  
building blocks to be a winner for years to come,'' Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said that Miller's signing is a signal to the rest of the  
Browns players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good sign as to how the Cleveland Browns feel  
about those players that take care of this organization,'' Policy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential free agents may also note that Miller is confident  
enough in the Browns to stay with them, he added. Miller said he 
would be glad to make recruiting calls to free agents in the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why wouldn't I?'' he said. ``They take care of you here.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Aides Meet With Helms Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he wants to work  
out a deal with Sen. Jesse Helms on former Sen. Carol 
Moseley-Braun's nomination to be ambassador to New Zealand. ``If 
she gets a hearing, she would be confirmed,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he has instructed his staff to evaluate which  
documents to forward to Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee. White House staffers met Thursday with 
members of Helms' staff to start compiling a list of documents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we should at least take the request seriously, because  
I think if she gets a hearing, she would be confirmed,'' Clinton 
told reporters during an Oval Office ceremony on medical records 
privacy. ``I don't think it's right for one of our strongest 
allies, New Zealand, to be denied an ambassador ... because of a 
previous dispute with the chairman of the committee. ... I hope we 
can work it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If his committee receives the ``relevant documents,'' a hearing  
can be held as early as Tuesday, with a vote Wednesday, Helms said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms has said the one-term Illinois Democrat's nomination is  
under an ``ethical cloud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is nothing to hide in these documents, then there  
should be no reason for the White House to withhold them,'' Helms 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley-Braun, the nation's first black female senator, was  
defeated in a 1998 re-election bid. Civil rights groups and 
congressional Democrats have criticized Helms for seeking to block 
the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials on Wednesday pronounced Helms' request for  
Justice department and Internal Revenue Service documents 
``unreasonable.'' But on Thursday, they were taking a more 
conciliatory approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all the inflated rhetoric, the fact is that staff for  
the committee and the White House have already been meeting very 
amicably in an effort to narrow substantially the request for 
information,'' White House spokesman Barry Toiv said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope that can be accomplished soon and we will as quickly  
as we can provide the agreed-upon information,'' Toiv said. ``At 
that point, we will welcome a committee hearing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms was specific Thursday on exactly what his panel was  
looking for. Much of it involved allegations, never proven, that 
she used leftover funds from the 1992 campaign for personal 
luxuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee must be provided with key documents that shed  
light on why the Clinton Justice Department twice refused routine 
requests by the IRS Criminal Tax Division to have a grand jury 
investigate charges that Ms. Moseley-Braun diverted more than 
$200,000 in campaign funds for private use,'' Helms' statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said these included ``purchases of jewelry, luxury cars,  
designer clothes, stereo equipment and expensive personal vacations 
to Hawaii, Africa and Europe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The committee must also be provided with the documents that  
explain exactly who paid for her three expensive visits to Nigeria 
at the invitation of the late dictator Sani Abacha,'' Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
	Both allegations surfaced previously, most recently as part of  
Moseley-Braun's unsuccessful 1998 re-election bid against 
Republican Peter Fitzgerald.

<HEADLINE> Detroit School Girls Assaulted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- As many as eight girls have been sexually  
assaulted while walking to school in Detroit over the past two 
months, and police are stepping up patrols and warning youngsters 
to travel in groups. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a man wielding a nightstick attacked two sisters  
headed to Central High, raping the 16-year-old and robbing her 
15-year-old sister, police said. On Monday, a girl was attacked as 
she walked alone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had effective programs in places, but now with  
these reports surfacing, they've doubled, tripled their efforts,'' 
police spokeswoman Paula Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bridges said it is unclear whether the attacks are related.  
She said not all have been rapes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, three girls separately reported Thursday that men tried to  
abduct them on their way to school, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're finding is kids, they're cutting around corners,  
using vacant fields, using unsafe shortcuts,'' Ms. Bridges said. 
``All kids should be on heightened alert.'' She also said students 
should walk in groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The school system and the city are working to determine the  
safest routes for children to walk to school, and homeowners along 
those streets will be asked to keep their lights on and their eyes 
open.

<HEADLINE> Bardot Condems S.Korea Dog Eating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- French activist Brigitte Bardot  
condemns dog-eating in South Korea as savage. Some South Koreans 
wonder why she doesn't raise a ruckus about snails, a delicacy in 
France. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 middle-school students in Suwon, south of Seoul,  
recently sent protest letters to Ms. Bardot, lawmaker Kim Hong-shin 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would you like it if the Koreans call the French barbarians  
just because they eat snail?'' one wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim and several other lawmakers have introduced a bill to  
legalize the sale of dog meat. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has occasionally cracked down on dog-eating by  
invoking a law against consumption of ``unsightly'' foods. But many 
consider canine flesh, which is served mostly in soups and 
barbecues, to be a delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bardot, a former screen star and animal rights activist, has  
asked South Korea to forbid its citizens from eating dog meat 
during the 2002 World Cup soccer tournament to be played there and 
in Japan.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell sharply Friday against the  
Japanese yen, a day after rallying with stocks and bonds amid 
encouraging news on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 104.16  
Japanese yen, down nearly a yen from late Thursday's quote of 
105.04. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also retreated against other major currencies, with  
the euro rising to $1.0542, up from $1.0521 at the same point a day 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The downturn came despite a second day of big gains by stocks  
and bonds, which have been energized by reports showing that the 
U.S. economy's strength hasn't aggravated inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The big gains in the bond market, however, have produced a sharp  
cut in interest rates, making the dollar and dollar-denominated 
investments less appealing to foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currency trading Friday, the dollar was quoted at  
1.5220 Swiss francs, down from 1.5238 on Thursday, and 1.4713 
Canadian dollars, down from 1.4734. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the European countries participating in the euro  
are no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8549 
German marks, down from 1.8586 the prior day; 6.2211 French francs, 
down from 6.2336; and 1,836.37 Italian lire, down from 1,840.30.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Share Prices Rally / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo share prices rallied almost across the board  
Friday, bolstered by sharp overnight gains on Wall Street. The 
dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 528.37  
points, or 3.03 percent, to close at 17,942.08. On Thursday, the 
average closed up 31.35 points, or 0.18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 105.00 yen at midafternoon, up 0.94 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo but slightly below its late New York level 
of 105.04 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In stock trading, prices opened sharply higher after a jump on  
Wall Street overnight. Banking issues in particular rose during the 
morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 227.64  
points, or 2.2 percent, to 10,622.53 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reaction is so strong because players have been cautious  
and laying low for so long,'' said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager 
of the stock division at Chuo Securities. ``Worries about New York 
have been holding back an otherwise strong market,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 36.79 points, or 2.41 percent, to close at 
1,563.89. The TOPIX closed up 3.72 points, or 0.24 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, positive economic news out of the United  
States helped support the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department announced Thursday that gross domestic  
product in the third quarter rose by 4.8 percent, a little higher 
than expected, indicating the U.S. economy has proceeded to grow 
without significant inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Labor Department said that employment costs rose a  
slightly less-than-expected 0.8 percent in the July-September 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was, however, sold on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan, which traders interpreted as a warning 
that American economic growth cannot be sustained forever. 
</P>
<P>
	In prepared remarks to a group of top business executives in  
Florida, Greenspan said it is not wise to assume that the pace of 
productivity in the non-farm business sector of the U.S. gross 
domestic product can continue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 110.76 yen, up from  
109.14 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell  
to 1.8100 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.8550 percent. Its 
price rose 0.38 point to 99.91.

<HEADLINE> US Warns of Y2K Problems Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department has authorized the  
voluntary departure of eligible family members and nonessential 
employees from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova before Jan. 1 
because of potential Y2K-related disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was disclosed Friday in separate travel warnings  
issued for each country. The warning on Russia said the department 
is concerned about ``potential disruptions in energy supplies that 
may impact the health and safety of U.S. citizens residing or 
traveling in Russia, the duration of which is unknown,'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said U.S. citizens should consider deferring travel to Russia  
until the extent of Y2K-related disruptions becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Americans who would be eligible to depart Russia  
and the other countries was not disclosed. The announcement would 
affect nonessential employees at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and 
U.S. consulates in three Russian cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prolonged disruptions in energy supplies in Russia could put  
other systems dependent on electrical power at risk,'' the 
announcement said. ``In practical terms, this could mean disruption 
of basic human services such as heat, water, telephone and other 
vital services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar language was used in the warnings for Belarus and  
Moldova. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning on Ukraine said voluntary departure of eligible  
Americans was being authorized even though a U.S. government-funded 
study indicated a low risk of major disruptions to heat and 
electrical service in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the warnings said U.S. embassies and consulates abroad  
do not have facilities to provide private U.S. citizens overseas 
with food, water, fuel, medicines, shelter or other equipment in 
the event of disruption of essential services. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, the CIA informed Congress that it is ``highly  
confident'' Y2K computer failures will not lead to the accidental 
launch of a ballistic missile by any country. 
</P>
<P>
	But it expressed some concern over the safety of aging  
Soviet-era nuclear power plants in Russia and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Embassy spokesman Mikhail Shurgalin had no immediate  
comment on the U.S. announcement. Two weeks ago, Russian Deputy 
Security Chief Vladislav Sherstyuk said Russia will switch some 
crucial processes to manual control during the year 2000 changeover 
because it cannot afford to fix the Y2K bug on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Communications Committee, which is in charge of  
Russia's preparations for the changeover, earlier said Russia will 
also reduce the number of airplane flights on Dec. 31 and halt some 
hazardous industrial processes. 
</P>
<P>
	For some time, the State Department has been preparing warnings  
for Americans living or traveling in 194 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, it warned that in China there ``may be a risk of  
potential disruption in the key sectors of banking and finance, 
telecommunications, medical services and in electrical power and 
infrastructure systems outside of the coastal cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the prevailing view among senior embassy diplomats in China  
is that Y2K problems will be minimal in Beijing and other major 
Chinese cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more confident that things here won't fall apart than  
people in Washington,'' one diplomat said. He added that the 
embassy recommendation is not to authorize voluntary departures.

<HEADLINE> Spurrier Goes for 100th Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Steve Spurrier is looking for his 100th victory as Florida  
coach, and fittingly, it might come against rival Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 5 Florida (6-1, 4-1 SEC) and No. 10 Georgia (6-1, 4-1) face  
off Saturday with a Southeastern Conference title game berth likely 
on the line. The winner takes the lead in the SEC East. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 25 years before Spurrier became coach, Florida went 8-17  
in the rivalry. Eleven times in the history of the 95-year-old 
series, Georgia (6-1, 4-1) beat the Gators to knock them out of SEC 
title contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever since he got here, everyone has said, `You have to beat  
Georgia,''' offensive lineman Cheston Blackshear said. ``That has 
carried on over the years. People put pressure on him and he put 
pressure on himself to win that game. It's because they lost it so 
many times before he got here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida has defeated Georgia in eight of the last nine meetings,  
but that one loss was tough to take. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gators' 37-17 loss two seasons ago was Spurrier's first to  
Georgia as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``That hurt us a lot,'' receiver Darrell Jackson said. ``We were  
getting ready for the SEC title. That loss broke all our dreams and 
hurt our hearts. We knew we were the better team and we didn't play 
like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier was part of another heartbreaking loss to Georgia, in  
1966, his senior year as Florida's quarterback. The Gators blew a 
10-3 lead and lost 27-10. 
</P>
<P>
	``He talks about it,'' longtime sports information director Norm  
Carlson said. ``And the way he is, he remembers the whole game. He 
can tell you what happened in that game from beginning to end. He 
can tell you about the second half when Georgia ran the ball down 
our throats and kept it 20 minutes. He can tell you exactly how 
they did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurrier, 99-19-1 at Florida, said backup quarterback Jesse  
Palmer needs to be ready to replace Doug Johnson in case Johnson 
falters. Johnson and Spurrier have been at odds seemingly all 
season over the quarterback's decision-making skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to quit getting so upset at some things that  
happen,'' Spurrier said. ``And we've got to go back to coaching the 
way we've always coached since I've been here. That is, if one guy 
is struggling, you put another guy in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Georgia, a victory could put some of the doubts about  
Georgia's high ranking to rest. It would also give the Bulldogs 
something overwhelmingly positive to judge the season by -- a 
victory over their biggest rival. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another game, but it's a more special game this week,''  
Georgia tackle Jonas Jennings said. ``The mighty Gators have the 
big name. We need this game to be considered contenders in the SEC 
or for a big bowl. We all know that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game between Georgia and Florida is one of only two matchups  
pairing Top 25 teams against each another. The other features No. 
20 Southern Mississippi at No. 14 Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
	In other games Saturday, No. 1 Florida State is at Virginia, No.  
2 Penn State is at Illinois; No. 3 Virginia Tech at Pittsburgh, 
South Carolina at No. 4 Tennessee, Baylor at No. 6 Kansas State, 
North Carolina State at No. 7 Georgia Tech, No. 8 Nebraska at 
Kansas, No. 11 Wisconsin at Northwestern, No. 12 Texas at Iowa 
State, and Northern Illinois at No. 13 Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, No. 15 Michigan at Indiana, Air Force at No. 16 Brigham  
Young, No. 17 East Carolina at Houston, No. 18 Purdue at Minnesota, 
Iowa at No. 21 Ohio State, Oklahoma State at No. 22 Texas A&AMP;M, West 
Virginia at No. 23 Miami, No. 24 Oklahoma at Colorado, and No. 25 
Mississippi at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 9 Mississippi State and No. 19 Michigan State are idle.  
</P>
<P>
	Alabama is trying to rebound from a tough loss to Tennessee and  
might go into the game without its two best players. 
</P>
<P>
	Heisman hopeful running back Shaun Alexander and quarterback  
Andrew Zow each finished the game with sprained ankles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shaun and Andrew are better, but both are very doubtful at  
this point,'' Alabama coach Mike DuBose said. ``If things stay the 
way they are, they won't start Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (8-0) comes off a three-point victory over Clemson  
in which Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden won his 300th career game 
against his son, Tommy. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State can clinch at least a share of its eighth straight  
ACC title with a victory over Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seminoles have the ACC's top defense against the run and  
will try to stop 1,109-yard rusher Thomas Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen a better running back in college football than  
him,'' Bowden said.

<HEADLINE> Phone Cos. Brace for New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Major phone companies are sending an unusual  
New Year's plea to their customers: Don't pick up that phone! 
</P>
<P>
	They fear millions of people will check for a dial tone just  
after midnight on Jan. 1 to see whether their phone service 
survived the Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Add them to all the folks who ring in the New Year by calling  
family, and there's a potential for a telecommunications traffic 
jam. Some callers who pick up their handsets might hear nothing or 
get a fast busy signal. 
</P>
<P>
	But that won't necessarily indicate that Year 2000 problems have  
wrecked the network, say companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you pick up the telephone at or around midnight  
Dec. 31st and get a busy signal doesn't mean you've been bitten by 
the Y2K bug,'' said Bill Kula of GTE. Y2K problems arise from 
breakdowns in computer systems that read only the last two digits 
in a year and interpret 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The big phone companies say they've already solved their Year  
2000 computer problems, after spending more than $2.8 billion to 
upgrade their networks and supporting systems. Yet they are 
shelling out extra cash to urge consumers not to flood the system 
at midnight. They are using inserts in phone bills, grassroots 
information sessions and advertising to spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Federal Communications Commission says most small and  
midsize carriers expect to be compliant in time, some -- estimated 
to carry less than 1 percent of total phone access lines -- may not 
be. The FCC doesn't expect this to affect call processing and 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Lord, who wrote a book about the problem and publishes a  
bimonthly Y2K newsletter, cautions about the telecommunications 
industry: ``All of the information we have is based on 
self-reporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is also less certainty about international calls, since  
they could hinge on the Year 2000 readiness of foreign countries' 
infrastructures and domestic phone systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some folks will be disappointed because they will try  
to call other countries and some of those calls might not go 
through,'' said AT&AMP;T spokesman Dave Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone companies, bracing for congestion, are urging consumers  
not to pick up their phone just to see if the line is working and 
are hoping they will space out their calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't even test it,'' is the advice of Bell Atlantic spokesman  
Jim Smith. ``It's going to work. Don't make yourself nervous by 
running into a backed-up network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies anticipate some phone system blockages during  
the weekend -- particularly in the hours right after midnight and in 
the morning when people are calling relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates vary. But one high-end figure predicts the number of  
people picking up their phones then will be 11 times that of 
Mother's Day -- one of the year's busiest calling times, said Dave 
Bolger of the U.S. Telephone Association, which represents phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can clog the system even without dialing because just  
taking the phone off the hook engages the system. Once the system 
reaches a certain threshold, machines monitoring the traffic might 
start to block dial tones or send fast busy signals. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West has tried to calm customers' nerves with newspaper ads  
showing a sun rising over the trees and telling consumers that on 
Jan. 1, ``the phones will ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also set up a number that consumers can dial to  
simulate a call in the Year 2000: The call is placed through Y2K 
compliant equipment through systems with the date set one year 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way, consumers are not just relying on our corporate  
speak,'' said William White, the company's chief technology 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is that people might dial 911 to check the  
number, even if there's no emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE has ``encouraged our customers to think about the millennium  
and the use of the telephone as they would in a hurricane or 
earthquake,'' Kula said.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Saudis To Discuss Terror </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will  
take up her concerns about terrorism next week with a visiting 
Saudi delegation headed by the defense minister, Prince Sultan, her 
spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The session could provide an opportunity to probe how Saudi  
construction magnate Osama bin Laden finances what the State 
Department believes is a widespread terrorism network. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, whose citizenship was revoked by Saudi Arabia in  
1994, is in Afghanistan. The department contends he masterminded 
the bombing of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year and 
was involved in other terrorist incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always talk about counterterrorism cooperation,'' said  
department spokesman James P. Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	But he declined to say whether Albright would bring up a USA  
Today report Friday that five top Saudi businessmen had ordered the 
kingdom's biggest bank to transfer tens of millions of dollars to 
accounts for Islamic charities that serve as fronts for Bin Laden. 
The newspaper, citing as its sources unidentified U.S. intelligence 
officials, said the information was in a Saudi government audit 
acquired by U.S. intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no information on that detail,'' Rubin said. ``And  
frankly, the people that know a lot about this subject that I 
inquired with this morning didn't know much about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There may be less there than meets the eye,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The State Department, in an April report on terrorism, said bin  
Laden used inherited wealth and contributions from sympathizers in 
various countries. 
</P>
<P>
	As for news reports that bin Laden had offered to leave  
Afghanistan and had asked the Taliban -- which controls most of that 
country -- to help him reach a new location, Rubin said the United 
States had received no formal communication from the Taliban that 
bin Laden intends to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, Rubin said, ``Osama bin Laden can run from  
Afghanistan, but he cannot hide from our determination to pursue 
justice.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges Stockpiling for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan, one of the most technologically  
sophisticated nations in the world, is taking the Y2K computer 
problem seriously enough that it urged citizens Friday to stockpile 
water, food and fuel ahead of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances for problems are slim, the government said. But just in  
case, it suggested people stock up on two or three days worth of 
food and water, first-aid boxes, flashlights, radios and batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning is similar to those issued by a few other nations.  
Americans were advised by the Senate, Clinton administration Y2K 
panels as well as the Red Cross to prepare a three-day supply of 
water and food, fill up on gas and keep copies of bank statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K experts say the event should be treated like a storm, flood  
or other natural disaster, and that people should simply be 
similarly prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K glitch refers to the inability of some computers to  
recognize the difference between 1900 and 2000 because both end in 
double-0s. That could cause some computers to go haywire. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fear the millennium bug could halt trains and elevators,  
shut down water and electricity supplies, and even disrupt life 
support systems at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the Japanese government has kept relatively  
quiet about what it was doing to prepare. Public service ads have 
been virtually nonexistent, and many Japanese don't take the 
problem seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction worker Hajime Yoshida shrugged off the government  
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all just political talk that makes no sense,'' Yoshida  
said. ``There won't really be a problem in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many independent analysts say that Japan, among leading  
industrial nations, has lagged in its Y2K remedy efforts. The U.S. 
State Department, however, has said it considers the risks in Japan 
to be low. 
</P>
<P>
	International Monitoring, a Britain-based technology consulting  
company, says there is a low-to-moderate risk of serious 
disruptions in Japan because of year 2000-related failures. It 
predicts that the transport sector is most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government said it was prepared to deal with any  
problems, but nevertheless told people to set aside a few tanks of 
kerosene for home heaters and keep an eye out for mistakes in their 
bank statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important for every person to prepare for the small  
possibility of short-term inconveniences in everyday living,'' it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has not released any figures on what it has spent on  
fixing the bug. It also has not given a figure for the extra people 
the government expects to have on hand New Year's Eve to deal with 
any possible problems. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100,000 technicians from Japanese electronics companies  
plan to camp out in their offices from Dec. 31 to Jan. 4, just in 
case, according to the Japan Electronic Industry Development 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitoshi Sato, who owns a Tokyo pub equipped with its own power  
generator, said he planned to do little but withdraw a small amount 
of extra cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried one bit about all that computer stuff,'' he  
said. ``We can spend the New Year drinking beer.''

<HEADLINE> Chargers Extend Johnson's Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- San Diego Chargers defensive end Raylee Johnson  
has signed a five-year contract extension through 2004 that 
reportedly averages $3.1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can sleep a little easier at night now. I'm overwhelmed,''  
said Johnson, who's in the final year of a three-year contract he 
signed before the 1997 season. That deal, which included a $1.7 
million signing bonus, averages $1.5 million a season. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, a seventh-year pro, moved into the starting lineup this  
season. His 2 1/2 sacks rank him second on the team behind All-Pro 
linebacker Junior Seau.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Sprewell Accepts Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell has decided to accept  
the New York Knicks' offer of a five-year, $61.9 million contract 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, also offered a two-year, $21 million deal, made the  
announcement before the Knicks' 106-103 loss to the New Jersey Nets 
on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Wednesday, he was believed to have been leaning  
towards the shorter contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy with the numbers in the five-year deal,'' Sprewell  
said. ``I feel more secure with that. That's what I feel more 
comfortable with. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I had taken the two-year, I would have been  
wondering if it was the right thing. In the back of my mind I would 
have been thinking, `Let's stay healthy.' I just want to go out and 
play and not worry about being healthy because my contract is up in 
a couple of years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 29-year-old Sprewell will earn $9 million this season, the  
final year of the four-year deal he signed with Golden State three 
years ago. His new contract, which includes an opt-out clause after 
four years, will kick in next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell was expected to sign the new deal as early as today.

<HEADLINE> Shifts Since Microsoft Trial Began </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the year since the antitrust trial opened  
against Microsoft Corp., the nation's high-tech industry has made 
some of its most dramatic shifts since consumers began discovering 
the Internet in droves. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Netscape Communications Corp., whose pioneer browser  
software helped popularize the Web, has a powerful new owner in 
America Online Inc., plus another strong new ally whose chief 
executive is no friend to Bill Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	A few of the nation's largest computer makers are selling some  
machines without Microsoft's Windows software already installed. 
Consumers previously tied to bulky desktop computers can surf the 
Internet using handheld devices, even fancy cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	It's enough to raise the question: Can the slow wheels of  
justice keep pace in ``Internet time,'' where four years is roughly 
the equivalent of a generation? 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson could announce his  
factual findings in the Microsoft trial as early as Friday, the 
first step toward a final verdict. That decision also was expected 
to serve as a barometer for whether the judge believes the company 
broke antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	But legal experts expect the landmark case to wind through  
appeals courts for as long as two years. That kind of delay would 
complicate decisions about possible punishments against Microsoft 
that might still be applied in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you write a prescription that the patient is ultimately  
going to take 24 months later in an industry that moves this 
fast?'' said William Kovacic, an antitrust expert at George 
Washington University. ``It's a terrible problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are cutting new ground here,'' agreed Rob Enderle, an  
industry analyst with Giga Information Group. ``Whatever (the 
judge) does will set a precedent that will be followed and cursed 
or blessed for decades to come. This is likely to be his biggest 
moment in history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gates declined to answer questions about the antitrust case  
during an appearance today in Florida. He spoke to a group of 
former chief executives about how the Internet likely will affect 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Gates also didn't discuss the courtroom fight during a speech  
Thursday in New York. He talked instead about children growing up 
already embracing the Internet, an era he called ``Generation I, I 
for Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate appearance also in New York on Thursday, Assistant  
U.S. Attorney General Joel Klein said the fast pace of the 
Microsoft trial ``demonstrates that both the Department of Justice 
and the court system can move in Internet time.'' Other important 
government antitrust actions, such as a lawsuit against IBM, 
dragged on for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Klein also dismissed talk about possible remedies as premature,  
saying it would be ``putting the cart before the horse.'' People 
close to the case said the government still is deciding what type 
of punishment yet to recommend against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's lawyers have forcefully argued these dramatic shifts  
in the industry undermine allegations that competition among 
high-tech companies is so inadequate that a judge's intervention is 
required. 
</P>
<P>
	They used AOL's recent $10 billion purchase of Netscape to  
dispute the government's allegation that it illegally wielded its 
influence to crush rivals, including Netscape. They cited e-mail 
from AOL chief executive Steve Case figuring that if AOL began 
distributing Netscape's browser to its 19 million subscribers, its 
portion would climb to ``more than two-thirds share again!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft also has noted that some major computer makers now  
offer models running Linux software, suggesting the company's 
reputed stranglehold isn't as tight over the industry as portrayed 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice lawyers reject those arguments, citing figures showing  
that Microsoft Windows continues to run the vast majority of the 
world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	They also cite evidence from the trial that even the largest  
computer companies expressed fear at upsetting Microsoft. Compaq 
Computer Corp. once wondered in an internal presentation about the 
software giant, ``How retaliatory could they get?''

<HEADLINE> Spook Hill in Fla. Draws Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE WALES, Fla. (AP) -- Jane Henderson shifts the Ford Aerostar  
into neutral and waits. Slowly, the minivan starts to roll backward 
-- a couple hundred feet uphill. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really spooky,'' she says, her mother seated beside her.  
They are visiting Spook Hill in the humble farming town of Lake 
Wales, two among thousands who visit annually. Like many, Ms. 
Henderson leaves guessing: ``I don't know if it's an optical 
illusion or really real.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or is it geology? Or ghosts? Or both?  
</P>
<P>
	Folklore and legend offer more questions than answers. One story  
is that riders carrying mail between the Florida coasts found their 
horses breathless on the downhill swing. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. Lake Wales, a town of 11,000 and one of the few  
places in Florida that even has hills, is on the tourists' maps. 
Drivers now follow a one-way road, dutifully stopping at a white 
line city officials painted on the pavement years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a banner touting S-P-O-O-K H-I-L-L, they put vehicles in  
neutral, hold their collective breath and appear to roll slowly up 
an incline. 
</P>
<P>
	Plenty of visitors have already placed a carpenter's level near  
the hill's halfway point and found an upward slope that cars 
apparently follow. But there are skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an illusion that it's uphill, when in fact you're going  
downhill,'' insists Jim Palmer, a doctoral student in geology at 
the University of South Florida in Tampa. Just because we're in 
Florida, he notes, ``the laws of physics are not suspended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Ed Ethington, director of the Chamber of Commerce, prefers  
that pondering not go too deep. Just stop by, he suggests, with the 
emphasis on stop. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Ethington has no exact figures, visitors lay down plenty  
of cash at restaurants, hotels and a 157-acre botanical garden 
nearby. And for such special events as this weekend's ``Bikefest 
Spooktakular,'' which, he says, could draw at least 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	When they leave, they'll carry the mystery beyond even Tampa, 60  
miles west. Residents know the reverberations. ``When we go way out 
of the area or even in foreign countries people say, 'Oh that's 
where Spook Hill is,''' says Ethington. 
</P>
<P>
	And guests arrive at G.V. Tillman House B&AMP;B aware of the hill,  
confirms Kathy Dowling, who owns the inn with husband Jim. ``They 
either try to analyze it and figure it out, or they just think it's 
cute,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	The town polishes the image. In the late 1950s, a principal at  
Spook Hill Elementary School asked for -- and received -- permission 
from Harvey Comics to use a logo. Ever since, youngsters have 
embraced Casper the Friendly Ghost as their mascot. Now tourists 
come right to the school's door to buy T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Friday before Halloween, students celebrate Casper's  
birthday with a festival that includes a parade, carnival and hunt 
for treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Roberts, a secretary at the school, came to Lake Wales  
as a 13-year-old Air Force brat. Now 30, she recites the legends 
about Spook Hill like ABCs: 
</P>
<P>
	This is haunted land of a fight between an Indian chief  
Cufcowellax and a huge bull 'gator -- a struggle so intense that it 
turned the lake red with blood. It's where explorer Ponce de Leon 
still searches for the Fountain of Youth. Or pirates even now 
divert attention from buried treasure. 
</P>
<P>
	You may even find the elderly gentleman who named the hill.  
Years ago, he parked his car at the foot of the hill, intent on 
fishing in nearby North Lake Wales. He glanced back, so they say, 
to see his jalopy, its motor off, slowly backing up the hill. Then, 
he muttered ``spooks'' -- and fell dead. 
</P>
<P>
	This all makes sense to Roberts and her three children. ``It's  
more fun that way,'' she says.

<HEADLINE> Violent 'Plot' Closes Ohio School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Four white students were arrested and seven  
others questioned in what was described as a racially motivated 
plot to carry out a Columbine-style massacre at their predominantly 
black high school Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White closed South High for the day after the  
parents of a student tipped off authorities. White said that police 
seized two guns from one student's house, and that the group 
planned to get weapons from a gang. No guns or explosives were 
found at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was more than cafeteria banter,'' the mayor said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the students questioned, Sarah Jedd, 15, said the four  
who were arrested, all boys, had maps of South High with positions 
for each shooter. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they were going to break into people's houses,  
stores, whatever it took for them to get the supplies they 
needed,'' she said. ``They thought it was cool, that someone could 
open fire on a school. They thought it was amusing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a possible motive for the violence, the mayor said  
police believe race was a factor. He said the students felt 
alienated, but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	White also would not give details of the alleged plot or confirm  
a report by The Plain Dealer that the students told police they 
planned to use guns and homemade explosives to kill teachers, 
administrators and fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Shields, an attorney for two of the students questioned,  
said one of them had a map of the school only because he was new to 
South High and was getting in trouble for being late to class. 
``And that's what is now being turned into this map and this plot 
thing,'' he told CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer reported that the massacre was planned for just  
before noon, when students would open fire in the cafeteria and the 
principal's office. The students also planned a suicidal shootout 
with police in a school courtyard, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those details were reminiscent of the worst school shooting in  
U.S. history, the April 20 massacre at Columbine High in Littleton, 
Colo. Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, scattered gunfire and 
bombs, killing 13 and wounding at least 23 before killing 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said they did not know why the students chose Friday  
for the attack, but noted that it was the day of the school's 
homecoming. The dance and football game were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	The four students arrested were charged with inciting violence,  
false alarm, aggravated menacing, ethnic intimidation and inducing 
panic. If convicted, they could be imprisoned until they are 21. 
Their names and ages were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Bailey, who joined other parents and students outside the  
school Friday morning, said police arrested his 14-year-old son, 
Adam, and searched the teen-ager's room, taking a computer and some 
disks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said his son had never been in trouble but ``hung out  
with the wrong crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 11 students allegedly involved were suspended for 10 days.  
</P>
<P>
	Miss Jedd said her name was on the maps, and she knew about the  
plot for three weeks. It was unclear whose parents told police of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Byrd-Bennett, chief of the 77,000-student school  
district, said classes would resume at South on Monday with 
heightened security. She said police officers would be in the 
school and scan students with hand-held metal detectors. The school 
has 1,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Those assurances did not calm the fears of Richard Talbott,  
whose daughter, Takila, is a junior at South. He said he probably 
would not let her return to school on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they can say anything right now to make me feel  
safe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Columbine, authorities around the country have charged  
students with planning or threatening to carry out similar acts. 
The National Safety Center estimated at least 3,000 copycat bomb 
threats were made in the weeks after Columbine -- about five times 
the usual number. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, for example, Monmouth Regional High School in Tinton  
Falls, N.J., was closed because someone scrawled on a bathroom 
wall: ``The Trench Coat Mafia is here. Everyone is going to die the 
29th'' -- a reference to a group Klebold and Harris were associated 
with. 
</P>
<P>
	The school was searched and will reopen Monday, but police had  
not found the culprit.

<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Before beginning his eulogy for Payne  
Stewart today, Paul Azinger donned a tam o'shanter cap and rolled 
up his trousers to reveal a pair of argyle socks -- an outfit 
similar to his close friend's trademark look.

two-hour, gripping memorial service today at First Baptist Church 
attended by some 3,000 people, including friends, family and golf 
fans.

<P>
	Stewart, the two-time U.S. Open champion, was among six people  
killed Monday when his Learjet soared uncontrolled until running 
out of fuel and crashing into a field in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old Stewart was eulogized as a buoyant and gracious  
man with a passion for his family, his faith and for the game he 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart loved life,'' Azinger said. ``He was the life of  
every party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger joked that only Stewart could get him to wear a suit.

	Azinger broke into tears as he said, ``Goodbye, Payne. We loved  
you and we miss you, but we know we will see you again.'' 


</P>
<P>
	Stewart's widow, Tracey, spoke of how she fell for him when she  
met him. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the night of our first date, I can honestly tell you this  
is the man I wanted to share the rest of my life with,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of his devotion to their son and daughter, actively  
involved in their budding interest in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will always be my soulmate and my best friend. We love  
you. Let the party in heaven begin,'' she concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour had canceled play at the Tour Championship and the  
Southern Farm Bureau Classic so players could attend the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that we're taking the day off so we can go to the  
service,'' said Hal Sutton, the defending champion at the Tour 
Championship in Houston. ``He deserves his day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 29 players in the Tour Championship already experienced  
the powerful emotions of paying tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first round began Thursday in Houston, players  
attended a brief but somber service on the first tee of Champions 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing 27 holes, many of them boarded private planes for  
a one-day trip to Orlando to say goodbye to Stewart one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very, very emotional for a lot of people,''  
said Davis Love III, whose father was killed in a plane crash 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Love and Tom Lehman were among those who thought about taking  
the entire week off until deciding it was best to be with their 
peers to start the grieving. After getting through a difficult day 
of golf in which the focus was far from birdies and bogeys, they 
will return to Houston on Saturday for another 27 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility exists that some will be so shook up, they will  
not want to return to Houston to resume the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see what the weekend brings,'' Love said. ``It's good  
for me to have a day off, but I don't know. You have to take each 
guy individually and see what they shot and how close they were to 
Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the European PGA Tour, players planned to pause for a moment  
of silence on the 18th green following today's round at the Volvo 
Masters in Jerez, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's impact on golf went far beyond his 18 victories around  
the world, including two U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. He was 
a member of five Ryder Cup teams and showed a passion for the 
matches like few others. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem recalled one of the last  
conversations he had with Stewart, right after the United States 
stormed from behind to win the Ryder Cup in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he had eight years left on the PGA Tour and then was  
going to play a full Senior Tour schedule,'' Finchem said. ``He was 
fully together and understood exactly where he was. He was in a 
crystal ball and could see where he was going. And I was delighted 
to know those knickers were going to be out here for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clothes were but a small part of the Stewart legacy.  
</P>
<P>
	He had the kind of flamboyant personality to wear the  
traditional golf garb -- the knickers and tam o'shanter cap often 
wore by Ben Hogan. At times, Stewart would wear a tie during 
pro-ams, which is what Walter Hagen and other great players in the 
early 20th century wore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was meticulous in the way he presented himself as a PGA  
Tour player,'' Finchem said. ``He felt so strongly about the 
importance to the presentation of our sport. He is in many ways 
irreplaceable from that perspective. He was a unique figure in 
sports and in golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For style alone, Finchem compared him to Hagen, ``a player who  
had this bigness, this presence about him, who dressed for the 
game, who brought excitement to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a substance to Stewart, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	He was perhaps the most successful player in the U.S. Open, the  
toughest championship in golf, during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won his first U.S. Open in 1991, beating Scott Simpson  
in an 18-hole playoff at Hazeltine in Minnesota. He also won in 
June at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, one of the most dramatic 
finishes in the 105-year history of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He had two other close calls in the U.S. Open, losing by two  
strokes to Lee Janzen at Baltusrol in 1993 and again finishing 
second to Janzen at The Olympic Club in San Francisco a year ago, 
when he failed to hold a 4-stroke lead going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry about me, boys,'' Stewart said at the time. ``I'll  
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept his word.

<HEADLINE> Three Mariners Coaches Let Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Three Seattle Mariners' coaches won't be brought  
back next year following a disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitting coach Jesse Barfield, third-base coach Steve Smith and  
pitching coach Stan Williams will not return, the team said Friday. 
Mariners spokesman Tim Hevly said their contracts expired and will 
not be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, first base coach Sam Mejias retired after the 1999 season.  
Seattle finished third in the AL West at 79-83. 
</P>
<P>
	Barfield had been the Mariners' hitting coach for two seasons.  
Williams was appointed pitching coach last season, and Smith spent 
four years as a major league coach in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has been offered another job in the Mariners minor league  
system, where he worked for five years previously. 
</P>
<P>
	The team also announced it plans to keep John McLaren, who has  
been with the Mariners for eight years and was bench coach last 
season, and Matt Sinatro, Seattle's bullpen coach for the past five 
years. The Mariners have not yet determined which coaching spots 
McLaren and Sinatro will fill next season.

<HEADLINE>  Stewart Remembered in Mississippi  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Payne Stewart the man, not the U.S. Open  
champion, was remembered by PGA Tour players Andy Bean and Bradley 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take away all of Payne's victories, take away all of his money  
and all of his awards and I would be a proud and happy father if my 
sons grew up to be the way Payne Stewart was,'' said Bryant, whose 
sons are 6 and 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours after completing their rounds at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic on Thursday, Bean and Bryant spoke during a memorial 
service for Stewart, the U.S. Open champion who along with five 
others was killed in a plane accident on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant also passed along a message from Stewart's wife, Tracey,  
who said her husband would have been proud of the tremendous 
outpouring of support given to her and their two children in the 
wake of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The support we are giving her now is good, but it has to go  
on,'' Bryant told fellow golfers. ``Tracey, Aaron and Chelsea, out 
of our love, out of our respect and out of our friendship we have 
for Payne, let's be there for his family, not just tomorrow but for 
the months and years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bean's friendship with Stewart dated back to 1982. He said he  
had seen many changes in Stewart in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last five or six years, I grew to respect Payne more  
and more. Not only had he matured as a golfer, but as a man,'' Bean 
said. ``He was a better husband and a better father. Golf was a job 
now, not the most important thing in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could only have been possible because Payne came to know  
Jesus Christ and trusted him. The last two or three years of his 
life, anyone would have been proud to walk in those shoes. Not to 
the tournaments he was in or the tournaments he won, but because he 
matured more than he ever had before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 players and caddies were among those who took part in  
the memorial service at Colonial Heights Baptist Church in Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the players at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic,  
including first-round leader Russ Cochran, were not there because 
they had already flown to Florida for a memorial service there 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Tour Championship in Houston, play at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic has been suspended until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant, a 22-year-old Tour veteran who is retiring from  
competitive golf after this week, is a stroke off the lead at the 
Southern Farm Bureau after his opening-round 7-under-par 65 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When he later took the podium at the church with images of his  
friend on a screen above him, golf seemed trivial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Payne is with Jesus tonight because I know Payne put  
his trust in Jesus, not in himself and not in anything else,'' 
Bryant said. ``I plan to see Payne again. I'm going to Heaven, I've 
trusted God, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passing along a message from fellow PGA Tour player Paul  
Azinger, Bryant said no one has lost Stewart, even though he died 
in a tragic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be lost when you know where you are at, and all your  
friends know where you are at,'' Bryant said.

<HEADLINE> Clayson: Rising With Bryant Gumbel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bryant Gumbel you know. Former ``Today Show''  
anchor. Smooth, smart. Spiffy dresser. Loves to play golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Remember? Of course, you do!  
</P>
<P>
	But this is a story about the not-yet-so-recognized Jane  
Clayson, a slender, pretty young woman who, starting Monday 
morning, will share the anchor desk with Gumbel on CBS' brand-new 
``Early Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Airing weekdays from 7 to 9 a.m. EST, ``The Early Show'' will  
vie with ABC's ratings also-ran ``Good Morning America'' and NBC's 
``Today,'' the five-years-running champ. And as sign-on nears, 
Clayson, along with Gumbel and seemingly every other available hand 
at CBS, has been spreading the word: ``The Early Show'' is coming! 
</P>
<P>
	To that end, Clayson has received a reporter in her interim  
office at CBS News' West 57th Street headquarters. Looking relaxed 
after hours (and days!) of similar interrogation, she gamely 
responds to his questions, most of which call for divine prophesy: 
``What kind of inroads will you make against `Today'? How will you 
deal with celebrity? Will Bryant steal the show?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, it goes without saying that none of this conjecture  
will matter once Monday arrives. Thereafter, ``The Early Show'' 
either will or it won't. Whatever. 
</P>
<P>
	Same for Clayson.  
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity is extraordinary and I'm up for it,'' she  
declares. ``But I am who I am, and that's what the show will get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What the show will get is a 32-year-old native of Sacramento,  
Calif., who attended Brigham Young University on a music 
scholarship (she still enjoys playing violin), then caught the 
journalism bug. She worked as a reporter and anchor at a Salt Lake 
City TV station. In 1996, she joined ABC News as a Los 
Angeles-based correspondent. 
</P>
<P>
	She says she was happy at ABC, so when invited to discuss the  
``Early Show'' job with its executive producer Steve Friedman and 
CBS News president Andrew Heyward last spring, she went in with 
``zero expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `Gosh, this is just an opportunity to meet a couple  
of big-name network guys.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Next she met with another big-name network guy, Gumbel, who,  
after two years at CBS and a failed prime-time magazine, had agreed 
to return to morning television. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found him a very warm, funny, witty, generous guy,'' says  
Clayson, despite sporadic reports to the contrary (only the day 
before, a magazine article on Gumbel described a not-so-warm 
relationship with his longtime ``Today'' co-anchor Katie Couric). 
``I think my first instincts about him were right on. The last few 
weeks have confirmed them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last few weeks have been hectic for Clayson, whose hiring  
was announced only in September. She had just returned from a 
Cayman Islands vacation with her parents and grandparents. Since 
then, she has not only plunged into preparations for ``The Early 
Show'' but also in making a new home in Manhattan. (To keep the 
move from California as simple as possible, she brought only the 
basics -- including her piano.) 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel ready,'' she says. ``Do I need to grow some more? Of  
course. Am I now what I will be in six months or a year? No. This 
will take time.'' Both for her, she readily acknowledges, and for 
``The Early Show'': ``No one is suggesting that we go out there and 
work miracles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, the network's near-term goal is to score a few points in  
a game it has been playing, and bollixing, for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Its umpteenth attempt, ``This Morning,'' vanishes today without  
a trace. But the show boldly dawning Monday will have far more 
going for it than the ones that went before. 
</P>
<P>
	There's the $30 million, glassed-in ``Early Show'' studio right  
across Fifth Avenue from Central Park (and eight blocks removed 
from the West 57th site of past humiliations). There's the big-name 
anchor boasting 15 years at ``Today'' (Gumbel -- remember?). 
</P>
<P>
	There's the similarly proven talent running the show -- Friedman,  
who as ``Today'' executive producer masterminded the windowed 
studio in Rockefeller Center that made plate glass a morning-show 
must. 
</P>
<P>
	But most intriguingly, there's Clayson, the secret ingredient,  
the X Factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the newcomer,'' she says, ``but I think that they welcome  
it, and I'm certainly no pushover. I have ideas and I have 
experience and I think they want that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the major unknown in an otherwise pre-tested mix, it is  
Clayson who could lift ``The Early Show'' beyond the solid effort 
it is likely, at bare minimum, to be. Her presence might yield a 
sort of ``Early Show'' je ne sais quoi, tipping the scales toward 
breakout success. 
</P>
<P>
	Or not.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who knows?'' says Clayson, brushing aside proposed scenarios,  
both good and ill. ``But you gotta be optimistic and remember 
what's important: to be like my friend Bryant Gumbel, coming in 
prepared for what you need to do that day, and doing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you know what? That's the way I work.''  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hakkinen Leads Formula One Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUZUKA, Japan (AP) -- Defending Formula One champion Mika  
Hakkinen of McLaren was the fastest, while chief rival Eddie Irvine 
of Ferrari slumped to 10th in a practice session Friday for the 
season-ending Japanese Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	David Coulthard, McLaren's other driver, crashed after clocking  
the second-fastest lap time of 1 minute, 41.894 seconds, behind 
Hakkinen's 1:41.746. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferrari fared well after all. Irvine's teammate, Michael  
Schumacher, finished the two-hour session over the 3.643-mile 
Suzuka circuit with the third-fastest time of 1.42.215. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a fair amount of damage to the car,'' said Coulthard,  
who escaped injury when he lost control on a curve, skidded off the 
track and spun backwards into the tire barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulthard said his car shed its rear wing and left front wheel,  
and was being stripped down for an overnight rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I know that the team will work hard to fix it before  
tomorrow, so I am looking forward to a competitive qualifying 
session.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine, who goes into Sunday's showdown race with 70 points,  
four points ahead of Hakkinen, had an unimpressive time of 
1:43.375. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think things are as bad as they look from my lap time  
today,'' Irvine said. ``My main concern was a lack of grip. In this 
situation it is always difficult to balance the car and I suffered 
with mid-corner understeer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow with a different setup and fresh tires, I'm sure I  
can do better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen said the two one-hour sessions went well. ``We worked  
through our race program to find a good setup and seem to have 
found a reasonable balance. That said, you can always go quicker 
and we will be looking to do that tomorrow in qualifying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher felt the track was very slippery and offered less  
grip than at the last race a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Towards the end of the afternoon session, we found a good  
setup, which is not reflected in the times, as the tires were old 
by then,'' the two-time world champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is still room for improvement, so I am confident we can  
fight for the pole tomorrow and a victory on Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The key to the drivers' title for both Hakkinen and Irvine is  
strong efforts by teammates Coulthard and Schumacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Schumacher, making a surprising return in Malaysia two weeks ago  
after seven races on the sidelines with a broken leg, played a big 
role in helping Irvine win that race. 
</P>
<P>
	After seizing the lead, Schumacher held up Hakkinen lap after  
lap and twice moved over for his teammate to surge ahead during the 
56-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
	Irvine said his problems Friday were the result of a heavy fuel  
load in his Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
	Hakkinen has to win the season finale to retain the title he won  
at the same track last year. 
</P>
<P>
	If Irvine wins, he will be Ferrari's first champion in 20 years.

<HEADLINE> US Warned on Israel, Algeria Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department issued travel advisories  
Friday for Americans visiting Israel and contemplating visiting 
Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
	It said Americans should be careful traveling in Bethlehem and  
Ramallah on the West Bank. Periodic tensions and an ongoing 
potential for violent clashes especially in the vicinity of 
Rachel's tomb were cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans also were cautioned to think twice before traveling to  
Algeria. Terrorist incidents are on the decline, but unpredictable 
attacks continue in crowded urban areas and rural villages, along 
roadsides and on public transportation, the department said.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Aims To Avoid Negativity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) -- Facing more aggressive rhetoric from  
Vice President Al Gore, Democratic presidential hopeful Bill 
Bradley said Friday that some politicians believe ``you're toast'' 
if you don't go negative. ``I haven't reach that point,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to lay out a positive vision of the country, not  
demean an opponent,'' Bradley said in a speech to magazine 
executives. ``I think people would rather get to Election Day and 
have two people that they esteem as opposed to one person they can 
barely tolerate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The speech came a day after Gore stepped up his attacks on  
Bradley's health care proposals as being too expensive. At a 
campaign stop in Iowa, Gore said both Bradley's campaign and that 
of Republican front-runner George W. Bush have ``serious problems 
with fiscal responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Bradley was emphasizing the need to stay positive, his  
campaign issued a point-by-point list of Gore's ``promises without 
pricetags.'' Among them: public financing of elections, licensing 
of handgun purchases and tax credits for companies that help clean 
up the environment, and for families who provide long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley aides also tried to blow a hole through Gore's latest  
weapon: An Emory University study by former Clinton administration 
official Kenneth Thorpe projecting a budget-busting $1.2 trillion, 
10-year cost for Bradley's health plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore trumpeted the report as ``nonpartisan'' during Wednesday's  
debate with Bradley. On Friday, Bradley's campaign countered by 
distributing copies of an Oct. 4 university Press release boasting 
that Thorpe, ``in his first weeks at Emory ... has advised Vice 
President Al Gore on health insurance issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing relaxed in his appearance at this Florida resort,  
Bradley peppered his speech with folksy anecdotes about his parents 
and a recent fund-raiser in Chicago, where he recruited several 
retired basketball stars. He also touched on campaign finance 
reform, nuclear disarmament and health care policy. 
</P>
<P>
	But the overriding theme of his speech was maintaining a civil  
tone during the campaign. Bradley said he hoped to ``lay the 
premise here that we can have a new kind of politics, and take a 
certain amount of blows and moreover test the hypothesis that 
people want that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The rough rule of thumb among political consultants is that  
negative campaigning works, and therefore if you don't do it, 
you're toast,'' he said. ``I haven't reached that point. Yet at the 
same time, I know from basketball that you can only take elbows for 
so long before you have to give them back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also touched on other themes of his campaign, including  
getting more children out of poverty, breaking down barriers 
between racial groups and protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley said the wealthiest 40 percent of Americans have  
benefitted most from the economic boom of the past decade, and that 
much of the middle class has felt left out. ``The middle class is 
saying, 'I want to get on that prosperity train.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in Miami, Bradley said he would not lift economic  
sanctions against Cuba, citing human rights violations by Fidel 
Castro's government. The embargo, which dates to 1962 and bans U.S. 
firms from doing business in Cuba in an attempt to weaken the 
government, has strong support among south Florida's Cuban-American 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley called it ``an important part of the way to put pressure  
on Castro.''

	Mary Mapes was subpoenaed last week and ordered to turn over a  
transcript and outtakes from newsman Dan Rather's interview that 
aired Sept. 28 on ``60 Minutes II.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State District Judge Joe Bob Golden told the Dallas-based  
producer to meet a 3 p.m. CDT deadline to produce the transcript or 
report to Jasper County Jail. He denied a motion by Ms. Mapes' 
attorney, Charles Babcock, to delay the order while he seeks an 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Babcock said he would proceed with the appeal, regardless.  
</P>
<P>
	Golden also ordered a Tuesday hearing to rule on whether Ms.  
Mapes must turn over the raw footage. 
</P>
<P>
	Berry is the third and final white capital murder defendant to  
go on trial in the dragging death of a black East Texas man. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say they wants to compare Berry's statements in the  
outtakes to others he gave during the investigation into the June 
7, 1998, death of James Byrd Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mapes ``is clearly a witness to statements made by Shawn  
Berry out of court, and they are admissible against him,'' said 
Brit Featherston, an assistant U.S. attorney working with Jasper 
County prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the CBS interview, Berry said he tried to stop the attack on  
Byrd, but backed off when one of his alleged accomplices, John 
William King, threatened him. King and Lawrence Russell Brewer, 
white supremacists who became buddies in prison, were convicted and 
sentenced to death earlier this year in separate trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mapes told the judge the transcripts were at her house,  
about 200 miles northwest of Jasper. She also said she never had 
the raw tapes in her possession and last saw them before Rather 
went to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Babcock: ``The tapes are the exclusive property of CBS and  
not Ms. Mapes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today's hearing is the first of two battles between CBS News and  
prosecutors over the interview. On Tuesday, prosecutors initiated 
proceedings to require Rather to testify about his interview with 
Berry. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS News president Andrew Heyward said the company would fight  
both subpoena requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the process to obtain a subpoena for a witness who lives  
outside of Texas, prosecutors were required to make their request 
to Golden, who certified that Rather is a ``material and necessary 
witness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The certified request was sent to New York authorities, and a  
judge there will decide whether to compel Rather to testify in 
Texas after conducting a hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius said Thursday that the network  
has not been contacted about any hearing on the subpoena request. 
</P>
<P>
	Any such hearing is likely to come before the expected start of  
the evidence phase in Berry's trial, Nov. 9. If convicted, he faces 
either a life sentence or death by lethal injection.

	China Campaigns Against Falun Gong  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Stung by five days of defiant displays by a  
banned spiritual movement, China's communist government has opened 
a new campaign to stamp out the Falun Gong, pitching both sides 
toward more public confrontation. Evidence of the escalating 
tensions was on display today in Tiananmen Square. As teams of 
police rushed to round up Falun Gong members, a few college-age 
followers daringly unveiled a petition asking Chinese leaders for 
tolerance. Police hauled away at least 50 people, adding to the 
3,000 a Communist Party source said have been detained in Beijing 
this week.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today proposed regulations

steps to safeguard patients' most sensitive information. ``Every 
American has a right to know his or her medical records are 
protected at all times from falling into the wrong hands,'' Clinton 
said. The proposal would apply to all electronic medical records

peace treaty. The two-hour meeting between Palestinian Information 
Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo and Israeli diplomat Oded Eran came 
three days ahead of a Mideast summit in Oslo, Norway. Israel and 
the Palestinians have until February to reach a framework agreement

	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The Spanish judge who wants to put former  
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on trial for alleged human 
rights abuses is about to indict 100 Argentine military officers, a 
lawyer said today. Judge Baltasar Garzon is working on the final 
details of an indictment charging the officers with terrorism, 
genocide and torture, a Spanish attorney confirmed today. An 
Argentine government report said at least 9,000 people who 
disappeared during the 1976-1983 military regime are presumed dead. 
Some human rights groups estimate the figure is closer to 30,000.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Waves up to 25 feet pounded the West Coast,  
killing at least two people, including a bride swept to sea at 
Lover's Point as her husband took photos during their honeymoon. 
Eamon Stookesberry, 28, of Concord, dove in after his 23-year-old 
wife, Jennifer, yesterday but he couldn't reach her. Rescuers 
pulled them both from the water near Pacific Grove, 85 miles south 
of San Francisco. Mrs. Stookesberry was pronounced dead in a 
hospital. The couple were on the last day of their honeymoon, the 
groom's brother said today.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Major phone companies are sending an unusual  
New Year's plea to their customers: Don't pick up that phone! They 
fear millions of people will check for a dial tone just after 
midnight on Jan. 1 to see whether their phone service survived the 
Y2K bug. Add them to those who ring in the New Year by calling 
family, and there's a potential for a telecommunications traffic 
jam. Some callers who pick up their handsets might hear nothing or 
get a fast busy signal. The big phone companies say they've already 
solved their Year 2000 computer problems.

	Sunday Inspires Halloween Changes

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With Halloween falling on a Sunday this year,  
many communities are holding trick-or-treating tomorrow night 
instead. In some cases its because they don't want youngsters 
dressing up as demons on the Lord's day. Others note that Sunday is 
a school night or that daylight-saving time ends at 2 a.m. Sunday. 
In Salt Lake City, celebrations haven't been officially banned on 
Sunday, though the Mormon Church is asking people to pick another 
day. The Chicago suburb of Harvey moved trick-or-treating to 
tomorrow, as did the Missouri towns of Fayette and Boonville.

the sole punishment for hitting Norris after the bell at the end of 
the first round of Saturday's fight. Norris fell, dislocated his 
knee and was unable to continue.

<HEADLINE> Players at Miss. Event Mourn Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Miss. (AP) -- Ed Dougherty sought solace on the driving  
range, his emotions drained after watching television coverage of 
Payne Stewart's memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad Friday,'' said the burly Dougherty, whose eyes were  
red and swollen from tears. ``I just saw Paul Azinger's speech and 
I couldn't handle it. I knew I had to get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the service at Orlando, Fla., Stewart's hometown, Azinger  
delivered a moving tribute after donning a tam o'shanter cap and 
rolled up his pants into makeshift knickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty and many other golfers at the Southern Farm Bureau  
Classic watched TV in the clubhouse at Annandale Golf Club. About 
40 of the 131 players in the tournament flew to Florida for the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a private moment right now for his family, I don't  
know if I can handle it as well as his wife and family,'' Dougherty 
said. ``Mourning is a private thing and Payne is a public figure. 
I'm just torn between both places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty was among about 100 players and caddies who attended a  
memorial service for Stewart at a Jackson church Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As the service in Orlando was ending, about a dozen players were  
on the Annandale driving range and a half-dozen were on the 
practice green. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mostly, it's very quiet,'' said Sandy Lyle, a former Masters  
and British Open champion. ``Golfers are used to a lot of different 
routines, but this week is a little different. It's all for a good 
cause, to show our appreciation to Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With play at the Southern Farm suspended until Saturday because  
of the Stewart service, the Annandale course, except for the 
practice areas, was off limits to players. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players, like John Daly, spent the day playing at other  
courses. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Cochran, who needs a solid showing at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic to keep his PGA Tour card, flew to Florida after an 
8-under 64 gave him the first-round lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf-wise, it's probably not the best situation for me, but  
it's the right thing,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Halts Two Executions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court known for its impatience with  
death row appeals surprisingly halted two executions this week and 
is on track to issue four significant rulings on capital punishment 
by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	One case asks the justices to ban the electric chair. Two focus  
on a federal law aimed at speeding up executions. The fourth asks 
whether a person can be sentenced to die by a jury admittedly 
confused about a judge's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	The four death-penalty cases represent an unusually high  
percentage of the court's still-growing decision docket, which now 
totals 54. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect the court to scale back the states' use of  
capital punishment across the board, but this may be a year when 
important guidelines are offered,'' said Steven Hawkins, executive 
director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is the court will conclude that the time has come for  
the electric chair to be eliminated as a means of execution,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the current nine justices is unalterably opposed to  
capital punishment, as were some past justices. 
</P>
<P>
	But an hour before a Virginia death row inmate was to have died  
by lethal injection Thursday night, the justices ordered the 
execution postponed and said they will fully review his case. At 
issue is federal court access for state prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights earlier, they had similarly halted an imminent  
Florida electrocution and agreed to use that death row inmate's 
case to decide whether death in the electric chair amounts to 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Death row inmates in Arizona and Texas failed to win last-minute  
Supreme Court help this week. Those two executions raised the 
year's total to 83, the most since 1954. Across the nation, around 
3,600 convicted killers await execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over continued use of the electric chair may prove  
dramatic in light of recent experiences in Florida, where flames 
shot from one inmate's head, and another bled heavily during his 
execution. But the immediate impact of anything the court decides 
will be limited because only four states -- Florida, Alabama, 
Georgia and Nebraska -- require execution by electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court were to ban all use of the electric chair, those  
states likely would switch to a more common method such as lethal 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices are using a Virginia death row inmate's case to  
clarify an expansive 1996 federal law, the Anti-Terrorism and 
Effective Death Penalty Act. The law sharply limited federal court 
access for all defendants convicted in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in Terry Williams' case is how much discretion Congress  
wanted federal judges to have in reconsidering state courts' 
findings, particularly over the adequacy of the legal help a 
defendant received. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia death row inmate Michael Williams, who was scheduled to  
die Thursday, is challenging a portion of the 1996 law that bars 
federal judges from conducting hearings if a state prisoner 
``failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court 
proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Williams says lower courts wrongly applied that  
provision when denying him a federal court hearing because state 
prosecutors' conduct deprived him of a meaningful hearing in state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Virginia cases are narrowly focused, the court's  
decision in each could affect hundreds of inmates nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In another Virginia case, Lonnie Weeks says he was condemned  
after a judge refused to tell jurors they were not required to vote 
for death just because they had made a certain factual finding. The 
jury had told the judge it had not fully understood the sentencing 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court's appetite for death penalty disputes is not yet  
satisfied, the justices could agree -- as early as Monday -- to 
tackle a potential whopper. A pair of appeals from Nebraska and 
Florida contend that keeping a convicted killer on death row for a 
long time -- decades after his conviction and sentence -- amounts to 
unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Park Gets New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Rick Baedeker will return to Hollywood  
Park as president on Nov. 10, opening day of the autumn meet at the 
Inglewood, Calif., race track. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement was made Friday by John Long, executive vice  
president and chief operating officer of Churchill Downs Inc., 
which purchased the track last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Long said that Baedeker's ``strong background in marketing and  
public relations, combined with his knowledge of horse players and 
Southern California racing, makes him a valuable asset to Hollywood 
Park and Churchill Downs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was vice president of marketing and public relations for  
Hollywood Park from 1992 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Baedeker, a native of Glendale, Calif., has been vice president  
of communications for Television Games Network (TVG), a cable 
satellite network devoted to the coverage of horse racing and 
parimutuel wagering. 
</P>
<P>
	Before joining TVG, he was senior vice president of marketing  
for the National Thoroughbred Racing Association, and remains a 
special assistant with that group.

<HEADLINE> Three Winners at Breeders Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMPBELLVILLE, Ontario (AP) -- Three first-time Breeders Crown  
drivers guided their horses to victories Friday night in the 
divisional championships at Mohawk Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Ledford drove Eternal Camnation to her 12th consecutive  
win, the $433,900 Breeders Crown 2-Year-Old Filly Pace, his first 
start in the Breeders Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Meittinis made his driving debut in the Breeders Crown a  
major triumph when he piloted Dream Of Joy, a 34-1 long shot, to a 
win in the $443,600 Breeders Crown 2-Year-Old Filly Trot, setting a 
track record of 1:57.2. 
</P>
<P>
	Master Lavec went wire-to-wire to win the $450,700 Breeders  
Crown Colt Trot, as Dan Daley, another first time Breeders Crown 
driver, handled the reins. 
</P>
<P>
	Odies Fame, a $45,000 supplement to the Breeders Crown, went  
wire-to-wire to win the $520,000 3-Year-Old Filly Pace in 1:53. 
Last year's Canadian Horse of the Year, Odies Fame was driven by 
Dave Wall and had won eight of her 18 starts this year, raising her 
lifetime earnings to $1,020,929. 
</P>
<P>
	Eternal Camnation, who has not lost since finishing second in  
her first career start, roared through the stretch to overtake the 
leaders en route to a 1 3/4-length victory in 1:52.3, breaking her own 
track record. 
</P>
<P>
	Meittinis guided Dream of Joy through a late charge in the  
stretch to pull out her second win in eight starts. Aviano was 
second and Bold Dreamer third. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream come true,'' Meittinis said. ``I love trotting  
fillies and her trainer Per Eriksson has really helped me out and 
boosted my career this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Master Lavec, crossed the wire in 1:56.4, topping Monte Hall by  
three lengths, with Smokn Lantern third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pulled the ear plugs around the final turn and one of them  
didn't really pop out properly, but he was wound up enough so it 
didn't really matter,'' Daley said.

<HEADLINE> Cyclone Slams India's Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BHUBANESWAR, India (AP) -- A powerful cyclone, the second in two  
weeks, slammed into India's eastern coast today as authorities 
packed villagers into trucks and evacuated 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclone, bearing winds up to 155 mph, hit along 300 miles of  
coastline. It was the second major cyclone to hit the same area in 
Orissa state in the past 12 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were reported killed by a collapsing wall in Orissa,  
and at least 30 were injured in neighboring Midnapore district in 
West Bengal state when their homes collapsed, Press Trust of India 
news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 200 fishermen were missing, and another 4,000 fishermen  
were caught in heavy seas but were in radio contact, United News of 
India reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Early reports said two people were crushed to death by a wall  
that collapsed in the port city of Paradwip, where 2,000 houses 
were damaged, Press Trust of India reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when the full-blown storm was still several miles offshore,  
powerful winds flattened simple mud huts and uprooted trees. 
Telephone lines were knocked out, making it difficult to get an 
accurate account of the storm's severity in Paradwip, about 55 
miles east of the Orissa state capital, Bhubaneswar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Its a rare supercyclone,'' said L.K. Chand of the  
meteorological office in Bhubaneswar. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee ordered thousands of  
soldiers stationed in the area to be ready to help with 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	District officials sent trucks to coastal villages to move  
residents to solidly built schools and public buildings. The 
evacuation began Thursday evening and went on through the night. 
</P>
<P>
	By midday today, the sky turned inky black and waves rearing 13  
to 15 feet high crashed against the shore. The government canceled 
trains traveling to and from the area, fearing the wind would blow 
carriages off their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in the coastal districts stocked up on food and other  
essential in anticipation of shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the Bay of Bengal, authorities in  
Bangladesh scaled down their storm warning, but thousands of 
volunteers remained on an evacuation alert. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 12 days ago, more than 100 people were killed and more than  
1,000 injured by another cyclone that roared in from the Bay of 
Bengal and devastated the Orissa coastline.

<HEADLINE> Chafee's Death Opens Assignment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans have a plum committee  
assignment to fill, the seat on the tax-writing Finance Committee 
that Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island held at the time of his death 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under GOP rules, memberships on the panel are awarded strictly  
by seniority, although a senator may not sit on any one of three 
other panels -- Appropriations, Foreign Relations or Armed Services 
-- at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senior Republicans have passed up Finance Committee  
seats before and are certain to do so again -- Sen. Ted Stevens of 
Alaska, who chairs the Appropriations Committee, for example, as 
well as other members of his panel who are subcommittee chairmen. 
</P>
<P>
	Much attention has been focused on Chafee's chairmanship at the  
Environment and Public Works Committee, a spot for which New 
Hampshire Sen. Bob Smith, a one-time Republican on the verge of 
rejoining the GOP, and Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe are vying. 
</P>
<P>
	But a seat on the Finance Committee is highly coveted, given its  
jurisdiction over taxes, trade, Medicare and welfare programs, and 
its traditional entree to fund-raising sources. 
</P>
<P>
	And if enough senators decide to take a pass, it could become a  
very valuable consolation prize for Smith or Inhofe. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Ten days after the demise of campaign finance legislation in the  
Senate, a bipartisan group of senators is trying a new approach. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, introduced by Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., four fellow  
Republicans and two Democrats, would limit soft money contributions 
to the political parties and raise the current ceiling for 
donations by individuals to candidates. It also includes 
requirements for stricter disclosure of campaign contributions and 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagel said he was proposing his legislation as a ``bipartisan  
alternative in what has been a very polarized debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His measure would limit soft money donations to $60,000 per  
organization. Soft money applies to funds donated by individuals, 
corporations and unions to political parties, and currently there 
are no limits on their size. 
</P>
<P>
	Donations to candidates, referred to as hard money and currently  
limited to $1,000, would rise to $3,000 to take into account the 
effects of inflation since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, legislation that died in the Senate this month at  
the hands of a Republican filibuster would have banned soft money 
but made no change in hard money limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hagel said he had intended to seek a vote on his measure as part  
of the recent campaign finance debate in the Senate, but was 
prevented from doing so by the parliamentary snarl that developed. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Mattoon, a phone company lobbyist and longtime adviser to  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, is taking over as top staff aide at 
the House GOP campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattoon will become deputy chairman at the committee at the  
beginning of the year. He effectively replaces Scott Hatch, who had 
been serving as executive director, and will begin an indefinite 
medical leave. 
</P>
<P>
	Mattoon is a vice president at BellSouth Corp., with  
responsibilities for the company's legislative and political 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	As coordinator of the BellSouth political action committee, he  
oversaw the donations of more than $1.5 million to congressional 
candidates in the 1997-1998 election cycle.

	Mattoon is a former aide at the National Republican  
Congressional Committee, and also served as an aide to Hastert's 
predecessor in the House. Several GOP aides, who spoke on condition 
of anonymity, said his selection signals Hastert's desire to have a 
stronger presence at the campaign committee, which will lay an 
important role in determining the fate of the GOP majority in next 
year's elections.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Cos. Block British Ad Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Tobacco companies won a court order Friday to  
prevent the government from banning advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The government, which planned to start phasing in the ban on  
Dec. 10, said it would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tobacco Manufacturers Association and major companies --  
Imperial, Gallaher, Rothmans UK and British American Tobacco -- 
argued that the ban should not be imposed while they are still 
pursuing a legal challenge through European courts. 
</P>
<P>
	High Court Justice Michael Turner ruled that it was ``strongly  
arguable'' that the tobacco companies would succeed in their 
European court case. A judgment is expected late next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government argued that the ban should be introduced as soon  
as possible in the interest of public health. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies, however, contended that there was no urgency,  
because advertising only affected consumer choice of brands and did 
not encourage anyone to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a pity that we had to take this action,'' said Paul  
Sadler of Imperial Tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have cooperated fully for many years, in operating a system  
of voluntary agreements, and hope that effective dialogue between 
manufacturers and government can now be reinstated.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland High School Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Authorities ordered a high school closed today  
after they uncovered an apparent plot by students to stage 
``violent acts'' there. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a published report today, several South High School  
students admitted planning an attack with guns and explosives, 
similar to the one carried out by two students at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo., last April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a plan to disrupt the school with violent  
acts,'' Mayor Michael R. White said Thursday night at a news 
conference at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	A South High student learned of the plot Wednesday morning and  
alerted her parents. One of the parents notified the school, The 
Plain Dealer reported today, citing a source close to the 
investigation. The school has 1,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, some students dressed in black got the attention of  
school security officers. They were questioned about the rumored 
attack and were sent home with parents, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Columbine, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 13  
people and wounded 23 others at the school on April 20 before 
killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	South High's homecoming game and dance scheduled for tonight  
were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and school security checked the high school locker by  
locker Thursday night for weapons and explosive devices, White 
said. None were found. 
</P>
<P>
	But White said some ``documents'' that were found Thursday  
appear to be evidence of a planned attack. He refused to specify 
what those documents were. Eleven students at the school face 
possible disciplinary action, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer reported that some students gave written  
statements to police. The statements said they planned to use guns, 
which were to be obtained from a gang, and homemade explosives to 
kill teachers, administrators and fellow students, the newspaper 
said. It was unclear whether the students had already obtained any 
weapons, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the statements, the massacre was planned for just  
before noon today, with students opening fire in the school 
cafeterias and the principal's office. The students planned to 
conclude with a suicidal shootout with police in a courtyard, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a matter that is literally unfolding minute to  
minute,'' White said. ``We have an obligation to only communicate 
what we know to be true and to keep the conjecture and rumors at 
bay until we know what is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the investigation, security at all 120 schools in  
the 77,000-student district was being increased today. 
</P>
<P>
	South High School is to reopen Monday with additional security  
officers and hand-held metal detectors to scan students before they 
enter, he said.

<HEADLINE> Phone Cos. Brace for New Year's Eve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Major phone companies are sending an unusual  
New Year's plea to their customers: Don't pick up that phone! 
</P>
<P>
	They fear millions of people will check for a dial tone just  
after midnight on Jan. 1 to see whether their phone service 
survived the Y2K bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Add them to all the folks who ring in the New Year by calling  
family, and there's a potential for a telecommunications traffic 
jam. Some callers who pick up their handsets might hear nothing or 
get a fast busy signal. 
</P>
<P>
	But that won't necessarily indicate that Year 2000 problems have  
wrecked the network, say companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because you pick up the telephone at or around midnight  
Dec. 31st and get a busy signal doesn't mean you've been bitten by 
the Y2K bug,'' said Bill Kula of GTE. Y2K problems arise from 
breakdowns in computer systems that read only the last two digits 
in a year and interpret 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	The big phone companies say they've already solved their Year  
2000 computer problems, after spending more than $2.8 billion to 
upgrade their networks and supporting systems. Yet they are 
shelling out extra cash to urge consumers not to flood the system 
at midnight. They are using inserts in phone bills, grassroots 
information sessions and advertising to spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Federal Communications Commission says most small and  
midsize carriers expect to be compliant in time, some -- estimated 
to carry less than 1 percent of total phone access lines -- may not 
be. The FCC doesn't expect this to affect call processing and 
completion. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jim Lord, who wrote a book about the problem and publishes a  
bimonthly Y2K newsletter, cautions about the telecommunications 
industry: ``All of the information we have is based on 
self-reporting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There is also less certainty about international calls, since  
they could hinge on the Year 2000 readiness of foreign countries' 
infrastructures and domestic phone systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think some folks will be disappointed because they will try  
to call other countries and some of those calls might not go 
through,'' said AT&AMP;T spokesman Dave Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	Phone companies, bracing for congestion, are urging consumers  
not to pick up their phone just to see if the line is working and 
are hoping they will space out their calls. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't even test it,'' is the advice of Bell Atlantic spokesman  
Jim Smith. ``It's going to work. Don't make yourself nervous by 
running into a backed-up network.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several companies anticipate some phone system blockages during  
the weekend -- particularly in the hours right after midnight and in 
the morning when people are calling relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimates vary. But one high-end figure predicts the number of  
people picking up their phones then will be 11 times that of 
Mother's Day -- one of the year's busiest calling times, said Dave 
Bolger of the U.S. Telephone Association, which represents phone 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can clog the system even without dialing because just  
taking the phone off the hook engages the system. Once the system 
reaches a certain threshold, machines monitoring the traffic might 
start to block dial tones or send fast busy signals. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West has tried to calm customers' nerves with newspaper ads  
showing a sun rising over the trees and telling consumers that on 
Jan. 1, ``the phones will ring.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company also set up a number that consumers can dial to  
simulate a call in the Year 2000: The call is placed through Y2K 
compliant equipment through systems with the date set one year 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	``This way, consumers are not just relying on our corporate  
speak,'' said William White, the company's chief technology 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Another concern is that people might dial 911 to check the  
number, even if there's no emergency. 
</P>
<P>
	GTE has ``encouraged our customers to think about the millennium  
and the use of the telephone as they would in a hurricane or 
earthquake,'' Kula said.

<HEADLINE> Devils 4, Hurricanes 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- New Jersey scored three goals in a  
three-minute span early in the third period as the Devils spoiled 
the opening of the Carolina Hurricanes' new arena with a 4-2 
victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina goaltender Arturs Irbe was sharp for the first 40  
minutes as Carolina led 1-0 heading to the final period. But Irbe 
let in a soft goal from the blue line by 26-year-old rookie Brian 
Rafalski 51 seconds into the period. Krzyszlof Oliwa and Petr 
Sykora followed with scores shortly thereafter as the large crowd 
grew quiet. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Rafalski's first NHL goal, while Oliwa scored his fourth  
of the season and Sykora his second. 
</P>
<P>
	A tip-in by Bates Battaglia with 11:22 left brought the crowd  
back into the game but the Devils, the best road team in hockey a 
season ago with an NHL-record 28 wins, held on down the stretch, 
scoring an empty-net goal by Randy McKay with four seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey also beat Atlanta earlier in the month when the  
Thrashers opened their new home. 
</P>
<P>
	The unveiling of the $158 million Raleigh Entertainment and  
Sports Arena drew a sellout crowd of 18,730 as fans welcomed the 
team back from an NHL record-tying nine-game road trip that 
produced a solid 4-2-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
	One fan dressed as an Arab held up a sign that read: ``Nomads No  
More'' in reference to the team's two-year, 160-mile roundtrip trek 
for home games in Greensboro while the new Raleigh arena was being 
built. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hurricanes came out sluggish after five days off and were  
outshot 12-6 in the opening period as the hard-checking Devils took 
the crowd out of the game. But Andrei Kovalenko's rebound goal 
early in the second period sparked Carolina and its crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian jumped on the puck after Devils goaltender Martin  
Brodeur had stopped a hard shot from defenseman Curtis Leschyshyn, 
but couldn't control the rebound. Kovalenko waited until Brodeur 
committed, then lifted a backhander high into the net. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey's Ken Daneyko played in his 1,000th NHL game -- all  
with New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Sprague Will Start Ahead of Biffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FONTANA, Calif. (AP) -- Advantage, Jack Sprague.  
</P>
<P>
	Bidding for his second NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series  
championship but trailing rival Greg Biffle by 21 points entering 
Saturday's season-ending NAPA Auto Parts 200 at California 
Speedway, Sprague grabbed the No. 3 starting position for the race 
he won a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 series champion outqualified Biffle by 21 positions in  
the 36-truck field Friday, posting a lap of 173.456 mph. He was 
just fractionally slower than Andy Houston, who backed up his 1998 
California Speedway pole winning speed with a fast lap of 173.561. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston and outside front row starter Jay Sauter, both in  
Chevrolets, bettered Mike Bliss' 2-year-old qualifying record of 
173.198 despite hot, windy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprague, who discounted his chances after two rounds of  
practice, will start nine places higher than he did in 1998, when 
he edged Ernie Irvan in the tour's fastest race, completed at an 
average speed of 141.844. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll also start ahead of the third driver in the 1999  
championship hunt, Dennis Setzer, who'll line up eighth in a Dodge. 
Setzer settled for a fourth-row berth after topping Friday's 
practice charts during a cool, early morning session. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a hair-raising qualifying lap,'' Sprague said.  
``Hopefully, this Chevrolet will race well tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Setzer's speed was 171.784 while Biffle, whose worst start of  
the year was 14th prior to Friday's time trials, was clocked at 
168.444. 
</P>
<P>
	``This wasn't the lap we wanted,'' Biffle said. ``The wind  
really messed things up. I was actually off the gas and still got 
blown up the track. The wall was coming up and I was going straight 
at it. We'll be fine for the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biffle can clinch the championship by finishing third.  
</P>
<P>
	Houston's first pole of the season came in his 40th start since  
posting his only previous pole lap of a two-season career. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston, a second-generation driver from Hickory, N.C., enters  
Saturday's $431,590 race eighth in the driver standings. The son of 
NASCAR Busch Series standout Tommy Houston hasn't won since August 
1998, when he bested Biffle in a final-lap battle at New Hampshire 
International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as perfect a lap as we've run since we've been here in  
California,'' Houston said. ``We've got a good race set-up and I 
think we can win this show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sauter, meanwhile, hopes to match a series record by winning his  
third consecutive race. The Wisconsin native, the winner earlier 
this month at Louisville, Ky. and Fort Worth, Texas will be making 
his final appearance for the Richard Childress team. Sauter, who 
qualified at 173.456, moves to the NASCAR Busch Series in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Ruttman, who turned 55 on Thursday, will start third in a  
Dodge owned by NASCAR Winston Cup veteran Bobby Hamilton. Ruttman 
lapped the 2-mile superspeedway at 172.790. Hamilton also made the 
starting lineup, in 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacy Compton, the season's leading pole winner, settled for  
fifth in a Dodge at 171.981, joined on the third row by Ron 
Hornaday, whose Chevrolet lapped at 171.895.

<HEADLINE> Obuchi Opens Parliament Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi opened  
Parliament session today by promising to spur economic growth 
through increased government spending and efforts to encourage 
venture businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Obuchi said the government will propose an extra budget of more  
than $950 billion, with the money used to encourage individual 
spending and capital investment by companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The prime minister said easing regulations and making financing  
easier for small- and mid-sized companies were key to keeping 
Japan's economic recovery on track. Encouraging venture business is 
still relatively rare in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to christen this session of Parliament the  
`small- and mid- sized companies session,''' Obuchi said. ``I will 
be asking Parliament to deliberate on bills that will allow us to 
undertake a radical review and extension of measures for such 
companies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's economy is showing signs of life after suffering through  
the nation's worst downturn in 50 years. The economy has grown two 
quarters in a row and the jobless rate is easing from record highs. 
Unemployment edged down in September to 4.6 percent from 4.7 
percent the previous month, the government announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	The funds set aside in the new budget would be spent before  
Japan's fiscal year ends on March 31, 2000. It follows a first 
extra budget of about $5.2 billion approved in July as a way to 
create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending proposals are likely to be approved when they come  
before Parliament sometime next month, since Obuchi's ruling 
coalition controls a majority in both the upper and lower houses.

<HEADLINE> NFL Says No Electronic Earplugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams planned to use  
electronic earplugs to drown out crowd noise Sunday at the 
Tennessee Titans' stadium, but the NFL says that violates league 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans notified the NFL after seeing an item on the Internet  
about Rams coach Dick Vermeil's plans for offensive linemen to wear 
the earplugs that can be set to drown out all noise except the 
voice of quarterback Kurt Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know there was a rule against it,'' Vermeil said  
Thursday. ``I thought innovation was a part of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL bars use of any electronic device on the field, with the  
exception of a coach-to-quarterback communication system. 
</P>
<P>
	The sold-out stadium, which seats 67,000, will be the largest  
crowd the Rams have played in front of on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Word's getting around that Adelphia Coliseum is a tough place  
to play and we have to continue to build that home-field advantage, 
make it the toughest to play in the NFL,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher 
said.

<HEADLINE>  GOP Hopefuls Debate in N.H. Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Next time, Gov. George W. Bush's rivals for  
the Republican presidential nomination will be debating against him 
instead of about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Governor Bush will be very active in this campaign,  
particularly since we're moving up so rapidly in the polls,'' said 
Sen. John McCain, who trails Bush but is gaining. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he'd have preferred to have Bush participate in the  
forum at Dartmouth College Thursday night because New Hampshire 
voters deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator, publisher Steve Forbes, conservative  
activist Gary Bauer, commentator Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of 
Utah went ahead without Bush, meeting for the second time in a week 
in a 60-minute question-and-answer format. 
</P>
<P>
	They sparred at times, but it was no slugfest as they stated  
their positions on taxes, abortion and assorted other issues, 
without much argument. It was not direct debate. They got questions 
in turn, 90 seconds to answer, no rebuttal time. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New Hampshire polls, McCain trails Bush by 12 to 16  
points. The others are far behind, registering in single digits. 
McCain said he does not discount them, recalling that he was down 
there, too, not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he is gaining traction, and he sought to add to it  
Thursday night by sticking to his message of reform, a point he 
made on almost every question put to him. He said patients' medical 
rights, school voucher funding, money to meet the needs of military 
families, and his standard, political finances, are all in need of 
reform that can't happen until the power of special interest money 
is curbed. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain continued today to press the case for campaign finance  
overhaul, a topic that drew several questions from a crowd of 100 
people attending an early morning town hall meeting in Walpole. 
``This is an incumbency protection racket that keeps incumbents in 
office, but until I draw my last breath I will fight for the 
issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes took the hardest shot of the night at Bush for his  
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps in the future, at a forum like this, if we call it a  
fund-raiser he might show up,'' said the magazine heir, who is 
financing his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has said he will come to the Republicans' debate in  
Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2. And the absentee got a solo interview 
on WMUR-TV, a local station, two hours before the hourlong debate 
it co-sponsored with CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he regretted missing it, but preferred to be at a  
ceremony honoring his wife, Laura, at Southern Methodist University 
in Dallas. ``I'm sorry I'm not there, I look forward to the 
debates, I've got a lot to say,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of work to do, I take nothing for  
granted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a front-runner would get that TV treatment. But it also  
showed that Bush is wary of the absentee argument against him. His 
campaign issued statements explaining his absence. He had planned 
to stay out of debates until January. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer did take a slap at Forbes on another point, saying that  
his proposed flat tax would favor corporations over families. 
``Gary, you're wrong,'' Forbes countered. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain urged Republican openness to differences on the abortion  
issue, repeating that he is firmly opposed to the practice. None of 
the more conservative candidates challenged him on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have respectful disagreements on specific issues, and  
we can work together on this one,'' he said of the party's most 
divisive social policy dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,  
the Democratic candidates, met in their first question-and-answer 
debate Wednesday night. When the moderator at the GOP forum asked 
who in that crowd had watched the Democrats, McCain's hand was one 
of those that went up. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said the Democratic contest might have a bearing on his,  
because about one-third of New Hampshire voters are independents 
and can vote in either party primary on Feb. 1. So independents 
could be pivotal. ``Senator Bradley is appealing to a lot of 
independents,'' he said before the debate. ``I am, too.''

<HEADLINE> Block on EPA Pollution Rules Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court on Friday reaffirmed a  
decision blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing 
tougher air pollution controls on smog and soot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a split ruling, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia rejected the government's appeal and kept in 
place a decision in May by a three-judge panel from the court 
overturning the new pollution regulations imposed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials said the Justice Department is  
expected to take the case to the Supreme Court with hopes of a 
decision by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the appeal process moves forward, we will continue to  
pursue all available actions to secure cleaner air for the American 
people,'' EPA Administrator Carol Browner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton in 1997 directed the EPA to issue the tougher  
air rules, which require states to meet more stringent reductions 
in smog-causing ozone and in microscopic soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The smog and soot regulations were among the most controversial  
ever issued by Browner and drew strong opposition from business and 
industry groups. Environmental and many health experts argued the 
more stringent controls on soot and smog were needed to protect 
children and people with respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	But in May, a three-judge panel of the appeals court decided 2-1  
to overturn the regulation, saying the EPA had failed to justify 
the pollution levels it selected. The panel also said the soot rule 
was an ``unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority'' 
under the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, five judges on the full 11-member appeals court  
supported the EPA, while four upheld the lower court decision, and 
two did not take part. A majority of the full court was needed to 
approve the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups, which had filed the lawsuit challenging the  
regulations, applauded the decision by the full court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a victory for all businesses and a blow to the EPA,''  
said Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Once 
again the court agreed with American business that the EPA 
standards were pulled out of thin air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browner said that while she was ``disappointed'' by the full  
appeals court decision, ``we are encouraged that five of the nine 
judges agreed with the EPA argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency intends to ask the Justice Department to take the  
case to the Supreme Court as quickly as possible, with hopes that 
it could be heard during the court's spring session next year, 
agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised air standards imposed by the EPA in 1997 limited  
ozone, an essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, 
instead of 0.12 parts per million under the previous requirement. 
For the first time they also required that states regulate 
microscopic particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and 
other sources down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the 
width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups waged an intense battle against the regulation  
before they were issued in 1997, arguing they were too costly and 
not grounded in adequate science. Later, a broad cross-section of 
groups representing the trucking, utility, chemical, oil and auto 
industries, as well as small businesses, challenged the rules in a 
lawsuit. Three states -- Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia -- also 
joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Browner announced the EPA was reimposing the old ozone  
standard, while the litigation proceeds on the new standard. If the 
tougher air requirements are killed, ``125 million Americans, 
including 35 million children, will breathe air that doesn't meet 
health standards based on modern science,'' Browner has argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing the dissent, Judge David Tatel said in Friday's ruling  
that the three-judge panel's decision in May departed ``from a 
half-century of Supreme Court separation of powers jurisprudence'' 
and stripped the EPA of its ability to implement the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatel also had dissented in the May 14 decision.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Azinger Eulogizes Stewart Crashed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- In a memorial service filled with many of  
the greatest golfers ever to take up the game, Payne Stewart was 
remembered Friday as a tough competitor who was ``gracious in 
victory and gracious in defeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart was a vicious competitor. He only played to  
win,'' said Paul Azinger, who donned a tam o'shanter cap and rolled 
up his trousers to reveal a pair of argyle socks in honor of his 
friend's trademark look. 
</P>
<P>
	Everyone laughed and applauded, the only time they did so during  
the two-hour memorial service at First Baptist Church attended by 
some 3,000 friends, family and golf fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, who won 18 victories, including two U.S. Opens and a  
PGA Championship, was killed along with five other people Monday 
when his Learjet flew uncontrolled across the country until running 
out of fuel and crashing in a pasture in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The 42-year-old was eulogized as a buoyant man with a passion  
for his family, his faith and for the game he played. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the night of our first date, I can honestly tell you this  
is the man I wanted to share the rest of my life with,'' said his 
widow, Tracey, the mother of his son and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	As she left the church, Stewart's fellow golfers lined each side  
of the center aisle. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart had been planning to play in the Tour Championship in  
Houston. The tournament began Thursday and was suspended Friday to 
allow the golfers to attend the funeral. It resumes on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 29-player field from the tournament attended, along  
with at least 70 other professionals, including Jack Nicklaus, 
Tiger Woods, David Duval, Davis Love III, Justin Leonard, Greg 
Norman, Ben Crenshaw, Lanny Wadkins and Tom Kite. 
</P>
<P>
	Below the pulpit where Azinger spoke was the gold Ryder Cup,  
which normally never leaves PGA of America headquarters. It sat on 
a table spread with some of Stewart's other trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	Also displayed were photos of his family on a rafting trip, and  
one picture taken nine days earlier with 10-year-old Aaron at the 
Father-Child tournament before the Disney Classic, Stewart's final 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	His children contributed a set of buck teeth, one of Stewart's  
favorite props in his role as practical joker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always enjoyed Payne. I never knew if he was kidding half  
the time,'' Nicklaus said after the service. ``He always had a 
needle out to jab, but he was having fun. He had fun when he played 
golf, and he had fun when he was serious.''

<HEADLINE> Police Depts. Grew in Mid-1990s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The growth of police and sheriffs' departments  
accelerated during the mid-1990s to a total of 595,000 officers 
with arrest power by June 1997, the Justice Department reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its most recent census, the Bureau of Justice Statistics  
found that local police departments grew an average of 3 percent a 
year between 1993 and June 1997, compared with 1 percent a year 
from 1987 through 1993. Sheriffs' departments grew an average of 
4.4 percent annually between 1993 and June 1997, compared with 3.1 
percent a year from 1987 through 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Total police department employment reached an estimated 531,496  
by June 1997, of whom 420,000 were sworn officers with arrest 
authority. Sheriffs' departments employed 263,427 by June 1997, of 
whom 175,000 had arrest authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The period of increased growth includes the beginnings of the  
Clinton administration's eight-year Community Oriented Policing 
Services, or COPS, program enacted in 1994 to put an additional 
100,000 local police officers on the street. But there is a lag 
between the award of grants and the arrival of new officers on 
patrol, so as of this year, about 55,000 of the new officers have 
reached street work, the administration has said. 
</P>
<P>
	The COPS program encourages local departments to use the new  
officers in community policing programs that involve citizens and 
other public agencies in police work. The survey found that by June 
1997, 56 percent of local police officers worked for a department 
with a formal, written community policing policy, as did 33 percent 
of sheriffs' officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found increasing numbers of minority officers  
and more departments requiring college training. 
</P>
<P>
	Racial and ethnic minorities comprised 21.5 percent of sworn  
police officers in June 1997, compared with 19.1 percent in 1993 
and 14.6 percent in 1987. Sworn officers from minority groups in 
sheriffs' departments rose from 13.4 in 1987 to 19 percent in June 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall in 1997, 14 percent of all police departments, employing  
31 percent of all officers, required new recruits to have at least 
some college courses, compared with 12 percent of the departments, 
with 15 percent of all officers, in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Among sheriffs' departments, 11 percent required some college  
work of new deputies, up from 7 percent in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	A four-year college degree was required by 1 percent of both  
police and sheriffs' departments in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting salaries for local police officers averaged $28,400,  
ranging from $18,800 in the smallest jurisdictions to $30,600 in 
the largest cities. Sheriffs' deputies started at an average of 
$26,000, with a low of $19,400 and high of $30,200. Two-thirds of 
all local police officers and half of all sheriffs' deputies worked 
for departments with collective bargaining.

<HEADLINE> Senior Golfers Remember Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gathering to the music of a bagpipe player,  
PGA Senior Tour players held a memorial service for Payne Stewart 
on the 10th green at the Wilshire Country Club on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very emotional day for most of the players. There  
wasn't just one thing I remember about Payne. There was a 
collection,'' Gary McCord said as players and spectators crowded 
around the green following the first round of the Pacific Bell 
Seniors tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, there was always that grin. It always cheered you up.  
He always had a twinkle in his eye,'' McCord said. ``You would 
always have the thought that he knew something you didn't. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Green said, ``I loved him on the course, I loved him off  
the course. This is really hard for me to stomach. We lost a great 
person. Payne, we'll never forget you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Floyd followed Green to the microphone on the green and  
had difficulty fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a tragic loss to golf and we lost a friend,'' Floyd said.  
``He brought grace and dignity to the game. He was caring, loving, 
sharing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd recalled Stewart as his teammate on the 1989 Ryder Cup  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere in the Belfry in the middle of England, Payne had a  
boom box. He'd go running up and down the halls, pounding on our 
doors to make sure we heard Bruce Springsteen singing `Born in the 
U.S.A.,''' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale Irwin said Stewart left a legacy for the sport.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we can all take away something from his examples -- have  
a great life, enjoy it, have fun while you are at it -- imprinted on 
all of us,'' Irwin said.

<HEADLINE> Mass. H.S. Students Grill Hatch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- A day after debating his Republican  
presidential rivals, Sen. Orrin Hatch let a group of Concord High 
School students have at him on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Most grilled him about school violence.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he considered to be the main cause, the Utah senator  
said it ``comes from the heat of passion -- people who haven't 
learned how to control their emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told of getting beaten up by a bully as a child and how it  
made him determined to fight back the next time. He said he threw 
his next opponent into the mud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ashamed of doing that, but proud of standing up for  
myself,'' said Hatch, a Mormon. ``Had I not had the religious 
training I had, and the kind of parents I had, I might have turned 
to a life of crime. It was that tough of a neighborhood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jill Hoffman, 17, asked whether he thought violent television  
shows, music and video games contributed to violence in schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch turned the question around, asking how many of the  
students believed the entertainment industry is a factor in 
violence. After only five raised their hands, Hatch told the rest 
they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question there is a correlation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman then asked how he'd solve the problem as president.  
Perplexed by his answer -- Hatch promised to encourage state and 
local authorities to enforce laws -- she pressed him again. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the media, do you plan to stop them from having shows  
that little kids can watch and get ideas from?'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch said he would work with Hollywood to urge them to tone  
down such violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a difference between the real world and movies that  
incite young people to do vicious things,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoffman said later she was frustrated with his answers.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he answered it until the third time I asked, and  
even then, he didn't answer it completely,'' she said. ``I wish 
he'd explain more in detail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, meeting with supporters at his state campaign office,  
Hatch said Thursday's debate proved he is the only candidate with 
enough experience to be president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you ought to be elected to something else before you  
run for president,'' he said. ``I think Gary Bauer and Steve Forbes 
did a good job, and I love Alan Keyes, but let's face it, these 
guys have never been on the firing line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that Republicans will be turned off by Sen. John  
McCain's criticism of senators who disagreed with his legislation 
to overhaul campaign finance laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. McCain really offended most of us. In his zeal to talk  
straight, he's talked rotten,'' Hatch said. ``I resent anyone 
implying that a lot of my colleagues who are working their guts out 
to do what's right have this appearance of corruption.''

<HEADLINE> `Ragtime' Closing on Broadway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Ragtime,'' the epic, turn-of-the-century  
Broadway musical based on the E.L. Doctorow novel, will close Jan. 
16 after a two-year run. 
</P>
<P>
	The show, which will have played 861 performances, has not  
recouped its initial production costs, estimated at more than $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is never easy to make the decision to close a show,'' Scott  
Zeiger, head of SFX Entertainment, said Thursday. SFX took over the 
musical from the bankrupt Livent earlier this year. ``We look 
forward to continuing our rewarding collaboration on the national 
tour of `Ragtime.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ragtime,'' which has a cast of 59, has high running expenses,  
estimated at over $500,000 a week. The musical, which is playing at 
the large Ford Center for the Performing Arts, has faltered at the 
box office in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	A national tour of the musical is currently playing Pittsburgh  
and is booked through 2001.

<HEADLINE> New-Home Sales Fall in September Floyd Rakes East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By JEANNINE AVERSA 	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sales of new homes fell a steep 12.8 percent  
in September to the lowest level in almost two years as mortgage 
rates climbed and Hurricane Floyd raked the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that sales of new  
single-family homes decreased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 811,000 units last month. That was the lowest level since 
December 1997, when an annual rate of 791,000 units were sold. 
</P>
<P>
	While new-home sales were down in all parts of the country, the  
average new-home price hit an all-time high last month. 
</P>
<P>
	September's performance followed a revised August sales pace of  
930,000 units, which was much lower than the 983,000 units the 
government previously estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month's sales were weaker than many analysts expected. They  
were forecasting a rate of 950,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthly average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in  
September was 7.82 percent, up from 6.72 percent a year earlier, 
but lower than August's 7.94 percent average rate, according to 
Freddie Mac, the mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	A report released Monday showed Americans bought fewer existing  
homes in September, deterred by higher mortgage rates and the 
hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though sales of existing homes fell 2.1 percent in  
September, the third straight monthly decline, such sales are still 
heading toward a banner year. That's because low unemployment, tame 
inflation and stock and bond market gains continue to make 
Americans feel wealthy and comfortable about making purchases, 
economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	The average price for a a new home sold in September set a  
record of $196,900, up from $192,400 last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the median price for a new home -- meaning half of all  
homes sold in September sold for less and half for more -- was 
$160,000, up from August's median price of $153,900. September's 
median home price tied a record set in April. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the West took the biggest hit, posting a 14.8 decline  
to an annual rate of 213,000 units in September. In the Midwest, 
new-home sales fell 14.2 percent to an annual rate of 175,000 
units. New-home sales in the South dropped by 11.3 percent to an 
annual rate of 345,000 units and sales in the Northeast declined by 
8.1 percent to an annual rate of 79,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve policy-makers next meet on Nov. 16 and many  
analysts expect them to nudge up interest rates for a third time 
this year to slow the economy and keep inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the government reported that the nation's economic  
growth bounced back at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the third 
quarter following a sluggish 1.9 percent growth rate in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans' borrowing costs rose when the Fed raised interest  
rates twice this year -- in June and August -- making borrowing more 
expensive.

<HEADLINE> Family Seats a Congress Tradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking over the family business is still in  
style in Congress, with several dozen offspring and widows of 
former members holding seats and several more trying to join the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Rhode Island Sen. John Chafee this week raised the  
possibility his son Lincoln could join several dozen offspring and 
three widows of former members who have made holding a seat in 
Congress a family tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	Politics as a family affair is also much in evidence in the  
battle for the White House, where George W. Bush, the son of a 
president, and Al Gore, the son of a senator, are leading 
presidential contenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last year, five lawmakers with family ties to Capitol Hill  
joined Congress. Already for the 2000 campaign, two retiring 
lawmakers, six-term Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and five-term Rep. 
Tom Ewing, R-Ill., have designated their sons as their political 
heirs. 
</P>
<P>
	The new legislators who made winning seem like old hat were:  
</P>
<P>
	--Charles Gonzalez, D-Texas, who took over the San Antonio seat  
held by his father Henry for 37 years. 
</P>
<P>
	--the Udall cousins, Tom, D-N.M., and Mark, D-Colo., who carried  
on the legacies of their respective fathers, Stewart and Morris 
</P>
<P>
	--Rush Holt, D-N.J., who brought back memories of his father, a  
West Virginia senator. 
</P>
<P>
	--Evan Bayh, D-Ind., won a Senate seat once held by his father,  
Birch, for three terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the leaders in longevity are the Dingells. Rep. John  
Dingell, D-Mich., the senior Democrat in the House, and his father 
have represented Detroit since 1932. Possible successors if the 
73-year-old Dingell decides to step down are his wife and son. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa., in 1974 took over the seat held by  
his father for six terms. The father of Rep. Walter B. Jones, Jr., 
R-N.C., served 26 years as a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is carrying on the political  
tradition of her father, a former House member and mayor of 
Baltimore. Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., in 1992 took over 
her father's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, is the son of  
longtime Sen. Walter Bennett. Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., 
learned the trade from his father, former Sen. Thomas Dodd. 
</P>
<P>
	There are now three widows of former members in the House: Mary  
Bono, R-Calif., Lois Capps, D-Calif., and Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the more obvious incentives for offspring eyeing  
political careers -- the instant name recognition and ready access 
to financial backers -- ``there are certain families that have a 
commitment to public service,'' said Senate historian Donald 
Ritchie. ``It goes back to the earliest Congresses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Encyclopedia of the U.S. Congress says 16 ``dynasty''  
families have produced, in addition to eight presidents, 30 
senators and 56 House members. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those prominent families, seven Breckinridges have been  
elected to Congress from Kentucky since 1801. Six Claibornes from 
the South date back to the 18th century. That is in addition to 
recently retired Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and former Rep. 
Corrine Claiborne ``Lindy'' Boggs, D-La., the widow of House 
Majority Leader Thomas Hale Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
	George Cabot, Massachusetts senator in the 1790s, was the  
great-great grandfather of Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., a senator until 
1952 when he was defeated by John F. Kennedy. Today the Kennedys 
are represented by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and his son, Rep. 
Patrick Kennedy, D-R.I. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clays, the La Follettes and the Longs are among other names  
that are fixtures in Congress. Rep. Huey ``the Kingfish'' Long, 
D-La., was succeeded by both his wife, Rose, and his son, Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, R-N.J., is among six from his family  
to have served in Congress; the first was in the Continental 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Others with famous political fathers include Rep. John Sununu,  
R-N.H., son of the former White House chief of staff; Rep. Jesse 
Jackson Jr., son of the civil rights leader; Sen. Charles Robb, 
D-Va., son-in-law of President Johnson; and Sen. Mary Landrieu, 
D-La., daughter of the former New Orleans mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Blood ties are not always a sure path to success. The son of  
Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., lost a race in 1996 and the son of former 
Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala., failed two years later in a run for the 
House. Last month the widow of Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., was 
defeated in a primary runoff for her late husband's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want it to be harder for you because of your father,''  
said Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn., who was only 26 when he 
captured his father's seat in 1996. He still is the youngest member 
of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ford said growing up around the halls of Congress gave him a  
``great advantage that I brought to the job. I say, be proud of it, 
don't run from it.''

<HEADLINE> Cleveland High School Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Authorities ordered a high school closed today  
after they uncovered an apparent plot by students to stage 
``violent acts'' there. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a published report today, several South High School  
students admitted planning an attack with guns and explosives, 
similar to the one carried out by two students at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo., last April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking about a plan to disrupt the school with violent  
acts,'' Mayor Michael R. White said Thursday night at a news 
conference at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	A South High student learned of the plot Wednesday morning and  
alerted her parents. One of the parents notified the school, The 
Plain Dealer reported today, citing a source close to the 
investigation. The school has 1,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, some students dressed in black got the attention of  
school security officers. They were questioned about the rumored 
attack and were sent home with parents, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	At Columbine, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 13  
people and wounded 23 others at the school on April 20 before 
killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	South High's homecoming game and dance scheduled for tonight  
were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and school security checked the high school locker by  
locker Thursday night for weapons and explosive devices, White 
said. None were found. 
</P>
<P>
	But White said some ``documents'' that were found Thursday  
appear to be evidence of a planned attack. He refused to specify 
what those documents were. Eleven students at the school face 
possible disciplinary action, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer reported that some students gave written  
statements to police. The statements said they planned to use guns, 
which were to be obtained from a gang, and homemade explosives to 
kill teachers, administrators and fellow students, the newspaper 
said. It was unclear whether the students had already obtained any 
weapons, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the statements, the massacre was planned for just  
before noon today, with students opening fire in the school 
cafeterias and the principal's office. The students planned to 
conclude with a suicidal shootout with police in a courtyard, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a matter that is literally unfolding minute to  
minute,'' White said. ``We have an obligation to only communicate 
what we know to be true and to keep the conjecture and rumors at 
bay until we know what is going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the investigation, security at all 120 schools in  
the 77,000-student district was being increased today. 
</P>
<P>
	South High School is to reopen Monday with additional security  
officers and hand-held metal detectors to scan students before they 
enter, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Softens Approach on IOC Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) --The chief adviser on U.S. drug policy turned  
conciliatory Friday and said there was a role for the IOC in 
creating an international agency to combat drugs in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barry McCaffrey repeated his opposition to a ``unilateral''  
solution from the International Olympic Committee. He earlier 
derided the IOC proposal as ``crazy,'' but was less combative in 
this round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you'll find that there will be a dialogue in the  
coming weeks and that there will be a solution and that the IOC's 
role can be strengthened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey was wrapping up a six-day trip to four European  
countries to discuss drug control. 
</P>
<P>
	``I also see nothing wrong with the IOC being the ones who draft  
the documents and I don't see anything wrong with the IOC 
maintaining a relationship with this process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said the European Union and European governments are  
not encouraged by the IOC's drug agency plan. The United States 
backs an alternative international agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey noted the U.S. Olympic Committee had agreed to start  
an independent agency for American athletes, which he termed ``a 
useful model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC plans to set up its agency as a Swiss foundation Nov.  
10, with the appointment of a board of directors. The IOC says the 
agency will be operating by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey says such an agency would lack independence and  
accountability. The United States wants a fully independent agency 
with tests on a year-round, no-notice basis. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey's comments came as the IOC faces an important test  
this weekend in Switzerland in completing reforms driven by the 
Olympic bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch could be pressed to push  
through key recommendations, especially those calling for an age 
limit of 70 and a ban on members' visiting Olympic bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many IOC members say they don't want to enact  
reforms just to appease congressional critics in Washington.

<HEADLINE> INS Crows About Reducing Backlog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The immigration service trumpeted its  
reduction in the mountain of citizenship applications awaiting 
review, saying average paperwork processing times of more than two 
years have been whittled to 12 months and are headed lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Seizing on a rare bit of good news for the embattled Immigration  
and Naturalization Service, Attorney General Janet Reno and INS 
Commissioner Doris Meissner announced Thursday that the agency had 
processed 1.25 million citizenship applications in the fiscal year 
ended Sept. 30 -- double the 610,547 handled a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with Meissner at a news conference, Reno pronounced  
herself ``very pleased and very proud'' that INS had met its goal 
of processing 1.2 million applications during the 1999 fiscal year, 
and in the process slashed wait times from the 28-month national 
average of a year ago to a 12-month average now. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the immigration service still has a backlog of 1.36  
million citizenship applications, Meissner pledged to reduce 
waiting times even more by next fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in a very solid position to meet this coming year's goal  
of reducing that national average to just six months,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	While welcoming the progress, the chairman of the House  
Judiciary Committee's immigration panel took issue with INS' 
calculations, saying the national average wait time never exceeded 
14 months even if some individual offices had waits of 28 months or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration's claim to have cut in half the waits for  
citizenship applicants is a gross misrepresentation,'' said Rep. 
Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a persistent INS critic. 
</P>
<P>
	INS managers stood by their figures.  
</P>
<P>
	The agency's traditional supporters on Capitol Hill praised the  
trimmed wait times, but said INS still has much to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would urge the INS to not spend too much time or energy  
slapping itself on the back,'' said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., 
chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus' immigration task 
force. The agency still must deal with the backlog of 1.36 million 
applications, which Gutierrez termed ``intolerable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reno and Meissner stressed that the speedier processing hasn't  
weakened the citizenship system's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1995 effort to deal with the backlog caused the INS endless  
grief after it was learned that sloppy procedures allowed tens of 
thousands of ineligible foreigners -- including thousands with 
criminal pasts -- to gain citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
	Besieged with criticism from Capitol Hill -- where Republicans  
accused the Clinton administration of seeking to grant citizenship 
before the 1996 presidential election to a group of people viewed 
as friendly to Democrats -- INS revamped its citizenship program and 
added new safeguards. ``We have very, very strict quality controls 
in place,'' Meissner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The service's naturalization struggles and accomplishments came  
during an explosion in citizenship applications, Meissner noted. 
From 1993 to 1999, 6.4 million people applied for citizenship, more 
than in the previous 37 years combined, she said.

<HEADLINE> EU Officials Pledge Kosovo Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- European Union officials visiting  
Kosovo promised Western aid to rebuild the ravaged province and 
help get its people through the rough winter. 
</P>
<P>
	They also urged the province's ethnic Albanian leaders to stop  
their political infighting and work together to build a society 
based on ethnic tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	Javier Solana, the EU's foreign policy and security chief, and  
Chris Patten, the EU's external affairs commissioner, got a 
firsthand taste of the reconstruction problems facing Kosovo. As 
they walked into a press conference in Pristina, the capital, the 
electric power failed. The province frequently suffers power 
outages. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO officials cranked up a generator which powered only one  
small light and the sound system. The press conference proceeded in 
near darkness, with reporters shouting, ``back here'' as the two 
peered through the shadows looking for the questioners. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU has earmarked a half billion dollars for Kosovo next  
year, mostly for long-term reconstruction, said Patten, formerly 
Britain's governor of Hong Kong. He said the EU had already 
provided $500 million, mostly for humanitarian aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The advent of winter has added new urgency to reconstruction  
efforts. According to the EU, more than 300,000 people here face 
winter without adequate shelter because so many homes were 
destroyed during the 18-month Yugoslav crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
	An EU task force plans to ship building materials to Kosovo in  
hopes of restoring at least 3,500 of the most heavily damaged homes 
in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana, who served as NATO secretary-general during the 78-day  
NATO bombing campaign, said the EU is anxious for the province's 
ethnic Albanian leadership to set aside personal differences and 
work together. 
</P>
<P>
	Solana and Patten spoke after meeting with moderate ethnic  
Albanian politician Ibrahim Rugova, twice-elected president of a 
Kosovo government that Yugoslavia never recognized. Rugova's chief 
rival for the mantle of Kosovo leadership is Hashim Thaci, 
political leader of the officially disbanded Kosovo Liberation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes we get the impression that there's too much  
infighting among the leaders of the Kosovo community and we figure 
there should be a more coordinated effort to get the common goals 
achieved,'' Solana said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Pristina on Friday, the new chief prosecutor of the  
international war crimes tribunal urged Yugoslav authorities to 
grant investigators access to Serb victims and witnesses. 
Yugoslavia has consistently refused cooperation with the court 
since it was established. 
</P>
<P>
	The major difficulty facing war crimes investigators ``is our  
inability to gain access to Serb witness and victims, many of whom 
are now in Serbia,'' said Carla del Ponte, the tribunal's new chief 
prosecutor in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal currently has about 400 forensic experts from 15  
nations working in Kosovo. So far, only Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic and four of his allies have been indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Del Ponte warned today that additional charges could be filed  
against Milosevic, including genocide charges.

<HEADLINE> Benes, Olerud Are Free Agents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Andy Benes terminated his contract with Arizona  
and became a free agent, and John Olerud and Kenny Rogers were 
among three New York Mets who filed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Benes and the Diamondbacks agreed in February 1998 to an $18  
million, three-year contract that paid him $6 million per season, 
but the deal gave him the right to end it after two years and he 
informed the Diamondbacks late Thursday he was opting out. 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old right-hander was 13-12 with a 4.81 ERA on a  
staff that included Randy Johnson, Omar Daal, Armando Reynoso, 
Brian Anderson and Todd Stottlemyre, who was injured for much of 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Olerud has been with the Mets for three seasons and was coming  
off an $8 million, two-year deal. The 31-year-old first baseman hit 
.298 with 19 homers and 96 RBIs, and may be wooed by new Seattle 
general manager Pat Gillick, the GM in Toronto when Olerud played 
for the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillick phoned Olerud's parents earlier this week, before he  
became a free agent, and the commissioner's office is investigating 
whether that contact broke anti-tampering rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, who pitched a perfect game for Texas against California  
on July 28, 1994, walked in the winning run last week in the sixth 
and final game of the NL Championship Series, giving Atlanta a 
10-9, 10-inning win over the New York Mets and a 4-2 series win. 
</P>
<P>
	Shawon Dunston, another player obtained by the Mets just before  
the July 31 trade deadline, also was among the 29 players who filed 
Friday, raising the total to 49 among the approximately 140 
potentially eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta third baseman Chipper Jones, one of the stars of the  
Braves' pennant run, learned Friday that the team was exercising a 
$4.75 million option for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Eric Plunk's $1.8 million option was declined by  
the Milwaukee Brewers, who must pay a $150,000 buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs declined a $7 million option on infielder Jeff  
Blauser and a $3.5 million option on catcher Benito Santiago. 
Blauser, who hit .240 with nine homers and 26 RBIs, gets a $200,000 
buyout. 
</P>
<P>
	Also filing Friday were Cincinnati left-hander Steve Avery, who  
declined a $3 million mutual option in favor of a $1 million 
buyout, Reds right-hander Juan Guzman, St. Louis left-hander Darren 
Oliver, Pittsburgh third baseman Ed Sprague and Toronto left-hander 
Graeme Lloyd. 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd was sent to Toronto by the Yankees in February along with  
David Wells and Homer Bush for Roger Clemens. New York may attempt 
to bring him back by signing him as a free agent.

<P>
	An approaching storm system brought pounding surf to  
California's central coast and light rain to the Pacific Northwest 
this morning. High winds gusted in parts of the Rocky Mountains and 
Wyoming, hampering visibility. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, conditions in the central and eastern United States  
were tranquil, with partly or mostly clear skies. 
</P>
<P>
	The western storm left two dead on Thursday while making 15-foot  
swells, destroying boats and tearing down docks. An approaching low 
pressure system was expected to bring more severe surf to the West 
later today, along with rain and snow across the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong system is expected to linger over the Rockies long  
enough to bring up to a foot of snow before moving from the 
northwestern Plains and eastern Rocky Mountains into the western 
and central Plains, bringing the possibility of rain and 
thunderstorms. Some storms may bring hail and gusty winds. 
</P>
<P>
	High pressure centered over the mid-Atlantic states was forecast  
to bring a pleasant day to the East, with dry, sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecast highs for Friday called for 40s and 50s in the  
Northwest; mainly 50s, 60s and 70s across the West; 50s and 60s 
across the Great Lakes, New England, northern and central Plains; 
70s and 80s across the lower Ohio Valley, Southeast, Southwest and 
Mid-Atlantic states.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Cyclone Batters India Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BHUBANESWAR, India (AP) -- The second deadly cyclone in two weeks  
hit India's densely populated east coast Friday, knocking down 
thousands of homes, trees, electric poles and telephone lines with 
its 155 mph winds. 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were killed when a wall collapsed in Orissa state. At  
least 30 people were injured in neighboring Midnapore district in 
West Bengal state when their homes collapsed, Press Trust of India 
news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many more were feared dead or injured, but little was known  
about many areas since most telephone lines were cut. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 50,000 people were evacuated from coastal villages,  
Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani told parliament in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee placed the military on alert  
to provide help when the storm subsides. Vajpayee's Cabinet will 
meet Saturday to assess the damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Air force helicopters plan to drop food to the affected areas  
Saturday and relief workers on the ground also plan to distribute 
food, vaccine and polyethylene sheets to the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Called a super cyclone because of its intensity, the storm  
turned the sky inky black and drove 15-foot waves ashore. Such 
powerful storms are rare in the Bay of Bengal, said L.K. Chand, of 
the meteorological office in Bhubaneswar. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm swept across an area inhabited by nearly 10 million  
people. ``You cannot imagine the devastation. The deaths will be 
not in tens, but in hundreds,'' United News of India news agency 
quoted Girdhar Gamang, the top elected official of Orissa state, as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclone ripped into the port town of Paradwip and later hit  
Bhubaneswar, the state capital 55 miles from the coast, hammering 
the city with winds of 110 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly 150,000 huts have been devastated and almost every tree  
uprooted,'' said Padhi. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20,000 people were evacuated from coastal villages, said  
D.N. Padhi, the relief commissioner of the state of Orissa. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities crammed villagers into trucks during the night and  
evacuated them hours before the cyclone hit land. Residents were 
evacuated to schools and public buildings to ride out the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The state was still recovering from an Oct. 17 storm that killed  
more than 100 people and injured more than 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The government canceled trains traveling to and from the area  
Friday, fearing the wind would blow carriages off their tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 200 fishermen who went to sea before the storm were  
listed as missing. Another 4,000 fishermen were caught in heavy 
seas but were in radio contact, United News of India reported. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the Bay of Bengal, authorities in  
Bangladesh scaled down their storm warning, but an evacuation alert 
remained in effect and warnings were issued to fishermen to stay 
close to port.

<HEADLINE> Skiing Has Team Competition Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TIGNES, France (AP) -- The International Ski Federation announced  
plans Friday to launch a new team competition, despite an 
increasingly glutted calendar. 
</P>
<P>
	FIS president Gian-Franco Kasper, speaking at the annual  
congress at the season-opening giant slalom races this weekend, 
unveiled the plans for the competition, which would begin at the 
end of the 2001 season and offer up to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not part of the World Cup,'' Kasper said. ``At least  
not in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Television is extremely interested and our results show that a  
team competition is wanted and would be a success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the project is still in the planning stages, FIS said the  
top eight countries from the World Cup would qualify for the event 
along with the host nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Four skiers from each country -- two men and two women -- would  
compete in each discipline and accumulate points for their country. 
</P>
<P>
	The competition would be staged at the end of the season but  
would not conflict with national championships, FIS director Sarah 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to encroach on the national competitions,''  
Lewis said. ``But the fact is in April the Alps still have a lot to 
offer.''

<HEADLINE> Toshiba To Settle Laptop Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Toshiba Corp. is settling a class-action lawsuit  
that had alleged there were defects in its laptop computers 
potentially involving 5 million of the machines shipped to the 
United States since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiba, the leader in the U.S. laptop computer market with  
about a 15 percent market share, said today it did not admit 
liability or acknowledge the possibility of a problems in agreeing 
to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The company did not disclose terms of the settlement, but said  
it expects it will cost about $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The electronics concern said it risked an even greater loss of  
up to $9.5 billion if the case had gone to trial. It also wanted to 
protect its brand image, Toshiba said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This solution is a bitter pill for us to swallow,'' Toshiba  
President Taizo Nishimuro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement has been approved by those who filed the suit but  
requires approval by the U.S. District Court in Beaumont, Texas, 
where the lawsuit was filed. That is not expected until February, 
Toshiba spokeswoman Midori Suzuki said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese electronics maker revised its earnings forecast for  
the fiscal year ending March 31. It now expects a group loss of 
$476 million -- more than triple its earlier prediction of a $143 
million loss. It hopes to offset some of the costs of the 
settlement with selling securities holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in March by two U.S. users of Toshiba  
personal computers as a class-action lawsuit that potentially 
applies to all those who own the 5 million Toshiba portables. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit alleges that the floppy-disk drive controllers in  
Toshiba's laptop computers are faulty, distorting or losing 
information written onto disks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5 million laptops affected by the settlement represent  
nearly all Toshiba laptops shipped to the United States since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it was bound by an agreement with the  
plaintiffs not to disclose the terms of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	But it said as part of the settlement, Toshiba will start  
incorporating on Nov. 8 new floppy disk controllers in personal 
computers for sale in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers with a valid warranty on laptops bought after February  
1998 can return their computer for some sort of refund. 
Alternatively, they can download software or get new hardware and 
accept coupons worth $200 or $225 depending on the option they 
choose to fix the potential problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of the refund depends on the total number of people  
who claim one, Suzuki said. Details on where consumers can seek 
refunds have not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers with computers still under warranty but purchased before  
March 1998 are only eligible for the coupons. Those whose warranty 
has expired are only entitled to $100 coupons. The coupons are for 
Toshiba computer products. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiba also agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to the  
plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The refunds and coupons won't apply to the same Toshiba models  
sold in Japan and elsewhere, but software to correct any possible 
problems will be available on the Toshiba Web page for downloading 
starting next month, Suzuki said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, Toshiba's share price lost 6.15  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Toshiba said it was slashing its work force by about  
5,000 workers, or nearly 8 percent, because of dismal earnings 
prospects.

<HEADLINE> Bush Knowingly Courts Women Voters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the days after Elizabeth Dole's withdrawal  
from the Republican presidential race, George W. Bush's support 
jumped 13 points among women who plan to vote in GOP primaries and 
caucuses. Among all women, a traditional source of Democratic 
strength, he has lost ground to Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats say Bush's strategy to attract women is a threat,  
even though they believe they have a better track record on women's 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans have a candidate who uniquely understands  
targeting the women's vote,'' said Celinda Lake, who specializes in 
the women's vote and informally advises the Gore campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	His campaign slogan of compassionate conservatism goes over well  
with suburban white women, also known as ``soccer moms,'' Lake 
said. ``He's careful on the choice (abortion) issue, aggressive on 
the education issue, he's careful with the diversity of his team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican pollster Linda Divall, who worked with the Dole  
campaign, says both Dole and Bush fare well among women because 
``voters see a different type of Republican face ... not the dour, 
scolding, intolerant, hard-edged, rigid voice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll said Bush's support among  
Republican-leaning women, 55 percent before Dole dropped out Oct. 
20, jumped to 68 percent after her departure. Bush's overall 
support increased by 6 percentage points, even though his support 
among men likely to vote in the Republican race -- now 67 percent -- 
remained about the same. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitted against Gore, the two candidates were in a virtual tie  
among women. Previously, Bush had a slight lead. Then -- and now -- 
the Texas governor's lead over Bill Bradley, the other Democratic 
hopeful, was 13 points among women. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last two presidential elections, Bill Clinton fared well  
with women voters, leading by 8 percentage points in 1992 and twice 
that margin in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic nominee will need a big advantage among women if  
Bush retains his current lead of almost 20 percentage points among 
men. Now that Dole is gone, no other GOP candidate has shown a 
particularly strong appeal with women so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Longtime Democrat Krista O'Connor of Williamsport, Pa., said the  
Clinton-Gore administration ``compromised the institution of the 
presidency'' with the impeachment scandal. She liked Bush's message 
about education, personal responsibility and strong families, and 
that he didn't seem as harshly conservative as House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the crucial jobs for Democrats in the 2000 presidential  
election is to make certain that Ms. O'Connor's change of heart is 
more the exception than the rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People  
&AMP; the Press, said, ``It's pretty evident that women haven't 
responded in the positive way to Gore that they've responded to his 
boss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say the key to countering Bush is to make sure women  
are aware of his support for a concealed weapons law, private 
accounts for Social Security, school vouchers, and his opposition 
on abortion -- an issue he talks around. 
</P>
<P>
	The trick for the GOP, said Bush pollster Fred Steeper, is to  
keep its strong appeal for men while attracting more women. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP recruiters say the Bush campaign, with its emphasis on  
education, compassion and inclusion has been a far easier sell to 
women this year than in many past elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like night and day,'' said Lezlee Westine, general  
counsel for Technet, a political organization representing 
executives. ``George W. Bush cares about the issues important to 
women. He shows that he understands their lives and has an 
inclusive message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a New York Democrat who is co-chair of  
the House women's caucus, said Democrats have a big advantage in 
appointments of women to key positions and on issues like 
reproductive freedom, support of public schools and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has proven his ability to draw women voters, getting 49  
percent in his first gubernatorial race -- against a woman, 
incumbent Democratic Gov. Ann Richards, and more than 60 percent 
when he ran for re-election in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	His spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker, said his leadership style is  
``not strident, he unifies, he works across partisan lines to 
accomplish results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Democratic Chairwoman Molly Beth Malcolm, a former  
Republican, counters: ``I believe that American women are smarter 
than buying into a pretty gift-wrapped package with nothing 
inside.''

<HEADLINE> Africa Trade Bill Fails in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation backed by the Clinton  
administration to expand trade with Africa became the latest victim 
of partisan bickering in the Senate on Friday. But Senate leaders 
later pledged a last-ditch effort to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican-led chamber rejected, 46-45, an effort by  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., to bring a weeklong debate on 
the bill to a conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the bill has wide bipartisan support, Democrats were  
united in protesting what they viewed as Lott's strong-arm tactics 
in seeking to prevent them from offering certain amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote could doom the measure for the year, just a day after  
President Clinton stood beside Nigeria's president at a White House 
news conference and renewed his call for its passage. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday, however, Lott told the Senate he would try again  
next week. He began negotiations with Democrats expected to extend 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott made one key concession, offering to permit a Senate vote  
on a proposal on the minimum wage in exchange for Democratic 
support for moving to a quick vote on the trade bill. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested the minimum wage amendment -- Democrats are seeking  
to raise the hourly rate $1 from the present $5.15 -- could be 
debated on a bankruptcy overhaul bill next week, instead of on the 
Africa trade bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said there still was no deal, and much remained to be  
worked out. But they said there was at least a chance the trade 
measure could be revived. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which has been passed twice by the House, would  
eliminate most tariffs and quotas on products from the 48 nations 
of sub-Saharan Africa. It would also encourage U.S. investment in 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate sponsors plan to modify it to also include Caribbean and  
Central American nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition came mainly from textile-state senators, who  
contended the bill would hurt the U.S. garment industry; and from 
some labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., the leading opponent, protested  
that the U.S. textile industry has been beaten down by foreign 
competition to one-third its previous size. 
</P>
<P>
	In a succession of Senate speeches, Hollings repeatedly  
criticized a strong lobbying effort for the bill by Fruit of the 
Loom Inc., a big contributor to Republican causes; and its 
chairman, William Farley. 
</P>
<P>
	Like other companies with factories in the Caribbean, Fruit of  
the Loom would benefit from the proposed Senate provision allowing 
apparel produced there to enter the United States duty free, so 
long as it was made from U.S. fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollings called the legislation the ``Fruit of the Loom Job  
Flight'' bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Finance Committee,  
suggested 80 senators supported the basic legislation. ``It is 
unfortunate that a bill with such strong bipartisan support was 
blocked for reasons unrelated to the substance of the 
legislation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the minimum wage squabble, there are other  
contentious amendments pending. 
</P>
<P>
	One would restore the president's expired ``fast track''  
authority to negotiate trade agreements. Another would permit food 
and medicine sales to Cuba and other countries under U.S. 
sanctions. Still another would place a moratorium on mergers and 
acquisitions among large agribusinesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., prime sponsor of the agribusiness  
amendment, threatened to use procedural devices to ``try to block 
all legislation for the remainder of the year'' if he can't get a 
vote on his measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's vote came on a so-called cloture motion by Lott, a  
device for limiting Senate debate and choking off filibusters. It 
requires 60 votes and Lott only mustered 45. No Democrats voted for 
his motion. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing couldn't have been worse in terms of U.S. efforts to  
build closer ties with Africa. It came even as Nigeria's president, 
Olusegun Obasanjo, was in Washington and shortly after Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright returned from an Africa trip. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of African ambassadors to the United States watched  
stern-faced from the Senate gallery as the vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, each side accused the other of partisan politics.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have put in jeopardy the trade policies of the last  
two-thirds of the century,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were quick to suggest it was Democrats who were  
being isolationist this time -- not Republicans, as Clinton had 
charged when the Senate rejected a global nuclear test-ban treaty 
two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was one of the shortest-lived definitions of  
isolationism,'' said Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., a sponsor. 
``President Clinton could not deliver a single member of his 
party.''

<HEADLINE> Cavs Want '12th Man' vs. Seminoles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Score first and get the crowd  
involved early. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the hope of Virginia defensive back Antwan Harris in  
looking ahead to the Cavaliers' game against top-ranked Florida 
State Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``A touchdown first would be nice,'' Harris said ``I think that  
would help the defense out a lot because then we would have 
something to defend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Florida State (8-0, 6-0 ACC), battling another off-the-field  
distraction following the arrest of cornerback Tay Cody on drug 
charges, might be more accommodating than usual. The Seminoles 
haven't scored a first-half touchdown in two straight games, 
unimpressive victories against Wake Forest and Clemson. 
</P>
<P>
	The way Harris sees it, an early touchdown would not only boost  
the confidence of Virginia's inconsistent offense, but also spur 
the home crowd to make noise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need this crowd to help us in this game because if the  
crowd is all dead and not saying anything, wearing suits and stuff, 
we'll be like, `What the heck?' '' Harris said. ``They might as 
well stay home because they're not going to help us. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need them to come with the meanest face that they have,  
come in the gate looking mad as heck and ready to scream on every 
play that Florida State's offense is out there. If they do that, I 
think they can help us a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia (4-3, 3-2) surely needs the help. With four games  
remaining -- and No. 7 Georgia Tech next on the schedule -- the 
Cavaliers need to win one of the next two to have a shot at 13 
straight seasons with at least seven victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three other schools, including Florida State, have 12 in a  
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the Seminoles struggle against Clemson while enjoying a  
weekend off let the Cavaliers know that Florida State is not 
invincible. It also gave the team a chance to take stock of its 
season before the stretch drive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave everybody a chance to sit back and look at what has  
gone good and what has gone bad and reflect on that,'' said 
tailback Thomas Jones, the ACC rushing leader who can break some 
school records with another big game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones needs 81 yards to break Tiki Barber's career record of  
3,389 rushing yards, and is only 289 yards shy of breaking Barber's 
single-season mark of 1,397 yards, set in 1995. That also was the 
year Virginia beat the Seminoles 33-28, the first loss for Florida 
State after joining the league in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us to win, I have to have a good game,'' Jones said. ``In  
games like this, I definitely have to step up my play, make more 
plays than usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Virginia won in 1995, Barber was huge. He rushed for 193  
yards on 31 carries, caught three passes for 45 yards and returned 
six punts for 73 yards. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive back Dwayne Stukes, who watched from the sidelines as  
a freshman in that game, sees the game as a chance to salvage a 
disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, I never thought we'd be 4-3, so this game is  
even more important as a chance to prove to people that we are a 
talented team,'' he said. ``Right now they're thinking that we're 
the team that lost to Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seminoles coach Bobby Bowden has found little relief this week  
from the strain of getting beyond his 300th victory last week 
against Clemson and son Tommy Bowden, or from the resolution of 
Peter Warrick's legal troubles in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Cody was arrested Tuesday for possession of  
marijuana, causing Bowden to suspend him for Saturday's game and 
maybe longer.

<HEADLINE>  GOP Hopefuls Debate in N.H. Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                         *By WALTER R. MEARS 	
</P>
<P>
                      *AP Special Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Next time, Gov. George W. Bush's rivals for  
the Republican presidential nomination will be debating against him 
instead of about him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Governor Bush will be very active in this campaign,  
particularly since we're moving up so rapidly in the polls,'' said 
Sen. John McCain, who trails Bush but is gaining. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said he'd have preferred to have Bush participate in the  
forum at Dartmouth College Thursday night because New Hampshire 
voters deserved it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator, publisher Steve Forbes, conservative  
activist Gary Bauer, commentator Alan Keyes and Sen. Orrin Hatch of 
Utah went ahead without Bush, meeting for the second time in a week 
in a 60-minute question-and-answer format. 
</P>
<P>
	They sparred at times, but it was no slugfest as they stated  
their positions on taxes, abortion and assorted other issues, 
without much argument. It was not direct debate. They got questions 
in turn, 90 seconds to answer, no rebuttal time. 
</P>
<P>
	In the New Hampshire polls, McCain trails Bush by 12 to 16  
points. The others are far behind, registering in single digits. 
McCain said he does not discount them, recalling that he was down 
there, too, not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But he says he is gaining traction, and he sought to add to it  
Thursday night by sticking to his message of reform, a point he 
made on almost every question put to him. He said patients' medical 
rights, school voucher funding, money to meet the needs of military 
families, and his standard, political finances, are all in need of 
reform that can't happen until the power of special interest money 
is curbed. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain continued today to press the case for campaign finance  
overhaul, a topic that drew several questions from a crowd of 100 
people attending an early morning town hall meeting in Walpole. 
``This is an incumbency protection racket that keeps incumbents in 
office, but until I draw my last breath I will fight for the 
issue,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes took the hardest shot of the night at Bush for his  
absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps in the future, at a forum like this, if we call it a  
fund-raiser he might show up,'' said the magazine heir, who is 
financing his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush already has said he will come to the Republicans' debate in  
Manchester, N.H., on Dec. 2. And the absentee got a solo interview 
on WMUR-TV, a local station, two hours before the hourlong debate 
it co-sponsored with CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he regretted missing it, but preferred to be at a  
ceremony honoring his wife, Laura, at Southern Methodist University 
in Dallas. ``I'm sorry I'm not there, I look forward to the 
debates, I've got a lot to say,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've got a lot of work to do, I take nothing for  
granted,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only a front-runner would get that TV treatment. But it also  
showed that Bush is wary of the absentee argument against him. His 
campaign issued statements explaining his absence. He had planned 
to stay out of debates until January. 
</P>
<P>
	Bauer did take a slap at Forbes on another point, saying that  
his proposed flat tax would favor corporations over families. 
``Gary, you're wrong,'' Forbes countered. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain urged Republican openness to differences on the abortion  
issue, repeating that he is firmly opposed to the practice. None of 
the more conservative candidates challenged him on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have respectful disagreements on specific issues, and  
we can work together on this one,'' he said of the party's most 
divisive social policy dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley,  
the Democratic candidates, met in their first question-and-answer 
debate Wednesday night. When the moderator at the GOP forum asked 
who in that crowd had watched the Democrats, McCain's hand was one 
of those that went up. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said the Democratic contest might have a bearing on his,  
because about one-third of New Hampshire voters are independents 
and can vote in either party primary on Feb. 1. So independents 
could be pivotal. ``Senator Bradley is appealing to a lot of 
independents,'' he said before the debate. ``I am, too.''

<HEADLINE> Big Waves in Pacific Kill Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Waves up to 25 feet pounded the West Coast,  
killing at least two people, including a bride swept to sea at 
Lover's Point as her husband took photos during their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Eamon Stookesberry, 28, of Concord, dove in after his  
23-year-old wife, Jennifer, but couldn't reach her. Rescuers, on 
the scene within minutes, pulled them both from the water near 
Pacific Grove, just outside Monterey and 85 miles south of San 
Francisco. Mrs. Stookesberry was pronounced dead in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	The couple had married Saturday and were on the last day of  
their honeymoon, the groom's brother, Jude Stookesberry, said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Eamon Stookesberry is a house painter; his wife worked in a  
hospital and planned to become a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to run from it, but it got them,'' said A.J. Young,  
who was watching and immediately called 911 on his cell phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed was a 20-year-old surfer, Danny Jordan, near Santa  
Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have 20-foot swells and 25-foot waves, we have  
vicious rip tides,'' said Owen Miller, a Capitola Fire Department 
battalion chief. ``It sounds like he was knocked around pretty 
heavily by incoming waves and wasn't able to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swirling storm, 600 to 800 miles in diameter, sat off the  
coast for at least a day before moving toward land Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The waves hit the coasts of Washington and Oregon before dawn  
then worked south, slamming the coast near Capitola in early 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Feared lost was an unidentified man last seen Wednesday on a  
40-foot sailboat that lost a mast in high seas and heavy winds 
about 560 miles off the Pacific Coast. Two Coast Guard vessels, one 
equipped with a helicopter, were expected to reach the scene by 
Saturday to continue the search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had no information on where the sailboat had  
originated or how many people may be on board, said Petty Officer 
Veronica Bandrowsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful waves, which reached 40 feet in parts of Northern  
California, lured spectators to the shores. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not just surf,'' said Santa Cruz harbor port director  
Brian Foss. ``This was a surge, a huge pulse in the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It destroyed boats and forced driftwood onto the streets of  
Monterey. Water, mud and seaweed covered famous 17-Mile Drive in 
Pebble Beach. The ocean topped the Capitola sea wall, forcing 
wharf, restaurant and hotel evacuations.

<HEADLINE>  Falun Gong Protests Intensify </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- As police tackled them and dragged away at least  
one by the hair, members of Falun Gong stepped up their campaign of 
defiance today, petitioning Chinese leaders to end an intensifying 
crackdown on their banned spiritual movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams of plainclothes and uniformed police rushed about  
Tiananmen Square today, attempting to put a stop to five days of 
protests that until today had been largely quiet and peaceful. At 
least 50 people were taken from the vast square, some of them 
shouting at police as they were wrestled to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Police set upon a handful of university-age Falun Gong  
practitioners as they took out a letter beseeching the communist 
government for tolerance. Officers twisted one youth's arm, forcing 
him to double over, chased down another fleeing across the street 
and grabbed the hair of a third, pulling him into a clutch of 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	The renewed confrontations proved how undaunted Falun Gong  
followers remain despite a three-month ban on the once widely 
popular group and a fresh wave of repression ordered by the 
communist government. 
</P>
<P>
	Spreading a dragnet across Beijing, police have arrested at  
least 3,000 group members this week from every part of China except 
Tibet, a Communist Party source said on condition of anonymity. A 
directive issued Wednesday night, he said, ordered tightened 
security at government buildings, airports, railroad and bus 
stations in all major cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong members had seeped into the capital in recent weeks  
on word that the government was preparing fresh measures to subdue 
recalcitrant followers. On the run as members of an outlawed group, 
they have slept in homes of sympathizers, at construction sites or 
any other place they can find. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been forced to sleep on the streets, under bridges,  
along avenues, passageways, with the possibility of arrest at any 
time,'' said Qu Dehong, who with his wife and 11-year-old son, left 
their Jidong county home in the chilly northeast for Beijing nearly 
six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``People sleeping on the streets is only the tip of it,'' said  
Yang Chunguang, a 28-year-old clothes merchant from the 
northeastern provincial capital of Changchun. Too poor to buy 
bottled water, some are drinking out of toilets, using plastic 
containers found in the trash, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Binding them together are a firm conviction in Falun Gong -- a  
blend of slow-motion exercises and Buddhist and Taoist ideas 
believed to promote health and morality -- and the tools of modern 
communications. Some carry mobile phones and pagers. They use the 
Internet to keep in touch with members in the United States, 
Australia and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Through e-mail and mobile phones, believers in recent days have  
tried to counter the police action by contacting foreign reporters, 
discarding an earlier reluctance to use the Western media. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know nothing good will come of being videotaped by foreign  
journalists. But we must do it to explain our teachings,'' said 
Yang. ``We are waiting for a fair airing of our views by the 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders, frightened by Falun Gong's popularity and flair  
for secretive organization, banned the group in July. Since then, 
thousands of rank-and-file members have been detained and forced to 
recant their beliefs. Dozens of organizers are believed in jail 
awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese leaders this week initiated a new five-step campaign to  
eradicate the group by early next year, the Communist Party source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	As the first step, the party newspaper People's Daily ran a  
stinging front-page diatribe officially branding the group ``an 
evil cult'' instead of just an illegal organization. At a weeklong 
session, senior legislators prepared a law that would lengthen 
prison sentences for members and organizers of cults. 
</P>
<P>
	After its expected adoption Sunday, courts throughout the  
country will be told to use the new law in trials against leading 
members, the party member said. He added that once the ringleaders 
are put away, investigators will turn to secondary members. 
</P>
<P>
	One organizer, Xu Xinmu, could go on trial as early as next week  
in Shijiazhuang city for ``revealing state secrets'' by passing on 
information on the crackdown to other members, a Hong Kong-based 
human rights group reported. Officials at the city's Qiaoxi 
district court said they knew nothing about the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Hong Kong today, about 60 Falun Gong practitioners gave  
the city's government a letter demanding that Beijing stop 
vilifying the group. Falun Gong is not banned in largely autonomous 
Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	The Falun Gong members want Hong Kong to pass the letter to the  
Chinese leadership. A spokeswoman for Hong Kong Chief Executive 
Tung Chee-hwa said it will be relayed to Beijing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns of Y2K Problems Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some members of the official American  
community in Russia are being authorized to return to the United 
States before Jan. 1 because of concern over potential Y2K-related 
disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Russia, the State Department said Friday it was  
giving authorization for certain categories of Americans to leave 
Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel warnings covering all four countries expressed concern  
about ``potential disruptions in energy supplies that may impact 
the health and safety of U.S. citizens residing or traveling'' in 
these countries if computers misread the year 2000 as 1900. 
</P>
<P>
	Those given the green light to leave include eligible family  
members and personnel deemed non-essential. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement said U.S. citizens should consider deferring  
travel to these countries until the extent of Y2K-related 
disruptions becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Americans who would be eligible to depart Russia  
and the other countries was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prolonged disruptions in energy supplies in Russia could put  
other systems dependent on electrical power at risk,'' the 
announcement said. ``In practical terms, this could mean disruption 
of basic human services such as heat, water, telephone and other 
vital services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar language was used in the warnings for Belarus and  
Moldova. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning on Ukraine said voluntary departure of eligible  
Americans was being authorized even though a U.S. government-funded 
study indicated a low risk of major disruptions to heat and 
electrical service in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the warnings said U.S. embassies and consulates abroad  
do not have facilities to provide private American citizens 
overseas with food, water, fuel, medicines, shelter or other 
equipment in the event of disruption of essential services. 
</P>
<P>
	The CIA has told Congress it is ``highly confident'' Y2K  
computer failures will not lead to the accidental launch of a 
ballistic missile by any country. 
</P>
<P>
	But it expressed some concern over the safety of aging  
Soviet-era nuclear power plants in Russia and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, Russian Deputy Security Chief Vladislav Sherstyuk  
said Russia will switch some crucial processes to manual control 
during the year 2000 changeover because it cannot afford to fix the 
Y2K bug on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Communications Committee, which is in charge of  
Russia's preparations for the changeover, said earlier that Russia 
also will reduce the number of airplane flights on Dec. 31 and halt 
some hazardous industrial processes. 
</P>
<P>
	For some time, the State Department has been preparing warnings  
for Americans living or traveling in 194 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, it warned that in China there ``may be a risk of  
potential disruption in the key sectors of banking and finance, 
telecommunications, medical services and in electrical power and 
infrastructure systems outside of the coastal cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the prevailing view among senior embassy diplomats in China  
is that Y2K problems will be minimal in Beijing and other major 
Chinese cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more confident that things here won't fall apart than  
people in Washington,'' one diplomat said. He added that the 
embassy recommendation is not to authorize voluntary departures.

<HEADLINE> Two Ark. Men Accused of Raping Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROGERS, Ark. (AP) -- Something so unspeakable is said to have  
taken place in Apartment 1207 that half the neighbors have moved 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	It was in 1207 that police say a 13-year-old boy was sexually  
brutalized and murdered last month by the two men who lived there. 
</P>
<P>
	According to police, Davis Carpenter Jr., 38, and Joshua Brown,  
22, drugged and blindfolded Jesse Dirkhising, gagged him with 
underwear and strapped him to a mattress face-down with duct tape 
and belts. Then the boy was repeatedly raped and sodomized with 
various objects before he suffocated because of the position he was 
in, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	At the apartment, police found handwritten instructions and a  
diagram of how to position the boy. Other notes described 
apparently unfulfilled fantasies of molesting other children. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a horrible, brutal crime,'' said prosecutor Brad  
Butler, who is seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Carpenter and Brown pleaded innocent to murder and rape and were  
jailed without bail for trial in April. Their lawyers 
unsuccessfully sought a gag order and have said little about their 
line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse lived with his family in a rural area 30 miles away. His  
grandmother told police that the seventh-grader had been going to 
the men's apartment on weekends for two or three months, presumably 
to go with Carpenter, a hair stylist, to work at the salon where 
Carpenter was employed. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Brown and the boy began a sexual relationship,  
according to Brown's statement to police. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegations are so shocking that half the tenants in the  
six-unit apartment building -- situated across the street from a 
park with baseball fields and tennis courts -- have moved out. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Watkins' house is near the apartment, and just a day  
before the arrests, she had been invited to bring her 10-year-old 
daughter's soccer team to the hair salon. Since Jesse's death Sept. 
26, her family has sought counseling and plans to move to the 
opposite side of this town of 34,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It scared my wife and daughter a whole lot, it just scared  
them to death,'' Tom Watkins said. ``My daughter, she was scared to 
sleep in her bedroom for a few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To neighbors, the two men appeared to be brothers. Carpenter was  
a neat freak, and Brown a friendly fellow who enjoyed playing the 
guitar. Neighbors said he worked at fast-food restaurants but was 
home most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never heard any noise, you never heard no wild parties, no  
craziness going on,'' said Connie Newcomb, who lives in the 
apartment next door and now looking to move out. She has two sons, 
10 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse's mother, Tina Yates, said Carpenter had been friends with  
her husband -- the boy's stepfather -- for about seven years. But 
Mrs. Yates said she would not say anything else about the case 
until after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesse's principal, Beverely Davenport, described him as outgoing  
with his peers; after his death, three girls claimed to have been 
his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was distant from teachers, Ms. Davenport said; he was  
repeating seventh grade because his studying ``lacked something to 
be desired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the night of Jesse's death, Brown repeatedly raped the boy  
while Carpenter watched, police said. Brown took a break to eat a 
sandwich, and soon noticed the boy had stopped breathing, according 
to the police account. Carpenter called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	When police arrived, they found numerous drugs. Jesse was  
pronounced dead at a hospital of what a coroner ruled was 
``positional asphyxia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to police, Carpenter said he had lived in 26 states.  
Police said background checks showed no convictions or warrants 
against either man.

<HEADLINE> Goodyear Blimp Crashes, Two Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUFFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- Goodyear's oldest blimp crashed into the  
woods a few miles from the company's air dock, slightly injuring 
both people aboard. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilot Gerald Hissem, 29, and technician Robert Peacock, 34,  
suffered minor cuts Thursday night, Goodyear spokesman Keith Price 
said. No one on the ground was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear why the blimp went down, Price said. State,  
federal and company authorities were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The 205-foot Spirit of Akron is the oldest of seven blimps  
promoting the Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. as the world's No. 1 tire 
maker. The $5 million blimp is based about 10 miles southeast of 
Akron. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodyear said the blimp, about 12 years old, passed an  
inspection the day before the crash, which happened as the crew was 
making a routine night sign flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The airship was traveling about 25 mph to 40 mph when a problem  
was discovered, said Scott Baughman, manager of North American 
airship operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Hissem released 150 gallons to 200 gallons of kerosene fuel and  
put the blimp into a controlled descent. The airship can hold about 
430 gallons but was only carrying about 200 on Thursday, Baughman 
said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Stumps for Candidate in Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- President Clinton urged Democrats today to  
turn out in strength at the polls next week in a close battle for 
control of city hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised Democratic mayoral candidate John Street  
as a ``vigorous, brilliant, committed public servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His heart is on fire for the children and the future of this  
city,'' Clinton said before a La Salle University crowd. ``He has 
all the experience in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Philadelphia's reputation as a heavily Democratic city,  
Street is running neck-and-neck in the polls with Republican rival 
Sam Katz. Clinton said Street's record as city council president 
proves he can balance budgets and keep the economy sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reward his record,'' the president said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's speech was interrupted by a handful of demonstrators  
protesting the Naval bombing exercises on Puerto Rico's Vieques 
Island. The group was eventually led from the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	During an interview with a Philadelphia radio show Tuesday,  
Clinton said the outcome of the mayor's race ``will have a big 
impact on national politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Street becomes the first Democrat to lose the mayor's race in  
a half century, it could influence next year's re-election race of 
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. It also could affect which political 
party carries Pennsylvania, a swing state in national elections, in 
next year's presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was warmed up by a hoarse Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Halloween night, it's trick or treat, and we're going to  
treat the people here in Philadelphia,'' Kennedy said. ``We're 
going to treat the people of Philadelphia with John Street.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Belief in Ghosts, Witches Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Is Halloween getting scarier? More people  
apparently believe in ghosts and witches than two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of the people surveyed in a new Gallup poll said they  
believe in ghosts, three times the number who said that two decades 
ago. One of five said they believe in witches, twice the rate of 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost nine of 10 people in the new poll said they have no  
objections to Halloween on religious grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	In medieval times, and in some countries today, the souls of the  
dead were thought to return to their homes on the eve of All 
Saints' Day -- or Halloween. Halloween customs were brought to this 
country by Irish immigrants in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
	The macabre and sometimes destructive trappings of Halloween  
have periodically raised concerns among church, school and 
government officials. They have led many to take children to 
supervised Halloween parties rather than letting them roam 
neighborhoods unsupervised to ask for candy. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of American parents in the poll said their children  
will go out trick-or-treating, slightly more than in 1978. More 
than four out of five parents say their children will wear costumes 
this Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular costumes for trick-or-treaters this year will  
be Batman, Star Wars characters, witches and Pokemon and Disney 
characters, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 1,005 adults taken Oct. 21-24 had an error  
margin of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> IRS To Go After Waiters' Tips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even if waiters and waitresses aren't  
reporting all their tips, the Internal Revenue Service says it will 
no longer audit restaurant owners as long as they do their best to 
comply with the tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the IRS is shifting its enforcement focus to the  
employees, even though officials acknowledge that will be far more 
difficult to track due to lack of money and manpower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like they are finally realizing they don't have any  
recourse,'' said Amanda Cholden, general manager of the Tortilla 
Coast restaurant on Capitol Hill. ``It's great, but in all honesty 
we do put forth a good-faith effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike, a bartender at a downtown pub and steakhouse who spoke  
only on condition his last name not be used, said the chances of 
getting caught will be slimmer with the new system but that most 
servers were fearful of cheating. 
</P>
<P>
	``This restaurant has 25 waiters. There is still going to be one  
guy checking the 25 waiters instead of just one proprietor,'' he 
said. ``You have to report it regardless, or you'll lose your 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS turnabout, which comes after years of court battles in  
which the agency fought to keep its restaurant audit powers, is the 
latest example of agency reforms that are geared toward helping 
taxpayers comply with the law rather than punishing those who 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas R. Burger, the IRS chief of employment taxes, said  
Thursday that ``there is something wrong'' when restaurant owners 
do everything they can to encourage waiters and waitresses to 
report tips but are still targeted by audits. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're doing everything they're supposed to do, we won't  
focus on the employer,'' Burger said. ``We think it's much more 
beneficial to us to educate at the beginning. You've got people out 
there who are trying. Where they are trying, they'll probably get a 
bye.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS figures it is losing billions of dollars a year in  
payroll and income taxes because of unreported restaurant and bar 
tips. In 1998, just over $7 billion in tips were reported -- tips 
over $20 a month must be disclosed -- in an industry that does some 
$250 billion in business a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not nickels and dimes,'' Burger said.  
</P>
<P>
	For years, the IRS locked horns in court with restaurants over  
the agency's practice of auditing the businesses instead of 
employees to collect underreported tips. Court decisions came down 
on both sides of the argument. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the IRS was promoting voluntary compliance  
through a program in which restaurants agree to advise workers of 
tip requirements, implement a way for them to report those tips and 
maintain records. In exchange, restaurants were less vulnerable to 
audits. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, restaurants could be kicked out of the IRS program  
and be subjected to audits if they complied with all the rules and 
their employees still failed to report tips. The new IRS move 
changes that, effectively immediately, and extends the voluntary 
program five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just makes sense that restaurateurs should not be  
vulnerable to being kicked off (the program) when they are 
complying with it, but their employees are not,'' said Steven C. 
Anderson, president of the National Restaurant Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The association has a sizable lobbying presence in Washington,  
spending $480,000 to lobby the federal government in the first half 
of 1999 and contributing $250,000 between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 to 
political campaigns, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS will still closely monitor restaurant tax filings to  
ensure the tips being reported are reasonable compared with its 
amount of business, Burger said. The average for credit card tips 
is about 14.5 percent, 12 percent for cash. 
</P>
<P>
	That means an establishment doing $1 million gross but reporting  
only 2 percent in tips ``very likely will get a contact from the 
IRS,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Financial Overhaul Bill Hits Snag </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sweeping legislation to overhaul the financial  
services laws hit snags in the final drafting stages Thursday in 
disputes over consumer privacy and community lending rules for 
banks, congressional officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would lift Depression-era barriers and allow  
banks, securities firms and insurance companies to merge and sell 
each other's products. It has vocal opponents, including liberal 
House Democrats, who are disturbed by provisions that would allow 
affiliated businesses of the newly merged companies to share 
customers' personal financial data as they offer one-stop shopping 
for loans, insurance and investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest dispute over privacy, however, is said to stem from  
efforts by some Republican lawmakers to weaken the bill's 
prohibition against affiliated financial companies sharing data 
with outside telemarketers, by adding new exemptions for some 
cases. The exemptions would include cases in which banks provided 
customer account data to telemarketers that was encrypted, or coded 
to prevent access by an outside party, said congressional aides, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate aides, lawmakers and administration officials  
have been drafting the legislation in marathon closed-door sessions 
in recent days, in hopes of putting the measure to a final vote by 
the full House and Senate this week. 
</P>
<P>
	With the White House having lifted its long-standing veto threat  
and now supporting it, the financial overhaul measure is being 
given the best chance ever of adoption after 20 years of 
congressional battles and intense lobbying by the financial 
services industries. 
</P>
<P>
	The process has been delayed, however, by the disagreements over  
privacy and community lending requirements for banks, which had 
earlier been ironed out in tentative accords. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Democrats' leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., told  
reporters Thursday that there is an ``argument'' among the 
legislative negotiators over the community lending rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of dispute over what was agreed to,'' Gephardt  
said. ``There's an argument over the language.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules, under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, require  
banks to make loans in low-income and minority areas in which they 
operate. They often have been criticized by Senate Banking 
Committee Chairman Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who managed to kill 
financial overhaul legislation last year over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	After negotiating into the wee hours a week ago, Republican  
lawmakers and top administration officials reached a compromise 
under which banks wishing to expand into other areas of financial 
activity must have a satisfactory rating from federal examiners on 
their community lending. 
</P>
<P>
	The accord, apparently called into question on Thursday, also  
included a demand from Gramm that community groups which receive 
money from the banks disclose how they spend it.

<P>
	MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Eric Plunk's $1.8 million option for next  
season was declined Friday by the Milwaukee Brewers, making him 
eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old right-hander, who gets a $150,000 buyout, was  
4-4 with a 5.02 ERA in 68 relief appearances for the Brewers this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Plunk was acquired from the Cleveland Indians in 1998 for  
pitcher Doug Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his best years was with the Indians in 1993, when he led  
the team with 70 appearances and 15 saves, both career highs. That

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore, Bradley Debate a Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Hampshire Democrats say Al Gore and Bill  
Bradley performed equally well in Wednesday night's debate, but 
more believe that the vice president has the best chance of 
defeating the Republican front-runner, George W. Bush, a poll said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by CNN-Gallup of 432 registered voters who say they're  
likely to vote in the state's Democratic primary showed Bradley and 
Gore in a statistical tie. Gore had the support of 48 percent and 
Bradley was at 46 percent. It also indicated that both have the 
same favorable ratings of 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also suggested that about four-out-of-10 who saw  
Wednesday night's town meeting thought the vice president did a 
better job -- about the same number that thought Bradley did a 
better job. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it came to who had the best chance of beating Bush, 51  
percent said Gore and 35 percent Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Other New Hampshire polls have suggested that Bradley would be  
more successful against Bush because of his appeal among 
independents and swing voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Public perceptions of the two candidates showed differing areas  
of strength. Gore was given higher marks for understanding the 
nation's problems and appearing presidential. Bradley was given 
more credit for having new ideas and not being a typical 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll taken on Thursday has an error margin of plus  
or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Man Confesses to 140 Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A 42-year-old man arrested in April has  
confessed to abducting and killing 140 children during a five-year 
nationwide spree, Colombia's chief prosecutor announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has no precedent in Colombia,'' chief prosecutor Alfonso  
Gomez Mendez told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	He identified the suspect as Luis Eduardo Garavito, who was  
shown in police mug shots to be a tall, dark-skinned man with 
mustache. 
</P>
<P>
	Garavito was arrested after an 18-month investigation into the  
disappearances of children in at least 11 Colombian states. The 
children's bodies were found with their throats slit and showing 
``signs of having been tied up and mutilated,'' the prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 114 bodies have been found thus far.  
</P>
<P>
	The victims were largely poor, many of them children of street  
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	Garavito passed himself off as ``a street vendor, monk,  
indigent, disabled person or representative of fictitious 
foundations for the elderly and child education, gaining entrance 
to schools as a speaker,'' Gomez added. 
</P>
<P>
	Until November, police had few clues into a rash of recent child  
disappearances. It was then that the remains of 36 boys ages eight 
through 16 were found in a ravine and an overgrown lot in the 
western city of Pereira, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
	That gruesome discovery prompted authorities to create a  
nationwide task force that began to encounter similarities between 
cases across the country, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	That effort turned up an arrest warrant for Garavito in a 1996  
homicide case of a child in the north-central city of Tunja. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his arrest in the eastern provincial city of  
Villavicencio, where he is currently being held, Garavito was 
living under an assumed name, prosecutor's said. 
</P>
<P>
	A search of the apartments of a girlfriend and another friend  
turned up newspaper clippings about cases of several of the 
disappeared children. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez said Garavito often gained a victim's confidence by  
offering money or a drink, then persuading them to go for a walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Garavito moved around the country frequently since the killings  
began in 1994, and also spent time in neighboring Ecuador, where 
investigations are under way to determine whether he might be 
linked to child slayings in the neighboring country, the prosecutor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The greatest number of killings took place in the state of  
Risaralda, of which Pereira is capital, where 41 bodies have been 
found, and in bordering Valle de Cauca, where another 27 turned up. 
</P>
<P>
	Gomez said Garavito was apparently abused himself as a child,  
and would undergo extensive psychological examinations.

	Investigators Visit No Gun Ri Scene  
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- U.S. investigators visited the scene  
today of an alleged mass killing of South Korean civilians by 
American soldiers in the early days of the Korean War. The eight 
U.S. investigators, led by the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. 
Michael Ackerman, interviewed survivors of the alleged killing. 
Their visit marked the first field investigation of the event in 
July 1950 at No Gun Ri, a hamlet in central South Korea. On Sept. 
30, The Associated Press reported accounts by American veterans and 
South Korean villagers that U.S. soldiers killed up to 400 
civilians at No Gun Ri.

	Russia Continues Chechen Attacks  
</P>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Russia unleashed a new wave of air and  
artillery strikes against militants in breakaway Chechnya today, 
underlining its rejection of Western calls for a peaceful solution. 
Jets continued bombing the capital, Grozny, and Chechnya's 
second-largest city, Gudermes, as well as several villages. Russian 
troops had Gudermes cut off from the north and east, but they 
believed there were still about 200 militants in the city, Defense 
Ministry spokesman Gennady Alyokhin said. Casualty figures were not 
available for the latest fighting. 

</P>
<P>
	Khatami Speaks at UNESCO Conference  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- In a much-anticipated speech today, Iran's moderate  
president called for dialogue to replace the sword in the next 
century if the world is to avert catastrophe. Security was 
extremely tight as Mohammad Khatami addressed the General 
Conference of the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization, with roads blocked and dozens of security vehicles, 
hundreds of policemen and some sniffer dogs in evidence. The UNESCO 
speech was seen as an opportunity for the Iranian leader to 
publicly define where his nation was headed, and hint at how far he 
could go in implementing his goal of dialogue rather than 
confrontation with the West.

	Jabs Taken At Bush in GOP Debate  
</P>
<P>
	HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- Most of the Republican presidential  
hopefuls participating in a debate last night stuck to the issues, 
but a few jabs were directed toward the absent front-runner, George 
W. Bush. ``Perhaps in the future at a forum like this if we call it 
a fund-raiser he might show up,'' candidate Steve Forbes said of 
the Texas governor, whom he accused of skipping campaign events to 
raise funds for his candidacy. Forbes was on the receiving end on 
another issue, when conservative activist Bauer said his flat tax 
proposal would let some corporations escape taxes ``while you (the 
taxpayers) are paying 25 percent between the income tax and the 
payroll tax.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Tape Heard in Death of Gay Student  
</P>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men accused of killing gay  
college student Matthew Shepard told police he repeatedly beat the 
victim after an unwelcome sexual advance on a night that began when 
Shepard asked for a ride home. In an hour-long jailhouse recording 
played for jurors yesterday, Aaron McKinney described how he and a 
friend didn't intend to hurt Shepard but rob him. But as the three 
were riding in a pickup truck, Shepard ``starts grabbing my leg and 
my genitals,'' McKinney told police. ``I don't do that stuff.'' 
Shepard, a 21-year-old University of Wyoming student, was left for 
18 hours on the freezing prairie, and died on Oct. 7, 1998. His 
death galvanized those seeking to expand the nation's hate-crime 
laws. The trial is to resume today. 

</P>
<P>
	Falun Gong Protests Intensify  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- As police tackled them and dragged away at least  
one by the hair, members of Falun Gong stepped up their campaign of 
defiance today, petitioning Chinese leaders to end an intensifying 
crackdown on their banned spiritual movement. Teams of plainclothes 
and uniformed police rushed about Tiananmen Square today, 
attempting to put a stop to five days of protests that until today 
had been largely quiet and peaceful. At least 50 people were taken 
from the vast square, some of them shouting at police as they were 
wrestled to the ground. Police set upon a handful of university-age 
Falun Gong practitioners as they took out a letter beseeching the 
communist government for tolerance.

	TOKYO (AP) -- The Nikkei closed at 17,942.08 points, up 528.37  
points, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today. In New York yesterday, 
the Dow industrials soared 227.64 to 10,622.53.

	Stewart, Crash Victims Remembered  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The skirl of a lone bagpipe playing the Scottish  
lament ``Going Home'' cut through ghostly fog in a chilling tribute 
to Payne Stewart before the start of the Tour Championship 
yesterday. With sullen faces and vacant eyes, Stewart's peers on 
the PGA Tour sat on white folding chairs on the first tee of 
Champions Golf Club to honor his memory at the tournament where he 
was to have played.

	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- The Tampa Bay Lightning claimed center Steve  
Martins off waivers from the Ottawa Senators on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martins, 27, played in a career-high 36 games with Ottawa last

</P>
<P>
	Martins played four seasons at Harvard before making his NHL  
debut in 1995-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Martins played parts of two seasons with the Hartford Whalers

<HEADLINE> Nebraska Congressman To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Rep. Bill Barrett said today he will retire  
next year at the end of his fifth term to spend more time with his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I weigh all the pros and cons of this job, I've decide  
that I'm at a point in my life where I'd rather start my day with 
'Good morning, Grandpa' instead of 'Good morning, Congressman,''' 
said the 70-year-old Barrett, who has four grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican, Barrett was first elected in 1990 to represent the  
3rd Congressional District, one of the largest districts in the 
nation spanning four-fifths of the state. He easily won re-election 
four times since. 
</P>
<P>
	As vice chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Barrett has  
been outspoken on farm issues and helped write the 1996 Freedom to 
Farm Act, which did away with farm subsidies through 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	He also worked to keep the federal government out of local water  
rights issues and backed efforts to balance the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud of that record, but after next year I'll be ready  
for a new challenge,'' Barrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before coming to Congress, he spent more than 10 years in the  
state Legislature.

<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Here's the concept: MTV's ``Real World''  
meets a Backstreet Boys-type singing group for a new TV show about 
the boys' struggles for fame and love. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenario sounded so tempting that ABC Entertainment decided  
to produce such a show in Orlando next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour series, tentatively titled ``O-town,'' will follow  
the making of a male singing group. TV cameras will document 
auditions, selection of the five band members, the songwriting 
process and preparation for a live performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will be guided by Trans Continental Records President  
Lou Pearlman, the boy band guru who has guided the Backstreet Boys 
and N'Sync to chart-topping fame. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV Productions will produce the show in association with

<HEADLINE> Gophers Know Damage Brees Can Do </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Big Ten's best defense gets its biggest  
test Saturday in Purdue quarterback Drew Brees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing, having watched him last year. I didn't know he  
could do all that,'' Minnesota safety Delvin Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Brees passed for 522 yards and six touchdowns in a  
56-21 victory over the Golden Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers have lost by a field goal to national powers  
Wisconsin and Ohio State at home in the last three weeks. But they 
know they're going to have to play Purdue much better than they did 
last year if they want to stay close to the 18th-ranked 
Boilermakers at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year? I think we can learn from it,'' Gophers defensive  
back Jack Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just the humbled defenders who learned their lesson,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was the worst game we've played since coach (Glen)  
Mason has been here,'' Minnesota running back Thomas Hamner said. 
``We've moved on and we've learned from it. We have to come out and 
set the tempo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers (5-2, 2-2 Big Ten) would be tied with Penn State  
atop the Big Ten with an inside shot at the Rose Bowl if not for 
their 23-20 overtime loss to Wisconsin Oct. 10 and their 20-17 
defeat against Ohio State last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, Minnesota squandered late leads and failed in the  
fourth quarter to put away a ranked opponent at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Michigan or Michigan State on their schedule this  
season, the Gophers had high hopes of not only posting their first 
winning season since 1990 and earning their first bowl bid since 
1986 but also of finishing in the Big Ten's upper echelon. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they've got difficult games against Purdue (5-3, 2-3) and  
Penn State before closing out the season with Indiana and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they do get a winning season and a bowl bid, they'll  
lament these lost chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose close games like that, it's usually what you do  
to yourself that's the difference,'' said Gophers quarterback Billy 
Cockerham, who threw an interception that was returned for a 
touchdown by the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Gophers face a team that nearly beat Penn State last  
week when Brees came within 12 yards of ending the Nittany Lions' 
undefeated season and maybe their national title hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees threw for 379 yards and two touchdowns. Three completions  
in the final minute brought the 18th-ranked Boilermakers from their 
30 to the Lions' 12. Out of timeouts, Brees attempted four passes, 
and each fell incomplete, giving No. 2 Penn State a 31-25 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees became the third quarterback in Purdue history with 600  
completions, passing Jim Everett and ending the game only seven 
short of second-place Scott Campbell's 609. Mark Herrmann holds the 
record of 772. 
</P>
<P>
	In 21 starts, Brees has thrown for 57 touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers don't need any reminders of how good Brees is,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brees is a great passer,'' Brewer said. ``He's the best in the  
Big Ten and one of the best in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not the best.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I haven't seen all of the quarterbacks,'' Mason said,  
``but I don't think there is a better quarterback in the country 
than Drew Brees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Karon Riley, the Big Ten's leading pass-rusher,  
knows what the Gophers are in for, even if they play well against 
Brees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to make big plays,'' Riley said. ``He didn't get to  
the level he's at by shying away from pressure. Hopefully, we can 
disrupt his rhythm.''

<HEADLINE> Golfer Payne Stewart Is Eulogized  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By DOUG FERGUSON    	
</P>
<P>
                           *AP Golf Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Paul Azinger pulled a tam o'shanter cap  
snugly over his head and rolled up his trousers to knickers-length, 
revealing a garish pair of argyle socks -- all part of a poignant 
tribute to his close friend, Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	On a table below the pulpit where Azinger offered his eulogy  
Friday, a gold chalice gleamed. The Ryder Cup rarely leaves its 
trophy case at the PGA of America headquarters, but there could be 
no better showcase. 
</P>
<P>
	In a gripping service at a church where Stewart finally found  
peace, he was remembered above all for his passion, for his wife 
and two children, for the three major championships he won, for the 
Ryder Cup team he would have captained and for the game that made 
him such an endearing figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart loved life,'' said Azinger, whose garb drew  
applause and laughter from the crowd. ``He was the life of every 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A party is what Tracey Stewart wanted for her 42-year-old  
husband, who was among six people killed on Monday when his Learjet 
flew uncontrolled across the country before crashing into a field 
in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	She remembered him as ``the most beautiful-looking man I'd ever  
seen'' when they first fell in love, and as a father who was a line 
judge at 13-year-old Chelsea's volleyball match, and who watched 
10-year-old Aaron catch a touchdown pass two days before the fatal 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	She was a big part of his career, too. She noticed his head  
moving over his putts in the third round of the U.S. Open. The next 
day, keeping that crucial tip in mind, he made three crucial putts 
on the final three holes to win the championship in spectacular 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will always be my soulmate and my best friend. We love  
you. Let the party in heaven begin,'' she told some 3,000 people 
attending the memorial at the First Baptist Church, causing many to 
crumple. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 PGA Tour players and officials were in attendance,  
including Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman, former PGA Tour commissioner 
Deane Beman, and former Ryder Cup captains Ben Crenshaw, Tom Kite 
and Lanny Wadkins. Also present was most of the field from the Tour 
Championship in Houston, including Tiger Woods, David Duval and 
Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
	When the two-hour service ended, they formed a line down both  
sides of the center aisle -- a protective wall for Mrs. Stewart to 
walk through. She held her head high and greeted them later at a 
private reception. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour shut down tournaments in Texas and Mississippi so  
players could honor Stewart. About 100 players were at the service, 
along with their wives and some caddies. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournaments will resume Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love the guy,'' Fred Couples said. ``It's so easy to say  
now. Looking around at all the people, it was a beautiful ceremony. 
I feel our hearts were lifted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was only one round of applause -- when Azinger, his close  
friend, reconfigured his outfit to look like Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``I figured it would take Payne Stewart to get me in a suit, but  
I never thought I would stoop to this,'' he joked. ``I felt 
pressure this morning knowing he would be watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The service included a song written this week by country singer  
Vince Gill and played on tape, Christian singer Michael W. Smith, 
and a video presentation that captured some of Stewart's 18 
victories and comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to a special place when I die,'' he said in one  
interview played on a big screen in the church. ``But I want to be 
sure my life is special while I'm here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Next to the Wanamaker Trophy for his PGA Championship victory in  
1989 and the U.S. Open trophy, which he won for the second time in 
June, was the prize that meant as much as any to Stewart -- the 
Ryder Cup, which the U.S. won last month after the greatest 
comeback in the 72-year history of the matches against Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart was a vicious competitor. He only played to  
win,'' Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger also paid tribute to Robert Fraley and Van Ardan, who  
also perished in the crash and were Stewart's agents as well as his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
	He concluded with a tearful ``Goodbye, Payne. We loved you and  
we miss you, but we know we will see you again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Displayed along with three of golf's most prized possessions  
were painful reminders of what Stewart's death leaves behind -- 
photos of his family on a rafting trip, and one picture taken just 
nine days ago with his son at the annual Father-Child tournament 
before the Disney Classic, Stewart's last event. 
</P>
<P>
	His children contributed a set of buck teeth, one of Stewart's  
favorite props in his role as practical joker. He once wore them on 
the driving range and told Mark O'Meara that he had walked into the 
path of someone's swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always enjoyed Payne. I never knew if he was kidding half  
the time,'' Nicklaus said after the service. ``He always had a 
needle out to jab, but he was having fun. He had fun when he played 
golf, and he had fun when he was serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chuck Cook, the teacher who helped fine-tune a relaxed, graceful  
swing that was nearly as recognizable as his knickers, also spoke 
at the service. 
</P>
<P>
	Cook recalled a trip to Pebble Beach before the U.S. Open in  
1992, where Stewart was the defending champion. They went out to 
the 18th hole late that night and sat on a retaining wall with the 
trophy between them. Waves lapped against the shore below as they 
talked for hours and sipped a bottle of Cristal champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open returns to Pebble Beach next year, without a  
defending champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``There won't be a U.S. Open trophy, but there will be a bottle  
of Cristal,'' Cook said of his plan to return. ``I'm going to go to 
the wall and talk to my friend about life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the European PGA Tour, players at the Volvo Masters in Jerez,  
Spain, paused for a moment on the 18th green to remember Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have been blessed by knowing and spending time with  
Payne,'' Bernhard Langer said. 
</P>
<P>
	For style alone, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem compared him  
earlier this week to Walter Hagen, ``a player who had this bigness, 
this presence about him, who dressed for the game, who brought 
excitement to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a substance to Stewart, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	He was perhaps the most successful player in the U.S. Open, the  
toughest championship in golf, during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won his first U.S. Open in 1991, beating Scott Simpson  
in an 18-hole playoff at Hazeltine in Minnesota, then again in June 
with his historic putt at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	There were failures, too. He finished two strokes behind Lee  
Janzen at Baltusrol in 1993, and lost a four-stroke lead to Janzen 
at The Olympic Club last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry about me, boys,'' Stewart said at the time. ``I'll  
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept his word.

<HEADLINE> AMA Unveils Health Info Web Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Seeking to give patients more reliable online  
health news and advice, the nation's leading physician groups are 
starting their own Internet site. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Medical Association and six other physician groups  
early next year will launch medem.com, an effort to combat fears 
that patients are getting inaccurate and misleading information 
online. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 writers and editors will provide daily health and  
medical research news. 
</P>
<P>
	The site is free for consumers, though doctors have to pay $70  
per month. Doctors can have their fee covered by a sponsoring 
company. No sponsors have been signed up yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers have flocked online as an easy way to obtain detailed  
information about diseases affecting them and their family. Doctors 
have complained about patient queries sparked by questionable 
material found on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Medem.com will offer the same news and information available  
online from sites such as drkoop.com and America Online's Health 
Channel, but the physician groups say their credibility gives them 
an advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Medem, based in San Francisco, also hopes to attract consumers  
by providing a direct link to Web sites of physicians who sign up 
for the service. Through the link, medem.com will provide patients 
a secure service so patients and physicians can communicate via 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Medem.com will give our patients access to information they  
can trust and information they can use with their physicians in 
order to improve their health care,'' said Dr. H. Dunbar Hoskins 
Jr., chairman of the Medem board of directors and executive vice 
president of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. ``We felt much 
of the information being delivered on the Internet was inaccurate 
and out of context.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the for-profit initiative will have trouble  
attracting consumers because of the unfamiliar name of medem.com, 
its relatively late arrival on the Internet scene and the AMA's 
close connection to doctors rather than patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are facing an enormous amount of competition online  
that's already gone down the learning curve to acquire and retain 
customers,'' said Claudine Singer, an Internet analyst with Jupiter 
Communications in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Other major health-related Web sites include Intellihealth.com,  
WebMD.com and healtheon.com, all of which have been available for 
more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with the AMA and the ophthalmology academy, the other  
groups participating are: the American Academy of Pediatrics; the 
American College of Allergy, Asthma &AMP; Immunology; the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists; the American 
Psychiatric Association; and the American Society of Plastic 
Surgeons.

<HEADLINE> W.Va. Mining Permit Ban on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday put on hold  
his ruling that the state cannot issue strip mining permits for 
projects that use stream beds to dispose of rock and dirt, a 
decision that critics said would hamper all mining in West 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Charles Haden II said the stay will remain  
in effect while the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals considers an 
appeal by the state Division of Environmental Protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Haden said that he delayed the implementation of his Oct. 20  
order even though the state agency failed to meet the necessary 
criteria for a stay because he wanted to quiet the uproar since his 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling so worried state officials that Gov. Cecil Underwood  
ordered a state hiring and spending freeze in preparation for what 
he said could be a statewide budget cut of as much as 10 percent 
because of a reduction in taxes from mining. 
</P>
<P>
	The law bans mining operations from dumping coal and dirt within  
100 feet of a stream. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could all but shut down mountaintop removal mining, a  
strip mining technique used increasingly in Appalachia. The top of 
a ridge is sheared off, the coal is extracted, and the leftover 
rock and dirt are pushed into a nearby river valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Coal industry leaders warned that the ruling could also cripple  
traditional underground mining, which also disposes of waste in 
river valleys. 
</P>
<P>
	Underwood and state environmental officials said the ruling  
affects existing permits, though Haden said this week that his 
ruling applied only to future permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Haden criticized state officials specifically for saying his  
ruling would cause economic havoc by shutting down strip mines and 
potentially stopping road building and other projects. 
</P>
<P>
	West Virginia is the No. 2 coal-producing state, behind Wyoming.  
The coal industry accounts for 3 percent of all jobs in West 
Virginia, down from 9.5 percent in 1979. The nearly 19,000 jobs 
tied to the industry provided more than $950 million in wages in 
1998, with workers averaging $50,800 a year.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Death Sentence Overturned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A panel of federal judges on Friday overturned  
the death sentence of a man who was the first person sentenced to 
execution by the United States under a 1988 federal drug law. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has not executed anyone in 36 years.  
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals  
ruled 2-1 that David Ronald Chandler of Piedmont, Ala., was not 
properly defended by his attorney during his sentencing phase. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler's conviction for arranging the slaying of an informant,  
however, still stands and the case was sent back to the lower court 
for resentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Doug Jones in Birmingham, Ala., had not decided  
whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler's trial attorney, Drew Redden, testified at an appeals  
hearing that he made ``very little'' effort to sway the jury to 
spare Chandler's life. Two judges wrote that the jury that 
sentenced him did not hear witnesses and evidence that showed a 
``more admirable'' side of Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was convicted in 1991 of operating a large marijuana  
ring in northeast Alabama and arranging the murder of Marlin 
Shuler, a member of his network who became a government informant. 
The man who killed Shuler is serving 25 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandler was the first person sentenced under the 1988 Anti-Drug  
Abuse Act, which allows the death penalty for killings associated 
with a criminal enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	His execution has been on hold since last year, when the court  
agreed to hear his appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The last federal execution was 36 years ago, when Victor Feguer  
was hanged in Iowa for kidnapping and killing a doctor.

<HEADLINE> WHO Wraps Up Anti-Tobacco Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Health experts from more than 100 countries  
wrapped up preliminary talks on an anti-tobacco treaty Friday, 
saying they were on course toward a plan to cut smoking and stem a 
rising death toll. 
</P>
<P>
	The weeklong meeting sponsored by the World Health Organization  
ended with consensus that a future treaty should ban or restrict 
tobacco advertising and promotion, tackle smuggling, and use 
pricing and taxation to deter consumers, delegates said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government representatives -- including from big tobacco-growing  
nations -- also indicated they might be willing to try to cut 
supply, said Margaret Chan, a Chinese expert who co-chaired the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	WHO estimates that smoking kills 4 million people a year, and  
that the toll may rise to 10 million a year by 2030 because of the 
increase in tobacco use in developing countries like China. That 
would exceed the total death total from malaria, major childhood 
diseases and tuberculosis combined. The agency also estimates that 
between 82,000 and 99,000 young people around the world start 
smoking each day. 
</P>
<P>
	WHO Director-General Gro Harlem Brundtland has made the  
anti-smoking campaign one of the U.N. health agency's top 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates will meet again in March for more technical  
discussions on the convention before real political negotiations 
start in May. The aim is to have a global accord ready for signing 
in 2003, although WHO officials say the going will get tougher once 
governments involve economic and agricultural representatives 
rather than just health officials. 
</P>
<P>
	WHO is keeping tobacco companies at arms length, but says it  
they will likely be involved in national consultations about the 
planned convention. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-governmental anti-smoking campaigners said they were  
generally encouraged by the progress at the Geneva meeting despite 
their initial fears that tobacco growers and the United States and 
Japan -- home to big tobacco multinationals -- might seek to water 
down the provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``During this five-day meeting, almost 50,000 people have died  
from tobacco-related disease,'' said Judith Glanz of the Campaign 
for Tobacco Free Kids in Washington. ``Governments must take swift 
action to put a stop to this epidemic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-smoking activists erected an oversized ``Death Clock''  
outside the meeting room, logging one tobacco-related death every 
eight seconds.

<HEADLINE> Auto Racing Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASCAR has approved Ford's 2000 Taurus for competition following  
an exhaustive testing program in the wind tunnel and on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're really relieved,'' said Jay Novak, Winston Cup program  
manager for Ford Racing Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taurus, the first four-door model ever to run full time in  
NASCAR's top stock car series, debuted at the 1998 Daytona 500 and 
has racked up 28 victories in 65 races. 
</P>
<P>
	The new Taurus, to be used by Ford teams beginning with the  
Daytona 500 in February, looks more like the car being sold to the 
public than the 1999 version, Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the changes NASCAR asked for were minor, but that the  
process took longer than expected because it was being done during 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a huge undertaking,'' Novak said.  
</P>
<P>
	The 2000 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which is also considered a  
somewhat radical departure from the current model, is in testing 
and awaiting final approval from NASCAR. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Chevy teams have been griping about what they  
consider a Ford and Pontiac aerodynamic advantage this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Fords and Pontiacs took the top seven spots at last Sunday's  
race in Rockingham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having a Chevrolet was like bringing a .22 and the rest of  
them have got 9 millimeters,'' said Sterling Marlin, who was eighth 
in a Monte Carlo. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like the Pontiacs and Fords have got so much  
downforce they can overcome a slick track like Rockingham, and 
we've got to be perfect. Next year might be a different story. 
Maybe Chevrolet will be on a level playing field next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Dodge, it will introduce a new Intrepid for the 2001  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chevrolets are way down on downforce to both the other  
manufacturers,'' said Steve Hmiel, team manager for Steve Park's 
Chevy team. ``My biggest concern is, how good is that damn Dodge 
going to be?'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	BIG BUCKS: Dale Jarrett has been leading the Winston Cup points  
since May 15, and with a 246-point lead and only three races 
remaining, he looks like a shoo-in for his first series title and 
the accompanying $2 million payoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, though, he's got at least one other big change ahead  
-- a $120,000 bonus if he wins on Nov. 7 in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	The Winston Cup Leader Bonus goes to the driver leading the  
series when he wins a race. It builds at $10,000 a race until it is 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett won $60,000 for his victory in May in Richmond, where he  
took the series lead. Then he won another $30,000 when he took the 
checkered flag in the Brickyard 400 in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Jarrett has gone 11 races without a victory.  
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	LOOKING AHEAD: Mark Martin is scheduled for spinal fusion  
surgery on Nov. 22, the morning after the season finale in Atlanta. 
Yet he's already planning his comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to really, really focus on Daytona and go to  
Daytona and run good -- I mean, run good,'' said Martin, who is in 
nearly constant pain and can do little more physically than lift a 
few weights and drive his race car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably going to get someone to do my (offseason) test at  
Daytona and probably Talladega as well. The first time I'll climb 
in the car is, I think, February 10th when practice starts at 
Daytona.''

<HEADLINE> Poll: Gore, Bradley Debate a Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- New Hampshire Democrats say Al Gore and Bill  
Bradley performed equally well in Wednesday night's debate, but 
more believe that the vice president has the best chance of 
defeating the Republican front-runner, George W. Bush, a poll said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll by CNN-Gallup of 432 registered voters who say they're  
likely to vote in the state's Democratic primary showed Bradley and 
Gore in a statistical tie. Bradley had the support of 48 percent 
and Gore was at 46 percent. It also indicated that both have the 
same favorable ratings of 75 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll also suggested that about four-out-of-10 who saw  
Wednesday night's town meeting thought the vice president did a 
better job -- about the same number that thought Bradley did a 
better job. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it came to who had the best chance of beating Bush, 51  
percent said Gore and 35 percent Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	Other New Hampshire polls have suggested that Bradley would be  
more successful against Bush because of his appeal among 
independents and swing voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Public perceptions of the two candidates showed differing areas  
of strength. Gore was given higher marks for understanding the 
nation's problems and appearing presidential. Bradley was given 
more credit for having new ideas and not being a typical 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll taken on Thursday has an error margin of plus  
or minus 5 percentage points.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Wes Berggren, a guitarist and pianist for the  
psychedelic rock group Tripping Daisy, was found dead in his 
apartment Wednesday. He was 28. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are awaiting the results of toxicology tests to  
determine the cause of death. Police said foul play was not 
suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	Tripping Daisy blossomed onto the pop charts in 1995 with ``I  
Got a Girl,'' a quirky single that propelled the group's second 
album, ``I Am an Elastic Firecracker,'' to sales of nearly 300,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the band's third album, ``Jesus Hits Like the Atom  
Bomb,'' were sluggish, though. Island Records dropped them in 1998 
as part of its merger between Universal and PolyGram Records.

<P>
	AUDUBON, N.J. (AP) -- Peter F. Finley, a longtime newspaper  
columnist and award-winning reporter whose career spanned three 
decades, died Wednesday from complications from a brain tumor. He 
was 75. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, Finley scooped his colleagues when he cornered  
then-Gov. Richard Hughes in a restaurant men's room and landed an 
exclusive interview about yet-to-be announced plans for a summit 
between President Lyndon Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin 
at the former Glassboro State College. 
</P>
<P>
	Finley received a national spot news award for his story on the  
summit. His other press awards include an award from the 
Philadelphia Press Association for ``Best Human Interest Story'' in 
1970, a best writer award from the Philadelphia Press Association 
in 1978 and New Jersey Press Association awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Before retiring in the early '80s, Finley was a reporter and  
columnist at the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill for 30 years. He was 
known for his armchair columns about day-to-day life. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, five sons and two daughters, 13  
grandchildren; a brother; and two sisters.

</P>
<P>
	An autopsy will determine the cause of death.  
</P>
<P>
	He started at The Press-Enterprise on Nov. 3, 1980, and covered  
stories ranging from health issues to government and the homeless. 
He last worked as night general assignment reporter.

                            *James Velez    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- James Velez, who became the focus of an  
ambitious effort to attain an independent life for a disabled 
person, died Wednesday from an infection of the blood and spine. He 
was 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Velez's illness caused him to scratch himself so tenaciously  
that he ripped open his skin. The disease was not understood, in 
part because he was considered to be of average intelligence and 
was aware of the damage he was inflicting. 
</P>
<P>
	Institutionalized from the age of 7, Velez increasingly longed  
for a more normal life. In 1994, Job Path, a social service agency, 
began efforts to help him. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency succeeded in 1996, gaining his release and moving  
Velez into his own apartment. The improvement of Velez's life, 
documented in articles in The New York Times, drove others to ask 
for similar assistance for disabled children.

<HEADLINE> Hideo Nomo Spurns Phillies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It didn't take Hideo Nomo long to decide he  
didn't want to pitch for the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, who was asleep in Tokyo when the Phillies claimed him on  
waivers, awoke Friday and rejected the waiver claim, becoming a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia claimed Nomo Thursday after the Milwaukee Brewers  
waived him, but contract talks didn't get far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discussed our team and had a brief discussion about a  
multiyear deal,'' Phillies general manager Ed Wade said. ``Both 
Nomura and Nomo liked our lineup, but they felt free agency would 
be their best route at this time. They would like the opportunity 
to test the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, who has struggled to regain the brilliant form he  
possessed as a phenom with the Los Angeles Dodgers, rejected 
Milwaukee's contract offers for about $5 million a season. His 
agent, Don Nomura, wouldn't confirm reports that he was seeking a 
$27 million, three-year deal for the 31-year-old right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura also said the Phillies didn't contact him before claiming  
Nomo -- not unheard of, but curious in that the Phillies' $30 
million payroll wasn't likely to accommodate Nomo's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was unlikely to pay Nomo more than star pitcher Curt  
Schilling, who will make $5.65 million in 2000, the final season of 
a $15.45 million, three-year contract that contains a $6.5 million 
team option for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year with the Dodgers, signed  
with the Brewers for $250,000 five months ago. The New York Mets 
cut him in spring training, and he made three minor league starts 
for the Chicago Cubs with a 1-1 record and a 3.71 ERA. Nomo didn't 
look sharp in subsequent tryouts with Milwaukee and Cleveland, but 
the pitching-poor Brewers signed him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies considered signing Nomo last year, and could have  
gotten him at a discount because of his struggles. Instead, Nomo 
became one of the majors' biggest bargains for the Brewers, winning 
six of his first seven decisions and nine of his first 11. He 
finished 12-8 with a 4.54 ERA in 28 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo has a 61-49 career record with a 3.82 ERA and 1,031  
strikeouts in 960 2-3 innings.

<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp., trying to boost its  
position in a fast-growing market, is buying Entropic, a maker of 
software that lets people use their voice to interact with their 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the acquisition were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	Entropic, based in Washington, D.C., makes speech-recognition  
software and tools for developing software. Microsoft said the 
purchase will help its effort to promote talking as an alternative 
to typing or moving a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft plans to close Entropic's main office and relocate  
workers to Cambridge, England or to Microsoft's headquarters in 
Redmond. Microsoft has a research lab at Cambridge University.

<HEADLINE> China Rounds Up Falun Gong Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Stung by five days of defiant displays by a  
banned spiritual movement, China's communist government displayed 
rougher tactics Friday in its campaign to stamp out the Falun Gong, 
hauling away at least 50 followers. 
</P>
<P>
	As teams of police rushed to round up Falun Gong members, a few  
college-age followers abandoned four days of quiet vigils and 
daringly unveiled a petition in Tiananmen Square asking Chinese 
leaders for tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was fleeting. Police twisted one youth's arm,  
crumpling him, and dragged another by the hair into a clutch of 
officers. A third was tackled while trying to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	The detentions Friday added to the 3,000 people a Communist  
Party source said have been detained in Beijing this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The harsh tactics were part of a campaign of police sweeps and  
new anti-cult regulations aimed at vanquishing the movement, the 
party source said on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The new measures underscore the Communist Party's growing  
frustration with rank-and-file Falun Gong believers and the party's 
slipping hold on Chinese society. 
</P>
<P>
	The struggle, at heart, is a battle for the loyalty of China's  
people. Chinese leaders began moving against the widely popular 
group after 10,000 members staged a surprise, highly organized 
protest outside party headquarters April 25. Organizers taken to 
meet Premier Zhu Rongji insisted they, not the Communists, held the 
answer to China's social ills. 
</P>
<P>
	Protesters taken from the square this week told police and party  
officials they only want China's leaders to understand Falun Gong 
and the benefits its meditation exercises and philosophy bring to 
health and morality, the party source said. 
</P>
<P>
	``One suggested: 'Tell President Jiang (Zemin) to try it for  
three months. If his health improves, the central authorities 
should rescind the ban. If not, let it stand,''' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yang Chunguang, a 28-year-old clothes merchant from the  
northeastern industrial city of Changchun, has slipped in and out 
of Tiananmen Square this week, spending the night in safe houses in 
and around Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are waiting for a fair airing of our views by the  
government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who have traveled to the capital have slept at  
construction sites or other places in the increasingly cold late 
autumn weather. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been forced to sleep on the streets, under bridges,  
along avenues, passageways, with the possibility of arrest at any 
time,'' said Qu Dehong. He, his wife and 11-year-old son, 
practitioners all, left their home in Jidong county in the far 
northeast for Beijing nearly six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	To stop the influx, police have searched Beijing and watch  
airports and railroad and bus stations in other major cities. 
Provincial governments have sent police vans to Tiananmen Square so 
that captured followers can be taken to detention centers in their 
home provinces, witnesses and the party source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police threatened homeowners found renting rooms to group  
members, state-run Beijing Television reported Friday. Footage 
showed three groups of followers being led away. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside United Nations headquarters in New York, about 100 Falun  
Gong demonstrators called on U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to 
intervene and defend the group's rights. They also said they had 
reports that Chinese authorities were torturing Falun Gong members 
arrested in China and called for talks with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Already this week, the party's flagship newspaper, People's  
Daily, officially branded Falun Gong an ``evil cult,'' replacing 
its former designation as an illegal group. Legislators reviewed a 
new law, expected to be adopted Sunday, lengthening prison terms 
for members of Falun Gong and other groups deemed cults. 
</P>
<P>
	That law was specifically drafted to hand out heftier  
punishments to group leaders, the party source said. The source 
said that in the coming weeks authorities planned to give judges 
and prosecutors guidance for applying the new law and will instruct 
police and investigators to widen the crackdown against followers 
who refuse to recant. Up to 50 principal members of the group also 
were expected to go on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	But by remaining at large and defying the police threat with  
continued protests, Falun Gong members have shown a resilience and 
a flair for secretive organization. With mobile phones, pagers and 
the Internet, they have kept in touch with each other and devotees 
in the United States, Australia and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``As followers of the Great Way of Falun we are obligated to  
stand up and tell the leaders how good our Great Way is,'' Yang 
said. ``If they can accept it or not, that's their problem.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Cautious on Mideast Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is approaching talks next  
week with the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians with limited 
expectations and muted support from Egypt and Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Arab countries, already at peace with Israel, are not  
sending their heads of state or government to Oslo, where Clinton 
will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian 
leader Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be in the Norwegian capital to pay tribute to Yitzhak  
Rabin, the Israeli prime minister who was assassinated four years 
ago, and to Norway, which quietly arranged for negotiations between 
Israel and the Palestinians, succeeding where the United States had 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks have paid off for Arafat in gaining control of Gaza  
and part of the West Bank, where he intends to set up a state with 
its capital in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who has publicly declared his support for Palestinian  
``aspirations,'' said at a news conference Thursday that he did not 
want to raise expectations for his Oslo talks ``excessively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will meet with the two leaders separately Monday afternoon  
and then with them together on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential aides are ruling out any repetition of the marathon  
mediation Clinton conducted last October at the Wye Conference 
Center on the Eastern Shore of Maryland to produce an agreement in 
which Israel gave up some of the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Current negotiations are more ambitious. Out of them Arafat  
hopes to get a state, virtually all of the West Bank and part of 
Jerusalem, while Barak seeks to put to rest the conflict with the 
Palestinians that began with establishment of Israel more than 50 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior U.S. official ruled out any chance Clinton could get  
the issues resolved before flying home Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	While the 1993 Oslo accords anticipated a step-by-step approach  
to peace in the Middle East, and Rabin said it would be too much to 
expect the Israeli people to digest simultaneous pullbacks on the 
Palestinian and Syrian fronts, Barak has set his sights on a 
settlement by next September. 
</P>
<P>
	The immediate goal is a framework for an accord by mid-February.  
</P>
<P>
	The Syrian track remains cold, however, and the official,  
speaking on condition of anonymity, said with Syrian diplomats not 
on hand in Oslo there was not much Clinton could do on the short 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	But the president intends ``to keep the process going,'' the  
official said of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe both the leaders want to make peace. I believe  
they're committed to it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Middle East peacemaking also figured prominently at the State  
Department Thursday as Mauritania, an Arab country in North Africa, 
established diplomatic relations with Israel over widespread Arab 
objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a sovereign decision, taken by us as a sovereign  
state,'' Foreign Minister Ahmed Ould sid Ahmed said. ``We hope that 
this decision will foster efforts to arrive at a solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The northwest African nation is only the third Arab country to  
have full relations with Israel. The two others are Egypt and 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cairo, Syria's ambassador to the Arab League, Issa Darwish,  
said ``it's an unparalleled precedent in Arab relations ... and a 
violation of the 1996 Arab summit resolutions'' that reject the 
normalization of relations with Israel unless major progress is 
made in the Mideast peace process. The comments were carried by 
Egypt's Middle East News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the 22-member Arab League, Esmat Abdel-Meguid, said  
Thursday it ``is a move that doesn't come at the right time 
concerning the Arab cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinian ambassador to the league, Mohammed Sobeih, said  
Mauritania's decision ``strongly shocked the Arabs and led to a 
feeling of sorrow and sadness among Arabs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the capital, Nouakchott, the U.S. Embassy advised American  
citizens there may be demonstrations throughout the country aimed 
at the government and possible U.S. citizens and interests.	   ``These demonstrations have the potential to turn violent and 
may be located on and near university and high school campuses,'' 
the announcement said. ``U.S. citizens are advised to be 
particularly vigilant, to avoid crowds, political rallies and 
street demonstrations.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Negotiates Africa Trade Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Backers of a bill to expand trade with Africa  
are trying to salvage the measure from a major Senate setback. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not give up on this bill, a bill that has the support  
of 80 senators,'' said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the 
Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations were to continue over the weekend on ways to bring  
the bill to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite wide bipartisan support for the measure, the bill on  
Friday became the latest victim of partisan bickering in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., accused Democrats of trying  
to laden the bill with pet causes unrelated to trade, including a 
$1 hourly increase in the $5.15 minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats accused Lott of trying to strong-arm them and prevent  
them from offering such amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Lott failed by 15 votes to win the 60 votes he  
needed on a procedural motion to end debate on the legislation and 
limit amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, that would spell death for the measure.  
</P>
<P>
	But later in the day, Lott told the Senate he would try again  
next week and began negotiating with Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott made one key concession -- offering to permit a Senate vote  
on the minimum wage amendment on another bill, one due up next week 
that would overhaul bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they still had some concerns, but suggested there  
was a chance of a deal that could revive the Africa bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed twice by the House, would eliminate most  
tariffs and quotas on products from the 48 nations of sub-Saharan 
Africa. It also would encourage U.S. investment in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate sponsors plan to modify it to include Caribbean and  
Central American nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition has come mainly from textile-state senators, who  
contend it would hurt the U.S. garment industry, and from some 
labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the minimum wage squabble, there are other  
contentious amendments pending. 
</P>
<P>
	One would restore President Clinton's expired ``fast track''  
authority to negotiate trade agreements. Another would permit food 
and medicine sales to Cuba and other countries under U.S. 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still another, by Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., would place a  
moratorium on mergers and acquisitions among large agribusinesses, 
activities that he said are squeezing out the family farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Wellstone threatened to use procedural devices to ``try to block  
all legislation for the remainder of the year'' if he can't get a 
vote on his measure. 
</P>
<P>
	The chief House sponsor of the legislation, Rep. Charles Rangel,  
D-N.Y., called the Senate setback ``a delay, not a defeat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A large majority of the Senate wants to pass this  
legislation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gore Lectured by Labor Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Pressured by a union leader grudgingly  
in his camp, Vice President Al Gore promised tougher 
trade-bargaining tactics but warned Friday of times when ``we'll 
agree to disagree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said his labor record is better than rival Bill Bradley's  
and insisted that despite occasional differences he's a partisan 
for organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this in my bones,'' Gore said. ``I think you know  
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's appearance before about 250 activists at a regional  
meeting of the United Auto Workers Union underscored his complex 
relationship with a crucial Democratic constituency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters and the UAW dissented when the AFL-CIO endorsed  
Gore this month. Their leaders said delaying the endorsement would 
give labor greater leverage with the two rivals for the 2000 
Democratic presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The UAW criticizes the Clinton administration for trade policies  
it argues encourages business to ship jobs overseas and exploit 
child labor. Union leaders also argue that Clinton has been timid 
on issues like universal health care and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Korman, a regional director for the union, introduced Gore  
by ticking off a string of businesses that have moved operations 
overseas since the North American Free Trade Agreement was 
negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could give you example after example,'' he said. ``Free  
trade agreements like NAFTA have cost hundreds of thousands of 
American jobs and eroded workers' bargaining positions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore sat next to Korman staring intently and occasionally  
nodding. After finishing his list of complaints, Korman said he was 
backing Gore in his fight with Bradley, a former senator from New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	In his speech, Gore drew repeated standing ovations when  
speaking of issues where he agrees with labor such as banning 
businesses from hiring permanent replacements for striking workers. 
He also agreed that environmental and worker protections should be 
a more central part of trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Gore insisted that as president he would follow a  
free-trade policy, which he conceded would cause occasional 
tensions with labor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe that trade should lift up living standards and not  
drag them down,'' said Gore. ``I am of the view that increased 
flows of trade increase markets and improve living standards here 
in the United States. Even if sometimes it does cost jobs, it 
creates more jobs to replace them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore told the union activists he built a solid record on labor  
even though he's from a Southern state, Tennessee, where that isn't 
always popular. ``I've got a higher (labor) rating than my 
opponent, who comes from a state that is heavily unionized,'' the 
vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Internal disagreements within the UAW have made the union's  
relationship with Gore even more complex. While the national UAW 
has withheld its endorsement, the political arm of the Iowa 
affiliate has backed Gore and drew a rebuke from higher up. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement represents an important organizing tool in the  
state where precinct caucuses launch the nominating season next 
January. Activists said Iowa union leaders concluded that delaying 
an endorsement would leave the union on the sidelines in caucuses 
just three months away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got caucuses coming,'' said retired union lobbyist Frank  
Alexander. ``It's time to show some leadership. We don't agree with 
100 percent of what Gore stands for, but who do we agree with 100 
percent of the time?''

<HEADLINE> Chicago After-Hours Trading Debuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- With a lot of fanfare but few stock transactions,  
the Chicago Stock Exchange on Friday became the first traditional 
exchange to offer after-hours trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Initial trading at the inaugural two-hour late session was very  
light, as expected -- just 17 trades involving 51,836 shares. Floor 
brokers sat glued to banks of computer screens on the paper-strewn 
exchange floor, waiting for electronic orders to come in. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago exchange officials anticipate only a handful of trades  
in the early days and 1,000 to 2,000 trades daily by the middle of 
2000 as wary brokers and investors gradually join in. 
</P>
<P>
	But within a couple of years, they hope, after-hours volume will  
take a quantum leap. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a short-term strategy,'' said Bob Forney, chief  
executive of the Chicago exchange, before ringing the first 
extended session into action. ``We fully expect this market to grow 
slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long-term, however, extended trading hours are here to stay,''  
he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the early investor caution in a country where online trading  
rivals Beanie-baby collecting as a hobby and where people are 
investing more than ever? 
</P>
<P>
	For one thing, experts warn that consumers have more risks  
after-hours because with low volume and a marketplace scattered 
among disconnected electronic trading systems, it may be difficult 
to find the best price. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also the factor that Chicago -- trying to shed its tag as  
a regional exchange -- may not want to admit: After-hours trading 
won't have fully arrived until the New Yorkers offer it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago exchange is America's third largest stock market  
behind the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
However, Chicago averages about 65 million to 70 million shares a 
day, while the two others regularly surpass 800 million trades a 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would expect to see baby steps until one of the major  
markets, such as maybe the Nasdaq, decides to pull the trigger 
after the turn of the century,'' said analyst Russell Keene of 
Putnam, Lovell, De Guardiola and Thornton in New York. ``Then 
people will put a lot more faith in the quotes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 311 most-active stocks from the NYSE, Nasdaq and the  
American Stock Exchange were traded initially in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect investors from wide price swings that might take  
place when only a small number of people are trading, investors are 
allowed to submit only limit orders -- orders to buy or sell a 
security at a specific price. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange says investors should have a better chance of  
finding desirable prices than in nontraditional electronic 
exchanges because Chicago is a two-sided market -- market-makers 
ensure buying and selling. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the likelihood of slower trading, after-hours trading  
was inaugurated on a Friday afternoon so any glitches in the 
trading system could be fixed over the weekend. Exchange officials 
said they also wanted to keep their 2-month-old pledge that the 
sessions would begin in October.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Pass on Blauser, Santiago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs have declined a $7 million  
option on infielder Jeff Blauser and a $3.5 million option on 
catcher Benito Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
	Blauser signed an $8.4 million, two-year contract in December  
1997, but he hit a combined .226 with 13 homers and 52 RBIs in his 
two years with the team and started only 40 of the 104 games he 
played this season. He gets a $200,000 buyout instead of the 
option. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs, who announced the moves Thursday, hoped Santiago would  
provide power, but the 1987 NL Rookie of the Year hit .249 with 
seven home runs and 36 RBIs in 109 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Santiago had a $1.5 million base salary last season and made  
$200,000 in performance bonuses. He gets a $500,000 buyout.

<HEADLINE> US Warns of Y2K Problems Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department has authorized the  
voluntary departure of eligible family members and nonessential 
employees from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova before Jan. 1 
because of potential Y2K-related disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was disclosed Friday in separate travel warnings  
issued for each country. The warning on Russia said the department 
is concerned about ``potential disruptions in energy supplies that 
may impact the health and safety of U.S. citizens residing or 
traveling in Russia, the duration of which is unknown,'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said U.S. citizens should consider deferring travel to Russia  
until the extent of Y2K-related disruptions becomes clear. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Americans who would be eligible to depart Russia  
and the other countries was not disclosed. The announcement would 
affect nonessential employees at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow and 
U.S. consulates in three Russian cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prolonged disruptions in energy supplies in Russia could put  
other systems dependent on electrical power at risk,'' the 
announcement said. ``In practical terms, this could mean disruption 
of basic human services such as heat, water, telephone and other 
vital services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Similar language was used in the warnings for Belarus and  
Moldova. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning on Ukraine said voluntary departure of eligible  
Americans was being authorized even though a U.S. government-funded 
study indicated a low risk of major disruptions to heat and 
electrical service in that country. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the warnings said U.S. embassies and consulates abroad  
do not have facilities to provide private U.S. citizens overseas 
with food, water, fuel, medicines, shelter or other equipment in 
the event of disruption of essential services. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Thursday, the CIA informed Congress that it is ``highly  
confident'' Y2K computer failures will not lead to the accidental 
launch of a ballistic missile by any country. 
</P>
<P>
	But it expressed some concern over the safety of aging  
Soviet-era nuclear power plants in Russia and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Embassy spokesman Mikhail Shurgalin had no immediate  
comment on the U.S. announcement. Two weeks ago, Russian Deputy 
Security Chief Vladislav Sherstyuk said Russia will switch some 
crucial processes to manual control during the year 2000 changeover 
because it cannot afford to fix the Y2K bug on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The State Communications Committee, which is in charge of  
Russia's preparations for the changeover, earlier said Russia will 
also reduce the number of airplane flights on Dec. 31 and halt some 
hazardous industrial processes. 
</P>
<P>
	For some time, the State Department has been preparing warnings  
for Americans living or traveling in 194 nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, it warned that in China there ``may be a risk of  
potential disruption in the key sectors of banking and finance, 
telecommunications, medical services and in electrical power and 
infrastructure systems outside of the coastal cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the prevailing view among senior embassy diplomats in China  
is that Y2K problems will be minimal in Beijing and other major 
Chinese cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're more confident that things here won't fall apart than  
people in Washington,'' one diplomat said. He added that the 
embassy recommendation is not to authorize voluntary departures.

<HEADLINE> 'Gay Panic' Alleged in Wyo. Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- A man testified Friday that he was the  
object of a sexual advance by Matthew Shepard in a tavern hours 
before the gay college student was pistol-whipped into a coma and 
left to die. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was really offensive to me,'' Michael St. Clair told jurors  
as the defense opened its case in Aaron McKinney's murder trial. 
``It set off something inside. It made me angry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, is charged with robbery, kidnapping and murder,  
and could be sentenced to death if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyers are trying to convince the jury that he snapped  
during a drunken, drug-induced rage after a sexual advance by 
Shepard triggered memories of a childhood homosexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Clair was in the Fireside Lounge in Laramie on Oct. 6, 1998,  
the night Shepard met McKinney and Russell Henderson. He said 
Shepard approached, asked to sit with him and then made a sexual 
suggestion. Later, St. Clair said he watched as Shepard left with 
McKinney and Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the two lured Shepard out of the bar, took him  
to a remote area, and then robbed and beat him. Henderson, 22, 
pleaded guilty to murder and kidnapping and is serving two life 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the defense testimony began, attorneys asked the judge to  
allow them to use the ``gay panic'' strategy, contending it is 
crucial for jurors to understand why the roofer beat Shepard to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	``These life experiences may say how he reacted that evening,''  
defense attorney Dion Custis said in a hearing after prosecutors 
rested their case. ``That is for a jury to decide, not the court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Cal Rerucha countered that such testimony would give  
others an excuse to kill people they don't like, such as 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't have a conspiracy of two people who go out and  
pretend to be homosexuals and commit a robbery and claim homosexual 
panic,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Barton Voigt said he would rule on the issue Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	The ``gay panic'' or ``homosexual panic'' defense is built on a  
theory that a person with latent homosexual tendencies will have an 
uncontrollable, violent reaction when propositioned by a 
homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
	During four days of testimony, prosecutors drew a timeline of  
the events, culminating in the playing of McKinney's jailhouse 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney's former girlfriend, Kristen Price, told jurors  
McKinney and Henderson planned to pose as homosexuals and rob 
Shepard, and McKinney later acknowledged they had killed someone. 
</P>
<P>
	Legal analyst Andrew Cohen, who has followed the case, said  
Rerucha presented a swift, compact prosecution, ending with 
McKinney in his own words. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the most powerful evidence they have,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Violent 'Plot' Closes Ohio School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By M.R. KROPKO    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Authorities ordered a high school closed today  
and arrested four students, saying they uncovered an apparent 
racist plot by students to stage ``violent acts'' there. 
</P>
<P>
	Several South High School students admitted planning an attack  
with guns and explosives, similar to the one carried out by two 
students at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., last April, 
The Plain Dealer reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael R. White this afternoon said two guns were  
confiscated when police carried out four search warrants Thursday 
night, but no firearms or explosives were found at the school. 
</P>
<P>
	White said four students had been arrested and were being held  
on charges of inciting to violence, false alarm, aggravated 
menacing and ethnic intimidation, and inducing panic. He called the 
plot racially motivated and said the suspects were white and the 
school has a majority black enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
	But he wouldn't comment on the report that the plan had been for  
a Columbine-style attack. And he wouldn't say whether authorities 
think the guns they found were related to the alleged plot. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the four had earlier checked himself into a mental  
hospital, White said. In addition to the four, seven other students 
were being questioned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not playing around,'' White said. ``There is going to  
be a zero tolerance to any child bringing violence into a school in 
the Cleveland Municipal School District.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The parents of a South High student alerted authorities to the  
alleged plot, White said. The school has 1,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
	Dan Bailey, who joined other parents and students outside the  
school this morning, said police arrested his 14-year-old son, 
Adam, early today and searched the teen-ager's room, taking a 
computer and some disks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bailey said his son had never been in trouble with the school or  
police, but ``hung out with the wrong crowd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to compare it to Columbine. It's ridiculous,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A girl who said she was suspended told WJW-TV that the students  
are being misjudged and that the whole thing might have been 
started by one person as a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's making me mad that everyone's saying that this is like  
another Columbine,'' said the girl, who appeared on camera but 
would not give her name. ``This has nothing to do with Columbine, 
it's a completely different thing, ... everyone's just jumping to 
conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer said some students dressed in black Thursday  
got the attention of school security officers, and were questioned 
about the rumored attack and sent home with parents. 
</P>
<P>
	At Columbine, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, killed 13  
people and wounded 23 others at the school on April 20 before 
killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	South High's homecoming game and dance scheduled for tonight  
were canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, White had said some ``documents'' that were found  
Thursday appear to be evidence of a planned attack. He refused to 
specify what those documents were. Eleven students at the school 
face possible disciplinary action, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Plain Dealer reported that some students gave written  
statements to police, saying they planned to use guns, to be 
obtained from a gang, and homemade explosives to kill teachers, 
administrators and fellow students. It was unclear whether the 
students already had any weapons, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Smith, whose 17-year-old son, Maurice, goes to South High,  
said she was pleased the school was closed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been a real tragedy,'' she said. ``Half the  
doors were locked and it could have been a real mess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the investigation, security at all 120 schools in  
the 77,000-student district was being increased today. White said 
the security measures will continue until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	South High School is to reopen Monday with Cleveland police  
officers and hand-held metal detectors to scan students before they 
enter, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Stumps for Candidate in Pa. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- President Clinton urged Democrats today to  
turn out in strength at the polls next week in a close battle for 
control of city hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised Democratic mayoral candidate John Street  
as a ``vigorous, brilliant, committed public servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``His heart is on fire for the children and the future of this  
city,'' Clinton said before a La Salle University crowd. ``He has 
all the experience in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Philadelphia's reputation as a heavily Democratic city,  
Street is running neck-and-neck in the polls with Republican rival 
Sam Katz. Clinton said Street's record as city council president 
proves he can balance budgets and keep the economy sound. 
</P>
<P>
	``Reward his record,'' the president said.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's speech was interrupted by a handful of demonstrators  
protesting the Naval bombing exercises on Puerto Rico's Vieques 
Island. The group was eventually led from the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	During an interview with a Philadelphia radio show Tuesday,  
Clinton said the outcome of the mayor's race ``will have a big 
impact on national politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Street becomes the first Democrat to lose the mayor's race in  
a half century, it could influence next year's re-election race of 
Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa. It also could affect which political 
party carries Pennsylvania, a swing state in national elections, in 
next year's presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd was warmed up by a hoarse Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,  
D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	``On Halloween night, it's trick or treat, and we're going to  
treat the people here in Philadelphia,'' Kennedy said. ``We're 
going to treat the people of Philadelphia with John Street.''

<HEADLINE> Clarke: Forget Lindros Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers steadied themselves  
after an 0-5-1 start that put some early tarnish on their Stanley 
Cup hopes. They're back in contention for first place. Things 
should be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from it.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Lindros is out with a persistent, mysterious illness. Coach  
Roger Neilson survived rumors about his job, but can't shake a 
virus he's had for a month. General manager Bob Clarke looks ready 
to pounce as he stands ominously in the executive box during games. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite body language to the contrary, Clarke said Friday he's  
not going to panic -- and that means forget about trading No. 88. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trading Lindros,'' Clarke said in his New Jersey  
office, one day after the Flyers, playing without Lindros, blew a 
4-0 lead in the third period before coming back to beat Colorado 
5-4 in overtime. ``We're not trading anybody. Teams ask about a lot 
of players, but it doesn't mean you're trading them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also doesn't mean that players are immune to the rumblings,  
especially Lindros. He and his father, Carl Lindros, who is also 
his agent, make no secret of their belief that the Flyers have 
entertained trade offers for one of the most dynamic players in the 
game. Before the season, Lindros lamented having been ``shopped 
around the league'' in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lindros and longtime linemate John LeClair are signed  
only through this season, there is no indication Clarke has 
anything in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers have more pressing concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	With forwards Rod Brind'Amour and Keith Jones sidelined with  
injuries, the Flyers started 0-5-1, the worst start in their 
32-year history. They promptly won four straight, quieting the 
alarm, but glaring weaknesses resurfaced in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, trying to play despite his illness, had one of the  
worst games of his career Tuesday night in a 5-2 loss to Vancouver 
in which the Canucks overwhelmed Philadelphia with speed. Lindros 
and LeClair were on the ice for four Vancouver goals, and each made 
a glaring turnover that led to a score. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros has four goals in 11 games and is minus-5. LeClair  
played better Thursday night, but has four goals in 12 games and is 
minus-7. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lindros home in bed Thursday night, the Flyers blew a 4-0  
lead against the Avalanche by allowing four goals on eight shots in 
8:09. Valeri Zelepukin saved them with a goal that was supposed to 
be a pass with 8.2 seconds left in OT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got good people in this locker room who stick  
together,'' said Mark Recchi, the Flyers' best player thus far with 
a team-high five goals and 18 points. ``That's why we got through 
that 0-5-1. The concern was very minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke was a conspicuous presence throughout the game, standing  
and pacing around his box high above the ice. He said nothing 
should be gleaned from that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit lots of times,'' Clarke said. ``Just however I feel that  
night, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, whose season was cut short last year by a scary,  
draining bout with a collapsed lung, has been sick for more than a 
week. Doctors are calling it a virus, and Clarke shot down 
speculation that Lindros was anemic. He's questionable for 
Saturday's home game against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors tell us that he is not anemic,'' Clarke said. ``He  
has a virus and is very run down, which is what a virus does to 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson, who has been sick for a month, is considering Clarke's  
offer to take a couple of days off during the team's upcoming road 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke suggested that Neilson, whose girlfriend lives in Dallas,  
should fly there Sunday and rest before rejoining the team 
Wednesday in Anaheim. Assistants Wayne Cashman and Craig Ramsay, 
both with head coaching experience, would run practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson is wary, because only two weeks ago he was being  
bombarded with questions about his job security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly considering it,'' Neilson said. ``I'll wait and  
see how I feel. I'm always a little skeptical of being sent away, 
so I probably won't go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke, practicing the patience he's preaching, made only a

<HEADLINE> Report: Drug-Resistant TB Spreads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Many countries are ill-equipped to combat the  
spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis, already in 104 countries and 
the world's leading infectious cause of death among adults, a new 
study says. 
</P>
<P>
	It will take $1 billion to fight its growth, according to the  
Harvard Medical School study sponsored by philanthropist George 
Soros. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian prisons are among the epicenters of the hard-to-treat  
and potentially fatal disease. About 100,000 inmates have active TB 
and about 40 percent have drug-resistant TB, prison chief Gen. 
Vladimir Yalinin said at a Thursday news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30,000 people with active cases are released from prison  
there each year, and 400 prison workers have developed TB, Yalinin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These epidemics are only briefly local,'' said Dr. Paul  
Farmer, a professor of social medicine at Harvard and author of the 
report. ``They will not remain within prisons, they will not remain 
within national borders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	TB is the leading infectious cause of death among adults  
worldwide, killing up to 2 million people each year. Eight million 
are infected annually by the airborne disease, which can spread 
through contact as casual as sitting on the same airplane with 
someone who is infected. 
</P>
<P>
	The study says a TB strategy successfully implemented in New  
York City in the mid-1990s -- deploying health workers to watch 
patients take each and every dose -- is the only way to cure the 
disease and stop the proliferation of drug-resistant strains. 
</P>
<P>
	While the approach required less than a year of treatment for  
each case, new strains of multi-drug-resistant TB may require up to 
two years of complex treatment, costing anywhere from several 
hundred dollars to several thousand per patient. 
</P>
<P>
	Many countries lack the funding, personnel and public health  
infrastructure for such an intensive method of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The report identified TB hot spots -- countries where at least 5  
percent of all TB cases are drug-resistant. The highest percentage 
of drug-resistant TB cases were found in Latvia, at 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind Latvia was the Delhi state in India, Estonia, the Henan  
province of China, the Dominican Republic, Argentina, the Ivanovo 
region of Russia and the Ivory Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also suggests that physicians in many countries are  
improperly prescribing TB drugs, contributing to the problem.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Plane Crashed at 600 mph </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) -- Payne Stewart's Learjet was going about  
600 mph when it struck the ground, the chief government 
investigator said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Benzon of the National Transportation Safety Board based the  
speed estimate on the condition of the cockpit voice recorder taken 
from the wreckage. The golfer's plane carved a 10-foot-deep crater 
in the ground, and the aircraft and the six people aboard were torn 
to pieces. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know it was well over 100 times the force of gravity, based  
on the fact that the flight recorder is only guaranteed to 100 Gs 
and it broke,'' Benzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the voice recorder was in such bad shape that the NTSB  
decided to send it to Seattle so its manufacturer could help with 
the readout. The unit uses electronics to store information, rather 
than a magnetic tape of the sort used in a tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
	The device is a 30-minute loop that records over itself, so  
officials do not expect to hear anything from when the plane veered 
off course because that happened hours before the crash. But it 
might have picked up cockpit sounds, such as the wind or the 
engine, that could provide clues. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators continued Friday to sort through mangled pieces of  
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Learjet flew 1,400 miles across the country,  
apparently on autopilot, until it ran out of fuel. Government 
officials and pilots have said one possible explanation is that it 
lost cabin pressure soon after takeff from Florida, causing 
everyone on board to die or lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ghostly journey, the jet -- shadowed by military  
planes -- was flying as much as nine miles high. When it ran out of 
fuel, it went into a spiral and plummeted the final two miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The wreckage was taken to a hangar in Aberdeen, and parts that  
may yield clues to the crash will be shipped to various places for 
analysis. Search crews had to pick through thousands of parts and 
pry apart metal, plastic, fabric, rubber and glass. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a very pretty exercise,'' Benzon said. ``Everything  
from crowbars to sledgehammers and dental picks are used. We try to 
eliminate what went right and what parts look good and perhaps 
account for something suspicious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bone and tissue from the plane's occupants are being analyzed to  
see whether carbon monoxide may have contributed to the crash, or 
if one of the two pilots had a heart attack, Benzon said. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be several months before the wreckage is fully  
analyzed. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is restructuring its North  
American operations in a move designed to give executives more 
control over product development that may help reestablish the 
former Chrysler Corp's more freewheeling, open culture. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes announced Friday include the retirement of Ron  
Boltz, senior vice president for product strategy and regulatory 
affairs and general manager for passenger car operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Boltz, who is leaving Dec. 31, will be replaced by Susan M.  
Cischke, who will hold the title of senior vice president for 
regulatory affairs and passenger car operations. Ms. Cischke had 
been vice president of vehicle certification, compliance and 
regulatory affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The reorganization also changes the role of two other senior  
vice presidents and creates a new vice president position for 
product planning. 
</P>
<P>
	``With these organizational changes, DaimlerChrysler Corp. is  
truly ready to move forward,'' said Bob Eaton and Juergen Schrempp, 
co-chairmen of DaimlerChrysler AG. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will allow DaimlerChrysler to centralize product  
planning functions, enhance overall product development 
capabilities and refocus manufacturing and engineering operations, 
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reorganization ... recognizes the critical nature of  
maintaining an appropriate level of autonomy and responsibility for 
individual businesses,'' said Jim Holden, president of 
DaimlerChrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The management changes are standard during a reorganization  
effort but send a needed signal that DaimlerChrysler is not losing 
the former Chrysler Corp.'s character, said David Cole, director of 
the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the 
University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have a really strong and vested interest in preserving  
the flexibility and all of what has made Chrysler good,'' Cole 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Holden is really trying to put his team together to  
support what the Chrysler side is doing,'' Cole said. ``That really 
became more of an issue with the departure of Tom Stallkamp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stallkamp, president of DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler division,  
announced his retirement last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The other management changes include:  
</P>
<P>
	--Richard O. Schaum becomes senior vice president for platform  
engineering and quality and general manager for powertrain 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--Bernard I. Robertson is appointed senior vice president for  
engineering technologies and general manager for truck operations. 
</P>
<P>
	--John C. Miller fills the new position of vice president for  
product planning. He had been the vice president and general 
manager for large car platform engineering.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Warns on Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
appears to be keeping his options open about what the Fed's next 
move on interest rates should be. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech to chief executives of the some of the country's  
largest corporations, Greenspan expressed worries about what could 
happen to inflation if a recent upswing in productivity should 
suddenly falter and tight labor markets begin to push wage demands 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, Greenspan noted that financial markets  
have already pushed long-term interest rates higher in moves that 
also will slow economic growth to a more sustainable pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of these increases in long-term rates, ``the process of  
containment (of unsustainable growth) may already be significantly 
advanced,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many private economists said Greenspan in his remarks Thursday  
night to the Business Council in Boca Raton, Fla., seemed to be 
going out of his way to leave open all the Fed's options -- of 
either raising rates next month for the third time this year if 
conditions require it, or holding off on further rate hikes. 
</P>
<P>
	These analysts said that what the central bank ends up doing  
will depend very much on the economic data released before the Nov. 
16 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed is ready to move if it has to, and I believe the odds  
tilt toward another rate hike, but it is a close call,'' said David 
Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed got some good news before Greenspan spoke Thursday in  
government reports showing that even though the economy grew at a 
sizzling 4.8 percent rate in the third quarter, the fastest pace 
this year, wage pressures remained subdued with the Employment Cost 
Index showing wages and benefits up only 3.1 percent over the past 
12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also released Thursday a major revision of the  
gross domestic product, the nation's total output of goods and 
services, showing that growth this decade has been significantly 
higher than previously reported, with inflation a bit lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan cited the GDP revisions in his remarks Thursday night,  
saying they provided further support to the view that growth in 
productivity, the output per hour of work, has begun to accelerate 
significantly after lagging for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said the newly revised figures on output indicate that  
productivity has been growing by an average of 2.25 percent 
annually over the past five years after averaging just 1.75 percent 
over the previous 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher U.S. productivity growth has allowed the Fed to let  
the economy grow at faster rates without worrying about inflation 
sparked by rising wage demands. 
</P>
<P>
	If workers are more productive, then employers can afford to pay  
them more for the increased output without being forced to raise 
prices on their products. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan warned that the Fed must be particularly alert to  
any signs that this upswing in productivity is faltering, since 
that could lead quickly to inflationary wage increases, given that 
unemployment has fallen to a 29-year low of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rate of growth of productivity cannot continue to increase  
indefinitely. At some point it must, at least, plateau,'' Greenspan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On previous occasions this year in discussing the potential for  
tight labor markets to trigger inflation, Greenspan has said the 
Fed was ready to move promptly at the first sign of accelerating 
price pressures. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed already has raised the federal funds rate, the interest  
that banks charge each other on overnight loans, twice this year, 
first on June 30 and then again on Aug. 25, pushing the funds rate 
to 5.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan noted that long-term rates set by market forces  
have also been rising and this is already working to slow economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Going forward, the Federal Reserve must monitor not only this  
response, but also the evolving capacity of our economy to meet 
higher levels of demand,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maintaining balance between these forces will be essential to  
preserving the stable price environment that has provided a firm 
foundation for this period of extraordinary innovation and progress 
in the U.S. economy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stewart Remembered in Mississippi  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Payne Stewart the man, not the U.S. Open  
champion, was remembered by PGA Tour players Andy Bean and Bradley 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take away all of Payne's victories, take away all of his money  
and all of his awards and I would be a proud and happy father if my 
sons grew up to be the way Payne Stewart was,'' said Bryant, whose 
sons are 6 and 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours after completing their rounds at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic on Thursday, Bean and Bryant spoke during a memorial 
service for Stewart, the U.S. Open champion who along with five 
others was killed in a plane accident on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant also passed along a message from Stewart's wife, Tracey,  
who said her husband would have been proud of the tremendous 
outpouring of support given to her and their two children in the 
wake of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The support we are giving her now is good, but it has to go  
on,'' Bryant told fellow golfers. ``Tracey, Aaron and Chelsea, out 
of our love, out of our respect and out of our friendship we have 
for Payne, let's be there for his family, not just tomorrow but for 
the months and years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bean's friendship with Stewart dated back to 1982. He said he  
had seen many changes in Stewart in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last five or six years, I grew to respect Payne more  
and more. Not only had he matured as a golfer, but as a man,'' Bean 
said. ``He was a better husband and a better father. Golf was a job 
now, not the most important thing in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could only have been possible because Payne came to know  
Jesus Christ and trusted him. The last two or three years of his 
life, anyone would have been proud to walk in those shoes. Not to 
the tournaments he was in or the tournaments he won, but because he 
matured more than he ever had before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 players and caddies were among those who took part in  
the memorial service at Colonial Heights Baptist Church in Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the players at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic,  
including first-round leader Russ Cochran, were not there because 
they had already flown to Florida for a memorial service there 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Tour Championship in Houston, play at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic has been suspended until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant, a 22-year-old Tour veteran who is retiring from  
competitive golf after this week, is a stroke off the lead at the 
Southern Farm Bureau after his opening-round 7-under-par 65 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When he later took the podium at the church with images of his  
friend on a screen above him, golf seemed trivial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Payne is with Jesus tonight because I know Payne put  
his trust in Jesus, not in himself and not in anything else,'' 
Bryant said. ``I plan to see Payne again. I'm going to Heaven, I've 
trusted God, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passing along a message from fellow PGA Tour player Paul  
Azinger, Bryant said no one has lost Stewart, even though he died 
in a tragic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be lost when you know where you are at, and all your  
friends know where you are at,'' Bryant said.

<HEADLINE> Players at Miss. Event Mourn Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Miss. (AP) -- Ed Dougherty sought solace on the driving  
range, his emotions drained after watching television coverage of 
Payne Stewart's memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad Friday,'' said the burly Dougherty, whose eyes were  
red and swollen from tears. ``I just saw Paul Azinger's speech and 
I couldn't handle it. I knew I had to get out of there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the service at Orlando, Fla., Stewart's hometown, Azinger  
delivered a moving tribute after donning a tam o'shanter cap and 
rolling up his pants into makeshift knickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty and many other golfers at the Southern Farm Bureau  
Classic watched TV in the clubhouse at Annandale Golf Club. About 
40 of the 131 players in the tournament flew to Florida for the 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's such a private moment right now for his family, I don't  
know if I can handle it as well as his wife and family,'' Dougherty 
said. ``Mourning is a private thing and Payne is a public figure. 
I'm just torn between both places.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dougherty was among about 100 players and caddies who attended a  
memorial service for Stewart at a Jackson church Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	As the service in Orlando was ending, about a dozen players were  
on the Annandale driving range and a half-dozen were on the 
practice green. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mostly, it's very quiet,'' said Sandy Lyle, a former Masters  
and British Open champion. ``Golfers are used to a lot of different 
routines, but this week is a little different. It's all for a good 
cause, to show our appreciation to Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With play at the Southern Farm suspended until Saturday because  
of the Stewart service, the Annandale course, except for the 
practice areas, was off limits to players. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of about 40 players, including John Daly, played Friday  
at Dancing Rabbit, an exclusive course at the Silver Star Casino on 
the Choctaw Indian reservation about an hour from Annandale. 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Cochran, who needs a solid showing in the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic to keep his PGA Tour card, flew to Florida after an 
8-under 64 gave him the first-round lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Golf-wise, it's probably not the best situation for me, but  
it's the right thing,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Schiller Quits Turner Sports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Harvey Schiller resigned Friday as president of  
Turner Sports and is expected to become chief executive officer of 
YankeeNets, the holding company of the baseball and basketball 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller, the former executive director of the U.S. Olympic  
Committee, had been with Turner Sports, a division of Time Warner 
Inc., since 1994. He also is president of the NHL's latest 
expansion team, the Time Warner-owned Atlanta Thrashers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Turner Sports did not make any announcement, his departure  
was confirmed by a broadcasting official who spoke on the condition 
he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	A person with knowledge of the YankeeNets' plans, also speaking  
on the condition of anonymity, said Schiller's hiring could be 
announced as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been approached by the YankeeNets about becoming CEO  
after the two teams announced the merger in February, but spurned 
the overtures as recently as September. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger of the World Series champions and the Nets has been  
approved by the NBA, but has not yet been approved by baseball. A 
baseball owners' meeting may be scheduled in November to vote on 
the YankeeNets deal and the proposed sale of the Montreal Expos, a 
senior baseball official said Friday on the condition he not be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Yankees owner George Steinbrenner sought the merger after sale  
talks with Cablevision System Corp. collapsed after the 1998 World 
Series. The Yankees' $486 million, 12-year contract with 
Cablevision's MSG Network expires after next season and the Nets' 
contract with Fox Sports New York, another Cablevision unit, 
expires after the 2001-02 season. 
</P>
<P>
	By merging, the two teams will have much greater leverage in  
negotiations for their next broadcast contracts. By providing 
12-month-a-year programming, they could approach Turner or The Walt 
Disney Co.'s ESPN unit about starting a new regional sports cable 
network or even form their own network. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller, who attended World Series games at Yankee Stadium this  
week, was not in his office Friday afternoon and did not return a 
telephone message seeking comment. YankeeNets spokesman Howard 
Rubenstein declined comment.

<HEADLINE>  Stewart Remembered in Mississippi  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Payne Stewart the man, not the U.S. Open  
champion, was remembered by PGA Tour players Andy Bean and Bradley 
Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take away all of Payne's victories, take away all of his money  
and all of his awards and I would be a proud and happy father if my 
sons grew up to be the way Payne Stewart was,'' said Bryant, whose 
sons are 6 and 8 years old. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours after completing their rounds at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic on Thursday, Bean and Bryant spoke during a memorial 
service for Stewart, the U.S. Open champion who along with five 
others was killed in a plane accident on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant also passed along a message from Stewart's wife, Tracey,  
who said her husband would have been proud of the tremendous 
outpouring of support given to her and their two children in the 
wake of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The support we are giving her now is good, but it has to go  
on,'' Bryant told fellow golfers. ``Tracey, Aaron and Chelsea, out 
of our love, out of our respect and out of our friendship we have 
for Payne, let's be there for his family, not just tomorrow but for 
the months and years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bean's friendship with Stewart dated back to 1982. He said he  
had seen many changes in Stewart in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Over the last five or six years, I grew to respect Payne more  
and more. Not only had he matured as a golfer, but as a man,'' Bean 
said. ``He was a better husband and a better father. Golf was a job 
now, not the most important thing in his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could only have been possible because Payne came to know  
Jesus Christ and trusted him. The last two or three years of his 
life, anyone would have been proud to walk in those shoes. Not to 
the tournaments he was in or the tournaments he won, but because he 
matured more than he ever had before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 players and caddies were among those who took part in  
the memorial service at Colonial Heights Baptist Church in Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Several of the players at the Southern Farm Bureau Classic,  
including first-round leader Russ Cochran, were not there because 
they had already flown to Florida for a memorial service there 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the Tour Championship in Houston, play at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic has been suspended until Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant, a 22-year-old Tour veteran who is retiring from  
competitive golf after this week, is a stroke off the lead at the 
Southern Farm Bureau after his opening-round 7-under-par 65 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	When he later took the podium at the church with images of his  
friend on a screen above him, golf seemed trivial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know Payne is with Jesus tonight because I know Payne put  
his trust in Jesus, not in himself and not in anything else,'' 
Bryant said. ``I plan to see Payne again. I'm going to Heaven, I've 
trusted God, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Passing along a message from fellow PGA Tour player Paul  
Azinger, Bryant said no one has lost Stewart, even though he died 
in a tragic accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't be lost when you know where you are at, and all your  
friends know where you are at,'' Bryant said.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Execution Put on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Richard C. Johnson was scheduled to die  
today for killing a state trooper, but his execution has been put 
on hold following a controversial confession from a Nebraska woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, 36, faced lethal injection for the September 1985  
shooting death of Bruce K. Smalls during a traffic stop. Johnson, 
of Morehead City, N.C., also was convicted of killing a Virginia 
man who had given him and two other hitchhikers a ride. 
</P>
<P>
	But the South Carolina Supreme Court on Thursday stayed the  
execution in response to statements from Connie Hess, a fellow 
traveler of Johnson's whose testimony was used to convict him. 
</P>
<P>
	Recanting last week in a sworn affidavit, Hess said it was she,  
not Johnson, who killed the trooper. She also said the third 
hitchhiker killed the Virginia man. Johnson was given a life 
sentence for the driver's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess, who was 17 at the time, said she confessed now to ease her  
conscience. She said she lied originally because ``the solicitor 
told me I would fry'' if she committed the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said they needed more time to examine the case and  
promised to rule no later than Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	John Blume, Johnson's lawyer, called the delay ``a good sign,''  
but added: ``I would hesitate to read too much into it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess' confession is complicated by her history of mental  
illness, state Attorney General Charlie Condon said. Hess lives in 
a Norfolk, Neb., supervised facility for the mentally ill, and all 
evidence in the case shows Johnson to be the trooper's killer, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``we want every last question that the court may have in  
this case answered satisfactorily before the execution is carried 
out,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trooper's mother, Thelma Blue, appealed to Gov. Jim Hodges  
to give clemency to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Killing Mr. Johnson if he is innocent would be an  
abomination,'' she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay an hour  
before Virginia planned to execute a 31-year-old man for robbing 
and killing a couple in 1993. The justices agreed to hear the 
appeal of Michael W. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Hartung, one of his attorneys, said the court agreed to  
consider portions of the 1996 Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death 
Penalty Act, a wide-ranging law passed after the Oklahoma City 
federal building was bombed in 1995. The law generally limits the 
circumstances under which state inmates can make federal appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	And in Texas, a man convicted of raping and fatally beating a  
94-year-old woman as she watered her flowers was executed by 
injection Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Domingo Cantu, 31, was the 28th inmate executed in Texas this  
year and the 82nd nationwide, the most since 83 were put to death 
in 1952.

<HEADLINE> NBA Takes Grizzlies Sale Off Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The vote on the sale of the Vancouver Grizzlies  
to billionaire Bill Laurie was taken off the agenda for today's NBA 
Board of Governors meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA confirmed the change of agenda. The Board of Governors  
meeting will include an update on rules changes for this season, 
which opens Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Laurie, who already owns the St. Louis Blues and the Kiel  
Center, bought the Grizzlies from John McCaw for about $150 million 
on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation Laurie plans to move the team to St.  
Louis. If the team leaves Vancouver, he must pay McCaw $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies entered the league in 1995. Under the terms of the  
expansion agreement, they cannot move until the 2001-02 season.

<HEADLINE> Fed Says It's Ready for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Social Security Administration is readying  
jet-fueled generators, the Internal Revenue Service is prepared to 
write tax refund checks manually and the Pentagon is sharing 
secrets with the Russians as part of a government effort to avoid 
crises related to the Y2K computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	IRS chief information officer Paul Cosgrave, questioned at a  
House hearing Friday about concerns that the tax agency was prone 
to Y2K disruptions, gave assurances that systems are ready and no 
one will lose a refund check. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agencies are given high marks for fixing computers so  
they won't misread the year 2000 for 1900, a mistake that could 
cause widespread computer breakdowns. Friday's hearing focused on 
the contingency plans the agencies have for unexpected problems and 
what they'll be doing just before and after the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House office on the Y2K problem, headed by John  
Koskinen, is to run an information coordination center to monitor 
developments in the public and private sectors as the new year 
begins. Most agencies will have command centers to assure a smooth 
transition to the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	John Dyer of the Social Security Administration said his agency  
will take its system off-line on Dec. 30 to allow the collection of 
all 1999 computer transactions, and that just before midnight on 
the 31st the main data center in Baltimore will switch to 
jet-fueled generators to guard against electrical surges. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Martin Langston, the Defense Department's top Y2K official,  
said the on-duty staff will be boosted by up to 10 percent in the 
New Year period. Russian military officials will arrive in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., on Dec. 22 for a joint exercise aimed at assuring 
that problems in early warning tracking systems don't lead to 
mistaken perceptions that the other side has launched a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Lorentz, chief technology officer of the Postal Service,  
said the mail agency has placed a freeze on all computer systems 
changes through March. Postal officials expect more people to mail 
letters because of concerns about the reliability of computer 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Willemssen of the General Accounting Office, the  
investigative arm of Congress, said the Education Department is 
encouraging schools to obtain information before Jan. 1 so it won't 
have problems in determining student financial aid eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Veterans Affairs Department has suggested that its hospitals  
prepare bottled water and stock waterless soap for the possibility 
that water supplies are interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus on the IRS arose from an Oct. 15 letter by agency  
Commissioner Charles Rossotti to House Ways and Means Committee 
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, in which he said ``the quality of 
the IRS' inventory (equipment) currently poses a high risk to the 
Y2K effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the IRS had taken steps to improve the accuracy of  
its computer systems and that ``if problems surface when the clocks 
roll over into the new year, we will be prepared to deal with them 
before they begin to affect taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrave said the IRS has been working for about 15 years on the  
problem of highly decentralized records in some 800,000 pieces of 
equipment, with the accuracy rate now increased to 90 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 99 percent of the IRS' key computer systems are  
Y2K-compliant, and many of those systems were successfully tested 
during the 1999 filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS will resort to issuing refunds manually if automatic  
systems failed, but that shouldn't pose a problem because the 
agency doesn't start sending many refunds until the end of January, 
Cosgrave said.

<HEADLINE> Backstreet Boys To Be in TV Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Here's the concept: MTV's ``Real World''  
meets a Backstreet Boys-type singing group for a new TV show about 
the boys' struggles for fame and love. 
</P>
<P>
	The scenario sounded so tempting that ABC Entertainment decided  
to produce such a show in Orlando next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The half-hour series, tentatively titled ``O-town,'' will follow  
the making of a male singing group. TV cameras will document 
auditions, selection of the five band members, the songwriting 
process and preparation for a live performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The group will be guided by Trans Continental Records President  
Lou Pearlman, the boy band guru who has guided the Backstreet Boys 
and N'Sync to chart-topping fame. 
</P>
<P>
	MTV Productions will produce the show in association with  
Bunim/Murray Productions. Production is expected to wrap up by 
February.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton: Impeachment May Hurt Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By TERENCE HUNT    	
</P>
<P>
                    *AP White House Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says Vice President Al Gore  
should not be held responsible but probably will pay a political 
price for the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the bitter impeachment 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people who may not like me may hold it  
against him,'' the president acknowledged Thursday for the first 
time. But Clinton went on to say that, ``I don't think mature 
people hold one person responsible for another person's conduct, do 
you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a news conference a day after Gore, struggling  
to fix his troubled campaign for the White House, declared that he 
had been angry and disappointed with the president for his affair 
with Ms. Lewinsky and the pain inflicted by the impeachment battle. 
</P>
<P>
	In a phenomenon that some call ``Clinton fatigue,'' Gore already  
bears scars from his relationship with the president, with polls 
suggesting the vice president would get more votes if he distanced 
himself from Clinton. The vice president appeared to take a step in 
that direction with his blunt criticism of Clinton during a 
televised appearance in New Hampshire with Democratic rival Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton did not fault the vice president, even though some  
White House aides expressed surprise and irritation at what Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said Americans ``are inherently fair. And insofar  
as they do blame him (Gore), I hope they give him some of the 
credit for the longest peacetime expansion in history and the 
lowest unemployment rate in 29 years and the lowest welfare rolls 
in 30 years'' and other achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, people are not dumb,'' the president said. ``They  
vote for what is in their interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to journalists, he said, ``Sometimes some in your  
fraternity ... try to get them confused about what they should be 
voting on or what they should vote against, but in the end they 
almost always get it right and they vote for what's best for 
themselves and their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a joint news conference with the visiting  
leader of Nigeria, President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was elected 
earlier this year on promises to curb corruption and bring stable 
democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before cameras for 50 minutes, Clinton also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Appeared to abandon hope of winning congressional passage this  
year of measures to bolster the Social Security program and provide 
a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. But he said ``it would 
be a great mistake'' to scrap legislation dealing with 
environmental issues and forwarding his goal of hiring 100,000 new 
teachers and 50,000 new police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said Russia should seek a negotiated settlement rather than a  
military victory over the breakaway republic of Chechnya. He said 
the United States hopes ``we will see a minimization of the 
casualties'' and a day soon ``when there will be a negotiated 
solution that all the parties can live with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Accused the National Rifle Association of distorting the record  
with ads asserting that the government is lax in prosecuting gun 
laws already on the books. Clinton said Washington has allowed 
local prosecutors to handle more cases and that the total number of 
prosecutions by federal and local officials is up. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said his meeting next week with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud  
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would be ``just another 
step along the way'' toward a final Mideast settlement. ``I 
wouldn't want to raise expectations excessively,'' Clinton said. He 
will meet with the Mideast leaders at a conference in Oslo, Norway.

<HEADLINE> Man Stuck in Mud Almost Died </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The three hours Kenny Beach spent stuck in the  
bottom of a saltwater creek bed seemed agonizingly long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once the tide started coming in, it was like everything's in  
slow motion,'' said Beach, who was minutes away from drowning in a 
marsh outside Brunswick earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a feeling I never want to have happen again,'' Beach, 28,  
said Thursday in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	When the tide pushed the water up to his nose, he believed he  
would soon drown. He made his peace with God, and then he saw a 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dying's not so bad,'' Beach thought as a calm feeling came  
over him. 
</P>
<P>
	But the light came from rescuers who had been frantically  
searching for him Tuesday evening. Two days after being pulled from 
the muck, Beach still couldn't believe his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
	``Monday's my birthday, and I really thought I wasn't going to  
have another one,'' Beach said. ``I'm still so sore I can hardly 
move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ordeal began after Beach, an architecture student, took his  
small rowboat out into a Fancy Bluff Creek tributary that runs 
behind his house to recover some pieces of a broken dock. 
</P>
<P>
	With his cocker spaniel Goldie along for the ride, Beach made  
his way into a saltwater marsh common to the southeastern Georgia 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the creek was down at low tide, he had to leave the boat  
and walk up the muddy creek bed to retrieve the dock pieces. Beach 
checked his footing before getting out of the boat, but was 
immediately sucked into the sinkhole three steps away. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was instantaneous,'' Beach said. ``I was up to my waist  
before I knew it, and the more I struggled, the more I sank. I was 
eventually in up to my neck, and it created a suction where I 
couldn't get out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At worst, he thought someone would hear his calls for help and  
pull him out within a half-hour or so. Not wanting Goldie to drift 
away, he pulled the boat closer to him and waited. 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour later, Beach's yells for help became more urgent  
as the tide started coming in. His mother-in-law finally heard him 
and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
	While waiting for rescue, Beach said he tried to stay calm.  
</P>
<P>
	``I almost lost it a couple of times, and hallucinated once or  
twice,'' he said. ``Some marsh grass was poking me in the back of 
the neck, and I thought it was a crab eating me, and started 
yelling and banging an oar. And another time I heard a noise and 
was convinced a gator was in the marsh and going to eat me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Darkness, swift current and tight twists of the briny creek  
slowed the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would shout to him to keep his spirits up and let him know  
we were coming, and he would say `The water's up to my chest,' or 
`The water's up to my neck,''' said fireman Craig Renshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last few minutes before his rescue, Beach stopped  
shouting and stretched his neck as far as it would go to keep his 
nostrils above water. When rescuers arrived, they were greeted by 
Goldie, who remained in the boat. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest, about two curves before we got there, we had  
written him off,'' Renshaw said. ``We kept going, but once he 
stopped talking, we figured he was drowning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had the rescuers arrived three or four minutes later, Beach  
would have been submerged. 
</P>
<P>
	He was treated for hypothermia at a hospital Tuesday night and  
released, but he has barely been able to sleep since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I keep thinking about it over and over in my head,'' Beach  
said. ``How close I came to dying is really going to stay with me a 
long time.''

<HEADLINE> IBM Announces Organic Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers at IBM have created a transistor  
made of a combination of organic and inorganic semiconducting 
materials, according to a report in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM researchers said that the hybrid transistor material ``self  
assembles,'' crystallizing from a liquid solution at low 
temperatures. The completed chip is a sandwich with alternating 
layers of inorganic and organic layers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductors made of silicon must be manufactured at high  
temperatures and some electronic displays must be made with both 
high temperatures and a vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	The hybrid transistors can be made more easily, the study said,  
while achieving the operating properties like that of amorphous 
silicon, the material use now to make flat-panel displays. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hybrids might someday be used in mobile computers,  
cellular telephones and new products, such as an electronic 
newspaper than could be folded up and put in a briefcase, the 
report said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Chechen Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- As Western leaders appealed for a peaceful  
solution to the fighting in Chechnya, Russia unleashed a new wave 
of air and artillery strikes in the breakaway republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Jets continued bombing the capital, Grozny, and Chechnya's  
second-largest city, Gudermes, as well as several villages. Russian 
troops had Gudermes cut off from the north and east, but they 
believed there were still about 200 militants in the city, Defense 
Ministry spokesman Gennady Alyokhin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casualty figures were not available for the latest fighting.  
</P>
<P>
	The British Embassy said today it was awaiting word from Russian  
officials on the fate of two Western journalists who were arrested 
Thursday along the border between Chechnya and the Russian region 
of Ingushetia. 
</P>
<P>
	Times of London reporter Anthony Lloyd of Britain and free-lance  
photographer Tyler Hicks, a U.S. citizen, were arrested by Russian 
police as they tried to cross the border. The ITAR-Tass news agency 
said they were arrested for not having press accreditation cards. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott urged  
Russia today to turn from military force to dialogue in Chechnya 
and to avoid civilian casualties. In talks with Russian Foreign 
Minister Igor Ivanov, Talbott said he had conveyed President 
Clinton's concern about the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We understand that Russia has come up against a very dangerous  
threat of extremism and terrorism,'' which gives Russia the ``right 
and duty to protect the state and its citizens,'' Talbott said, 
according to Russian news reports. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he added, the United States hopes that Russia  
will ``turn to political levers as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told reporters  
today that the United States and Russia were involved in a ``normal 
dialogue'' over Chechnya. However, he said no one has the right to 
interfere in Russia's internal affairs, since ``we are struggling 
against the sources of terrorism on Russian territory,'' the 
Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials have said they would not back down in their  
effort to crush the breakaway republic's Islamic militants. The 
militants twice invaded Russia this summer and have been blamed for 
four deadly apartment bombings, two in Moscow and two in southern 
Russia, that killed several hundred people. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two Russian hostages --one held for more than a year --  
were released from captivity in Chechnya and taken to the 
neighboring republic of Dagestan, after an operation by Russia's 
Interior Ministry and Chechen secret services, ITAR-Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that the army private, Imamshamil Abdulkhalilov, had  
been kidnapped Sept. 10, 1998 while on leave in Dagestan. The other 
man, a 27-year-old native of the Saratov region in central Russia 
named Engali Yenaliyev, was taken hostage on March 18. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,300 people have been kidnapped in and around Chechnya  
over the past three years by gangs seeking ransom. More than 700 of 
the hostages have been freed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian military's movements in recent days suggest it is  
trying to retake control of the republic, which has had de facto 
independence since a 1994-96 war. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have come to never go away,'' Defense Minister Igor  
Sergeyev said Thursday during a visit to troops in Chechnya, the 
ITAR-Tass news agency reported. Russian Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, 
first deputy chief-of-staff of the armed forces, said from New York 
that ``any talks with terrorists and killers are out of the 
question,'' according to ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	Manilov said there were no plans for the moment to assault the  
capital, in an effort to avoid civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the 1994-96 Chechen war, Russia's current campaign has  
widespread popular support in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov said his calls for peace talks  
with Russian President Boris Yeltsin are going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``All my proposals to meet with Yeltsin are being ignored. My  
words never reach the president,'' he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maskhadov said 3,265 Chechens had been killed and more than  
5,000 others wounded since Sept. 5, when Russia began launching 
airstrikes on Chechnya. He said Russian troops had destroyed 60 
villages and Chechnya faced a humanitarian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. Gen. Manilov said 1,500 Chechen rebels and 212 Russian  
soldiers have been killed since the offensive began. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of Chechens have fled toward Ingushetia to escape the  
fighting. Next week, a U.N. mission will travel to the region to 
assess the refugees' needs, the United Nations said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton: Impeachment May Hurt Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By TERENCE HUNT    	
</P>
<P>
                    *AP White House Correspondent    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton says Vice President Al Gore  
should not be held responsible but probably will pay a political 
price for the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the bitter impeachment 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of people who may not like me may hold it  
against him,'' the president acknowledged Thursday for the first 
time. But Clinton went on to say that, ``I don't think mature 
people hold one person responsible for another person's conduct, do 
you?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a news conference a day after Gore, struggling  
to fix his troubled campaign for the White House, declared that he 
had been angry and disappointed with the president for his affair 
with Ms. Lewinsky and the pain inflicted by the impeachment battle. 
</P>
<P>
	In a phenomenon that some call ``Clinton fatigue,'' Gore already  
bears scars from his relationship with the president, with polls 
suggesting the vice president would get more votes if he distanced 
himself from Clinton. The vice president appeared to take a step in 
that direction with his blunt criticism of Clinton during a 
televised appearance in New Hampshire with Democratic rival Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton did not fault the vice president, even though some  
White House aides expressed surprise and irritation at what Gore 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said Americans ``are inherently fair. And insofar  
as they do blame him (Gore), I hope they give him some of the 
credit for the longest peacetime expansion in history and the 
lowest unemployment rate in 29 years and the lowest welfare rolls 
in 30 years'' and other achievements. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, people are not dumb,'' the president said. ``They  
vote for what is in their interest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to journalists, he said, ``Sometimes some in your  
fraternity ... try to get them confused about what they should be 
voting on or what they should vote against, but in the end they 
almost always get it right and they vote for what's best for 
themselves and their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke at a joint news conference with the visiting  
leader of Nigeria, President Olusegun Obasanjo, who was elected 
earlier this year on promises to curb corruption and bring stable 
democratic rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before cameras for 50 minutes, Clinton also:  
</P>
<P>
	--Appeared to abandon hope of winning congressional passage this  
year of measures to bolster the Social Security program and provide 
a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. But he said ``it would 
be a great mistake'' to scrap legislation dealing with 
environmental issues and forwarding his goal of hiring 100,000 new 
teachers and 50,000 new police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said Russia should seek a negotiated settlement rather than a  
military victory over the breakaway republic of Chechnya. He said 
the United States hopes ``we will see a minimization of the 
casualties'' and a day soon ``when there will be a negotiated 
solution that all the parties can live with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Accused the National Rifle Association of distorting the record  
with ads asserting that the government is lax in prosecuting gun 
laws already on the books. Clinton said Washington has allowed 
local prosecutors to handle more cases and that the total number of 
prosecutions by federal and local officials is up. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said his meeting next week with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud  
Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat would be ``just another 
step along the way'' toward a final Mideast settlement. ``I 
wouldn't want to raise expectations excessively,'' Clinton said. He 
will meet with the Mideast leaders at a conference in Oslo, Norway.

<HEADLINE> Block on EPA Pollution Rules Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court on Friday reaffirmed a  
decision blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from imposing 
tougher air pollution controls on smog and soot. 
</P>
<P>
	In a split ruling, the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia rejected the government's appeal and kept in 
place a decision in May by a three-judge panel from the court 
overturning the new pollution regulations imposed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials said the Justice Department is  
expected to take the case to the Supreme Court with hopes of a 
decision by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the appeal process moves forward, we will continue to  
pursue all available actions to secure cleaner air for the American 
people,'' EPA Administrator Carol Browner said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton in 1997 directed the EPA to issue the tougher  
air rules, which require states to meet more stringent reductions 
in smog-causing ozone and in microscopic soot. 
</P>
<P>
	The smog and soot regulations were among the most controversial  
ever issued by Browner and drew strong opposition from business and 
industry groups. Environmental and many health experts argued the 
more stringent controls on soot and smog were needed to protect 
children and people with respiratory ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	But in May, a three-judge panel of the appeals court decided 2-1  
to overturn the regulation, saying the EPA had failed to justify 
the pollution levels it selected. The panel also said the soot rule 
was an ``unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority'' 
under the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, five judges on the full 11-member appeals court  
supported the EPA, while four upheld the lower court decision, and 
two did not take part. A majority of the full court was needed to 
approve the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry groups, which had filed the lawsuit challenging the  
regulations, applauded the decision by the full court. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a victory for all businesses and a blow to the EPA,''  
said Tom Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``Once 
again the court agreed with American business that the EPA 
standards were pulled out of thin air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Browner said that while she was ``disappointed'' by the full  
appeals court decision, ``we are encouraged that five of the nine 
judges agreed with the EPA argument.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency intends to ask the Justice Department to take the  
case to the Supreme Court as quickly as possible, with hopes that 
it could be heard during the court's spring session next year, 
agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised air standards imposed by the EPA in 1997 limited  
ozone, an essential part of smog, to 0.08 parts per million, 
instead of 0.12 parts per million under the previous requirement. 
For the first time they also required that states regulate 
microscopic particulates, or soot, from power plants, cars and 
other sources down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times smaller than the 
width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Business groups waged an intense battle against the regulation  
before they were issued in 1997, arguing they were too costly and 
not grounded in adequate science. Later, a broad cross-section of 
groups representing the trucking, utility, chemical, oil and auto 
industries, as well as small businesses, challenged the rules in a 
lawsuit. Three states -- Ohio, Michigan and West Virginia -- also 
joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, Browner announced the EPA was reimposing the old ozone  
standard, while the litigation proceeds on the new standard. If the 
tougher air requirements are killed, ``125 million Americans, 
including 35 million children, will breathe air that doesn't meet 
health standards based on modern science,'' Browner has argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing the dissent, Judge David Tatel said in Friday's ruling  
that the three-judge panel's decision in May departed ``from a 
half-century of Supreme Court separation of powers jurisprudence'' 
and stripped the EPA of its ability to implement the Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Tatel also had dissented in the May 14 decision.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee Finds No NCAA Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- An internal investigation by the  
University of Tennessee found that academic cheating by athletes 
didn't rise to the level of an NCAA infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am satisfied that our investigation has been complete on all  
the allegations, that we have not uncovered anything and we are 
going about our business,'' athletic director Doug Dickey said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, school provost John Peters said the matter wasn't  
settled entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to call for a review of the academic tutoring  
services that are provided to student-athletes,'' he told The 
Knoxville News-Sentinel. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters said he wants to talk to professors about their concerns  
and recommendations for changes in the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Bensel-Meyers, director of the English department's  
composition program who oversees the athletic department tutors, 
said she supported an academic review since the investigation 
seemed focused only on NCAA violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's two-page report concluded a month-long  
investigation by the general counsel's office into allegations that 
tutors did homework for athletes and supervisors failed to tell 
their superiors when professors complained. 
</P>
<P>
	The probe was sparked by an article in ESPN's Internet magazine  
Sept. 26 alleging that tutors gave improper help to athletes, 
particularly football players, as far back as 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20 current and former university employees and eight  
current or former Tennessee athletes were interviewed. None was 
named in the report, which has been sent to the NCAA and the 
Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``In no instance did a student-athlete identified in the course  
of this investigation receive an added benefit in violation of NCAA 
bylaws,'' associate general counsel Ronald Leadbetter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigators found no evidence a tutor ``wrote, typed or  
otherwise authored a paper'' for any athlete in violation of rules. 
They did find one case in which a tutor typed a paper in ``good 
faith'' from an athlete's dictation. But the athlete received no 
credit for it and had to redo the assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said there was no ``cover-up'' in violation of NCAA  
bylaws. 
</P>
<P>
	But it did find unnamed ``athletics department academic support  
officials'' failed to inform Dickey and NCAA compliance officer 
Malcolm McInnis about ``reports of possible plagiarism'' from 
professors and ``the investigative results'' used to dismiss them. 
</P>
<P>
	Dickey called that a ``mistake'' though not so great to break  
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``The lack of promptness does not constitute an NCAA  
violation,'' he said. However, ``a prior reporting of these issues 
would have possibly avoided this controversy.''

<HEADLINE> Ventura Denies Buchanan Snub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDINA, Minn. (AP) -- Gov. Jesse Ventura said today that he  
couldn't see Pat Buchanan on Thursday because ``I was busy doing my 
job,'' and that the Republican turned Reform Party presidential 
candidate declined an offer for an alternate meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking on his weekly radio show, Ventura said he didn't snub  
Buchanan, who on Thursday made his first visit to Minnesota since 
bolting the GOP. The governor said he was already on his way to 
football practice -- he is a volunteer coach -- when Buchanan called 
him late Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura said he offered to have coffee with Buchanan today for  
45 minutes at the governor's residence, but Buchanan declined. 
</P>
<P>
	``They preferred a meeting with media and hoopla,'' Ventura  
said. ``I preferred a private meeting. They chose not to make it 
happen this morning.'' He added, ``I didn't snub anyone. I was busy 
doing my job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, more than 200 people lined up as Buchanan signed  
copies of his controversial book, ``A Republic, Not an Empire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ventura has said Buchanan is welcome in the party. But he's also  
made it clear that he -- the party's highest elected officeholder -- 
wants someone else to be its presidential nominee. He even has left 
open the possibility of entering the race himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan is more conservative on social issues, where the Reform  
Party is neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor's got a right to disagree with me,'' Buchanan  
said. But he cited several reasons why he thinks he is a good fit 
for the party, including his opposition to the North American Free 
Trade Agreement and support of campaign reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is ready to challenge any Reform candidate Ventura  
might support. 
</P>
<P>
	Minnesota Reform Party Chairman Rick McCluhan, who brought  
greetings for Buchanan from the governor, said he doesn't think 
Buchanan will find much support in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of those waiting in line said they were impressed by  
Buchanan's candor. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Rampetsreiter, 28, a Republican and Minneapolis financial  
consultant, said Buchanan ``doesn't back down and stands up for 
what he believes in.''

<HEADLINE> IOC Reform Panel Faces Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- Facing pressure from critics in  
Congress, the International Olympic Committee faces an important 
test this weekend in completing reforms driven by the bribery 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch could be pressed to push  
through some key recommendations, especially those calling for an 
age limit of 70 and a ban on members' visiting Olympic bid cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, many IOC members say they don't want to enact  
reforms just to appease those in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC 2000, an 80-member reform commission, was set up earlier  
this year to reshape the 105-year-old organization following the 
scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 2002 
Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's 26-member executive committee has drafted more than  
50 recommendations that will be discussed by the full commission 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The final proposals -- related to age limits, terms of office,  
makeup of the membership, financial openness and the host city 
selection process -- will be submitted to the IOC general assembly 
for a vote at a special session in Lausanne on Dec. 11-12. 
</P>
<P>
	The reform commission is made up of IOC members and outside  
delegates, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and 
former U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. 
</P>
<P>
	A copy of the executive committee's recommendations was obtained  
by The Associated Press. Key proposals include: 
</P>
<P>
	--appointment of 15 ``active'' athletes, eligible for up to four  
years after their last participation in the Olympics, as full IOC 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	--creation of a special committee to screen candidates for IOC  
membership. 
</P>
<P>
	--introduction of an eight-year term of office, with the  
possibility of re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	--an age limit of 70 for all members (the current limit is 80).  
</P>
<P>
	--a single eight-year term, with no re-election, for the IOC  
president (Samaranch has been in office since 1980). 
</P>
<P>
	--introduction of a bid acceptance procedure, requiring cities to  
meet certain technical requirements before being allowed to submit 
a bid. 
</P>
<P>
	--ban on visits to bid cities.  
</P>
<P>
	The age limit and site visits remain controversial issues and  
could undergo changes this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The limit was changed in 1995 from 75 to 80 to allow Samaranch  
to seek another term. The proposal does not specify how soon the 70 
limit would take effect, although a transition period is 
envisioned. If the rule were applied immediately, 24 current 
members would have to leave. 
</P>
<P>
	The age restriction is also opposed by some possible successors  
to Samaranch, whose term expires in 2001. If the 70 limit is 
adopted, several presidential hopefuls, including Kevan Gosper of 
Australia and Kim Un-Yong of South Korea, would be virtually ruled 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the question of visits to bid cities continues to  
divide the membership. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has been adamant in arguing against visits, which were  
at the root of the scandal over gifts and other inducements offered 
to IOC members by Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	But many members think visits -- with tight controls -- are  
necessary to make an informed choice on the host city. 
</P>
<P>
	The weekend meetings come at a time of increased scrutiny of the  
IOC in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	At a congressional hearing this month, the third this year on  
IOC issues, lawmakers expressed skepticism about the reform efforts 
and threatened swift retribution if the organization fails to enact 
change in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Possible sanctions include legislation to cut off American  
corporate support for the Olympics and strip the IOC's tax-exempt 
status in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to be staying on top of them,'' said Rep. Fred  
Upton, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations. ``Our effort is not to trash the 
Olympics. We want to clean it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch declined to testify at this month's hearing, saying he  
was too busy working on the reforms. But he is to appear before 
Upton's panel Dec. 15 -- three days after the reform vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Some IOC members are upset the hearing is scheduled so close to  
the vote and are urging Samaranch to postpone his appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want to vote under pressure just to please the  
American Congress,'' Italian member Mario Pescante said. ``We want 
to decide without having the impression there is a threat above our 
heads.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Against More Defense Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Standing apart from the field of presidential  
candidates clamoring for bigger defense budgets, Democrat Bill 
Bradley told a disarmament group that he sees no need to increase 
military spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Military spending should be adjusted as needed to protect  
America's most vital and important interests. I believe current 
levels would suffice if the Department of Defense was led and 
managed effectively,'' Bradley replied on a candidate questionnaire 
circulated by Star PAC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iowa group, which lists its full name as ``Stop the Arms  
Race Political Action Committee,'' questioned both Bradley and his 
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Vice President Al 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting the traditional squeamishness of liberal Democrats --  
a voting bloc crucial to winning the party's nomination -- toward 
military spending, Gore took cover under the rubric of the 
administration he's shared with President Clinton. And, campaign 
officials for Gore declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Clinton-Gore administration, beginning with this year's  
defense bill, is supporting sensible and needed increases in 
defense spending over the next several years,'' Gore wrote Star 
PAC. 
</P>
<P>
	A 10-year budget pie chart assembled separately by his campaign  
allocates $127 billion of the projected budget surplus for 
additional defense spending -- compared to $115 billion extra for 
education and $146 billion for health care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those funds will go towards increasing military pay, providing  
more money for the military retirement system and ensuring that our 
troops continue to have the best weapons available,'' Gore wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates' responses to the open-ended question, ``I  
believe the military budget should be ...,'' were read to The 
Associated Press by their respective campaigns on Friday, in 
response to an inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser did not rule pay or benefit  
increases, but said his candidate believes such improvements can be 
paid for by streamlining the Pentagon elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the context of keeping military spending at a steady level,  
there will be opportunities to make adjustments in terms of pay and 
benefits rather than weapons systems we may no longer need,'' 
Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	A task force of the Defense Science Board reported a few years  
back that the Defense Department could save $30 billion a year 
through better management, selected base closures, and by more 
commercial business-type acquisition procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley's position stands out in the 2000 presidential field. In  
addition to Gore, every Republican candidate has called for boosts 
in military spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president and the Congress have allowed the military to  
deteriorate to such an alarming degree that it's almost obscene,'' 
Arizona Sen. John McCain, a Vietnam vet, said in a Republican 
debate Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Joint Chiefs of Staff testified to Congress just this week  
about the military's diminished readiness due to the poor condition 
of equipment and difficulties in recruiting and retaining quality 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing that the U.S. military is not now able to fight two  
major, simultaneous theater wars, the Clinton administration 
requested from Congress a modest increase in defense spending for 
this year, with another $52 billion to be added over the following 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the debate you hear is how much we should increase  
military spending, not whether we should at all,'' said Steven 
Kosiak of Washington's Center for Strategic and Budgetary 
Assessments. 
</P>
<P>
	But, added Kosiak, there are billions of dollars in  
``questionable pork projects'' in the defense budget and, ``Bill 
Bradley's in good company in believing that you can get substantial 
savings through different kinds of acquisition and infrastructure 
reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This latest question of military spending is not the first time  
Gore and Bradley have split on defense issues. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Senate, Bradley voted against Strategic Defense  
Initiative (SDI) deployment and B-2 stealth bombers, and for 
sanctions instead of military force against Iraq. Gore, as a 
senator from Tennessee, voted in support of SDI and B-2s, and for 
cuts in smaller weapons programs.

<HEADLINE> NBC's Gray Criticized by Colleagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Now Jim Gray knows how Pete Rose feels.  
</P>
<P>
	The NBC sports reporter, whose relentless interview with Rose  
before Game 2 of the World Series nearly generated as many 
headlines as the play on the field, is trying to put it all behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what Rose has tried to do for the past 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
	But Gray broke the No. 1 rule of reporting.  
</P>
<P>
	Never become part of the story.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reporter's worst nightmare when you become the story,''  
CBS reporter Armen Keteyian said. ``You do not want to be the story 
-- you are there to inform and enlighten the audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray is at one end of the spectrum, a hard-nosed reporter  
unafraid to ask the tough questions. Ahmad Rashad is at the other 
end, known for his soft line of questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim is a very, very good reporter and will ask the question  
that few people will, but as my mother told me, 'There is a time 
and a place','' Keteyian said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol, who admitted the Rose  
interview might have gone on too long, called Gray ``the best 
reporter in the business, maybe ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray hasn't said much about the interview, other than to defend  
it and later apologize on national TV before Game 3. NBC spokesman 
Ed Markey said Gray is trying to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Gray's colleagues felt he might have crossed the line  
when he kept asking Rose about whether he bet on baseball. The 
interview came moments after Rose took part in the All-Century team 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's exactly why players are leery of the media,'' said  
former San Francisco 49er Brent Jones, now a CBS analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Gray couldn't take the heat and he didn't have the guts to  
say he's wrong,'' Jones added. ``He got what he's done to every 
other guy back in return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was snubbed after the third game of the World Series when  
Chad Curtis refused to answer his questions on live TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a pretty decent reputation, but he's only got three  
minutes with Pete,'' said ESPN radio co-host Rob Dibble, who played 
for Rose with the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``As for the forum, it was not the time or the place to expect  
Pete to give that type of statement,'' added Dibble, whose father 
was a news reporter for 50 years. ``I don't think Jim Gray is the 
conscience of America. I don't think him asking Pete on national TV 
was what NBC wanted him to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Lyons, who would have been in Gray's place if Fox had the  
rights to this year's World Series, has a lot of respect for Gray 
but agreed he went overboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim took it a little too far and I think he feels that way,  
too,'' Lyons said. ``Once he didn't get the answer he wanted, he 
decided to keep badgering Pete. ... I think it was OK to ask once 
because of Pete's history.''

	 *COSELL:* After working for a year to get the family's approval  
and another two years to finish the project, HBO's one-hour 
documentary on Howard Cosell debuts Monday at 8 p.m. ET. 
</P>
<P>
	It shows many sides of the most controversial sportscaster ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``It really does a great job of making you feel the emotions,''  
said ``Monday Night Football'' analyst Boomer Esiason, in New York 
last week for the screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the focus on the documentary is placed on Cosell's  
stormy relationship with ``MNF'' partners Don Meredith and Frank 
Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I was very pleased with it,'' said Cosell's daughter,  
Hilary. ``But it needed more with Alex Karras and Fran Tarkenton. 
Generations of schoolchildren need to know that it wasn't 14 years 
of just Howard, Don and Frank.''

	 *FRIENDLY ADVICE:* Brent Jones roomed with San Francisco  
quarterback Steve Young for nearly a decade. His words of advice 
for his best friend: Quit.

	``I think he ought to retire,'' the CBS analyst said Thursday.  
``He doesn't have anything left to prove. That seems to be the 
consensus. I haven't spoken to one rational person who says to keep 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young sustained a concussion earlier this season that has kept  
him on the sideline ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really thinking this one through,'' Jones said. ``He's so  
well-spoken and well-schooled that he may have a bigger platform 
out of football than in it. But he's so competitive that he wants 
to play.''

	------

<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* NBC World Series analyst Joe Morgan, left off the  
All-Century team, on the selections: ``The committee should have 
used their five picks more wisely. Fans voted better than the 
committee. Not to have one Latin player on the team is not right. 
And they are basically saying that the Negro leagues never 
existed.'' ... ESPN's Chris Fowler makes his college football 
play-by-play debut Thursday. ... USA Home Entertainment and MLB 
released a 71-minute All-Century video on Tuesday. ... ABC college 
football broadcaster Brad Nessler teams with Lynn Swann, normally a 
sideline reporter, for Saturday's Oklahoma-Colorado game. Swann 
moves into the booth because Bob Griese has the week off. ... ESPN 
introduces ``SuperStrator'', a new telestrator, during Sunday

<HEADLINE> Toshiba To Settle Laptop Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Settlement of a U.S. lawsuit alleging a defect in  
some 5 million laptop computers will cost Toshiba Corp. about $1 
billion. But some analysts say the deal may also threaten its 
fledgling revival plan and possibly its brand image. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese electronics manufacturer said Friday that it had  
reached a preliminary settlement in a class-action lawsuit filed in 
March by two U.S. users of Toshiba portable computers who said the 
floppy-disk drive controllers are faulty, distorting or losing 
information written onto disks. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which leads the U.S. laptop computer market, said  
that by settling, it did not admit legal liability or even 
acknowledge the possibility of a defect in its notebook computers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Toshiba is not aware of any instance in which one of our  
computer owners has experienced data loss or data corruption under 
the circumstances described in the lawsuit, and we were prepared to 
vigorously defend the lawsuit,'' the company said in a statement 
from Irvine, Calif., where it has U.S. operations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Toshiba also believed it risked an even greater loss,  
perhaps as much as $9.5 billion, if the case had gone to trial. It 
also risked damage to its brand image. 
</P>
<P>
	``This solution is a bitter pill for us to swallow,'' Toshiba  
president Taizo Nishimuro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement includes promises of partial rebates and coupons  
that can be exchanged for new Toshiba computer products to 
compensate the owners. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5 million computers affected by the settlement represent  
nearly all Toshiba laptops shipped to the United States since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Toshiba said it was slashing its work force by about  
5,000 people, or nearly 8 percent, because of dismal earnings 
prospects. And analysts say Toshiba needs to do more if it hopes to 
grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the cost of the deal may extend beyond a hit to  
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Settlement losses could slow Toshiba's efforts to restructure  
and transform itself into a growth company,'' said Hitoshi Shin, an 
analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan in Tokyo. ``There is the risk that 
the image of Toshiba PCs will suffer in terms of reliability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Steve Meyers, an analyst with Jardine Fleming in Tokyo,  
predicted that any image problem will be minimal: ``The message to 
a buyer of a Toshiba product is that you are going to be 
compensated if there is a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement still requires approval by the U.S. District  
Court in Beaumont, Texas, where the lawsuit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the settlement, Toshiba will start incorporating as  
of Nov. 8 new floppy disk controllers in PCs for sale in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement, owners of Toshiba laptops will be eligible  
for remedial software or new hardware and coupons ranging from $100 
to $225 for Toshiba products. 
</P>
<P>
	Buyers with a valid warranty on laptops bought on or after March  
5, 1998 can also get a partial cash rebate based on the age of 
their machine. The rebates could be several hundred dollars and 
owners will be able to keep the computers, Toshiba said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toshiba spokeswoman Midori Suzuki said details on where  
consumers can seek rebates have not been worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Toshiba revised its earnings forecast for the  
fiscal year ending March 31, 2000 to a group loss of $476 million -- 
more than triple its earlier prediction of a $143 million loss. 
</P>
<P>
	It said it hoped to offset some of the losses from the  
settlement by selling securities holdings.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Pursuer To Indict Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The Spanish judge who wants to put former  
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on trial for alleged human 
rights abuses is about to indict 100 Argentine military officers, a 
lawyer close to the case said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Baltasar Garzon is working on the final details of an  
indictment charging the officers with terrorism, genocide and 
torture, Spanish attorney Enrique Santiago confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Garzon is expected to issue arrest warrants for many of the  
suspects, including members of the military juntas that ruled 
Argentina from 1976 to 1983, as well as military chiefs implicated 
in alleged abuses, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Departing Argentine President Carlos Menem last year issued a  
decree blocking cooperation with Garzon's judicial probe into human 
rights abuses in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment was expected to run to 300 pages, Santiago said.  
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer, who works closely with Garzon's judicial  
investigations, said he thought the judge would not seek 
extraditions from Argentina because of opposition from the 
Argentine government. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an empty gesture,'' Santiago said.  
</P>
<P>
	Menem also said he would boycott next month's Ibero-American  
summit in Havana in solidarity with the Chilean government's 
opposition to Garzon's attempt to put Gen. Pinochet on trial for 
abuses during his 1973-1990 dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet was arrested over a year ago in London and remains in  
British police custody pending resolution of Garzon's extradition 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	Argentina, unlike other South American countries, put its former  
military leaders on trial after democracy was restored in 1983, and 
sentenced them to life in prison in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem pardoned them five years later. A loophole in the amnesty  
law has allowed a resurgence of cases against officers accused of 
kidnapping babies born to women killed during what is known as the 
``dirty war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Argentine government report said at least 9,000 people who  
disappeared during the military regime are presumed dead. Some 
human rights groups estimate the figure is closer to 30,000.

<HEADLINE> Georgia, Florida in SEC Showdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- History, tradition and old wounds that  
haven't healed. 
</P>
<P>
	All will play a role in Saturday's game between Florida and  
Georgia. And most of that baggage has at least something to do with 
the Southeastern Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 95-year history of the storied rivalry, No. 5 Florida  
(6-1, 4-1 SEC) never has won the SEC without beating No. 10 Georgia 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all of those losses are distant memories. In 1997, the  
Bulldogs (6-1, 4-1) snapped their seven-game losing streak in the 
series to knock Florida out of title contention. 
</P>
<P>
	When they renew the series at Alltel Stadium -- capping a week  
known as ``The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party -- the stakes 
will be the same as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is not like every other game,'' Florida receiver  
Darrell Jackson said. ``Those guys beat up on us a couple years 
ago. It hurt us a lot. We were getting ready for an SEC title. That 
loss broke all our dreams and hurt our hearts. We knew we were the 
better team and we didn't play like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since he became Florida's coach in 1990, Steve Spurrier always  
has emphasized winning the SEC over everything else. That earns a 
ring, even if the national title is out of reach. That's what has 
replaced a void with a legacy at Florida over the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two years, Florida has missed out on a trip to  
Atlanta to play in the SEC title game. A victory over Georgia would 
almost guarantee the Gators a trip back, assuming they don't slip 
up against Vanderbilt or South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	To Spurrier, a shot at the SEC is just as important as revenge  
or healing the wounds from the memorable 27-10 loss in 1966, when 
he was quarterback and the Bulldogs ruined his best chance at 
winning a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all know the situation we're in, we're all looking forward  
to it,'' said Spurrier, who is seeking his 100th victory at 
Florida. ``We're all extra up for it because we know so much is at 
stake for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, no player leaves a meeting during Georgia week  
without a lesson in what this game has meant in the past. Although 
Florida has recently dominated this series, winning eight of nine, 
there was an earlier 25-year period in which Florida went 8-17. 
That stretch is what defined the series to alumni, coaches and fans 
who have been around a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a bunch of coaches on our team who played here when  
Georgia beat them and knocked them out of championships,'' 
linebacker Eugene McCaslin said. ``Not only do we play for 
ourselves, but we play for our coaches and family and friends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with a victory, Georgia would need help to contend for the  
title. Because the Bulldogs lost to Tennessee, the Vols would take 
control of the SEC East if Georgia wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, spoiling an archrival's season still means something  
when it's Georgia-Florida. It also would validate Georgia's season, 
which has been marred by the loss to Tennessee, and by a couple of 
one-point victories in which the Bulldogs didn't dominate the way 
they were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to show everybody in the country we can play a top  
five team and that we deserve to be in the top 10,'' freshman wide 
receiver Terrence Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are always a couple of steps higher for the  
Georgia-Florida game.''

<HEADLINE> Lockheed Martin President Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Lockheed Martin Corp. president and chief  
operating officer Peter B. Teets announced his retirement today, 
blaming himself for a disappointing financial outlook for the next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense conglomerate slashed its earnings estimate for the  
year 2000 to $1 a share from $2.15. 
</P>
<P>
	``The difficult times we have seen are not indicative of the  
company's real potential and I feel I must step up to being 
accountable for our disappointing financial outlook for 2000,'' 
Teets said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wall Street was unforgiving. Lockheed shares dropped $4.93 3/4,  
or 21.5 percent, , to $18 a share in morning trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said its space business had weakened due to concerns  
over a series of recent rocket failures, leaving Lockheed with a 
reduced number of launches and opportunities for future launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed's board is calling for a series of measures, including  
changes in the company's senior-management ranks to boost 
shareholder confidence after a disappointing year for the No. 1 
defense contractor in terms of sales, The Wall Street Journal 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The company suffered four launch failures between August 1998  
and last April, and lost a long-held satellite contract reportedly 
valued at $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the company announced a major restructuring,  
including a corporate reorganization, changes in top management and 
the sale of eight business with combined revenues of $1.4 billion 
and employ 9,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	For the third-quarter of 1999, Lockheed reported net earnings of  
$217 million or 57 cents a share down from $318 million or 83 cents 
a share in the same period a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Patient Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                           *By SONYA ROSS    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The regulations President Clinton is offering  
to bar health care providers from revealing medical records without 
a patient's permission apply only to computerized records, leaving 
those on paper unprotected unless Congress acts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You owe the American people a comprehensive medical privacy  
law,'' Clinton appealed to lawmakers Friday while announcing the 
proposed new federal rules. ``Every American has a right to know 
his or her medical records are protected at all times from falling 
into the wrong hands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Existing laws protecting medical privacy vary widely from state  
to state. Currently, there are no federal prohibitions on passing 
private medical information to employers and around insurance 
company offices, or selling them to pharmaceutical companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's proposal would apply to all electronic medical records  
and to all health plans, bringing them on par with other protected 
records, such as video rentals, bank transactions, credit reports 
and driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	But not for at least another two years. The administration will  
publish the proposal next week for review. It then has until 
February 2000 to issue a final proposal, and the regulations would 
not take effect until 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have worked very hard to do what common sense and common  
decency says should have been done a long time ago,'' said Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress actually required Shalala to come up with the proposed  
regulations Clinton announced Friday in a law three years ago if 
lawmakers did not meet a self-imposed Aug. 21 deadline for 
legislating new protections. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed regulations do not apply to paper documents, a  
situation that only Congress can fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., chairman of the Senate Health,  
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said Clinton's proposal 
shows the need for further legislation. For example, psychiatrists' 
notes still remain vulnerable to unauthorized dissemination, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my intention to continue to work on legislation to give  
patients and their health records the true privacy protection they 
deserve,'' Jeffords said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said marketers and employers are the biggest  
exploiters of unauthorized access to medical records. He cited a 
survey of Fortune 500 companies which said more than a third of 
them look at patient medical records before hiring or promoting an 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans have a right to expect that their medical records  
will be used only for their intended purpose, to help doctors 
provide the best medical care possible,'' said Barry Steinhard, 
associate director of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
``President Clinton's regulations promise that people will not have 
to worry that their medical records will be used for other reasons, 
like becoming a marketing tool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One Pennsylvania-based company discovered a worker was  
HIV-positive through such a practice. Clinton called the situation 
a ``nightmare scenario'' that seemed straight out of George 
Orwell's novel ``1984,'' in which a character named Big Brother 
monitored people's activities without their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am determined to put an end to such violations of privacy,''  
the president said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new federal rules would go beyond the weaker protections of  
some states, but would not override those with more restrictive 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, doctors, hospitals or health plans must have  
written consent before releasing a patient's information for 
purposes unrelated to treatment and payment. 
</P>
<P>
	When required to release medical information, health  
organizations would have to limit the disclosure to the minimum 
necessary for each case. For example, banks or credit card 
companies could not gain access to treatment information when 
handling payments for medical services. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal would create new civil and criminal penalties for  
improperly disclosing patient information. Intentionally releasing 
information would be punishable by a fine of up to $50,000 and one 
year in jail. Someone convicted of trying to sell information could 
face a $250,000 fine and 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients also would be given the right to see and copy their  
medical records and to request corrections of any errors. 
</P>
<P>
	And law enforcement organizations would be prohibited from  
obtaining medical records without legal authorization such as a 
warrant or court order. This retreats from the administration's 
previous position of allowing law enforcement unfettered access to 
health records. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also would require health care providers to send  
patients a notice describing how they use electronic medical 
information and advise patients in advance of any changes.

<HEADLINE> Teacher Tapes Cat Feces To Desk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JOPLIN, Mo. (AP) -- An elementary school teacher says she was  
just being funny when she taped a bag containing cat feces to the 
desk of a misbehaving student. 
</P>
<P>
	But the boy's mother isn't laughing. She wants the teacher  
suspended and her children transferred to a new school. 
</P>
<P>
	She says the boy has received several threatening letters,  
including one that appeared to be smeared with feces. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing has gotten way out of hand,'' said Stephanie  
England, mother of 11-year-old Preston. 
</P>
<P>
	The flap began last week when Preston told his Jefferson  
Elementary school classmates to ``suck a turd,'' his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, teacher Diane Parker taped a bag of cat feces to  
Preston's desk and made him sit next to it for more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Superintendent Vernon Hudson said the school was taking steps to  
deal with the situation, but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been fine if she had just sent home a letter  
saying my son was mouthing off in class, but instead she went ahead 
with this ridiculous punishment,'' Ms. England said. ``This whole 
thing stinks.''

<HEADLINE> Judge: Case Can Revisit SLA History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The history of the Symbionese Liberation Army  
is fair game for prosecutors seeking to convict a woman on 
24-year-old attempted murder charges from her days in the 1970s 
radical leftist group, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said past crimes attributed to the SLA would be  
relevant, even though Sara Jane Olson has claimed she is being 
tried for all the crimes of the group, not just the charges that 
she planted bombs under police cars in 1975. The device did not 
explode. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems we are going to have the whole history of the  
Symbionese Liberation Army in California put on in this 
courtroom,'' Superior Court Judge James Ideman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the prosecutors made clear they will try to show  
``she should have known what she was getting involved in'' when she 
joined up. 
</P>
<P>
	The group is best known for the February 1974 kidnapping of  
Patty Hearst, though earlier members of the group were convicted of 
killing Oakland schools chief Marcus Foster. There were also a 
series of bank robberies in Northern California. Olson is not 
charged with any of those crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson, formerly Kathleen Ann Soliah, was not associated with  
the SLA when the group abducted Ms. Hearst from her Berkeley 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Susan Jordan said that including the group's  
history would drag the trial out a year. Prosecutors disputed that. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson was indicted in 1976 and was a fugitive until June, when  
she was arrested in St. Paul, Minn., after being featured on TV's 
``America's Most Wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olson was present for the proceeding but did not speak.

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach Grievance Dismissed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- A grievance filed against  
renowned figure skating coach Richard Callaghan for sexual 
misconduct and exploitation has been dismissed by the Professional 
Skaters Association. 
</P>
<P>
	PSA president Gerry Lane said Friday a three-member committee  
charged with examining claims by Craig Maurizi, a former student 
and colleague of Callaghan, unanimously found no violation of the 
ethics standards of the organization. The PSA certifies coaching in 
American figure skating, but coaches do not have to join. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy with the decision,'' Callaghan said. ``However, no  
decision can really compensate for the damage it has done my 
reputation and the grief these allegations caused my wife and 
daughter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi charged in April that Callaghan, who coached Tara  
Lipinski to an Olympic gold medal and Todd Eldredge to five U.S. 
championships and a world title, made improper advances to him when 
he was 15. Maurizi said Callaghan abused his authority three years 
later to initiate a full sexual relationship, which continued for 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	While the U.S. Figure Skating Association dismissed Maurizi's  
complaint in June, the PSA gathered information from Maurizi, 
Callaghan and any witnesses. The committee then determined ``a 
standard of proof by clear and convincing evidence was not met to 
support the grievance,'' according to a PSA statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank the PSA for conducting the grievance procedure in a  
timely and professional manner,'' Maurizi said. ``I am a member and 
am proud to be a member of the PSA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not really surprised. From the first day I decided to  
come forward with my story, I knew I probably waited too long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi's grievance was dismissed by the USFSA because it said  
he waited too long to file it. A complaint had to be filed within 
60 days of the alleged violation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope I gave the PSA and the USFSA a wakeup call by telling  
my story,'' Maurizi said. ``They are great organizations, but in 
this area they are very lacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he hoped the USFSA would establish a detailed sexual  
abuse policy similar to that of the Canadian federation. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi currently coaches in Marlborough, Mass.  
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan left the Detroit Skating Club soon after the  
allegations and now is coaching in Rochester, Mich. He has six 
students, including Angela Nikodinov, ranked third in the United 
States, and Eldredge. He is here with Nikodinov for Skate America.

<HEADLINE> NYC Salutes World Champion Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- George Steinbrenner hoisted a broom from a  
parade float. Darryl Strawberry broke down in tears. And millions 
of fans staged another Broadway revival with a blizzard of 
confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	``This stuff never gets old,'' New York Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said at a City Hall rally after the parade Friday. ``This one 
seemed even better. I think you appreciate it more each time you do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the Yankees' third title -- and third parade -- in the  
last four years. A half-dozen floats carried the players, eliciting 
wild screams and chants of ``Let's go Yankees!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir generously estimated the crowd  
at 3.6 million, topping the crowds for the 1996 and 1998 parades. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day that felt more like spring, designated hitter Chili  
Davis puffed on a victory cigar. Strawberry videotaped the roaring, 
face-painted crowd and then cried at a City Hall rally presided 
over by the city's most prominent Yankees fan, Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who withstood colon cancer and legal problems this  
season, was overcome with emotion as he acknowledged his manager. 
Torre embraced him until the outfielder composed himself and said, 
``Thank you for caring for me, and I love you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Series MVP Mariano Rivera, the unhittable reliever, had a  
float all to himself. Yogi Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher, paraded 
in a vintage car. And Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, rode in the 
top of a double-decker bus, brandishing a broom in tribute to his 
team's sweep of the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling to win in front of you fans,'' said  
shortstop Derek Jeter, with yet another World Series ring. ``With 
the exception of Yogi, everyone has a few more fingers to fill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone paid homage to the Yankee family -- Torre, whom he  
called the team's ``father,'' coach Don Zimmer, the ``crazy 
uncle,'' and Steinbrenner, whom he referred to as ``the very 
wealthy, eccentric grandfather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five minutes before the parade's noon start, fans were  
lined six and seven deep on the sidewalks along the financial 
district's narrow streets. There was no official estimate on the 
size of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The route, from the Battery to City Hall, is less than a mile.  
Many revelers never even caught a glimpse of the festivities. The 
crowd around City Hall, where each player received a key to the 
city, stretched several blocks to the Brooklyn Bridge at the 
parade's height. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeter for mayor,'' read one sign along the route, and the  
25-year-old shortstop was clearly the most valuable player to many 
of the young women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to marry him one day,'' said Melissa Grimsley,  
16. She and friend JoAnna DelVecchio wore Jeter jerseys and ditched 
school for the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't the only students taking the day off. High school  
attendance was down about 17 percent from an average day, the Board 
of Education said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were six arrests during the parade. One man was accused of  
igniting small fire in the ankle-deep paper along the street. A 
woman was charged with indecent exposure for appearing topless on a 
balcony above the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	At the City Hall ceremony, Yankee Stadium organist Eddie Layton  
played, and country musician Clint Black performed a song with 
special lyrics honoring the champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone, a potential free agent, was serenaded was a chant of ``One  
more year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How about two more years?'' Cone asked.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's administration was less gracious toward Democratic  
state assembly members who voted to repeal New York's commuter tax 
-- a move that cost the city an estimated $210 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said the invitations were rescinded to  
send a message: Don't vote against the city's interests. 
Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a Yankees fan from upstate, said he took 
away this message: ``He puts the rude in Rudy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this was not a day for politics.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're making this a yearly tradition!'' shouted Charlie Hine,  
a UPS employee from Connecticut who skipped work for the second 
straight year to cheer his team. ``We'll be back next year!''

<HEADLINE> FBI Probes Animal Researcher Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- FBI officials hope DNA evidence will be found  
on razor-lined envelopes mailed to 88 animal researchers in 13 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	The letters were mailed from Las Vegas earlier this month, said  
Americans for Medical Progress, a group that monitors the work of 
universities that have research facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI offices nationwide were retrieving the letters from  
recipients and mailing them to the Las Vegas office, agent Kevin 
Caudle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The office will process the envelopes, then forward them to FBI  
laboratories in Washington. Authorities are hopeful the envelopes 
will yield DNA, saliva or fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's domestic violence unit is handling the case,  
working with the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The blades are taped to the inside flap of the envelope so if  
you open them and put your hand in, it would cut you,'' Caudle said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	An enclosed letter gives scientists one year to abandon their  
research or ``your violence will be turned back upon you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 88 recipients had been identified in a communique from a  
group calling itself the ``Justice Department,'' said Jacquie 
Calnan, president of the watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
	The terrorist group started in England in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
	The FBI announced Wednesday that it was investigating the  
mailings. The envelopes were postmarked from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	States where researchers were targeted include Alabama,  
California, Georgia, Illinois, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, 
Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Tennessee, Washington and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Remington Track Sale Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- MI Venture is studying whether night racing  
would make economic sense at the Remington Park horse race track it 
is purchasing from the DeBartolo Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	MI Venture, a Delaware subsidiary of Toronto-based automotive  
parts giant Magna International Inc., is to take over ownership 
when the deal is completed in about two weeks. MI Venture is 
chaired by racehorse owner Frank Stronach. 
</P>
<P>
	James Nicol, vice president of Magna International, said  
Remington was chosen to help fill a midwestern void for the 
company. Remington is the fourth recent acquisition for MI Venture. 
Santa Anita and Gulfstream Park are also owned by the company and 
Thistledown near Cleveland was part of Thursday's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel Oklahoma racing would be attractive with lights;  
Remington is a perfect fit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicol said the company will maintain the current Remington  
management. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oklahoma Horse Racing Commission gave conditional approval  
of the acquisition Thursday during a special meeting. The sale will 
be final once a routine background investigation into MI Venture is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales price for the 11-year-old track wasn't disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	With the sales of Remington and Thistledown, the DeBartolo Corp.  
is down to only Louisiana Downs in Bossier City, La. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have funneled down to one entity, and we'll continue to  
operate it since we have slot machine approval,'' said Tim Kaple, 
vice president of racing operations. ``We are in the process of 
developing some property. We are not out of racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale of Remington has been rumored or almost happened  
several times in recent years. The track has steadily lost business 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
	The track's current season ends Dec. 5. The Horse Racing  
Commission approved 2000 dates of 16 days of thoroughbreds from 
Feb. 5 through March 31, 40 days of quarter horses from April 1 
through June 10 and 67 days of thoroughbreds from Aug. 5 through 
Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicol said MI Venture plans to keep the assigned dates and has  
no immediate plans to eliminate quarter horse racing.

<HEADLINE> Sunday Inspires Halloween Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With Halloween falling on a Sunday this year, many communities  
are holding trick-or-treating on Saturday night instead, in some 
cases because they don't want youngsters dressing up as demons on 
the Lord's day. 
</P>
<P>
	Some communities cite the conflict with the Sabbath. Others note  
that Sunday is a school night or that daylight-saving time ends at 
2 a.m. Sunday, meaning darkness will fall an hour earlier than on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already have Sunday observed for someone,'' said Kenny  
Clemons, mayor of Gardendale, Ala., who is urging residents to mark 
the holiday Saturday. ``That's the Lord's day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake City, celebrations haven't been officially banned  
on Sunday, though the Mormon Church is asking people to pick 
another day. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city where more than 70 percent of the population is  
Mormon, that doesn't leave much choice, according to Stephanie 
Homaechevarria. When she tried to take her children 
trick-or-treating in 1993, the last time Halloween fell on Sunday, 
she and her 3-year-old were snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of 10 houses, only one would open their door to us,'' Ms.  
Homaechevarria said. 
</P>
<P>
	Confusion reigns in Arizona, where officials in Mesa,  
Scottsdale, Gilbert and Fountain Hills have gotten calls seeking 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess there's a lot of conflict because of people's  
religious holidays,'' said Amy Silverman, Fountain Hills youth and 
teen services coordinator. ``Or people like to go to church on 
Sunday and they don't like to go trick or treating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago suburb of Harvey moved trick-or-treating to  
Saturday, as did the Missouri towns of Fayette and Boonville, and 
Noblesville, Ind., near Indianapolis. Birmingham and Huntsville, 
Ala., also prefer Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities are deciding not to even get involved. Vestavia  
Hills, Ala., Mayor Pat Reynolds learned his lesson when he moved 
the holiday to Saturday six years ago. ``It was utter chaos,'' he 
said. ``I got chewed up one side and down the other. This time, I'm 
staying out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The confusion is fine with some trick-or-treaters.  
</P>
<P>
	Nine-year-old Michael Nichols of Marietta, Ga., figures he will  
get extra use from his Star Wars costume. On Saturday, he will hit 
a church event. Then, he said, ``I'll go around the neighborhood 
Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Big Waves in Pacific Kill Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A huge storm that pounded the West Coast  
has left 15-foot swells in its wake after tearing down docks, 
flooding homes and leaving two dead, including a bride who was 
swept to sea as she and her newlywed husband took photos. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman was swept into the ocean by 25-foot waves near Pacific  
Grove on Thursday afternoon. Her husband jumped in after her, and 
both were plucked from the water off Lover's Point 15 minutes later 
by rescuers in a boat. 
</P>
<P>
	The husband survived but the woman was dead within minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to run from it, but it got them,'' said A.J. Young,  
who was watching and immediately called 911 on his cell phone. The 
husband and wife weren't identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed was a 20-year-old surfer, Danny Jordan, near Santa  
Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have 20-foot swells and 25-foot waves, we have  
vicious rip tides,'' said Owen Miller, a Capitola Fire Department 
battalion chief. ``It sounds like he was knocked around pretty 
heavily by incoming waves and wasn't able to recover.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The swirling storm, 600 to 800 miles in diameter, sat off the  
coast for at least a day before moving toward land Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The big waves hit the coasts of Washington and Oregon before  
dawn then began slamming the Northern California coast near 
Capitola. 
</P>
<P>
	Feared lost was an unidentified man who was last seen Wednesday  
on a 40-foot sailboat that lost a mast in high seas and heavy winds 
about 560 miles off the Pacific Coast. Two Coast Guard vessels, one 
equipped with a helicopter, were expected to reach the scene by 
Saturday to continue the search. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard had no information on where the sailboat had  
originated or how many people may be on board, said Petty Officer 
Veronica Bandrowsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful waves, which reached 40 feet in parts of Northern  
California, lured spectators to the shores. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was not just surf,'' said Santa Cruz harbor port director  
Brian Foss. ``This was a surge, a huge pulse in the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It destroyed boats and forced driftwood onto the streets of  
Monterey. Water, mud and seaweed covered famous 17-Mile Drive in 
Pebble Beach. The ocean topped the Capitola sea wall, forcing 
wharf, restaurant and hotel evacuations.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Receive $8.7M Purse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson got his money, and a one-way ticket  
out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada boxing regulators decided Friday not to punish Tyson for  
hitting Orlin Norris after the bell in the first round of their 
aborted fight, voting unanimously to release the $8.7 million purse 
they had been holding since the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	But commissioners warned that Tyson will have a tough time  
getting a new boxing license when his expires Dec. 31, and 
suggested he to find another place to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``My advice is to pack Mike Tyson's bags up and take this act on  
the road,'' commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta said. ``I'm not so sure 
we need him in the state of Nevada any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly frustrated at having to deal with Tyson outside the ring  
once more, commissioners spent little time at the 30-minute hearing 
going over the circumstances surrounding the premature ending of 
last Saturday's fight between Tyson and Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they tried to send a message that Nevada would not  
tolerate rules being broken in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not prepared to have any hoodlums fight in the state of  
Nevada,'' commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson did not appear at the hearing, which was in sharp contrast  
to the lengthy proceedings a year ago that won him the right to box 
again after being banned from the sport for biting Evander 
Holyfield's ears. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Dan Goossen told commissioners that he also thought it  
was a good idea for Tyson to fight elsewhere, at least for awhile. 
Goossen said plans were underway to do just that, even before the 
latest incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking to take Mike out of the state of Nevada and go  
other places including out of the country,'' Goossen said. ``Those 
plans are still on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson tentatively is scheduled to fight Shannon Briggs Feb. 26  
at Madison Square Garden. He also may fight before that, possibly 
on Dec. 11, against an unnamed opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's handlers are reportedly also trying to arrange a fight  
in England or Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's hearing, The Nevada Athletic Commission upheld  
referee Richard Steele's action of deducting two points from Tyson 
as the sole punishment for hitting Norris after the bell at the end 
of the first round of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris fell, dislocated his knee and was unable to continue.  
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners could have fined Tyson or they could have changed  
the decision from a no contest to a disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately on occasion boxers get hit after the bell,''  
Tyson manager Shelly Finkel said later. ``Mike is pleased to put 
this ordeal behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's boxing license in Nevada expires Dec. 31, and  
commissioners warned Tyson's representatives that he will have a 
difficult time getting licensed again. They suggested he have some 
fights elsewhere to show he can learn to obey the rules of the 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``He particularly seems to have trouble right at the end of the  
round,'' commissioner James Nave said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ghanem said the commission was worried about Tyson's actions  
both against Norris and in January when he twisted Francois Botha's 
arm at the end of the first round of their fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to watch him closely,'' Ghanem said. ``But I don't  
think he'll ask to fight here for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's ruling in the ring that the left hook that dropped  
Norris after the bell sounded was not deliberate was the key factor 
in Tyson avoiding any penalties for the late blow, which ended the 
fight when Norris dislocated his knee on the way down to the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made the call right there and the call was appropriate,''  
commissioner Glen Carano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners voted 4-0 to give Tyson back the $8.7 million  
purse that was withheld when the fight ended in confusion after 
Norris could not go on. Norris got his $201,000 purse the night of 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson attorney Jim Jimmerson noted that no other fights had been  
disciplined outside the ring for hitting after the bell. He brought 
up Felix Trinidad as an example, noting Trinidad hit Oscar De La 
Hoya after the bell twice during their welterweight unification 
bout and was not even penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the heat of the moment, the intensity of the moment,''  
Jimmerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson said after the fight that he did not hear the bell, even  
though it rang five times as Steele moved in to try and separate 
the fighters in the middle of the ring.

<HEADLINE> Navy Probes Blue Angels' Jet Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOODY AIR FORCE BASE, Ga. (AP) -- Investigators are examining the  
wreckage of a Navy Blue Angels jet to determine why its landing 
approach during a clear noon hour ended in a stand of pines, 
killing its two crewmen. 
</P>
<P>
	The F/A-18 Hornet crashed during a training flight on Thursday  
on a farm about three miles north of Moody Air Force Base in 
southern Georgia. The precision flying team canceled a performance 
at Moody this weekend and planned to return today to its home base 
in Pensacola, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team is obviously in mourning right now,'' Cmdr. Jack  
Papp, a Navy spokesman in Pensacola, said today. ``The town here in 
Pensacola is grieving too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Papp said two Naval investigators arrived at Moody late Thursday  
and were examining the wreckage today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said the Navy would search  
aggressively for any procedural or maintenance problems that could 
have caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is its premier flying team, a team that performs to the  
amazement and pleasure of crowds all over the United States,'' 
Bacon said. ``You can be sure the Navy will do whatever it can to 
make sure that this team is at the very top of its ability to 
fly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Killed in the crash were Lt. Commander Kieron O'Connor, 35, of  
Burtonsville, Md., and Lt. Kevin Colling, 32, of Castle Rock, 
Colo., said their flight leader, Cmdr. Patrick Driscoll. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor had been with the 14-member team since last November,  
while Colling had joined recently and was being trained, Driscoll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had the privilege of flying with both these pilots in the  
fleet,'' Driscoll said. ``They are two of the best naval aviators I 
know. This is a tragic loss to the families, to the Blue Angels and 
the U.S. Navy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor was profiled in a recent issue of ``The World of  
Hibernia,'' a magazine about Ireland and the Irish around the 
world. He recalled watching the precision aviators as a child. 
Joining the team was a ``dream,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I first saw the Blue Angels when I was only 8 years old. I  
still recall what watching them perform did for me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The flying team, based in Pensacola, Fla., has six F-18 Hornets  
that execute high-speed acrobatics. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the crash, the jets were not in formation and  
were circling to practice arrival procedures as the pilots 
familiarized themselves with the terrain, Driscoll said. The jet 
that crashed was in the vicinity of another, but not as close as 
the aircraft usually fly during performances, Driscoll said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Cooper, a 55-year-old farmer, said he heard the crash from  
his home about a half-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought maybe one got a little fast and went through the  
sound barrier,'' Cooper said. ``About five or 10 minutes later, I 
went out back smelled smoke. It set the woods on fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, President Clinton mourned the two pilots, saying  
their deaths are ``a loss that we all share.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Including Thursday's deaths, 23 Blue Angels pilots have been  
killed in air shows or in training. 
</P>
<P>
	The last crash was in 1990. The last death was in 1985, in  
Niagara Falls, N.Y. Lt. Cmdr. Michael Gershon was killed when two 
planes collided during an air show.

<HEADLINE> Texas County Pulls Arts Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONGVIEW, Texas (AP) -- Commissioners in a Texas county have  
voted to pull $50,000 in funding for a summer Shakespeare festival 
at a public college that recently staged a play about 
homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gregg County commissioners said they revoked the grant this  
week because it cannot give tax money to anything that doesn't 
``render a value back to the county,'' said Commissioner Charles 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Festival director Raymond Caldwell said the action was merely  
punitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is very cowardly, I think it is very despicable,''  
Caldwell said. ``I'm just shocked that they are so small-minded 
that they can't see what they are doing. They are cutting off their 
nose to spite their face.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Kilgore College's theater department staged  
``Angels in America, Part 1: Millennium Approaches,'' a Pulitzer 
Prize-winning play that traces the lives of five gay Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of residents signed a petition against the play, and  
city officials threatened to take back a $15,000 donation to the 
theater department. 
</P>
<P>
	Kilgore College President Bill Holda said he disagreed with the  
commissioners' decision and noted the Shakespeare Festival is a 
separate entity from the college's theater department.

<HEADLINE> Knicks' Sprewell Accepts Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell thought it over and  
decided he'd like to stick around the New York Knicks for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell has decided to take the Knicks long-term contract  
extension of $61.9 million for five years. The team also had a 
two-year, $21 million offer on the table. 
</P>
<P>
	For a time, it seemed Sprewell would accept the two-year deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think if I had taken the two-year, I would have been  
wondering if it was the right thing,'' Sprewell said. ``In the back 
of my mind I would have been thinking, `Let's stay healthy.' I just 
want to go out and play and not worry about being healthy because 
my contract is up in a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy with the numbers in the five-year deal. I feel more  
secure with that. That's what I feel more comfortable with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell, 29, was fined $30,000 and suspended for one game,  
losing $100,000 in salary when he missed a week of training camp in 
Charleston, S.C., while he drove across the country. He also was 
fined $25,000 by the team earlier this year for comments made by 
his agent, Robert Gist, but that money was reportedly later 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be paid $9 million this season, the final year of the  
four-year deal he signed with Golden State in 1996. He was 
suspended for much of the 1997 season, losing more than $6 million 
in salary, after choking coach P.J. Carlesimo, and was traded to 
the Knicks before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	His new contract, which includes an opt-out clause after four  
years, will take effect next season.

<HEADLINE> Contaminated Hot Dogs Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal authorities are investigating whether  
contaminated hog dogs are to blame for two deaths and at least six 
illnesses. More than 2 million pounds of frankfurters have been 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Hot dogs made at a Bronx factory and distributed nationally were  
recalled after listeria, a food-borne bacteria, was found. The 
plant makes hot dogs sold under the brands Sabrett's and Western 
Beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria found in an unopened package of Sabrett's hot dogs  
appeared to be similar to a strain of bacteria found in eight 
patients in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Georgia and Rhode Island, said 
spokesman Tom Skinner of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the eight have died. Skinner said the CDC had not  
confirmed that hot dogs caused the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Marathon Enterprises Inc. closed its plant and recalled about  
52,000 pounds of hot dogs on Oct. 13. It expanded the recall 
Tuesday to 2.1 million pounds of frankfurters bearing the code EST 
8854 inside the USDA seal of inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	``The actions that the CDC is taking are part of their normal,  
routine procedure in any inquiry,'' said Marathon spokeswoman 
Courtenay Higgins. ``Right now, it's inappropriate to conclude that 
it's directly linked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Western Beef spokeswoman Selma Gore said the company has  
switched to another manufacturer for its frankfurters.

<HEADLINE> Bush Defends N.H. Debate Absence </HEADLINE>

<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W.  
Bush on Friday continued to defend his absence from a debate with 
his rivals a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will take part in debates,'' the Texas governor said at his  
residence as he greeted and took pictures with a parade of 
elementary school students dressed for Halloween. '' I think the

	He plans to participate in a GOP debate in Manchester, N.H., on  
Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the most important thing is I won my wife's  
affection,'' Bush said. ``The event in New Hampshire was important. 
It wasn't nearly as important as for me to be by her side and I'm 
glad I was there last night.''

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Recasner Out for 6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets guard Eldridge Recasner  
will miss at least the first six weeks of the regular season with a 
broken shoulder and collapsed lung after an accident in which 
teammate Derrick Coleman was charged with driving while 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Recasner was not listed as a patient at Carolinas Medical Center  
on Friday, a spokeswoman said. Another passenger in Coleman's 1996 
Land Rover at the time of the wreck early Wednesday, Ebony 
Kimbrough, was in good condition at the hospital Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman was charged after the collision with a grocery store  
delivery truck. Coleman did not travel with the Hornets on Friday 
night for an exhibition game against Chicago in Chapel Hill. Team 
officials attributed Coleman's absence to soreness. 
</P>
<P>
	Recasner was in the passenger seat of Coleman's vehicle when  
Coleman apparently tried to make a left turn in front of the 
oncoming truck. The passenger side took the brunt of the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're probably looking at him being out six weeks at least  
now,'' Hornets executive vice president Bob Bass said Thursday. 
``But that's not that bad when you consider he could have easily 
died in that crash. We're thankful it's not worse than it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No surgery is planned for Recasner's shoulder, but it will be  
immobilized for some time, Bass said. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman needed stitches to his nose and forehead but was  
released from the hospital early Wednesday. He missed practice 
Thursday with what Bass said was general soreness and swelling to 
his face. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass said he hoped Coleman would be ready for the season opener  
against Orlando on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hornets coach Paul Silas said he hoped the accident would  
encourage changes in Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're dealing with human beings and there are going to be  
problems. But it's something he's going to have to think hard about 
and deal with. If you have a problem -- I'm not necessarily saying 
he does have one -- you've got to admit it and deal with it. There's 
only so much we can do,'' Silas said.

<HEADLINE> Latest Spending Bill Faces Veto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans moved another step toward an  
inevitable budget showdown with President Clinton, passing and 
sending to the Senate the last -- and largest -- spending bill of the 
year in the face of a certain veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've put our mark on it, he'll put his mark on it in the form  
of a veto, and that's when negotiations really start,'' House 
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said Thursday 
after the House passed a huge bill to fund the District of Columbia 
and the health and labor departments. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending measure, approved on a near party-line 218-211  
vote, also carried a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut in federal 
agencies' budgets, which Clinton has said he would not accept. 
Senate passage was expected early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the last of the 13 spending bills needed to fund the  
government in fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. Congress already has 
passed and Clinton has signed two short-term measures that have 
kept the government running nearly a month into the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	But neither the Republican-led Congress nor the president was  
ready to let the budget fight produce a federal shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	So Clinton today signed a measure letting federal agencies  
function through Nov. 5 as the two sides work through their 
differences. The House had passed the extension by a 424-2 vote; 
Senate passage was by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Picking his own battles, Clinton acknowledged what has been a  
political fact in Washington for many weeks: That his proposals to 
extend the solvency of Medicare and Social Security, and create a 
new Medicare prescription drug benefit, would have to wait until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they're making a big mistake,'' Clinton said of GOP  
opposition to handling those matters in Congress' few remaining 
weeks of 1999. He added, ``We can come back to all that early next 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans, meanwhile, celebrated a near party line  
passage of the final spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's vote is a victory for the American taxpayer and  
America's seniors,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., as 
dozens of GOP lawmakers gathered on the Capitol's East Lawn amid 
banners and a four-piece jazz band playing, ``Pennies From 
Heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. President, please make the responsible decision for  
American taxpayers and American seniors and sign this important 
bill into law,'' Hastert added. 
</P>
<P>
	There was virtually no chance of that. Clinton stood ready to  
veto the measure because of the damage he said would be caused by 
the across-the-board cuts in all agency budgets, which Republicans 
included to avoid using Social Security money. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also objected when the GOP did not provide the money he  
sought to help communities hire thousands of elementary school 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	The final spending bill contained $314 billion for education,  
labor and health programs for the new fiscal year and $429 million 
for the District of Columbia budget. It included more than Clinton 
wanted for the Job Corps and AIDS treatment, but less than he wants 
for substance abuse and programs for the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was stuffed with scores of home-district projects, such  
as $250,000 for a Philadelphia ballet school to serve poor children 
in southern New Jersey and $2.5 million to train construction 
workers in Fairbanks, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	But in truth, the measure was all about a GOP effort to gain  
leverage in upcoming budget bargaining by letting them assert they 
had finished Congress' spending business without dipping into 
Social Security's surpluses. Those talks will encompass differences 
over the departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and 
other Cabinet level departments, plus dozens of agencies and 
foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the political significance of Social Security, both  
sides produced similar documents from the nonpartisan Congressional 
Budget Office to buttress their cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats distributed a table showing GOP spending bills would  
dip into Social Security for $17 billion. Republicans sent out the 
same table with an additional line showing $18 billion in 
``adjustments'' -- where the GOP ordered the budget office to count 
spending differently -- so that Social Security money would be left 
untouched.

<HEADLINE> Downsizing New to Japanese Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The titans of the Japanese business world used to  
be known for guaranteeing their workers a job for life. Now they 
are quickly earning a reputation for a very different practice: 
downsizing. 
</P>
<P>
	Work force reductions -- once unheard of in prosperous, postwar  
Japan -- have picked up a feverish pace in recent months, with an 
increasing number of top companies announcing cost-cutting plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend is not expected to stop.  
</P>
<P>
	``Restructuring is soon going to be reaching critical mass,''  
predicted Ron Bevacqua, senior economist for Commerz Securities 
(Japan) Co. ``It'll become an irreversible trend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October alone, No. 2 automaker Nissan Motor Co. and  
Mitsubishi Motors Corp. announced sweeping restructuring plans 
centered on job reductions in the thousands. Sumitomo and Sakura 
banks also included hefty cuts as part of their merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Those announcements followed similar plans by electronic giants  
Hitachi, NEC Corp. and Sony Corp. earlier this year. Even former 
state-run monolith Nippon Telegraph &AMP; Telephone Corp. is 
considering extensive cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The downsizing is largely seen as a sign Japanese companies are  
finally facing a troubling reality: The sluggish economy at home 
and the demands of global competition mean they have to cut costs 
to survive. 
</P>
<P>
	In Japan, where gas stations are staffed with legions of  
attendants and top department stores have women who guide you on 
and off elevators, cutting fat in the workplace has become a 
necessary evil. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are recognizing that they are overstaffed,'' said  
Peter Morgan, senior economist for HSBC Securities, Japan. ``That's 
one of the major steps that they have to take in terms of 
restructuring and to try to restore profitability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the cuts are big news in Japan, they are nothing like  
U.S.-style mass layoffs. Japanese companies are still largely 
relying on attrition and hiring freezes and phasing the cuts in 
over several years to make them less painful. 
</P>
<P>
	The trend has yet to have a major impact on unemployment. On  
Friday, the government announced the jobless rate was 4.6 percent 
in September, coming down from the record-high 4.9 percent logged 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The hardships are also being sweetened by generous early  
retirement packages and other incentives. Sony, for example, now 
offers some workers two years' salary if they quit -- on top of 
traditional severance pay. 
</P>
<P>
	The cutting, however, has its dark side.  
</P>
<P>
	Mounting pressure to quit or retire early is rattling the nerves  
of workers who have long expected they had a job for life. Suicides 
last year soared 35 percent, and the uncertainty of corporate 
restructuring was blamed for part of the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Job prospects are also shrinking for the younger generation. A  
survey of top companies by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun financial 
newspaper showed last week that hires next year were expected to 
drop 17.8 percent to the lowest level in six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the government has for the most part accepted  
restructuring as inevitable, the trend is worrying enough for 
officials to publicly warn companies to avoid layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The minister of international trade and industry, Takashi  
Fukaya, urged Nissan recently to study ``natural'' ways of cutting 
its work force -- such as limiting new hires. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies are not talking about minor cuts.  
</P>
<P>
	Troubled Nissan, now 37 percent owned by France's Renault SA, is  
cutting 21,000 employees worldwide -- 16,500 of them in Japan. 
Struggling Mitsubishi Motors, meanwhile, is cutting 9,900 workers. 
NTT is looking at a reduction of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	While the restructuring is largely welcome, some analysts worry  
that the country has been slow in creating a more dynamic economy 
that can move extra workers from established companies to new 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is beginning to recognize the problem. Prime  
Minister Keizo Obuchi said in a policy speech on Friday that 
building up small firms is ``the key to the rebirth of the Japanese 
economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say the plans do not appear to go far enough. They  
call for liberalizing the economy by enforcing the antimonopoly law 
and removing barriers to new entrants to the market. Raising 
venture capital is also relatively difficult in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure to give entrepreneurs a freer hand could lead to greater  
problems down the road, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting the destruction,'' Bevacqua said. ``What I'm  
worried about is we're not going to get enough creation.''

<HEADLINE>  NYC Salutes World Champion Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- George Steinbrenner hoisted a broom from a  
parade float. Darryl Strawberry broke down in tears. And millions 
of fans staged another Broadway revival with a blizzard of 
confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	``This stuff never gets old,'' New York Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said at a City Hall rally after the parade Friday. ``This one 
seemed even better. I think you appreciate it more each time you do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the Yankees' third title -- and third parade -- in the  
last four years. A half-dozen floats carried the players, eliciting 
wild screams and chants of ``Let's go Yankees!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir generously estimated the crowd  
at 3.6 million, topping the crowds for the 1996 and 1998 parades. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day that felt more like spring, designated hitter Chili  
Davis puffed on a victory cigar. Strawberry videotaped the roaring, 
face-painted crowd and then cried at a City Hall rally presided 
over by the city's most prominent Yankees fan, Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who withstood colon cancer and legal problems this  
season, was overcome with emotion as he acknowledged his manager. 
Torre embraced him until the outfielder composed himself and said, 
``Thank you for caring for me, and I love you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Series MVP Mariano Rivera, the unhittable reliever, had a  
float all to himself. Yogi Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher, paraded 
in a vintage car. And Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, rode in the 
top of a double-decker bus, brandishing a broom in tribute to his 
team's sweep of the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling to win in front of you fans,'' said  
shortstop Derek Jeter, with yet another World Series ring. ``With 
the exception of Yogi, everyone has a few more fingers to fill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone paid homage to the Yankee family -- Torre, whom he  
called the team's ``father,'' coach Don Zimmer, the ``crazy 
uncle,'' and Steinbrenner, whom he referred to as ``the very 
wealthy, eccentric grandfather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five minutes before the parade's noon start, fans were  
lined six and seven deep on the sidewalks along the financial 
district's narrow streets. There was no official estimate on the 
size of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The route, from the Battery to City Hall, is less than a mile.  
Many revelers never even caught a glimpse of the festivities. The 
crowd around City Hall, where each player received a key to the 
city, stretched several blocks to the Brooklyn Bridge at the 
parade's height. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeter for mayor,'' read one sign along the route, and the  
25-year-old shortstop was clearly the most valuable player to many 
of the young women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to marry him one day,'' said Melissa Grimsley,  
16. She and friend JoAnna DelVecchio wore Jeter jerseys and ditched 
school for the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	They weren't the only students taking the day off. High school  
attendance was down about 17 percent from an average day, the Board 
of Education said. 
</P>
<P>
	There were six arrests during the parade. One man was accused of  
igniting small fire in the ankle-deep paper along the street. A 
woman was charged with indecent exposure for appearing topless on a 
balcony above the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	At the City Hall ceremony, Yankee Stadium organist Eddie Layton  
played, and country musician Clint Black performed a song with 
special lyrics honoring the champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone, a potential free agent, was serenaded was a chant of ``One  
more year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How about two more years?'' Cone asked.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's administration was less gracious toward Democratic  
state assembly members who voted to repeal New York's commuter tax 
-- a move that cost the city an estimated $210 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said the invitations were rescinded to  
send a message: Don't vote against the city's interests. 
Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a Yankees fan from upstate, said he took 
away this message: ``He puts the rude in Rudy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this was not a day for politics.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're making this a yearly tradition!'' shouted Charlie Hine,  
a UPS employee from Connecticut who skipped work for the second 
straight year to cheer his team. ``We'll be back next year!''

<HEADLINE> Some Ex-Space Chimps Leaving Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Retirement in Florida beckons for 21  
chimpanzee veterans of the space program. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a court settlement with the Air Force, the chimpanzees  
will be moved from a research laboratory in New Mexico to a 
sanctuary that the Center for Captive Chimpanzee Care will build in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	They are among 111 chimps that the Air Force turned over to the  
Coulston Foundation lab last year over the protests of animal 
rights groups. In September, the Agriculture Department accused the 
Alamogordo, N.M., facility of mistreating its 650 chimpanzees and 
forced it to give up 300 of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know the American public will be thrilled with this  
outcome, as they have shown their concern and support for these 
wonderful chimps who involuntarily served in the Air Force,'' 
Carole Noon, the center's director, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boynton Beach, Fla.-based center, whose board includes  
renowned primatologist Jane Goodall, sued the Air Force after 
unsuccessfully trying to obtain its animals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21 chimps include 6-year-old Lil' Mini, the youngest  
offspring of Mini, the last surviving ``astro-chimp'' from the 
space program's early days who died last year at age 41. 
</P>
<P>
	The 111 chimps are descendants or companions of Ham, the first  
chimpanzee to fly in space, and of Enos, the first chimp to orbit 
the Earth. Some were used in early jet airplane research, including 
the development of ejection seats. In more recent years, more than 
half of the animals have been used in AIDS and hepatitis 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the chimps bound for Florida is infected with AIDS virus  
or hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giving the chimps to Coulston was the easiest and cheapest  
option for the Air Force, as Coulston was already in possession of 
the chimpanzees pursuant to a lease agreement,'' said Robert Symon, 
a lawyer for the Florida center. 
</P>
<P>
	Coulston had operated an Air Force research facility at Holloman  
Air Force Base near Alamogordo since 1993. In addition to giving up 
300 of its chimps, the Coulston lab has also agreed to improve its 
staff and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services  
restricted the lab's handling of animals used in agency-sponsored 
projects.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Extend Rally; Dow Up 140.89 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks extended a rally today, with the Nasdaq  
composite index soaring well into record territory, after Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan suggested that the central bank's 
two interest rate hikes this year seem to be keeping inflation 
under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks raised hopes that the Fed may not see the need for  
repeated additional rate hikes to keep the economy from 
overheating. Interest rates tumbled today on the 
inflation-sensitive government bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	With an hour remaining in trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was up 140.89 at 10,763.42, adding to its 
227.64-point surge on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite  
index was up 97.66 at 2,972.88, well above the record close of 
2,915.95 reached on Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 25.57 at 1,368.00.  
</P>
<P>
	Today's rally on Wall Street came on the 70th anniversary of the  
1929 stock market crash, when the Dow plunged 11.73 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, in a speech at a Florida meeting of business  
executives late Thursday, said a significant upturn in the growth 
of productivity in recent years has boosted the U.S. economy and 
kept inflationary pressures under control. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested that the Fed's two interest rate hikes this summer  
are keeping the economy on a path of noninflationary growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This process of containment may already be significantly  
advanced,'' Greenspan said in citing the impact higher market 
interest rates could be having. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Fed will raise interest rates for the third time this 
year when it meets on Nov. 16. Some traders had worried about 
prospects for more increases down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan didn't say what the Fed will do. He also warned that  
the central bank will be particularly alert in the coming months to 
any signs of slowing productivity --the amount of output per hour of 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Greenspan suggested that he needs to see more  
evidence the economy is slowing in order to keep the central bank 
from raising interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported Thursday that economic activity was  
strong in the third quarter without signs of renewed inflation, 
figures that fueled the market's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the midst of a big rally, and it should carry  
through over several more sessions,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior 
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``But that doesn't mean that 
this is going to last. We still have a bunch of big hurdles ahead 
of us before the Fed's next meeting in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, the buyers are quick on the trigger, but so are the  
sellers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Intel rose 5 9/16 to 77 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market  
after the world's largest maker of computer chips, said production 
of its products this year will not be disrupted by the earthquake 
in Taiwan or the Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin shares tumbled 3 5/8 to 19 5/16 after the defense  
conglomerate slashed its earnings estimate for the year 2000 and 
its president and chief operating officer, Peter B. Teets, 
announced his retirement, blaming himself for the earnings 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Akamai Technologies, a maker of technology used to  
boost the efficiency of the Internet, soared in an initial public 
offering. Akamai was priced at 26 per share, opened at 110, and was 
trading at 147 1/4 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-3 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where 873.88 million shares had changed 
hands by late afternoon, down from extremely heavy volume of 907.69 
million shares Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index was up 6.10 at 428.91.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Halts Two Executions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court known for its impatience with  
death row appeals surprisingly halted two executions this week and 
is on track to issue four significant rulings on capital punishment 
by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	One case asks the justices to ban the electric chair. Two focus  
on a federal law aimed at speeding up executions. The fourth asks 
whether a person can be sentenced to die by a jury admittedly 
confused about a judge's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	The four death-penalty cases represent an unusually high  
percentage of the court's still-growing decision docket, which now 
totals 54. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't expect the court to scale back the states' use of  
capital punishment across the board, but this may be a year when 
important guidelines are offered,'' said Steven Hawkins, executive 
director of the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our hope is the court will conclude that the time has come for  
the electric chair to be eliminated as a means of execution,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the current nine justices is unalterably opposed to  
capital punishment, as were some past justices. 
</P>
<P>
	But an hour before a Virginia death row inmate was to have died  
by lethal injection Thursday night, the justices ordered the 
execution postponed and said they will fully review his case. At 
issue is federal court access for state prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights earlier, they had similarly halted an imminent  
Florida electrocution and agreed to use that death row inmate's 
case to decide whether death in the electric chair amounts to 
unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	Death row inmates in Arizona and Texas failed to win last-minute  
Supreme Court help this week. Those two executions raised the 
year's total to 83, the most since 1954. Across the nation, around 
3,600 convicted killers await execution. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute over continued use of the electric chair may prove  
dramatic in light of recent experiences in Florida, where flames 
shot from one inmate's head, and another bled heavily during his 
execution. But the immediate impact of anything the court decides 
will be limited because only four states -- Florida, Alabama, 
Georgia and Nebraska -- require execution by electrocution. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court were to ban all use of the electric chair, those  
states likely would switch to a more common method such as lethal 
injection. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices are using two Virginia death row cases to clarify  
an expansive 1996 federal law, the Anti-Terrorism and Effective 
Death Penalty Act. The law sharply limited federal court access for 
all defendants convicted in state courts. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue in Terry Williams' case is how much discretion Congress  
wanted federal judges to have in reconsidering state courts' 
findings, particularly over the adequacy of the legal help a 
defendant received. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia death row inmate Michael Williams, who was scheduled to  
die Thursday, is challenging a portion of the 1996 law that bars 
federal judges from conducting hearings if a state prisoner 
``failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in state court 
proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Williams says lower courts wrongly applied that  
provision when denying him a federal court hearing because state 
prosecutors' conduct deprived him of a meaningful hearing in state 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	While both Virginia cases are narrowly focused, the court's  
decision in each could affect hundreds of inmates nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	In another Virginia case, Lonnie Weeks says he was condemned  
after a judge refused to tell jurors they were not required to vote 
for death just because they had made a certain factual finding. The 
jury had told the judge it had not fully understood the sentencing 
instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	If the court's appetite for death penalty disputes is not yet  
satisfied, the justices could agree -- as early as Monday -- to 
tackle a potential whopper. A pair of appeals from Nebraska and 
Florida contend that keeping a convicted killer on death row for a 
long time -- decades after his conviction and sentence -- amounts to 
unconstitutional cruel and unusual punishment.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Gives Penn St. Incentive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- Those parties at Illinois this week were  
felt all the way to Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
	Last weekend's upset over Michigan at Ann Arbor didn't just give  
the Illini their biggest victory in years. It saved Joe Paterno 
from having to give his tired, beaten-up No. 2 Nittany Lions (8-0, 
4-0 Big Ten) that ``there-are-no-easy-games'' spiel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been in two tough, physical and emotional games the  
last two weeks. Now all of a sudden Illinois gets a hot streak,'' 
said Paterno, whose Nittany Lions travel to Illinois (4-3, 1-3) on 
Saturday. ``They're going to be pumped up. It's good for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebacker LaVar Arrington agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``They don't want to be seen as the doormat of the Big Ten, and  
you can see that with how they play,'' he said. ``That's a tough 
team to play, a tough team to beat, when you're playing a team with 
a lot of heart and a lot of pride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches and players go on and on about not overlooking teams,  
how every game is tough, that any team can win, blah, blah, blah. 
But come on. When they're chasing the national championship, 
playing bigger and bigger games, the top teams can't help but look 
at certain games and think, ``Finally. A break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the season usually falls apart. Look at then-No. 1  
Notre Dame's loss to Boston College in 1993. Or Wisconsin's loss to 
Cincinnati earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Or even Penn State's last trip to Illinois as the No. 2 team.  
The Nittany Lions had to rally from 21 points down in 1994 to get 
by the Illini 35-31. They didn't drop in the polls, but they 
couldn't take advantage of No. 1 Nebraska's close victory that 
weekend, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an awful lot of pressure on these kids right now,''  
Paterno said. ``Emotionally as well as the physical part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the Illini seemed the perfect pit stop for the  
Nittany Lions. Illinois was reeling after a home thrashing by 
Minnesota, and the possibility of a winless Big Ten season was 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
	Penn State, meanwhile, would come to Illinois after playing Ohio  
State and Purdue, two of its toughest games of the season, and then 
wrap up its season with Minnesota, Michigan and Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Illinois would have gotten blown out by Michigan, and we  
went out there not ready and they would have done what they are 
capable of doing as they did against Michigan, we could have been 
in trouble,'' Paterno admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't happen. The Illini rallied from a 20-point  
deficit to stun then-No. 9 Michigan 35-29 last week. It was their 
first victory over a ranked team since 1995 and their first over a 
top-10 team since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	It also was Illinois' largest comeback in school history.  
</P>
<P>
	``They beat Michigan at Michigan,'' Penn State guard Eric Cole  
said. ``That's something we haven't done in a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Illini hadn't done it since 1993, either, also the last time  
they beat the Wolverines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody in their right minds believed we were  
going to win,'' quarterback Kurt Kittner said. ``But as long as we 
believed, it didn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, turning around and beating Penn State is a longshot. The  
Illini haven't beaten two ranked teams in a season since 1991. The 
last time they beat ranked opponents in consecutive games was way 
back in 1983, their last Rose Bowl season. 
</P>
<P>
	And Penn State brings a 10-game winning streak, second-longest  
in Division I-A, into the game. The Nittany Lions also are unbeaten 
against Illinois since joining the Big Ten, winning five straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Big deal, Turner said. Penn State's got all the pressure in this  
one. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's late in the season, and they've got a lot at stake,''  
Turner said. ``They cannot afford a letdown.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There won't be one, Arrington promised.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're so close, we can see the end now,'' he said. ``We have  
four tough games left. If we can't get up enough to go out and play 
these games all out, then we never will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And if they still need some inspiration, there's probably a  
post-Michigan party going on somewhere.

<HEADLINE> Doubts for Stewart Crash Inquiry </HEADLINE>

<P>
	ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) -- Investigators sorting through the debris  
of the Learjet crash that killed golfer Payne Stewart and five 
others say small pieces such as cabin seals and valves that 
pressurize the cabin may hold vital clues. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the debris was collected by late Thursday, but it could  
be three or four months before the wreckage is fully analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't identified the important items because of the  
extreme destruction of the aircraft,'' said Bob Benzon, chief 
investigator for the National Transportation Safety Board. ``We're 
looking for small pieces that could be wrapped in the sheet metal 
of the airplane. It's going to take quite a bit of prying and 
cleaning and washing to get what we need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jet crashed into a field near Mina on Monday, four hours  
after leaving Florida bound for Texas. Investigators are trying to 
determine how the plane flew 1,400 miles across the country, 
apparently without someone at the controls. The plane crashed after 
running out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
	One theory is that the jet lost cabin pressure soon after  
takeoff, causing everyone aboard to die or lose consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	A high-level government official, who spoke on the condition of  
anonymity, feared the cause of the crash may never be known because 
the plane and the bodies were so severely damaged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we'll ever be able to tell what happened from  
what we dug out of that hole,'' the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benzon, a veteran investigator who has probed crashes in Hawaii  
and Hong Kong in recent months, compared the investigation to ``a 
giant jigsaw puzzle without the box to look at, or a crossword 
puzzle without clues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Learjet had no flight data recorder. The cockpit voice  
recorder was being examined by NTSB officials in Washington, but 
the device may provide few clues because it has a 30-minute loop 
that usually records over itself. Radio contact with the plane was 
lost hours before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB also is reviewing three Learjet accidents that appear  
similar to Monday's crash. Those planes continued to fly on 
autopilot after their crews blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jackson, Miss., on Thursday, PGA Tour players Andy Bean and  
Bradley Bryant honored Stewart's memory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take away all of Payne's victories, take away all of his money  
and all of his awards and I would be a proud and happy father if my 
sons grew up to be the way Payne Stewart was,'' said Bryant, whose 
sons are 6 and 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The two spoke after completing their rounds at the Southern Farm  
Bureau Classic. A memorial was also held before the Tour 
Championship began in Houston, and another service was scheduled 
for today in Stewart's hometown of Orlando, Fla.

<HEADLINE> Former Twins Owner Memorialized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Calvin Griffith sold the Minnesota Twins 15  
years ago, but baseball was an integral part of his life until the 
day he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of people, including former Twins players, employees,  
family members, friends, community leaders and journalists gathered 
to memorialize Griffith at Westminster Presbyterian Church 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith died Oct. 20 in Melbourne, Fla., at 87 of complications  
from pneumonia, a kidney infection and a high fever. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith angered Washington Senators fans when he moved the team  
to Minnesota after the 1960 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The move also created true happiness for Griffith, his son,  
Clark, said. ``Calvin seemed happier and freer than ever before,'' 
when the 1961 season opened at Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, 
Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis `Cleary, who played for the Senators in 1942 and '43 and  
later worked in various capacities for the Twins for four decades, 
said Griffith almost always seemed to be in a good mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always managed to have fun,'' Cleary, 83, said. ``They  
printed in the Washington Post one time, `How can a team in last 
place always be so happy?' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps Griffith was always so happy because he spent nearly his  
entire adult life involved in baseball, until he sold the Twins in 
1984. At a Metrodome ceremony for the sale to current owner Carl 
Pohlad, Griffith wept. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baseball was Calvin's life,'' Cleary said. ``Every day he was  
involved in baseball in some way or another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In September he was at the Metrodome with his son for a Twins  
game. The two sat in the upper deck stands discussing who to choose 
for the All-Century Team, Clark Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1920s, Griffith was a bat boy and the mascot for  
the Senators, the team for which his uncle and adoptive father, 
Clark, became a Hall of Fame pitcher. Griffith also managed in the 
Senators' minor league system and worked in the front office. He 
took control of the team when his father died in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheelock Whitney, a minority owner of the Minnesota Vikings and  
a Twins board member, said baseball in Griffith's time was simpler 
than today's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith represented ``green grass, black dirt, hot dogs,  
expensive Cokes, white uniforms and those magic nights at Met 
Stadium,'' Whitney said. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith's baseball world began falling apart in the 1970s, when  
free agency began driving up salaries, teams discovered the need to 
advertise and market their product, and the role of corporate 
sponsors in the game increased. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Twins and Griffith refused to change with the times,  
Clark Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was told to manage his public relations,'' Griffith said.  
``Very few of us could have handled the negative press he received. 
He could. I think he liked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he was regularly criticized by the media during the  
last years he owned the Twins, Griffith received credit for the 
Twins' success even after he sold the team to Pohlad, a banker. 
Several players on the 1987 team that won the World Series were 
signed or drafted by Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith will be buried Saturday at Fort Lincoln Cemetery in  
Brentwood, Md.

<HEADLINE> NFL Says No Electronic Earplugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The St. Louis Rams planned to use  
electronic earplugs to drown out crowd noise Sunday at the 
Tennessee Titans' stadium, but the NFL says that violates league 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The Titans notified the NFL after seeing an item on the Internet  
about Rams coach Dick Vermeil's plans for offensive linemen to wear 
the earplugs that can be set to drown out all noise except the 
voice of quarterback Kurt Warner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know there was a rule against it,'' Vermeil said  
Thursday. ``I thought innovation was a part of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL bars use of any electronic device on the field, with the  
exception of a coach-to-quarterback communication system. 
</P>
<P>
	The sold-out stadium, which seats 67,000, will be the largest  
crowd the Rams have played in front of on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Word's getting around that Adelphia Coliseum is a tough place  
to play and we have to continue to build that home-field advantage, 
make it the toughest to play in the NFL,'' Titans coach Jeff Fisher 
said.

<HEADLINE> Corporate Charity Disclosure Mulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers are considering whether corporations  
should have to disclose information about the charitable 
contributions they make. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because those gifts are donated from shareholder earnings, a  
reasonable disclosure is therefore a matter of accountability,'' 
said Rep. Paul Gillmor, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Commerce 
subcommittee on finance, which held a hearing on the subject 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The subcommittee also discussed whether investment firms should  
be required to disclose, on investors' account statements, to what 
extent taxes may eat into mutual fund earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillmor has introduced legislation that would require publicly  
traded companies to include disclosure of charitable gifts, 
including the amount and recipient, in financial statements filed 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission before their annual 
shareholders meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also require companies to reveal whether any  
executive, board member or their spouse was a director or trustee 
of a charity that received a gift. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillmor said he is pushing House leaders to put the measure,  
along with the mutual fund proposal, to a vote this fall or next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, U.S. companies -- which donate more than $8.5 billion  
annually -- are under no obligation to disclose their charitable 
giving. Many do so anyway, even featuring it in advertising, 
because of the public good will it can generate. 
</P>
<P>
	Such voluntary disclosure may be selective, however, said Robert  
B. Thompson, a professor of corporate law at Washington University 
in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where there is resistance is where there's a specific  
conflict, where there's the potential of embarrassment,'' Thompson 
told lawmakers. ``Today's corporate philanthropy sometimes 
functions to promote and aggrandize corporate managers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of controversial corporate philanthropy, Thompson  
cited a company that spent $100 million to build a museum to house 
its CEO's art collection. 
</P>
<P>
	Requiring disclosure of relationships between company managers  
and charities could, however, discourage some giving, argued James 
Mason, director of community affairs for the Eaton Corp., a 
Cleveland-based manufacturer of industrial products. 
</P>
<P>
	Mason said that much of the $5 million in charitable gifts Eaton  
distributed last year was to organizations its employees are 
involved with. 
</P>
<P>
	``We like to encourage the men and women who are employed with  
us to step up to that,'' said Mason. ``I guess I'm a little 
concerned that the implication drawn in the legislation ... is that 
there would be something sinister in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The idea of greater disclosure by mutual fund managers of  
investors' tax liabilities, meanwhile, has broad industry support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Taxes are the largest cost of mutual fund investment for most  
investors,'' said Joel Dickson, senior investment analyst for the 
Vanguard Group. 
</P>
<P>
	When most mutual funds report investors earnings, however, they  
do not disclose how much individuals may have to pay in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Having a general idea of that -- although actual tax bills vary  
depending on a person's total income and other factors -- can be 
valuable as people try to decide where to invest.

<HEADLINE> Skate America: Yagudin Edges Weiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Two-time world champion Alexei  
Yagudin, benefiting from generous judging after a sloppy routine, 
won the short program in Skate America on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, who is using the season's first major international  
competition as a tune-up -- he will get no points here in the Grand 
Prix series because he will compete in two other events -- landed a 
sharp quadruple toe loop. But his shaky triple axel-double toe was 
unimpressive and his spins were slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he edged American champion Michael Weiss, who stepped out  
of his quad, but had a strong triple axel-triple toe combination. 
Weiss, who will get points in this competition, edged countryman 
Timothy Goebel. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagudin, who swept the nine-judge panel, claimed he didn't know  
this was an exhibition event for him, and that it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know which of the competitions I get points. Is this  
one?'' he said, drawing laughs. ``I don't think about points. 
People expect me to skate well all the time. I try to make the 
people happy to see me skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, who became a father for the second time last week and has  
been fighting a sore ankle and a sinus infection, was pleased with 
his opening performance of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an interesting couple of weeks for me,'' he said.  
``It's a big step to know with things not going smoothly, I can put 
out a short program that was solid. It's a big help for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time world champion Elvis Stojko of Canada was just behind  
Goebel, mainly because Goebel hit his quad salchow and Stojko 
didn't attempt a quad. Stojko also put his hand down on a triple 
axel in combination. 
</P>
<P>
	Goebel was more impressed that he had strong artistic marks,  
previously a weak area. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time ever, my artistic marks substantially  
improved in some cases. It was definitely a change I needed,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later Friday night, Michelle Kwan began her competitive season  
against a mediocre field in the women's short program. 
</P>
<P>
	The day's biggest surprise came in pairs, with two-time world  
champions Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze fourth in the 
short program. She fell on side-by-side triple toe loops, and then 
went down again on a throw triple loop. 
</P>
<P>
	That left plenty of room for Canadians Jamie Sale and David  
Pelletier to win the short. Even though they form the No. 2 couple 
in Canada, Sale and Pelletier easily outdistanced more established 
pairs from Germany and France. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very strong competition,'' Pelletier said. ``Eight  
teams are here and six were in the top 10 at worlds. We are very 
surprised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not at all surprising -- as if there ever are any stunners in ice  
dancing -- the leaders after the compulsories and original dance 
were favorites Irina Lobacheva and Ilia Averbukh of Russia.

<HEADLINE> Canucks Acquire Schwab From Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Vancouver Canucks  
acquired Corey Schwab from the expansion Atlanta Thrashers to 
bolster their injury-depleted goalie ranks Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks gave up a conditional pick in the 2000 draft for  
Schwab, who has played five games, posting a 3-1-1 record and 2.25 
goals-against average this season with the Orlando Solar Bears of 
the International Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
	Acquired by the Thrashers in last summer's expansion draft,  
Schwab has four years of NHL experience, the last three with the 
Tampa Bay Lightning, where he was 21-46-5. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came after Canucks goalie Kevin Weekes injured his  
right knee in Thursday's 4-1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekes was the second goalie lost by the Canucks this month. No.  
1 goalie Garth Snow fractured a finger and is expected to miss at 
least another two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks have no other experienced goalie in their system,  
and were forced to use Alfie Michaud, who made his NHL debut 
filling in for Weekes against the Coyotes.

<HEADLINE> Canucks Obtain Goalie Corey Schwab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- With Kevin Weekes doubtful  
for Saturday night's game because of a knee injury, the Vancouver 
Canucks obtained goaltender Corey Schwab from the Atlanta Thrashers 
in a trade on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekes, starting in place of Garth Snow, who has been sidelined  
since Oct. 13 with a broken finger, left Thursday's 4-1 loss to 
Phoenix early in the first period with a ``twinge'' in his right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors examined the knee Friday, but it's unlikely he'll be in  
goal when the Canucks play the Nashville Predators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a pretty sure bet Schwab will start,'' said general  
manager Brian Burke. ``We've been in the hunt for a goaltender to 
come in and fill a sport for some time now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Schwab in transit from Orlando, where he's been playing in  
the International Hockey League, and Weekes in sick bay, the 
Canucks were forced to use dressing room attendant Tim Gross in net 
during practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canucks have been trying to make a deal ever since they  
learned Snow would be lost for up to six weeks. In Schwab, 28, they 
get a goalie who has spent most of his career in the minors but 
managed a 21-46-5 record and 3.25 goals-against average in 87 games 
over a three-year span with the Tampa Bay Lightning. 
</P>
<P>
	To get Schwab, the Canucks gave up a conditional pick in the  
2000 draft. He came highly recommended by Vancouver goaltending 
consultant Andy Moog, who worked with the expansion Thrashers last 
year 
</P>
<P>
	``He rated Corey Schwab in the top two or three goaltenders  
available for the expansion draft,'' Burke said. ``He feels very 
strongly about his ability. He's a very competitive kid. His style 
is sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alfie Michaud, 22, who had played just three games as a pro in  
the American Hockey League, was pressed into service against the 
Coyotes. He gave up all four goals but made 20 saves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll just try and learn from this,'' said Michaud, a free  
agent this year after leading Maine to the NCAA championship. 
``It's not a good feeling losing. You've got to be ready when you 
get a chance to go in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke thinks Michaud has a future, but isn't ready for the NHL  
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pleased with Alfie,'' he said. ``That's about as  
difficult a position as a goaltender can be thrust into as a 
youngster. We did not play well in front of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burke wouldn't speculate what Vancouver will do with Schwab, who  
comes with a one-way, $525,000 contract, once Snow and Weekes are 
both healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> School Security Handbook Available </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new government handbook allows  
administrators and law enforcement officials to analyze a school's 
vulnerability to violence and suggests technologies to deter 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide, developed at the Energy Department's nuclear weapons  
laboratory in Sandia, N.M., will be available on the Internet 
beginning Monday. It provides practical tips on protecting 
buildings and grounds and gives advice on purchase of equipment for 
video surveillance, weapons detection, entry control and duress 
alarms. 
</P>
<P>
	The handbook says it is ``imperative'' that security personnel  
be involved in designing any new school. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful attention should be paid to seemingly minor issues such  
as broken windows or litter because they can leave the impression 
of a problem school, the handbook says. 
</P>
<P>
	And simple maintenance can be the most important security task.  
``Unfortunately, the most ignored maintenance task in most school 
security departments is the regular servicing and cleaning of 
VCRs'' the handbook advises. 
</P>
<P>
	A paramount concern should be controlling the access of  
students, parents, employees and visitors. The guide suggests that 
``to best control a school building,'' the number of entrances 
``must be severely limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And every school ``needs a well-thought-out annually updated  
crisis plan, with regular training for all those who might be 
involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report strongly urges the use of video cameras and closed  
circuit television systems to enhance peace of mind, deter 
potential problems and keep outsiders away. In addition to cameras 
designed to be visible, ``a whole new industry has arisen ... that 
specializes in ... tiny, easily hidden cameras,'' the handbook 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Cautioning that school officials should consult an attorney  
first, the report notes that ``an amazing array of disguised 
cameras'' can be installed within smoke detectors, clocks, 
speakers, light switches, junction boxes, neckties and caps. 
</P>
<P>
	The guide is entitled ``The Appropriate and Effective Use of  
Security Technologies in U.S. Schools.'' It will be available 
beginning Monday on the Department of Energy's Web site: 
http://www.doe.gov/schoolsecurity/pdf.htm.

</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With George Steinbrenner waving a broom from a  
float, the New York Yankees were honored with a flood of fans for 
what's become an annual autumn rite: a ticker-tape parade for the 
pinstriped champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called in sick to be here,'' said Anthony Hernandez, 42, who  
sported the No. 26 jersey of his namesake, Orlando ``El Duque'' 
Hernandez. ``My boss is a Mets fan, and he wouldn't understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities were the third in the last four years for the  
Yankees, who assured their place as the team of the '90s and the 
team of the century by sweeping the Atlanta Braves in the World 
Series on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two Yankees' parades, following their titles in 1996  
and 1998, each drew crowds of 3.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade, with the players riding a half-dozen floats, stepped  
off shortly after noon amid a blizzard of paper and weather more in 
keeping with spring. 
</P>

wild crowd. Chili Davis smoked a victory cigar. World Series MVP 
Mariano Rivera, the Yankees' unhittable reliever, rode alone on his

</P>
<P>
	The parade, with the Yankee players riding a half-dozen floats,  
began shortly after noon amid a blizzard of paper.

<P>
	The crowd in lower Manhattan was so thick that many revelers  
couldn't even see the parade.

<P>
	Following the ticker-tape trip through the Canyon of Heroes --

<P>
	The parade route along the financial district's narrow streets,  
from the Battery to City Hall, is less than a mile long.

Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said their invitations were rescinded to 
send a message: Don't vote against the city's interests.

<P>
	Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a Yankees fan from upstate, said he took  
away this message: ``He puts the rude in Rudy.''

<HEADLINE> Slain Businessmen Said Informers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLTS NECK, N.J. (AP) -- Two Internet stock promoters found shot  
to death in a New Jersey mansion had served as government 
informants, providing information on securities fraud cases, 
according to published reports today. 
</P>
<P>
	Alain Chalem and Maier Lehmann were crippled by gunfire and then  
shot point-blank in their heads, investigators said. Their bodies 
were found early Tuesday in the opulent estate Chalem shared with 
his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	Regulatory and law enforcement sources said they were uncertain  
whether the information the men provided in the securities 
investigations was damaging enough to provoke the shootings, The 
New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Lehmann had cooperated with authorities following a plea  
agreement stemming from a 1992 insurance fraud case, The 
Star-Ledger of Newark reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to mail fraud in the case, which eventually  
netted more than 100 defendants, including insurance company 
officials. In exchange for helping federal prosecutors, Lehmann was 
sentenced to house arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye has said earlier that the  
men had ties to ``shady'' business dealings and the attack was 
possibly linked to their penny stock Web operation, 
www.stockinvestor.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Chalem, 41, and Lehmann, 37, were not registered brokers. They  
promoted certain stocks on their Web site, which is registered in 
Panama and operated by an administrator in Hungary, regulators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives from the prosecutor's office, as well as FBI agents  
and SEC investigators, are trying to unravel the complex web of 
stock deals the two were involved in, said prosecutor Robert 
Honecker. 
</P>
<P>
	One theory they are checking is that the men were killed by  
``somebody who did not like the fact that they may have lost 
money'' doing business with them, Honecker said. 
</P>
<P>
	County authorities also said they are investigating possible  
organized-crime links to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Securities and Exchange Commission last year charged Lehmann  
and other defendants with distributing false information about 
companies after Electro Optical System Corp. stock rose from 50 
cents to more than $5 per share in one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors eventually lost at least $10 million in that scheme,  
authorities have said. Lehmann agreed in January to pay $630,000 in 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1994 and 1996, Chalem worked at the brokerage A.S.  
Goldmen and Co., which was indicted in July in New York on charges 
connected with stock manipulation, forgery and illegal trading. The 
firm has denied the accusations, and Chalem was not named in those 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	People involved in the continuing investigation of Goldmen said  
Chalem had provided information in the case, the Times reported.

<HEADLINE> Mariah Carey Bolts From CBS Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than a week before its premiere, CBS's  
``The Early Show'' was delivered a big-time snub by Mariah Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	The pop diva backed out of a concert scheduled to give a flashy  
launch to the morning show next Monday and, to make matters worse, 
decided to sing instead for CBS's rival, the top-rated ``Today'' 
show on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The diva's dance between the two shows suggests just how nasty  
competition for big-name guests is likely to get in television's 
morning news wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey, who agreed to the concert to promote a new album due out  
Tuesday, pulled out of ``The Early Show'' late Wednesday because 
she was nervous about CBS's ability to get a city permit for the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Friedman, senior executive producer for ``The Early  
Show,'' brushed off the switch with a dig at his NBC rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We not only have to book our own show, but we have to help the  
others come up with their ideas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had grand plans to shut down a portion of Manhattan's Fifth  
Avenue for the concert, but the plans kept getting scaled back, 
said Larry Jenkins, spokesman for Columbia Records. The event 
couldn't be publicized until the permit was secured, so an 
ultimatum was issued: no permit by the end of the day Wednesday, no 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5:45 p.m., Carey bolted. Within an hour, she was booked on  
``Today.'' A permit was issued shortly thereafter, but it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing we have done either maliciously or  
intentionally,'' Jenkins said. ``But we have an artist with an 
album coming out next week and it is our responsibility to find the 
best situation for her. We agonized over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' was only too happy to accommodate Carey, even though  
executive producer Jeff Zucker had publicly vowed not to book 
guests aligned with Pat Kingsley, a partner in Carey's public 
relations firm, after Kingsley client Calista Flockhart backed out 
of a summer appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Show spokeswoman Allison Gollust said the ban applied only to  
Kingsley's personal clients, not to all people represented by her 
firm, PMK. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a chance to stick it to `The Early Show,'''  
Gollust said Thursday. ``There's no question a Mariah Carey concert 
would be a lot of fun, not only for guests of our show but our 
viewers. We would be silly to pass it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, meanwhile, is left with a concert permit, but no artist.  
Friedman wouldn't say what ``The Early Show'' would do for a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life goes on,'' he said. ``This is not some major thing that's  
going to change the face of Monday morning. It's our premiere, 
people will watch us to see what we're doing. If we're good, fine. 
If we're not, Mariah Carey couldn't have saved us.''

	NEW YORK (AP) -- With George Steinbrenner waving a broom from a  
float, the New York Yankees were honored with a flood of fans for 
what's become an annual autumn rite: a ticker-tape parade for the 
pinstriped champions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called in sick to be here,'' said Anthony Hernandez, 42, who  
sported the No. 26 jersey of his namesake, Orlando ``El Duque'' 
Hernandez. ``My boss is a Mets fan, and he wouldn't understand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The festivities were the third in the last four years for the  
Yankees, who assured their place as the team of the '90s and the 
team of the century by sweeping the Atlanta Braves in the World 
Series on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The last two Yankees' parades, following their titles in 1996  
and 1998, each drew crowds of 3.5 million people. 
</P>
<P>
	The parade, with the players riding a half-dozen floats, stepped  
off shortly after noon amid a blizzard of paper and weather more in 
keeping with spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, rode in the top of a  
double-decker bus, waving a broom -- the symbol of his team's sweep.

<HEADLINE> Sunday Inspires Halloween Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With Halloween falling on a Sunday this year, many communities  
are holding trick-or-treating on Saturday night instead, in some 
cases because they don't want youngsters dressing up as demons on 
the Lord's day. 
</P>
<P>
	Some communities cite the conflict with the Sabbath. Others note  
that Sunday is a school night or that daylight-saving time ends at 
2 a.m. Sunday, meaning darkness will fall an hour earlier than on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We already have Sunday observed for someone,'' said Kenny  
Clemons, mayor of Gardendale, Ala., who is urging residents to mark 
the holiday Saturday. ``That's the Lord's day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Salt Lake City, celebrations haven't been officially banned  
on Sunday, though the Mormon Church is asking people to pick 
another day. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city where more than 70 percent of the population is  
Mormon, that doesn't leave much choice, according to Stephanie 
Homaechevarria. When she tried to take her children 
trick-or-treating in 1993, the last time Halloween fell on Sunday, 
she and her 3-year-old were snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of 10 houses, only one would open their door to us,'' Ms.  
Homaechevarria said. 
</P>
<P>
	Confusion reigns in Arizona, where officials in Mesa,  
Scottsdale, Gilbert and Fountain Hills have gotten calls seeking 
guidance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess there's a lot of conflict because of people's  
religious holidays,'' said Amy Silverman, Fountain Hills youth and 
teen services coordinator. ``Or people like to go to church on 
Sunday and they don't like to go trick or treating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago suburb of Harvey moved trick-or-treating to  
Saturday, as did the Missouri towns of Fayette and Boonville, and 
Noblesville, Ind., near Indianapolis. Birmingham and Huntsville, 
Ala., also prefer Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other cities are deciding not to even get involved. Vestavia  
Hills, Ala., Mayor Pat Reynolds learned his lesson when he moved 
the holiday to Saturday six years ago. ``It was utter chaos,'' he 
said. ``I got chewed up one side and down the other. This time, I'm 
staying out of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The confusion is fine with some trick-or-treaters.  
</P>
<P>
	Nine-year-old Michael Nichols of Marietta, Ga., figures he will  
get extra use from his Star Wars costume. On Saturday, he will hit 
a church event. Then, he said, ``I'll go around the neighborhood 
Sunday.''

<HEADLINE> Suspects Arrested in Jewel Heists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Four people suspected of stealing $100 million  
in jewelry in a nationwide string of smash-and-grab robberies have 
been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges are expected to be filed next week against Clinton  
Randolph, 34, Anthony Billberry, 36, Jabbey Lawson, 32, and LaDonna 
Livingston, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	They were arrested Thursday on fugitive warrants involving  
several crimes, including burglary, theft and attempted murder, 
Spinosa said. Their hometowns were not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe others are involved, but the four arrested are  
believed to the core of the crime ring, Police Lt. Larry Spinosa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They targeted the finest jewelry stores, knew exactly what  
items they were looking for, broke the display cases with hammers 
and took the jewelry,'' Spinosa said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he said, the group may have been responsible for as many  
as 80 jewelry store burglaries in the past 15 years in states 
including Arizona, California, Illinois, Missouri, Michigan, South 
Carolina, Texas and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Its members are suspected in at least three Las Vegas burglaries  
earlier this year, Spinosa said. They were arrested on a tip that 
they recently had returned to the Las Vegas area, Spinosa said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Goes To Court Over Turtles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission said Friday it  
was taking Greece to court for failing to protect a rare 
Mediterranean sea turtle that has turned into a major tourist 
attraction on an Ionian island. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Commission is dissatisfied with the safeguards applied on  
the Greek island of Zakynthos, where important nesting beaches ... 
are not being sufficiently protected,'' it said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Caretta Caretta turtle nests on one the most popular beaches  
of the island in the Laganas bay and the Commission said it was 
forced to take Greece to court because of its ``dissatisfaction'' 
with the environmental protection on the island, some 200 miles 
west of Athens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission said the Greek authorities claimed they intended  
to open a marine park but needed to complete further legal 
procedures.

<HEADLINE> NHL Hurricanes Open New Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- William Moss and his two buddies found  
their seats quickly Friday night after the doors to the Raleigh 
Entertainment and Sports Arena opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is 100 times better than Greensboro,'' said Moss, 14, who  
was sitting up against the glass behind the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, fans who wanted to attend a Carolina  
Hurricanes home game had to drive to Greensboro, 80 miles from 
team's official home city. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, Carolina has a permanent home -- a $154 million,  
18,500-seat arena across from North Carolina State's Carter-Finley 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The tan concrete oval with aqua-colored glass windows dominates  
the local landscape. Inside, red and black is the main color 
scheme. Above center ice, decorated with Carolina's hurricane logo, 
is an eight-sided scoreboard with video screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad the 'Canes are here,'' said Charlotte Mayo, who  
cheered on the Hurricanes on Friday night with a sign that said, 
``Welcome Home Y'all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina lost the home-opener 4-2 to New Jersey, but the  
Hurricanes enjoyed being in their new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was phenomenal. We came out and played a sound  
game,'' rookie defenseman David Tanabe said. ``I enjoyed being on 
the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Carolina faced off with the Devils, fans were treated to  
a video montage of Hurricanes' highlights to the music of ``Top 
Gun.'' Swing band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy played a few tunes while 
dancers performed on rugs laid on top of the face-off circles. 
</P>
<P>
	Another video showed Carolina's hog mascot, Stormy, running  
through the state to find his way to Raleigh. The trip did not 
include Greensboro, which ranked last in NHL attendance last year. 
Stormy finally got on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in Durham to 
arrive at the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Hurricanes' lineup was announced, a red Southeast  
Division championship banner was unveiled to a standing ovation. 
The crowd then grew quiet for several seconds in memory of 
Hurricanes defenseman Steve Chiasson, who died in a wreck while 
driving drunk last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman gave the arena two thumbs up.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Hurricanes have a terrific home,'' he said before the  
game. ``This is making a new beginning that I think will do nothing 
but bring success to the Triangle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat and Charles Combs drove an hour from Goldsboro and arrived  
at 3:30 p.m. to watch the pre-game festivities outside the arena. A 
rock band, clowns and a man on stilts entertained fans waiting for 
the doors to open. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Hurricanes bent red, black and white balloons  
into hockey sticks and hats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're our favorite team,'' Pat Combs said. ``I didn't like  
hockey, then they got me hooked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials originally hoped to open the facility in time for the  
Special Olympics in late June; then deadlines of Sept. 1 and Sept. 
15 were set. Carolina played the first nine games this season on 
the road to allow more time to finish construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for the team to finally have a home,'' said Mark  
Baumann, who drove from New Jersey with his 10-year-old son to 
cheer on the Devils. ``You just hope they get enough fan support so 
they can stay here.''

<HEADLINE> Gophers Know Damage Brees Can Do </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Big Ten's best defense gets its biggest  
test Saturday in Purdue quarterback Drew Brees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing, having watched him last year. I didn't know he  
could do all that,'' Minnesota safety Delvin Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Brees passed for 522 yards and six touchdowns in a  
56-21 victory over the Golden Gophers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers have lost by a field goal to national powers  
Wisconsin and Ohio State at home in the last three weeks. But they 
know they're going to have to play Purdue much better than they did 
last year if they want to stay close to the 18th-ranked 
Boilermakers at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year? I think we can learn from it,'' Gophers defensive  
back Jack Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't just the humbled defenders who learned their lesson,  
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year was the worst game we've played since coach (Glen)  
Mason has been here,'' Minnesota running back Thomas Hamner said. 
``We've moved on and we've learned from it. We have to come out and 
set the tempo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers (5-2, 2-2 Big Ten) would be tied with Penn State  
atop the Big Ten with an inside shot at the Rose Bowl if not for 
their 20-17 overtime loss to Wisconsin on Oct. 9 and their 20-17 
defeat against Ohio State last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, Minnesota squandered late leads and failed in the  
fourth quarter to put away a ranked opponent at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Without Michigan or Michigan State on their schedule this  
season, the Gophers had high hopes of not only posting their first 
winning season since 1990 and earning their first bowl bid since 
1986 but also of finishing in the Big Ten's upper echelon. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they've got difficult games against Purdue (5-3, 2-3) and  
Penn State before closing out the season with Indiana and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if they do get a winning season and a bowl bid, they'll  
lament these lost chances. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose close games like that, it's usually what you do  
to yourself that's the difference,'' said Gophers quarterback Billy 
Cockerham, who threw an interception that was returned for a 
touchdown by the Buckeyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the Gophers face a team that nearly beat Penn State last  
week when Brees came within 12 yards of ending the Nittany Lions' 
undefeated season and maybe their national title hopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees threw for 379 yards and two touchdowns. Three completions  
in the final minute brought the 18th-ranked Boilermakers from their 
30 to the Lions' 12. Out of timeouts, Brees attempted four passes, 
and each fell incomplete, giving No. 2 Penn State a 31-25 triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Brees became the third quarterback in Purdue history with 600  
completions, passing Jim Everett and ending the game only seven 
short of second-place Scott Campbell's 609. Mark Herrmann holds the 
record of 772. 
</P>
<P>
	In 21 starts, Brees has thrown for 57 touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
	The Gophers don't need any reminders of how good Brees is,  
however. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brees is a great passer,'' Brewer said. ``He's the best in the  
Big Ten and one of the best in the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If not the best.  
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I haven't seen all of the quarterbacks,'' Mason said,  
``but I don't think there is a better quarterback in the country 
than Drew Brees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive end Karon Riley, the Big Ten's leading pass-rusher,  
knows what the Gophers are in for, even if they play well against 
Brees. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to make big plays,'' Riley said. ``He didn't get to  
the level he's at by shying away from pressure. Hopefully, we can 
disrupt his rhythm.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton, plunging back into Middle East  
peacemaking, says Israel and its Arab neighbors have a chance for a 
permanent settlement of their decades-long conflict ``within the 
reasonable near future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton said the opportunity won't last long and could  
easily be lost. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the moment that we must seize,'' he said Friday night  
in Atlanta at a convention of the Anti-Defamation League, the 
Jewish group that has been a leader in the battle against bigotry 
and racism. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Clinton will travel to Norway to meet with Israeli  
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at a 
tribute to slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated 
four years ago by an Israeli opponent of the peace process. The 
president has described the talks in Oslo as another step in the 
march toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``We actually have a chance within the reasonable near future  
for peace for Israel and its neighbors,'' Clinton said. ``But like 
all chances in life, it is fleeting. It will require hard choices 
and hard work within a short time frame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat and Barak have set a deadline of next February to reach a  
broad outline for solving many of the toughest disputes in the 
Middle East and to come to a final agreement by September 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe that we're either going to go forward or drift  
backward,'' Clinton said. ``We can't just freeze this moment. The 
region still could reverse course. There are still plenty of 
extremists and terrorists out there. ... Make no mistake about it, 
our problems with the enemies of peace, the terrorists are far from 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also used the ADL speech to renew his campaign for  
Congress to pass a new hate-crime law to combat violence prompted 
by a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hate crimes victimize not only the victim, but they victimize  
society as a whole in a special way,'' the president said, 
``because they contradict the very idea of America we are trying to 
build.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that if he could give America just one gift, it  
would be ``the ability to be one America, to bridge all divides. 
... We still can't form a society where no one hates anybody else 
because they're different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate, by unanimous vote, has approved a hate-crimes  
prevention bill. But House Republican leaders contend such 
legislation is repetitive and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure Clinton is pushing would add crimes motivated by  
sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list of hate 
crimes already covered by federal law -- those motivated by race, 
religion, color or national origin. Inclusion in the law means 
harsher penalties for violators and gives federal prosecutors the 
option of stepping in if local authorities decline to press 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
	On another front, Clinton criticized Republicans for denying  
money for Middle East peacemaking, to pay the U.S. debt to the 
United Nations, to destroy Russian nuclear warheads and for other 
foreign policy initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them really think that the only thing we've got to do  
is build a bigger bomb and a bigger wall and we'll be fine because 
the Cold War is over,'' Clinton said. ``I think that is nuts.''

<HEADLINE> Shepard Beating Described in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- Prosecutors rested their case against Aaron  
McKinney today after presenting jurors his jailhouse confession and 
a timeline of the night Matthew Shepard was beaten. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense was expected to begin its case in the afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Over four days, prosecutors called investigators, McKinney's  
then-girlfriend and another friend, but they didn't call his 
alleged accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
	In an hour-long jailhouse recording played for jurors on  
Thursday, McKinney described how he and a friend didn't intend to 
hurt Shepard but rob him. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the three were riding in a pickup truck, Shepard ``starts  
grabbing my leg and my genitals,'' McKinney told police. ``I don't 
do that stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hit him ... and he kept throwing himself all over me,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney said he delivered all the blows that may have been the  
last thing Shepard ever felt. He said the friend, Russell 
Henderson, stood by and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had really no intention of hurting this guy,'' he said.  
``It was to take him out and scare him and take his wallet and 
leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob DeBree, the lead police investigator, said McKinney claimed  
he was told by Shepard ``he could turn us on to cocaine or 
methamphetamine in exchange for sex.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no evidence Shepard had access to methamphetamine, but  
``we were advised Matt had dabbled in some drug (cocaine) activity 
prior to that,'' DeBree said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shepard, a 21-year-old University of Wyoming student, was left  
for 18 hours on the freezing prairie, and died on Oct. 7, 1998. His 
death galvanized those seeking to expand the nation's hate-crime 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney, 22, is charged with robbery, kidnapping and murder,  
and could be sentenced to death if convicted. Henderson, also 22, 
is serving two life sentences for murder and kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney said Shepard approached him and Henderson in a Laramie  
bar. Shepard didn't make a pass at the two, he said: ``All he 
really did is ask for a ride home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about his attitude toward gays, McKinney said, ``I  
really don't hate them but I don't like them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in the truck, McKinney said, Shepard made an aggressive  
sexual advance and the beating began. He continued the assault at a 
ranch a mile from Laramie, and let Henderson tie Shepard to a 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
	When the two asked Shepard if he had seen the license plate of  
their truck, McKinney said, Shepard read the plate numbers back. 
McKinney said he struck him three final times. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he thought Shepard would die there, McKinney didn't call  
an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	While the tape was played, the jury read along with transcripts.  
Shepard's mother, Judy, stared or gazed down. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys are trying to convince the jury McKinney is  
guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. They have argued that he 
snapped during a drunken, drug-induced rage after a sexual advance 
by Shepard triggered memories of a childhood homosexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, McKinney's former girlfriend testified that the two  
plotted to pose as homosexuals and rob Shepard, and that McKinney 
later acknowledged they had killed someone. 
</P>
<P>
	McKinney claimed ``a gay guy had been hitting on him (in the  
bar),'' Kristen Price, 19, told jurors. ``They decided in the 
bathroom to pretend they were gay, get him in the truck and rob 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, McKinney, covered in blood, returned to their  
home and told her ``he had killed someone,'' she said. He went to a 
sink to wash off a wallet, two driver's licenses and a voter 
registration card. 
</P>
<P>
	She also testified that she didn't see any sign that McKinney  
had been using drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Her testimony was intended to counter defense contentions that  
the robbery wasn't planned and was related to drugs.

	LARAMIE, Wyo. (AP) -- One of two men accused of killing gay  
college student Matthew Shepard told police he repeatedly beat the 
victim after an unwelcome sexual advance on a night that began when 
Shepard asked for a ride home.

<HEADLINE> Forty One Carats Wins Handicap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Forty One Carats held off a late  
stretch run by Unbridled Jet and captured the $400,000 Pegasus 
Handicap on Friday night by a nose, setting a Meadowlands Racetrack 
record for 1 1/8-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory completed a sweep of the major races at the  
Meadowlands this meet for jockey Jorge Chavez. He guided Pleasant 
Breeze to the winner's circle in the $500,000 Meadowlands Cup two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty One Carats was timed in 1:45 2-5 in breaking the record of  
1:46 set by K.J.'s Appeal in the Meadowlands Cup last year. The 
victory was the third straight and the fifth in six starts for the 
David Fawkes-trained son of Tactical Advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty One Carats paid $6.40, $3 and $2.40. Unbridled Jet paid $3  
and $2.20, while Talk's Cheap finished third in the field of six 
3-year-olds and was worth $2.60 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty One Carats, who carried co-highweight of 120 pounds, broke  
from the No. 3 post and quickly went to the lead and stayed in 
front by a couple of lengths until the middle of the stretch when 
Jerry Bailey and favored Unbridled Jet got in gear. 
</P>
<P>
	The two colts ran almost a tandem for the final 100 yards with  
each bob of the head seemingly giving the other the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``He ran well. He just didn't get the photo,'' Bailey said. ``I  
didn't want to lose as much ground as I did but I had to start 
running sometime because horses were stacking up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty One Carats got the last bob and finished a nose in front,  
making Unbridled Jet the sixth straight favorite to lose this race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him coming and I thought I was going to get beat,''  
Chavez said. ``I knew I was going too fast. No horse can run that 
fast and finish. I was trying to keep his head up so he could see 
the other horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zanetti, the other co-highweight, finished fourth followed by  
Fact Not Fiction and Badger Gold. Dancin Rahy was a late scratch.

<HEADLINE> Pistons Waive Pooh Richardson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Detroit Pistons on Friday waived  
veteran guard Pooh Richardson about a month after signing him to a 
one-year deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33-year-old Richardson had spent the past five seasons with  
the Los Angeles Clippers, who bought out the remainder of his 
contract in September. 
</P>
<P>
	In six exhibitions games with the Pistons, Richardson averaged  
2.5 points in 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson entered the NBA in 1989 as the first-round draft pick  
of the Minnesota Timberwolves. After a three-year stint in 
Minnesota, Richardson played for the Indiana Pacers for two 
seasons. He was acquired by the Clippers in a 1994 trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10-year NBA veteran has a career average of 11.1 points and  
6.5 assists in 639 games. He was hampered by an ankle injury last 
season and expressed frustration playing for the woeful Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson played at UCLA.

<HEADLINE> Latex Glove Maker Said Funded Koop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop received  
money from a leading manufacturer of latex gloves, a relationship 
he did not reveal as he insisted to Congress and others that the 
gloves did not present a health risk, The New York Times reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Beth Zupa, a spokeswoman for Koop, acknowledged he was paid  
under a four-year, $1 million contract signed in 1994 with WRP 
Corp., the glove manufacturer. She said the contract didn't last 
the full four years and that it had nothing to do with WRP's latex 
division. Koop denied to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the nation's most recognizable health experts, Koop  
dismissed warnings from scientists that powdered latex gloves could 
cause serious and even life-threatening allergic reactions. 
</P>
<P>
	He reportedly telephoned Dr. Linda Rosenstock, the director of  
the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, in 1997 
to say a warning against the gloves could cause health workers to 
abandon gloves that could protect them against infection. 
</P>
<P>
	NIOSH studies show that 10 percent of such workers regularly  
exposed to the gloves developed allergies. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Koop testified before a subcommittee of the U.S. House  
Committee on Education and the Work Force, telling the panel that 
the hazards being linked to the gloves were exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanford Lewis, a lawyer for Healthcare Without Harm, said Koop's  
influence on public policy could have been lessened had the WRP 
contract been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Would even Dr. Koop have sounded so convincing if he had  
disclosed his financial deal with the glove company?'' Lewis asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission  
showed that WRP paid a ``spokesman'' $656,250 in consulting fees 
through February 1997. A WRP representative told the Times Koop was 
that individual. 
</P>
<P>
	Koop was criticized earlier this year over his partial ownership  
of the Web site drkoop.com, designed to present objective health 
information. For a time, he was entitled to a commission on 
products sold through the site.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Flock to Orlando for Payne Crashed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *By DOUG FERGUSON 	
</P>
<P>
                           *AP Golf Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Payne Stewart was remembered today as a  
tough competitor who loved life and had a passion for people and 
his children. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tear-filled memorial service at the First Baptist Church,  
his friends recalled Stewart's success on the golf course and how 
happy he was with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart loved life,'' said golfer Paul Azinger. ``He was  
the life of every party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was among six people killed Monday when his Learjet  
soared uncontrolled across the heartland until running out of fuel 
and plowing into a grassy field in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Before beginning his eulogy, Azinger put on a tam o'shanter cap  
and rolled up his trousers to reveal a pair of argyle socks -- 
similar to Stewart's trademark knickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger joked that only Stewart could get him to wear a suit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt pressure this morning knowing he'd be watching,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart was a vicious competitor. He only played to  
win,'' Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that Stewart's attitude had changed recently after  
finding his faith, adding: ``Only God can change hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne became gracious in victory and gracious in defeat,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger broke into tears as he said, ``Goodbye, Payne. We loved  
and we miss you, but we know we will see you again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's widow, Tracey, spoke of how she fell for him when she  
met him. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the night of our first date, I can honestly tell you this  
is the man I wanted to share the rest of my life with,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of his devotion to their son and daughter, actively  
involved in their budding interest in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will always be my soulmate and my best friend. We love  
you. Let the party in heaven begin,'' she concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour had canceled play at the Tour Championship and the  
Southern Farm Bureau Classic so players could attend the service 
for the U.S. Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that we're taking the day off so we can go to the  
service,'' said Hal Sutton, the defending champion at the Tour 
Championship in Houston. ``He deserves his day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 29 players in the Tour Championship already experienced  
the powerful emotions of paying tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first round began Thursday in Houston, players  
attended a brief but somber service on the first tee of Champions 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing 27 holes, many of them boarded private planes for  
a one-day trip to Orlando to say goodbye to Stewart one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very, very emotional for a lot of people,''  
said Davis Love III, whose father was killed in a plane crash 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Love and Tom Lehman were among those who thought about taking  
the entire week off until deciding it was best to be with their 
peers to start the grieving. After getting through a difficult day 
of golf in which the focus was far from birdies and bogeys, they 
will return to Houston on Saturday for another 27 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility exists that some will be so shook up, they will  
not want to return to Houston to resume the Tour Championship. 
</P>

	``We will see what the weekend brings,'' Love said. ``It's good  
for me to have a day off, but I don't know. You have to take each 
guy individually and see what they shot and how close they were to 
Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the European PGA Tour, players planned to pause for a moment  
of silence on the 18th green following today's round at the Volvo 
Masters in Jerez, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's impact on golf went far beyond his 18 victories around  
the world, including two U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. He was 
a member of five Ryder Cup teams and showed a passion for the 
matches like few others. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem recalled one of the last  
conversations he had with Stewart, right after the United States 
stormed from behind to win the Ryder Cup in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he had eight years left on the PGA Tour and then was  
going to play a full Senior Tour schedule,'' Finchem said. ``He was 
fully together and understood exactly where he was. He was in a 
crystal ball and could see where he was going. And I was delighted 
to know those knickers were going to be out here for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clothes were but a small part of the Stewart legacy.  
</P>
<P>
	He had the kind of flamboyant personality to wear the  
traditional golf garb -- the knickers and tam o'shanter cap often 
wore by Ben Hogan. At times, Stewart would wear a tie during 
pro-ams, which is what Walter Hagen and other great players in the 
early 20th century wore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was meticulous in the way he presented himself as a PGA  
Tour player,'' Finchem said. ``He felt so strongly about the 
importance to the presentation of our sport. He is in many ways 
irreplaceable from that perspective. He was a unique figure in 
sports and in golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For style alone, Finchem compared him to Hagen, ``a player who  
had this bigness, this presence about him, who dressed for the 
game, who brought excitement to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a substance to Stewart, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	He was perhaps the most successful player in the U.S. Open, the  
toughest championship in golf, during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won his first U.S. Open in 1991, beating Scott Simpson  
in an 18-hole playoff at Hazeltine in Minnesota. He also won in 
June at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, one of the most dramatic 
finishes in the 105-year history of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He had two other close calls in the U.S. Open, losing by two  
strokes to Lee Janzen at Baltusrol in 1993 and again finishing 
second to Janzen at The Olympic Club in San Francisco a year ago, 
when he failed to hold a 4-stroke lead going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry about me, boys,'' Stewart said at the time. ``I'll  
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept his word.

<HEADLINE> GOP Says Education Dept. Mismanaged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Education Department has a  
half-billion-dollar ``slush fund'' that could be used to offset 
proposed Republican budget spending cuts, said GOP lawmakers who 
called for a congressional investigation on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``An organization that has unauditable books clearly is ripe for  
finding 1 percent savings across the board,'' said Rep. Peter 
Hoekstra, R-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	He has asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative  
arm of Congress, to determine whether the department has mismanaged 
at least $600 million and issued duplicate checks to grant winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``The agency is responsible for distributing $35 billion in  
education spending and it cannot determine where that money is 
going,'' added Hoekstra, who chairs the House Education and the 
Workforce investigations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra and Reps. Bob Schaffer of Colorado and Matt Salmon of  
Arizona spent Friday morning at the Education Department. Arriving 
with less than a day's warning, they questioned Secretary Richard 
Riley and his deputies on an account the department maintains for 
grants that can't be awarded immediately for any of several 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said subcommittee hearings about the  
department have found no corruption or mismanagement and blasted as 
``storm trooper tactics'' the three Republicans' Friday visit on 
short notice. 
</P>
<P>
	Salmon defended the queries:  
</P>
<P>
	``If you have an account of $700 million and only $12 million to  
$13 million was put into it for the exact reason why this account 
was set up, this raises a lot of red flags,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Education Department officials say the Republicans' complaint is  
based on old numbers. Most of the $600 million Hoekstra questioned 
has since gone to the originating programs, and $147 million was 
returned to the federal Treasury. Under current law, the fund, now 
about $200 million, cannot be spent on anything else, Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawmakers had no specific examples of inappropriate ways the  
money may have been spent, citing the pending investigation. 
Hoekstra, who has grappled with Riley previously over department 
spending, added that the department was one of a several agencies 
that could not provide sufficient paperwork to the GAO to audit. 
</P>
<P>
	As a larger battle looms between the White House and Congress  
over five of the 13 spending bills that keep the government 
running, Riley and House Democrats charged the GOP with using 
gimmicks and partisan politics to push their spending plans, which 
carry a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut in federal agencies' 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's publicity stunt is an attempt to direct the focus from  
improving education,'' said Riley. He slammed the GOP-backed 
blanket-cut plan earlier this week, saying it would slice $279 
million from department programs that include funds for reading, 
mathematics and new teachers. ``I would have hoped the House would 
finally get serious about education.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoyer, a senior Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee,  
added that the GOP's 1 percent cut would apply to programs 
throughout the agencies. They would rather force Riley to cut 
programs for poor children instead of negotiating to select 
specific ways to eliminate waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all the hearings we had, never did they bring one item of  
waste, fraud abuse to be considered for cuts,'' Hoyer said. ``I 
rest my case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoekstra said his queries began about five weeks ago after  
department whistle-blowers pointed to internal documents that 
showed just $13 million of the $700 million in the grant-deposit 
fund in 1996 went toward reconciling rejected or unclaimed grants 
awarded for thousands of federal kindergarten-through-12th-grade 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressmen also pointed to $40 million in duplicate  
payments they said the department made to grantees -- including two 
$291,000 checks made last year to the University of Colorado.

<HEADLINE> Gore Criticizes Bradley Health Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBUQUE, Iowa (AP) -- Lashing out at his Democratic rival, Vice  
President Al Gore says Bill Bradley's health care proposal ``is not 
credible'' and would destroy Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also compared the plan to tax cuts being offered by  
Republicans, and linked Bradley to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the 
leader for the GOP presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both the Bradley campaign and the Bush campaign have had  
serious problems with fiscal responsibility,'' Gore said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides who spoke on condition of anonymity said Gore would  
continue to stress the issue because strategists think any threats 
to Medicare will unsettle Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after his first debate with Bradley, Gore launched a  
broad-based assault that sharpened the criticisms of his 
presidential rival offered at that appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with about 200 people at a senior community center, Gore  
warned that Bradley's proposal to help the elderly pay for 
prescription drugs is inadequate and would force them to pay up to 
$800 in premiums and deductibles before getting any help. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's competing plan, with a similar $24 monthly premium, would  
give seniors up to $1,000 each year to pay half their drug costs. 
Bradley would impose no upper limit on help for seniors with 
catastrophic or chronic illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaigning in New Hampshire, Bradley pointedly noted that Gore  
has yet to detail the costs of most of his own proposals. ``I think 
it's important to do that if you're going to be honest with the 
American public,'' Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, asked by reporters afterward if he sensed Bradley was  
vulnerable on the issue, declined to answer directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Medicare is a huge issue,'' he said. ``I think most  
people assume that serious campaigns will treat it with care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley has said that some of the financing for his plan will  
come from replacing cumbersome paperwork with more efficient 
computer links. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gore said, ``It's just not a credible plan in my opinion.''  
</P>
<P>
	He said independent studies of Bradley's proposal were  
``genuinely surprising'' because of the amount of the surplus that 
would be spent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Bradley's plan definitely puts the future of Medicare  
at risk,'' said Gore, who wants to reserve $256 billion of the 
projected 10-year surplus to shore up Medicare for the baby boom. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley spokesman Eric Hauser replied: ``You obviously have to  
keep an eye on it, but the trend of the Medicare Trust Fund is in 
good shape. ... On balance, we don't think we have to do anything 
to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore rejected suggestions that his own spending proposals also  
could eat up the entire budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are keeping a running total on every single promise we  
make,'' Gore said. ``I will integrate all of them into a balanced 
budget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Bradley has closed the gap in polls in key early states such  
as Iowa and New Hampshire, Gore has become more aggressive in 
challenging his proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue resonates well in Iowa, which has a large number of  
seniors, and Gore was questioned closely about the issue during 
Thursday's session. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls have shown Gore with a lead in the state, but Bradley has  
moved within striking distance.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged With Cruise Sex Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- An Italian citizen has been charged with sexual  
misconduct over an incident involving an American woman while the 
two were passengers on a cruise ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal indictment accuses Salvatore DeRosa of Naples,  
Italy, of committing abusive sexual contact on Oct. 16 during a 
voyage of the Carnival Cruise Line's MS Destiny in U.S. territorial 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Details about the alleged incident were not disclosed in a  
statement released Thursday by the U.S. Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear if DeRosa was already in custody, or if officials  
would decide to seek him abroad. The charge can carry a six-month 
prison term and a fine of up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The charge comes three months after Carnival officials released  
a report saying 108 sexual assaults had been committed aboard its 
ships over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a policy enacted by the International Council of Cruise  
Lines in July, the same month the Carnival report was released, all 
crimes allegedly committed aboard cruise ships must be reported to 
the FBI. Previously, victims were expected to report crimes once 
they arrived back in port.

<HEADLINE> IRS Promises No Major Y2K Delays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The IRS said difficulties in keeping track of  
its equipment have complicated efforts to deal with the Y2K 
computer problem but promised no major delays in sending out tax 
refund checks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y2K has finally given us the push to solve a long-standing  
problem,'' IRS spokesman Paul Cosgrave said Friday. That problem 
was how to keep accurate records of 800,000 pieces of equipment in 
IRS offices around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrave, the agency's chief information officer, joined  
officials from the departments of Defense and Energy, the Social 
Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service before a joint 
House hearing to describe their contingency plans for Y2K failures 
and their preparations for the ``Day One'' period immediately 
before and after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	All the agencies said they have modified their computers so they  
will not mistake the year 2000 for 1900, and officials anticipate 
no serious disruptions. They also said they had taken elaborate 
steps, in line with White House instructions, to prepare for 
unexpected problems. 
</P>
<P>
	John Dyer of the Social Security Administration said agency  
computers will shut down early on Dec. 30 to allow collection of 
all 1999 computer transactions. Then, he said, the main data center 
in Baltimore will switch to jet-fueled generators just before 
midnight on the 31st to guard against electrical surges. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Lorentz, chief technology officer of the Postal Service,  
said his agency placed a freeze on all computer system changes 
through March and will have a National Operations Center monitoring 
systems from Dec. 30 through Jan. 4. He said they expect more 
people to mail letters because of the possible unreliability of 
e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Martin Langston, the Pentagon's top Y2K official, said the  
Defense Department will have an extra 5 percent to 10 percent of 
personnel on duty over the New Year. Russian military personnel 
will be arriving Dec. 22 in Colorado Springs, Colo., for a joint 
exercise in assuring that problems in early-warning tracking 
systems don't lead to mistaken perceptions that the other side has 
launched a missile. 
</P>
<P>
	The focus on the IRS came from an Oct. 15 letter from  
Commissioner Charles Rossotti to House Ways and Means Committee 
Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas. In the letter, Rossotti said, ``The 
quality of the IRS' inventory currently poses a high risk to the 
Y2K effort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added the agency has acted to improve the accuracy of  
inventories and that ``if problems surface when the clocks roll 
over into the new year, we will be prepared to deal with them 
before they begin to affect taxpayers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cosgrave said the tax agency has been working 15 years on its  
problem of highly decentralized inventories. The accuracy record 
has improved from 50 percent to 90 percent, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 99 percent of IRS computer systems that are vital to  
accomplishing the agency's mission have been cleared to handle the 
Y2K problem, and many of the systems already are successfully 
tested during the 1999 filing season. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS would resort to issuing refunds manually if automatic  
systems should fail, but that should pose no problem since the 
agency doesn't begin to send out a large number of refunds until 
the end of January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Problems could arise well into the new year, he said, and the  
IRS Year 2000 Command Center will continue to operate through the 
filing deadline of April 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House office on the Y2K problem, led by John Koskinen,  
also is to run an information coordination center to monitor any 
Y2K problems in the public and private sector as the new year 
begins.

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Strickland Innocent of DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington Wizards guard Rod Strickland was  
acquitted Friday of all charges stemming from an April 24 traffic 
stop in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood. A jury of seven men and 
five women deliberated for five hours before finding the NBA 
standout innocent of a charge of driving under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very happy, obviously,'' Strickland said after signing  
autographs and shaking hands with several members of the jury. 
Strickland, 33, spent three days at DC Superior Court while the 
rest of the Wizards prepared for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My priorities are getting in shape and getting ready to play  
basketball,'' Strickland said. The Wizards open the season at home 
Tuesday against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's latest problems with the law occurred in the early  
hours of the morning following the Hawks' last appearance in the 
nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	He was stopped by district police after he allegedly ran three  
traffic lights at high speed. An officer testified that Strickland 
was driving down a city street as though ``he was on a NASCAR 
racetrack,'' and weaving through slower traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel that they proved he was intoxicated,'' Dottie  
Wade, forewoman of the jury, said. Wade said that many members of 
the jury did not know Strickland was a member of the Wizards until 
the trial began. 
</P>
<P>
	``His judgment was impaired by the second beer he drank,''  
prosecutor Anthony M. Gagliardi told jurors during closing 
arguments. He said Strickland's failure of three field sobriety 
tests and his refusal to submit to breathalyzer or blood tests was 
evidence of his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had no evidence,'' said Lois Graves, one of several  
jurors who admitted that they considered the test results flawed 
because of the way they were administered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police did not meet the standard,'' for proving  
impairment, lawyer Michael V. Statham said. A conviction could have 
resulted in a one-year jail sentence and a fine of up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge William Jackson also acquitted Strickland  
of a separate reckless driving charge that carried a possible 
penalty of 90 days in jail and a $250 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was convicted in April of 1998 for driving while  
impaired. He completed a year's probation and attended an alcohol 
education program as part of that sentence.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Say British Beef Is Safe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- A panel of European Union scientists  
ruled today that British beef was safe for export, rejecting French 
scientific arguments to continue a ban because of fears of mad cow 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The Scientific Steering Committee ``concluded unanimously that  
it does not share the concerns expressed by the French food safety 
agency about the safety of the meats and meat product exported buy 
the UK,'' an EU statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meat and meat products exported from the UK ... are as safe as  
those in other European member states,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee said ``there are no grounds for revising'' the EU  
decision to lift the ban on British beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists concluded that ``it is clear that the decline of  
the (British mad cow) epidemic continues in line with scientific 
expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It rejected French claims that there are new or unknown routes  
for mad cow infections. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will weigh heavily on whether the Commission will  
take France to court for banning British beef -- an issue that has 
driven up tempers on both sides of the Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef in 1996 after an  
outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalapathy, commonly known as mad 
cow disease. BSE has been linked to a similar brain wasting malady 
in humans called Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. 
</P>
<P>
	That ban was lifted in August and British beef declared safe  
after Britain fulfilled certain measures. But on Oct. 1, France 
imposed its own ban and presented the Commission with a scientific 
report claiming new evidence to back its action. 
</P>
<P>
	The British insist there is no new evidence and Foreign  
Secretary Robin Cook said in London that Britain fully expected to 
win its case before the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have got science on our side, the evidence on our side and  
the law on our side,'' he said. ``We have a strong case because we 
know that British beef is safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	France is equally adamant that it has a right to impose the ban.  
</P>
<P>
	Still, Paris has suggested there may be a compromise solution.  
</P>
<P>
	``The way out of the crisis is perhaps to lift the embargo, add  
stipulations and make inspections more strict,'' French Agriculture 
Minister Jean Glavany told France Inter radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``In any case, that is what we will ask the Commission when the  
time comes to explore it,'' Glavany said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fritz Kamper, a German member of the committee, said the role of  
the scientific advisory group was not to make political decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we do here is purely scientific,'' he said, ``but the  
background is a political one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The scientific committee's decision obliges the Commission to  
take action against France if it maintain the ban. That could mean 
dragging the French before the European Court of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Some British retailers have begun boycotting French products and  
angry French farmers have been stopping British trucks and checking 
them for meat products.

<HEADLINE> Report: Saudis Finance bin Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Osama bin Laden continues to receive help  
from businessmen in Saudi Arabia who are transferring tens of 
millions of dollars to bank accounts linked to the accused 
terrorist, U.S. intelligence officials told USA Today. 
</P>
<P>
	The money was deposited into accounts of Islamic charities,  
including Islamic Relief and Blessed Relief, that serve as fronts 
for bin Laden, the newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	A Saudi government audit obtained by U.S. intelligence shows  
that five top Saudi Arabian businessmen ordered the National 
Commercial Bank, the kingdom's largest, to transfer personal funds 
and $3 million from a Saudi pension fund to New York and London 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden, whose family runs the largest construction company in  
Saudi Arabia, has called for the overthrow of the Saudi government. 
USA Today quoted the further unidentified U.S. intelligence 
officials as saying the payments are ``protection money'' aimed at 
staving off attacks on the businessmen's properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The money transfers were discovered in August after the Saudi  
royal family ordered an audit of the National Commercial Bank and 
its founder and former chairman, Khalid bin Mahfouz, the U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahfouz is now under house arrest in the Saudi city of Taif. His  
successor, Mohammed Hussein Al-Amoudi, also heads the Capitol Trust 
Bank in New York and London, which is being investigated by U.S. 
and British officials for allegedly transferring money to bin 
Laden, USA Today said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, Al-Amoudi's attorneys said he has no knowledge of  
the acts alleged in the story and does not know bin Laden. 
Al-Amoudi ``has never knowingly had dealings of any kind with Osama 
bin Laden,'' the firm of Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer &AMP; Feld said in 
a statement. ``Sheik Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi does not have any 
knowledge of any money transfers by Saudi businesses to Osama bin 
Laden (and) is unalterably opposed to terrorism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Dubill, executive editor of USA Today, would not comment on  
the lawyers' statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden has been indicted by a U.S. grand jury on charges of  
ordering the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania 
that killed 224 people. Bin Laden, believed to be living in 
Afghanistan, has denied the charges.

<HEADLINE> White House Advocates Nuke Monitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Any move to cut U.S. financing for a global  
monitoring system to detect nuclear tests clearly would damage U.S. 
national security, the White House said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $300 million International Monitoring System, eventually to  
comprise 321 stations in 90 countries, is part of the enforcement 
mechanism for a treaty to stop all nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the Senate's Oct. 13 rejection of the  
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, however, some test-ban opponents 
have questioned the system's value and whether the United States 
should continue to help pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue: a $16 million U.S. installment for the fiscal year  
that began Oct. 1, part of a $12.6 billion foreign aid bill that 
President Clinton vetoed on unrelated grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, as Congress tries to piece together a new version of the  
legislation, conservative congressional staff members are proposing 
elimination of the monitoring allocation. 
</P>
<P>
	David Leavy, a White House spokesman on national security  
issues, called such a proposal ``clearly damaging to our national 
security, and it makes no sense whatsoever in terms of America's 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After voting down the CTBT, to say we don't care if anyone  
else is testing is a ludicrous position,'' Leavy said. 
``Dismantling this monitoring system is to eliminate one of the 
tools we have already to watch what's happening around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system is roughly one-third complete, with about 100  
stations already built. 
</P>
<P>
	Its role is to collect information and provide it to member  
states who are signatories to the test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's assertion the day after the Senate vote that he would  
continue to abide by terms of the treaty angered some Senate 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times published the first report Friday on the  
movement to cut money for the monitors. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said the plan was being advanced by a group of  
senior Republican aides who are specialists in national security 
and who were involved in the Senate's rejection of the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior GOP official who is familiar with the effort said no  
decision has been made whether to recommend cutting the money. 
</P>
<P>
	But the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
United States has its own monitoring stations and other ways to 
discover clandestine nuclear testing, including sophisticated 
aircraft with sensing devices, and does not need to participate in 
the global network. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget negotiators have been seeking to increase  
money for other programs designed to reduce nuclear threats, 
including ones to offer civilian jobs to former Russian nuclear 
scientists and to help Russia safeguard its nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting funds for the monitoring system could provoke another  
presidential veto, Democratic congressional and administration 
aides suggested.

<HEADLINE> Big Waves Kill Bride in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PACIFIC GROVE, Calif. (AP) -- Giant waves swept a woman to her  
death as her husband took her picture at Lovers Point on the final 
day of their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Eamon and Jennifer Stookesberry were standing on rocks by the  
shore when 10-foot waves crashed over them Thursday. He dove in 
after his wife but never reached her. The stormy seas tossed them 
about 50 yards from shore, a Coast Guard spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers first pulled Stookesberry, 28, from the 56 degree water  
into their boat, then got to Mrs. Stookesberry, 23. She was 
pronounced dead at a hospital. Her husband was treated for 
hypothermia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stookesberrys were taking pictures from a rocky outcropping  
called Lovers Point, just beyond a stand of Monterey cypress trees 
that reach 40 to 50 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	``The spray was up over the top of those trees,'' said Dorothy  
Maras-Ildiz, manager of the nearby Old Bath House restaurant. 
``I've seen some big surf before but nothing like that. Landlubbers 
don't understand the force. Rule one is you never turn your back on 
the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maras-Ildiz called 911 after a man came running to her  
restaurant and said two people were in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Stookesbury tried to direct rescuers to his wife but they  
couldn't get to the couple from shore because the sea was too 
rough, she said. They had to wait for the boat instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Maras-Ildiz said she saw Mrs. Stookesberry swimming for 10 to 12  
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	``But then a huge set of waves came up, three or four of them,  
one behind the other and I thought, oh no, because she was getting 
weaker. And then, a few minutes later, we saw her floating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, a bouquet of yellow spider mums lay across the  
computer keyboard at Mrs. Stookesberry's desk in an Alamo doctors' 
office where she worked as a receptionist. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Drew Nash, a pediatrician who officiated at the wedding on  
Saturday, was preparing for her funeral as a grief counselor was 
talked with her co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nash spoke of a ``sweet, charming and bright individual'' who  
could do six things at once, let stress melt away and smile. She 
wanted to become a doctor and planned to start classes in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, rescuers up and down the California coast were busy  
Thursday as a sea storm worked its way south from Pacific Grove, 
about 85 miles south of San Francisco, hitting the Santa Cruz and 
Monterey areas right around high tide. The storm spawned giant 
waves that crashed under sunny skies amid balmy temperatures, 
luring big-wave surfers to the water. 
</P>
<P>
	Several got in trouble. The Coast Guard in Monterey knew of four  
surfers in distress at the same time. ``Between the radios and the 
phones, it was nonstop,'' Petty Officer Robert Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Jordan, 20, of San Jose, died after surfing near Capitola.

<HEADLINE> Mariah Carey Bolts From CBS Concert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Less than a week before its premiere, CBS's  
``The Early Show'' was delivered a big-time snub by Mariah Carey. 
</P>
<P>
	The pop diva backed out of a concert scheduled to give a flashy  
launch to the morning show next Monday and, to make matters worse, 
decided to sing instead for CBS's rival, the top-rated ``Today'' 
show on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The diva's dance between the two shows suggests just how nasty  
competition for big-name guests is likely to get in television's 
morning news wars. 
</P>
<P>
	Carey, who agreed to the concert to promote a new album due out  
Tuesday, pulled out of ``The Early Show'' late Wednesday because 
she was nervous about CBS's ability to get a city permit for the 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Friedman, senior executive producer for ``The Early  
Show,'' brushed off the switch with a dig at his NBC rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We not only have to book our own show, but we have to help the  
others come up with their ideas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS had grand plans to shut down a portion of Manhattan's Fifth  
Avenue for the concert, but the plans kept getting scaled back, 
said Larry Jenkins, spokesman for Columbia Records. The event 
couldn't be publicized until the permit was secured, so an 
ultimatum was issued: no permit by the end of the day Wednesday, no 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5:45 p.m., Carey bolted. Within an hour, she was booked on  
``Today.'' A permit was issued shortly thereafter, but it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing we have done either maliciously or  
intentionally,'' Jenkins said. ``But we have an artist with an 
album coming out next week and it is our responsibility to find the 
best situation for her. We agonized over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Today'' was only too happy to accommodate Carey, even though  
executive producer Jeff Zucker had publicly vowed not to book 
guests aligned with Pat Kingsley, a partner in Carey's public 
relations firm, after Kingsley client Calista Flockhart backed out 
of a summer appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	Show spokeswoman Allison Gollust said the ban applied only to  
Kingsley's personal clients, not to all people represented by her 
firm, PMK. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's a chance to stick it to `The Early Show,'''  
Gollust said Thursday. ``There's no question a Mariah Carey concert 
would be a lot of fun, not only for guests of our show but our 
viewers. We would be silly to pass it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS, meanwhile, is left with a concert permit, but no artist.  
Friedman wouldn't say what ``The Early Show'' would do for a 
replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life goes on,'' he said. ``This is not some major thing that's  
going to change the face of Monday morning. It's our premiere, 
people will watch us to see what we're doing. If we're good, fine. 
If we're not, Mariah Carey couldn't have saved us.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Rise Sharply / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices surged for a second consecutive day  
Friday, bolstered by fresh evidence of a cooling economy that 
seemed to decrease the likelihood the Federal Reserve will 
repeatedly raise interest rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which rose 1  
1/32 points on Thursday, jumped another 1 5/32 points, or $11.56 
per $1,000 invested. Its yield, which moves inversely to the price, 
fell to 6.16 percent from 6.25 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors snapped up bonds after news that new-home sales posted  
the biggest plunge in more than five years last month as 
prospective buyers were put off by rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said Friday that sales of new  
single-family homes fell 12.8 percent last month to a seasonally 
adjusted annual rate of 811,000 units, much weaker than many 
analysts expected. It was the largest drop since January 1994, when 
sales plummeted by 24 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The news eased investor concerns that Fed policy-makers would  
find it necessary to raise interest rates repeatedly to defuse 
inflationary pressures, even if they raise rates again at a Nov. 16 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher rates tend to erode the value of already owned bonds and  
other fixed-rate securities. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices for short-term securities rose  
5/32 point to 7/32 point, while intermediate treasury securities 
rose 11/32 point to 23/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.08 percent as the  
discount held at Wednesday's 4.95 percent. Six-month yields were 
5.27 percent, as the discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 5.06 
percent. One-year yields were 5.40 percent as the discount fell 
0.05 percentage point to 5.12 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, fell to 5.25 percent from 5.31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 29/32 to 109 7/16. The average yield to 
maturity fell to 6.08 percent from 6.14 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Senior Golfers Remember Stewart  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Gathering to the music of a bagpipe player,  
PGA Senior Tour players held a memorial service for Payne Stewart 
on the 10th green at the Wilshire Country Club on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very emotional day for most of the players. There  
wasn't just one thing I remember about Payne. There was a 
collection,'' Gary McCord said as players and spectators crowded 
around the green following the first round of the Pacific Bell 
Seniors tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``First, there was always that grin. It always cheered you up.  
He always had a twinkle in his eye,'' McCord said. ``You would 
always have the thought that he knew something you didn't. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Hubert Green said, ``I loved him on the course, I loved him off  
the course. This is really hard for me to stomach. We lost a great 
person. Payne, we'll never forget you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raymond Floyd followed Green to the microphone on the green and  
had difficulty fighting back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Such a tragic loss to golf and we lost a friend,'' Floyd said.  
``He brought grace and dignity to the game. He was caring, loving, 
sharing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd recalled Stewart as his teammate on the 1989 Ryder Cup  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somewhere in the Belfry in the middle of England, Payne had a  
boom box. He'd go running up and down the halls, pounding on our 
doors to make sure we heard Bruce Springsteen singing `Born in the 
U.S.A.,''' Floyd said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hale Irwin said Stewart left a legacy for the sport.  
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we can all take away something from his examples -- have  
a great life, enjoy it, have fun while you are at it -- imprinted on 
all of us,'' Irwin said.

<HEADLINE> 'Cabaret' Still Running Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Some musicals keep getting better and better;  
others stumble right from the start. 
</P>
<P>
	On Broadway, ``Cabaret'' remains the toughest, most  
uncompromising musical in town. Now on view at Studio 54, the show 
revels in a theatricality that director Sam Mendes has managed to 
maintain in the nearly 20 months the revival has been running on 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
	Off-Broadway, ``Stars in Your Eyes'' suffers from too few cooks  
spoiling the broth. Chip Meyrelles provided the book, music and 
lyrics for this earnestly romantic show playing at the tiny Cherry 
Lane Theater. He should have delegated at least one of these 
duties, preferably the book. 
</P>
<P>
	First, ``Cabaret,'' at Studio 54. The one-time disco shrine is  
the perfect home for Mendes' high-concept version that places the 
audience in the Kit Kat Klub, a rundown nightclub in pre-World War 
II Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	Theatergoers sitting at tiny tables watch the antics of Sally  
Bowles and company as Germany parties its way to oblivion. The new 
cast members in this Roundabout Theater Company production are a 
potent group of celebrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among them is Susan Egan, a slip of an actress whose  
powerhouse voice scorches listeners with a terrifying version of 
the title song. Her rendition will change the way you hear it from 
now on. Her Sally is defiantly, almost strenuously hedonistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Egan is the perfect foil for all-American Michael Hayden, who  
plays the boyish, bisexual writer Clifford Bradshaw with awkward 
charm to spare. 
</P>
<P>
	At the center of the show's entertainment stands -- or should we  
say slinks -- the emcee, now being played by Michael Hall. If the 
original master of ceremonies, Alan Cumming, was an obscene, seedy 
spright, Hall is a bigger, beefy and even more decadent creature. 
</P>
<P>
	The show's heart lies in the doomed romance between Fraulein  
Schneider, the practical landlady on Nollendorfstrasse, and Jewish 
fruit merchant Herr Schultz. The wonderful Carole Shelley inhabits 
the woman better than any of her predecessors. Laurence Luckinbill 
brings a gentle sorrow to the role of her suitor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kit Kat Klub boys and girls are as lewd as ever -- and so is  
the orchestra, which wails away at the classic Kander and Ebb 
score. ``Cabaret'' could not be in better hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The same can be said for ``Stars in Your Eyes,'' but the results  
are much less satisfying. Despite a terrific cast, the musical 
never rises much above the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyrelles' music is promising, with several melodies persistent  
enough to perhaps find a life outside the theater. His lyrics are 
more ordinary and the plot could be called, well, comfortably 
predictable. There's not much suspense as a parade of characters 
match up with the right mates. The score may sound better on a cast 
recording than surrounded by the soupy story Meyrelles has 
concocted. 
</P>
<P>
	In ``Stars,'' there actually is a man in the moon (the jaunty  
James Stovall), who looks down on the insipid doings of the several 
pairs of would-be lovers. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Gabriel Barre puts a fine company through their paces  
with ease. Besides Stovall, this gallant group of performers 
includes the lovely Barbara Walsh, Crista Moore, Heather MacRae, 
John Braden, David M. Lutken and Christy Carlson Romano. They go 
about their business with impeccable professionalism, if not 
exactly stars in their eyes.

<HEADLINE> Wizards' Strickland Innocent of DUI </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington Wizards guard Rod Strickland was  
acquitted Friday of all charges stemming from an April 24 traffic 
stop in a Washington, D.C., neighborhood. A jury of seven men and 
five women deliberated for five hours before finding the NBA 
standout innocent of a charge of driving under the influence of 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very happy, obviously,'' Strickland said after signing  
autographs and shaking hands with several members of the jury. 
Strickland, 33, spent three days at DC Superior Court while the 
rest of the Wizards prepared for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My priorities are getting in shape and getting ready to play  
basketball,'' Strickland said. The Wizards open the season at home 
Tuesday against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's latest problems with the law occurred in the early  
hours of the morning following the Hawks' last appearance in the 
nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	He was stopped by district police after he allegedly ran three  
traffic lights at high speed. An officer testified that Strickland 
was driving down a city street as though ``he was on a NASCAR 
racetrack,'' and weaving through slower traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't feel that they proved he was intoxicated,'' Dottie  
Wade, forewoman of the jury, said. Wade said that many members of 
the jury did not know Strickland was a member of the Wizards until 
the trial began. 
</P>
<P>
	``His judgment was impaired by the second beer he drank,''  
prosecutor Anthony M. Gagliardi told jurors during closing 
arguments. He said Strickland's failure of three field sobriety 
tests and his refusal to submit to breathalyzer or blood tests was 
evidence of his guilt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had no evidence,'' said Lois Graves, one of several  
jurors who admitted that they considered the test results flawed 
because of the way they were administered. 
</P>
<P>
	``The police did not meet the standard,'' for proving  
impairment, lawyer Michael V. Statham said. A conviction could have 
resulted in a one-year jail sentence and a fine of up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge William Jackson also acquitted Strickland  
of a separate reckless driving charge that carried a possible 
penalty of 90 days in jail and a $250 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland was convicted in April of 1998 for driving while  
impaired. He completed a year's probation and attended an alcohol 
education program as part of that sentence.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Gets Tough Draw in Paris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Pete Sampras will launch his comeback from injury  
at next week's Paris Open against either Francisco Clavet of Spain 
or the Czech Republic's Jiri Novak, following Friday's draw. 
</P>
<P>
	The former world No. 1 and two-time Paris Open winner, out of  
action for two months because of a strained right hip and herniated 
disk, got a tough draw for the $2.55 million event. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-seeded Sampras, who has a first-round bye, could face  
either 13th-seeded Tommy Haas of Germany or French Open 
semifinalist Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia in a third-round match. 
</P>
<P>
	If Sampras advances, defending champion Greg Rusedski stands in  
his way in what would be a repeat of last year's final, which the 
British player won 6-4, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Top-seeded Andre Agassi, the 1994 champion, is also in the same  
half of the draw as Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
	The French and U.S. Open winner also gets a bye into the second  
round, where he will play either countryman Vincent Spadea or 
Morocco's Younes El Aynaoui. Slovakia's Karol Kucera, seeded 16th, 
could play Agassi in the third round.

<HEADLINE> Seabrooks Reinstated at Pitt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Pittsburgh forward Chris Seabrooks, arrested  
last week for aggravated assault, was reinstated to the basketball 
team Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad that this matter is resolved and that Chris will  
resume practicing and playing with our team again,'' coach Ben 
Howland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Hill, Pitt's executive director of public affairs,  
declined to say how Seabrooks' criminal charge was resolved by the 
Allegheny County District Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	During a criminal hearing Friday, Seabrooks pleaded guilty to a  
charge less severe than aggravated assault, WPXI-TV reported. The 
station reported that Seabrooks received a 90-day suspended 
sentence and was ordered to perform 100 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hill said the university would continue with a non-criminal  
disciplinary hearing for Seabrooks. The charge filed by University 
of Pittsburgh police stemmed from an alleged assault Sept. 10 
outside the school's student union.

<HEADLINE> Tyson To Receive $8.7M Purse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Mike Tyson escaped punishment from Nevada  
boxing authorities today and will receive his $8.7 million purse 
from his abbreviated bout with Orlin Norris. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson did not escape, however, without some harsh words. One  
member of the Nevada State Athletic Commission suggested he fight 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not so sure we need him in the state of Nevada any  
longer,'' commissioner Lorenzo Fertitta said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former heavyweight champion did not attend the 30-minute  
hearing. The commission upheld referee Richard Steele's action, 
deducting two points from Tyson as the sole punishment for hitting 
Norris after the bell at the end of the first round of Saturday's 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris fell, dislocated his knee and was unable to continue.  
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners could have fined Tyson or they could have changed  
the decision from a no contest to a disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission chairman Dr. Elias Ghanem warned Tyson's  
representatives that he will face a tough time getting licensed 
again when his Nevada boxing license expires at the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to watch him closely,'' Ghanem said. ``But I don't  
think he'll ask to fight here for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steele's ruling in the ring that the left hook that dropped  
Norris after the bell sounded was not deliberate was the key factor 
in Tyson avoiding any penalties for the late blow, which ended the 
fight when Norris dislocated his knee on the way down to the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	``He made the call right there and the call was appropriate,''  
commissioner Glen Carano said. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to the long hearings a year ago that won Tyson his  
license back after being banned by Nevada authorities from boxing 
for biting Evander Holyfield's ears, today's hearing lasted only a 
half hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners voted 4-0 to give Tyson back the $8.7 million  
purse that was withheld when the fight ended in confusion after 
Norris could not go on. Norris got his $201,000 purse the night of 
the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, commissioners voiced frustration that a Tyson issue was  
before them again, and questioned whether he could behave himself 
in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's attorney, Jim Jimmerson, assured them he could.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was the heat of the moment, the intensity of the moment,''  
Jimmerson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmerson also noted that no other fighters had been disciplined  
for hitting after the bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson's promoter, Dan Goossen, said he was already looking at  
having Tyson fight somewhere other than Nevada. Tyson may fight 
again in December, then is tentatively scheduled to fight Shannon 
Briggs Feb. 26 at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looking to take Mike out of the state of Nevada and go  
other places including out of the country,'' Goossen said. ``Those 
plans are still on the table.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tyson was not required to attend today's commission hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	He said after the fight that he did not hear the bell, even  
though it rang five times as Steele moved in to try and separate 
the fighters in the middle of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioners said there was no dispute that Tyson hit Norris  
after the bell, but he noted that hitting after the bell is 
relatively common in fights. Felix Trinidad did the same thing to 
Oscar De La Hoya twice in the middle rounds of their welterweight 
title fight last month, and was not penalized. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI showed Norris' knee was dislocated, and doctors said  
Norris may need surgery.

<HEADLINE> CBA Team Signs Two Former Huskies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AVON, Conn. (AP) -- Donny Marshall and Ricky Moore are again  
calling Connecticut home. 
</P>
<P>
	The former University of Connecticut players said Friday they  
will play for the Connecticut Pride of the Continental Basketball 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall, a 1995 UConn graduate, was a second-round draft pick  
of Cleveland. In his two seasons with the Cavaliers, he averaged 
just under 3.0 points per game. He averaged 15.8 points and 5.8 
rebounds as a senior at UConn. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore is a defensive specialist who helped the Huskies to their  
first ever NCAA Championship in March. He played in a 
record-setting 134 games during his career at UConn, averaging 6.9 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pride, who are the defending CBA champions, begin their  
season on Nov. 19.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Tax Break Continuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With no dissent, the Senate today approved  
legislation to extend $8.5 billion in expiring tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would continue an existing research and development  
tax credit and ensure that millions of average taxpayers who claim 
numerous personal tax credits do not get tangled up in the 
alternative minimum tax in 1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions relate to employer-provided educational  
assistance, a welfare-to-work tax credit and extension of a credit 
for electricity produced from wind and closed-loop biomass. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the bill, all provisions would expire Dec. 31, 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	Similar legislation is pending in the House, and lawmakers  
intend to send a measure to President Clinton for his signature 
before Congress adjourns for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure differs in significant detail from the  
five-year, $23.3 billion House bill. The House would extend the 
research and development tax credit for five years and make 
permanent the changes in the alternative minimum tax.

<HEADLINE> Arizona State Tailback Is Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona State tailback J.R. Redmond was suspended  
by the NCAA for Saturday's game against Oregon as the result of a 
bizarre situation that involved his marriage to a student who 
worked part-time in the Sun Devils' athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond must pay $418 in cellular telephone bills and $173 for a  
plane trip to Las Vegas plus perform 20 hours of community service. 
The money is to go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond subsequently has filed for divorce from the woman, whose  
name was not made public by the university. The woman reportedly is 
seeking a share of Redmond's future earnings as part of the divorce 
settlement, athletic department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond's future earning potential is considerable, since he is  
a top NFL prospect. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona State's appeal of the one-game suspension was denied by  
the NCAA on Friday, which led to the situation being made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond did not accompany the team to Eugene, Ore., but would  
have flown there and played if the appeal had been accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	The university, in consultation with the Pac-10 Conference,  
reported the matter to the NCAA when the situation came to light 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Concerns arose related to who is permitted to provide benefits  
to a student-athlete,'' ASU athletic director Kevin White said in a 
statement. ``Therefore, the conference and the institution reviewed 
the direct relationship of the parties involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the institution's information, the NCAA determined  
that the benefits did not come from an approved source.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the university's report to the NCAA, Redmond  
developed a relationship with the female student who was a 
part-time athletic department worker, and she allowed him to use 
her cellular phone. After he made several calls, she told him that 
what he had done violated NCAA rules and the only way he could 
rectify the matter was to marry her, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic department officials said Redmond married the student  
on Aug. 25, and the couple flew to Las Vegas for the honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
	When word of the arrangement reached athletic department  
officials this week, the investigation began. The part-time worker 
submitted her resignation to the athletic department on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The university investigated a report that the woman had done a  
paper for one of Redmond's classes. While she may have typed the 
paper, there was no evidence she composed it, and it wasn't part of 
the violation that resulted in the NCAA penalty, athletic 
department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, a senior, was mentioned as a possible Heisman Trophy  
contender before the start of each of the last two seasons but has 
been slowed by injuries. He is fourth on Arizona State's career 
rushing list with 2,684 yards and 28 touchdowns in 39 games. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, he has rushed for 739 yards, averaging 5.1 yards  
per carry. Last week, he carried a career-high 35 times for 165 
yards in the Sun Devils' victory over Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
	The athletic department said Redmond would not comment on the  
situation under advice from his lawyer because of the pending 
divorce proceeding. Redmond missed a practice this week because of 
a migraine headache.

<HEADLINE> Levi Strauss &AMP; Co To Stop Web Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. will stop selling its  
products online through its own Web sites, just a year after the 
struggling jeans maker launched its Internet business. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement, which was made Friday, is the latest trouble  
plaguing Levi's, which has struggled in recent years with sagging 
sales and has looked for new outlets to promote its goods. 
</P>
<P>
	After Christmas, Levi's clothing and accessories -- such as  
jeans, khakis, hats and belts -- will be sold only on Web sites 
operated by J.C. Penney and Macy's, two of Levi's biggest 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's spokesman Jeff Beckman said Levi's may continue selling  
limited edition or other special products on its site. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's said that sales at www.levi.com and www.dockers.com have  
been strong, but costs remain high. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now the cost of running a world-class e-commerce  
business is unaffordable considering our competing priorities,'' 
Beckman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's has watched its sales decline in recent years as  
teen-agers began shunning its classic five-pocket blue jeans for 
trendier styles by rival designers. After a peak of $7.1 billion in 
1996, sales dropped to $6.9 billion in 1997 and to $6 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Levi's launched its online stores, saying they were  
an easy way to learn more about its consumers and keep in touch 
with their ever-changing desires. But the move angered the 
company's key retail partners, who were forbidden from selling 
Levi's and Dockers over the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Levi's isn't alone. Many manufacturers are struggling with how  
to handle the Internet -- whether to exclusively sell merchandise 
themselves or allow retailers to offer their brands online. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last week, Nike announced it would take orders for  
customized shoes online and deliver them directly to homes, 
bypassing retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Allen, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in Cambridge,  
Mass. said Levi's is setting a trend in the wrong direction by 
giving in to retailers and backing away from the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an opportunity to broaden their distribution channels,''  
she said. ``There are ways to assuage the concerns of retailers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the costs of operating an online store can be high,  
especially for manufacturers who aren't used to dealing with issues 
like customer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``E-commerce can be a tremendous distraction to your core  
business,'' said Candace Corlett of New York-based WSL Strategic 
Retail. ``It was a very precipitous move on the part of a weak 
company to try to take on their retailers.''

<HEADLINE> Ricky Martin Urges End to Navy Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Puerto Rican pop star Ricky Martin  
has a message for President Clinton: Stop bombing runs on the 
territory's island of Vieques. 
</P>
<P>
	``Puerto Rico is united in this cause and I'm part of it,''  
Martin said in Friday's El Mundo newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' singer has a tentative meeting  
scheduled next week with Clinton when he is in Washington for a 
benefit concert. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy owns two-thirds of Vieques, a tiny island off the  
eastern coast of Puerto Rico. The military has conducted exercises 
using live bombs and other artillery on Vieques for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the bombing intensified in April when a Marine  
Corps jet dropped two bombs off target and killed a civilian 
security guard. Exercises were suspended after protesters set up 
camps on the range.

<HEADLINE> Bruins Sign Goalie to 3-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Boston Bruins goaltender Byron Dafoe ended his  
holdout on Friday, signing a three-year contract that could have 
him back in goal as soon as next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Four or five practices and I should be ready to go,'' said  
Dafoe, who has been skating every day on his own in preparation for 
his anticipated return. ``I want to play as soon as possible, and I 
want to make sure that I'm at the highest level before I enter a 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations have been stalled for months. But as the season  
progressed Dafoe felt an urgency that led him to call general 
manager Harry Sinden on Friday morning to request a meeting. After 
40 minutes, the two had a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it wasn't going to get done in a day or two, I was going to  
look elsewhere,'' Dafoe said during an afternoon news conference. 
``I called up Harry today and came in and got the deal done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The value of the contract was not immediately available.  
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe originally asked for a three-year contract worth $4  
million annually, but he has since lowered his number. The team had 
not improved from its offer of $3.15 million -- going backwards, in 
fact, to $3 million -- but did offer Dafoe a second chance at 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're glad that what turned out to be a bit of an ordeal for  
all of us is over,'' Sinden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Amen to that,'' Dafoe said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We both extended ourselves more than we initially felt we  
would,'' he said. ``We're both happy. I can honestly say that I'm 
happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dafoe was second in save percentage and third with a 1.99 goals  
against average last season while leading the league with 10 
shutouts. With him in goal, the Bruins were expected to improve on 
last year's second-round playoff exit and perhaps even make it to 
the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dafoe passed up a chance to take the team to arbitration  
this summer, choosing instead to use the leverage of a holdout. And 
Sinden didn't budge, sticking with his initial offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harry's notorious for these negotiations,'' Dafoe said. ``We  
all know that he's a shrewd businessman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Things seemed to go Dafoe's way when backups Rob Tallas and John  
Grahame couldn't stop the Bruins from opening the season without a 
victory in their first nine games (0-5-4) -- their worst start since 
1964-65. The team was also missing its top goal-scorer from last 
year, Dmitri Khristich, who was set free after winning a $2.8 
million arbitration award. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very hard for me to watch, win or lose. But they've  
definitely turned the corner these last four or five games,'' Dafoe 
said. ``Holding out is a very lonely place to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Boston has won their last three games, including Thursday  
night's 7-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning, to improve to 
3-5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinden said he did not allow the team's early troubles or its  
recent success to influence the negotiations. But he said that 
coach Pat Burns was ``very happy he's got his No. 1 goalie back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying to keep patient, and hopefully time would resolve  
it,'' Sinden said. ``I hadn't reached the point where I had thrown 
up my hands.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Brown Suspended 4 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos defensive end Cyron Brown was  
suspended by the NFL on Friday for the next four regular season 
games for violating the league's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who joined the Broncos as a rookie free agent last year,  
will be eligible to return to the active roster on Nov. 23, the day 
after the game against the Oakland Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
	Broncos spokesman Jim Saccomano said he did not know what Brown  
did to violate the policy. Brown is the first Bronco to violate the 
policy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL spokesman Greg Aiello would not comment on why Brown was  
suspended. The information is confidential under the players' union 
contract, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL players are required to undergo random drug testing and a  
suspension usually means a player has failed three drug tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Some players have been suspended after two failed drug tests if  
they had substance abuse problems before joining the league. 
</P>
<P>
	A fourth violation of the policy results in a ban of at least  
one year.

<HEADLINE> Writers Bring Back Serial Format </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As publishers wonder what will sell in the 21st  
century, some popular writers are reviving a sensation from the 
1800s: the serialized novel. 
</P>
<P>
	Caleb Carr, author of the historical thriller ``The Alienist,''  
is serializing a futuristic novella in Time magazine. John 
Grisham's new novel will come out next year in installments in The 
Oxford American, a Mississippi-based journal he helps publish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was shocked, and very pleasantly shocked, when Time asked me  
to do it. It's a great tradition that's been lost,'' Carr said 
Thursday. His work will appear in five special editions of Time, 
all centered on the future. The first part is planned for Monday's 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``All writers, after writing a number of books in a certain  
genre, think about doing something different just to see if you can 
do it,'' added Grisham, who plans to write a coming-of-age story, 
with no lawyers or courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Serials are a part of both publishing and cultural history. In  
the 1830s, when new technology allowed for rapid mass distribution 
of printed materials, a magazine publisher convinced a young 
Charles Dickens to write a book in monthly installments. ``The 
Pickwick Papers'' was an unprecedented success, with readers 
following the progress of his novel the way soap opera viewers now 
await the next day's episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the greatest literature has first been serialized,  
including Tolstoy's ``War and Peace,'' Dostoevsky's ``Crime and 
Punishment'' and Henry James' ``The Portrait of a Lady.'' Mark 
Twain and Herman Melville are among the many other writers whose 
novels originally appeared in magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is what people wanted to read,'' said Lewis Lapham,  
editor of Harper's magazine, which serialized Dickens, Anthony 
Trollope, Thomas Hardy and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dickens was a rock star, comparable to Mick Jagger. Enormous  
crowds came out to see him speak. Tolstoy and Dostoevsky would 
publish their fiction in magazines and crowds would surround the 
kiosks to read it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks in part to the rise of the short story, and to the rise  
of movies and other media, the format faded. But it never really 
disappeared. Norman Mailer's ``An American Dream'' was issued in 
installments by Esquire in the 1960s and Tom Wolfe's ``The Bonfire 
of the Vanities'' first came out in Rolling Stone in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Ideally, serials help both periodicals and publishers. The  
Oxford American, which has an average print run of 50,000 copies, 
plans to quadruple that number for the six issues next year 
featuring Grisham's novel. ``Bonfire of the Vanities'' received 
enormous advance publicity through its appearance in Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tremendously successful both for Rolling Stone and for  
Wolfe,'' said Laurie Brown, vice president of marketing for Wolfe's 
publisher, Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux. ``There's a long wait between 
his novels and it gave audiences something to sustain their 
appetite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the '90s, a new kind of serial emerged: a continuing story  
published entirely in book form. Stephen King's ``The Green Mile'' 
consisted of six short novels, each released a month apart. Romance 
writer Jackie Collins and horror writer John Saul both used a 
similar approach. 
</P>
<P>
	But with magazines giving far less space to fiction than they  
did a century ago, old-fashioned serializing has become 
increasingly rare. Both Lapham and Brown doubt whether even writers 
with the appeal of Grisham and Carr can fully bring it back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nostalgia thing, a stunt,'' Lapham said. ``Look at  
Grisham: They call his books page-turners because they're something 
you want to get through in one evening. You don't want to wait four 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a novelty value,'' Brown said, ``and it makes for an  
intriguing press release, but it's a gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I wonder about subscribers. Magazines have a much more hit  
or miss readership than they used to. Even if people get a magazine 
regularly, they don't always finish them. It's more like a cable TV 
show, where people try to catch two or three episodes but they 
can't get all 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for Grisham, he said the response to his serial novel will  
determine if he drops the legal element from future works. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's well-received and people enjoy it, I can think of  
other stories that might come from the past,'' Grisham said. ``If 
it's not, I just might go back and kill some more lawyers. That 
seems to be working real well.''

<HEADLINE> Investigators Visit No Gun Ri Scene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- U.S. investigators visited the scene  
today of an alleged mass killing of South Korean civilians by 
American soldiers in the early days of the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight U.S. investigators, led by the Army's inspector  
general, Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, interviewed survivors of the 
alleged killing. Their visit marked the first field investigation 
of the event in July 1950 at No Gun Ri, a hamlet in central South 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Ackerman promised a thorough and transparent  
investigation,'' said Chung Eun-yong, representative of the 
victims' families. ``Otherwise, they didn't say much. They just 
listened to what we have to say for about one hour, and they looked 
sincere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Sept. 30, The Associated Press reported accounts by American  
veterans and South Korean villagers that U.S. soldiers killed up to 
400 civilians at No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	Before publication of the AP accounts, both U.S. and South  
Korean officials had told South Koreans seeking acknowledgment of 
the killings and compensation that they had found no evidence of a 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Todsay, the U.S. officials flew by helicopter to the hamlet  
after meeting South Korean Defense Ministry officials in Seoul to 
discuss coordinating the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	At No Gun Ri, the U.S. officials first visited twin railroad  
underpasses where the alleged killings took place. Then they moved 
to a nearby government building to interview five survivors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the talks in Seoul, U.S. and South Korean investigators  
agreed to ``closely cooperate and thoroughly uncover all the 
facts,'' Seoul's Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooperation will include exchange of historical data and lists  
of questions for interviewing South Korean survivors and U.S. 
veterans, the ministry said. During the 1 1/2-hour meeting, they 
agreed to try to finish their investigations by mid-2000, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighty people waving signs rallied outside the government  
building where U.S. investigators met No Gun Ri victims. 
</P>
<P>
	They demanded Washington also investigate their claim that U.S.  
troops killed at least 80 people taking shelter in a Confucian 
shrine in the southeastern coastal city of Masan in August 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	The Masan case is one of several accounts of refugee killings at  
U.S. hands that have surfaced since AP's No Gun RI story appeared. 
Both U.S. and South Korean officials have indicated they will look 
into those cases, but will concentrate first on No Gun Ri. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. investigators were to return to Washington on Saturday.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesian Cabinet Sworn in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- As his new Cabinet was sworn in,  
Indonesia's president told government ministers today he would not 
tolerate corruption among them, and he faced his first security 
scare from irate protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	As the new ministers gathered for their official group photo in  
front of the presidential palace today, hundreds of people gathered 
in a park across the street shouting: ``What will happen to our 
jobs?'' The protesters were members of the Information Ministry and 
Social Affairs Ministry, both of which were eliminated when the new 
Cabinet was announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Abdurrahman Wahid, who has suffered two strokes in  
recent years and is nearly blind, headed out of the palace with his 
wife in a golf cart to talk with the protesters, but the crowd 
suddenly surged forward, forcing the head of state to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demonstrations are nothing new for me,'' Wahid said. ``I  
wanted to go to speak to them. But my security men said it was 
unsafe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid took office last week amid hopes he can continue  
Indonesia's transition to democracy after more than 30 years of 
autocratic rule capped by two years of political instability, 
economic crisis and civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	In a nationally televised address, Wahid said his 35-member  
``national unity'' Cabinet would serve until 2004. However, he 
added that any minister suspected of taking bribes would be 
expected to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid has promised his team will be free of the graft that was  
rampant under authoritarian President Suharto and his successor, 
B.J. Habibie, who was ousted last week. He indicated that his 
attorney general would be on the lookout for corruption and would 
prosecute any officials involved in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope all of you can live simply, fairly and honestly and be  
able to perform your duties as expected by the people,'' Wahid said 
in his speech today at the ornate Merdeka palace. ``If any among 
you are brought to court by the attorney general, then it is better 
for you to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri read the oath of office to  
the new ministers. 
</P>
<P>
	In the oath, each minister pledged ``not to receive any gifts  
from anybody who I know, or think, will have a hidden interest 
related to my duty and position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid warned his new ministers that they face the ``tough job''  
of maintaining national unity and fixing the economy, which was 
hard-hit by Asia's financial meltdown. He said it also should push 
for greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Cabinet is the product of history and carries the hopes  
of the Indonesian people to change our lives,'' Wahid said. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, financial markets and foreign governments have  
responded well to the Cabinet lineup. It includes representatives 
of all major political parties, religions, ethnic groups and 
islands across Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had hoped Wahid would reduce the powerful military's  
influence in the government. Wahid did so, appointing the first 
civilian defense minister since the 1950s and including the fewest 
military men since 1965, when the armed forces took over control of 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The new minister of mines and energy, former general Susilo  
Bambang Yudhoyono, said the military would have to relinquish its 
dominant political role. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military has to revise its doctrine and mission, moving  
away from day-to-day politics and concentrating on reforms and 
security,'' said Yudhoyono, whom analysts have described as one of 
the army's top reformists.

<HEADLINE> Computer Woes Hurt Hershey Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HERSHEY, Pa. (AP) -- Problems involving a new computer system  
have disrupted distribution of Hershey's chocolates, so some little 
ghosts and goblins will be disappointed -- or snacking on rival Mars 
bars -- come Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
	And Santa might be next in line to be affected.  
</P>
<P>
	Hershey Foods Corp., the nation's largest candymaker, announced  
a 16 percent drop in third-quarter earnings per share earlier this 
week. Hershey Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth L. Wolfe 
acknowledged that the company's distribution woes have led to lost 
sales and increased costs. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company had hoped to get customer service back to  
normal by the end of the month but that the goal would not be met. 
He said the company still expects to improve through the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave few details, but The Wall Street Journal reported today  
that spot shortages of Hershey's products have prompted many stores 
to replace their usual supplies of the company's candies with other 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales have increased for rivals like Mars Inc. and Nestle USA  
without any special promotions to boost sales, the newspaper said. 
And some customers and industry analysts said they believe the 
problems could persist at least through Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Callers to a Hershey's consumer phone line today were told the  
company is ``doing everything possible to correct these temporary 
difficulties. We apologize for the inconvenience and appreciate 
your patience. You should be able to locate your favorite products 
in your stores soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey said it lost about one-tenth of a percentage point of  
its still-dominant market share in the four weeks ended Sept. 12, 
and retailers forecast a sharper drop for October, the Journal 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hershey spokesman John Long had no comment on the article, other  
than to refer to the earnings announcement, issued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The company planned to bring its new, $112 million computer  
system online during a slow period in April but was forced to delay 
until July when development and testing were not completed, the 
newspaper reported. That's the month that retailers begin ordering 
for Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
	In discussing the problem last month, the company said earnings  
for the entire fiscal year could be 8 percent to 10 percent below 
previous projections. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a candy company to miss part of Halloween is not as bad as  
a toy company missing part of Christmas, but it's close,'' John M. 
McMillin, who follows the food industry for Prudential Securities, 
said at the time.

<HEADLINE> Clarke: Forget Lindros Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia Flyers steadied themselves  
after an 0-5-1 start that put some early tarnish on their Stanley 
Cup hopes. They're back in contention for first place. Things 
should be fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from it.  
</P>
<P>
	Eric Lindros is out with a persistent, mysterious illness. Coach  
Roger Neilson survived rumors about his job, but can't shake a 
virus he's had for a month. General manager Bob Clarke looks ready 
to pounce as he stands ominously in the executive box during games. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite body language to the contrary, Clarke said Friday he's  
not going to panic -- and that means forget about trading No. 88. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trading Lindros,'' Clarke said in his New Jersey  
office, one day after the Flyers, playing without Lindros, blew a 
4-0 lead in the third period before coming back to beat Colorado 
5-4 in overtime. ``We're not trading anybody. Teams ask about a lot 
of players, but it doesn't mean you're trading them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also doesn't mean that players are immune to the rumblings,  
especially Lindros. He and his father, Carl Lindros, who is also 
his agent, make no secret of their belief that the Flyers have 
entertained trade offers for one of the most dynamic players in the 
game. Before the season, Lindros lamented having been ``shopped 
around the league'' in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Lindros and longtime linemate John LeClair are signed  
only through this season, there is no indication Clarke has 
anything in the works. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers have more pressing concerns.  
</P>
<P>
	With forwards Rod Brind'Amour and Keith Jones sidelined with  
injuries, the Flyers started 0-5-1, the worst start in their 
32-year history. They promptly won four straight, quieting the 
alarm, but glaring weaknesses resurfaced in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, trying to play despite his illness, had one of the  
worst games of his career Tuesday night in a 5-2 loss to Vancouver 
in which the Canucks overwhelmed Philadelphia with speed. Lindros 
and LeClair were on the ice for four Vancouver goals, and each made 
a glaring turnover that led to a score. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros has four goals in 11 games and is minus-5. LeClair  
played better Thursday night, but has four goals in 12 games and is 
minus-7. 
</P>
<P>
	With Lindros home in bed Thursday night, the Flyers blew a 4-0  
lead against the Avalanche by allowing four goals on eight shots in 
8:09. Valeri Zelepukin saved them with a goal that was supposed to 
be a pass with 8.2 seconds left in OT. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got good people in this locker room who stick  
together,'' said Mark Recchi, the Flyers' best player thus far with 
a team-high five goals and 18 points. ``That's why we got through 
that 0-5-1. The concern was very minimal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke was a conspicuous presence throughout the game, standing  
and pacing around his box high above the ice. He said nothing 
should be gleaned from that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sit lots of times,'' Clarke said. ``Just however I feel that  
night, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros, whose season was cut short last year by a scary,  
draining bout with a collapsed lung, has been sick for more than a 
week. Doctors are calling it a virus, and Clarke shot down 
speculation that Lindros was anemic. He's questionable for 
Saturday's home game against New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors tell us that he is not anemic,'' Clarke said. ``He  
has a virus and is very run down, which is what a virus does to 
anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson, who has been sick for a month, is considering Clarke's  
offer to take a couple of days off during the team's upcoming road 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke suggested that Neilson, whose girlfriend lives in Dallas,  
should fly there Sunday and rest before rejoining the team 
Wednesday in Anaheim. Assistants Wayne Cashman and Craig Ramsay, 
both with head coaching experience, would run practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Neilson is wary, because only two weeks ago he was being  
bombarded with questions about his job security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly considering it,'' Neilson said. ``I'll wait and  
see how I feel. I'm always a little skeptical of being sent away, 
so I probably won't go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke, practicing the patience he's preaching, made only a  
minor change Friday. Rookie defenseman Mark Eaton will be sent to 
the minors and defenseman Andy Delmore will join the team for the 
four-game road trip that begins next week. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides standing, pacing and hoping, that's all from upstairs --  
for now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't replace Lindros. We can't replace Brind'Armour,''  
Clarke said. ``You hope other people step up. That's all you can 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Internet Acquisitions Bolster Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Who wants to bet on a loser?  
</P>
<P>
	Seems just about everyone does nowadays, if there's a  
``dot-com'' behind the name. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the top Internet companies are spending hundreds of  
millions of dollars buying money-losing competitors in the hope 
that building audiences and revenue will help them ride to the top 
of the Web tidal wave. Others are spending to add new `Hey, look at 
me!' features on their redesigned Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's trying to get their act together and get this stuff  
out in time for the Christmas shopping season,'' said media 
e-commerce analyst Malcolm Maclachlan at International Data Corp. 
``The problem with everyone doing it this late, though, is that 
you're really going to have to train consumer behavior to know 
there have been changes, and it's really too late to do that for 
this year, so it's really like a prelude to next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past week alone, CMGI Inc.'s AltaVista unit, Excite At  
Home and Lycos Inc. stepped in with new announcements about their 
portal sites, which operate as gatekeepers to a variety of Web 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft Corp. this coming week is expected to unveil its  
redesigned MSN.com portal, which aims to offer users improved and 
easier access to its sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The company gave consumers a hint of its changes this past week  
by announcing a deal with Nortel Networks to offer call-waiting and 
caller ID, beginning in Seattle, San Diego and Atlanta, to those 
users who don't want to get a second phone line but want the 
ability to disconnect from the Internet and take the call. 
</P>
<P>
	AltaVista's redone portal was unveiled with the power of a $120  
million marketing campaign behind it. But the Palo Alto-based 
company immediately ran into trouble with some longtime users, who 
griped that the revamped search engine dropped some Web pages and 
made finding relevant matches to queries more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the overall revamp received all-important kudos from Wall  
Street analysts, and its new offer of free Internet access is 
expected to help build its user base more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite At Home, meantime, agreed to acquire Blue Mountain Arts  
for $780 million in stock and cash. Never mind that Blue Mountain 
has yet to make a dime; it's the most popular site for electronic 
greeting cards and could drive new users to Excite. The acquisition 
helps Redwood City-based Excite top Disney's Go Network to become 
the No. 5 site for Internet traffic, according to research firm 
Media Metrix. 
</P>
<P>
	Lycos, hoping not to be outdone, released its revamped shopping  
service that adds a loyalty rewards program and shopping comparison 
tools -- a feature rapidly becoming a consumer must-have -- as well 
as user product reviews. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say there's a method behind the spending madness.  
</P>
<P>
	These portals are hungrily eyeing the cash that Yahoo! Inc. and  
America Online Inc. are raking in (few of the portals have turned a 
profit), and are looking to stand out to advertisers, marketers and 
investors funneling their cash to the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yahoo! and AOL are so dominant in this space, that the very  
crowded mid-tier portals are looking to break out,'' noted 
new-media analyst Charlene Li at Forrester Research. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the leaders aren't standing still. Yahoo! announced  
recently that it was adding a voice feature to its chat rooms to 
allow users to talk to each other, while AOL announced a 
partnership to have its Internet software pre-loaded on Gateway 
Computers. 
</P>
<P>
	While many Internet companies are losing money today in the  
hopes of becoming eventual winners, consumers already have gained, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, a consumer can buy a computer -- either for free or very  
cheap -- log onto the Internet for free, find an item fairly quickly 
and sometime buy without paying tax or shipping. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they're duking it out in the ever-shrinking space,  
the consumer is likely to profit,'' Li said.

<HEADLINE> Gap Stores President Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Robert Fisher, the son of the founders of the  
Gap clothing chain, has resigned from his post as president of the 
slumping Gap stores division. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher, who has been with the Gap since 1980s when he started as  
a store manager, will also step down from his position as executive 
vice president of the parent company, Gap Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation, announced Thursday, is effective Nov. 15. After  
that, the Gap stores division will report to Millard Drexler, 
president and chief executive of Gap Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said in a statement that Fisher was leaving for  
personal reasons, but there was some speculation over whether the 
sagging sales at the Gap stores led to his departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors cheered the move, pushing up the stock $3.12 1/2, or  
nearly 10 percent, to $34.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The namesake Gap stores were long the anchor and big money maker  
of the San Francisco-based Gap Inc. chain. But the division's sales 
started to slide last spring as customers shied away from some of 
its fashions and many turned to its sister division -- Old Navy -- 
where they could find trendy, casual clothing at cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the Gap now needs is fresh thinking,'' said Kurt Barnard,  
a retail consultant and president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report 
in Upper Montclair, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to put the same energy into the Gap as they did with  
Old Navy when they created it a few years ago,'' he added. ``The 
Gap needs to stand out again as it once did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fisher is the son of Donald and Doris Fisher, who opened a small  
store in 1969 in San Francisco. The couple named their store The 
Gap -- after ``the generation gap'' -- and concentrated on selling 
Levi's jeans. 
</P>
<P>
	The chain now has about 2,500 stores, which also includes Gap,  
Old Navy, Banana Republic, GapKids and babyGap stores. 
</P>

	Fisher, who is 44, joined the company in 1980 after received an  
MBA at Stanford University. Five years later, he was named 
executive vice president of merchandising for Banana Republic, then 
an 11-store division of Gap Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	He became Banana Republic's president in 1989 and was elected to  
Gap Inc.'s board of directors in 1990. An executive vice president 
of the company since 1992, he served as chief operating officer 
from 1992-93 and 1995-97, and chief financial officer from 1993-95. 
</P>
<P>
	He was named head of the Gap division in 1997, charged with  
reversing the division's sales decline. The turnaround was almost 
immediate -- sales were strong in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his direction, the company refocused the direction of the  
Gap stores, directing more attention to basics -- such as jeans, 
T-shirts and khakis. Gap also opened its online store.

<HEADLINE> Sweepstakes Co. Files Chapter 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- American Family Enterprises, which runs a  
sweepstakes plugged by Dick Clark and Ed McMahon, filed for 
bankruptcy protection Friday to help settle dozens of lawsuits 
alleging deceptive advertising over its sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	American Family also announced that it had reached an agreement  
in principle that it expects will settle several dozen class-action 
lawsuits that have been consolidated in federal court here. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're hoping in the next week we'll be able to announce a  
settlement,'' said a company spokesman, Rich Tauberman. He said 
terms remain confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	American Family said the bankruptcy would not disrupt separate  
agreements, entered over the last year, that paid a total of $6.9 
million to 40 states and the District of Columbia to resolve 
similar allegations on sweepstakes advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jersey City company said the Chapter 11 reorganization would  
not affect its sweepstakes or magazine subscription operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's next drawings, for $1 million on Nov. 24 and for  
$10 million on Jan. 31, are still scheduled, all entries are valid 
and all prizes will be awarded, said Susan Caughman, president and 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	She said all of the money for its contests ``have been  
pre-funded and are held in trust by federally insured independent 
financial institutions until the award date.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No prize winners have been affected. People can still buy  
magazines. There is no impact for consumers,'' Tauberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately held company said it filed for bankruptcy ``to  
resolve its pending litigation, strategically restructure its 
finances and operations, and to enable it to compete successfully 
over the long term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Figures on assets and liabilities, and its largest creditors,  
were not available, Tauberman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it had obtained funding to assist it  
through restructuring, but Tauberman would not say how much. 
</P>
<P>
	American Family is sponsor of the American Family Publishers  
sweepstakes, whose past mailings have been criticized for giving 
people the impression they had won or needed to buy a subscription 
to enter. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate, reacting to reports of people who spent  
thousands of dollars to buy magazines in attempts to win, or who 
traveled to pick up prizes they mistakenly believed they had won, 
voted 93-0 in August to put new restrictions on the sweepstakes 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has not yet acted on similar legislation.  
</P>
<P>
	Another major sweepstakes operator, Publishers Clearing House,  
has been sued by nine states over its advertising.

<HEADLINE> L.A. Times Makes Editorial Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Times won't make business  
deals if they involve editorial content, the publisher promised in 
apologizing to employees for sharing profits with a sports arena on 
a recent issue of the Los Angeles Times Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn M. Downing said she would look for possible conflicts in  
all existing contracts while establishing written guidelines 
designed to ensure the newspaper's integrity. 
</P>
<P>
	Downing made her pledge Thursday while apologizing to hundreds  
of angry reporters and editors who said they feared the newspaper's 
reputation had been damaged by the deal with the Staples Center. 
The entire Oct. 10 edition of the magazine was about the new arena, 
which is owned by businessman Philip Anschutz, developer Edward 
Roski Jr. and News Corp.'s Fox Group. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, she said her own misunderstanding of editorial  
principles led to the deal, which she failed to disclose to readers 
and the newspaper's staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major, major mistake, but I am the publisher of the  
L.A. Times and I am staying the publisher of the L.A. Times,'' she 
said. ``The question is how do I come up the learning curve 
faster?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before becoming publisher last June, Downing was president and  
chief executive officer of Mosby-Matthew Bender, a legal publishing 
company formerly owned by the Times' parent, Times Mirror Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark H. Willes, Times Mirror chairman and chief executive, said  
he has ``total confidence'' in Downing, despite her lack of 
background in journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having had this experience, she will work doubly hard to make  
sure not only that it gets addressed appropriately but that it 
doesn't happen again,'' Willes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times has an advertising deal with the $375 million Staples  
Center arena, the new home of basketball's Los Angeles Lakers and 
Clippers and hockey's Los Angeles Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper is one of 10 founding partners. Each pays $2.75  
million to $3 million a year for a luxury suite and exclusive 
rights to post advertising inside the arena and on the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal includes a provision that calls on the newspaper and  
arena to ``work together on joint opportunities for additional 
revenue.'' Times business managers viewed the special issue as one 
of those opportunities, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Times Editor Michael Parks said decisions about editorial  
content were made solely by the editorial department.

<HEADLINE> After-Hours Trading To Make Debut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Investing-crazed Americans and their brokers were  
expected to keep to the sidelines as the Chicago Stock Exchange 
leads the way toward an expanded trading day. 
</P>
<P>
	After-hours trading takes the floor today, making its first  
appearance at a traditional stock exchange as financial markets 
edge toward a seemingly inevitable future of round-the-clock 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	But most investors were expected to take a wait-and-see  
approach. Experts, after all, are warning that they are more 
vulnerable after hours in a more volatile, less liquid market. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not something for everybody, at least in the foreseeable  
future,'' acknowledged Bob Forney, chief executive of the Chicago 
exchange, America's third largest behind New York and Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of trading in the two-hour extra sessions -- 4:30 p.m.  
to 6:30 p.m. Eastern time -- is expected to be ``very small'' for 
the first few weeks and months. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the move by the Chicago exchange is seen as a momentous --  
if early -- step toward all-day trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the beginning of a long evolution where  
eventually you're going to have 24-hour trading in virtually any 
stock worldwide,'' said John Markese, president of the American 
Association of Individual Investors. 
</P>
<P>
	After decades of being locked into traditional hours -- last  
expanded in 1985 to 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time -- the trading 
world has been shaken up by off-hours trading offered to 
individuals by upstart electronic exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Several regional stock exchanges, including Chicago, offer a few  
minutes of late trading for institutional investors, such as 
pension funds. But individuals who want the protection offered by 
traditional exchanges had been left out. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching the Chicago exchange's experience closely will be its  
bigger, better-known New York competitors. The New York Stock 
Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market tentatively plan to open their own 
after-hours sessions next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to knock anyone's socks off'' today, said  
Andrew Davis, vice chairman of the downtown Chicago exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe we're a little bit early,'' he said. ``But it beats the  
hell out of being late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exchange officials anticipate only a handful of trades today and  
an estimated 1,000 to 2,000 daily by mid-2000. After-hours trading 
won't really take off, they expect, for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	While some 120 brokerages and dealers have the capability to  
place customers' orders with the exchange, many are sitting out for 
now, reluctant to commit extra staff and time without customer 
demand to justify the expense. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 311 most-active stocks from the NYSE, Nasdaq and the  
American Stock Exchange will be traded initially in Chicago, where 
more than 90 percent of all transactions are handled 
electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	To protect investors from wide price swings that might take  
place when only a small number of people are trading, investors 
will be allowed to buy and sell only through ``limit orders.'' This 
means customers must state maximum and minimum prices at which they 
are willing to buy or sell. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, there are concerns about greater risks associated with  
after-hours trading until the number of players grows. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not for me,'' said Ted Lauder, 44, a Chicago insurance  
agent. ``Like a lot of other people, I got sucked into playing 
around with a few thousand dollars in after-hours trading. I got 
burned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Markese sees no reason for individual investors to indulge yet  
in after-hours trading, which he calls ``a different market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are more vulnerable after hours, he said, because with  
low volume and a marketplace scattered among disconnected 
electronic trading systems, it may be difficult to find the best 
price. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we get the world hooked up and communicating, it'll be a  
much broader market,'' the Chicago-based investment expert said. 
``Right now, we're not there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The after-hours debut nevertheless is a coup for Chicago, which  
despite processing 65 million to 70 million shares a day is still 
trying to shake its label as a regional exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Regional exchanges -- Chicago, Philadelphia, Boston, Cincinnati  
and the Pacific with dual operations in Los Angeles and San 
Francisco -- started out trading in local or regional stocks but 
increasingly offer national and international issues.

<HEADLINE> McCain: Campaign Reform a 'Gateway' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WALPOLE, N.H. (AP) -- With a subtle change in rhetoric,  
presidential candidate John McCain is scoring points with 
Republican voters by linking his pet project -- campaign finance 
reform -- to issues voters care more about. 
</P>
<P>
	Better schools, lower taxes, expanded health care and smaller  
government would result if big-money special interests were weeded 
out of politics, McCain argues in a new formulation of the oldest 
plank in his presidential platform. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the gateway reform,'' he said in an interview Friday  
aboard his campaign bus. ``If you really want to lower taxes ... 
you've got to get rid of the special interests. If you really want 
a better education system, you've got to break the teachers' 
unions. If you want a (strong) military, you've got to break the 
backs of contractors'' who rack up Pentagon spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona senator lags far behind front-runner George W. Bush  
of Texas in national polls, but has quickly narrowed the gap in New 
Hampshire. Those same surveys consistently rank campaign finance 
reform far down the list of voter concerns -- yet the issue comes up 
repeatedly when McCain plays host to town halls in this initial 
primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	``What would you do to curb the influence of money in  
politics?'' a woman asked at the first of two town hall meetings 
Friday. ``Everybody knows Washington is for sale; what can you do 
to start changing this?'' asked Ted Leach, in Peterborough for the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator didn't get into the specifics of his failed efforts  
to eliminate unregulated donations to political parties and 
restrict the thinly veiled attacks ads that result from those 
so-called ``soft money'' donations. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he broadly denounced the political system with words  
designed to strike a chord with voters in this live-free-or-die 
state. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an incumbency protection racket that keeps incumbents  
in office. Until I draw my last breath, I will fight for this 
issue,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long ago, he glazed over eyes of voters by talking about  
campaign finance reform in legislative terms -- amendments, 
conference committees, soft money and hard money. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he weaves the topic into the fabric of every campaign event,  
calling for the dimming of special interest influence in terms 
people understand. And he is using issues that pollsters say 
resonate with voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Improve health care? Don't let lobbyists for trial lawyers and  
insurance companies block HMO reform, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Improve national security? Stop caving to contractors who slip  
projects into bills that aren't needed, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Improve schools? Create charter schools and test public-school  
vouchers over the objections of unions, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Cut taxes? Get special interest groups out of the business of  
writing their tax breaks into law, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I evolved,'' McCain says of the new stump style. ``I  
think over time I've been able to clean up the rhetoric ... of 
campaign finance reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, McCain's pollsters found that campaign finance  
reform ranked near the bottom when voters were asked to score 
issues in order of importance. Public polls get similar results. 
</P>
<P>
	But the issue rose to the top three -- after Social Security and  
education -- when McCain's pollsters put it into context with loaded 
questions. An example: ``If told that Republicans are in the grips 
of HMO companies and Democrats are controlled by trial lawyers, do 
you think campaign finance reform is needed to pass a Patients Bill 
of Rights?'' 
</P>
<P>
	In those terms, McCain thinks he has a winning issue.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is a stronger emphasis to connect the dots between  
campaign finance reform and movement on other issue fronts,'' said 
McCain adviser John Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got guts taking on the political system,'' said William  
Nichols, who attended the Walpole town hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like the fact that he keeps coming back to the issue. It's  
not just one point in his speech. It's a part of everything he 
talks about. Education, the environment -- he talks about a mining 
company contributing money and then polluting. He understands this. 
He's probably seen it,'' said Leach, the town hall questioner who 
decided to support McCain after Thursday's night's GOP debate in 
Hanover. 
</P>
<P>
	While the issue may be touching a nerve in town halls, McCain  
still must overcome the objection of conservative interest group 
leaders who fear that campaign finance reform will diminish their 
political influence. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain argues that rank-and-file Republicans will respond to  
reforms that he says will lead to lower taxes and smaller 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a conservative issue,'' McCain said. ``This is a good  
issue.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Commuter Prevents Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- A jolt of morning coffee before work  
might have proved anticlimactic for commuter Jonathan McBride. 
</P>
<P>
	En route to work, he saved his own life and those of two others  
by grabbing the wheel of an out-of-control carpool vehicle in which 
he was riding Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver of a sport utility vehicle had picked up McBride and  
a female passenger earlier from a so-called ``slug'' line. Sharing 
rides with strangers is common in congested northern Virginia -- 
allowing lone drivers to use carpool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
	Five minutes into the trip, McBride looked up from his newspaper  
to see the vehicle headed for a concrete barrier at 65 mph. The 
driver was unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
	McBride grabbed the wheel, careened across two lanes and  
narrowly missed a wall on the left side of the highway. Though he 
was able to steer the vehicle under control, the driver's foot was 
pressing the accelerator to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	As the vehicle sped up Interstate 395, McBride yanked the  
automatic gear shift. The truck lurched into reverse, then bounced 
into neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	As McBride searched for a place to pull over, and the driver  
suddenly awoke. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where am I?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	McBride said the groggy man shook himself, put the car back in  
gear and resumed driving. He apologized and mentioned long work 
hours, medication and a dizzy feeling shortly after picking up the 
commuters. 
</P>
<P>
	The trip ended when the driver let out both riders in Washington  
and headed off. The woman hugged McBride and, without exchanging 
names or numbers, they went to work.

<HEADLINE> Ariz. Retirees Cheer Forbes Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUN CITY, Ariz. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Steve  
Forbes tried to sell his Social Security and flat tax proposals to 
Arizona retirees on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the real issues,'' the millionaire publisher told  
about 650 people who donned Forbes hats and stickers. ``If we do it 
right, we can have a glorious result.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, who won the state's Republican primary in 1996, said he  
believes Social Security reform is one of the main issues on 
people's minds, and that the system needs to be changed to 
eliminate waste. 
</P>
<P>
	He proposed that it be converted into a system of individual  
retirement accounts and said taxes on Social Security benefits 
should be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	Fresh from a town hall meeting with his GOP rivals Thursday  
night in New Hampshire, Forbes said he was proud that his flat tax 
idea was catching on. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona Sen. John McCain said in the debate that he supported  
the flat tax so Americans could fill out their returns on a 
postcard ``and not have the fear of an audit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said his idea of reforming the tax code would be to  
provide exemptions of $13,000 for each adult and $5,000 for each 
child. 
</P>
<P>
	That would give a family of four a total tax exemption of  
$36,000. If they earned $40,000 in one year, they would pay taxes 
on just $4,000 at a rate of 17 percent, Forbes said, adding that 
many taxpayers would save money. 
</P>
<P>
	He also proposed ending inheritance taxes and those on pensions  
and capital gains.

	Plot Closes Cleveland High School

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- An apparent plot by students to stage ``violent  
acts'' at a Cleveland high school have forced authorities to close 
the school today. According to a published report today, several 
South High School students admitted planning an attack with guns 
and explosives, similar to the one carried out by two students at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., last April. A South High 
student learned of the plot Wednesday morning and alerted her 
parents. One of the parents notified the school, The Plain Dealer 
reported today. The school has 1,500 students.

<P>
	COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Richard C. Johnson was scheduled to die  
today for killing a state trooper, but his execution has been put 
on hold following a confession from a Nebraska woman. Johnson faced 
lethal injection for the 1985 shooting death of Bruce K. Smalls. 
Johnson also was convicted of killing a Virginia man who had given 
him a ride. But the South Carolina Supreme Court yesterday stayed 
the execution in response to statements from Connie Hess, a fellow 
traveler of Johnson's whose testimony was used to convict him. In a 
sworn affidavit, Hess said it was she, not Johnson, who killed the 
trooper. She also said a third hitchhiker killed the Virginia man.

request by the visitors to see the deposed prime minister. There 
was no immediate comment from representatives of the Commonwealth, 
which groups Britain and its former colonies. Civilian members of 
the new military regime have told Commonwealth delegation members 
that their setup is not martial law because civil rights, press 
freedoms and the judiciary remain intact. The Commonwealth has

four years. Tens of thousands are expected to jam lower Broadway 
for the parade, which will start at noon EDT. 3,500 police officers 
have been assigned to the parade.

	Police: Ohio H.S. Plot Is Foiled  
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Four white students were arrested and seven  
others questioned today in what was described as a racially 
motivated plot to carry out a Columbine-style massacre at their 
predominantly black high school. Mayor Michael R. White closed 
South High for the day after the parents of a student tipped off 
authorities. White said that police seized two guns from one 
student's house, and that the group also planned to get weapons 
from a gang. No guns or explosives were found at the school.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Aiming to protect American families from  
abuses of private material, President Clinton proposed regulation 
today to secure electronic medical records from employers and 
marketing companies. Clinton's proposal would apply to all 
electronic medical records and to all health plans. He said the 
technology has been wrongfully exploited by employers and marketing 
firms with a scrutiny like that of Big Brother in George Orwell's 
futuristic novel ``1984.''

	Stewart Plane Crashed at 600 mph  
</P>
<P>
	ABERDEEN, S.D. (AP) -- Payne Stewart's Learjet was going about  
600 mph when it struck the ground, the chief government 
investigator said today. Bob Benzon of the National Transportation 
Safety Board based the speed estimate on the condition of the 
cockpit voice recorder taken from the wreckage. In fact, the voice 
recorder was in such bad shape that the NTSB decided to send it to 
Seattle so its manufacturer could help with the readout. The unit 
uses electronics to store information, rather than a magnetic tape 
of the sort used in a tape recorder.

	BEIJING (AP) -- Stung by five days of defiant displays by a  
banned spiritual movement, China's communist government displayed 
rougher tactics Friday in its campaign to stamp out the Falun Gong, 
hauling away at least 50 followers. As police rounded up Falun Gong 
members, a few college-age followers abandoned four days of quiet 
vigils and daringly unveiled a petition in Tiananmen Square asking 
Chinese leaders for tolerance.

	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The chief Israeli and Palestinian negotiators  
finally met for the first time Friday and set Nov. 7 as the 
starting date for talks on a permanent peace treaty. The two-hour 
meeting between Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo 
and Israeli diplomat Oded Eran came three days ahead of a Mideast

mourning for its prime minister and seven other officials killed by 
nationalist gunmen. Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian, parliament 
speaker Karen Demirchian and six others were killed Wednesday by

Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's suggestion that the Fed's 
two interest rate hikes this year seem to be keeping inflation 
under control. The Nasdaq was up 91.21 at 2,966.43. The Dow Jones

Yankees for the third time in four years at a rally in front of

``Let's go Yankees!''

<HEADLINE> NBC's Gray Criticized by Colleagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Now Jim Gray knows how Pete Rose feels.  
</P>
<P>
	The NBC sports reporter, whose relentless interview with Rose  
before Game 2 of the World Series nearly generated as many 
headlines as the play on the field, is trying to put it all behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	That's exactly what Rose has tried to do for the past 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
	But Gray broke the No. 1 rule of reporting.  
</P>
<P>
	Never become part of the story.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reporter's worst nightmare when you become the story,''  
CBS reporter Armen Keteyian said. ``You do not want to be the story 
-- you are there to inform and enlighten the audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray is at one end of the spectrum, a hard-nosed reporter  
unafraid to ask the tough questions. Ahmad Rashad is at the other 
end, known for his soft line of questioning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim is a very, very good reporter and will ask the question  
that few people will, but as my mother told me, 'There is a time 
and a place','' Keteyian said. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol, who admitted the Rose  
interview might have gone on too long, called Gray ``the best 
reporter in the business, maybe ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray hasn't said much about the interview, other than to defend  
it and later apologize on national TV before Game 3. NBC spokesman 
Ed Markey said Gray is trying to move on. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Gray's colleagues felt he might have crossed the line  
when he kept asking Rose about whether he bet on baseball. The 
interview came moments after Rose took part in the All-Century team 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's exactly why players are leery of the media,'' said  
former San Francisco 49er Brent Jones, now a CBS analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim Gray couldn't take the heat and he didn't have the guts to  
say he's wrong,'' Jones added. ``He got what he's done to every 
other guy back in return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray was snubbed after the third game of the World Series when  
Chad Curtis refused to answer his questions on live TV. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a pretty decent reputation, but he's only got three  
minutes with Pete,'' said ESPN radio co-host Rob Dibble, who played 
for Rose with the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``As for the forum, it was not the time or the place to expect  
Pete to give that type of statement,'' added Dibble, whose father 
was a news reporter for 50 years. ``I don't think Jim Gray is the 
conscience of America. I don't think him asking Pete on national TV 
was what NBC wanted him to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Lyons, who would have been in Gray's place if Fox had the  
rights to this year's World Series, has a lot of respect for Gray 
but agreed he went overboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jim took it a little too far and I think he feels that way,  
too,'' Lyons said. ``Once he didn't get the answer he wanted, he 
decided to keep badgering Pete. ... I think it was OK to ask once 
because of Pete's history.''

	 *COSELL:* After working for a year to get the family's approval  
and another two years to finish the project, HBO's one-hour 
documentary on Howard Cosell debuts Monday at 8 p.m. ET. 
</P>
<P>
	It shows many sides of the most controversial sportscaster ever.  
</P>
<P>
	``It really does a great job of making you feel the emotions,''  
said ``Monday Night Football'' analyst Boomer Esiason, in New York 
last week for the screening. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the focus on the documentary is placed on Cosell's  
stormy relationship with ``MNF'' partners Don Meredith and Frank 
Gifford. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, I was very pleased with it,'' said Cosell's daughter,  
Hilary. ``But it needed more with Alex Karras and Fran Tarkenton. 
Generations of schoolchildren need to know that it wasn't 14 years 
of just Howard, Don and Frank.''

	 *FRIENDLY ADVICE:* Brent Jones roomed with San Francisco  
quarterback Steve Young for nearly a decade. His words of advice 
for his best friend: Quit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he ought to retire,'' the CBS analyst said Thursday.  
``He doesn't have anything left to prove. That seems to be the 
consensus. I haven't spoken to one rational person who says to keep 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Young sustained a concussion earlier this season that has kept  
him on the sideline ever since. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's really thinking this one through,'' Jones said. ``He's so  
well-spoken and well-schooled that he may have a bigger platform 
out of football than in it. But he's so competitive that he wants 
to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TUBE BITS:* NBC World Series analyst Joe Morgan, left off the  
All-Century team, on the selections: ``The committee should have 
used their five picks more wisely. Fans voted better than the 
committee. Not to have one Latin player on the team is not right. 
And they are basically saying that the Negro leagues never 
existed.'' ... ESPN's Chris Fowler makes his college football 
play-by-play debut Thursday. ... USA Home Entertainment and MLB 
released a 71-minute All-Century video on Tuesday. ... ABC college 
football broadcaster Brad Nessler teams with Lynn Swann, normally a 
sideline reporter, for Saturday's Oklahoma-Colorado game. Swann 
moves into the booth because Bob Griese has the week off. ... ESPN 
introduces ``SuperStrator'', a new telestrator, during Sunday 
night's Tampa Bay-Detroit game. ... NBA.com TV, the first full-time 
TV network created by a league, begins Tuesday with Rashad as host.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Warns Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's new president inaugurated  
his Cabinet on Friday with a firm warning that the corruption that 
has infested the country for decades will no longer be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
	President Abdurrahman Wahid took office last week, raising hopes  
that he can continue Indonesia's transition to democracy after more 
than 30 years of autocratic rule capped by two years of political 
instability, economic crisis and civil unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid has promised that the Cabinet sworn in Friday will be free  
of the graft rampant under authoritarian President Suharto and his 
successor, B.J. Habibie. He indicated that his attorney general 
would be on the lookout for corruption and would prosecute any 
officials involved in it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope all of you can live simply, fairly and honestly and be  
able to perform your duties as expected by the people,'' Wahid told 
his Cabinet during its swearing-in ceremony. ``If any among you are 
brought to court by the attorney general, then it is better for you 
to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each minister took an oath pledging ``not to receive any gifts  
from anybody who I know, or think, will have a hidden interest 
related to my duty and position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Wahid worked to restore confidence in the government, a  
scandal under his predecessor flared anew. A report by auditors at 
PricewaterhouseCoopers, obtained by Dow Jones Newswires on Friday, 
said that the equivalent of $80 million transferred out of Bank 
Bali to a company with ties to the former ruling Golkar Party made 
its way into dozens of domestic and foreign bank accounts. The 
accounts include those of former legislators and the party itself. 
</P>
<P>
	When the new ministers gathered for their official group photo  
in front of the presidential palace, hundreds of people congregated 
in a park across the street shouting: ``What will happen to our 
jobs?'' The protesters were members of the Information Ministry and 
Social Affairs Ministry, both of which were eliminated from the 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid, who has suffered two strokes in recent years and is  
nearly blind, headed out of the palace with his wife in a golf cart 
to talk with the protesters, but the crowd suddenly surged forward, 
forcing him to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demonstrations are nothing new for me,'' Wahid said. ``I  
wanted to go to speak to them. But my security men said it was 
unsafe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts, financial markets and foreign governments have  
responded well to the Cabinet lineup, which includes 
representatives of all major political parties, religions, ethnic 
groups and islands across Indonesia. It also reduces the powerful 
military's influence in the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Wahid warned his new ministers that they face the ``tough job''  
of maintaining national unity and fixing the economy, which was 
hard-hit by Asia's financial meltdown. He said it also should push 
for greater democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Cabinet is the product of history and carries the hopes  
of the Indonesian people to change our lives,'' Wahid said.

<HEADLINE> Home Ownership Rate Hits High Note </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More Americans than ever are buying their own  
homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported Thursday that the home ownership rate  
climbed to an all-time high of 67 percent in the July through 
September quarter as a record number of minorities bought houses. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're closing the homeownership gap dividing whites from  
minorities and city residents from suburbanites, but the gap 
remains far too wide, said HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 70.5 million families -- 67 percent of American  
households -- owned their homes in the third quarter, the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development said. 
</P>
<P>
	That breaks down into 58 million white families; 6.1 million  
blacks; 4.2 million Hispanics; and 2.2 million Asian Americans, 
Native Americans and Pacific Islanders owning homes. All are record 
numbers, HUD said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong economic growth, low unemployment and stock and bond  
market gains are making Americans feel wealthy and in the buying 
mood, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second quarter, 66.6 percent of American families owned  
their own home, HUD said. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-quarter gain reflected big gains in ownership rates  
among minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The home ownership rate for blacks rose to 47 percent in the  
third quarter, up from a 45.8 percent rate in the April-June 
quarter. The rate for Hispanics was 45.5 percent in the third 
quarter compared with a 44.9 percent rate in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the rate of growth in the third quarter was faster for  
minorities than for whites, the share of minorities owning their 
own home continues to lag behind whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The home ownership rate for whites in the third quarter was 73.5  
percent, up from 73.2 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The home ownership rate among central-city residents rose to  
50.5 percent in the third quarter, up from 50.1 percent, and the 
rate for suburban residents held steady at 73.7 percent, HUD said. 
</P>
<P>
	By region, the home ownership rate rose to 63.6 percent from  
62.8 percent in the Northeast. In the Midwest, it grew to 72.1 
percent from 71.2 percent. In the South home ownership was up to 
69.3 percent from 68.9 percent and in the West it fell to 60.8 
percent from 61.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Koop Criticized for Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dr. C. Everett Koop, the influential former  
U.S. Surgeon General turned Internet entrepreneur, is drawing 
criticism for having told Congress in March that medical latex 
gloves were safe without disclosing he had received money from one 
of the biggest manufacturers of the gloves. 
</P>
<P>
	Many health experts maintain that the gloves are a serious,  
potentially life-threatening risk to nurses and others who are 
allergic to latex. Some of the nation's biggest hospitals have 
begun replacing them with gloves made of other materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The allergy ``is a very serious disease,'' Michelle Nawar,  
communications and education specialist for the American Nurses 
Association, said Friday. ``It can be a debilitating, career-ending 
illness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the five deaths from using the gloves that were reported  
to the government involved nurses, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Beth Zupa, a spokeswoman for Dr. Koop, said he had done  
nothing improper in not disclosing the four-year, $1 million 
consulting contract he signed in 1994 with NBF, a vitamin maker. 
She said NBF was later acquired by WRP Corp., based in Itasca, 
Ill., the latex glove manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Koop terminated his contract with WRP in February 1997  
because it was not pursuing the vitamin business for which he had 
been engaged, Ms. Zupa said. The contract, disclosed by the company 
in a routine filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, was 
first reported in Friday's editions of The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Koop's contract with NBF ``was to consult strictly and  
solely on a vitamin product line that they were developing'' and 
was unrelated to the latex glove operation, Ms. Zupa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, Dr. Koop should have disclosed his relationship with  
WRP when he testified at a House subcommittee hearing on March 25, 
said John Stone, a spokesman for Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., who 
is vice chairman of the investigative subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	In that testimony, Dr. Koop dismissed concerns about the latex  
gloves as ``borderline hysteria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stone said Norwood ``has been adamant about'' witnesses  
disclosing their ties and interests when they appear before the 
panel, the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House 
Committee on Education and the Work Force. 
</P>
<P>
	If a witness before Congress receives money from a company,  
``You need to tell us that,'' Stone insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	Because Dr. Koop had terminated his consulting contract before  
his congressional appearance this year, he was not required under 
federal ethics rules to register as a paid lobbyist for WRP. 
</P>
<P>
	But critics say that because the former surgeon general is  
widely respected and trusted as a health expert, he should have 
disclosed the connection. Dr. Koop gained prestige when he fought 
against the tobacco industry as the government's top health 
official in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He also was criticized for what were considered inadequate  
disclosures of corporate sponsorship by his health information 
Internet site called drkoop.com. Dr. Koop previously was entitled 
to a commission on products sold through the site, but that was 
changed in response to the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Koop made an estimated $20 million to $25 million profit  
when the site went public in June. 
</P>
<P>
	A WRP filing to the SEC last November said in a footnote that an  
unnamed individual who acted ``as a spokesman for the company'' had 
received $656,250 for his services through February 1997. The 
company had total sales of around $65 million last year, up from 
$51.4 million in 1997, an SEC filing shows. 
</P>
<P>
	An official of WRP, speaking Friday on condition of anonymity,  
confirmed that the individual in question was Dr. Koop. He declined 
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Zupa, the spokeswoman for Dr. Koop, said he was traveling  
and was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times also reported that Dr. Koop made a phone call in the  
spring of 1997 to Dr. Linda Rosenstock, director of the National 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which was about to 
issue a warning on the potential dangers of latex gloves. According 
to the newspaper, Dr. Koop told her the language of the warning was 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rosenstock couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

	Clinton Seeks Hate-Crime Law  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- President Clinton, frustrated by two years of  
failure, made a plea Friday night for Congress to pass a new 
hate-crime law, seeking to combat violence prompted by a victim's 
sexual orientation, gender or disability. ``Hate crimes victimize 
not only the victim but they victimize society as a whole in a 
special way because they contradict the very idea of America we are 
trying to build,'' Clinton said at the Anti-Defamation League's 
annual national commission dinner. He has has been crusading for 
new hate-crimes legislation since November 1997.

	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A high school in Cleveland was closed Friday  
because police were tipped off to a possible plot for a 
Columbine-like massacre. Four white students were arrested in what 
was described as a racially motivated plot at their predominantly 
black high school. Mayor Michael R. White said that police seized 
two guns from one student's house, and that the group planned to 
get weapons from a gang. No guns or explosives were found at the 
school. One of the seven students questioned but not detained said 
the four who were arrested, all boys, had maps of South High with 
positions for each shooter.

Alfonso Gomez Mendez said Friday. It was the worst serial killing 
case ever in Colombia and likely among the worst reported anywhere. 
He identified the suspect, arrested in April, as Luis Eduardo

eve of the anniversary of a deadly mudslide that killed more than 
2,000 people during Hurricane Mitch. Katrina was expected to 
deliver as much as 10 to 15 inches of rain, with higher amounts in 
some areas, across portions of Nicaragua and Honduras, according to 
the National Hurricane Center in Miami. A tropical storm warning

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- FBI officials hope DNA evidence will be found  
on razor-lined envelopes mailed to 88 animal researchers in 13 
states. ``The blades are taped to the inside flap of the envelope 
so if you open them and put your hand in, it would cut you,'' FBI 
agent Kevin Caudle said Friday. The 88 recipients had been 
identified in a communique from a group calling itself the 
``Justice Department,'' said Jacquie Calnan, president of Americans 
for Medical Progress, a group that monitors the work of 
universities that have research facilities.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A recent poll reports more people apparently  
believe in ghosts and witches than two decades ago. A third of the 
people surveyed in a new Gallup poll said they believe in ghosts, 
three times the number who said that two decades ago. One of five 
said they believe in witches, twice the rate of the late 1970s.

fans welcomed the team back from an NHL record-tying nine-game road 
trip that produced a solid 4-2-3 record.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index soared to a new  
record, leading a broad stock market rally that was extended Friday 
on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's suggestion that the 
Fed's two interest rate hikes this year seem to be keeping 
inflation under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The remarks raised hopes that the central bank may not see the  
need for repeated additional rate hikes to keep the economy from 
overheating. Interest rates tumbled on the inflation-sensitive 
government bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 107.33 to close at  
10,729.86, adding to its 227.64-point surge on Thursday. The Dow 
ended the week up 259.61 points, or 2.5 percent, adding to last 
week's 450-point advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite  
index rose 91.21 to close at 2,966.43, well above the record close 
of 2,915.95 reached on Oct. 11. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 
20.49 to 1,362.93. 
</P>
<P>
	The rally on Wall Street came on the 70th anniversary of the  
1929 stock market crash, when the Dow plunged 11.73 percent in a 
single session. October has been a tough month for stocks in the 
years since, with huge selloffs in both 1987 and 1997, and traders 
were glad to put the month behind them. 
</P>
<P>
	Optimism also was raised by remarks from Greenspan at a Florida  
meeting of business executives late Thursday, where he said a 
significant upturn in the growth of productivity in recent years 
has boosted the U.S. economy and kept inflationary pressures under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also suggested that the Fed's two interest rate hikes  
this summer are keeping the economy on a path of noninflationary 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, the market has been dominated by a debate over  
whether the Fed will raise interest rates for the third time this 
year when its policy-makers meet on Nov. 16. Some traders had 
worried about prospects for more increases down the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan didn't say what the Fed will do. He also warned that  
the central bank will be particularly alert in the coming months to 
any signs of slowing productivity -- the amount of output per hour 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Greenspan suggested that he needs to see more  
evidence the economy is slowing in order to keep the central bank 
from raising interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
	The government reported Thursday that economic activity was  
strong in the third quarter without signs of renewed inflation, 
figures that fueled the market's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the midst of a big rally, and it should carry  
through over several more sessions,'' said Alan Ackerman, senior 
vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``But that doesn't mean that 
this is going to last. We still have a bunch of big hurdles ahead 
of us before the Fed's next meeting in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Remember, the buyers are quick on the trigger, but so are the  
sellers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Intel rose 5 1/4 to 77 7/16 on the Nasdaq Stock Market  
after the world's largest maker of computer chips said production 
this year will not be disrupted by the earthquake in Taiwan or the 
Year 2000 computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's announcement late Thursday helped the rest of the chip  
industry. Applied Materials rose 6 1/16 to 89 13/16, and Sun 
Microsystems gained 7 3/16 to 105 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin shares fell 2 15/16 to 20 after the defense  
conglomerate slashed its earnings estimate for the year 2000 and 
its president and chief operating officer, Peter B. Teets, 
announced his retirement, blaming himself for the earnings 
shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Akamai Technologies, a maker of technology used to  
boost the efficiency of the Internet, soared in an initial public 
offering. Akamai was priced at 26 per share, opened at 110, and 
closed at 145 3/16 on the Nasdaq, the fourth-biggest gain in 
history for a stock making its IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in  
Charlotte, N.C., noted that the technology sector dominated 
Friday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market does look impressive,'' he said. ``But it has to  
find some other leadership beyond the techs and the financial 
stocks. When they're the only two groups driving the market, it 
doesn't signify a lot of strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One other bastion of strength Friday: Paper stocks, which  
benefited from positive comments from Merrill Lynch analysts. 
International Paper rose 4 3/16 to 52 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-5 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE volume was heavy at 1.37 billion 
shares, topping the robust 1.35 billion shares that changed hands 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.82 to 428.63.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas markets also were lifted by Wall Street's new strength.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 3.0 percent. Germany's DAX  
index gained 0.9 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 1.7 percent, and 
France's CAC-40 rose 3.0 percent.

<HEADLINE> Cavaliers Center Ilgauskas Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Cavaliers center Zydrunas Ilgauskas  
will start the season on the injured list with a sore left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas will miss at least the first eight weeks of the  
season, the Cavs said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was made after consulting with doctors at the  
Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Thomas Clanton in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not going to speculate beyond that at this time,'' said  
vice president and general manager Jim Paxson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is the long-term health of a very good player. We  
will not rush into anything that is only a short-term approach,'' 
Paxson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-foot-3 Ilgauskas missed the all but five games last season  
with a broken bone in the same foot. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a toe infection earlier this month that required  
treatment with antibiotics, and didn't play in any exhibition 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cavs signed Ilgauskas to a six-year, $71 million contract  
extension just before last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Ilgauskas has a long history of foot problems. He broke his  
right foot in 1995 and 1996, keeping him out both years.

<HEADLINE> City Salutes World Champion Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The city's No. 1 New York Yankees booster is  
hinting again that skipping school today to attend a victory parade 
for the World Series champions wouldn't be such a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to me that this would make an excellent school trip,  
writing assignment,'' Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday as he 
announced plans for the city's third ticker-tape parade for the 
Yankees in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees clinched a record 25th World Series title Wednesday  
night at Yankee Stadium, sweeping the Atlanta Braves in four 
straight games -- the second straight year the Bronx Bombers have 
gone unbeaten in the Fall Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Yankees supporters were expected to jam  
lower Broadway for the parade, which was to start at noon, followed 
90 minutes later by an invitation-only rally at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew warned students  
considering an unauthorized day off for the parade that ``tomorrow 
is a school day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five city high schools plan to send their marching bands,  
however: James Madison, Susan Wagner, Fort Hamilton, Tottenville 
and Curtis. Also scheduled to perform is the All City High School 
Marching Band, made up of students from throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Commissioner Howard Safir said 3,500 officers would be  
assigned to the parade, and more would be added if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	Admission to the City Hall rally was limited to 5,000 invited  
guests. 
</P>
<P>
	Sporting a blue Yankees hat and jacket during Thursday's press  
conference, Giuliani could not resist taking a swipe at Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, his all-but-declared rival for a U.S. Senate seat 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would invite Mrs. Clinton to the parade and rally,  
Giuliani responded: ``I guess, but she might show up in Chicago or 
something, I don't know. I honestly looked last night for her at 
the game, and I couldn't ... maybe she'll show up for tonight's 
game. There will be a lot of seats for tonight's game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani paused, then said, he was ``just kidding around, like  
fellow Yankee fans (do).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, at a White House ceremony to toast the  
Yankees' 1998 World Series title, Mrs. Clinton declared she was a 
lifelong Yankees fan, although in the past she'd said that she was 
a diehard Chicago Cubs loyalist. 
</P>
<P>
	She explained that in the American League, the Yanks are her  
favorite, while her hometown Cubs are tops in her heart among 
National League clubs.

<HEADLINE> NYC Salutes World Champion Yankees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- George Steinbrenner hoisted a broom from a  
parade float. Darryl Strawberry broke down in tears. And millions 
of fans staged another Broadway revival with a blizzard of 
confetti. 
</P>
<P>
	``This stuff never gets old,'' New York Yankees manager Joe  
Torre said at a City Hall rally after the parade Friday. ``This one 
seemed even better. I think you appreciate it more each time you do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This was the Yankees' third title -- and third parade -- in the  
last four years. A half-dozen floats carried the players, eliciting 
wild screams and chants of ``Let's go Yankees!'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a day that felt more like spring, designated hitter Chili  
Davis puffed on a victory cigar. Strawberry videotaped the roaring, 
face-painted crowd and then cried at a City Hall rally presided 
over by the city's most prominent Yankees fan, Mayor Rudolph 
Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry, who overcame colon cancer and legal problems earlier  
this season, was overcome with emotion as he acknowledged his 
manager. Torre embraced him until the outfielder composed himself 
and said, ``Thank you for caring for me, and I love you guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	World Series MVP Mariano Rivera, the unhittable reliever, had a  
float all to himself. Yogi Berra, the Hall of Fame catcher, paraded 
in a vintage car. And Steinbrenner, the Yankees' owner, rode in the 
top of a double-decker bus, brandishing a broom in tribute to his 
team's sweep of the Atlanta Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling to win in front of you fans,'' said  
shortstop Derek Jeter, with yet another World Series ring. ``With 
the exception of Yogi, everyone has a few more fingers to fill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Cone paid homage to the Yankee family -- Torre, whom he  
called the team's ``father,'' coach Don Zimmer, the ``crazy 
uncle,'' and Steinbrenner, whom he referred to as ``the very 
wealthy, eccentric grandfather.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five minutes before the parade's noon start, fans were  
lined six and seven deep on the sidewalks along the financial 
district's narrow streets. There was no official estimate on the 
size of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	The route, from the Battery to City Hall, is less than a mile.  
Many revelers never even caught a glimpse of the festivities. The 
crowd around City Hall, where each player received a key to the 
city, stretched several blocks to the Brooklyn Bridge at the 
parade's height. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jeter for mayor,'' read one sign along the route, and the  
25-year-old shortstop was clearly the most valuable player to many 
of the young women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like to marry him one day,'' said Melissa Grimsley,  
16. She and friend JoAnna DelVecchio wore Jeter jerseys and ditched 
school for the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	There was at least one arrest during the parade. A man grabbed  
by police after he ignited a small fire in the ankle-deep paper 
left along the street in the Yankees' wake. 
</P>
<P>
	At the City Hall ceremony, Yankee Stadium organist Eddie Layton  
played, and country musician Clint Black performed a song with 
special lyrics honoring the champions. 
</P>
<P>
	Cone, a potential free agent, was serenaded was a chant of ``One  
more year!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``How about two more years?'' Cone asked.  
</P>
<P>
	The mayor's administration was less gracious toward Democratic  
state assembly members who voted to repeal New York's commuter tax 
-- a move that cost the city an estimated $210 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Mayor Joseph Lhota said the invitations were rescinded to  
send a message: Don't vote against the city's interests. 
Assemblyman Paul Tonko, a Yankees fan from upstate, said he took 
away this message: ``He puts the rude in Rudy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But this was not a day for politics.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're making this a yearly tradition!'' shouted Charlie Hine,  
a UPS employee from Connecticut who skipped work for the second 
straight year to cheer his team. ``We'll be back next year!''

<HEADLINE> Three Actors Will Play Hamlet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- He's a complex character -- at least three  
personalities in one, says director Joe Banno. So the director has 
cast three actors to play him: two men and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Who's the character? ``Hamlet,'' of course, probably the most  
frequently acted part in the English-language theater. This 
interpretation, which also puts the actors in modern dress, has at 
least the tacit approval of the Folger Shakespeare Library, a noted 
U.S. repository of Shakespearean lore. 
</P>
<P>
	The library has lent its stage, built like the one where the  
play was first acted nearly 400 years ago, for performances 
starting Saturday and ending Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Hamlet had had a good shrink, this play would be a much  
more mundane affair,'' Banno said in describing the production. 
</P>
<P>
	Banno justifies his division of the part by quoting Ophelia, who  
says her indecisive boyfriend can be ``separated into eye, tongue 
and sword.'' Steve Carpenter handles the tongue part, Cam Magee 
does the eye and Kate Norris the sword. 
</P>
<P>
	She has acted both male and female Shakespearean parts in  
previous appearances at the Folger: King Richard III in the play of 
that name, and the shrewish Kate in ``The Taming of the Shrew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, Ophelia makes it even more complicated.  
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown,'' Shakespeare has  
her say, after a session with the somewhat incoherent prince. 
</P>
<P>
	``The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword.''  
</P>
<P>
	The set uses a series of mirrors which, Banno says, ``reflect,  
refract, fragment and provide alternate perspectives on the 
action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shakespeare says nothing about mirrors in his meager stage  
direction. As far as scholars can tell, he didn't use much scenery 
at all, leaving it all to the actors and to the imagination of the 
audience.

<HEADLINE> Japan Urges Stockpiling for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan, one of the most technologically  
sophisticated nations in the world, is taking the Y2K computer 
problem seriously enough that it urged citizens Friday to stockpile 
water, food and fuel ahead of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chances for problems are slim, the government said. But just in  
case, it suggested people stock up on two or three days worth of 
food and water, first-aid boxes, flashlights, radios and batteries. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning is similar to those issued by a few other nations.  
Americans were advised by the Senate, Clinton administration Y2K 
panels as well as the Red Cross to prepare a three-day supply of 
water and food, fill up on gas and keep copies of bank statements. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K experts say the event should be treated like a storm, flood  
or other natural disaster, and that people should simply be 
similarly prepared. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K glitch refers to the inability of some computers to  
recognize the difference between 1900 and 2000 because both end in 
double-0s. That could cause some computers to go haywire. 
</P>
<P>
	Some fear the millennium bug could halt trains and elevators,  
shut down water and electricity supplies, and even disrupt life 
support systems at hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, the Japanese government has kept relatively  
quiet about what it was doing to prepare. Public service ads have 
been virtually nonexistent, and many Japanese don't take the 
problem seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Construction worker Hajime Yoshida shrugged off the government  
warning. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all just political talk that makes no sense,'' Yoshida  
said. ``There won't really be a problem in the end.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many independent analysts say that Japan, among leading  
industrial nations, has lagged in its Y2K remedy efforts. The U.S. 
State Department, however, has said it considers the risks in Japan 
to be low. 
</P>
<P>
	International Monitoring, a Britain-based technology consulting  
company, says there is a low-to-moderate risk of serious 
disruptions in Japan because of year 2000-related failures. It 
predicts that the transport sector is most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese government said it was prepared to deal with any  
problems, but nevertheless told people to set aside a few tanks of 
kerosene for home heaters and keep an eye out for mistakes in their 
bank statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important for every person to prepare for the small  
possibility of short-term inconveniences in everyday living,'' it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo has not released any figures on what it has spent on  
fixing the bug. It also has not given a figure for the extra people 
the government expects to have on hand New Year's Eve to deal with 
any possible problems. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100,000 technicians from Japanese electronics companies  
plan to camp out in their offices from Dec. 31 to Jan. 4, just in 
case, according to the Japan Electronic Industry Development 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitoshi Sato, who owns a Tokyo pub equipped with its own power  
generator, said he planned to do little but withdraw a small amount 
of extra cash. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried one bit about all that computer stuff,'' he  
said. ``We can spend the New Year drinking beer.''

<HEADLINE> Jacobs, Mahaffey Tied at 6-Under  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Jacobs and John Mahaffey shot 6-under  
65s to share the first-round lead at the Pacific Bell Senior PGA 
Classic on Friday, a day the older members of the sport remembered 
Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Summerhays was a shot back in third, while Dave Stockton,  
Lee Trevino, Gary Player and Jim Thorpe all had 67s. Defending 
champion Joe Inman was in a group of seven another shot behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-four players shot par or better over the 6,575-yard  
Wilshire Country Club course where Stewart was in the minds of 
competitors and spectators and was honored in a post-round ceremony 
with a bagpipe player and many kind words. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Payne Stewart's day,'' Mahaffey said. ``There were  
grown men crying. It hits really close to home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial service was held Friday in Orlando, Fla., for  
Stewart, the PGA Tour player who was among six people killed Monday 
in the crash of a Learjet. 
</P>
<P>
	Mahaffey, in his second season on the Senior PGA Tour, was 5  
under on the back nine and had eight birdies in all . 
</P>
<P>
	``I played a really great round,'' Mahaffey said. ``It was  
extremely difficult to play golf today. We have trained our minds 
to focus on the job at hand but when I wasn't hitting a golf shot 
my mind was somewhere else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mahaffey, who won 10 times in his 27 years on the PGA Tour,  
needs to win less than $115,000 in the final two tournaments of the 
season to post his first career $1 million year. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs played errorless golf, posting six birdies without a  
bogey. His 30-foot birdie putt at No. 9 and a 22-footer at No. 12 
keyed his steady round. 
</P>
<P>
	``This course is difficult for me,'' Jacobs said. ``It's a  
straight driver's course. I only hit three drivers today and was 
scared each time I picked my driver out of the bag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs' 66 was one of the best starts for the Los Angeles native  
during a year in which he was sidelined six weeks by two minor 
operations on his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy with a 66,'' he said. ``I've come out of it a  
little the last couple of weeks and it only hurts to hit a wedge. 
But everybody out here has some pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thorpe joined the senior tour this year and is playing in his  
35th tournament. He hasn't won a senior event, but has posted two 
second-place finishes and has been in the top 10 eight times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I drove the ball well and hit a lot of fairways,'' Thorpe  
said. ``The greens are the fastest I have seen since I left 
Augusta.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also thought of Stewart on a day when the PGA Tour's two  
events canceled play so players could attend the memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Payne would have wanted us to go ahead and play,''  
Thorpe said. ``I believe it was the right decision to play.''

<HEADLINE> Hideo Nomo Spurns Phillies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- It didn't take Hideo Nomo long to decide he  
didn't want to pitch for the Philadelphia Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, who was asleep in Tokyo when the Phillies claimed him on  
waivers, awoke Friday and rejected the waiver claim, becoming a 
free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia claimed Nomo Thursday after the Milwaukee Brewers  
waived him, but contract talks didn't get far. 
</P>
<P>
	``We discussed our team and had a brief discussion about a  
multiyear deal,'' Phillies general manager Ed Wade said. ``Both 
Nomura and Nomo liked our lineup, but they felt free agency would 
be their best route at this time. They would like the opportunity 
to test the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, who has struggled to regain the brilliant form he  
possessed as a phenom with the Los Angeles Dodgers, rejected 
Milwaukee's contract offers for about $5 million a season. His 
agent, Don Nomura, wouldn't confirm reports that he was seeking a 
$27 million, three-year deal for the 31-year-old right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura also said the Phillies didn't contact him before claiming  
Nomo -- not unheard of, but curious in that the Phillies' $30 
million payroll wasn't likely to accommodate Nomo's demands. 
</P>
<P>
	The team was unlikely to pay Nomo more than star pitcher Curt  
Schilling, who will make $5.65 million in 2000, the final season of 
a $15.45 million, three-year contract that contains a $6.5 million 
team option for 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo, the 1995 NL Rookie of the Year with the Dodgers, signed  
with the Brewers for $250,000 five months ago. The New York Mets 
cut him in spring training, and he made three minor league starts 
for the Chicago Cubs with a 1-1 record and a 3.71 ERA. Nomo didn't 
look sharp in subsequent tryouts with Milwaukee and Cleveland, but 
the pitching-poor Brewers signed him anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies considered signing Nomo last year, and could have  
gotten him at a discount because of his struggles. Instead, Nomo 
became one of the majors' biggest bargains for the Brewers, winning 
six of his first seven decisions and nine of his first 11. He 
finished 12-8 with a 4.54 ERA in 28 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomo has a 61-49 career record with a 3.82 ERA and 1,031  
strikeouts in 960 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Soldiers Tested for Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHIHUAHUA, Mexico (AP) -- Mexico's army has begun investigating  
570 soldiers based in the border state of Chihuahua after troops 
apparently burned flour instead of cocaine during a ceremony last 
week, news reports Friday said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Juan Morales Fuentes, commander of the 5th Military Zone,  
said flour instead of about 12 pounds of cocaine was burned at the 
Oct. 22 event. The ceremony was watched by schoolchildren and 
officials from the federal attorney general's office, according to 
El Diario de Chihuahua and Reforma of Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	El Diario reported Thursday that all 570 members of the 96th  
Infantry Battalion had been confined to barracks. The battalion has 
been working in anti-narcotics efforts along the U.S. border from 
western New Mexico to the Big Bend area of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico's military has taken a major role in drug interdiction in  
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Reforma quoted Morales Fuentes as saying half the men were being  
drug tested. El Diario said all would be. 
</P>
<P>
	Reforma quoted the general as saying that not all of the cocaine  
had been stolen.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Flock to Orlando for Payne  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- No matter how gorgeous the weather, no  
matter how much was riding on the outcome in tournaments in Texas 
and Mississippi, the PGA Tour decided that golf was not appropriate 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Still in shock over the plane crash that killed Payne Stewart,  
the tour canceled play at the Tour Championship and the Southern 
Farm Bureau Classic so players could attend a memorial service for 
the U.S. Open champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that we're taking the day off so we can go to the  
service,'' said Hal Sutton, the defending champion at the Tour 
Championship in Houston. ``He deserves his day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was among five people killed Monday when his Learjet  
soared uncontrolled across the Heartland until running out of fuel 
and plowing into a grassy field in South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of players were expected to be at the First Baptist  
Church of Orlando today for the memorial service. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 29 players in the Tour Championship already experienced  
the powerful emotions of paying tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first round began Thursday in Houston, players  
attended a brief but somber service on the first tee of Champions 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing 27 holes, many of them boarded private planes for  
a one-day trip to Orlando to say goodbye to Stewart one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very, very emotional for a lot of people,''  
said Davis Love III, whose father was killed in a plane crash 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Love and Tom Lehman were among those who thought about taking  
the entire week off until deciding it was best to be with their 
peers to start the grieving. After getting through a difficult day 
of golf in which the focus was far from birdies and bogeys, they 
will return to Houston on Saturday for another 27 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility exists that some will be so shook up, they will  
not want to return to Houston to resume the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see what the weekend brings,'' Love said. ``It's good  
for me to have a day off, but I don't know. You have to take each 
guy individually and see what they shot and how close they were to 
Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the European PGA Tour, players planned to pause for a moment  
of silence on the 18th green following today's round at the Volvo 
Masters in Jerez, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's impact on golf went far beyond his 18 victories around  
the world, including two U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. He was 
a member of five Ryder Cup teams and showed a passion for the 
matches like few others. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem recalled one of the last  
conversations he had with Stewart, right after the United States 
stormed from behind to win the Ryder Cup in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he had eight years left on the PGA Tour and then was  
going to play a full Senior Tour schedule,'' Finchem said. ``He was 
fully together and understood exactly where he was. He was in a 
crystal ball and could see where he was going. And I was delighted 
to know those knickers were going to be out here for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clothes were but a small part of the Stewart legacy.  
</P>
<P>
	He had the kind of flamboyant personality to wear the  
traditional golf garb -- the knickers and tam o'shanter cap often 
wore by Ben Hogan. At times, Stewart would wear a tie during 
pro-ams, which is what Walter Hagen and other great players in the 
early 20th century wore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was meticulous in the way he presented himself as a PGA  
Tour player,'' Finchem said. ``He felt so strongly about the 
importance to the presentation of our sport. He is in many ways 
irreplaceable from that perspective. He was a unique figure in 
sports and in golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For style alone, Finchem compared him to Hagen, ``a player who  
had this bigness, this presence about him, who dressed for the 
game, who brought excitement to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a substance to Stewart, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	He was perhaps the most successful player in the U.S. Open, the  
toughest championship in golf, during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won his first U.S. Open in 1991, beating Scott Simpson  
in an 18-hole playoff at Hazeltine in Minnesota. He also won in 
June at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, one of the most dramatic 
finishes in the 105-year history of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He had two other close calls in the U.S. Open, losing by two  
strokes to Lee Janzen at Baltusrol in 1993 and again finishing 
second to Janzen at The Olympic Club in San Francisco a year ago, 
when he failed to hold a 4-stroke lead going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry about me boys,'' Stewart said at the time. ``I'll  
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept his word.

<HEADLINE> Africa Trade Bill Fails in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                            *By TOM RAUM    	
</P>
<P>
                      *Associated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today rejected an attempt to move  
ahead on a bill promoting trade with Africa and the Caribbean, 
possibly dooming it for the year despite a fresh appeal from 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate turned to other matters after Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., failed to win the needed 60 votes to overcome 
delaying tactics by opponents and a barrage of amendments -- 
including some offered by the bill's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Lott later said he would try again next week to bring  
up the measure for vote. 
</P>
<P>
	He also began negotiating with Democrats, making a key  
concession to them: offering to permit a Senate vote on a 
Democratic proposal to raise the minimum wage in exchange for their 
support for moving to a quick vote on the trade bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic aides said there still was no deal, and much remained  
to get worked out. But they said there was a chance that the trade 
measure could be revived. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats had opposed what they characterized as strong-arm  
tactics by Lott in trying to limit their ability to amend the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota protested  
what he called ``the level of complicity and the extraordinary 
encumbrances the majority demands of this body each and every day 
we legislate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a 46-45 vote, the Senate rejected Lott's efforts to limit the  
number of amendments that could be offered to the measure and to 
bring debate to a conclusion. The Senate had been debating the bill 
most of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the measure came mainly from textile-state  
senators, who claimed the reductions of tariffs and quotas for 
African-made products would hurt the U.S. garment industry, and 
from some labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats voted as a bloc against the Lott's motion.  
</P>
<P>
	Proposed amendments ranged from a Democratic move to raise the  
$5.15 hourly minimum wage by $1 to an effort by Midwestern 
farm-state senators to ease agricultural sanctions on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible compromise discussed after today's Senate vote:  
moving the minimum-wage debate to separate legislation that would 
overhaul the bankruptcy code. The bankruptcy bill is expected to 
come before the Senate next week. 
</P>
<P>
	The timing of the vote couldn't have been worse in terms of U.S.  
efforts to build closer ties with Africa. It came as Nigeria's 
president, Olusegun Obasanjo, was in Washington and shortly after 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright returned from an African 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of African ambassadors to the United States watched from  
the Senate gallery as the vote was taken. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which has been considered for five years and  
passed twice by the House, would lower tariffs and quotas on 
products from the nations of sub-Saharan Africa. Sponsors had 
modified it to also include Caribbean and Central American nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who want to kill this bill have done a masterful job,''  
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee and a key sponsor of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the measure had been shunted aside -- even though  
it had the support of Clinton, Lott and Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, at a joint White House news conference with Nigerian  
President Olusegun Obasanjo, said Thursday it was ``vital that the 
Senate approve the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which is now 
pending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to recognize that barriers to trade are barriers to  
opportunity for Africans working hard to catch up to the global 
economy and for Americans who want to work with them,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said the Senate's failure to pass the measure now would be  
``a major setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is inexcusable for this legislation not to proceed,'' Roth  
said in a Senate speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate took up the African trade bill earlier in the week,  
but the legislation quickly got bogged down in partisan bickering. 
</P>
<P>
	For two years in a row, the House has passed the underlying  
legislation, designed to spur economic growth and private 
investment in 48 sub-Saharan countries. But it keeps stalling in 
the Senate because of unrelated issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth and other sponsors hoped to amend the measure to give the  
same trade preferences to Caribbean and Central American nations. 
Under Lott's policy, that amendment would be allowed because it is 
germane.

<HEADLINE> IBM Announces Organic Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers at IBM have created a transistor  
made of a combination of organic and inorganic semiconducting 
materials, according to a report in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM researchers said that the hybrid transistor material ``self  
assembles,'' crystallizing from a liquid solution at low 
temperatures. The completed chip is a sandwich with alternating 
layers of inorganic and organic layers, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Semiconductors made of silicon must be manufactured at high  
temperatures and some electronic displays must be made with both 
high temperatures and a vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	The hybrid transistors can be made more easily, the study said,  
while achieving the operating properties like that of amorphous 
silicon, the material use now to make flat-panel displays. 
</P>
<P>
	The new hybrids might someday be used in mobile computers,  
cellular telephones and new products, such as an electronic 
newspaper than could be folded up and put in a briefcase, the 
report said.

<HEADLINE> Anxiety Gnaws at Hurricane Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Flooding from Hurricane Floyd did more than  
sweep away possessions and destroy property. Many here say it also 
carried away peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Tyson, whose Princeville home was flooded, said worry has  
deprived her of the most elemental of comforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sleep?'' she said. ``You just lay there thinking about how  
you're going to replace what you've lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Then you hear somebody is giving away some help, or a little  
money, and you worry you won't get there in time to get anything,'' 
she said. ``There's people getting up at 12:30 at night to get to 
where they're giving away things -- sleeping there, so they can try 
to get a little something. It's pitiful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband Joe said his acquaintances have turned testy.  
</P>
<P>
	``You just say something, and people want to fight you,'' he  
said. People are ``under so much stress now they can hardly make 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Red Cross sent 244 mental health workers to the  
damaged region, a deployment second in size only to the Oklahoma 
City bombing. At service centers, counselors are seeing people with 
anxiety, upset stomachs, illnesses and nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are normal people having a normal reaction to an  
abnormal situation,'' said Dorothy Corless, a Red Cross mental 
health worker in eastern North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd, which drenched the region with up to 20 inches of rain,  
was by far the worst of three hurricanes and a tropical weather 
system that besieged eastern North Carolina in September and 
October. More than 15,000 homes remain uninhabitable. Recovery is 
expected to take years. 
</P>
<P>
	Counselors say the youngest are hit particularly hard by the  
loss of all that was familiar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruby Best's children recoil from the rain, associating it with  
fleeing their home in the dark before the brown waters of the 
nearby Tar River ruined their Princeville home. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughter says, `Momma, I don't want to go home again,'''  
Best said. ``I tell her, `Baby, we've got to get a home to go to 
first.''' 
</P>
<P>
	George Burdick has managed to keep calm despite losing his home  
and cattle, along with a dog. While his Martin County farm was 
awash in floodwaters, he and his wife spent weeks in shelters and 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	With disaster surrounding him, Burdick said he's worried more  
for others. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe the full impact of what we lost hasn't hit me yet, but I  
feel like we're so much better off than other folks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	As Burdick talked with Red Cross counselor Gordon Drummond, the  
eyes of his wife, Mary Kate, filled with tears. ``He won't say 
it,'' she said of her husband, ``but I'm afraid we're going to lose 
everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drummond said work will continue ``to help people get refocused  
and think about what they can do today.'' But he acknowledged 
residents have it tough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Around every corner, there's another corner,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Drummond's center, which serves eight counties, had 3,223  
counseling cases in the first five weeks after Floyd. Counselors 
found that rural residents seemed to suffer more than urban 
dwellers because the floods wiped out their safety net of 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're at a hotel. I'm in a trailer. Other neighbors are in a  
shelter,'' Drummond said. ``It just adds to the stress because 
you're used to being part of a group, and suddenly that support 
isn't there.''

<HEADLINE>  NHL Hurricanes Open New Arena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- William Moss and his two buddies found  
their seats quickly Friday night after the doors to the Raleigh 
Entertainment and Sports Arena opened. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is 100 times better than Greensboro,'' said Moss, 14, who  
was sitting up against the glass behind the goal. 
</P>
<P>
	For the past two years, fans who wanted to attend a Carolina  
Hurricanes home game had to drive to Greensboro, 80 miles from 
team's official home city. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, Carolina has a permanent home -- a $154 million,  
18,500-seat arena across from North Carolina State's Carter-Finley 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	The tan concrete oval with aqua-colored glass windows dominates  
the local landscape. Inside, red and black is the main color 
scheme. Above center ice, decorated with Carolina's hurricane logo, 
is an eight-sided scoreboard with video screens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad the 'Canes are here,'' said Charlotte Mayo, who  
cheered on the Hurricanes on Friday night with a sign that said, 
``Welcome Home Y'all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carolina lost the home-opener 4-2 to New Jersey, but the  
Hurricanes enjoyed being in their new home. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was phenomenal. We came out and played a sound  
game,'' rookie defenseman David Tanabe said. ``I enjoyed being on 
the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before Carolina faced off with the Devils, fans were treated to  
a video montage of Hurricanes' highlights to the music of ``Top 
Gun.'' Swing band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy played a few tunes while 
dancers performed on rugs laid on top of the face-off circles. 
</P>
<P>
	Another video showed Carolina's hog mascot, Stormy, running  
through the state to find his way to Raleigh. The trip did not 
include Greensboro, which ranked last in NHL attendance last year. 
Stormy finally got on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle in Durham to 
arrive at the arena. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Hurricanes' lineup was announced, a red Southeast  
Division championship banner was unveiled to a standing ovation. 
The crowd then grew quiet for several seconds in memory of 
Hurricanes defenseman Steve Chiasson, who died in a wreck while 
driving drunk last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	NHL commissioner Gary Bettman gave the arena two thumbs up.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Hurricanes have a terrific home,'' he said before the  
game. ``This is making a new beginning that I think will do nothing 
but bring success to the Triangle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pat and Charles Combs drove an hour from Goldsboro and arrived  
at 3:30 p.m. to watch the pre-game festivities outside the arena. A 
rock band, clowns and a man on stilts entertained fans waiting for 
the doors to open. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Hurricanes bent red, black and white balloons  
into hockey sticks and hats. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're our favorite team,'' Pat Combs said. ``I didn't like  
hockey, then they got me hooked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials originally hoped to open the facility in time for the  
Special Olympics in late June; then deadlines of Sept. 1 and Sept. 
15 were set. Carolina played the first nine games this season on 
the road to allow more time to finish construction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great for the team to finally have a home,'' said Mark  
Baumann, who drove from New Jersey with his 10-year-old son to 
cheer on the Devils. ``You just hope they get enough fan support so 
they can stay here.''

<HEADLINE> Disney Book Co. Loses Jacket Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Book-jacket blurbs that make verifiably  
false claims aren't entitled to First Amendment protections in 
California, an appellate court ruled, setting a precedent that 
should give many publishers pause. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruling against the Walt Disney Corp.'s publishing arm in a  
lawsuit involving the ``Beardstown Ladies Investment Club'' books 
and video, the court said promotional statements on the covers are 
commercial speech, and therefore must satisfy a different standard. 
</P>
<P>
	``When false or misleading,'' such statements are ``entitled to  
no First Amendment protection at all and may be entirely 
prohibited,'' California's First Appellate District ruled 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision means publishers may have to do some hard thinking  
about how they promote books and videotapes sold in California, 
particularly in the get-rich-quick genre, according to John Baker, 
editorial director for Publishers Weekly in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, the implications for publishers would be very  
grave,'' Baker said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacket copy writers are already prone to exaggeration, Baker  
noted. If such statements are treated in court as commercial 
speech, ``publishers should be even more alarmed at the possibility 
of an oversell coming back to haunt them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Keimer sued Buena Vista Books Inc. on April 2, 1998,  
accusing the Disney subsidiary of false advertising and unfair 
business practices for promotional statements on five books and a 
video based on the investment advice of the women's club in 
Beardstown, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``Learn how to outperform mutual funds and professional money  
managers 3 to 1,'' was one claim. Another said the women earned an 
average of 23.4 percent annually on their investments from 1984 to 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The women were not named in the lawsuit, although their ghost  
writer, Seth Godin Productions, is among the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	After questions were raised about the amateur investors'  
remarkable success, auditors discovered their actual annual rate of 
return was 9.1 percent. The women apologized, blaming a simple data 
input error, and the publisher issued correction slipstwo weeks 
before Keimer filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Disney continues to use inflated claims to promote the  
books, according to court pleadings, and the cover advertised on 
Amazon.com Thursday still promises a 23.4 percent return, Keimer's 
attorney noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Keimer, who sued on behalf of the general public, wants Disney  
to stop making the false claims, and to publish retractions or 
corrections. He also wants Disney to give up its profits from sales 
of the books and video. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit was dismissed by Superior Court Judge David Garcia on  
Sept. 30, 1998 after Disney claimed the book jacket and video cover 
statements merely repeated the contents of the material within, and 
therefore had an absolute protection under the constitutional right 
to freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
	But the appellate court said Disney is responsible for its own  
advertising claims, which must be judged independently to see if 
they conform with California's Unfair Trade Practices Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Disney cannot shield itself from the statute's mandates by  
linking its advertising to the books' content,'' the court ruled, 
sending the case back to trial and ordering Disney to pay the costs 
of Keimer's appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Landers, the publicity director at Disney's Hyperion  
Press, the brand name for Buena Vista Books, said she couldn't 
comment on pending litigation.

<HEADLINE> NHL Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	With Steve Shields making the saves, the San Jose Sharks put a  
stop to their three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	Shields made 22 saves as the streaky Sharks got back to winning  
with a 3-2 victory over the Nashville Predators on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was kind of a must-win for us. We didn't want to lose  
another one,'' said Niklas Sundstrom, who scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks have been a roller-coaster team this season. They  
opened with a three-game winning streak before losing two straight. 
Then they won four straight, then lost three in a row before 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sharks remained among the leaders in the Pacific Division,  
the NHL's toughest so far. Los Angeles kept pace with a 5-3 victory 
over Pittsburgh, and Phoenix defeated Vancouver 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, it was Boston 7, Tampa Bay 3; Calgary 4, Ottawa 3 in  
overtime; and Philadelphia 5, Colorado 4 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Shields, who had limited experience in three seasons with the  
Buffalo Sabres before being traded to the Sharks in June 1998, 
started this season as the backup to Mike Vernon. But he has taken 
over the No. 1 role by building a 7-3 record with a 2.01 
goals-against average. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I saw most of the shots. I don't remember giving up  
any bad rebounds,'' Shields said. ``We haven't been playing well. 
Tonight was a little better. But we still need improvement in our 
work ethic. To beat anyone, we have to work hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owen Nolan scored his ninth goal for the Sharks, one behind the  
league-leading 10 scored by Montreal's Brian Savage. 
</P>
<P>
	Patric Kjellberg and Sergei Krivokrasov scored for the  
Predators, who had a three-game winning streak snapped. Goalie Mike 
Dunham took his first loss of the season after winning his first 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
                         *Kings 5, Penguins 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Luc Robitaille and Glen Murray snapped a tie with goals 11  
seconds apart in the third period as Los Angeles beat Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins led 2-0 before the Kings scored four consecutive  
goals in front of new Penguins owner Mario Lemieux, who watched 
from a luxury box at Staples Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Two nights ago, the Kings rallied for a 5-2 victory over  
Washington with five consecutive goals. They closed their first 
homestand in the new arena with three straight victories. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Coyotes 4, Canucks 1    	
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Roenick had two goals and two assists, including his  
800th career point, Phoenix won at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov's shutout bid was foiled when Bill  
Muckalt scored with .06 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	Teppo Numminen had two goals and an assist, and Keith Tkachuk  
set up a pair as the Coyotes (6-2-3) matched a franchise record for 
most wins in the month of October, a mark the club has reached four 
other times, most recently going 6-4-2 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Bruins 7, Lightning 3    	
</P>
<P>
	Dave Andreychuk scored a franchise record-tying four goals, two  
of them in Boston's four-goal first period, as the Bruins chased 
Darren Puppa and beat Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Andreychuk's third career four-goal game, and his 11th  
time scoring at least three. He also has a five-goal game -- against 
Boston on Feb. 6, 1986, when he was playing for the Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bruins, who have been in the NHL since 1924, have never had  
a player score five goals in a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Tallas stopped 22 shots as the Bruins won at home for the  
first time this season after a loss and two ties. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Flames 4, Senators 3, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Shantz's second goal of the game, at 3:07 of overtime,  
lifted Calgary to victory over Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Shantz, who also tied the game 2-2 in the second period, poked a  
loose puck past goalie Ron Tugnutt from a scramble in front of the 
net, giving the Flames just their second win in the last seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Valeri Bure had a goal and three assists and Phil Housley added  
a goal and two assists for the Flames. Andre Roy, Magnus Arvedson 
and Radek Bonk scored for the Senators, who lost at home for the 
first time in six games. 
</P>
<P>
                      *Flyers 5, Avalanche 4, OT    	
</P>
<P>
	Valeri Zelepukin scored with 8.2 seconds left in overtime as  
Philadelphia bounced back after blowing a four-goal lead to beat 
visiting Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelepukin skated in on goalie Marc Denis and flicked a  
backhanded shot between his pads, atoning for what had been one of 
the Flyers' worst collapses in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 4-0 in the third, the Avalanche stunned the Flyers with  
four goals on eight shots in 8:09. Alex Tanguay and Milan Hejduk 
each scored twice. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the near-debacle, the Flyers won for the fifth time in  
six games and tied New Jersey for first place in the Atlantic 
Division. Colorado lost for the third time in four games.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's jobless rate edged lower in September, but  
officials said the overall economic environment remained severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Unemployment dropped to 4.6 percent from 4.7 percent in August,  
the Management and Coordination Agency said today. Nearly every 
sector showed increases in job offers. 
</P>
<P>
	The report comes as the Japanese economy is still fighting to  
emerge from its deepest downturn in decades. While the jobless rate 
is dropping, the figures do not suggest a robust comeback. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic environment is still severe,'' Taichi Sakaiya,  
head of the Economic Planning Agency, was quoted by Kyodo News 
agency. ``The production figures are good, but we cannot be totally 
optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The employment numbers were ambiguous. While more men found  
work, the figures also showed frustrated jobseekers settling for 
temporary employment. It is also getting tougher for older and 
younger workers to find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the continued drop in the jobless rate was welcome.  
Unemployment had risen steadily in the first half of the year, 
peaking at a record 4.9 percent in June and July. 
</P>
<P>
	The total number of jobless came to 3.17 million in September,  
down 0.1 percent from August, the Management and Coordination 
Agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Ministry also said today that the ratio of job offers  
to job seekers, an indicator of demand for labor, edged higher, to 
0.47 in September from 0.46 in August. The ratio means that 47 jobs 
were being offered for every 100 workers seeking employment in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	The improving employment figures joined other data indicating  
that Japan could moving into recovery. The economy, for example, 
has grown for two quarters in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	But the recovery has been uneven. While first quarter growth was  
a robust 2.0 percent, the economy grew a meager 0.2 percent in the 
second quarter. Corporate downsizing is picking up pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The data released today showed every sector but construction  
registered an increase in new job offers in September compared with 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of employed men increased from levels a year earlier  
by 20,000 -- the first time in 21 months that the number of male 
workers increased from the prior year. 
</P>
<P>
	The declining jobless rate, however, partly reflected a shift  
from better compensated permanent employment to temporary jobs, as 
the unemployed settled for less desirable work. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of part-time and temporary workers rose from levels a  
year earlier by 210,000, or 4.3 percent, to 5.12 million. The 
number of such workers has increased in every month since September 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	And payroll cost trimming by corporations led to a 0.2 percent  
drop in the number of full-time workers -- the 21st straight month 
of declines, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> NBA Adapting to Rule Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After the vote on the sale of the Vancouver  
Grizzlies was taken off the agenda, the NBA Board of Governors were 
updated on rule changes at their meeting on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Billionaire Bill Laurie, who already owns the St. Louis Blues  
and the Kiel Center, bought the Grizzlies from John McCaw for about 
$150 million on Sept. 25 amidst speculation that he intended to 
move the team to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	The board was expected to vote whether to approve or reject the  
sale on Friday. However, they did not made a decision. If the 
Grizzlies leaves Vancouver, he must pay McCaw $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the expansion agreement when the Grizzlies  
entered the league in 1995, the team cannot move until the 2001-02 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors also heard a progress report on the new rules  
designed to open up the game. 
</P>
<P>
	NBA senior vice president of basketball operations Rod Thorn  
said that so far in the preseason, with the new changes in place, 
there have been fewer foul shots attempted than in the past two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rule changes have been put in place to decrease the  
amount of clutching and grabbing, making the game less physical. 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked at length about what has transpired during the  
preseason,'' Thorn said. ``The vast majority felt that we're on the 
right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The major change involves a defender who uses a hand check or a  
forearm. He is immediately whistled for a foul. Likewise, an 
offensive player who moves while setting a screen will get tagged 
with a foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rule bars defenders from impeding offensive players  
cutting through the lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been getting more offensive fouls, but not more shooting  
fouls,'' Thorn said. ``The players see that we're serious about 
what we're doing. All we ask of the refs is that they are 
consistent -- players always adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other rules seek to make illegal defense guidelines more  
understandable and set the shot clock at 14 seconds after fouls or 
out-of-bounds plays in the frontcourt, rather than the usual 24 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The referees were all in favor of the changes, although it has  
taken some time to gain consistency. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of them looked at this as a tremendous opportunity to be  
part of the solution,'' said Ed Rush, NBA director of officiating. 
``They haven't said to me that it's really tough. They are just 
adapting.''

<HEADLINE> Decision in Microsoft Trial Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The judge in the Microsoft Corp. antitrust  
trial delayed the first phase of his verdict for at least seven 
days on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Court officials announced last week that the judge's ``factual  
findings'' would be issued on an upcoming Friday at 6:30 p.m. in 
Washington, but they didn't indicate which Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Under rules adopted by the court, U.S. District Judge Thomas  
Penfield Jackson's office will notify government and company 
lawyers after the close of financial markets that a decision is 
about to be announced. But the lawyers won't know the outcome until 
it is publicly disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said a few copies of the findings will be available  
for the public and reporters at the courthouse, and electronic 
copies of the decision will be published by Microsoft and the 
Justice Department on their own Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, the court will post the findings on a Web site  
specially created for this purpose by the Government Printing 
Office, at http://usvms.gpo.gov.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nears Tax Break Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As Democrats drop their objections, Senate  
Republicans are preparing to push through an $8.5 billion extension 
of expiring tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters that  
Republicans agreed to support moving the so-called extenders bill 
through the Senate unanimously without any amendments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's got broad support,'' Lott said Thursday after a  
closed-door meeting of GOP senators. ``We want to do the 
extenders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Committee legislation would extend several business  
tax credits through Dec. 31, 2000, including the research and 
development credit that expired June 30. It would also ensure that 
millions of average taxpayers who claim numerous personal tax 
credits do not get tangled up in the alternative minimum tax in 
1999 and 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Although most Democrats also support the items in the measure,  
at least three were blocking it at midday. One of them, Sen. Bob 
Graham of Florida, announced in a Senate floor speech he would 
withdraw his ``hold'' because it is important to move the tax 
measure forward. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is appropriate to allow the Senate to take up this  
legislation without further delay,'' Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said he had objected because of an unrelated Medicare  
provider reimbursement measure that would spend $15 billion of the 
non-Social Security surplus. That is unlike the tax bill, which is 
fully offset with a variety of revenue raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to make the point that we're doing it right with  
the extenders bill,'' Graham said. ``I support that bill in large 
part because it's paid for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were optimistic they could overcome any other  
roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're pretty close to a consensus,'' said Sen. Don  
Nickles of Oklahoma, the Senate's second-ranking Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate measure is quite different from a five-year, $23.3  
billion bill pending in the House that would extend the research 
and development tax credit for five years and make the alternative 
minimum tax fix permanent. The two measures eventually would have 
to be reconciled before a final version is sent to President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in the mix is a Lott bill that blends parts of those two  
bills and omits others, while making the research and development 
credit permanent. That bill would cost $17 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite these differences, House Ways and Means Committee  
Chairman Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, was optimistic a deal would be 
worked out before Congress adjourns this year.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Recasner Seriously Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets guard Eldridge Recasner will  
miss at least the first six weeks of the NBA season with a broken 
shoulder and collapsed lung after an accident in forward Derrick 
Coleman's vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman was charged with driving while intoxicated after the  
collision with a grocery store delivery truck. 
</P>
<P>
	Recasner was in the passenger seat of Coleman's vehicle when  
Coleman apparently tried to make a left turn in front of the 
oncoming truck. The passenger side took the brunt of the impact. 
</P>
<P>
	No surgery is planned on Recasner's shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
	Coleman needed stitches to his nose and forehead but was  
released from a hospital early Wednesday. He missed practice 
Thursday with general soreness and swelling to his face, but could 
be ready for the season opener against Orlando Tuesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buy a can of bug spray and the chemical  
chlorpyrifos is likely to be in it. Spray the lawn for insects and 
it's there too. And it's on the flea collar around the cat's neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Found in more than 800 products, the pesticide is now under  
review by the Environmental Protection Agency, which in a 
preliminary risk assessment says it's so pervasive it potentially 
could pose health risks to people, especially children. 
</P>
<P>
	The assessment ``indicated that risks from the use of  
chlorpyrifos in residential settings, as well as its risk to 
applicators, are of concern,'' the EPA said in a statement Thursday 
after the agency put the preliminary assessment on its Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	By next summer, EPA officials will decide whether it will  
require additional restrictions by the manufacture -- such limiting 
its use or dosage -- or possibly ban the insecticide, which is sold 
under the trade names Dursban and Lorsban. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a preliminary risk assessment,'' EPA spokesperson Kim  
Ruby said. ``We're putting it out now for expert and public comment 
and it will go through a rigorous review process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While an environmental group pressed for the chemical's removal  
from the market, its producer, a subsidiary of Dow Chemical Co., 
argued that the preliminary EPA finding contained ``numerous errors 
and omissions'' that exaggerated the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Chlorpyrifos is one of 40 organophosphate pesticides under  
scrutiny as the EPA seeks to determine the health risks they pose, 
especially to children. The assessment stopped short of saying 
there was a clear public danger, although it said there was some 
evidence the chemical could affect the nervous system in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is one of the most widely used pesticides, with  
between 20 million and 24 million tons applied annually, according 
to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	Produced by Dow AgroSciences of Indianapolis, the pesticide can  
be found in everything from pet collars to insecticides applied to 
food crops, lawns and gardens. The chemical also is used to kill 
termites and indoors as a bug killer in hospitals, homes and 
daycare centers. 
</P>
<P>
	The products are so ``widely used by both homeowners and pest  
control operators and lawn care operators'' that ``the majority of 
the U.S. population is exposed to chlorpyrifos,'' the EPA review 
found. 
</P>
<P>
	A study of 993 adults found eight in 10 had ``measurable  
concentrations'' of the chemical in their urine. A study of 89 
children found nine of every 10 also with measurable 
concentrations, the review said. 
</P>
<P>
	Using data from the EPA assessment, Todd Hettenbach, a pesticide  
analyst for the Environmental Working Group, said people applying 
the insecticide on a variety of residential uses are exposed from 
two to 17 times the standard considered safe by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement by Dow AgroScience, which has made the chemical  
since 1965, said chlorpyrifos products ``have wide margins of 
safety'' if used according to label instructions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless these products are seriously misused their margins of  
safety are wide enough to protect both adults and children,'' the 
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said the EPA's preliminary assessment contained  
``numerous errors, and omissions of critical data which skew the 
assessment's findings and artificially inflate its estimates of 
risk.''

<HEADLINE> Boeing Finally Hands Over Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal safety investigators say they're  
dismayed the Boeing Co. would study fuel tank problems on its jumbo 
jets but then fail for years to disclose their findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Washington Post, in today's editions, quotes National Safety  
Transportation Board officials as saying the Boeing report could 
have helped them focus on the problem -- fuel tank overheating -- 
that was an apparent factor in the explosion of TWA Flight 800 over 
Long Island Sound in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Post, Boeing produced the report in 1980 but  
didn't give it to the NTSB until this June. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-volume report focused on a key issue that preoccupied  
TWA Flight 800 investigators -- excess heat from the air 
conditioning bay of its E-4B jet, the military version of its 747, 
possibly creating highly flammable fuel vapors in the plane's 
central fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement Friday, the NTSB expressed  
``displeasure'' and ``dismay'' about Boeing's delay. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Accounting Office, which conducts congressional  
probes, in recent months has been interviewing employees at Boeing 
and the Air Force, which commissioned the 1980 report. The Post 
quoted sources as saying the investigators have no evidence of an 
intentional cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing declined official comment. The Post quoted sources as  
saying company officials now concede they should have released the 
1980 report earlier but also contend it would not have affected the 
TWA Flight 800 probe. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was too important to fall through the cracks,'' Sen.  
Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the subcommittee that 
oversees airline disaster investigations, told the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley said the TWA 800 tragedy could have been prevented if  
Boeing had volunteered its report after a 1990 fuel tank explosion 
on different model Boeing jet, a Philippines Airline 737, at the 
Manila airport, killed eight people. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB said it did not learn of the 1980 report until last  
March, when it was listed on the agenda for a meeting of an Air 
Force task force studying the safety implications of the TWA Flight 
800 explosion for the E-4B. 
</P>
<P>
	A Boeing official was quoted by the Post as saying anonymously  
that the 1980 report was not directly related to the TWA Flight 800 
investigation because it focused on testing the temperatures of 
different fuels in different situations, whereas the NTSB probe 
instead focused on the ignition source of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	The NTSB is hoping to complete by next spring its report on the  
TWA Flight 800 explosion, which killed all 230 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Looks to French School Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rochelle Weisberger of North Potomac, Md.,  
feels lucky to be able to send her son, 5, and daughter, 3, to 
preschool, but she knows that many American families don't have the 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see a lot of people who don't give their children this  
start, quite honestly, because of price,'' said Weisberger, who is 
now trying to find full-day preschool for her daughter before she 
returns to work Monday as a software tester. ``My kids love it and 
they've learned so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But efforts to expand preschool programs have bogged down in  
debates over the quality of U.S. programs and the public 
responsibility to provide them. 
</P>
<P>
	In France, preschool is available to everyone; and if the United  
States is going to compete globally, it should expand its own 
preschool access, a group of education advocates said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	France pays the equivalent of $7 billion a year to send nearly  
all 3-to 5-year-olds to voluntary, all-day preschools that focus on 
learning and the arts. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States does spends about $11 billion on programs that  
are not mandatory and are targeted to poor families. Others can pay 
tuitions ranging from $1,200 to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept asking people how they came to this acceptance of  
preschool as a universal norm,'' said Allyson Schwartz, a state 
senator from Pennsylvania who joined a U.S. delegation that toured 
French preschools in January. ``It was so accepted there they 
couldn't remember. To them it was such as odd idea -- that we would 
question the need for families to have quality care and preschools 
for children. They thought we were the odd ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In America, 55 percent of families send children to preschool --  
either to Head Start programs for the poor or private schools 
affordable to better-off families. French attendance is near 100 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	States, which control the bulk of U.S. education policy, are  
just beginning to consider creating programs for all young 
children, regardless of income. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia, New York and Vermont have passed laws to create  
statewide preschools. New Jersey's prekindergarten program is part 
of its state funding law. 
</P>
<P>
	None of these schools are compulsory, as is first-grade  
nationwide and some kindergartens. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., who chairs the Senate Health,  
Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is proposing a $7 billion 
program to help states create tailored, voluntary preschool 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whereas Head Start is targeted to needy people, this would be  
available to everyone,'' said Joseph Karpinski, Jeffords' 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Even proponents concede that most states would not be willing to  
fund universal preschool. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is proposing we take the French system and start  
imposing it on the U.S. system,'' said California's state education 
chief, Delaine Eastin, who is a strong proponent of tailored 
preschools that would be open to all children. 
</P>
<P>
	The French system, she said, is national and stresses immersion  
in French culture over the cultures of immigrants; the United 
States can replicate the system's idea of universal access if not 
all of the content. 
</P>
<P>
	The report -- released by the French-American Foundation -- called  
on U.S. policy-makers to also follow the French example of 
promoting preschool programs, coordinating and clarifying federal 
and local responsibilities and giving teachers better training and 
pay. Israel, Sweden, Italy and other nations offer universal access 
to preschool, said Eastin. 
</P>
<P>
	Some critics worry the push for universal, high-quality  
educational preschool will put greater demands on underpaid, 
undertrained workers, or divert funds from children whose parents 
cannot afford private programs. Others call universal preschool 
anti-family or convenient day care for the affluent. And others 
question the research touting early childhood learning and the 
ability of public systems to handle more programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``To expand the public schools' responsibilities when they  
aren't meeting the goals we have already given them seems 
foolish,'' said Darcy Olsen, an analyst at the Cato Institute, a 
libertarian think tank in Washington. ``This is a false promise.''

<HEADLINE> Browns Sign Miller to 4-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEREA, Ohio (AP) -- Jamir Miller sees a time when the Cleveland  
Browns will be winners instead of winless. The Browns looked at 
Miller and saw the linebacker they want to anchor their defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The result was that Miller and the Browns agreed Friday to a  
four-year contract extension worth about $18.3 million, including 
$6 million in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 25, originally signed a one-year deal with Cleveland in  
May after five years with the Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	The pact means the expansion Browns can count on featuring  
Miller as they build their defense. While the unit has struggled as 
the team has gone 0-7, it also has kept the Browns in several games 
despite an offense averaging about seven points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has 69 tackles this season and has stood out as the  
team's defensive leader, although he will miss Sunday's game 
against New Orleans with a separated shoulder. He is hoping to 
return to the lineup for Cleveland's Nov. 7 game with Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Jamir signed with the Browns, it was an extension of  
faith on his part that he would take a shot on this new expansion 
organization,'' Browns president Carmen Policy said. ``This 
contract, Jamir, is intended to be a repayment of that trust you 
showed us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a first-round draft pick out of UCLA in 1994, came to  
Cleveland after turning down an offer from Arizona and attracting 
little interest on the free agent market, perhaps because of two 
previous violations of the league's substance abuse policy. He was 
suspended four games in 1995 after the second violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller bought a home for his family in Cleveland despite his  
one-year contract, figuring that if he flourished here, a long-term 
deal would follow. He was right. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just happy that they decided to build the defense around  
me,'' Miller said, flashing a big smile. ``It's cool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller's agent, Leigh Steinberg, said he and his client weren't  
overly concerned with the new Browns' slow start because they were 
impressed with coach Chris Palmer, Policy and the rest of the 
Browns front office. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to look beyond the short-term. We feel they have the  
building blocks to be a winner for years to come,'' Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Policy said that Miller's signing is a signal to the rest of the  
Browns players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a good sign as to how the Cleveland Browns feel  
about those players that take care of this organization,'' Policy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Potential free agents may also note that Miller is confident  
enough in the Browns to stay with them, he added. Miller said he 
would be glad to make recruiting calls to free agents in the 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why wouldn't I?'' he said. ``They take care of you here.''

<HEADLINE>  Pakistan Democracy's Return Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan's military ruler refused  
today to tell a visiting Commonwealth delegation when the country 
will return to democracy and turned down a request to see the 
deposed prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't give any timetable for a certain reason -- not for any  
malevolent intention, but the reason was I have set myself certain 
objectives and I am targeting those objectives,'' Musharraf told 
reporters following the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The army chief has resisted international pressure to detail  
plans for a return to civilian government. 
</P>
<P>
	Musharraf said today that he first wants to revive the ailing  
economy, clean up the country's corrupt politics and create an 
atmosphere for democracy to flourish before calling elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish there was a computer where I could feed all these  
objectives and the computer could give me a time frame, but since 
there is no such computer I cannot give a time frame,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference at the end of the two-day visit to  
Pakistan, the delegation leader, Canada's Foreign Minister Lloyd 
Axworthy, said the Commonwealth ``found no wish for another 
protracted period of military rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that Musharraf offered ``certain benchmarks of  
progress'' toward returning democracy to Pakistan, such as sweeping 
reforms of the electoral process and the creation of a truly 
independent election commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The representatives from the Commonwealth, which groups Britain  
and its former colonies, arrived in Pakistan on Thursday to press 
for a return to democracy and to see Sharif, who has been under 
military lockup since the Oct. 12 coup ousted his unpopular 
government. But Musharraf said such a visit was not possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he said Axworthy could talk with Sharif by telephone.  
Sources close to the delegation, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, said Axworthy waited an hour for the call but never 
received it. 
</P>
<P>
	Axworthy said the delegation was later told Sharif did not want  
to talk by phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharif has not been seen since the coup. He spoke to his family  
for the first time on Tuesday, when he reportedly told them he was 
in good health and being well treated, according to army Maj. 
Attiq-ur Rehman, who is guarding his home. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting with the Commonwealth delegation Thursday, members  
of Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League expressed concern about his 
safety but stopped short of condemning the army, according to 
people who attended the meeting but refused to be quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
	Both international and Pakistani human rights groups as well as  
the Pakistan Muslim League are demanding Sharif be allowed to see a 
lawyer, family and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pakistan, where the army has ruled for 25 of the nation's  
52-year history, few are anxious for quick elections. Frustrated by 
the endemic corruption of Pakistani politics, most seem ready to 
put elections aside at least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Axworthy said that for many the army takeover has been seen as  
``perhaps a turning point, a catalyst toward broadly based'' 
representative system. 
</P>
<P>
	Civilian members of the new military regime have told  
Commonwealth delegation members that their setup is not martial law 
because civil rights, press freedoms and the judiciary remain 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commonwealth has suspended Pakistan from participation on  
its advisory councils. It wants an immediate return to democracy 
but its rules allow up to two years for the army administration to 
achieve that goal. The rules also allow the Commonwealth to give 
technical assistance to the military regime toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
	The final decision on whether to expel Pakistan from the  
Commonwealth rests with the heads of states who will meet Nov. 
12-15 in Durban, South Africa. The delegation, which is winding up 
its two-day trip to Pakistan, will offer a recommendation.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Parents Respond to Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- An attorney for the parents of JonBenet Ramsey  
accused Colorado's governor of lying, saying his clients were 
rejected when they offered to cooperate in the investigation into 
their daughter's death. 
</P>
<P>
	L. Lin Wood, an Atlanta attorney for John and Patsy Ramsey,  
responded Thursday to comments made by Gov. Bill Owens. 
</P>
<P>
	The governor, in announcing he would not appoint a special  
prosecutor in the high-profile case, challenged the Ramseys to 
``quit hiding behind your attorneys, quit hiding behind your public 
relations firm and return to Colorado and work with us to find the 
killers in this case, no matter where that trail may lead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys accused the governor of slander. And Wood said there  
is ``no doubt Bill Owens lied in that press conference, when he 
stated that John and Patsy Ramsey have not cooperated with 
authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys were willing to meet with the governor and testify  
before a grand jury looking into the 1996 death, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every one of those offers has either been rejected or  
ignored,'' he said. He accused the governor of joining ``the ranks 
of the supermarket tabloids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens' spokeswoman confirmed Thursday that attorneys for the  
Ramseys did contact the governor's office and offered to make John 
Ramsey available for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor didn't think it was appropriate to meet with  
people who are considered suspects,'' spokeswoman Amy Sampson said. 
</P>
<P>
	JonBenet's body was found in her parents' Boulder home Dec. 26,  
1996. No suspects have been named and no arrests have been made. 
Boulder police have said the Ramseys remain under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens got involved in the case after Boulder District Attorney  
Alex Hunter announced Oct. 13 that the grand jury investigating 
JonBenet's death had ended its investigation without issuing any 
indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ramseys hired Wood, who represented wrongly accused Olympic  
bombing suspect Richard Jewell, before the grand jury completed its 
work.

<HEADLINE> Africa Trade Bill Fails in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today rejected an attempt to move  
ahead on a bill promoting trade with Africa and the Caribbean, 
apparently dooming it for the year despite a fresh appeal from 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate turned to other matters after Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss., failed to win the needed 60 votes to overcome 
delaying tactics by opponents and a barrage of amendments -- 
including some offered by the bill's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats opposed what they characterized as strong-arm tactics  
by Lott in trying to limit their ability to amend the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota protested  
what he called ``the level of complicity and the extraordinary 
encumbrances the majority demands of this body each and every day 
we legislate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a 46-45 vote, the Senate rejected Lott's efforts to limit the  
number of amendments that could be offered to the measure and to 
bring debate to a conclusion. The Senate had been debating the bill 
most of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to the measure came mainly from textile-state  
senators, who claimed the reductions of tariffs and quotas for 
African-made products would hurt the U.S. garment industry, and 
from some labor groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats voted as a bloc against the Lott's motion.  
</P>
<P>
	Proposed amendments ranged from a Democratic move to raise the  
$5.15 hourly minimum wage by $1 to an effort by Midwestern 
farm-state senators to ease agricultural sanctions on Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which has been considered for five years and  
passed twice by the House, would lower tariffs and quotas on 
products from the nations of sub-Saharan Africa. Sponsors had 
modified it to also include Caribbean and Central American nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who want to kill this bill have done a masterful job,''  
said Sen. William Roth, R-Del., chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee and a key sponsor of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the measure had been shunted aside -- even though  
it had the support of Clinton, Lott and Daschle. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, at a joint White House news conference with Nigerian  
President Olusegun Obasanjo, said Thursday it was ``vital that the 
Senate approve the African Growth and Opportunity Act, which is now 
pending.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to recognize that barriers to trade are barriers to  
opportunity for Africans working hard to catch up to the global 
economy and for Americans who want to work with them,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said the Senate's failure to pass the measure now would be  
``a major setback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is inexcusable for this legislation not to proceed,'' Roth  
said in a Senate speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate took up the African trade bill earlier in the week,  
but the legislation quickly got bogged down in partisan bickering. 
</P>
<P>
	For two years in a row, the House has passed the underlying  
legislation, designed to spur economic growth and private 
investment in 48 sub-Saharan countries. But it keeps stalling in 
the Senate because of unrelated issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth and other sponsors hoped to amend the measure to give the  
same trade preferences to Caribbean and Central American nations. 
Under Lott's policy, that amendment would be allowed because it is 
germane.

<HEADLINE> Golfers Flock to Orlando for Payne Crashed  </HEADLINE>

                           *AP Golf Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- With Paul Azinger rolling up his pants in  
makeshift knickers, Payne Stewart was eulogized today as a buoyant 
and gracious man with a passion for his family, faith and the game 
he played like a champion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a tear-filled memorial service at the First Baptist Church,  
his friends recalled Stewart's success on the golf course and how 
happy he was with his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart loved life,'' Azinger said in a moving tribute  
that also brought laughter at times. ``He was the life of every 
party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time U.S. Open champion was among six people killed  
Monday when his Learjet soared uncontrolled across the heartland 
until running out of fuel and crashing into a field in South 
Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	Before beginning his eulogy, Azinger put on a tam o'shanter cap  
and rolled up his trousers to reveal a pair of argyle socks -- 
similar to Stewart's trademark knickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger joked that only Stewart could get him to wear a suit.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt pressure this morning knowing he'd be watching,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The church was filled with photographs of Stewart -- on the golf  
course and with his family -- as well as some of his trophies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne Stewart was a vicious competitor. He only played to  
win,'' Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that Stewart's attitude had changed recently after  
finding his faith, adding: ``Only God can change hearts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Payne became gracious in victory and gracious in defeat,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Azinger broke into tears as he said, ``Goodbye, Payne. We loved  
you and we miss you, but we know we will see you again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's widow, Tracey, spoke of how she fell for him when she  
met him. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the night of our first date, I can honestly tell you this  
is the man I wanted to share the rest of my life with,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of his devotion to their son and daughter, actively  
involved in their budding interest in sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will always be my soulmate and my best friend. We love  
you. Let the party in heaven begin,'' she concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The PGA Tour had canceled play at the Tour Championship and the  
Southern Farm Bureau Classic so players could attend the service. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that we're taking the day off so we can go to the  
service,'' said Hal Sutton, the defending champion at the Tour 
Championship in Houston. ``He deserves his day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 29 players in the Tour Championship already experienced  
the powerful emotions of paying tribute to Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the first round began Thursday in Houston, players  
attended a brief but somber service on the first tee of Champions 
Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	After playing 27 holes, many of them boarded private planes for  
a one-day trip to Orlando to say goodbye to Stewart one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be very, very emotional for a lot of people,''  
said Davis Love III, whose father was killed in a plane crash 11 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Love and Tom Lehman were among those who thought about taking  
the entire week off until deciding it was best to be with their 
peers to start the grieving. After getting through a difficult day 
of golf in which the focus was far from birdies and bogeys, they 
will return to Houston on Saturday for another 27 holes. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility exists that some will be so shook up, they will  
not want to return to Houston to resume the Tour Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will see what the weekend brings,'' Love said. ``It's good  
for me to have a day off, but I don't know. You have to take each 
guy individually and see what they shot and how close they were to 
Payne.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the European PGA Tour, players planned to pause for a moment  
of silence on the 18th green following today's round at the Volvo 
Masters in Jerez, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart's impact on golf went far beyond his 18 victories around  
the world, including two U.S. Opens and a PGA Championship. He was 
a member of five Ryder Cup teams and showed a passion for the 
matches like few others. 
</P>
<P>
	PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem recalled one of the last  
conversations he had with Stewart, right after the United States 
stormed from behind to win the Ryder Cup in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he had eight years left on the PGA Tour and then was  
going to play a full Senior Tour schedule,'' Finchem said. ``He was 
fully together and understood exactly where he was. He was in a 
crystal ball and could see where he was going. And I was delighted 
to know those knickers were going to be out here for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clothes were but a small part of the Stewart legacy.  
</P>
<P>
	He had the kind of flamboyant personality to wear the  
traditional golf garb -- the knickers and tam o'shanter cap often 
wore by Ben Hogan. At times, Stewart would wear a tie during 
pro-ams, which is what Walter Hagen and other great players in the 
early 20th century wore. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was meticulous in the way he presented himself as a PGA  
Tour player,'' Finchem said. ``He felt so strongly about the 
importance to the presentation of our sport. He is in many ways 
irreplaceable from that perspective. He was a unique figure in 
sports and in golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For style alone, Finchem compared him to Hagen, ``a player who  
had this bigness, this presence about him, who dressed for the 
game, who brought excitement to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was a substance to Stewart, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	He was perhaps the most successful player in the U.S. Open, the  
toughest championship in golf, during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart won his first U.S. Open in 1991, beating Scott Simpson  
in an 18-hole playoff at Hazeltine in Minnesota. He also won in 
June at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, one of the most dramatic 
finishes in the 105-year history of the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
	He had two other close calls in the U.S. Open, losing by two  
strokes to Lee Janzen at Baltusrol in 1993 and again finishing 
second to Janzen at The Olympic Club in San Francisco a year ago, 
when he failed to hold a 4-stroke lead going into the final round. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry about me, boys,'' Stewart said at the time. ``I'll  
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He kept his word.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Urge Police Hiring Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite criticism from government auditors and  
from Republicans, President Clinton's plan to put as many as 
100,000 new police officers on the streets by next fall has been a 
success, Democrats say. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Anthony David Weiner, D-N.Y., and Rep. Debbie Stabenow,  
D-Mich., said it has been so successful they have introduced 
legislation that would authorize $1.15 billion a year through 2005 
for what the White House has called ``the logical successor'' to 
the program -- an effort to add 50,000 more new officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is needed because Republican critics succeeded in  
keeping any money for that new program out of budget bills now 
working their way through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``This program is making a difference and we would be foolish  
not to continue with its success,'' said Michigan Rep. David 
Bonior, the House's second-ranking Democrat, at a news conference 
Thursday just outside the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonior and fellow Democrats spoke shortly after Republicans on  
the House Judiciary Committee's crime subcommittee expressed 
reservations about the current Community Oriented Policing 
Services, or COPS program. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is no secret that the president has long made the COPS  
program a centerpiece of his crime agenda,'' said Rep. Bill 
McCollum, R-Fla., chairman of the subcommittee. ``I am convinced 
that if we took all of the COPS funding each year and turned it 
into flexible block grants for local governments to fight crime as 
they see fit, and distributed on the basis of crime rates, we would 
be doing more to actually reduce crime than the COPS program 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The COPS program, which expires Sept. 30, was included in a 1994  
crime law championed by the president. It authorized $8.8 billion 
for grants to state and local police agencies to hire new officers 
or redeploy existing ones into street work with the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say COPS has helped drive crime rates down, but  
Republicans have said the money would be put to better use if state 
and local police departments had more say in how it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report released in July, Justice Department auditors said  
the Clinton administration probably would fall 40,000 short of its 
goal of deploying 100,000 new officers by the end of this fiscal 
year. COPS officials then said they planned to have allocated 
enough money to fund 100,000 new officers by that deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	The report contained other criticisms, Republicans noted.  
</P>
<P>
	Allocation of the grants is not tied to a community's crime  
rate, McCollum said, and many communities could lose their new 
officers once their grants expire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost 60 percent of police agencies that have accepted the  
three-year COPS grants have not developed plans to retain officers 
once the federal funding dries up, as is ostensibly required to 
receive a grant,'' McCollum said. 
</P>
<P>
	COPS Director Thomas Frazier told the subcommittee that early  
recipients of the grants weren't required to have a retention plan, 
but the rules have been changed since then.

<HEADLINE> Bank Bali Report Implies Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Several Indonesian officials,  
including the head of the central bank and advisers to ex-President 
B.J. Habibie, should be investigated for possible links to a 
scandal at Bank Bali, an international audit recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, obtained by Dow Jones  
Newswires on Friday, says the equivalent of $80 million transferred 
out of Bank Bali to a company with ties to the former ruling Golkar 
Party made its way into dozens of domestic and foreign bank 
accounts. The accounts include those of former legislators and the 
party itself. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition figures have alleged that the transfer out of Bank  
Bali was intended to help finance Habibie's failed election 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal has derailed Indonesia's bank restructuring program  
and shaken investor confidence in the country. The government, 
under new President Adburrahman Wahid, has pledged to publish the 
audit and pursue the culprits. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has demanded that the government  
make the report public as a precondition to a resumption of its 
loan program, which was suspended when the scandal broke earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lengthy, detailed analysis of the circumstances leading to  
the transfer of funds out of Bank Bali on June 1, the report 
identifies the people who benefited from the original transfer of 
funds to PT Era Giat Prima, a company controlled by a senior Golkar 
official. 
</P>
<P>
	It recommends further investigation of more than 30 people,  
including central bank Gov. Sjahril Sabirin, A.A. Baramuli, a 
senior adviser to ex-President B.J. Habibie and head of the supreme 
advisory council, and Agus Sudono, another member of the council. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the information uncovered to date and the numerous  
indicators of potential fraud and corruption discussed above, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers recommends that the circumstances 
surrounding the potential involvement of (these) individuals be 
subject to further investigation,'' the audit firm said.

<HEADLINE> New Orleans Noise Law Struck Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Street musicians in New Orleans' rollicking  
French Quarter won the right to let the good times roll outside 
historic St. Louis Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge Wednesday struck down a state law establishing  
``quiet zones'' around churches and hospitals. The law would have 
muffled musicians playing in front of the Roman Catholic cathedral 
in Jackson Square. 
</P>
<P>
	``The church strong-armed the state Senate to pass this  
ridiculous law,'' said Scott Kirby, a jazz and ragtime pianist who 
plays in the square. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Sarah Vance declared the law an  
unconstitutional violation of free speech, saying it created 
criminal penalties for noise levels similar to normal conversation 
and passing automobile traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The regulation at issue applies to public streets and parks in  
New Orleans, the very heart of a city favored by citizens and 
tourists alike for a culture grounded in live music and outdoor 
celebration,'' Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office said it will appeal but had no  
further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, which took effect in August but was put on hold in  
September, made noise from bands, loudspeakers, boom boxes and 
street entertainers a criminal offense if it registers 55 decibels 
or more, as measured 10 feet from a church or hospital. Violators 
risked 30 days in jail and a $500 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Singers, piano players and other musicians sued.  
</P>
<P>
	Vance agreed with the performers on free-speech grounds but  
rejected their claim that the law improperly advances religion. 
</P>
<P>
	The law applied statewide, but was drafted specifically to  
address concerns by parishioners of St. Louis Cathedral and nearby 
residents.

	A city ordinance reached last year in a compromise with  
musicians calls for the cathedral to post signs when services are 
in progress, during which times it would be illegal in a buffer 
zone near the church to create noise registering more than 78 
decibels 50 feet from the source. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent Booth, a lawyer for the parishioners, said the ordinance  
didn't solve all the noise problems. He said the parishioners will 
probably ask the Legislature to draft a new, more enforceable law.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate passed pro-business tax-break  
extensions on Friday with bipartisan support. But House Democrats 
complained the GOP majority had killed other legislation including 
gun control and campaign finance overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Halloween weekend complaint, House Democratic leader Dick  
Gephardt said, ``The people who get the real treats are 
corporations and the wealthy, from lavish tax breaks to legislation 
that is killed on their demand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of budget negotiations that are continuing four weeks into the  
new fiscal year, he added, ``This is a pointless, endless 
process.'' Republicans countered that they believe the budget can 
be finished by Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, meanwhile, signed another temporary spending  
bill that will keep the government operating for a week while 
negotiations continue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Congress still can't pass a budget because they can't figure  
out what to do,'' the president said during a speech in 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	A slew of GOP leaders and committee chairmen responded to the  
Democrats' complaints with lists of legislative accomplishments 
this year, including a 4.8 percent pay raise for military 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Democrats may want to pretend these accomplishments don't  
exist,'' House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas said in a 
statement. ``Working men and women across America are seeing the 
benefits of a Republican Congress -- a strong economy, low inflation 
and modern technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the maneuvering is a fierce fight for control of the  
House in an election still a year away. Republicans now hold a 
222-211 majority, the party's slimmest since retaking control in 
1995 for the first time in four decades. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, by voice vote, the Senate passed an $8.5 billion bill  
that would extend a dozen expiring tax breaks to certain 
businesses. The House has yet to act on its version, which would 
cost nearly three times as much. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate version would extend several business tax credits  
through Dec. 31, 2000, including the research and development 
credit that expired June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Republican leaders said they thought the two sides  
could resolve their differences on the budget by Nov. 10, just 
before lawmakers leave town for Veterans Day. Following a private 
strategy session Friday between top White House officials and 
Gephardt, Democrats seemed less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly possible, but there are a lot of important  
issues to get through,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta 
said in a brief interview. ``We're interested in substance, not 
timing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agreements have yet to be worked out, for example, on Clinton's  
proposals for money to hire thousands of teachers and to purchase 
new parklands. But for all of the rhetoric, the budget differences 
between Clinton and the Republicans are relatively minor this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the five remaining spending bills that have been vetoed or  
face a veto threat, Clinton wants less than $5 billion more than 
the GOP has already provided. Many of the remaining fights are over 
who should control federal dollars, not over killing programs as in 
the first year of the GOP's congressional majority. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Republicans and Clinton had moved closer to an  
inevitable budget showdown when the House passed and sent to the 
Senate the last -- and largest -- spending bill of the year in the 
face of a certain veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've put our mark on it, he'll put his mark on it in the form  
of a veto, and that's when negotiations really start,'' House 
Appropriations Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., said Thursday 
after the House passed the huge bill to fund the District of 
Columbia and the health and labor departments. 
</P>
<P>
	The spending measure, approved on a near party-line 218-211  
vote, also carried a 0.97 percent across-the-board cut in federal 
agencies' budgets, which Clinton has said he would not accept. 
Senate passage was expected early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the last of the 13 spending bills needed to fund the  
government in fiscal 2000, which began Oct. 1. Congress already has 
passed and Clinton has signed two short-term measures that have 
kept the government running nearly a month into the new year.
