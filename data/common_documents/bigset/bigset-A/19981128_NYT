POPE EXPANDS RELIGIOUS INDULGENCES FOR MILLENNIUM OBSERVANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs grafs 3, 4 &AMP; 10 to clarify definition and use of
indulgences.)  (htv)

<P>
   ROME _ For Roman Catholics, the year 2000 offers early
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II announced Friday that in celebration of
entering the third millennium of Christianity, penitents who do a
charitable deed or give up cigarettes or alcohol for a day can earn
an ``indulgence'' to eliminate punishment on earth or in purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials emphasize that indulgences depend on sincere
repentance and are not a loophole for sinners. Still, some liberal
Catholics are embarrassed by a practice that seems to offer a
simplistic shortcut to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences are an ancient form of church-granted amnesty from
certain forms of punishment, in this life or hereafter, for sins.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval church sold indulgences, a practice that drove
Martin Luther to rebel, leading to the Reformation. They remain a
source of theological debate between Protestants and Catholics, and
since Vatican II, the Roman Catholic Church had played down their
importance.
</P>
<P>
   By restoring indulgences to so prominent a position, John Paul
II is making penitence a theme of the church's observance of the
millennium. He is also reassuring conservatives in the church.
</P>
<P>
   But by broadening the ways believers can earn an indulgence, he
is also trying to imbue indulgences with some of the ecumenical
spirit he wants to give the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   In a papal bull titled ``Incarnationis Mysterium'' (The Mystery
of the Incarnation) to be formally issued on Sunday, the pope
proclaimed 2000 a Holy Year, and put forth edicts that in many ways
serve as a practical guide for spiritual good works during the
Jubilee, or church anniversary. He decreed that the Jubilee would
begin on Christmas Day 1999 and end on the Feast of the Epiphany,
Jan. 6, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the papal document dealt with collective penitence.
Pope John Paul II asked Catholics to seek forgiveness for past
historical errors during the Jubilee. He also asked rich nations to
ease or substantially eliminate Third World debt.
</P>
<P>
   The pope said individual sinners can be granted ``plenary
indulgences,'' which remove the punishment for repented sins. In
Catholic theology, such indulgences eliminate the time in which
souls are cleansed in purgatory before entry into heaven. The
indulgences are not meant to save people if they commit grave sins
and do not repent, the church teaches.
</P>
<P>
   The pope included personal acts of penitence or charity work as
a way of earning an indulgence.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the millennial celebration, believers will be offered
a wider selection of ways to receive a plenary indulgence. They can
follow tradition and attend a Mass in one of several designated
churches and perform such devotions as the rosary or the stations
of the cross. Or, an appendix to the pope's letter says, they can
visit the sick, the imprisoned or the handicapped, or give to the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can choose an act of private sacrifice. The appendix,
signed by Cardinal William Baum, an American who is a top Vatican
official, explained: ``This would include abstaining for at least
one whole day from unnecessary consumption (e.g. from smoking, or
alcohol, or fasting.)''
</P>
<P>
   The text points out that sinners must also fulfill the ``usual
spiritual and sacramental conditions'' and say the ``usual
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Crescenzio Sepe, a top official in the Vatican's
Committee for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, said, ``One could
be tempted to think: `Today I won't smoke or I won't drink wine.
I'll get a plenary indulgence and go to paradise.' '' That, he
said, would be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would not be the spirit of an indulgence,'' he said.
``That would be off-beam, like returning to the thinking of the
Middle Ages.''
</P>
<P>
   Indulgences are not one-day expedients, Sepe said, but he did
not make light of brief sacrifices. ``Its not so easy for some to
give up smoking for a day,'' he said. ``It might be easier to visit
a prison inmate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The pope's decision to expand the use of indulgences during the
millennium celebration is not entirely surprising. In 1985, the
pope indicated his respect for the practice by allowing Catholics
to receive indulgences by television.
</P>
<P>
   Believers who followed on television or radio a church service
where an indulgence was granted could be included, as long as they
fulfilled the same conditions as those physically present,
including confession, communion and prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But indulgences, which began in early Christian times, have not
always been viewed favorably.
</P>
<P>
   In the 16th century, Pope Julius II offered indulgences in
exchange for contributions to build St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
Luther protested, and as his theological criticisms mounted, he was
excommunicated in 1521.
</P>
<P>
   The church later banned the sale of indulgences, but the Vatican
reaffirmed their religious importance at the Council of Trent in
1563. In 1968, Pope Paul VI also elaborated on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Including indulgences in the 2000 Jubilee ``could not be
avoided,'' said the Rev. Jared Wicks, a theologian at Gregorian
University in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative Catholics would find it intolerable that, for
ecumenical considerations, the church put into the closet a
practice affirmed by the Council of Trent,'' Wicks said, adding
with a laugh, ``And John Paul II is not one to do anything like
that.''

RED STORM LOSES LATE: TAR HEELS TAKE TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.Y.)  
 (EDS.: Subs throughout to recast piece and add analysis and
comments from players.)  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They noticed their layups rolling around the rim and
out, their execution becoming forced and shoddy, their defense
making little difference. Deep down, the St. John's players knew
what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   They did not want to know, but they did. It was obvious. They
had lost the momentum, and the game clock was now the enemy. The
less time left, the better, for they would not be able to hold off
hard-charging Purdue for long.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, 1.7 seconds less time would have been enough
because that was how much time was left when Purdue's Jaraan
Cornell pulled up from 19 feet and shot a high-arcing jumper that
bounced off the backboard and through the net. It gave the
14th-ranked Boilermakers a 70-69 come-from-behind victory Friday
night over No. 23 St. John's in the consolation game of the Chase
Preseason National Invitation Tournament at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   In the tournament's championship game, No. 9 North Carolina,
starting two freshmen and an inexperienced sophomore, held off No.
3 Stanford, 57-49. The Cardinal has five returning starters from
last season's Final Four team. Point guard Ed Cota, a junior,
scored a game-high 17 points to lead the Tar Heels.
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Storm, which led the consolation game by 16 points
with 13 minutes left, the heartbreaking loss came just two nights
after it blew a 10-point second-half lead in losing, 55-53, to
Stanford in Wednesday's semifinal round. The similarities in the
games seemed eerie, not just after Friday night's game but during
it.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Red Storm had felt the game slipping through
its fingers, the shooting guard Bootsy Thornton replied: ``In a
sense, yeah. I didn't want it to happen, but we kept telling
ourselves, `The game's not over.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who scored 18 points, was tough on himself afterward
because he missed the first shot in a one-and-one free-throw
situation with 10.6 seconds left and the Red Storm ahead by 69-68.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about going through my routine, bending my
knees and making the free throws,'' Thornton said. ``If I'm put in
that situation again, I'm pretty sure it won't happen again. But
right now, it's an indescribable feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thornton should not bare the brunt of this loss, for the
game should have never been that close. St. John's (3-2), looking
far superior to the Boilermakers (5-1), dominated the first half,
forcing 15 turnovers with its aggressive full-court press and
building a 41-25 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
   But even though it led by 56-40 with 13 minutes 1 second left,
something was different. Purdue had adjusted to the Red Storm's
trapping defense and was beginning to play with more confidence.
The Boilermakers' defense was starting to cause St. John's trouble,
and Purdue's shots were beginning to fall.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue kept closing, and when Cornell made the Boilermakers'
fourth 3-pointer of the second half, it cut St. John's lead to
56-52 with 8:17 left. St. John's built the lead back to 67-61, on a
layup by Ron Artest, who led all scorers with 20 points, but Purdue
scored the next 4 points and pulled to within 2 on a layup by Greg
McQuay (19 points).
</P>
<P>
   Then, in a perfect example of the lack of execution that cost it
the game, the Red Storm committed a shot-clock violation. Still, it
looked as if St. John's would survive when Lavor Postell scored a
driving layup to make it 69-65 with 16 seconds left. But Alan
Eldridge sank a contested 3-pointer, his second in the final four
minutes, to pull the Boilermakers to within a point. That's when
Purdue sent Thornton to the line.
</P>
<P>
   When he missed, Cornell sprinted toward the left wing, received
the pass and put up the game-winner with guard Erick Barkley (9
points, 6 assists) in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I released it and saw how high the arc was, I called
bank,'' Cornell said, joking.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had one final chance, but Artest's 3-point attempt at
the buzzer was short.

EARLY BIRDS UP AT CRACK OF DAWN TO GRAB HOLIDAY BARGAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Arriving at the suburban Glendale Galleria at
5:30 a.m., Gloria Mungaray gave herself a pat on the back for
beating the crowds on the first day of the holiday shopping season.
</P>
<P>
   Well, she thought she beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Approaching K-B Toys with a few family members Friday, the Los
Angeles resident saw to her horror that her group had been outrun
by hundreds of other people who were already lined up for the
store's 6 a.m. ``door buster'' sale.
</P>
<P>
   And this crack-of-dawn arrival wasn't even her idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``My niece is the one who coerced us into doing this,'' Mungaray
said about two hours later, as she dragged a big plastic bag so
stuffed with toys that it was starting to rip.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the day after Thanksgiving, the day that
traditionally marks the first day of the holiday shopping season.
And after several years of singing the holiday blues, merchants
could well be whistling a cheerier tune this year.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the crowds and cash registers at the Glendale Galleria
on Friday, Southern California's shopping season has gotten off to
a good start, said Richard Giss, a partner in the trade retail
services group at the accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP.
</P>
<P>
   The Glendale Galleria is a good mall from which to gauge general
shopping trends across the area in part because it is a regional
mall, drawing shoppers from a wide area, Giss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic right now is much heavier than last year at this
time,'' he said, scanning the bag-laden crowds surging through the
aisles at 9:45 a.m. While some stores opened as early as 6, most of
the mall opened at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden resurgence on Wall Street and a pickup in consumer
confidence were ``the last pieces that needed to fall into place''
to make this what promises to be an exceptional season, Giss said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of Friday's bag carriers appeared to have taken
advantage of the early-bird specials offered by K-B Toys and the
J.C. Penney and Mervyn's department stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this time of the day you've got quite a few bags, and you
expect it early on,'' Giss said.
</P>
<P>
   Galleria spokeswoman Annette Bethers said about 250 people lined
up in front of K-B Toys before its 6 a.m. opening, about 300 were
at Mervyn's for the store's 7 a.m. door-buster, and 200 people
arrived at the mall's Disney Store before its 8 a.m. opening to
snap up the limited-edition mini-beanbag plush toys available
Friday only.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the number of cars in the parking lot, plus some
``eyeballing'' of the crowds, mall management estimated a 10
percent to 15 percent increase in morning shopping traffic compared
with the same time last year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, by about 10 a.m. some 75 percent of the mall's
6,300 parking spaces were filled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems it's starting out stronger than it did last year,''
Bethers said.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney manager David Small said the store had ``the biggest
(opening crowd) in the last three years'' when it opened at 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first two hours, in dollars, I'm 67 percent ahead of
where we were the last two straight years,'' Small said.
</P>
<P>
   The line didn't appear to have diminished outside K-B Toys as
the clock ticked toward 11 a.m., forming what looked from above
like a huge question mark curving from the door and then down the
mall's center aisle.
</P>
<P>
   Another, longer line inside started directly in front of the
checkout stand and snaked through several aisles before veering
back toward the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, other shoppers jostled through the crowds, hauling
their toy-filled bags and generally trying to stay off each other's
toes.
</P>
<P>
   K-B store manager George Temourian managed the traffic like,
well, a traffic cop.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that thousands of people had gone through the store
in the morning. ``I couldn't even guess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The store's 250 Furbies, those mechanical gremlins with saucer
eyes, went fast. ``They were spoken for before 6 o'clock; we gave
out numbers,'' Temourian said.
</P>
<P>
   So what are the year's hottest items? Besides Furbies and the
ubiquitous Barbie, consumer electronics like Palm Pilots and family
band radios will be big, Giss said.
</P>
<P>
   And this could be the year of the DVD player as well. ``It's
been around, but it finally has some software you can use with it,
and the prices have come down,'' Giss said.
</P>
<P>
   Big-ticket items like jewelry and furniture could also prove
more popular with shoppers this year. ``That's because people have
money to spend,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One Furby buyer was Mary Fowler of Hollywood, who had four of
the critters in her bags -- two of them hers, two her sister's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to see them -- I had a backup at another store
in case I didn't get them,'' she said as she took a breather from
shopping. ``I was going to get them one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Within her first hour or so of shopping she had spent about
$300, about half the $600 or so she expects to spend this season --
which is less than she spent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to cut back on the impulse buying,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   (2ND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Susie Valle was quite pleased at having successfully
dragged aunt Gloria Mungaray and the others to the mall so early.
After all, they caught all the best deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found everything I came for at this store, according to the
ad. I went through the ad and made a list,'' said the suburban
Eagle Rock resident, who dragged several bags loaded with $183
worth of toys around the mall.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same story elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's early door busters gave Kathy Suyemoto of suburban
Newhall time to hit Toys `R' Us and Wal-Mart before landing at the
Valencia Town Center a few miles away. She declared victory at
11:15 a.m., leaving that mall's K-B with five huge sacks of toys
for the 14 kids on her Christmas list. Her receipt read $189 and
some change.
</P>
<P>
   Her best find was three California Roller Girls dolls, regularly
$40, for $7.99 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got up at a quarter to 6, threw on some sweats and here I
am,'' Suyemoto said. ``There were people in line waiting to get
into the store. Then there was a huge line at the cash register.
People kept saying, I'm not going to wait, I'm not going to wait --
but then you kept getting a little bit closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Others didn't want to get up so early. Mark Davis, 32, of
suburban Lancaster, arrived at the Antelope Valley Mall at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to get a jump on Christmas. I also have to do some
birthday shopping,'' Davis said. ``I was away on business. Now I'm
trying to do a lot of catch-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some came just to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to watch people fight over clothes and
toys,'' said R.J. Gangloff of Malibu as he people-watched at The
Oaks mall in suburban Thousand Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   But most people were shopping, not watching.
</P>
<P>
   With a cellular phone to one ear, Tamberley Much of suburban
Brentwood paced impatiently on a sidewalk at the Camarillo Premium
Outlets shopping center in Camarillo, in neighboring Ventura
County. Already dressed for the holidays in a candy-cane sweater,
she was eager to embark on a cherished family activity: going
shopping the day after Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tradition,'' said Much, whose mother showed up at her
doorstep at 8 a.m. to go shopping. ``Every day after Thanksgiving
we get up early to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   She will spend more money this year because there are more
family members. Her mother, Belinda Earl of Glendale, also expects
to shell out more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy's better,'' she said. ``It's easier to spend
more.''
</P>
<P>
   At midmorning, throngs of shoppers packed the sidewalks and
stores of the outlet center. The most popular retailers were
housewares such as Mikasa and Le Gourmet Chef. Also drawing big
crowds were stores with the deepest sales: Cole Haan was mobbed
because of discounts up to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do think we'll have a good year, better than last year,''
said Terri Cameron, general manager of Camarillo Premium Outlets.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., the main checkout lines at Wal-Mart in the Panorama
Mall in suburban Panorama City snaked past the candy-bar and
chewing-gum displays, through women's wear and next to kitchen
goods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wasn't thinking,'' said Eleanor Snyder, a San Diego
resident who returned to her hometown of North Hollywood for
Thanksgiving, and now stood with easily a dozen people before and
behind her. ``I was a retail manager for 15 years, and I told
myself I'd never do this. But I saw a good sale, and my kid needed
jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   With waits at the cash registers of the nation's only two-story
Wal-Mart running 15 minutes or more, post-holiday tempers wore
thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you spell a scream? Aahhh!'' said Armando Rodriguez, after
what he said was 10 minutes spent simply wading from one side of
the store to the other before getting in line. ``No way I'm doing
this again.''

BARGAIN STALLION PROVES GOLDEN AT CUTTING HORSE OPENING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ A stallion once rejected by a well-known
trainer and then purchased for a bargain price turned in the
highest opening-day score at the 1998 NCHA World Championship
Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   Chula Dual, ridden by Jon Burgess, a low-profile trainer from
Stephenville, turned in a first go-round tally of 222 as the
National Cutting Horse Association's premier show began its 17-day
run yesterday at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   That's an unusually high marking for a debuting 3-year-old
horse, especially when the Chula Dual only cost its owners, Harry
and Kathy Brinkerhoff of Stephenville, about $7,500 at a sale last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Burgess said the colt was auctioned after Joe Heim, a former
Futurity champion who was training Chula Dual at the time, declared
that the horse did not have potential. That caused then owner Billy
Emerson of Dallas to sell the horse at a Fort Worth sale last July,
Burgess said.
</P>
<P>
   After the Brinkerhoffs purchased Chula Dual and turned the
stallion over to Burgess, Chula Dual began to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the horse for only two weeks and he was doing some very
awesome things,'' Burgess said. ``I kept asking Harry, `Why did
\REmerson\S sell this horse?''
</P>
<P>
   Though the horse appears to be a blue-chipper, Harry Brinkerhoff
said it was a gamble when he purchased Chula Dual in July of 1997.
Brinkerhoff said Emerson watched Chula Dual in a practice session
two months ago, and Emerson said he regretted that he let the
stallion slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a roll of the dice,'' Brinkerhoff said. ``He could have
gone the other direction. In fact, I have another horse that I
bought at the same sale that is standing right here \Rat
Brinkerhoff's ranch\S because he did not make the Futurity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chula Dual, sired by the prominent stallion Dual Pep, lived
up to his billing and was entered in the Futurity, the show that
features the sport's most promising 3-year-old horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just like his daddy,'' Burgess said. ``He's a smart
sucker. He's got all of the pieces. He's smart, quick and has a lot
of cow sense and ability. He's got all of the elements to compete
with the big boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Burgess, 30, who has been a pro trainer for the past five years
and began riding cutters 21 years ago, said Chula Dual could be his
big break.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best horse that I've ever ridden, bar none,''
Burgess said. ``Even his bad days are good.''

CALIFORNIA MAY HAVE 50 MILLION RESIDENTS BY 2025, CENSUS BUREAU
SAYS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- California will grow faster and by greater
numbers than any other state between now and 2025, taking the top
spot from Nevada, according to a new U.S. Census Bureau projection.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada was one of the fastest-growing states throughout the
1980s, along with Arizona and Alaska, and it was the
fastest-growing state for most of the 1990s. But California's high
birth and immigration rates are expected to push its population
from roughly 32 million residents to about 50 million during the
next 27 years, a growth rate of 56 percent, the Census Bureau
report shows.
</P>
<P>
   California, the most populous state with 31.6 million people in
1995, was home to 12 percent of the U.S. population. By 2025, the
report predicts, it will account for 15 percent of the nation's
population.
</P>
<P>
   Of all metropolitan areas, Los Angeles, Riverside and Orange
counties together had the largest population increase in the
country between 1990 and 1996, adding 963,625 residents. Las Vegas
was the fastest-growing region, and the Los Angeles area was not
among the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   California's rapid growth is certain to be a boon for the
state's economy but could lead to more crowding in schools, a
shortage of housing, more traffic and shortages of water, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a horrendous challenge,'' said Jack Kyser,
chief economist for the nonprofit Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp. ``Right now everybody is enjoying the good
economic times. People just don't want to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   A key to California's growth is immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and 2025, ``California is expected to attract more
than one-third of the country's immigrants,'' the Census Bureau
report states. The state has had a net gain of more than 260,000
immigrants a year in the 1990s, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Morrison, a demographer for Rand, said that by his
calculations ``there is one new Californian every minute.''
</P>
<P>
   California was among the fastest-growing states in the 1960s
after countless veterans since World War II who had passed through
on duty returned to live, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   That has since changed, with the emphasis on international
immigration. ``We're attracting more people from around the world
than from other states,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, the number of people moving to California from other
states has exceeded people leaving for other states by about
20,000, reversing a trend caused by the recession of the early
1990s, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   If that continues and the economy remains strong, domestic
migration to California should eclipse the number of people leaving
by hundreds of thousands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Births also are driving up the population. Morrison said annual
births lately have outnumbered deaths by about 545,000 to 230,000.
</P>
<P>
   During the '90s, most of the population growth in California was
due to a higher birthrate than death rate, said James Allen, a
professor of geography at California State University, Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   This is good news for business, particularly because many in the
new population will be highly educated and skilled, will earn good
salaries and will spend the money in California, Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   But also as a result of the growth, the state faces serious
issues in everything from housing and schools to traffic and
landfills, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Political and business leaders need to take note, and soon,
Kyser said. ``The bad news is we're already behind the curve,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Where are all the millions of new Californians going to go?
Morrison said they are likely to flock to two places: the Inland
Empire of San Bernardino and Riverside counties and the rapidly
urbanizing Central Valley from Bakersfield to Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the residential and economic growth will be outside
Los Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As residential growth spreads away from Los Angeles, jobs locate
closer to where people are moving, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Los Angeles County as well, construction of new housing
may not keep pace with demand, said Kyser. There isn't much land
for new tracts, he said. And since the state in the early 1990s
shifted property tax revenues from cities and counties to schools,
municipalities have seen homes as a tax drain rather than a supply
of fresh revenue, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Houses may end up getting built with smaller front and back
yards, with no side yards separating them from the houses on either
side, Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, the CSUN geography professor, said some urban planners
are pushing for development of higher-density housing in Southern
California ``so we're not spreading out all over our countryside.''
</P>
<P>
   But Morrison said families tend to want their own homes and
yards.
</P>
<P>
   No matter where the new Californians live, they will still need
to drive in this automobile-dependent region. One solution to the
snail's pace of traffic this would cause may be the construction of
more privately financed toll roads, like those that have opened
recently in Orange County, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Education will also be a problem, he said, adding, ``It's a lot
easier to educate the child of an ex-New Yorker'' than of a recent
Mexican immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   Businesspeople believe the state will have to find a way to
educate the immigrants' children well, Morrison said, ``or you've
got the making of an underclass.''
</P>
<P>
   He is optimistic that the private sector will rise to the
occasion as the population rises, finding innovative solutions to
the problems the increase will spark. But he's not as confident
about the state's public officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm less optimistic about the political side doing the
economically smart thing,'' Morrison said.

BUS PLUNGES OFF BRIDGE AFTER ATTACKER SHOOTS DRIVER, SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVEN GOLDSMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Metro bus plunged off the Aurora Bridge Friday after one of
its passengers shot the driver and killed himself, police sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacular mid-afternoon crash injured 33 riders, filling
seven hospital emergency rooms. Amid the wreckage the driver and
his assailant lay dead, both with gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was like an action movie come horrifyingly to life, as
the downtown-bound Route 359 Express swerved through oncoming
traffic, crashed through a guardrail and struck the roof of an
apartment building before landing in the crowded Fremont
neighborhood more than 40 feet below.
</P>
<P>
   The fall split the 40,000-pound, articulated bus into a V,
sending its front half onto the steps of the two-story apartment
building and its rear half into the yard.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the worst tragedy in Metro Transit's nearly three
decades, dozens of paramedics and firefighters pulled bleeding
riders from the shattered bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a training exercise,'' paramedic Chris Cornett
said, ``with all the dirt on the injured faces.''
</P>
<P>
   The 44-year-old driver, Mark McLaughlin, died at the scene, the
victim of an apparent murder-suicide. Authorities said his body was
found on the roof of the apartment where he'd been ejected before
his bus slid off onto the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The man believed to be his attacker also was found near the bus
with a gunshot wound in his head and a fired gun nearby,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   He was pronounced dead at Harborview Medical Center, where
police reportedly recovered a second firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Transit officials said the incident happened so quickly
that McLaughlin, the driver, didn't even have time to push his
emergency alarm button.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon bus run had started routinely enough. On one of
the year's busiest shopping days, McLaughlin pulled his bus out of
the Aurora Village mall about 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13 minutes later, he reached the girdered Aurora Bridge two
miles north of downtown, driving in the middle of its three
southbound lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, according to Rick Walsh, director of King County's
Metro Transit division, came without warning from ``someone sitting
across the aisle from the driver in the first seat behind the
(front) door.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no previous conversation,'' Walsh said. ``No tension
was apparent and ..(he) pulled out a gun and shot the driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lee, 16, of Seattle, had caught the bus at North 85th
Street and Aurora Avenue North. She was sitting in the middle, near
the flexible joint, when ``I heard two gunshots and the bus
swerved.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus continued southbound about 100 feet, authorities said,
then swerved toward oncoming traffic where it clipped a northbound
Ford Econoline van driven by Tom Foti for Seattle Tile Co.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said she didn't realize the bus had run off of the bridge
until after it had hit bottom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I know there were people falling over each
other and there were people screaming and seats were breaking,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know we were in the air. I thought it was a big
accident and we had hit a semi (truck) or something.''
</P>
<P>
   She lost one of her shoes as she was tossed around inside the
bus. When the wreckage stopped moving, she was clinging to a metal
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy Olsen, 13, was on her way downtown to get her eyebrow
pierced. She was sitting in the middle of the bus when ``I saw two
flashes and heard a loud pop-pop. I saw the bus driver and his
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus then went out of control. ``It like happened in 30
seconds. Everybody was screaming and crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Olsen said she didn't see anything before the shooting to
indicate there was a problem between the driver and assailant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear them exchange any words.''
</P>
<P>
   When the bus hit the ground ``the floorboard flew up. I got
kinda jammed up underneath,'' she said, as she was about to be
treated at Ballard Swedish Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Jurgi, 52, was standing on the porch of her house on North
36th Street, about 100 feet away, when she saw the bus go off the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in such of swirl of metal and glass,'' she said. ``I
have never seen anything go over the bridge. I couldn't believe it.
It was like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   When it crashed to the ground, ``I heard a couple of voices
saying `Help me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, more than 20 rescue units were at the scene,
some rescuers trying to lift the bus to look beneath it for
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Chris and Auli Brown heard the bus crash through the rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of crying and moaning,'' said Chris Brown.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 injured people were strewn around the bus, mostly
within 10 feet of the wreckage. Many of them were bleeding from
head injuries. Some were conscious, others were not.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he saw only a few people still inside the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy was trapped under the front of the bus,'' he said, and
about five bystanders were trying to comfort him.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was half-in and half-out of the bus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Her torso lay on the floor, and her legs were hanging out of the
bus' ripped-open side.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of guys pulled her out and put her on the ground.''
She was crying hysterically, and tried to get up. But one of the
men held her until medical help arrived. ``I think she was OK,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He gave his jacket to a man named Henry, who had a broken leg.
He helped the man to the ground from his perch leaning against one
of the bridge supports. He watched as a doctor slit open the man's
pant leg to show the bone sticking out of his leg. When a medical
team put it in a splint, the man yelled in pain.
</P>
<P>
   The bus' fall sheared off part of the roof of the apartment
building at 905 N. 36th St., just west of Winslow Place North.
</P>
<P>
   There, post-Thanksgiving socializing turned to horror as Paul
Lauren, a 35-year-old crabboat fisherman, tried to help victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard moans and screaming,'' Lauren said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never ever seen anything like this in my life. It was
like the wreckage of an airplane crash. People were twisted like
dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident scene was littered with shredded medal, concrete,
blood, and shattered glass. The area also smelled of diesel fuel,
one witness said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren just got back from fishing in the Aleutians two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was dangerous up there. We always were worried
about getting killed. Now we're standing in the front of the house
and a bus falls on us. It's a real question of what's more
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they will not move the 72-passenger bus until
Saturday. They need heavier equipment and need to do it in the
daylight. Meanwhile, the site was being treated as a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Birt, assistant chief of northern fire operations, called
the accident ``a once in a lifetime incident. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a disaster drill, but it was for real,'' he
said. ``Everyone did everything by the book. Just right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I drive across this bridge all the time,'' Birt added,
pointing to the bridge above him, ``and often wonder how strong
those railings really are. Now we know they're not strong enough to
stop a bus.''
</P>
<P>
   An off-duty Metro driver, Ron Dunn, showed up at the scene. He
was in tears, shaken. He complained that Metro had not been
enforcing rules when it comes to unruly passengers, not cracking
down on passengers who were drinking or not paying fares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metro has gone overly liberal,'' he said. ``Drivers are going
to be very outraged by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said Metro officials will talk to drivers about their
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``From everything I have heard. ... it would have made no
difference even if a police officer was sitting next to the driver.
No words were exchanged before he shot the driver,'' Walsh said.
``This is one of those unpredictable things.''
</P>
<P>
   King County Executive Ron Sims said the county emergency
response system, including Medic One, was a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest test we've had. It worked really well,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, ``we're worried about the bus drivers. They
realize how vulnerable they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims said there would have been no way to prevent the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't have metal detectors on every single bus,'' Sims told
reporters outside the emergency room at Harborview. ``It's
virtually impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sims said this incident must be put in perspective given
that buses transport 84 million passengers annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean our buses aren't safe,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last one (fatal shooting on bus) happened 25 years ago.
This was just very, very unfortunate.''

YOUTHFUL NORTH CAROLINA OUTPLAYS NO. 3 STANFORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C.)  (js) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The young North Carolina Tar Heels are maturing quickly. Six
victims in six games, most notably the highly regarded Stanford
Cardinal, will attest to that.
</P>
<P>
   With two freshmen and an inexperienced sophomore in its starting
lineup, North Carolina defeated Stanford, 57-49, Friday night to
win its first Chase Preseason National Invitation Tournament
championship before 13,471 fans at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels' victory will shake up the national rankings, as
North Carolina entered the game rated ninth in the Associated Press
poll. Stanford, which has five returning starters and is viewed by
many as the country's top team, was ranked third.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were supposed to be at different stages _ Stanford
loading up for a run at the national title, while North Carolina is
trying to find an identity _ but those roles may be reversed after
this tournament. Although they stumbled at times, the Tar Heels
played with poise in defeating No. 14 Purdue in the semifinals and
Stanford (4-1) Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, on the other hand, struggled just to get to the
championship, edging St. John's by 55-53 on Wednesday. Their lack
of quickness in the frontcourt and absence of an explosive scorer
proved to be problems in both games.
</P>
<P>
   While North Carolina's youngsters played well, it was Coach Bill
Guthridge's leaders, the junior point guard Ed Cota and the senior
forward Ademola Okulaja, who led them to victory. Cota, who grew up
in Brooklyn, recorded game highs of 17 points and 11 rebounds and
made four free throws in the final 1 minute 22 seconds to seal the
victory after Stanford had pulled to within 46-43. Cota was named
the tournament's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Okulaja followed with 14 points. Brendan Haywood, North
Carolina's sophomore center, blocked 6 shots.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time this tournament, Stanford found itself
trailing at the half. A victim of North Carolina's torrid
first-half shooting (13 for 18), the Cardinal, which trailed St.
John's by 25-22 in Wednesday's semifinal, began the second half
Friday trailing by 32-23.
</P>
<P>
   But in a performance similar to the one against St. John's,
Stanford was stronger after intermission. Outplaying the Tar Heels
early in the second half, the Cardinal pulled to within 34-29, but
watched North Carolina score 4 straight points to push the lead
back to 9.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford had led early in the game _ very early. The Cardinal
scored the game's first basket, but then the Tar Heels, getting
3-pointers from Okulaja and Cota, ran off 10 straight points to
take command. The big and physical Cardinal battled back by
pounding the offensive boards. Stanford's rebounding _ the Cardinal
players grabbed nine of their missed shots for second opportunities
_ enabled them to overcome 27 percent shooting overall, including 3
of 11 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the half, Stanford picked up its defensive
intensity, making four steals, to turn a 14-7 deficit into a 19-17
lead when the reserve Ryan Mendez hit a 3-pointer. North Carolina,
behind 4 points from Cota and a 3-pointer by the freshman Jason
Capel, ended the half with a 15-4 run to take a 9-point lead into
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   In the consolation game, Purdue beat St. John's, 70-69, on a
basket by Jaraan Cornell with 1.7 seconds left, a high-arcing
jumper from 19 feet that bounced off the backboard and through the
net.
</P>
<P>
   For the Red Storm, which led by 16 points with 13 minutes
remaining, the heartbreaking loss came just two nights after it
blew a 10-point second-half lead in losing by 2 points to Stanford
in Wednesday's semifinals. For something so similar to happen in
the consolation game seemed eerie, not just after the game but
during it.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Red Storm had felt the game slipping through
its fingers, the shooting guard Bootsy Thornton replied: ``In a
sense, yeah. I didn't want it to happen, but we kept telling
ourselves, `The game's not over.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Thornton, who played a strong game in scoring 18 points, was
tough on himself afterward because he missed the first shot in a
one-and-one free-throw situation with 10.6 seconds left and the Red
Storm ahead by 69-68.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about going through my routine, bending my
knees and making the free throws,'' Thornton said. ``If I'm put in
that situation again, I'm pretty sure it won't happen again. But
right now, it's an indescribable feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thornton should not bare the brunt of this loss, for the
game should have never been that close. St. John's (3-2), looking
far superior to the Boilermakers (5-1), dominated the first half,
forcing 15 turnovers with its aggressive full-court press and
building a 41-25 lead at the break. &QL;

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bus 359 rolled onto the Aurora Bridge Friday, bound
for the Christmas lights and the holiday bustle of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Behind driver Mark McLaughlin sat a big man in his 40s. He sat
on the right. He carried a bag.
</P>
<P>
   The passenger said nothing. He just started firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just sitting there on the bus,'' one dazed passenger
said later as he waited for an ambulance to take him to a hospital.
He was identified only by the number paramedics had pinned to his
shirt: No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I heard this, `Pow! Pow! Pow!'''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Lee, who had caught the bus at North 85th Street and
Aurora Avenue North, thought she had heard two gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus swerved,'' the 16-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-foot bus veered into the northbound lanes of the bridge
and right at Tom Foti, 50 who was driving a van in the middle lane.
``He hit me in the side and spinned me around,'' Foti said. ``I was
trying not to hit other cars.''
</P>
<P>
   On the bus, Passenger 17 felt the 40,000-pound bus lurch off the
bridge. ``I just covered my head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 feet below was the Fremont neighborhood. Abrahim
Faraj was working on his truck. P.J. Mercouriadis was in the
library of her house, in the neighborhood where she has lived most
of her life. Clare Mercy was about to go outside to join some
friends in the rare November sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there came the sound of metal grinding against metal and
concrete, as Bus 359 slammed into the bridge's guardrail. The bus
ripped through a 25-foot section of the rail and barreled into a
light standard, bending it at a right angle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing I know there were people falling over each
other, and there were people screaming, and seats were breaking,''
Lee, the passenger, said. ``I didn't know we were in the air. I
thought it was a big accident, and we had hit a semi or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Concrete showered down. The articulated bus ricocheted off an
apartment building, then landed in a V-formation in the building's
garden, wrapped around a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounded like an explosion _ a first one, then a second
one,'' said Faraj, 57, who was three blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a weird crunching sound. It was metal,'' said
Mercouriadis, 62, who lives at North 38th Street and Linden Avenue
North.
</P>
<P>
   From her first-floor apartment under the bridge, Mercy, 29,
watched the bus tumble practically into her front yard and almost
on top of four friends waiting outside for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the bus fall. I heard the first noise. It was a huge
noise. It was a huge bang. It must have been the bus going through
the guardrail.''
</P>
<P>
   Sara Krause, 20, watched as the concrete fell down. One chunk
grazed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked up,'' she said, ``and this bus was, like, flying.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the street, the truck repairs and the rest of the idle
work of a four-day weekend ended. The work of saving lives started.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Kerr ran from his house near the famed Fremont troll when
he heard what sounded like ``four or five garbage trucks hitting
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr and others running to the scene soon beheld something
ghastly _ a bad dream, maybe, or the special effects of an action
movie.
</P>
<P>
   `It would be like, take a Tonka truck and drop it off into a
little, makeshift yard with a lot of force,'' Kerr said. ``It
knocked out the tree. There's this bus in my neighbor's yard. It
was like a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin was thrown out of the bus and landed atop the
apartment building. Paramedics tried in vain to revive him. Across
the Northwest, television viewers watched as he was given CPR.
</P>
<P>
   Below the bridge, glass and metal mixed with blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a swirl of metal and glass,'' said Judy Jurgi, who
watched the accident unfold from her front porch. ``I couldn't
believe it. It was like a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Sirens blared. Police, firefighters and paramedics thronged into
the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fire Department was all over the place. Within two
minutes, you could hear sirens coming from all directions,'' said
David Hardesty. ``It looks just like it does on television:
Everyone doing their job and not talking much.''
</P>
<P>
   From inside the bus, voices pleaded for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a couple of voices say, `Help me!''' Jurgi, 52, said.
Some people heard worried cries about spilled diesel fuel.
Passengers struggled to get out of the bus. The injured helped one
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard hollering and moaning and saw people trying to get
out,'' Mercy said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee lost one of her shoes as she was tossed around inside the
bus. And when the wreckage stopped moving, she was holding onto a
metal bar. ``I just didn't know what to do. I was in shock. I
realized people were leaving the bus. A man helped me out of the
emergency window.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee was taken to Swedish Medical Center, where she was in stable
condition last night.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics put numbers on victims as a triage was set up. Kerr
saw one man wearing No. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew then the body count was up there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One developmentally disabled passenger simply wandered away. A
neighborhood couple spotted him and kept him in safety.
</P>
<P>
   They flagged down a deputy fire chief who put the man into his
car and took him to a waiting ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Mercouriadis looked around her old neighborhood and didn't
recognize it. A man lay dying on the roof. Paramedics carried away
bloody passengers. Others waited in stunned silence for their turn
to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just crossed myself and said, `God help them,''' she said.

STARS PUT ON `GREEN STAR' JERSEY AND WEAR OUT CAPITALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Maybe the Stars can petition the NHL to wear their
``green star'' jersey every game.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off one of their worst performances of the season, the
Stars last night relied on the magic of the alternate sweater,
hammering the Washington Capitals, 4-0, and remaining unbeaten
(11-0-3) in the special-events jersey since unveiling it last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, does the league dictate when we can and can't wear
those?'' defenseman Darryl Sydor asked after the game, a cartoon
light bulb virtually appearing over his head. ``I mean we want to
wear them every game.''
</P>
<P>
   No such luck. The Stars have been approved for 15 dates by the
NHL and have used up six of those so far. The next appearance of
the ``green star'' isn't until Dec. 21 against the Montreal
Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Tough luck.
</P>
<P>
   But then the Stars are hoping they won't need luck after putting
out a total team effort against the Capitals and seemingly
restructuring their game in just one night.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defensemen Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk were
monsters, playing 24 minutes apiece, controlling the defensive zone
and chipping in two points apiece. Mike Modano had two goals and an
assist and left the Capitals' heads spinning with a series of
dazzling moves. Goalie Ed Belfour notched his first shutout of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hatcher was excellent. Modano was excellent. \RSergei\S Zubov
was excellent. Belfour was excellent,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said of the win that pushed the Stars' record to 12-4-3. ``Our
leaders led.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in direct contrast to a 5-2 loss to the New Jersey
Devils on Wednesday when Hatcher and Matvichuk struggled, Modano
was a nonfactor and Belfour was pulled after yielding three goals
in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Stars jumped ahead as Modano and Hatcher scored
even-strength goals in the first 3 minutes, 57 seconds. Modano took
a breakout pass from linemate Mike Keane, barreled in on Capitals
goalie Olaf Kolzig and, at the last instant, put on the brakes and
flicked a wrist shot past the befuddled Kolzig just 1:10 into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher then scored off a nice cross-ice pass from Jamie
Langenbrunner and, for the first time in the past three games, the
Stars weren't the team staring at a two-goal deficit in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two goals were important, but what was just as important
was that we were playing well defensively,'' Stars center Guy
Carbonneau said.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars continued that strong defensive play throughout the
game and never really gave the injured Capitals the chance to get
off the ice. Modano added his second goal on a second-period power
play and Hatcher then pushed it to 4-0 when he took a slick pass
from Dave Reid on an odd-man rush and shot through a Modano screen
at the 16:37 mark of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, Hatcher and Matvichuk were on the ice for all four
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The third period degenerated into a brawl as four Stars players
were in fights _ including Carbonneau, who engaged in fisticuffs
for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was good,'' Hitchcock said. ``We stood up for
each other.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just that kind of night. Belfour, who appeared to have
his first shutout since March 22 ruined on a Steve Konowalchuk goal
with 57.8 seconds remaining, earned a reprieve when video-replay
judges declared Konowalchuk in the crease and waived off the goal.
</P>
<P>
   It had to be the magic green star, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're as superstitious as anyone,'' Sydor said. ``We want
to wear them every night.'' \Ntagtop: Mike Heika, (817) 390-7760

<P>
   With Decision Day looming, Albert Belle remained undecided
Friday night on his immediate future even as his agent moved closer
to a deal with the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking good, but we're not there yet,'' Arn Tellem,
Belle's agent said Friday evening about negotiations with the
Orioles. ``It's premature to say it's done. There's still one issue
we haven't resolved. I assume we can resolve it, but it's not there
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Belle himself remained another issue, a friend said. ``Albert
could change his mind,'' the friend said, speaking on the condition
of anonymity. ``He could decide to go back to the White Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer with knowledge of negotiations between free agents and
clubs said Friday that Belle had spoken with Jerry Reinsdorf, the
owner of the White Sox, to determine if there is a way he could
comfortably return to the team. That way, the lawyer said, could be
paved by money being added to the existing contract or be
accomplished through a contract extension or an extension of his
no-trade provision that expires after next season.
</P>
<P>
   With an offer of $65 million for five years, the Orioles are the
only alternative right now that Belle has to the White Sox. The
Boston Red Sox had expressed interest, but said earlier this week
that they no longer were pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   Under a clause in the five-year, $55 million contract he signed
two years ago, Belle has until next Wednesday to be a free agent
and sign with another team or choose to stay with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking with Reinsdorf, the slugging left fielder apparently
wants to determine whether the White Sox will take steps to become
a serious contender in the next couple of years. But, the lawyer
said, Belle also wants assurances that the club will not turn
around a year from now and trade him. They could do that once his
no-trade provision disappears from the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsdorf did not return a telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox might be relieved to be free of the $35 million
they owe Belle for the next three years. They had the fourth-lowest
attendance in the major leagues last year and have shown no
indication they will do anything to rouse the fans next season.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson is another free agent who expects to make a
decision in the next few days. Alan Nero, one of his agents, said
the pitcher hopes to decide by Monday if he wants to stay home and
play for the Arizona Diamondbacks or pitch for Anaheim, Los Angeles
or Texas. All four teams apparently have offered four-year
contracts for $12.5 million or $13 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough decision,'' Nero said. ``Randy's really
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   The agent said the Yankees removed themselves from Johnson's
list by failing to make an offer.
</P>
<P>
   The continued presence of the Dodgers on the list was somewhat
of a surprise. Given Johnson's choice of teams and his earlier
stated criteria for selecting one, the Dodgers appeared to trail
the others because they play in the National League and hold spring
training in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Dodgers are considering selling their Vero Beach
complex and moving their spring operations to Arizona. In addition,
Johnson has decided the league does not matter, and he also likes
the prospect of playing for Davey Johnson, the Dodgers' new
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball executives nevertheless continue to believe that
the left-hander will choose between the hometown Diamondbacks and
the Angels, whose signing of Mo Vaughn on Wednesday has not dimmed
their interest in giving Johnson a lot of money, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks are not on the playing level of the Angels, the
Rangers or even the Dodgers, but Nero said Johnson believed they
would be a contender before long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the four-year period,'' the agent said, ``we all believe
and have enough confidence in Jerry Colangelo and Buck Showalter
that they will contend in that period.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who a year ago acquired and gave lucrative
contracts to shortstop Jay Bell and third baseman Matt Williams,
have signed Todd Stottlemyre and Armando Reynoso, both pitchers, as
free agents this off-season.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion team, which plays only a few miles from Johnson's
new house, had been interested in Bernie Williams, but the Yankees
signed him on Wednesday. ``Once they signed Williams, that took
Arizona out of the picture and cleared that up,'' Nero said.
</P>
<P>
   The other attractive pitcher available as a free agent is Kevin
Brown. He is being sought primarily by the Orioles and the Colorado
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who pitched for Baltimore in 1995, has played on World
Series teams the past two years, Florida last season and San Diego
this, and the Orioles are probably closer to reaching the playoffs
than the Rockies. But the Rockies are more likely to make the most
lucrative offer.
</P>
<P>
   The agent Scott Boras said he wanted a six-year contract for
Brown, and he sought more money than the $12.5 million a year the
Red Sox gave Pedro Martinez a year ago. If Brown picks the Rockies,
Boras may try to get an $84 million contract, whose $14 million
average would make the pitcher the highest-paid player in baseball
history.

TROJANS FAVORED THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The quarterback controversy has been a
distraction. So has the losing streak to a bitter archrival. Even
the quality of the bowl game is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   There always seems to be so many dilemmas swirling around USC.
But this isn't a mini-dissection of the Trojans. Instead, all of
these traumas belong to Notre Dame. Yes, Notre Dame, the
ninth-ranked team in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   How a top 10 team could enter tonight's game at the Coliseum
with more problems than the Trojans seems implausible, but then
again, somebody's listening because USC has been established as an
8{-point favorite.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a single injury, the Irish (9-1) arrive with more
doubts than the Trojans. A pretty heady accomplishment considering
USC (7-4) is coming off a seven-turnover performance against UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   But when Irish quarterback Jarious Jackson partially tore the
medial collateral ligament in his right knee while intentionally
taking a safety against Louisiana State, the Irish lost a lot of
what the oddsmakers liked about the Irish.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame coach Bob Davie has not named a starter, but freshman
Arnaz Battle is expected to get the call. Battle, who has thrown
just one pass this season, played in three games before spraining
his shoulder last month against Baylor. He has fully recovered from
the injury. Junior Eric Chappell has also thrown just one pass and
played in parts of two games.
</P>
<P>
   Both quarterbacks are in the Jackson mold, meaning the Irish
will be primarily running the ball and use a little option.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know much about them. We can guess,'' USC coach Paul
Hackett said. ``The reality is that until the game starts and until
the game begins to unfold, we're just not going to know exactly
what we're up against. You just go in and play against what you
think they can do. That can be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not the first time a Notre Dame quarterback has made his
initial college start against the Trojans. In 1966, Coley O'Brien
replaced the injured Terry Hanratty and led the Irish to a 51-0
victory over the Trojans, Notre Dame's most lopsided victory of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a history of teams making this change and performing
brilliantly,'' Hackett said. ``I'm hoping this is not one of those
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Davie has tried to remain non-committal about the quarterback
situation, offering only this tidbit about who will play the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put one criteria on it. If he leads us to a touchdown on the
first five possessions of the game, I am not going to take him out.
You can write that,'' Davie joked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're approaching this like both are going to play.
You know, it's not that big of an issue. It's going to come down to
how the game goes. Both of those quarterbacks will play though. But
right now, we'll play it by ear a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, USC quarterback Carson Palmer has his first
edge in experience, about to make his fourth college start. Palmer
is debuting in this rivalry and couldn't be giddier about facing
the Irish. He has relished talking about how Notre Dame asked him
to retake his Scholastic Assessment Test, and still had problems
admitting him into school after he complied with the request. That
has only added to his motivation for playing well today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting for this game for a long time,'' Palmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish are also out to break their two-game losing streak to
USC, something the Trojans can relate to after being winless the
previous 13 contests.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a lot of bowl uncertainty for both teams. USC is
pitching for a bid to the Holiday Bowl and a probable meeting with
Nebraska with a victory. If the Trojans lose, it's probably on to
El Paso, where possible opponents include Virginia Tech, Syracuse
and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   There's also an outside chance the Trojans could go to the Aloha
Bowl to play either Air Force or Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go to Hawaii,'' Palmer said, unaware that it
carries the least prestige of the three options. ``Not a lot of
people (on the team) have gone to Hawaii.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame (9-1) has loftier aspirations, but a victory is a
must today. The Irish are trying to land a spot in the Rose Bowl _
if UCLA makes the Fiesta Bowl _ which sends shudders throughout the
Pacific-10 Conference. Today might be the first time every other
school actually roots for the Trojans to eliminate the chance that
Arizona will be overlooked in favor of the Irish. With a loss,
Notre Dame is expected to slide down to the Gator Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when USC and Notre Dame play, there's always a bit
of a bowl atmosphere. The game will be televised nationally by ABC
and a crowd of about 90,000 is expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people will watch this game than the UCLA game,'' Hackett
said. ``We've got to meet the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: USC legends Marv Goux and Lynn Swann spoke to the Trojans
on Friday. Goux, a former player and coach, is famous for his fiery
speeches regarding the Notre Dame game.

KITNA GOES FROM PARTIER TO STARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Promising quarterback. Devoted husband. Loving
father of two. Family man. Devout Christian.
</P>
<P>
   To the labels that Jon Kitna wears so well and with such pride,
add a new one. Not starting quarterback, although Kitna will be in
the Seahawks' game against the Tennessee Oilers Sunday at the
Kingdome, replacing the benched Warren Moon.
</P>
<P>
   No, this is a story about the side of Jon Kitna most people
don't know _ the person he no longer is, but is stronger for having
been.
</P>
<P>
   Drunken lout.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Kitna now, at 26 and seemingly in such control of his
life and destiny, it is hard to imagine he behaved that way. But
that was Kitna during his early years at Central Washington
University.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of college students drink, but Kitna was out of control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drinking a lot _ to the point of blackout,'' he said
this week while standing in front of his cubicle in the Seahawks'
locker room. ``There were times when I would drink and drive and
not know or remember how I got home.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna also went through the embarrassing ordeal of being
arrested for petty theft on campus.
</P>
<P>
   But his life spiraled to its lowest point one night in October
1993, when his girlfriend, and now wife, Jennifer, caught him with
another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing the pain he caused Jennifer was the event needed to make
Kitna step back and take a serious look at where he wanted to go,
as opposed to where he was headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the outside everything looked good,'' he said. ``I was the
starting quarterback. I had a good girlfriend. But on the inside
there was something missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that night, when Jennifer caught me with another girl,
that all this stuff came to a head,'' he said. ``It was like, `Man,
I need to make a decision. Either I'm going to continue to go down
this road, which is going nowhere, or I need to change my life.'''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna's first call was not to his parents, Fay and Martin. Or
even Jennifer. He called former CWU wide receiver Eric Boles, who
was then with the New York Jets but had been what Kitna calls ``my
mentor'' during his freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   Why Boles? ``Eric had made the same change about a year
earlier,'' Kitna said. ``So I called him and said, `How do I make
that change?'''
</P>
<P>
   Boles had dedicated himself to Christ, and told Kitna he would
have to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took me through the sinners' prayer, and immediately I felt
the guilt lift off of me,'' Kitna said. ``I wasn't changed right
away. But from that point forward, it's when everything started
changing. I stopped cussing overnight and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna was raised in a church-going family and went to a private
Lutheran school in Tacoma until he was in the fourth grade. He had
tried to alter the course of his life on his own, but it didn't
work until he got serious and Boles got involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things started changing and it's been one blessing after
another,'' Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he and Jennifer were married. They had their first
child, Jordan, last year and a second, Jada, last week. On the
field, Kitna led the Wildcats to a share of the NAIA national
championship in 1995; signed with the Seahawks as a free agent in
1996 after no other team even gave him a sniff; quarterbacked
Barcelona to a World League championship in 1997; and now, he is
not just the starting quarterback, but one of the most popular and
likable players on the team.
</P>
<P>
   With the center stage comes a platform. And Kitna plans to use
it. That's why he didn't mind opening his personal closet this week
and dragging out a few skeletons from his past.
</P>
<P>
   ``If talking about what I've been through can help another kid
who's going through the same thing, that's why God put me in this
position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna also realizes talking about God and being saved is a quick
way to turn people off. That's why he doesn't bludgeon them with
his beliefs, choosing instead to select his spots and help those
who ask for it. Much like Boles did with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't want to know, they're not going to listen,''
Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   And Kitna has a message worth listening to. During his
wild-and-crazy days, he wasn't just hurting himself, but also those
he loved. And not just Jennifer. There where his parents and his
younger brother, Matt.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of college kids do the kinds of things I was doing,''
Kitna said. ``But I just took it too far. The stealing. The
drinking. When you don't know how you get home at night, that's
scary.''
</P>
<P>
   With his parents in Tacoma and Kitna raising hell in Ellensburg,
it took a while for his father and mother to realize just how far
their son had veered off the path.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was his age, I did basically some of the same things he
did,'' Martin Kitna said. ``So I didn't think it was that
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Fay Kitna did, especially when her son would come home for the
weekend only to stay out all night partying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when my mom told me, `If you're going to come
home and not stay at the house, then don't come home at all,'''
Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
   That was the breaking point, Fay Kitna said. ``It just wasn't
productive. A lot of kids that age do those things. But Jon wasn't
getting anywhere doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the entire family has survived Kitna's self-destructive
binge, his father says, ``He's a helluva lot stronger than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   And his life is in order. He considers himself a man of God
first, then a husband, a father, a family man and a preacher of the
word of God. After that comes football player.
</P>
<P>
   Kitna has a passion for the game, and loves playing it. But, he
offers, ``My life isn't good because I'm a football player. I'm a
football player because my life is good.''

REIGN BEATS SAN JOSE IN DOUBLE OVERTIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM MOORE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Pro basketball returned to KeyArena Friday night. Even
though Frank Brickowski showed up, the Sonics weren't in the house.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seattle Reign was, along with 7,358 spectators, who
formed the largest crowd to ever watch an American Basketball
League game here.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately capping the festive evening, the Reign remained
unbeaten in six games with a 103-97 victory over San Jose in double
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Shalonda Enis scored seven of her 37 points in the second
overtime, and Val Whiting also figured prominently with six points
in the final three minutes, relentlessly hitting the boards and the
baskets. Whiting ended up with 24 points and 14 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   After playing 49 of the game's 50 minutes, Enis was exhausted
but smiling afterward. Though the Reign has been winning, last
season's ABL rookie of the year did not feel like she was
contributing, entering the game with a 10.6 scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling her it's the system,'' Reign point guard Niesa
Johnson said. ``If we're still winning, that means you are doing
your job.''
</P>
<P>
   But Enis was used to being a go-to player who scores 18 points a
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been kind of struggling emotionally,'' said Enis, who was
two points away from her career high. ``I really truly needed this
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle did too. This was a perfect showcase for women's pro
basketball, two gifted teams battling for 2{ hours, the lead
changing hands all night long.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wanted it to end,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Reign appeared ready to walk away with a 75-72 victory until
Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil zipped around a screen and hit a 3-pointer
to tie the game as the horn sounded, ending the fourth quarter
</P>
<P>
   The first overtime ended with another surprise. Trailing 88-87,
the Reign seemed to be finished when Davis-Wrightsil rebounded a
driving miss by Niesa Johnson. But Davis-Wrightsil called a timeout
and San Jose did not have any left.
</P>
<P>
   That resulted in two free throws for Seattle's Kate Starbird,
who missed the first but made the second, forcing double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The game had a lot to do with it, but there was an energized
atmosphere that Mercer Arena can't duplicate. The KeyArena sound
system is state-of-the-art. The lights are brighter. There is a
scoreboard with replay screens. It just seemed like a bigger deal
at a better venue.
</P>
<P>
   All of the fans watched from seats in the lower bowl, which
wasn't completely packed, just sufficiently jammed. No seats in the
upper concourse were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of having everyone close to the court gave the feel
of a full arena and certainly sounded like one.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have 7,000 people in your ears, my head feels like it's
going to explode,'' Enis said.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Center officials asked the Reign to play this game at
KeyArena, needing dates to help satisfy conditions for suite
holders. The NBA lockout has wiped out two months of Sonics' games,
including Friday night's that was scheduled here against the
Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle fans got Kate Paye instead of Gary Payton. The referees
called Angela Aycock for a carry on her dribble, which never would
have happened in an NBA game.
</P>
<P>
   But there were similarities to the men's game. San Jose's Kedra
Holland-Corn looked like Jason Kidd on one drive, softly dropping
in a bank shot while falling to the floor. Aycock and
Davis-Wrightsil exchanged a pair of 3-pointers from the corner, a
la Dale Ellis and Rex Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the same whining and stomping coach on the
visitors' bench. Friday night Angela Beck got a technical foul, not
Danny Ainge.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Reign fans enjoyed the evening at KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a bigger arena, you have more presence in the media,'' said
season ticket holder Matria Ohora of Seattle. ``It's real important
for the women's professional game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why worry about the Sonics? Go to one ABL game and you will
see an incredibly good, fast-paced game.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohora, though, was unhappy with her fourth-row seat. She
normally sits directly behind the visitor's bench.
</P>
<P>
   Vernell Pratt of Seattle prefers the intimacy of Mercer Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels more like my team, my basketball game,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But KeyArena was acceptable. ``We might as well use it for good
basketball since it's being wasted,'' Pratt said, referring to the
lockout.
</P>
<P>
   At Friday night's game you could sit 10 rows from the floor at
midcourt for $20. That's where Russ Nieboer and Julie Pickett were,
watching their first Reign game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to see one,'' Nieboer said, adding that he plans
to return.
</P>
<P>
   He was part of the seventh-largest turnout for women's
basketball in the city's history, topped by the 8,170 who attended
the University of Washington's game against DePaul in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be at KeyArena with so many people here was a great
experience,'' Reign coach Tammy Holder said. ``I hope they all come
back to see what heart and soul and desire this team has.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ When Congo's president, Laurent Kabila, got
ready for a trip to Europe last week, he sent an advance party to
Belgium, his first stop, to seek assurances that there would be no
nasty surprises waiting _ an arrest warrant, for example. Kabila,
who seized power in a long march to Kinshasa in 1997 and who has
resisted all international efforts to investigate how many lives
may have been lost in massacres along the way, is now living in the
post-Pinochet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremble, tyrants!'' was the editorial message the Paris
newspaper Liberation sent to a list of dictators after a panel from
Britain's House of Lords, the country's highest legal authority,
ruled Wednesday that former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was
not entitled to immunity from arrest under a British law protecting
former heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83, was in Britain for back surgery when a Spanish
judge asked for his arrest on charges of mass murder and terrorism.
A democratic Chilean government, which argues that it has put the
Pinochet years behind it, is appealing. British Home Secretary Jack
Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to turn the general over.
</P>
<P>
   But however the case is finally resolved, the arrest of Pinochet
and the Lords' ruling upholding it may have opened a new era in the
practice of international human rights law. ``It is a decision
without precedent,'' said El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper. ``The
basis is beginning to be set for what can and should be justice
without borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision falls into what had been almost a legal vacuum,
making it all the more interesting to human rights specialists.
International norms have been laid down broadly in human rights
conventions, but there have been no universally agreed definitions
and procedures. In the case of Cambodia's Pol Pot, for example,
there is no unanimity that he could have been prosecuted for
genocide, though there is wide agreement that a charge of crimes
against humanity would stand up.
</P>
<P>
   What is important in the Pinochet precedent, said Jose Miguel
Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch,
is that a high court has ruled that crimes like extrajudicial
executions and torture ``do not qualify as legitimate acts of a
head of state,'' and therefore did not qualify for the immunity
extended to foreign government leaders in Britain. Vivanco said
that whether Pinochet is ultimately extradited or not, this case
has established a principle.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights,
hailed the ruling as one to ``hearten human rights defenders around
the world.'' No longer can generals and other authoritarians who,
having spent years persecuting real and imagined enemies, fly off
with complete assurance of immunity to Europe or the United States
for shopping or medical treatment. A medical emergency was the
reason given for allowing Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi to enter the
United States after he was overthrown in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement abroad, even when part of a political settlement that
rids a country of a dictator, may become more problematical for
those driven out of their pillaged countries. Among retired
dictators now living remarkably well somewhere else are Idi Amin of
Uganda (in Saudi Arabia) and Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier of
Haiti (in France). Last week a right-wing French politician,
criticizing the Pinochet decision, said that half the heads of
state heading for a French-African summit in Paris this weekend
``could end up in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some sleeper cases waiting to be heard. What if people
in East Timor, whose independence drive has been brutally repressed
by Indonesia, try to nail President Suharto next time he travels
abroad _ if the Indonesians ever let their ousted dictator travel.
</P>
<P>
   And Sikhs in Britain, Canada and the United States have been
waiting for the chance to hold India's Congress Party leaders
responsible for the massacres of several thousand Sikhs in New
Delhi and other cities in a few days following the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Sikh bodyguards.
More people died in that pogrom, Sikh leaders have been saying,
than all those killed in Chile in 17 years under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   For human rights groups, there is special meaning in the timing
of the Pinochet rulings. This year the world celebrates the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
Eleanor Roosevelt, among other Americans, was instrumental in
pushing through the United Nations as the Cold War loomed.
</P>
<P>
   In general, this has been a remarkable year for human rights,
despite setbacks in Congo, Kosovo, Algeria and other troubled
areas. International tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda have been
handing down sentences, including the first convictions for rape as
a war crime. In June, a treaty established the first International
Criminal Court, a permanent body on call to deal with rogue leaders
in a systematic way so that a mastermind of death like the late Pol
Pot would not pose a jurisdictional problem if caught.
</P>
<P>
   Still, efforts to subordinate national sovereignty to
internationalist notions of universal crimes are especially tricky
for the United States.

resisted all international efforts to investigate how many lives
may have been lost in massacres along the way, is now living in the
post-Pinochet era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tremble, tyrants!'' was the editorial message the Paris
newspaper Liberation sent to a list of dictators after a panel from
Britain's House of Lords, the country's highest legal authority,
ruled Wednesday that former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was
not entitled to immunity from arrest under a British law protecting
former heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 83, was in Britain for back surgery when a Spanish
judge asked for his arrest on charges of mass murder and terrorism.
A democratic Chilean government, which argues that it has put the
Pinochet years behind it, is appealing. British Home Secretary Jack
Straw has until Dec. 11 to decide whether to turn the general over.
</P>
<P>
   But however the case is finally resolved, the arrest of Pinochet
and the Lords' ruling upholding it may have opened a new era in the
practice of international human rights law. ``It is a decision
without precedent,'' said El Mundo, a Spanish newspaper. ``The
basis is beginning to be set for what can and should be justice
without borders.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision falls into what had been almost a legal vacuum,
making it all the more interesting to human rights specialists.
International norms have been laid down broadly in human rights
conventions, but there have been no universally agreed definitions
and procedures. In the case of Cambodia's Pol Pot, for example,
there is no unanimity that he could have been prosecuted for
genocide, though there is wide agreement that a charge of crimes
against humanity would stand up.
</P>
<P>
   What is important in the Pinochet precedent, said Jose Miguel
Vivanco, director of the Americas division of Human Rights Watch,
is that a high court has ruled that crimes like extrajudicial
executions and torture ``do not qualify as legitimate acts of a
head of state,'' and therefore did not qualify for the immunity
extended to foreign government leaders in Britain. Vivanco said
that whether Pinochet is ultimately extradited or not, this case
has established a principle.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights,
hailed the ruling as one to ``hearten human rights defenders around
the world.'' No longer can generals and other authoritarians who,
having spent years persecuting real and imagined enemies, fly off
with complete assurance of immunity to Europe or the United States
for shopping or medical treatment. A medical emergency was the
reason given for allowing Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi to enter the
United States after he was overthrown in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement abroad, even when part of a political settlement that
rids a country of a dictator, may become more problematical for
those driven out of their pillaged countries. Among retired
dictators now living remarkably well somewhere else are Idi Amin of
Uganda (in Saudi Arabia) and Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier of
Haiti (in France). Last week a right-wing French politician,
criticizing the Pinochet decision, said that half the heads of
state heading for a French-African summit in Paris this weekend
``could end up in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some sleeper cases waiting to be heard. What if people
in East Timor, whose independence drive has been brutally repressed
by Indonesia, try to nail President Suharto next time he travels
abroad _ if the Indonesians ever let their ousted dictator travel.
</P>
<P>
   And Sikhs in Britain, Canada and the United States have been
waiting for the chance to hold India's Congress Party leaders
responsible for the massacres of several thousand Sikhs in New
Delhi and other cities in a few days following the 1984
assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by Sikh bodyguards.
More people died in that pogrom, Sikh leaders have been saying,
than all those killed in Chile in 17 years under Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   For human rights groups, there is special meaning in the timing
of the Pinochet rulings. This year the world celebrates the 50th
anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which
Eleanor Roosevelt, among other Americans, was instrumental in
pushing through the United Nations as the Cold War loomed.
</P>
<P>
   In general, this has been a remarkable year for human rights,
despite setbacks in Congo, Kosovo, Algeria and other troubled
areas. International tribunals for the Balkans and Rwanda have been
handing down sentences, including the first convictions for rape as
a war crime. In June, a treaty established the first International
Criminal Court, a permanent body on call to deal with rogue leaders
in a systematic way so that a mastermind of death like the late Pol
Pot would not pose a jurisdictional problem if caught.
</P>
<P>
   Still, efforts to subordinate national sovereignty to
internationalist notions of universal crimes are especially tricky
for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with half a dozen other nations including Iraq and Libya,
the Americans voted against setting up the new court. The Clinton
administration, especially the Pentagon, feared that there were not
enough safeguards to prevent U.S. soldiers from being brought to
trial for acts committed in the line of duty abroad. A
Republican-led Congress would go farther, saying that no American
should even be subject to international legal proceedings. Suppose
Cambodians decided to indict Henry Kissinger on charges of ordering
the bombing of their country during the Vietnam War? Chances are
the United States would be quick to take a line of defense not
unlike Chile's, saying that history has rendered its judgment on
that war, people on the whole do not get tried for policies and
U.S. courts have dealt with those individuals who had committed
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. leaders have long been skittish about international courts
and covenants, and apprehensive that foreign political agendas
would run wild in international forums. The United States routinely
refuses to recognize decisions of the International Court of
Justice, which was set up to adjudicate among nations, not to try
individuals. That tribunal, known as the World Court, has been
used, government officials say, to score policy points such as
opposition to a U.S. embargo on Nicaragua during the Sandinista
years, or in favor of the outlawing of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Strong campaigns in the Third World against international
corporations, big banks and other symbols of Western-style
capitalism have already led to mock trials. Countries shaky on due
process have been minefields for years.
</P>
<P>
   In international human rights bodies, including the U.N. Human
Rights Commission and the General Assembly when it sits as a human
rights committee, the United States has been regularly attacked by
developing nations determined to prove Americans no better than
other nations in rights protection. U.S. officials call it a policy
of moral equivalency employed to deflect attention from abuses or
constraints on human liberty in countries as diverse as Cuba, Kenya
or Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Clinton administration has welcomed
international human rights investigators, hoping that openness will
dispel some criticism and demonstrate a willingness to deal with
problems that arise in law enforcement and the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   The gesture has sometimes backfired, however, as human rights
monitors _ often using American newspaper clippings _ portray
admitted shortcomings as gross violations of international human
right covenants, often phrasing the accusations in the language of
the covenants.
</P>
<P>
   A series of U.N. monitors and Amnesty International, based in
London, have issued tough reports on the United States in the last
year or two. Amnesty, using the code words for major offenders,
found ``a persistent and widespread pattern of violations.'' Across
the country, its report concluded, ``thousands of people are
subjected to sustained and deliberate brutality'' by police forces
and the federal government has to take responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   If Americans fear an indictment one day of a U.S. president in a
foreign court, such fears are misplaced, said Vivanco of Human
Rights Watch, who noted how silent the Clinton administration was
when the Pinochet verdict was delivered Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Such exceptional cases, Vivanco said, are reserved for
perpetrators of war crimes or crimes against humanity who have not
been judged by their own courts. In those cases there is no normal
redress, as Spanish lawyers argued. ``At the domestic level, there
was no chance whatsoever to punish him,'' Vivanco said.

 SMOKESCREEN: THE IFs AND BUTs OF THE TOBACCO SETTLEMENT  
(The Week in Review)

<P>
   Last week's $206 billion settlement between the tobacco industry
and 46 states is supposed to put Big Tobacco on the run. The
agreement requires cigarette makers to compensate states for the
medical costs of treating smoking-related diseases. It's been
hailed as a triumph of the public interest over special interests.
But a closer look at the hard economics behind the agreement
reveals something quite different.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, economists and legal experts who have studied the
deal say, isn't that the damages won by the states are too small,
as leaders of the anti-smoking lobby complain.
</P>
<P>
   It's that 99 percent of the total settlement is really a
disguised tax hike.
</P>
<P>
   Taxing cigarettes more heavily may or may not be a good idea,
the critics say, but labeling as ``damages'' what is effectively a
sales tax is misleading and will create a boondoggle for trial
lawyers and a windfall for the smaller tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, the Big Four tobacco producers will wind up
paying direct damages of at most 1 percent of the settlement total,
or $2.4 billion. That amount, calculated as a proportion of the
companies' current market value, is to be paid regardless of how
many packs of cigarettes they sell in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the $206 billion will be paid by smokers: Cigarette
prices are expected to climb by an average of about 35 cents a
pack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reasonable people can disagree whether increasing the
cigarette tax is a good or bad idea,'' said Jeremy Bulow, the
incoming chief economist of the Federal Trade Commission. ``But the
reason that the attorneys general don't want to call it a tax is so
they can claim a political victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, investors thought the deal was worth celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 20, the day the attorneys general announced the
settlement, the stock of the leading tobacco companies soared.
Investors chose to disbelieve that an industry with profits of $5
billion a year would be paying $8 billion a year in damages for the
next 25 years. Instead, the investors gave credence to stock
analysts who believe that the profits of tobacco companies will
decline by a maximum of 10 percent. And cigarette producers wasted
no time in raising prices _ a day after the settlement was signed
on Monday, two major companies raised prices 45 cents a pack.
</P>
<P>
   The higher prices represent what is essentially an old-fashioned
sales tax, the very kind of tax that the Republican Congress shot
down a few months back as ``big government.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it a tax? The fact that the amount paid is to rise
and fall with the number of cigarette packs sold.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sales taxes, it is borne primarily by the consumer.
``Every single cigarette tax ever passed has been paid fully by the
consumer,'' said John Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and a former deputy Treasury secretary.
``There's no reason to think this will be any different.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck . . .,'' Gruber
added. ``It's a tax because it's a set of payments made by tobacco
companies that depend on how many packs they sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most economists think it makes sense to use taxes to have
the price of cigarettes reflect their true social cost, though
some, like Bulow, have reservations because the taxes fall heavily
on the poor. And as tobacco companies have known for years, the
evidence is compelling that raising prices leads some smokers to
cut back and deters teen-agers from picking up the habit.
</P>
<P>
   But by disguising a de facto sales tax as damages, the critics
maintain, the states have agreed to a deal with unintended
consequences that are just hinted at in the joint news release
describing the 100-page settlement. By calling taxes damages, the
critics say, the states wound up agreeing to provisions that
Congress would never dream of if it passed a tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   For example, economists cite the huge contingency fees that the
200 or so trial lawyers who helped produce the agreement will
collect. Under the deal, the lawyers will divide $1.25 billion
initially and about $500 million a year thereafter. That's an $8
billion payout, or 20 times the biggest contingency fee ever paid,
the $400 million collected by a lawyer in the 1985 Texaco-Pennzoil
case.
</P>
<P>
   Gruber calls the legal fees ``huge, gross and disgusting.''
Bulow estimates that had the fees been calculated only on the basis
of actual damages, each lawyer would receive an average of about $1
million apiece, versus the $40 million apiece that the lawyers will
actually collect.
</P>
<P>
   ``By calling the settlement `damages' it makes it seem
reasonable to pay the lawyers a lot,'' said Paul Klemperer, an
economist at Oxford University. ``If you called it taxes, you
wouldn't expect to give lawyers a fraction of the tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers maintain they are being paid fairly for taking a
huge gamble. But for one thing, some states hadn't even got around
to filing suits against the tobacco companies, so the lawyers in
those states haven't done much of anything yet. And those lawyers
who have put in time did most of their work in the past year _
after it became clear that a broad settlement was a near-certain
bet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A second consequence of calling taxes damages is that the deal,
far from inflicting pain on all cigarette producers, actually
enriches a few of them. Take Liggett &AMP; Myers, which until recently
was valued at about $120 million and which hadn't turned a profit
in several years. Under the deal, Liggett will actually collect an
annual subsidy of about $100 million, courtesy of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how. A tax hike applies to all cigarette producers, big
and small, current and future. But the states can only collect
damages from the companies they are suing: in this case, the Big
Four: Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco and
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But by limiting damages to the largest companies, the states
would be handing smaller tobacco producers like Liggett a cost
advantage of 35 cents a pack, since the Big Four would have to
raise their prices, while the little guys would not. Given that it
costs just 20 cents to manufacture a pack of cigarettes, that's a
huge advantage.
</P>
<P>
   How did the states solve the problem? In effect, they told the
small companies that if they agreed to be ``taxed'' they would be
allowed _ up to a limit higher than their current sales _ to keep
the revenue they collected instead of turning them in to the
states. Thus, Liggett can match the higher prices charged by the
Big Four companies but doesn't have to hand over any of the extra
income except in the unlikely event that its sales exceed 400
million packs, or 125 percent of its current sales.
</P>
<P>
   Even assuming that Liggett loses some sales when it raises its
prices, Klemperer said, the subsidy it will collect still amounts
to $100 million a year, an amount equal to its recent market value.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Liggett gained even more from the tobacco agreement.
Because of agreements reached earlier with some states, Liggett
wasn't as vulnerable as the other companies to states' threats to
pass punitive legislation if it failed to climb aboard. To induce
Liggett to sign on, Philip Morris, eager to dispel the threat of a
firm that could potentially produce cigarettes at a 35-cent cost
advantage, paid three times the value of the entire company for 3
of Liggett's 14 brands. The contract stipulated that Philip Morris
would pay Liggett $150 million even if the Federal Trade Commission
shoots down the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Ayres, a professor at the Yale Law School, is among those
worried about the precedent set by the settlement. ``It's scary.''
he said.

allowed _ up to a limit higher than their current sales _ to keep
the revenue they collected instead of turning them in to the
states. Thus, Liggett can match the higher prices charged by the
Big Four companies but doesn't have to hand over any of the extra
income except in the unlikely event that its sales exceed 400
million packs, or 125 percent of its current sales.
</P>
<P>
   Even assuming that Liggett loses some sales when it raises its
prices, Klemperer said, the subsidy it will collect still amounts
to $100 million a year, an amount equal to its recent market value.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Liggett gained even more from the tobacco agreement.
Because of agreements reached earlier with some states, Liggett
wasn't as vulnerable as the other companies to states' threats to
pass punitive legislation if it failed to climb aboard. To induce
Liggett to sign on, Philip Morris, eager to dispel the threat of a
firm that could potentially produce cigarettes at a 35-cent cost
advantage, paid three times the value of the entire company for 3
of Liggett's 14 brands. The contract stipulated that Philip Morris
would pay Liggett $150 million even if the Federal Trade Commission
shoots down the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Ayres, a professor at the Yale Law School, is among those
worried about the precedent set by the settlement. ``It's scary.''
he said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since it was created in 1935, Social Security has
been the centerpiece of the nation's social contract, an
intergenerational commitment to provide at least a subsistence
income to the most vulnerable of citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The commitment appears as solid as ever. But with Social
Security facing long-term financial problems, the means of making
good on it are now under serious debate for the first time since
Franklin D. Roosevelt proposed what would become the most enduring
of New Deal legacies.
</P>
<P>
   Ten months after President Clinton said that shoring up the
system should become the nation's top domestic priority, he and
congressional leaders will begin examining the options in earnest
and probing for common ground at a two-day White House conference
in December, kicking off a process that could as easily end in
partisan gridlock as in the historic achievement both parties are
hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Should the country stick with the system it has used for 63
years and continue to levy taxes on current workers and their
employers to pay current retirees? Or, as the time draws near for
the vast baby boom generation to move onto Social Security, should
the nation shift to a system under which individuals would invest a
portion of their payroll taxes in private retirement accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It is an issue that turns to some extent on the complexities of
actuarial tables, benefit formulas and other arcana. But in a
broader sense it encapsulates fundamental tradeoffs: between
individual and collective responsibility, market forces and
government, and maximizing rewards and minimizing risks. Indeed,
few issues have such a rich ideological backdrop or high political
stakes, a fact that promises to make the debate over Social
Security's future particularly contentious.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is rooted in inexorable demographic change. Because
there will be fewer workers paying taxes relative to the number of
retirees drawing benefits once the 76 million baby boomers leave
the workforce in coming decades, Social Security will take in only
enough revenue to pay 75 percent of its obligations starting around
2032.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach a solution are being framed in part by how the
world has changed since 1935. Life expectancy is shooting up, so
most people will spend far longer in retirement than anyone
envisioned six decades ago. Investing, long the province of the
elite, is now a routine part of middle-class life. Faith in
market-based capitalism, which probably hit a nadir around the time
of Social Security's creation, has long been on the rise, tested
though it has been by the recent bout of global financial turmoil.
At the same time, trust that government can deal with the big
issues has eroded since Vietnam and Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   To conservatives, such changes are a call to put more
responsibility in the hands of individuals and an opportunity to
put the power of the markets to work for everyone through private
Social Security accounts. If in the process the country scales back
the biggest of all government social programs, so much the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the reasons the debate has been so fierce,'' said
Michael Tanner, the director of health and welfare studies at the
libertarian Cato Institute. ``There's a recognition, particularly
on the part of the left, that Social Security and Medicare are the
last programmatic links between the average citizen and the
government.''
</P>
<P>
   To liberals, though, the changes that have taken place do not
undermine the case for a collective approach to income security for
the elderly and other beneficiaries of Social Security, including
disabled workers and those left behind when a breadwinner dies.
</P>
<P>
   Most individuals, said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, do not do a very good job of planning for
distant or unlikely events like retirement or disability. Moreover,
he said, since many people are already exposed to the risks of big
stock market swings through 401(k) programs and Individual
Retirement Accounts, there is good reason to maintain Social
Security as a guaranteed benefit in which any investment or
economic risks _ as well as administrative costs _ are spread
across the generations and income levels. The wild gyrations in the
stock market this year underscore the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reasons that led the nation to adopt social insurance are
about as strong now as they ever were,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   There is some common ground. Many, though not all, Democrats
support looking to the returns available on Wall Street to help
plug the hole, just as Republicans do. But rather than resort to
the wholesale shift into private accounts advocated by Republicans,
many Democrats want the investing to be done by the government
itself, using the surplus that will build up for the next 15 years
as payroll tax receipts exceed what the system pays out in
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nearly every facet of any plan is likely to have as many
opponents as supporters. Increasing the retirement age to, say, 70,
would go a long way toward restoring the system's health, but is
vehemently opposed by organized labor. Eliminating or substantially
raising the cap on earnings subject to the payroll tax _ currently
$68,400 _ would solve much of the problem, but would amount to a
big tax increase on middle-and upper-income people.
</P>
<P>
   So it remains unclear whether it will be politically feasible to
piece together a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing understanding that this is a big issue out
there,'' said Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel, ``but I
must say I have yet to see any kind of consensus emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Success will depend to some extent on political calculations by
both parties. Congressional Democrats will have to decide whether
to compromise now or delay in the hope that they might regain
control of the House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will have to decide whether to make a deal so they
can turn attention to what they see as a more potent issue, tax
cuts. And Clinton, more eager than ever after his travails this
year to leave a positive legacy, will have to decide whether to
take a bold stand or work behind the scenes to cobble together a
one-from-column-A, one-from-column-B solution.
</P>
<P>
   With more than three decades to go before the problem hits,
there would not appear to be much urgency. But economists say that
every year that goes by will make any solution more expensive to
taxpayers and beneficiaries alike. Perhaps more important, the
political and economic climate is as favorable now as it is likely
to be for years: a second-term president who does not have to worry
about re-election, a big federal budget surplus and a baby boom
generation that has a stake in keeping the system healthy for
another half century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reach a consensus on needed changes,'' said Michael
Boskin, who was the Bush administration's chief economist, ``adopt
them now and phase them in gradually before the demographic
transition overwhelms us economically and politically.''

   WASHINGTON _ Once upon a time, 1998 was going to be the year of
the electric car. In 1990 California announced that 2 percent of
the automobiles sold in the state by major manufacturers in 1998
would have to be nonpolluting. New York and Massachusetts soon
followed suit. The electric car was hailed as the route to clean
air and the antidote to dependence on imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   Today the electric car seems an idea whose time has been put on
hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the year it was all going to happen,'' said Nancy
Hazard, of the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, a
nonprofit advocacy group in Greenfield, Mass. ``Obviously it is not
unfolding as they anticipated it to unfold.'' As the last of the
1998 models leave dealers' lots, very few of them are running on
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   The technology behind electric car improves yearly, but the cars
themselves fail to attract buyers. Experts say the reason is they
are not as flexible as gasoline cars, so consumers are not lining
up, and policy makers have become reconciled to gasoline as engines
have become cleaner and oil cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Hazard and others are still enthusiastic about the
electric vehicle because technology has created a gasoline-electric
car, with potentially huge implications for energy use and
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The nomenclature has changed, too. Specialists once called
electric vehicles EVs, but they now call them battery electric
vehicles, or BEVs, to distinguish them from hybrid HEVs, which use
internal combustion engines to charge the batteries and electric
motors to turn the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Before this hybrid appeared, something quite unexpected happened
to the old internal combustion engine. The century-old automotive
technology, thought by many experts to have reached its limits,
adapted.
</P>
<P>
   California, when it first called for the electric car in 1990,
also set standards for cleanliness in regular cars; the most
stringent was the ``ultra-low emission vehicle,'' or ULEV. But the
state, the toughest in the nation when it came to the environment,
underestimated the capacity of auto makers to respond. Toyota has
plans for a gasoline car that is four times cleaner than the ULEV;
Honda plans one that is 10 times cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   This new car, the ``super ultra low emission vehicle,'' quickly
acquired its inevitable acronym: SULEV. ``California ran out of
superlatives, so they had to start compounding them,'' said David
Hermance, general manager in charge of engines at the Toyota
Technical Center USA Inc., in Gardena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   California recently enabled auto makers to meet their LEV quotas
with SULEVs instead. Of course, the nonpolluting electric car does
not emit pollutants itself, but that doesn't mean it doesn't
contribute to fouling the environment; somewhere out there is a
plant producing power for charging batteries. California's electric
power system, though, is very clean, and pollution for charging
batteries is much lower than for the ULEV. With the introduction of
the SULEV, the difference grows smaller; the cost is modest.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in Japan, Toyota introduced a hybrid car called the
Prius, which cost about 10 percent more than a Corolla and is the
same size. Its factories, which make 2,000 cars a month, cannot
keep up with demand. In 2000 the Prius will be sold in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Prius, which does not idle, has a gas engine to charge its
batteries or power its wheels. The result is low emissions and fuel
economy of 66 miles a gallon. Today every other major car company
has a hybrid on the drawing boards or in research, generally with
an internal-combustion engine as an auxiliary power unit.
</P>
<P>
   And oil is a tough competitor. The Energy Information
Administration, the government's main energy forecasting group,
pointed out last week that oil costs $7 a barrel less than it did a
year ago. Because of the Asian economic meltdown, prices are not
expected to rise to pre-crisis levels until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The shift away from battery electric cars is disappointing to
purists and some engineers, partly because the vehicles can get
their energy from ``clean'' sources like the sun as well as from
coal, natural gas or oil. But efficiency alone is not enough to
sell products.
</P>
<P>
   Still, mass production of the hybrid means further improvements
in electric engines, paving the way for a pure electric car if
better batteries become available. In the meantime, Ms. Hazard
said, ``more and more, consumers are seeking information on
environmentally friendly automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the auto companies can produce a vehicle which meets their
driving needs, they will make that green choice,'' she said.

<P>
   Let's all share a sardonic chuckle over this cosmic paradox: At
the height of its global ascendancy, supposedly optimistic and
youth-obsessed America is now also increasingly fixated on death.
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery: As the population ages, intimations of
mortality are focusing minds. This _ at the end of the millennium
no less _ helps to explain not just the vogue for mysticism and
attendant claptrap, but also why the folks at ``60 Minutes'' last
week figured that showing a mercy killing by Dr. Jack Kevorkian
after Sunday dinner would be good for ratings (followed by the
soothing otherworldly series ``Touched by an Angel'').
</P>
<P>
   America's No. 1 heartthrob, Brad Pitt, has been cast as the Grim
Reaper in ``Meet Joe Black.'' And Robin Williams, arguably the
country's funniest person, plays a serious dead guy who rescues his
dead wife from hell in the New Age tear-jerker ``What Dreams May
Come.'' The films may be bombs, but they affirm that Hollywood,
ever fond of bloody murder, is adjusting its mortal mix to try and
cash in on the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the fixation on mortality means a lot of trees have to die
too. And not just because of best-sellers like ``Tuesdays With
Morrie'' (Doubleday, 1997) by Mitch Ablom, about a sportswriter's
visits with his dying mentor; ``How We Die'' (Knopf, 1993) by
Sherwin B. Nuland, or the books of Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, champion
of the hospice movement.
</P>
<P>
   When a subject is hot _ actually, cold, in this case _ the
publishing industry stands ready to serve it up for different
audiences. Here is a sampling from dozens of recent books on death
and bereavement.
</P>
<P>
   _ By TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 1: ``Living With the End in Mind: A Practical
Checklist for Living Life to the Fullest by Embracing Your
Mortality'' (Three Rivers Press, 1998) by Erin Tierney Kramp and
Douglas H. Kramp, with Emily P. McKhann.
</P>
<P>
   The gist, from the cover blurb: A life-affirming look at
preparing yourself and your loved ones for the inevitable. . . .
The inspiring couple who have co-authored this book have already
garnered widespread media coverage, from ``20/20'' to ``The Oprah
Winfrey Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Sample Bit of Advice:
</P>
<P>
   Casually drive through the cemetery of your choice with your
children or grandchildren so it is familiar.
</P>
<P>
   We took our daughter to the cemetery on a beautiful, spring day
to talk about the burial process. A burial was taking place nearby,
and we pointed out the different stages of funerals. We said,
``Look, someone already went to heaven, and now they are burying
the body. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 2: ``The True Work of Dying: A Practical and
Compassionate Guide to Easing the Dying Process'' (Avon, 1997) by
Jan Selliken Bernard and Miriam Schnieder.
</P>
<P>
   The gist, from the cover blurb: This groundbreaking, holistic
guide presents rare insights and reassuring practical advice on how
to navigate the final weeks before death.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting coinage: Home deathing.
</P>
<P>
   Quote: Just as a little bit of home has been brought to the
birthing room, we believe medical institutions and families should
make the same effort to bring ``home'' to the ``deathing room,''
wherever it may be.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 3: ``Then an Angel Came: A Family's Inspiring True
Story of Loss and Renewal'' (Kensington, 1997) by Carol Gino.
</P>
<P>
   The gist: An ``unforgettable true story'' (cover blurb) about a
grieving family saved by an angel _ a very large angel _ after an
infant's death.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing description of angel: ``I mean, she wasn't only big,
she was magnificent. Skyscrapers are big, but mountains have
something extra. Well, this angel was like the Himalayas, she was
like the Grand Canyon, she was like . . .''
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 4:``How Different Religions View Death and
Afterlife'' (2d edition, The Charles Press, 1998), edited by
Christopher Jay Johnson, Ph.D., and Marsha G. McGee, Ph.D.
</P>
<P>
   The gist, from the cover blurb: The teaching and death beliefs
of the largest and fastest-growing religions in North America.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling question answered: ``Is There a Hell and, if So, What
Is It Like?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the book's answers, by religion:
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholics: Hell designates a condition of self-chosen,
permanent alienation from God, who bestows all blessings.
</P>
<P>
   Jews: The assumption is that God's caring nature rules out a
sadistic punishment. The nature of hell is a mystery left alone by
the Jew.
</P>
<P>
   Baptists: Most Southern Baptists believe in a place of
punishment as it is described in the Bible, characterized by outer
darkness, fire, torment and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhists: There are eight hot and cold hells, each associated
with a particular type of suffering. These tortures are described
in detail in order to develop compassion for the beings there as
well as to create an incentive not to engage in the types of
nonvirtuous behavior that will cause one to end up there.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims: Hell is described as a fire having seven levels. The
lowest crackles and roars with fierce boiling water, scorching wind
and wailing, wretched souls.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 5: ``What Happens When You Die, From Your Last Breath
to the First Spadeful'' (Citadel Press, 1995) by Robert T. Hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The gist: Your handy guide to embalming and cremation, with
alternatives ``including mummification _ and much more'' (cover
blurb).
</P>
<P>
   Unsettling information: The book summarizes the major forms of
bodily decay, including dessication:
</P>
<P>
   Dessication: The drying of certain parts, such as the cornea of
the eye, is usually a sure indication of death. As the fluids sink
to the back of the eye, the cornea dries out, glazes over and
becomes wrinkled. This dryness may also be observed over abrasions
or wounds. The lips also become hard and reddish black in color.

   DEATH BOOK 7: ``My Life After Dying: Becoming Alive to Universal

Army private George Ritchie died of pneumonia. Nine minutes later,
he came back _ profoundly changed.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-body experience: The author goes airborne after leaving
his body behind in his deathbed, but he soon gets lost and has to
ask for directions:
</P>
<P>
   I came down closer to the ground when I noticed a bright blue
color coming from a Pabst Blue Ribbon Beer neon sign in front of a
white cafe. . . . I saw a tall, thin man, bundled in a dark
overcoat coming up the sidewalk heading toward the door of this
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   I lit down about 12 feet in front of him. . . .``What is the
name of this city? Do you know where Richmond, Va., is and in what
direction I should go to get there?''

</P>
<P>
   DEATH BOOK 8: ``Kaddish'' (Knopf, 1998) by Leon Weiseltier.
</P>
<P>
   The gist: After the death of his father, the literary editor of
The New Republic goes long, deep and discursive about Jewish
mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Dream interpretation: I am walking in Oak Hill graveyard in
Georgetown. It is night. Near the little stone chapel I meet a man
in a pinstripe suit and shiny shoes. In each hand he carries a
legal briefcase. His face is streaked with soot. He asks for my
help. Both his briefcases are filled with wood, and he is seeking
somebody to carry the rest of what he has gathered. My

JANET RENO, JOB SECURITY AND THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW

 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than any other attorney general, Janet Reno
has been bedeviled by the independent counsel law. In just five
years, she has ordered the appointment of seven independent
prosecutors and turned down requests for a number of others, and is
now considering two more investigations of Clinton administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Her decisions have, in turn, infuriated both the White House and
its Republican critics, and her tenure at the Justice Department
has been largely defined by how she has used _ or, to some, misused
_ the law.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to being a constant source of political trouble
for Reno, the statute, enacted after Watergate to keep politics out
of high-level corruption cases, has probably helped Reno keep her
job, which she might have lost long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Following President Clinton's re-election in 1996, there was a
push by administration officials to get rid of her; they felt stung
by her quickness to appoint independent prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the polarized arena of independent counsel politics, each
time either the Democrats or the Republicans seem ready to take aim
at Reno, they draw back, fearing a backlash against what could look
like attacks on the political independence of a popular attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, with White House officials barely concealing their
relief, Reno took the political heat again by refusing to seek an
independent prosecutor to examine Vice President Al Gore's campaign
finance activities. Reno's job once again seemed secure. There is
no longer any backstairs gossip that Clinton wants to dump her.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Republicans had little realistic hope of doing
anything about their frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., demanded Judiciary Committee hearings
into her reluctance to pursue investigations of campaign financing,
but there seemed little desire among his colleagues to summon Reno
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dynamics could shift again, and soon. Monday she
must decide whether an outside prosecutor should investigate
whether former White House deputy chief of staff Harold M. Ickes
lied to Congress about his dealings with the Teamsters Union, whose
financial support the Democrats were seeking in the 1996 campaign.

   And next week she must decide whether to pursue allegations that
Clinton and his aides illegally evaded federal election laws when
they spent millions of dollars of Democratic Party funds on
political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department aides insist that Reno is unconcerned about
the impact of her decisions on her own job or political standing.
They said she has neutrally exercised the law, unmotivated by
politics, and has consistently applied an unwieldy federal statute.
</P>
<P>
   But as her Republican critics, like Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah,
the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have pointed out,
she has blocked for more than two years any appointment of an
independent prosecutor to investigate campaign finance cases. She
has refused to seek an independent counsel even though FBI Director
Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, the former head of her campaign
finance team, strongly recommended that she send the case to an
outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Should Reno decide to go forward with an independent prosecutor
in either the Ickes or the Clinton campaign advertising matters, it
will be the Clinton administration's turn to be upset. During
Clinton's first term, Reno's apparent eagerness to refer cases to
independent prosecutors made her a serious irritant to the White
House, where officials never made a secret of their differences
with Reno. They routinely dismissed her as a cranky loner.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the complaints, however, was a more substantive issue.
She had sought a string of independent counsel inquiries into
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, former Housing Secretary
Henry Cisneros; Ron Brown, the commerce secretary who died in a
plane crash in Croatia in 1996, and even a little known official,
Eli Segal, who headed the AmeriCorps national service program.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it was White House officials themselves who had asked
Reno to bring in an outside prosecutor to investigate Whitewater.
Reno obediently named a respected New York lawyer, Robert Fiske, to
conduct the inquiry. The case was later taken over by Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides soon expressed exasperation when Reno
repeatedly expanded the scope of Starr's investigation into matters
like the mishandling of personnel files at the White House, the
abrupt dismissal of employees of the White House travel office and
the truthfulness of statements made at a congressional hearing by
Bernard Nussbaum, the former White House counsel and ally of
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when Clinton won re-election Reno appeared to be in
trouble. For weeks he left her in limbo about whether he would keep
her on the job at the Justice Department, passing up opportunities
to state clearly that she had his support. White House aides said
privately that Clinton's advisers wanted to ease her out of the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Clinton's aides said they concluded that if the
president fired a popular attorney general, he would face powerful
attacks from Republicans in Congress, who delighted in her
decisions to open independent investigations of Clinton's Cabinet
officers.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, some of Clinton's aides expressed fears that ousting
Reno would allow Republicans to accuse the president of a Saturday
Night Massacre like the one that forced Attorney General Elliot
Richardson to resign rather than carry out President Richard M.
Nixon's order to fire Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox.
In a city like Washington, that's job security.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than any other attorney general, Janet Reno
has been bedeviled by the independent counsel law. In just five
years, she has ordered the appointment of seven independent
prosecutors and turned down requests for a number of others, and is
now considering two more investigations of Clinton administration
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Her decisions have, in turn, infuriated both the White House and
its Republican critics, and her tenure at the Justice Department
has been largely defined by how she has used _ or, to some, misused
_ the law.
</P>
<P>
   But in addition to being a constant source of political trouble
for Reno, the statute, enacted after Watergate to keep politics out
of high-level corruption cases, has probably helped Reno keep her
job, which she might have lost long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Following President Clinton's re-election in 1996, there was a
push by administration officials to get rid of her; they felt stung
by her quickness to appoint independent prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   But in the polarized arena of independent counsel politics, each
time either the Democrats or the Republicans seem ready to take aim
at Reno, they draw back, fearing a backlash against what could look
like attacks on the political independence of a popular attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, with White House officials barely concealing their
relief, Reno took the political heat again by refusing to seek an
independent prosecutor to examine Vice President Al Gore's campaign
finance activities. Reno's job once again seemed secure. There is
no longer any backstairs gossip that Clinton wants to dump her.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Republicans had little realistic hope of doing
anything about their frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., demanded Judiciary Committee hearings
into her reluctance to pursue investigations of campaign financing,
but there seemed little desire among his colleagues to summon Reno
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dynamics could shift again, and soon. Monday she
must decide whether an outside prosecutor should investigate
whether former White House deputy chief of staff Harold M. Ickes
lied to Congress about his dealings with the Teamsters Union, whose
financial support the Democrats were seeking in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And next week she must decide whether to pursue allegations that
Clinton and his aides illegally evaded federal election laws when
they spent millions of dollars of Democratic Party funds on
political advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department aides insist that Reno is unconcerned about
the impact of her decisions on her own job or political standing.

   Two men approach each other on a street. They quickly realize
they are on a collision course. The first man, reading the body
language of the second, steps to the right, then sees that the
second man, attempting the same maneuver but responding a split
second too late, has made the same move. The first man tacks the
other way, but the second man has beat him to it. In an exquisite
choreography of misinterpretation, the two men run right into each
other on an empty sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   A Freudian would have no trouble interpreting the event. The two
men, although they thought they were trying to avoid each other,
were driven into each other's arms by a subconscious sexual
attraction. Non-Freudians, however, would recognize the workings of
an iron law governing human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The law has no name. It could be called the Uncertainty
Principle, if Heisenberg did not own the trademark. But it needs no
name to hold sway. Wherever a plan is hatched based on rational
expectations of other people's expectations, it rears its head,
decreeing that the very result that the plan is designed to prevent
will in fact come to pass, quickly and inevitably. Put more
scientifically, expectation of an expectation alters the expected
expectation. Call it the Petard Principle.
</P>
<P>
   The Petard Principle has been in effect lately. Most recently,
it put the whammy on the Federal Reserve. The Fed, making a
rational assessment, judged that a possible slowdown in the economy
could be averted with a half-point cut in interest rates. Shrewder
voices at the Fed then attempted to ward off the evil work of the
Petard Principle. A half-point cut, they argued, would send the
message that the Fed was deeply concerned about an economic
slowdown, causing conditions in the financial markets to
deteriorate. The Fed settled on a quarter-point cut. Markets
deteriorated, forcing the Fed to announce a second quarter-point
cut Oct. 15, and a third cut Nov. 17. Trying to anticipate the
Petard effect, the Fed faked itself out.
</P>
<P>
   The Petard Principle is not an economic law. Its ambitions go
far beyond that. Consider the release of Bill Clinton's videotaped
testimony before the grand jury charged with looking into the
Monica Lewinsky matter. It was generally considered to be a dead
certainty that once the American people got a look at Clinton on
the stand, he would be finished. His behavior was advertised by
unnamed insiders as being ``un-presidential,'' or worse. Television
viewers expected to see a performance comparable to one of Charles
Manson's appearances before the California parole board. They
didn't (although Clinton's eyes did begin spinning in their sockets
when the word ``cigar'' came up). Skewed expectations produced a
skewed result.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Petard Principle at work again, with an interesting
twist. Who skewed the expectations? Credulous observers might
assume that it was the President's enemies who spread the word that
a career-ending performance was in store. Students of the Petard
Principle know that savvy presidential advisers would have been
working double overtime to broadcast the message that Clinton's
most shameful hour was at hand, thereby leveraging defeat into
victory. OK, not victory, but at this late date, Clinton and his
supporters will settle for low-grade embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts have sliced, diced and minced the results of
the Minnesota gubernatorial campaign, desperately trying to explain
how it is that one of the most enlightened and well-educated body
of citizens in the United States decided that a professional
wrestler with a shaved head should manage their affairs. It was the
Petard Principle. Every voting Minnesotan entered the booth
convinced that Jesse Ventura was a fringe candidate, and every vote
cast for Ventura was done in that what-the-heck spirit that keeps
so many Vegas wedding chapels busy. Every Ventura voter pulled the
lever fully confident that no more than a handful of his or her
fellow Minnesotans were doing the same. Surprise!
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, too, wrestles constantly with the powerful but sneaky
influence of the Petard Principle. Until this summer, the wise guys
thought they had it beat. Studying audience behavior, the studio
marketers saw that the mere expectation of a film's success could
help insure success. By marketing a film as though it were destined
to gross $80 million its first weekend, they could make audiences
believe that a film was already a hit, and that they had better
move fast and get it while it was hot.
</P>
<P>
   Like a smart virus, the Petard Principle adjusted. The summer of
1998 will be remembered as the season when the blockbusters
flopped. Nothing could have been bigger than ``Godzilla,'' either
the film itself, about a beast with a foot bigger than Donald
Trump's hat size, or its advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, audiences ran to ``Something About Mary,'' a film that
canny studio marketers recognized as having megahit potential _ it
has taken in more than $170 million at the box office so far _ but
chose to advertise almost as though it were a quirky independent
film. Faked out by an underplayed ad campaign, filmgoers nourished
the illusion that buying a ticket to the film made them part of a
small, independent-minded community making a creative choice.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like those Minnesota voters.

SUDDENLY, SADDAM FEELS ALONE IN THE ARAB WORLD

<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the uneasy calm that has followed President
Clinton's decision to call off the bombing of Iraq, diplomats
watching for Saddam Hussein's next move sense something profoundly
different in the Iraqi air. While clues do not add up to
conclusions, some Arab and Western experts have seen signs that
Saddam is more isolated in his own region than at any time since
his 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which drove fellow Arab nations into
backing the U.S.-led coalition in the subsequent Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling of Arab relations with Iraq has diverse causes.
Contributing to the trend is the finally tangible (however slow)
progress in peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
President Clinton's forceful and sustained role in the Wye
Plantation talks was widely noticed in Arab nations, a Mideast
envoy said. Relatively small events, like the opening last week of
the Palestinians' first international airport at Gaza, are ``a
tremendous psychological boost'' to better feelings about the
United States, the diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats say that Iraq appears to be convinced that Syria,
an old rival, has been lured by Washington into believing that its
concerns about Israel and its demand for a return of the Golan
Heights could be dealt with next. The subtext in the message is
that Syria would do well to distance itself from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, recent U.S. efforts to feel out Iran, however
tentative and cautious they have been, can be interpreted by Iraqis
as cover for the Iranians should they choose to make trouble for
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Even the collapse of world oil prices to the lowest level in a
decade plays a part in distancing the Arabs and Iranians from Iraq,
since other oil producers in the region are not eager to see Iraq
free to export petroleum at this point _ a principal Iraqi aim in
seeking a relaxation of United Nations sanctions. Iraq produced
3.14 million barrels a day in 1990 under an OPEC quota. Now,
although under strict U.N. regulation, Iraq has already averaged
2.4 million barrels a day over the last four months, and exports
about 1.8 millions barrels of it, an Iraqi oil ministry official
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But exasperation with Saddam's defiance of the United Nations,
fears that he will bring destabilizing destruction down on the
region by sooner or later provoking a U.S. attack, and concern for
the fate of the Iraqi people appear to be turning Arab opinion
against him. His willingness to push Iraqis into the range of U.S.
missiles and bombers has also disturbed some U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab people are able to separate their sympathy for Iraqis
from their attitudes toward Saddam,'' an Arab envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats wager that the Clinton administration may have
sensed this mounting disenchantment with Iraq and made it a
calculation in two decisions two weeks ago. The first was the
decision not to alienate Arabs anew by killing Iraqis after Saddam
appeared ready to capitulate and allow international inspectors to
work. The second was Clinton's public call to the Iraqi opposition
to overthrow Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Having to watch his back, is the Iraqi president now more
vulnerable at home? Western diplomats and officials who would like
to believe that he is say that, nevertheless, they have no strong
new evidence that he is in danger. Still, there is known to be some
dissent within the Iraqi army. ``Soldiers have families too and
they see what this man is doing to people,'' an exile who was
afraid to give his name said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how secure Saddam is arose in new force last
week when his second-in-command, Izzat Ibrahim, escaped
assassination in the southern Shiite city of Karbala. In the days
that followed, Iraqi newspapers hinted that Iran, with its Shiite
leadership and a centuries-long enmity with Sunni-led Iraq, might
have been behind the grenade throwers who tried to kill Ibrahim,
the president's deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council. Iraq
had been trying to build better relations and more commercial ties
with Iran, as it has been doing with Arab nations. The success of
those ventures appears to be mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For several days last week, Iraqi leaders and the controlled
Iraqi media were pleading openly with the Arab world not to abandon
Iraq ``and damage the Arab nation.'' The call came, diplomats said,
as the importance of an Arab warning to Saddam several weeks ago
began to sink in. On Nov. 12, two days before Iraq withdrew its ban
on arms inspections, eight Arab nations _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Syria among them _ said in a public statement that resounded around
the Middle East that if the Americans struck, Saddam would bear the
responsibility for exposing the Iraqi people to new levels of
misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arabs have a strange relationship with Iraq,'' a Middle
Eastern diplomat said. In 1990, after the invasion of Kuwait, a
summit meeting of Arab leaders in effect gave the go-ahead to the
U.S.-led coalition to wage war on Iraq. But Arab nations, most of
which have authoritarian governments that are wary of coups and
revolutionary movements, have always stopped short (at least
publicly) of advocating the overthrow of Saddam. The idea of a
Western nation, the United States or Britain, ousting an Arab
leader is inflammatory in itself, and stirs up too much history.
</P>

   Last week, however, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was not
afraid to talk about a change of regime in Iraq as long as it came
from within and not from British and U.S. intelligence agencies.
``Let's be realistic,'' Mubarak said in an interview with the
French newspaper Le Figaro. ``These projects won't get anywhere.
Anyone who knows Iraq knows that no action will succeed if it isn't
led from the interior, by people living in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   A European diplomat said that the world was probably still far
from seeing any organized resistance emerge in Iraq to topple
Saddam, at least not in a decisive way. More likely, some Western
experts fear, would be a messy collapse into brutality _ ``like the
end of Ceaucescu in Romania,'' a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no orderly succession evident. Saddam has
allowed no other Iraqi to build a political base. His two sons,
Uday and Qusay, are by wide agreement despised. Abbas Mehdi, an
exile who is active in democratic Iraqi dissident movements in the
United States, said that if Saddam were to die today, naturally or
violently, ``Within 30 minutes, his sons would be chopped into
10,000 pieces.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In the uneasy calm that has followed President
Clinton's decision to call off the bombing of Iraq, diplomats
watching for Saddam Hussein's next move sense something profoundly
different in the Iraqi air. While clues do not add up to
conclusions, some Arab and Western experts have seen signs that
Saddam is more isolated in his own region than at any time since
his 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which drove fellow Arab nations into
backing the U.S.-led coalition in the subsequent Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling of Arab relations with Iraq has diverse causes.
Contributing to the trend is the finally tangible (however slow)
progress in peace agreements between Israel and the Palestinians.
President Clinton's forceful and sustained role in the Wye
Plantation talks was widely noticed in Arab nations, a Mideast
envoy said. Relatively small events, like the opening last week of
the Palestinians' first international airport at Gaza, are ``a
tremendous psychological boost'' to better feelings about the
United States, the diplomat added.
</P>
<P>
   Arab diplomats say that Iraq appears to be convinced that Syria,
an old rival, has been lured by Washington into believing that its
concerns about Israel and its demand for a return of the Golan
Heights could be dealt with next. The subtext in the message is
that Syria would do well to distance itself from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, recent U.S. efforts to feel out Iran, however
tentative and cautious they have been, can be interpreted by Iraqis
as cover for the Iranians should they choose to make trouble for
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Even the collapse of world oil prices to the lowest level in a
decade plays a part in distancing the Arabs and Iranians from Iraq,
since other oil producers in the region are not eager to see Iraq
free to export petroleum at this point _ a principal Iraqi aim in
seeking a relaxation of United Nations sanctions. Iraq produced
3.14 million barrels a day in 1990 under an OPEC quota. Now,
although under strict U.N. regulation, Iraq has already averaged
2.4 million barrels a day over the last four months, and exports
about 1.8 millions barrels of it, an Iraqi oil ministry official
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But exasperation with Saddam's defiance of the United Nations,
fears that he will bring destabilizing destruction down on the
region by sooner or later provoking a U.S. attack, and concern for
the fate of the Iraqi people appear to be turning Arab opinion
against him. His willingness to push Iraqis into the range of U.S.
missiles and bombers has also disturbed some U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arab people are able to separate their sympathy for Iraqis
from their attitudes toward Saddam,'' an Arab envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats wager that the Clinton administration may have
sensed this mounting disenchantment with Iraq and made it a
calculation in two decisions two weeks ago. The first was the
decision not to alienate Arabs anew by killing Iraqis after Saddam
appeared ready to capitulate and allow international inspectors to
work. The second was Clinton's public call to the Iraqi opposition
to overthrow Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Having to watch his back, is the Iraqi president now more
vulnerable at home? Western diplomats and officials who would like
to believe that he is say that, nevertheless, they have no strong
new evidence that he is in danger. Still, there is known to be some
dissent within the Iraqi army. ``Soldiers have families too and
they see what this man is doing to people,'' an exile who was
afraid to give his name said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The question of how secure Saddam is arose in new force last
week when his second-in-command, Izzat Ibrahim, escaped
assassination in the southern Shiite city of Karbala. In the days
that followed, Iraqi newspapers hinted that Iran, with its Shiite
leadership and a centuries-long enmity with Sunni-led Iraq, might
have been behind the grenade throwers who tried to kill Ibrahim,
the president's deputy on the Revolutionary Command Council. Iraq
had been trying to build better relations and more commercial ties
with Iran, as it has been doing with Arab nations. The success of
those ventures appears to be mixed.
</P>
<P>
   For several days last week, Iraqi leaders and the controlled
Iraqi media were pleading openly with the Arab world not to abandon
Iraq ``and damage the Arab nation.'' The call came, diplomats said,
as the importance of an Arab warning to Saddam several weeks ago
began to sink in. On Nov. 12, two days before Iraq withdrew its ban
on arms inspections, eight Arab nations _ Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Syria among them _ said in a public statement that resounded around
the Middle East that if the Americans struck, Saddam would bear the
responsibility for exposing the Iraqi people to new levels of
misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Arabs have a strange relationship with Iraq,'' a Middle
Eastern diplomat said. In 1990, after the invasion of Kuwait, a
summit meeting of Arab leaders in effect gave the go-ahead to the
U.S.-led coalition to wage war on Iraq. But Arab nations, most of
which have authoritarian governments that are wary of coups and
revolutionary movements, have always stopped short (at least
publicly) of advocating the overthrow of Saddam. The idea of a
Western nation, the United States or Britain, ousting an Arab
leader is inflammatory in itself, and stirs up too much history.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, however, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak was not
afraid to talk about a change of regime in Iraq as long as it came
from within and not from British and U.S. intelligence agencies.
``Let's be realistic,'' Mubarak said in an interview with the
French newspaper Le Figaro. ``These projects won't get anywhere.
Anyone who knows Iraq knows that no action will succeed if it isn't

from seeing any organized resistance emerge in Iraq to topple
Saddam, at least not in a decisive way. More likely, some Western
experts fear, would be a messy collapse into brutality _ ``like the
end of Ceaucescu in Romania,'' a diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is no orderly succession evident. Saddam has
allowed no other Iraqi to build a political base. His two sons,
Uday and Qusay, are by wide agreement despised. Abbas Mehdi, an
exile who is active in democratic Iraqi dissident movements in the

   BERLIN _ Germany is whole and free. The Allied and Russian
troops have long since left Berlin. Next year, with Poland's entry
into NATO, the country will be surrounded by allies for the first
time in its modern history, and the German parliament will return
to the Reichstag. A cycle has been completed, it would seem, a
chapter closed, 53 years after the fall of Hitler's Reich.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Germany is anything but tranquil at the dawn of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's rule. In recent weeks, a former
president, leading writers and prominent Jews have been drawn into
a fierce debate about the place of memory and the shame, if any,
that young Germans should feel for the crimes of their forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has broached such issues before, but in its scope,
openness and vitriol, the discussion appears to be without
precedent. Behind it lies a growing exasperation at what is seen by
some as a commercial exploitation of the Holocaust. Also apparent
are a thirst for normality in a society that has repeatedly tried
to confront Auschwitz and anxiety over freedom of speech in what is
an established democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps, in the long run, it is good that a debate has been
engendered, however painful,'' said Fritz Stern, a history
professor at Columbia University. ``For always, beneath the
surface, there has been the wish to be normal in Germany, the wish
not to be reminded all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began in October when Martin Walser, a prominent
writer, used an acceptance speech for Germany's top literary award
to say something that he said made him ``tremble'' at his audacity:
Auschwitz should not become a ``routine threat, a tool of
intimidation, a moral cudgel or just a compulsory exercise.'' Nor,
he added, should German shame be ``exploited for present
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Response was overwhelming and electric because the challenge
came not from the rightist fringe but from a man of the
intellectual and moral center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mental arson,'' declared Ignatz Bubis, the leader of Germany's
small but growing Jewish community, who accused Walser of
encouraging neo-Nazi groups, stimulating a new intellectual
nationalism and betraying the memory of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Rushing to Walser's defense, the writer Monika Maron said that
he had not gone far enough. ``I, for my part, neither think nor
feel that young Germans must carry the shame of their nation,'' she
wrote in the newspaper Die Zeit. ``For me, young Germans are as
little incriminated as young Danes or young French.''
</P>
<P>
   She wondered how ``we can convince other countries of our
normality if we ourselves deny that claim?''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maron ended with a troubling confession: ``Now that I defend
Walser, I am also trembling a little bit. Why? Where do I live that
I am afraid even to say what I think?''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 1945, Germany has been a country where the voicing of
nationalist, or even strongly patriotic, sentiment has been
suspect, and freedom of expression in mainstream debate has not
extended to questioning ``the exploitation'' of the Holocaust.
Perhaps Germany is only now lifting the last taboos bequeathed by
Hitler and going through the final throes of its confrontation with
Hitler's Reich.
</P>
<P>
   After the death camps, after the destruction of European Jewry,
Germany has more recently been dealing with the issues of slave
labor at many of its corporations and the cooperation of many banks
and insurance companies with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The taboos have all been lifted at last, and the complicity of
most sectors of German society revealed,'' said Arno Mayer, a
historian at Princeton University. ``But once you do that, of
course, you want to move forward, get beyond it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the very moment when this desire to move on has
apparently crystallized, the Holocaust has become more omnipresent
than ever, brought to the public by the movie ``Schindler's List,''
popularized in American television series, argued over in claims
against Swiss banks and used as a regular ingredient of New York
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans' growing belief that American popular culture has
turned the Holocaust into the sole event of World War II and their
sharpened desire to put a terrible century behind them seem to lie
at the heart of the current furor.
</P>
<P>
   Walser was careful not to say who was doing the exploiting. But
in another long defense of him, Klaus von Dohnanyi, a former mayor
of Hamburg and a man whose own father was killed by the Nazis
because of his acts of resistance, was explicit.
</P>
<P>
   He singled out U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who helped
force the Swiss to settle Jewish claims, as an example of the
``political instrumentalization'' of the Holocaust, complained of a
``Holocaust industry'' and suggested that visitors to concentration
camps today increasingly seemed driven by idle curiosity.
``Remembrance must not become comfortable routine,'' von Dohnanyi
said. ``This is the danger Walser came out against.''
</P>
<P>
   Von Dohnanyi also compared his own situation with that of Bubis,
the Jewish leader. Relatives of both men were killed by the Nazis.
Both bore no responsibility for these crimes. Yet, there the
similarities ended. While Bubis was naturally, and rightfully,
exonerated, von Dohnanyi felt compelled to accept the ``historic
guilt'' of the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   This was naturally a difficult role, and von Dohnyanyi said
Walser's speech should be seen as the ``complaint of a personally
innocent German, who feels caught in the disgrace of crimes of
preceding generations which he did not commit, but for which he
nevertheless has to feel responsible. It was the understandable,
even necessary complaint of a conscientious non-Jewish German about
the difficult fate of being such a German today.''
</P>
<P>
   But when, if ever, will that fate become a lighter one? Perhaps
the very fact of so open a debate suggests a society that is
opening up and outgrowing its fears.
</P>
<P>
   The resentments alluded to by Walser are widespread _ he has
received enormous support _ and could grow sharper if the new
government or the European Union fail to offer Germans the more
unburdened identity they clearly crave.
</P>
<P>
   One man clearly worried is former President Richard von
Weizsacker. Writing in the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung last
week, he accused Walser of ``cutting provocation,'' warning that,
``It must not go on like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The voice was authoritative but with a ring of the past. Germany
seems to want to talk about its demons, once and for all.

 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When their gleaming new international airport opened
in the Gaza Strip last week, Palestinians saw it as one more step
toward the national statehood their leaders have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening Monday morning in Washington of a U.S.-sponsored
gathering of international aid donors to the Palestinians is a
reminder of how far they have to go before assuming real control
over their affairs _ and of the peculiar challenges of running a
non-state state that hovers limbo-like between dependence and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian National Authority, midwifed into existence five
years ago by the Oslo peace negotiators, has effective internal
jurisdiction over an expanding territory. It polices streets,
patrols borders, runs schools and hospitals, manages ministries of
trade and finance and foreign affairs. But it isn't in charge of
its own destiny _ or finances.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact of a ``donor's conference'' hosted by a foreign
government highlights the limits of the Authority's authority. A
poor country in need of aid would directly petition multilateral
lenders and friendly governments, as hurricane-ravaged Honduras is
now doing. But the Palestinian National Authority has no
independent standing in the multilateral agencies, and no formal
diplomatic relations with major Western aid donors. And it has few
immediate prospects of commercial funding.
</P>
<P>
   Convened by the Clinton administration, Monday's meeting is
intended to secure firm pledges of multibillion-dollar support for
the Palestinian National Authority over the next three to five
years. After Oslo, it was assumed that by 1999 the Palestinians
would achieve something close to full sovereignty, and foreign
assistance promised in late 1993 for an envisioned five-year
transition is now running out.
</P>
<P>
   But now, under pressure from the United States, Palestinian
leaders have backed away from their long-announced intention to
proclaim statehood next May. And Israeli negotiators are talking
about postponing any final Palestinian declaration of independence
for several years more, as discussions continue on security issues,
the repatriation of refugees, and the heatedly disputed ``final
status'' of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the Palestinian National Authority, meanwhile,
remains unchanged. Still subsumed economically within the state of
Israel, it cannot print money, impose import duties, draw down
loans from the International Monetary Fund, or float notes in the
sovereign bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   There are of course some advantages to international financial
virginity. There is no vulnerable local currency for London traders
to attack, no massive foreign debt to service, no IMF budget
overlord to placate. But this is the Middle East, the birthplace of
the double-edged sword. And it is the era of trade, not aid, when
the engines of world capitalism are expected to drive progress.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually in the developing world, the Palestinians have no
legacy of binge borrowing or debt defaults. This may sound like an
unalloyed blessing, but that is not how things work in global
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every tiny Third World capital there is a cluster
of Western bankers doggedly seeking some sliver of profit, some
credible investment opportunity, no matter how checkered the local
financial history. But you don't find dealmakers from Morgan
Guaranty hanging around the juice bars of Gaza City, or Ramallah.
The Palestinian National Authority is not unlike a steadily
employed, bill-paying consumer who has carefully avoided mortgages
and Visa cards but suddenly needs a loan. To a banker, this is a
non-person.
</P>
<P>
   Even for an incipient nation-state, having no credit history is
worse than having a bad credit history. Making matters harder
still, the Palestinians have no dollar reserves or other sovereign
assets to act as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   So for the moment the Palestinians have little choice but to go
to Washington, kaffiyeh in hand, and hope for more aid. In the
Monday conference the Clinton administration is expected to
increase U.S. funding, perhaps doubling it to some $150 million
yearly; the European Union nations _ by far the biggest donors _
have pledged a new multi-year package of $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But even giving money away gets complicated when the recipient
is not yet a government.
</P>
<P>
   The European Investment Bank promised $300 million to the
Palestinians five years ago, but has delivered not a penny, as it
tries to find a way around its own requirements for repayment
assurances from a sovereign borrower. The U.S. Overseas Private
Investment Corp. pledged $125 million in credit guarantees to
American business ventures in Gaza and the West Bank, but has
provided a scant $6 million, in good part because there is no
history of U.S. corporate investment under a Palestinian regime.
</P>
<P>
   Atypically of Third World aid programs, most funding for
Palestinian programs bypasses local authorities entirely and goes
to projects managed by the donors themselves. The United Nations
alone has 26 different agencies dispensing aid and running
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Palestinians welcome the aid, they find its
distribution suffocatingly paternalistic.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for Palestinian self-determination is often portrayed
as an issue of national pride, of rewards that are more psychic and
symbolic than hard-headedly practical. But for Anis al-Qaq, the
Palestinian National Authority deputy minister who oversees foreign
assistance receipts, achieving something closer to national status
is above all a managerial imperative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States and others should look at the Palestinian
Authority as a state,'' he said, ``so that they can leave us to
cope with our deficits and our financial planning by ourselves.''

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ When their gleaming new international airport opened
in the Gaza Strip last week, Palestinians saw it as one more step
toward the national statehood their leaders have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   But the opening Monday morning in Washington of a U.S.-sponsored
gathering of international aid donors to the Palestinians is a
reminder of how far they have to go before assuming real control
over their affairs _ and of the peculiar challenges of running a
non-state state that hovers limbo-like between dependence and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian National Authority, midwifed into existence five
years ago by the Oslo peace negotiators, has effective internal
jurisdiction over an expanding territory. It polices streets,
patrols borders, runs schools and hospitals, manages ministries of
trade and finance and foreign affairs. But it isn't in charge of
its own destiny _ or finances.
</P>
<P>
   The very fact of a ``donor's conference'' hosted by a foreign
government highlights the limits of the Authority's authority. A
poor country in need of aid would directly petition multilateral
lenders and friendly governments, as hurricane-ravaged Honduras is
now doing. But the Palestinian National Authority has no
independent standing in the multilateral agencies, and no formal
diplomatic relations with major Western aid donors. And it has few
immediate prospects of commercial funding.
</P>
<P>
   Convened by the Clinton administration, Monday's meeting is
intended to secure firm pledges of multibillion-dollar support for
the Palestinian National Authority over the next three to five
years. After Oslo, it was assumed that by 1999 the Palestinians
would achieve something close to full sovereignty, and foreign
assistance promised in late 1993 for an envisioned five-year
transition is now running out.
</P>
<P>
   But now, under pressure from the United States, Palestinian
leaders have backed away from their long-announced intention to
proclaim statehood next May. And Israeli negotiators are talking
about postponing any final Palestinian declaration of independence
for several years more, as discussions continue on security issues,
the repatriation of refugees, and the heatedly disputed ``final
status'' of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the Palestinian National Authority, meanwhile,
remains unchanged. Still subsumed economically within the state of
Israel, it cannot print money, impose import duties, draw down
loans from the International Monetary Fund, or float notes in the
sovereign bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   There are of course some advantages to international financial
virginity. There is no vulnerable local currency for London traders
to attack, no massive foreign debt to service, no IMF budget
overlord to placate. But this is the Middle East, the birthplace of
the double-edged sword. And it is the era of trade, not aid, when
the engines of world capitalism are expected to drive progress.
</P>
<P>
   Unusually in the developing world, the Palestinians have no
legacy of binge borrowing or debt defaults. This may sound like an
unalloyed blessing, but that is not how things work in global
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually every tiny Third World capital there is a cluster
of Western bankers doggedly seeking some sliver of profit, some
credible investment opportunity, no matter how checkered the local
financial history. But you don't find dealmakers from Morgan
Guaranty hanging around the juice bars of Gaza City, or Ramallah.
The Palestinian National Authority is not unlike a steadily
employed, bill-paying consumer who has carefully avoided mortgages
and Visa cards but suddenly needs a loan. To a banker, this is a
non-person.
</P>
<P>
   Even for an incipient nation-state, having no credit history is
worse than having a bad credit history. Making matters harder
still, the Palestinians have no dollar reserves or other sovereign
assets to act as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   So for the moment the Palestinians have little choice but to go
to Washington, kaffiyeh in hand, and hope for more aid. In the

</P>
<P>
   JEWS-SETTLE-DISPUTE _ A battle is flaring between Jewish
humanitarian groups, plaintiffs' lawyers and concentration camp
survivors over the $1.25 billion paid by Swiss banks to settle
Holocaust-related lawsuits, and potentially billions more from
claims against companies in Germany, Austria and other countries.
By Barry Meier. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   JEWS-SETTLE-MONEY _ Two of the Jewish groups that may play a
major role in distributing money from the Swiss banks' settlement
have had problems in the past getting aid quickly to aging
Holocaust survivors. By Barry Meier.
</P>
<P>
   YUGO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ In moves viewed here and
by some in Washington as signs of weakness rather than strength,
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has conducted an
extraordinary purge of his innermost circle, dismissing the leaders
of the army, the air force and the intelligence service, as well as
one of his most trusted political commissars. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-CONGO (Paris) _ Leaders of Congo and neighboring
countries giving support to armed rebels in the central African
country agreed Saturday under U.N. auspices to sign a cease-fire
agreement by mid-December, French President Jacques Chirac said. By
Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PETERSBURG (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ Murder has become
commonplace here. Such lawlessness is not uncommon in the rest of
the country, but in this graceful city, which prides itself on
preserving Russia's cultural heritage and the purity of its
pre-Communist language, the new reputation as a capital of crime
sits hard. By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTLAND-NATIONALISM (Glasgow, Scotland) _ The Scottish
Nationalist Party has until now been thought more relevant to
Brigadoon than to Britain. But now, with Alex Salmond, 43, a
onetime banker amply endowed with cheeky cultural references and
sound bites, at their helm, and with new political power coming
here from the British Parliament in London, the Nationalists are
seriously challenging the Labor Party's traditional domination of
Scotland. By Warren Hoge. (With photo and map.)
</P>
<P>
   SWISS-DRUG-VOTE (Geneva) _ The Swiss are voting Sunday on
whether to legalize everything from marijuana to heroin and
cocaine, a measure which _ if passed _ would give Switzerland the
most sweeping decriminalization of drug use, possession and
production in Europe. By Elizabeth Olsen.
</P>
<P>
   ARGENTINA-SPAIN (Buenos Aires, Argentina) _ Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former Chilean dictator, is only one of several
former South American strongmen being investigated by a Spanish
judge for possible extradition to Spain. Another is a retired
Argentine admiral, Emilio E. Massera, who was the chief ideologue
of the military junta that took power in 1976 and also supervisor
of the most notorious secret detention center in Argentina. By
Clifford Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-HUNTING-SUIT (Kankani, India) _ The Bishnoi villagers of
Kankani have become national heroes in an ecological morality play
that pits simple farmers against an Indian movie idol loathsomely
playing against type. By Barry Bearak. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-AFFIRM-ACTION _ The longstanding debate over affirmative
action in education, for years centered on universities and
professional schools, is shifting down to public school districts,
where an increasing number of parents _ mostly white _ are
complaining about policies they say are unfair to their children.
By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   TEENS-PLASTIC-SURGERY _ A tide of affluent baby boomers are
being tucked, peeled and augmented as never before. But it is the
teen-age girls now flocking to the suites of plastic surgeons from
Park Avenue to Beverly Hills who pose an ethical problem for
doctors who must decide whether to operate on patients who are too
young to vote, but old enough to feel social pressures to be
physically perfect. By Jane Gross.
</P>
<P>
   TRITIUM-SHORTAGE (Washington) _ A potential shortage of tritium,
a crucial ingredient of every nuclear weapon, has prompted the
Department of Energy to announce within three weeks whether it will
recommend starting one of the department's rare public-works style
projects to manufacture more of the radioactive gas. By Matthew L.
Wald.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-ARCHIVES _ Boston was threatened by smallpox, and from
his nearby headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., George Washington
ordered his troops to stay out of the city. It was March 19, 1776,
and the orders were written by hand. This letter and hundreds of
others in their original form can be read on the Internet at the
American Memory site of the Library of Congress, one of the
libraries leading the way in a quiet revolution that is changing
the way knowledge is shared around the world. By Jo Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   AMERINDIAN-PREP-SCHOOL _ One hundred years ago, after the
conquest of the West, American Indian schools were founded to
encourage assimilation and stamp out indigenous culture. In the
second half of this century, American Indian schools took the
opposite approach, emphasizing their students' heritage. Neither
approach fostered academic success. Now, one of the most unusual
boarding schools in the country marries both approaches. Modeled
after East Coast boarding schools that prepare students for Ivy
League colleges, the Native American Preparatory School in Rowe,
N.M., prepares gifted Indian students, most of whom grew up in
poverty on reservations, to walk in two worlds, tribal and
academic. By Jane Salodof.
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIA-HEALTH (Washington) _ Residents of Appalachia, one of
the poorest areas of the country, are more likely to die from heart
disease than people living elsewhere, a new study by researchers at
West Virginia University has found. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-TRAIL-DISPUTE (Bishop, Calif.) _ Horse packers blazed many
of the trails that pierce the dense pine forests of the Sierra
backcountry, and since early this century they have been carrying
sightseers and fishermen into the range's high reaches. But now
packers are locked in a dispute with hikers and environmentalists
over their access to some of California's best known wilderness
areas.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO-HAIR-LAWSUIT (Canton, Ohio) _ Four African-American hair

are unfair and burdensome licensing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-ICKES (Washington) _ In his three years serving
President Clinton as staff trouble shooter and campaign financing
strategist, Harold M. Ickes became enough of a lightning rod that
he had to undergo 26 separate sessions of questioning under oath by
investigators of the Republican-controlled Congress and the
independent counsel, Kenneth Starr. Now the former White House
deputy chief of staff finds fate and fortune hinging on one single,
brief response he offered to a question in one of his 26 bouts of
testimony. By Francis X. Clines. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-SOFTMONEY (Washington) _ Soft money is bleeding into
the presidential campaign earlier than ever before and spreading
among more potential candidates. And these controversial big
donations are being solicited directly by the potential candidates
for their own political committees, while in the past soft money
was funneled through the national political parties. By Jill
Abramson.
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-HOUSING (Washington) _ With Thanksgiving weekend as a
backdrop, President Clinton on Saturday highlighted two new housing
programs that will provide $822 million for low-income people who
are elderly or disabled. By Michael Janofsky.

<P>
   FBN-FALCON-FEVER (Atlanta) _ This city has never really loved
them, not the way Cleveland used to love its Browns, when it had
them, or the way Pittsburgh loves the Steelers, and certainly not
the way Green Bay loves its Packers. But then, as the cliche goes,
it is easy to love a winner, even if the trophies have dust on
them. By Rick Bragg. (With a photo.)

 By BARRY MEIER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A battle is flaring among Jewish humanitarian groups,
plaintiffs' lawyers and concentration-camp survivors over the $1.25
billion paid by Swiss banks to settle Holocaust-related lawsuits,
and potentially billions more from claims against companies in
Germany, Austria and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the dispute is the emotionally charged question
of how to divide the bulk of that settlement, because only a small
fraction of it will go to the heirs of Jews who had Swiss bank
accounts on the eve of World War II and were killed by the Nazis.
As a result, up to $1 billion may remain.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Jewish charitable groups have prepared
competing proposals to distribute that portion of the fund, plans
that could give them a major stake in the allocation and bolster
their influence in the Jewish world. But some lawyers and survivors
are arguing that the money should be paid directly to those who
suffered.
</P>
<P>
   The success in the Swiss case has also spurred lawyers
experienced in large class-action suits to pursue a wave of
lawsuits against banks and insurers in other European countries and
against manufacturers like Ford, Volkswagen and Siemens, which are
accused of profiting from forced labor during World War II. Those
suits could yield billions of dollars more in settlements and tens
of millions in lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, competing lawyers from the United States have
barnstormed across Europe soliciting clients, publicly castigating
one another and privately maneuvering to oust their adversaries.
And the World Jewish Congress, which helped instigate the Swiss
bank case, recently met with political and corporate leaders in
Austria and Germany to warn that peace can be purchased only
through reparations.
</P>
<P>
   But as the disputes widen, a campaign once fired by moral
outrage may be dissolving into a battle over power and money. Some
now fear that aging survivors with few years left could again be
victimized, this time by those claiming to fight in their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want an industry to be made on the memory of victims,
particularly because there are so few survivors out there who will
benefit from it,'' said Abraham Foxman, national director of the
Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust-related claims are growing rapidly. Michael Bazyler, a
professor at Whittier Law School in California, said that in the
five decades before the Swiss settlement in 1996, fewer than a
dozen such suits had been filed. The number has tripled since then,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers pursing the suits say their goal is simple: to right
historical wrongs and render a final accounting for one of
humanity's greatest crimes. Implicit in such a reckoning, they say,
are such difficult questions as who speaks for the millions who
perished.
</P>
<P>
   ``These lawsuits will complete a picture of the Holocaust that
has never before been fully developed about the willing accomplices
and companies that stood behind the direct participants,'' said
Michael Hausfeld, a class-action lawyer from Washington who reached
a landmark $140 million settlement with Texaco in 1996 over racial
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The roots of today's tensions go back to 1995, when the World
Jewish Congress, a New York-based group led by Edgar Bronfman Sr.,
and Rabbi Israel Singer, the group's secretary-general, started the
political uproar against the Swiss banks. They argued that the
banks had failed to check properly for accounts opened by Jews who
perished in the Holocaust, and that the banks might be still
holding billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, suits were filed by competing lawyers. One camp
was headed by Hausfeld and two other well-known lawyers, Melvyn
Weiss of New York and Martin Mendelsohn of Washington, who were
aligned with the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles and sought
backing from other Jewish groups.
</P>
<P>
   The other legal camp was led by Edward Fagan, a former
personal-injury lawyer from New York with a street fighter's style
who has garnered publicity and criticism for holding vigils with
Holocaust survivors outside companies that are targets of his
suits. That group said it represented the views of individual
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   The factions fought furiously. For example, Weiss and his
allies, who have worked on the Swiss case pro bono, asserted that
Fagan's group simply wanted to settle the case cheaply so they
could collect their fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two teams were spending their time denigrating each other,
their ability, parentage, ethnic heritage, you name it,'' said Burt
Neuborne, a professor at New York University Law School who
originally entered the fray on Fagan's side but has since become
aligned with Hausfeld's group.
</P>
<P>
   The World Jewish Congress also apparently viewed the lawyers and
groups like the Wiesenthal Center as latecomers to its party. Weiss
said that when he asked Elan Steinberg, a World Jewish Congress
official, to join a 1996 meeting of Jewish leaders at the offices
of his law firm in Manhattan, Steinberg appeared to give the group
the cold shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he had come only out of respect,'' said Weiss. ``He
stood there with his arms folded and waved us off as though we were
intruding on turf that they had already covered.''
</P>
<P>
   But before long, these conflicts were temporarily resolved by
others. The competing suits were consolidated before Judge Edward
Korman of U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, and Swiss negotiators
eager to resolve the legal and political aspects of their quandary
insisted that the World Jewish Congress take part with plaintiffs'
lawyers in settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   The result was the $1.25 billion settlement in August, twice the
sum offered by the Swiss banks just a few months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the alliances of convenience formed during the settlement
talks quickly frayed, setting the stage for the current battle.
</P>
<P>
   One issue was who would control the rising number of claims.
Singer, who is chief strategist at the World Jewish Congress, has
said a wave of such claims could yield billions in settlement
funds. That prospect was not lost on the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   By last year, the two legal camps were again filing competing
suits. And this time, the faction led by Hausfeld and Weiss said
they would also seek to be paid legal fees, rather than working pro
bono.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, competing lawyers have crisscrossed Europe and
Israel to sign up clients. Fagan has recently traveled to Austria,
Germany and Hungary. And late last month, plaintiffs' lawyers
aligned with the Wiesenthal Center flew to Paris, where they
appeared on a radio program to publicize their suit against French
banks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The increasing invasion by Jewish groups and plaintiffs' lawyers
from the United States has made some European Jews uncomfortable.
And some European historians who have worked on slave-labor issues,
for example, have rebuffed efforts by lawyers from the United
States seeking alliances with them.
</P>
<P>
   The legal fighting has also reached a fevered pitch. Two law
firms that once sided with Fagan recently broke some of those ties
and joined with Weiss' group. In court papers filed earlier this
month, one of the lawyers involved, Robert Lieff, cited a fax in
which Fagan referred to leaders of the World Jewish Congress as
``pigs,'' adding that the lawyer took an equally ``crude and overly
competitive'' approach to those he perceived ``as competing for
glory in Holocaust cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Neuborne, the New York University professor, also jumped into
the fray. In a filing, he stated that he would oppose a large award
of legal fees to Fagan in the Swiss banks case because he did not
believe he deserved it. He also said in the same papers that
Fagan's ``property interest'' in Holocaust lawsuits threatened to
turn survivors into ``chattel to be acquired by entrepreneurial
lawyers bent on making a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own filing earlier this month, Fagan accused adversaries
like Lieff and Weiss of scheming, among other things, to steal his
clients and undermine his lawsuits, in order to gain control of
Holocaust cases and resulting profits for themselves. In an
interview, he also said that lawyers like Lieff wanted the backing
of major Jewish groups as a means of accomplishing that end.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fight over dead people's money, that's what it is,''
Fagan said. ``And I think survivors should be the ones making
decisions about where their parents' money should go.''
</P>
<P>
   While the lawyers bicker, the World Jewish Congress has also
been seeking a central role in the claims.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg, the executive director, said the group had taken that
position because the World Jewish Restitution Organization, an
affiliate, is empowered by the Israeli government to represent
Jewish interests on Holocaust-related matters. That group, like the
Congress, is headed by Bronfman and Singer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fundamental principle is that the victimized parties are
Holocaust survivors and the Jewish people as a whole,'' Steinberg
said, ``and we have been mandated to represent them.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, for example, Singer met with Chancellor Viktor Klima
of Austria at the home of a former chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, to
discuss possible restitution by companies in Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Singer also said that he and a prominent German Jew, Ignatz
Bubis, who is an official of the World Jewish Congress, were
involved in talks started last month between Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder of Germany and top business leaders seeking to develop a
unified response to dozens of suits.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the World Jewish Restitution Organization also met
this month at Bronfman's office in Manhattan to discuss another
issue: how to distribute the Swiss funds.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposal being developed by the group, about 80 percent
of the funds would go to needy survivors, either through direct
payments or through charitable services by groups like those in the
World Jewish Restitution Organization, said Bobby Brown, the
adviser for Diaspora Affairs to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
of Israel. The remaining 20 percent would be marked for
Holocaust-related educational programs and research.
</P>
<P>
   But some survivors and others say all the funds left after
payments to the heirs of Swiss account holders should go directly
to survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is for the survivors,'' said Estelle Sapir, a Holocaust
survivor from Far Rockaway, who sued Swiss banks on behalf of her
father, who died in a Polish camp. ``Not the organizations, not the
lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said that using criteria like financial need may create
legal problems because the Swiss suits were filed as class actions
without regard to financial status.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Neuborne, say they worry that creating
bureaucracies might delay payments to survivors in their last
years. Estimates on the number of Holocaust survivors vary, but it
may be at least 350,000, with an average age of 80.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jewish groups, like one representing the Orthodox Satmar
sect in Brooklyn, also expect to make proposals for how the money
should be spent. In an effort to prevent a long legal clash over
the issue, those involved in the Swiss bank case asked Korman
earlier this month to appoint an outside lawyer to review the
competing proposals when they are submitted to the court in several
months and to make a recommendation.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ The Turkish novelist Orhan Pamuk remembers
that when he was growing up in the 1950s and '60s, there was one
sure way to end any argument about how to do something: ``You just
had to say `This is how they do it in Europe' and that was final.
If things were done a certain way in Europe, then by definition
that was the right way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   For generations, even for centuries, Turks have debated how to
relate to Europe and, by extension, the Western world. It was
fundamental for Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who founded the Turkish
Republic in 1923, that Turkey was a European nation and should
strive to be ever more so. But the marriage of Turkish and European
values has not proven easy to consummate, and in recent weeks it
has been set back again, this time by a dispute over the fugitive
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Most Turks consider Ocalan a paragon of evil who combines the
most despicable qualities of Hitler and Caligula. After he was
arrested in Italy on Nov. 12, the prospect of him being brought
home in chains sent Turks into paroxysms of ecstasy.
</P>
<P>
   Italians, however, refused to extradite him. They said they
could not because their constitution forbids extraditing anyone to
countries that practice the death penalty. Several Italian
politicians also noted that European accords forbid sending
criminal suspects to places where they might face torture. Armando
Cossuta, whose Party of Italian Communists is part of the ruling
coalition, went so far as to call Ocalan ``the leader of an
oppressed people.''
</P>
<P>
   Turks were furious, saying Italy was embracing terrorism and
threatening to punish it with economic boycotts. Their outrage may
have been justified, but to Europeans it seemed strident and
immature. ``Any undue pressure on the Italian government, including
unilateral threats, is inappropriate and must be avoided,'' sniffed
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
   Many Europeans sympathize with the Kurds as a stateless people
victimized by a succession of empires, kingdoms and nations. Some
have allowed this sympathy to lead them to support for Ocalan's
Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. They see it as a liberation
movement, even in light of a report issued this month by Human
Rights Watch that enumerated 25 massacres it has perpetrated since
1992. This romanticism fits not only with Europe's image of the
Kurds as tragic heroes, but with its image of the Turks, who are
seen by some as brutes and whose less than sterling human rights
record tends to confirm the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema was probably sincere last
week when he urged Turkey to ``find a solution to this long and
bloody conflict by following the examples of Northern Ireland and
the Basque country.'' So, no doubt, was the chairman of the foreign
affairs committee in Germany's parliament, Hans-Ulrich Klose, who
called Ocalan's capture ``a good opportunity for solving the
country's problems with the PKK and making the necessary reforms in
Turkey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Turkish government's reaction is overblown and takes
Turkey very far from its target, Europe,'' Klose asserted.
</P>
<P>
   But for an array of historical and psychological reasons, Turks
abhor any suggestion that they should begin a dialogue with Kurdish
nationalists. Anyone who makes such a suggestion is considered
abysmally ignorant or worse. Many Turks now see Europe in that
category.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost exactly a year since the European Union
slammed its door in Turkey's face by pointedly excluding Turkey
from a list of 11 possible candidates for membership. In the
interim, several European leaders have recognized that they may
have acted too harshly.
</P>
<P>
   In November the European Union issued a new report that took a
much more encouraging tone. ``Turkey is eligible to become a
candidate,'' Hans van den Broek, the Union's external affairs
commissioner, said as he issued the report. The Union's
representative in Ankara, Karen Fogg, called it ``a very positive
indication,'' and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem said, ``The
EU Commission's definition of Turkey as the 12th candidate for full
membership has opened the way for improvement in bilateral
relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The election of a left-leaning government in Germany last month
seemed to give another boost to Turkey's European ambitions.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder pledged after taking office that he
would support measures ``bringing Turkey still closer to the
European Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ocalan affair and Turkey's reaction to it, however, have
confirmed European stereotypes about Turkey as a country that has
not yet learned the rules of civilized discourse. Even some Turkish
leaders seemed to acknowledge that Turkey's language might have
become too strident. President Suleyman Demirel urged Turks to ``be
well contained and not undermine the country's case.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in the wake of the collapse of Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz's government Wednesday, politicians will probably crank up
their patriotic denunciations of Europe with an eye to the
forthcoming election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks, including the entire political elite, believe that
Ocalan is such a hideous war criminal that there can be no debate
over the justice of Turkey's demand for his extradition. But in
Europe, everything is supposed to be open to debate. The contrast
suggests to some European leaders that Turkey is still in the grip
of a distinctly un-European tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had just reached the point of telling Turkey that its
application to join the EU would be considered on the same basis as
every other application, and then this happens,'' a European
ambassador lamented. ``Now there will be a period of silence, at
best. Turkey is not making it easy for us. They're not helping
their own image.''

   TEENS-PLASTIC-SURGERY _ A tide of affluent baby boomers are
being tucked, peeled and augmented as never before. But it is the
teen-age girls now flocking to the suites of plastic surgeons from
Park Avenue to Beverly Hills who pose an ethical problem for
doctors who must decide whether to operate on patients who are too
young to vote, but old enough to feel social pressures to be
physically perfect. By Jane Gross.

SURVIVOR AID BY TWO GROUPS CALLED SLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (With JEWS-SETTLE-DISPUTE.) 
(lb) 
 By BARRY MEIER

<P>
   Two of the Jewish groups that may play a major role in
distributing money from the Swiss banks' settlement have had
problems in the past getting aid quickly to aging Holocaust
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997 one group, the World Jewish Restitution
Organization, the umbrella organization led by Edgar Bronfman Sr.,
agreed to help distribute a $200 million fund set up by Swiss banks
and companies. That fund is separate from the $1.25 billion
settlement reached in August and was intended to get money to needy
survivors quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But 18 months later, survivors in the United States are only now
about to see money. Those in Israel, the country with the largest
number of survivors, will wait many months more.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the organization and the Israeli government hold
each other responsible for the delay. Noah Flug, secretary general
of the group, which is based in Jerusalem, said the delay arose
over who should oversee the distribution. He blames the Israeli
government.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Brown, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's adviser for
Diaspora affairs, disputed that view, saying that the government
insisted on being involved because it could safeguard the money far
better than private groups.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, the two sides settled their differences, but
Flug estimated that it could still take up to 10 months for
qualified applicants in Israel to receive money.
</P>
<P>
   The second group, the Conference on Jewish Material Claims
Against Germany, part of the World Jewish Restitution Organization,
has also faced criticism from survivors and others. The group,
based in New York, was set up in 1952 to deal with postwar
reparations by the Germans and has also reclaimed Jewish-owned
property in the former East Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it sells property for which heirs cannot be
traced and uses the money to underwrite activities like home care
and food packages for aging survivors throughout the world. Saul
Kagan, its executive director, said he believed that the
organization could easily incorporate the Swiss funds in its
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claims conference has the most direct experience in the
allocation of funds,'' said Kagan, who has led the group since its
founding. ``That is our mandate. We have no other mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   But others have complained that the group is a slow-moving
bureaucracy that often treats survivors with cool disdain. David
Lash, executive director of Bet Tzedek Legal Services in Los
Angeles, which aids survivors, said applicants can wait three years
before the claims conference rules on whether they are eligible for
pensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that my clients are dying during that waiting
period,'' Lash said.
</P>
<P>
   Holocaust survivors or their heirs have also asserted that the
claims organization, rather than helping them reclaim family-owned
property in the former East Germany, has tied them up in costly
court challenges. And over the last year, the group has also been
the subject of critical articles in The Washington Post and The
Jerusalem Report, an Israeli magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Kagan said he believed that such criticisms were vastly
overstated, adding that the typical pension request takes 12 to 18
months to review. And he said that, whether he likes it or not, his
group must follow eligibility guidelines that it negotiates with
the German government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said he had worked hard to liberalize those restrictions so
that more survivors can collect. ``A bed of roses was not built
into this job from day one,'' Kagan said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kagan, who plans to retire next month, said a few changes
had been made recently at the group's New York headquarters, where
workers, rather than using computers, sort through files in boxes
and battered green cabinets. Employees have also begun taking part
in sensitivity training sessions so they can deal more responsively
with the survivors they were hired to serve.

   Kervokian Makes a Legal Point of Assisted Suicide  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man known as Dr. Death got what he wanted: a murder charge,
a legal showdown and perhaps another national debate on assisted
suicide and euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Kevorkian was accused in Pontiac, Mich., of several
charges _ murder, criminal assistance to a suicide and delivery of
a controlled substance _ after he gave a lethal injection to Thomas
Youk, 52, who had a fatal neurological condition. The videotaped
death was broadcast last Sunday on CBS' ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Michigan juries have refused to convict Kevorkian. With no
state laws setting out the hows and whys of assisted suicide, a
fifth jury will decide if killing a person who wants to die is
murder.
</P>
<P>
   If he is convicted, Kevorkian says he will die a martyr's death
by going on a hunger strike.

<P>
   Side by side they seem to be the corporate odd couple of

Online purchased Netscape for roughly $4.2 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The worlds of media and technology, industry analysts say, will
meld together more and more in the future, so merging these two
companies may well make sense. In a side deal, America Online
announced a joint marketing and software development alliance with
Sun Microsystems to reassure Netscape's programmers.

   Managing Managed Care
</P>
<P>
   After failing to slow several years of rising medical costs,
health maintenance groups are pushing the costs on to the consumer.
Americans can expect to pay 8 percent to 20 percent more for
insurance premiums next year. The rise is the sharpest since the
early 1990s and reflects big increases in the prices of
prescription drugs, surgical devices and techniques and services to
patients outside hospitals.

   After an 11-week trial and voluminous testimony about lives of

Susan McDougal of all charges of embezzling $50,000 from the
conductor Zubin Mehta and his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors said prosecutors failed to make a credible case against
Ms. McDougal, the Mehtas' former bookkeeper and President Clinton's
onetime partner in the Whitewater deal. She still faces federal
criminal contempt of court charges in Arkansas for her refusal to
answer questions from the independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr.

   Many Lords A-Weeping
</P>
<P>
   The hereditary peers of the House of Lords got their eviction
notice from the queen herself while seated in their ermine-trimmed
scarlet robes.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was the pageant-filled State Opening of Parliament
in the ornate upper body during which the monarch reads a state of
the union speech written by the government outlining its
legislative program for the year. The most noted proposal this year
fulfills the pledge by Prime Minister Tony Blair to remove the
hereditary peers' right to sit and vote in the Lords.
</P>
<P>
   They are the dukes, earls, marquesses, viscounts and barons
whose titles, some dating from the Norman Conquest, are passed down
from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   Once they are gone, the House will be made up of 512 life peers
and 26 Lords Spiritual from the church, also unelected but named to
the body by prime ministers for accomplishments seen as more
meritorious than just being born.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony itself, the grandest occasion in the British
ceremonial calendar short of a coronation or royal funeral, was
slimmed down this year by Buckingham Palace in the name of
modernizing the monarchy. The number of attendants to the queen was
reduced from 51 to 37, eliminating some of the most gorgeously
preposterous names in the realm. Gone were people like Portcullis
Pursuivant, Maltravers Herald Extraordinary and Silver Stick in
Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   For onlookers in the hall and on television, the reduction in
panoply was barely noticeable as gilded carriages rattled up to the
front gates of Parliament, and lavishly dressed courtiers carried
golden maces, silk purses and miniver-trimmed ceremonial caps in
the procession behind the queen and her 18-foot train.

Stick in Waiting still was.

   The French, Now Sniffing At Themselves
</P>
<P>
   This is a delicate topic. It should probably not even be
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, if the French want to talk about it, why not?
</P>
<P>
   The daily Le Figaro, you see, just published a survey about
French sanitary habits _ what amounts, basically, to an entire
nation counting its dirty linen in public.
</P>
<P>
   Not washing, mind you _ counting. The French have the
unfortunate reputation of not being the cleanest people in the
world. And now, for some reason that would no doubt be clear only
if explained in French, they have given chapter and verse for what,
in fact, seem to be less than meticulous habits.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling (if you really want to know): Only 47 percent bathe
daily, just 60 percent of Frenchmen change their underwear daily
(women, no doubt, indignantly refused to answer), and just 60
percent wash their hands after using the bathroom (Germans, by the
way, buy more than twice as much hand soap as the French).
</P>
<P>
   That last point prompted one television personality to suggest
that if you run into the boss outside the office restroom, it would
be best to head off any chance of a handshake by grabbing a sizable
file folder.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one more thing: only half the French say they use deodorant.
But after all, France is the center of the perfume universe. Has
been for centuries. In the Middle Ages, crusaders returned bearing
the secrets of perfume, and France soon dominated the industry.
Shalimar, anyone?

the Boston newspapers, Kraft offered a 1,400-word apology. ``Make

   Many Lords A-Weeping
</P>
<P>
   The hereditary peers of the House of Lords got their eviction
notice from the queen herself while seated in their ermine-trimmed
scarlet robes.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was the pageant-filled State Opening of Parliament
in the ornate upper body during which the monarch reads a state of
the union speech written by the government outlining its
legislative program for the year. The most noted proposal this year
fulfills the pledge by Prime Minister Tony Blair to remove the
hereditary peers' right to sit and vote in the Lords.
</P>
<P>
   They are the dukes, earls, marquesses, viscounts and barons
whose titles, some dating from the Norman Conquest, are passed down
from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   Once they are gone, the House will be made up of 512 life peers
and 26 Lords Spiritual from the church, also unelected but named to
the body by prime ministers for accomplishments seen as more
meritorious than just being born.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony itself, the grandest occasion in the British
ceremonial calendar short of a coronation or royal funeral, was
slimmed down this year by Buckingham Palace in the name of
modernizing the monarchy. The number of attendants to the queen was
reduced from 51 to 37, eliminating some of the most gorgeously
preposterous names in the realm. Gone were people like Portcullis
Pursuivant, Maltravers Herald Extraordinary and Silver Stick in
Waiting.
</P>
<P>
   For onlookers in the hall and on television, the reduction in
panoply was barely noticeable as gilded carriages rattled up to the
front gates of Parliament, and lavishly dressed courtiers carried
golden maces, silk purses and miniver-trimmed ceremonial caps in
the procession behind the queen and her 18-foot train.
</P>
<P>
   True, Silver Stick in Waiting was no longer there. But Gold
Stick in Waiting still was.

<P>
   The French, Now Sniffing At Themselves
</P>
<P>
   This is a delicate topic. It should probably not even be
mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, if the French want to talk about it, why not?
</P>
<P>
   The daily Le Figaro, you see, just published a survey about
French sanitary habits _ what amounts, basically, to an entire
nation counting its dirty linen in public.
</P>
<P>
   Not washing, mind you _ counting. The French have the
unfortunate reputation of not being the cleanest people in the
world. And now, for some reason that would no doubt be clear only
if explained in French, they have given chapter and verse for what,
in fact, seem to be less than meticulous habits.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling (if you really want to know): Only 47 percent bathe
daily, just 60 percent of Frenchmen change their underwear daily
(women, no doubt, indignantly refused to answer), and just 60
percent wash their hands after using the bathroom (Germans, by the
way, buy more than twice as much hand soap as the French).
</P>
<P>
   That last point prompted one television personality to suggest
that if you run into the boss outside the office restroom, it would
be best to head off any chance of a handshake by grabbing a sizable
file folder.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one more thing: only half the French say they use deodorant.
But after all, France is the center of the perfume universe. Has
been for centuries. In the Middle Ages, crusaders returned bearing
the secrets of perfume, and France soon dominated the industry.
Shalimar, anyone?

SOFT MONEY BECOMES A HARD FACT OF PRESIDENTIAL POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Md., NH, Calif., NY, Maine, Va., Ind., Tenn., Texas,
Mass., Mo.) (mk) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., is engaged in the first
test of the 2000 presidential campaign: proving his ability to
raise money. Like other Democratic and Republican hopefuls, he will
have to raise more money than ever, at least $22 million, and
earlier than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for creative ways to get donations much larger than
those allowed by the strict limits of federal election laws, Kerrey
and six other presidential aspirants have turned to so-called soft
money. To raise these large unrestricted contributions from wealthy
individuals, corporations and labor unions, they are exploiting the
less-restrictive political donation regulations at the state level,
establishing nonprofit organizations and setting up political
action committees.
</P>
<P>
   Soft money is bleeding into the presidential campaign earlier
than ever before and spreading among more potential candidates. And
these controversial big donations are being solicited directly by
the potential candidates for their own political committees, while
in the past soft money was funneled through the national political
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974, passed after
Watergate to prohibit large, special-interest contributions, limits
donations to presidential primary candidates to $1,000. But there
are many legal ways for aspiring candidates to skirt that limit.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey's fund-raising device, for example, is a political action
committee that is allowed to raise larger soft money contributions.
Next month, many of Kerrey's most generous financial backers plan
to gather in Omaha, Neb., at Boys Town, where his political action
committee, Building America's Conscience and Kids PAC, is
sponsoring an international economic conference. Most of them have
already given to this committee, which has raised $1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Among those expected to attend are Kerrey supporters like the
Baltimore Orioles owner, Peter Angelos, and the Wall Street
investor Barry Wigmore, who have each already donated $25,000 to
the political action committee, established in June. They can give
these larger sums because Kerrey's committee is set up with both
federal and non-federal accounts as allowed by law. The non-federal
account can accept unlimited contributions. In fact, the committee
has raised almost $800,000 through its non-federal account.
</P>
<P>
   Without this soft money, it is unlikely that Kerrey or other
presidential hopefuls considering the race could raise $50,000 a
day between now and the selection of the first delegates in early
2000. This amount is necessary to reach the minimum of $22 million
that several campaign experts estimate candidates would need to be
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a staggering sum,'' said Steve Jarding, the senator's
national political director. ``But Bob believes he could raise the
money if he ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the political parties have been the main fund-raising
vehicles for these large donations. In 1996, soft money
contributions to the Democratic National Committee became a source
of controversy when millions of dollars from the party were used to
pay for early advertising that benefited the Clinton-Gore ticket.
Attorney General Janet Reno must soon decide whether to ask for an
independent counsel to investigate the soft money ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kerrey, at least five Republican presidential hopefuls have
established state-level political committees. Ostensibly, these
committees are meant to support local candidates. Kerrey, for
example, has used his to make campaign donations to local
Democratic candidates, including $85,000 sent to New Hampshire, the
site of the first presidential primary. But the state committees
are also being used by the aspirants to pay for big-ticket items,
like travel, staff and even more fund raising for their incipient
national campaigns. And these committees are not the only devices
the candidates are using to raise unlimited contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The wealthy publisher Steve Forbes has also established a
nonprofit organization, Americans for Hope Growth and Opportunity,
that is raising unrestricted contributions. Forbes, who ran
unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential nomination in 1996, himself
gave $100,000, and the organization has raised more than $13
million from 140,000 donors, said Bill Dal Col, the group's
president.
</P>
<P>
   While Dal Col said the organization supported issues, not
candidates, the issues championed by Americans for Hope Growth and
Opportunity are the ones Forbes embraced in 1996, including tax
cuts and school choice.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts say the big presence of soft money so
early in the presidential election season is further evidence of
the erosion of the post-Watergate election law reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1988, the two political parties began gutting the
federal limits by soliciting soft money donations, which are
unlimited but are supposed to be used only for generic
party-building activities.
</P>
<P>
   This year, both parties used soft money to pay for issue
advertising in the congressional elections. According to
pre-election reports filed at the Federal Election Commission, soft
money contributions to Republican Party committees grew 144 percent
over the last midterm elections, while Democratic soft money totals
increased 84 percent. Together, the two parties raked in $173
million in soft money. The FEC is currently considering a proposal
to ban soft money.
</P>
<P>
   Today, soft money already is bleeding into the presidential
primary contests. Because the primaries are front-loaded in 2000,
with many big states, including California and New York, expected
to choose delegates before early March, and because the amount of
money needed to run is larger than ever, ``the pressure will be the
most intense to raise money before the primary season even
begins,'' said Anthony Corrado, a government professor at Colby
College in Waterville, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   That means presidential hopefuls are ``raising more money than
at a similar point than in the 1996 cycle and they are raising much
more money that isn't subject to federal regulation,'' he added.
And funds raised for state political action committees or nonprofit
organizations are not disclosed to the FEC.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Terry McAuliffe, a leading Democratic fund-raiser, said the
schedule of early primaries, including regional contests in the
South, New England and the Rocky Mountain states, would have a
profound effect on fund raising in 2000. ``The way this primary
schedule has been designed there is no presidential fund-raising
strategy that allows you to raise money in 2000,'' he said in an
interview. ``It must all be raised in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe said this would create a more closed contest because
an outsider candidate would not have time to exploit a surprise win
to raise money, as George Bush did in 1980 after winning the Iowa
caucuses. ``I think it's horrible,'' he said. ``Only a few people
can play this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Money spent during this early stage by presidential aspirants
does not count against the spending limit set for presidential
primary candidates who accept federal matching funds. In 1996, the
amount was $37 million and is expected to be about $45 million in
2000. Once their candidacy is declared, presidential contenders can
no longer be affiliated with political action committees and must
limit their contributions from individuals to $1,000. (Forbes did
not accept matching funds in 1996 and spent more than $30 million
of his own money. In 2000, if he runs, Dal Col said Forbes would
not spend as much of his own money, but would not accept matching
funds.)
</P>
<P>
   Until they become declared candidates, presidential aspirants
can continue to solicit soft money for their state-level political
action committees without worrying about complying with more rigid
federal rules. Most of these committees have been set up in states
with the least restrictive election laws. Virginia, which permits
unlimited contributions from both individuals and corporations, has
been a popular site for political action committees connected to
the 2000 presidential aspirants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia has become the Cayman Islands of presidential
fund-raising,'' said Larry Makinson, executive director of the
Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington research group that
tracks contributions. Five Republicans, former Vice President Dan
Quayle, the conservative leader Gary Bauer, former Gov. Lamar
Alexander of Tennessee, the former vice presidential nominee Jack
Kemp and Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., have political action
committees in Virginia. Although the Republican leaders have used
some of their Virginia money to back local candidates, most of it
has not not been spent in the Old Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   Not all would-be 2000 candidates have state political action
committees. Vice President Al Gore and former Democratic Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey both have only federal PACs. Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas has yet to establish such a committee. Sen. John
Kerry, D-Mass., who has spurned political action committee money
for most of his career, is considering setting up such a committee
as he explores whether to run for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The early front-runners, like the vice president and the Texas
governor, may not need to use state committees. Both have national
fund-raising networks and can raise money quickly. Gore has been a
fund-raising star for the Democratic National Committee. Bush will
have easy access to wealthy Texas donors and his father's old money
machine. Last summer, Bush raised more than $1 million in
Washington for his re-election campaign at a fund-raising dinner
organized by some of former President Bush's long-time financial
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, who has headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee, and the House minority leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., also have national fund-raising networks, though theirs are
not as formidable as Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, Alexander, who pioneered the use of
state political action committees and soft money and made an
unsuccessful bid for the GOP nomination in 1996, has proved to be a
prodigious early fund-raiser. Bauer has raised millions nationally
through the mail. And Forbes is in a class of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Both Alexander and Forbes have already spent large sums on issue
ads in early primary states like New Hampshire.

GIFTED COLLEGE QUARTERBACKS READY TO GRADUATE TO NFL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOE DRAPE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One is famous for not being famous _ except among scouts who
haunt Central Florida and project him as the quarterback for a new
millennium. Another is a volatile and obsessive winner who has
thrown passes 90 yards in practice with the help of Kansas' prairie
winds.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hard-nosed left-hander who got sick at midfield but
made opponents feel worse with one comeback victory after another.
There is a perennial Heisman Trophy hopeful whose candidacy has
never quite caught on outside central New York.
</P>
<P>
   Add a former minor-league baseball player who has put the quack
back in the Oregon Ducks' attack, and a determined Ohio State
marksman who has evolved from junior college star to part-timer to
bona fide pro prospect. And the two juniors: the latest model from
Washington's quarterback factory, who has already said he will
enter the National Football League draft, and the legend from the
mountains of eastern Kentucky who leads a sophisticated,
record-setting air attack.
</P>
<P>
   In total, they are college football's quarterback class of 1999:
Daunte Culpepper of Central Florida, Michael Bishop of Kansas
State, Cade McNown of UCLA, Donovan McNabb of Syracuse, Akili Smith
of Oregon, Joe Germaine of Ohio State, Brock Huard of Washington
and _ if he decides to go pro _ Tim Couch of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   They are responsible for looks of ecstasy on the faces of scouts
in film rooms across the NFL. They are solace for the
quarterback-hungry teams that watched helplessly as Peyton Manning
and Ryan Leaf went first and second in the last draft.
</P>
<P>
   They invite comparison to the Class of 1983, when six
quarterbacks were first-round picks, including two certain Hall of
Famers in John Elway and Dan Marino and perhaps a third in Jim
Kelly. And they have inspired more than the usual paranoia among
NFL scouts and general managers, afraid of tipping their hand about
their draft plans.
</P>
<P>
   Of five scouts and executives interviewed for this article, none
wanted to be identified and only a few agreed to be quoted. All
said it was too early to assess the quarterbacks' performances and
slot them in the draft. They insisted that they needed to see the
prospects first-hand at all-star games or the NFL combines or
private workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, you know this is a very talented and very deep
group of quarterbacks,'' said one scout for a National Football
Conference team. ``The potential for a great class is there. But
the class of 1983 only happened once, and it's unfair to measure
these guys by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those interviewed projected that two quarterbacks,
possibly three, would be selected in the first round. They all
agreed that Culpepper held an edge over the rest. Surprisingly,
perhaps, most agreed that Couch and Huard should remain in school.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper's numbers are what have brought the scouts to Orlando
and upstart Central Florida, which is in only its third season in
Division I-A. Culpepper led the Golden Knights to a 9-2 record by
passing for 3,690 yards and 28 touchdowns and, over four years, a
25-19 record against a schedule heavy on strong Southeastern
Conference teams. His 73.6 completion percentage this season broke
Steve Young's 1983 National Collegiate Athletic Association record.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the numbers that are eye-catching: Culpepper is 6
feet 4 inches and 240 pounds, runs the 40-yard dash in 4.6 seconds
and handles 455 pounds in the squat _ a stellar athlete by any
measure. The professional talent judges like his mobility _ he is
only the third college player to throw for 10,000 yards and rush
for 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they say he does not look to run first. Instead, he reads
coverages expertly, rarely makes a mistake when changing plays at
the line of scrimmage and instinctively takes what is given to him.
The reason he is considered an immediate impact player is coaching.
</P>
<P>
   First as offensive coordinator, and this year as Central
Florida's head coach, the former Pittsburgh Steeler backup
quarterback Mike Kruczek has treated Culpepper to the most advanced
tutoring of any of the quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kruczek has played in our league and is a great offensive mind
and teacher,'' an NFC general manager said. ``He has brought
Culpepper along further than any of the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the rest of the senior quarterbacks, Kansas State's Bishop
has separated himself slightly from the pack. Like Culpepper, he is
physically blessed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At 6-1 and 210 pounds, he is an electrifying and sturdy
open-field runner who is equally adept with his cannon of an arm.
Within minutes against Nebraska, he jetted down the middle for 51
yards on a draw play and rocketed a 61-yard pass on a precise
timing route. He has run for 13 touchdowns and passed for 21 more,
and 2,503 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Like UCLA's McNown, Bishop has a fierce will to win. He is 46-1
as a collegiate starter, including two perfect seasons capped by
national championships at Blinn Junior College to go with this
season's 11-0 record heading into next Saturday's Big 12
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts admire Bishop for carrying a team with little football
tradition, but they also wonder if his raw competitiveness will
slow his development. He initiates unnecessary hits at the ends of
runs. He berates himself and his teammates. Twice in the last two
years, Bishop has been told not to talk to reporters by his coach,
Bill Snyder, who acknowledges frequent conversations with his
quarterback about keeping his emotion to a controlled rage.
</P>
<P>
   But Snyder also argues that Bishop is a quick study, that when
Snyder decided not to redshirt him after he arrived from Blinn,
Bishop responded by devouring the intricacies of a complicated
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``His competitiveness makes him the player he is,'' Snyder said.
``But really he's had a little more than a year within our system
and he's learned so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' McNown is likely to be the most debated of the
quarterbacks. He has led UCLA to 20 consecutive victories _ the
nation's longest current streak _ and recently won the Johnny
Unitas Golden Arm Award. He also leads this crop in heroics, the
most memorable moments coming during a 41-38 overtime victory
against Oregon that included his midfield illness and two
50-plus-yard bombs to end regulation and force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's magic, a one-man band; he's got the intangibles,'' the
NFC executive said. ``This year has helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are questions about McNown's size and athletic talent.
He does not look as big as his listed 6-1 and 214 pounds or as
strong-armed as the others, even though he has thrown for 2,617
yards and 18 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He is agile, but not a speedster. The same questions were raised
about two current NFL quarterbacks: Doug Flutie, who practiced his
magic in Canada before his unlikely comeback this year with the
Buffalo Bills, and Jake Plummer, who was drafted in the second
round and now leads the Arizona Cardinals. ``He's maybe a third- or
little later rounder,'' another NFC general manager, whose team is
not looking for a quarterback, said of McNown.
</P>
<P>
   There are also widely varying opinions about Syracuse's McNabb,
Oregon's Smith and Ohio State's Germaine. Their talents are not as
obvious as those of the top three quarterbacks; each could become a
steal in the lower rounds.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb and Smith, each 6-3 and 220 pounds, mirror each other in
athletic ability. McNabb, the Syracuse senior, is more experienced
and a better runner. This season he has run for 5 touchdowns,
thrown for 20 against just 4 interceptions and repeatedly shown a
flair for play-making. Most recently he beat Virginia Tech by
rolling one way and passing to the opposite corner of the end zone
for a touchdown on the final play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an incredible talent with first-round ability,'' the
general manager said, though he projects McNown two rounds lower.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Smith, a refugee from the Pittsburgh Pirates
organization, is also developing an NFL following. Some see a
maturity and level of professional experience in the nation's
second most effective passer that were not easily apparent when he
was a part-time starter for Oregon last year as a junior. Smith has
thrown 30 touchdowns and is rated higher than McNown in the
Pacific-10 Conference in every passing category.
</P>
<P>
   Like Smith, Ohio State's Germaine came from a junior college,
shared time as a junior and only this year has asserted himself as
a top quarterback. At a slight 6 feet 2 inches and 205 pounds, he
is by far the least imposing of the group, but may be among the
most accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have the others' tools, but he can pass and he's
smart,'' the first NFC general manager said. ``He has been thought
to be a step down from the others, but I'm not so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the juniors, Huard and Couch. Huard figures
he is ready to follow such Huskie quarterbacks as Mark Brunell and
Chris Chandler into the NFL and has declared for the draft. He
threw for 1,840 yards and 15 touchdowns despite missing two games
with a separated shoulder as his young team struggled to a 6-5
record.
</P>
<P>
   It is a risky decision, according to scouts, especially for a
player who is coming off a disappointing year. No scouts endorsed
an early entry for Couch, either, though they recognized his talent
and were impressed by his gaudy numbers in Kentucky's pass-happy
attack: 4,275 yards and 36 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   One NFL executive cited the troubled transitions of Dave Brown,
who left Duke with a year of eligibility remaining, and Tommy
Maddox, who left UCLA after his sophomore season. The executive
said that only Bernie Kosar had made the leap successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``History says it sets you back,'' he said. ``There's too much
to learn. There's too many things you need that come only with
time.''

SAINTS HOPE KERRY COLLINS IS TURNING HIS LIFE AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A crucial step in the evolution of quarterback Kerry Collins
came when he recently began counseling for alcohol abuse, according
to several National Football League executives and people close to
Collins. The quarterback, those people said, is taking drastic
steps to change his life.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Collins, just weeks ago the poster boy for
quitters, is successfully transforming himself and his image from
immature player to franchise quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   Collins declined to be interviewed. Leigh Steinberg, his agent,
would not discuss specifics of the quarterback's private life, but
said: ``I will tell you he is addressing any problems that he had.
He is taking an honest look at his behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins has had a rocky professional career. It started with
highs like taking the Carolina Panthers to the National Football
Conference title game in only his second season. Then came the
lows, such as his use of a racial epithet in reference to a black
teammate last summer, and his quitting on the Panthers last month.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Collins was portrayed as someone no team could ever
rely on. The Panthers cut him, and the only team to show serious
interest was the New Orleans Saints, who signed Collins to a
one-year deal. Most teams thought Collins' career was basically
over.
</P>
<P>
   But guess what? He is making a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize it is very early,'' said Saints general manager
Bill Kuharich, ``but Kerry is doing well. We just want him to
develop as a person and a football player.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be happening. Even though the Saints were
disappointed this month when Collins was arrested on charges of
driving while intoxicated in North Carolina _ the embarrassing
arrest led to his decision to get counseling _ he has impressed
Saints officials and teammates with his professionalism and
toughness. Don't be surprised if the organization offers Collins a
long-term deal before he becomes a free agent in February.
</P>
<P>
   Saints coaches knew Collins had a strong arm, and in two starts
since joining the team, he displayed that power several times by
squeezing passes between two and three defenders. But what seemed
to surprise some members of the coaching staff was his poise under
pressure in the pocket.
</P>
<P>
   In his first start against St. Louis on Nov. 15, Collins
completed 13 of 26 passes for 150 yards. ``I thought it was
important to come out and show my heart was in it,'' Collins said
after that game. ``I wanted to show my teammates that they could
depend on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Against San Francisco, he completed 22 of 44 passes for 328
yards. He also ran for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with how Kerry is progressing,'' coach Mike Ditka
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints believe that after going through players like Billy
Joe Hobert, Heath Shuler and Danny Wuerffel, Collins could be their
franchise quarterback. But the question remains: what happened with
Collins and the Panthers?
</P>
<P>
   Some NFL scouts believe Collins never adapted to his role as the
franchise savior because he hated being in the spotlight. With the
Saints, he is not asked to win games by himself, and Ditka attracts
all the cameras and microphones that Collins hates.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is not the only first-round quarterback in the 1990s to
struggle early in his career. More and more players are having a
difficult time making either the physical or mental adjustment to
professional football. ``This is one of the toughest times for a
young, top quarterback to enter the league,'' said Green Bay
general manager Ron Wolf. ``So much is asked of him.''
</P>
<P>
   A quarterback drafted to lead a team as a rookie 20 years ago,
or even 10, did not have to deal with complicated zone blitz
defenses or the proliferation of news media watching every move.
Some men crumble under the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The number of blown top picks on quarterbacks in the 1990's has
been staggering. For every good pick like Drew Bledsoe, there are
two wasted picks like David Klingler. Tommy Maddox, Andre Ware,
Todd Marinovich, Rick Mirer, Dan McGuire and Shuler were No. 1
picks who failed miserably.
</P>
<P>
   To find a good example of just how delicate the business of
finding a franchise quarterback is, one only needs to go back to
last year's draft. Indianapolis chose Peyton Manning with the first
pick, and San Diego selected Ryan Leaf with the second. Though
Manning has thrown 22 interceptions, he has made tremendous
progress on the field and apparently has been a model citizen off
the field as well.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Leaf. He has been a disaster. Leaf was benched
this month for the career backup Craig Whelihan after completing
just 4 of 15 pass attempts against Denver on Nov. 8. Leaf has a
39.9 quarterback rating, the worst in football.
</P>
<P>
   He has acted so immaturely off the field _ he threw beer on
students at a bar during a recent return to the Washington State
campus and cursed out a reporter last summer _ that Chargers Coach
June Jones said he has to constantly work with Leaf on his
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high picks are still young men who get fame and wealth,''
Kuharich said. ``Some can handle it, some can't. Peyton Manning
can, Ryan Leaf can't. Kerry could early on, then he couldn't, and
now we think he can.''  &QL;

DIFFERENT PATHS FOR BRONCOS AND VIKINGS  
 DEAL REACHED OVER WOODSON'S REFUSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Different Paths for Broncos and Vikings
</P>
<P>
   The Denver Broncos and Minnesota Vikings are dominating their
respective conferences to the point that few think they will not
play each other in the Super Bowl. If they do meet, the teams will
have taken drastically different mental approaches to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan does not shy from talk of an
undefeated season or winning another championship. In fact, he
embraces both.
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings are taking the opposite approach. ``We can't think
like the Broncos,'' said the Minnesota fullback Leroy Hoard,
``because they've been there. We haven't. They can take that
approach if they want, but we want to take it one team at a time.
That's not a sexy approach like the Broncos, but it has worked for
us so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal Reached Over Woodson's Refusal
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, Baltimore Ravens defensive back Rod
Woodson, a future Hall of Famer, refused to take a random drug test
because he had been tested several days earlier and felt he was
being unfairly targeted. Under the league's policy, a refusal
counts as a positive test, and Woodson was placed in Stage 1 of the
league's program, which calls for evaluation, counseling and
increased testing.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson had planned to appeal that decision to commissioner Paul
Tagliabue, but one team executive said a compromise was reached by
Woodson, the league and the players association late this month.
Woodson would remain in Stage 1 for an unknown period, and since no
one believes Woodson has ever used drugs, the league assumes
Woodson would pass the assessment period and then be released from
the program.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson, in his 12th season and a member of the 75th anniversary
team, has never failed a drug test, team executives said.

SPORTS COLUMN: IS JETS' TIME BOMB TICKING ONCE AGAIN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Throughout his tempestuous career, Bryan Cox has often talked
about how he has to play football on the ``edge,'' about how he
``can't lose that edge.'' But now he has toppled over that edge,
again.
</P>
<P>
   When the New York Jets, after losing the injured linebacker
Marvin Jones last summer, suddenly signed Cox, coach Bill Parcells
did not try to put him on trial or on probation for having
sometimes created chaos with the Miami Dolphins and the Chicago
Bears in other years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just be Bryan Cox,'' Parcells told him.
</P>
<P>
   But just being Bryan Cox is like being a time bomb, a danger to
others and to himself. Although he had been on his best behavior
since joining the Jets, anyone familiar with his past could hear
this 6-foot-4-inch, 250-pound time bomb ticking. And the bomb
finally exploded, in a relatively quiet locker room eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Upon learning of his $10,000 fine for unnecessary roughness in
clubbing (without a penalty) both quarterback Steve McNair and
running back Eddie George last Sunday in Tennessee, the 30-year-old
Cox, who is black, calmly accused the National Football League of
racism in its hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I'm unhappy about the fine, I will take the fine,''
he said. ``I don't want to be a person that's going to cause some
conflict in this locker room. I'm trying to do the best that I can.
We're in the middle of trying to make the best playoff run we can
make.''
</P>
<P>
   For six consecutive seasons, Cox has had at least one incendiary
incident and nine over all at a total cost of $146,000 in fines,
believed to be an NFL career record.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the time bomb has exploded again, even calmly, is that
all there is? Will he revert just to being a solid linebacker
helping in the Jets' quest for the Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Or will Cox resume going tick, tick, tick, especially on Dec.
13, when the Jets are in Miami, where his split personality wore
out his welcome, and again on Dec. 19 when the Jets are in Buffalo,
where he feuded with and spit at Bills rooters while with the
Dolphins?
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been in Buffalo since a 1995 playoff game (which the
Dolphins lost), when his running feud with the Bills' fans prompted
the presence of more than two dozen county police in riot helmets
behind the Dolphins' bench and both end zones in Rich Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent is not to injure anybody,'' Cox said on Wednesday,
``just to cause as much pain and hurt as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Causing pain and hurt is the mantra of every linebacker, but few
acknowledge it as bluntly as Cox does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a three-piece suit and tie, and I'm not going to
the stock market exchange,'' he has said. ``I hit people and hurt
people for a living. I try to cause as much pain to somebody as I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledges his split personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like I'm a schizophrenic,'' he has said. ``Some days I
could have a chip on my shoulder for no reason and it doesn't take
a lot to set me off. Other days I'm happy and excited and eager
about life.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox has a long NFL rap sheet of fines:
</P>
<P>
   One game's pay ($87,500 at the time) for an obscene gesture at a
game official while with the Bears in 1996; $5,000, $10,000 and
$15,000 for fighting; $5,000 for spitting at fans; $3,000 for an
obscene gesture at fans (reduced from $10,000 after the NFL agreed
to ``maintain a work environment free from racial harassment'' in
Buffalo); $5,000 for public criticism of game officials; $3,000 and
now $10,000 for unnecessary roughness.
</P>
<P>
   When not wearing his football helmet, Cox, who has a wife and
three children, has a reputation as a teddy-bear family man who has
contributed his time and money to rebuilding a church in his East
St. Louis, Ill., hometown, to his high school there and to a
fitness center at his college, Western Illinois. In repose, he is
considered a good guy, bright and articulate. But he is a good guy
who has bad moments, all of them as an almost lethal linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what people think,'' he has said. ``I do my job
the best I can, and I do what I think is right.''
</P>
<P>
   In accusing the NFL of racism, Cox cited the absence of any
African-American club owners, the presence of only three black head
coaches, and the difficulty that black assistant coaches have in
attaining head coaching status or even being interviewed to fill a
head coaching vacancy _ each a valid argument.
</P>
<P>
   But in branding Gene Washington, the NFL dean of discipline who
was once a star 49ers wide receiver, and Harold Henderson, its
labor relations director, as token black executives pitted against
the players, 70 percent of whom are black, Cox missed the tackle.
</P>
<P>
   If those jobs in the league office were being done by white
executives, Cox would have a much better case. Instead, he is
arguing racism both ways _ the absence of any black NFL club owners
as well as the presence of two black league executives in important
decision-making positions.
</P>
<P>
   As for his latest $10,000 fine, the Jets linebacker contended
that ``if it was another player, I don't think that person would've
been fined.'' But with his rap sheet, Bryan Cox is not about to get
the benefit of the doubt. Time bombs never do. &QL;

HOW WEATHER-PROOF IS TESTAVERDE? DECEMBER GAMES WILL TELL. 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sunday may be the last time this season Vinny Testaverde and the
New York Jets enjoy a 50-degree game day. But even the onset of
December may not hurt the Jets who, increasingly, are giving
evidence that neither bad weather nor a month that has doomed them
in the past will halt them this season.
</P>
<P>
   So the question that coach Bill Parcells wants Testaverde to
answer is: Are you a weatherproof quarterback?
</P>
<P>
   That may not be a pressing concern when the Jets face the
Carolina Panthers at the New Jersey Meadowlands, where it is
expected to be sunny. But by day's end, the west wind could sweep
in, disrupting kickers and passers.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Jets go into December, with two more games at the
Meadowlands, another in Buffalo and one in Miami. In at least three
of those final games, there could be snow. And each should be
buffeted by wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some quarterbacks are weatherproof _ that means they can play
in bad weather,'' Parcells said. He cited Phil Simms from the
Giants years, as well as the Packers' Brett Favre, the Bills' Jim
Kelly, the Bears' Jim McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has never seen Testaverde perform in howling winds or
swirling snow. What evidence does he have that Testaverde won't go
cold in December? It has happened to Jets quarterbacks before.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, if the Jets win Sunday, they will be 8-4. That was
exactly the record they took into last December, but they went 1-3
and failed to make the playoffs. And from 1993 through 1996, the
Jets lost 15 straight games in December. Parcells was not able to
break this cycle of December losses last year. What makes him think
this year, this quarterback is different?
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just tell he is,'' Parcells said. ``Vinny throws a tight
spiral. I saw him in Kansas City,'' he said, referring to a victory
four weeks ago on a windy, rainy, and overall miserable day.
``Nothing seems to be bothering him. He doesn't get up in the
morning and say, `Oh, my god.'''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Testaverde hit on 20 of 34 passes for 260 yards,
connected for a game-tying touchdown in the final period. He was
intercepted once on what Parcells claimed was a faulty route by
Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The overall record indicates that the 6-foot 5-inch, 235-pound
Testaverde is, indeed, a good cold-weather quarterback. Since
Testaverde escaped in 1993 from Tampa Bay, where his statistics are
skewed by years of playing for a lowly franchise, Testaverde has
proven to be an outstanding passer in December in cold-weather
cities.
</P>
<P>
   In his previous five seasons with Cleveland/Baltimore, counting
only games in December and January that were outdoors, he played
six times in bad-weather cities. Over that span, he completed 63
percent of his passes and tossed 12 touchdowns to only 8
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   If Testaverde can approach these figures in the coming weeks,
then perhaps the last vestige of the problems Parcells inherited
can be obliterated. When Parcells took over he addressed the team's
failure to win in the second half, its inability to win on the road
(or even at home), its penchant for giving up big plays and,
simply, giving up.
</P>
<P>
   That the Jets stumbled last December flies in the face of
Parcells' coaching record which is remarkable in cold-weather. His
December (and January) teams have posted a combined record of
41-24.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells also expects his special teams, which are among the
best in the league right now, to be even better when the weather
turns nasty. His only complaint has been with the punt-return unit,
led by Leon Johnson, which has not broken a big play. It did last
year. This year Johnson has been sidelined by injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the weather gets cold,'' Parcells said, ``some players
don't like to tackle. That plays a part on special teams.'' But he
is talking about opponents that don't enjoy tackling. He believes
his players do, and he believes they will be even more effective in
coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Even the coach's concerns about John Hall and his 68 percent
field-goal percentage (Parcells wants 75 percent) is tempered by
Hall's consistent kickoffs into the end zone. And Hall does have an
extremely strong leg that can neutralize winds. As a result, the
Jets' field position after kicking off is the best in the American
Conference-opponents begin their drives backed inside their own 24.
</P>
<P>
   For his special teams to remain as good as they are, though,
Parcells contends the players must remain healthy. If they do not,
he will be forced to take regulars off their starting jobs and put
them on the kicking game, or force them to split time between the
two. That would hurt their effectiveness. For now, though, the Jets
are remarkably healthy. No one is even on the injury last for this
game. Last Sunday, only one player was.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, meanwhile, reported 10 players with various
problems coming into Sunday's game. ``I'd like to know what the
Jets' secret is,'' said Carolina coach Dom Capers. ``I'm going to
look at it in the off season.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ VINNY TESTAVERDE has successfully converted third-down passes
46.9 percent of the time. That is the fourth-best record in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   _ If the Jets make the playoffs, BILL PARCELLS will become only
the second coach to produce the feat with three different clubs. He
previously made it with the Giants and Patriots. CHUCK KNOX got
into the post-season with the Rams, Bills and Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   _ With 71 yards rushing, CURTIS MARTIN will become the sixth
running back in history to gain 1,000 yards in his first four
seasons. The Lions' BARRY SANDERS has done it his first 10 years in
the league.

MILOSEVIC'S PURGES HINT AT VIOLENT END FOR REGIME
</HEADLINE>
   (jw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ In moves viewed here and by some in
Washington as signs of weakness rather than strength, President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia has conducted an extraordinary
purge of his innermost circle, dismissing the leaders of the army,
the air force and the intelligence service, as well as one of his
most trusted political commissars.
</P>
<P>
   Few are brave enough to say how or when Milosevic, the strongman
of Yugoslavia, will go. But many officials here and in Washington
agree that the dismissals represent the beginning of the end.
</P>
<P>
   The purge, conducted in the wake of Milosevic's agreement on
Oct. 13 to pull troops out of Kosovo, culminated last week with the
dismissal of Gen. Momcilo Perisic, the long-serving army chief of
staff and an architect of the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month Milosevic has been seen by former associates
as increasingly insecure, even paranoid, as Kosovo drifts from his
control, the enfeebled economy gets weaker and he bows to the
demands of his politically powerful wife, replacing his
apparatchiks with hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in their minds they know that there will be social unrest
and they want totally loyal people around them when it happens,''
Bratislav Grubacic, the editor of an English-language newsletter
for diplomats and others in Belgrade, said of Milosevic and his
wife, Mirjana Markovic. ``He is closing the areas where he doesn't
feel comfortable _ people in the state apparatus who might
eventually become disloyal.''
</P>
<P>
   A Washington official who has followed Yugoslavia for more than
a decade said: ``The regime is brittle. It will crack. It will
break.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals have inspired open talk here of the resemblance
between the ruling court of Milosevic, his wife and their two
wealthy children, Marko and Marija, and that of the Ceaucescu
family in Romania, which was dominated by a husband-and-wife team
and collapsed in a bloody downfall in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Milosevic would have important consequences for the
United States. Milosevic has been treated by the Clinton
administration as an important keeper of the peace in Bosnia, where
U.S. troops are based, and as a negotiating partner over the future
of Kosovo, where the ethnic Albanian majority is seeking
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic rules from behind closed doors, rarely appearing in
public and almost never granting interviews, even to Yugoslav state
news media, which he controls. There has been no official
explanation of the recent dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   The purges began shortly after the departure from Belgrade of
the U.S. envoy, Richard Holbrooke, who persuaded Milosevic to agree
to international observers in Kosovo, and were preceded by the
closing of independent newspapers and academic dismissals at
Belgrade University.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of Perisic on Tuesday was perhaps the least
surprising, after he publicly criticized Milosevic last month for
allowing what is left of Yugoslavia to become a pariah state.
Yugoslavia now consists of two republics: dominant Serbia and
smaller Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic, who led the Yugoslav National Army during the
atrocities in Bosnia, was reported to have opposed the use of his
soldiers against ethnic Albanian civilians in Kosovo during the
summer offensive there. His skepticism apparently infuriated Ms.
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on Kosovo between Yugoslavia and NATO was signed
by Perisic, thus forcing Milosevic to wait a decent interval before
getting rid of him. What was surprising was Perisic's decision to
fight back.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night the general taunted Milosevic with a statement
saying he had been dismissed illegally and hinting that he was
prepared to lead Yugoslavia down a different path.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``I was replaced without consultations, in an inadequate and
illegal way,'' the general said in his statement, which was issued
through an independent news agency. ``This establishment does not
like officials with high personal integrity who use their own
heads. I am still at the disposal of the army, the people and the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisic, a native of Montenegro, is reported to have the backing
of that republic's president, Milo Djukanovic, a former Milosevic
ally who has turned against him and has won U.S. support for his
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents of Milosevic, who has thrived throughout his
11-year rule by fomenting crises, fear that with Kosovo effectively
now policed by the West and its ethnic Albanian guerrillas lying
low in winter snows, he will use the lull to provoke a
confrontation with Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Perisic was replaced by Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, a member of Ms.
Markovic's political party who was commander of one of the army
corps most active in the savage 1991 fight to wrest the city of
Vukovar from the Croatians, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The first senior official to be removed was Jovica Stanisic, the
head of state security services, whom the West considers a clever
intelligence officer. Stanisic, who knows all the dirty secrets of
Milosevic's rule, was replaced by a senior police patrol officer,
Rade Markovic, a loyalist of Ms. Markovic's and a member of her
party, known as the Yugoslav Left. Markovic is not related to Ms.
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Stanisic, a dozen top operational officers of the
security service were forced into retirement or removed, a move
that may undermine Milosevic in the longer term, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic next dismissed Milorad Vucelic, the deputy leader of
Milosevic's Socialist Party, who served as the president's
political disciplinarian.
</P>
<P>
   To complete the list, the head of the air force, Gen. Ljubisa
Velickovic, who protested Milosevic's agreement to allow NATO
surveillance flights over Kosovo, was also removed.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has carried out purges before, but never to this
extent. And he has never so obviously filled vacancies with
loyalists of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   This round is also different because it comes when there is no
obvious danger to Milosevic; the Serbian opposition, which mounted
vast months-long demonstrations two years ago, is weak and divided.
And for the first time even courtiers of the regime speak of it in
scathing terms.
</P>
<P>
   Slavko Curuvija, the editor in chief of the Daily Telegraph and
European magazine, which were closed down by the government last
month, was until recently a confidant of Ms. Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview, he described how he went to see her in
October to offer a few pessimistic predictions. ``In the next year
or next two years they will lose power,'' Curuvija said. ``They are
making a private regime in which nobody who is not a close friend
or not a bodyguard has important positions in the government.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his meeting with Ms. Markovic ended abruptly. ``I told
her that everything her husband had done was dramatically bad and
that he had to do several things to save Serbia,'' he said. ``I
said: `If you don't stop what's going on, the end will be bloody,'
and that many people will be killed and maybe some will be on
hanged on the Terazije,'' a central square in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Curuvija said the outlook for the regime was very grim indeed.
``If you make war in Slovenia, you can step back to Croatia,'' he
said, referring to Milosevic's first fights within the old
Yugoslavia. ``If you start a war in Montenegro, you can step back
to Belgrade. When you start a war in Belgrade, you have nowhere to
step back to except a trench around your house.''
</P>
<P>
   A critical factor governing how long the government will survive
is the economy, which has been battered by sanctions and bans on
loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and
continues its relentless decline.
</P>
<P>
   But so far Milosevic has managed to manipulate the currency so
that he can pay about three-quarters of the annual state pensions
due, and keep the police and army paid. And with help from Russia,
which provides natural gas even though Yugoslavia is late in its
payments, and with deals like a recent oil purchase from Libya,
Milosevic is able to provide energy for the long-suffering people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't underestimate his ability to scrape the bottom for
economic deals,'' said a Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksandar Tijanic, a former minister of information, said he
believed the government had $1 billion to $2 billion stashed abroad
that it could draw on. ``It's an enormous amount of money in this
situation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is considerable division among former members of the
Milosevic circle and Western officials who expect Milosevic to fall
about just how he will go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it will be a palace coup,'' said the Washington
official. ``It's going to be in the streets. It could develop
rapidly, something we won't anticipate _ say, superinflation should
return and dinars in the morning can't buy bread in the
afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   In Grubacic's view, ``No one can see him going from power
normally. Something will happen next year for sure. Things are
going quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of the times is that the new leader of the opposition
coalition that organized the street demonstrations two years ago is
Nebojsa Covic. Back then, he was mayor of Belgrade and a close
associate of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Covic, who describes in vivid detail Milosevic's style of
scolding underlings, including shouting at Covic and calling him a
coward, acknowledged that the opposition remained weak.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that eventually, he could not say exactly when, a
spark would come from the streets. Then, as happened in Romania, it
would be a matter of which way the mainstay of Milosevic's power,
the 90,000-member police force, would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police are more and more willing to go against him every
day,'' Covic said. ``But they want to make sure they are on the
winning side.''

GARBAGE TRUCK DRIVERS RACKING UP OVERTIME BUT PAYING THE PRICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK McGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The city's garbage truck drivers are really
cleaning up -- on overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond costing Los Angeles more than expected, city and union
officials warn that long hours behind the wheel of 12-ton trucks
are dangerous for the drivers and public alike.
</P>
<P>
   And some drivers agree -- even though 26 of them took home more
than $20,000 apiece in overtime last year and 508 of the city's 849
trash truck drivers earned more than $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Jose Gallegos took home $20,000 in overtime last year, on
top of his $39,000 salary. But Gallegos said overwork led him to
pull a muscle in his back while maneuvering his heavy truck into
the hills of the suburban West Valley on narrow streets and dirt
roads.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old said he feels mentally and physically exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely hard,'' said Gallegos, who worked 14 hours of
overtime each week. ``Most of the guys love their work, but they're
clamoring for more help. They want some relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallegos is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start the day at 5 in the morning and you don't go home
until after it's dark again, that's a lot of work,'' said Julie
Butcher, who heads the union representing drivers. ``It's
stressful. The longer they are out there each day, the more
potential there is for problems.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Rita Walters said more must be done, including
the hiring of more drivers, to reduce their overtime hours and head
off the potential of equipment mishaps or serious crashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a real problem for them to be driving those hours,''
Walters said. ``The concern is about people, their physical
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   The long hours are caused by rubble from the Northridge
Earthquake and El Nino, a 25 percent cut in the work force over the
past four years, an aging fleet of trucks that break down too much,
and a volume of refuse that has increased apace with the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Accident rates rose during the early stages of the staff cuts,
from 525 in 1994 to 666 in 1995 and 591 in 1996. However, there
were only 457 accidents last year.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Sones, a deputy director for the bureau, said the drop last
year and so far this year is largely due to the higher experience
level of the remaining drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, new safety inspection rules were adopted in 1996
after a broken hydraulic mechanism from a trash truck slammed into
a school bus, killing two 8-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime claims began to rise dramatically four years ago when
the Sanitation Bureau reduced its refuse collection staff by 172
drivers. The city provides pickup for about 25 percent of the trash
in Los Angeles, including all single-family homes and many
apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, the annual cost of overtime increased from
$5.5 million in 1994-95, at a staffing level of 1,026 drivers, to
$7 million in 1997-98, at a staffing level of 849 drivers.
</P>
<P>
   While savings from staff cuts have outweighed additional
overtime expenses, council members directed Sanitation Bureau
Director Judith Wilson to take steps to reduce the hours racked up
by drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Sanitation officials said they expected staff cuts to save more
money than they have so far.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said the bureau has already taken measures that have cut
overtime costs from last year to the first quarter of this year,
including separating each of the six sanitation yards as cost
centers that must justify expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bureau is strongly committed to minimizing the use of
overtime in its collection operations and has initiated many
actions to focus on improving and stabilizing operations with the
intent of lowering our overtime costs and staying within budgeted
funds for the current fiscal year,'' Wilson said in the report.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is also buying 57 new trucks this year to replace
some of the older vehicles that spend a lot of time in the shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Equipment breakdown is a growing problem as the fleet of
automated trucks grow,'' the report said. ``Currently (there) is an
excess of 1,000 hours of equipment failure monthly, creating a need
for overtime use which will be significantly reduced with the
replacement of the 1990-to-1992 trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Sones said he plans to hire 25 new drivers this year to fill
vacancies in the work force.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures have already produced results, with overtime
payments down in the first quarter of this year compared with last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many drivers are still working long hours, making $15,000
or more so far this year in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers union is pushing for some relief, including more
hiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point it's cheaper for the city to have drivers work
overtime than to hire new drivers, but there's got to be a
balance,'' Butcher said.

NEW L.A. COUNTY SHERIFF AIMS TO STEM TIDE OF INMATE DEATHS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA,   LEE CONDON   and DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- As Sheriff-elect Lee Baca prepares to take office
Dec. 7, he is calling for better training and supervision of
deputies in the county's jails, where five inmates have died in the
last four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more sergeants (in the jails),'' Baca said. ``We need
more training.''
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to the suburban Malibu/Lost Hills sheriff's
station last week, Baca repeated a postelection pledge to appoint
an inspector general of the jails to act as a watchdog over the
custody division.
</P>
<P>
   The job would be to ferret out problems in the system and
convince the public and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
that the department needs money to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a some problems in our jails,'' he said. ``We can't
fight our fight alone. There are parts of the county that don't
think we're doing a good job regarding our jails. I think we're
doing a fair job, but I think we can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon taking office, Baca said he plans to ask the supervisors
for enough sergeants ``to keep (the custody division) in a strong,
professional mode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What causes some levels of excessive force is we don't have
enough training and supervisors for deputies in the custody
division,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he denied that brutality is pervasive in the county jail
system.
</P>
<P>
   The county runs nine jails, holding about 22,000 inmates at any
given time and more than 200,000 inmates a year.
</P>
<P>
   So far in 1998, 36 inmates have died, compared with 48 in all of
1997, Undersheriff Jerry Harper said. There have been three
homicides this year vs. four in 1997, and four inmates have
committed suicides this year, the same number as in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Homicides include murders in the jails or deaths during inmate
altercations for which jail workers are not held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of deaths are listed as natural,'' Harper
said. ``Overall I think we're doing a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Coroner's officials said the Aug. 1 death of Twin Towers inmate
Danny Ray Smith was a homicide, although a heart condition
contributed to his death. Smith died with his hands cuffed behind
his back after being involved in an altercation with deputies.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said it was investigating the case not long after
then-Sheriff Sherman Block announced a probe in mid-August into a
``posse'' of seven or more renegade deputies at the Twin Towers
facility who allegedly used unnecessary force on an inmate and were
roughing up other mental health inmates they felt were being
``coddled.'' The deputies remain on paid leave while the
investigation continues, Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   These incidents are nothing new, said lawyers who represent
families of inmates. There is a pattern of deputy brutality, they
said, stretching back 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we see a number of deaths and a rash of them, but
we will continue to see them because nothing is being done to
forestall this conduct,'' said lawyer Eric Ferrer, who has filed a
lawsuit against the Sheriff's Department on behalf of the family of
Mark Philyaw, an inmate allegedly beaten to death at Twin Towers in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Ferrer alleges that sheriff's deputies kicked,
punched and choked Philyaw during a strip search and that he did
nothing to justify such use of force. Philyaw had been jailed on
traffic violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mark Philyaw case is typical of what we see happen to
inmates in the jails,'' said Ferrer, who practices in the law
offices of Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. ``This man was beaten
unmercifully when he didn't comply with the officers' commands. You
can wind up in jail for a minimal kind of misconduct and you can
wind up not coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the matter is in litigation, Harper declined comment on
Philyaw's case.
</P>
<P>
   Common factors among inmate death cases, Ferrer said, are
sheriff's deputies who are young and inexperienced, and sometimes
are assigned to the jails because they have had difficulties in
other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Harper disputed that assessment.
</P>
<P>
   While almost all new deputies start out in the jails, many
remain there as long as six to eight years, hardly making them
inexperienced, he said.
</P>
<P>
   They receive nine weeks of Sheriff's Academy training that
includes 144 hours focused on jail duty, Harper said. Of those, 48
hours involve the proper use of force, from handcuffing and other
restraint techniques to the use of pepper spray, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Training continues once deputies are assigned, said Harper,
adding, ``It is recurrent training.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer called for an outside investigation to put an end to a
culture within the department that he claims allows brutalizing of
inmates to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture itself is not one that's going to foster
brutality,'' said Baca, a 32-year veteran who resigned in June as a
division chief to pursue his campaign for sheriff. ``The most
frequent cause of the use of force as I'm seeing it is
overcrowdedness.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates ``are stressed out being in jail,'' and that leads to
fights that deputies must break up, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There were 64 uses of force in the Twin Towers jail in 1997,
when the inmate population was 3,200, he said. In the first six
months of 1998, when the population was at 5,000, there were 118
use-of-force cases, Baca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story we've been trying to get out is that the number of
excessive-force lawsuits and complaints has been going down in the
last few years,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Merrick Bobb, who monitors the Sheriff's Department for
the county supervisors, said in his last report, filed in June,
that excessive-force lawsuits dropped from 381 in 1992-93 to 108 in
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiscal year 1996-97 produced the lowest combined figures for
judgments, settlements, attorney's fees and costs for any year
since we began measuring in fiscal year 1992-93,'' Bobb wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Leo J. Terrell said he sees a pattern of brutality
resulting in inmate deaths at the county jails.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be full-scale investigation into this,'' he
said. ``You have to hold law enforcement officers accountable for
their misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell criticized the department for failing to punish deputies
involved in inmate deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows there's a dual system of justice,'' he said. ``If you
or I commit a crime, we're in custody within 24 hours, but if
you're a law enforcement officer, you get protection.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Standing in front of the full-length mirror, the girl
fights back tears. Her thighs are too big, her breasts too small
and her nose bumpy. Or so this 16-year-old thinks, comparing
herself with ``Baywatch'' babes and Victoria's Secret models.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, boys never call, and getting undressed
for gym is a mortification. But such problems have quick fixes, the
magazine ads promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can look better, why not?'' the girl asked during a
recent consultation with a plastic surgeon. Her parents are living
proof, she argued, her mother rejuvenated by a face lift and her
father's brow smoothed of its furrows.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was not persuaded. He said later that he had stalled
by scheduling another appointment, and that he hoped the Long
Island family did not look elsewhere in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's 40-something parents are part of a tide of affluent
baby boomers who are being tucked, peeled and augmented as never
before. But it is the teen-age girls now flocking to the suites of
plastic surgeons from Park Avenue to Beverly Hills who pose an
ethical problem for doctors who must decide whether to operate on
patients who are too young to vote, but old enough to feel social
pressures to be physically perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are capable of doing awful things to these kids,'' said Dr.
Mark Sultan, chief of plastic surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center
and one of two dozen doctors who said they are seeing more
teen-agers than ever before who are eager to change their looks and
willing to go through often painful surgery to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon's task, Sultan and others said, is to weed out
youngsters with true deformities from those responding to media
messages and peer or parental pressure. ``We have to decide what is
real, what is imagined and what is exaggerated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14,000 adolescents nationwide had cosmetic surgery in
1996, a slight increase from 1992, when the boom began, according
to data from the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons. In all age groups, 700,000 procedures were done last
year, up 70 percent in four years.
</P>
<P>
   But professionals agree that those numbers are a vast
understatement, perhaps by as much as half, since they do not
include the many procedures now done by dermatologists,
ophthalmologists, ear nose and throat specialists, dentists and
others.
</P>
<P>
   And the make-overs of choice are changing for teen-agers. A
generation ago, it was not unusual for youngsters to have their
noses straightened or ears pinned back, procedures that doctors say
are appropriate for those with ungainly features.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, more controversial procedures, like breast
augmentation, liposuction and tummy tucks, are gaining popularity
in this impressionable age group. In the New York area, these
procedures, among two dozen available, range in cost from $25,000
for liposuction to $5,000 for a tummy tuck.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, there were 5,519 nose jobs among teen-agers, 3,024 ear
operations, 978 breast implants, 472 liposuctions and no tummy
tucks. Four years later, nose jobs were down to 4,313 and ear
pinnings to 2,470. But breast augmentations were up to 1,172,
liposuctions increased to 788 and tummy tucks to 130. And many more
adolescents seeking these newer procedures were turned away by
doctors who say they rarely perform them in anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Letting Them Wait Can Solve the Problem
</P>
<P>
   Stalling is a popular tactic among doctors, who count on the
fact that teen-agers are by definition mercurial.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Nanni, for one, set out to dissuade an
overweight girl from Bay Ridge who came to him recently after many
failed attempts at diet and exercise. She was 16 years old and 5
feet 3 inches tall, and weighed 185 pounds. Her mother, divorced
and struggling on a secretary's salary, was not enthusiastic about
either the costs or the risks of liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Nanni put the girl on a sensible diet and encouraged her mother
to buy a treadmill. Come back in a year or two, he told them. If
liposuction seemed appropriate then, he would do the procedure, at
a big discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of disappointed, but it made sense,'' the girl said
grudgingly, still preferring the quick fix to the ordeal of losing
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was thrilled. ``As a parent you want your children to
be happy, so I went along with it,'' she said, describing her
daughter's misery each time they went shopping or attended a big
family gathering. But when Nanni resisted, she was relieved. ``I
respect him immensely for not just taking my money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of new procedures can be a relief to
adolescents overwhelmed by an otherwise intractable physical
disfigurement. One New Jersey teen-ager, 5 feet 4 inches tall and
weighing 220 pounds, doggedly set out to lose 100 pounds,
succeeded, and kept the weight off for more than a year. Left
behind, however, was an apron of excess skin that brought her to
the office of Dr. Gerald Pitman, who had never before treated a
girl so young.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by her resolve and her mother's silence during their
first meeting, signals that the girl was mature and self-motivated,
Pitman agreed to operate. When the girl was between the ages of 15
and 18, Pitman did a series of surgeries on her abdomen, thighs,
upper arms and breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did he make me look beautiful, he made me feel
beautiful,'' said the girl, who once wore men's size 38 jeans and
is now a sleek women's size 6. Like most of the youngsters
interviewed, she spoke on the condition, set by her parents, that
she not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey girl rarely looks at her ``before'' photos, when
she had fat rippling from her knees. But she still recalls being
``tortured'' by classmates, who called her names and shunned her
during games of spin the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would want to be with a fat disgusting girl who can't get
out of her own way?'' she said now, her hair pulled back to reveal
fine cheekbones.

<P>
   Pressure From a Parent Must Be Eliminated
</P>
<P>
   All the doctors interviewed spoke of the need to distinguish a
child's wishes from a parent's, which often requires chasing the
adult from the examining room during the initial meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Baker, a surgeon in a suburb of Orlando, Fla., the
state that is second to California in the number of plastic surgery
procedures done each year, described one such consultation
recently. The mother announced that her daughter was miserable
about her nose. The girl sat silent, staring at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you like your nose?'' the doctor asked the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother thinks it's too big.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why don't we do your mother's nose?''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the case.
</P>
<P>
   In extreme situations, doctors say, a child-abuse complaint is
filed against a parent who insists on a needless operation, since
no surgery is without medical risk.
</P>
<P>
   The general surge in cosmetic surgery has its roots in
demographics, medical technology and health-care economics. As baby
boomers hit 50, they are doing anything and everything to arrest
the ravages of age. Meanwhile, new procedures are invented and old
ones become safer and less stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
   And plastic surgeons, doing elective procedures not covered by
insurance, are aggressively marketing themselves: ``No Ifs, Ands or
Butts; You Can Change Your Bottom Line in Hours.'' Last year,
700,000 procedures were done in all age groups, a 70 percent
increase from 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge problem for the public,'' said Dr. Jane Petro,
a Westchester County plastic surgeon. ``There is enormous pressure
to do things the patient isn't going to be helped by, because
someone shows up with a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultation with a teen-age patient is a distinct art. It
generally involves repeat visits, over several months, to mitigate
impulsiveness. The negatives _ for example, scarring and loss of
sensation following breast enlargement _ are stressed. Sometimes
meetings with a therapist are required, especially when an eating
disorder is suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors say they look for red flags in body language. Does
the child smile? Interact easily with the mother? Cringe after
disrobing? Does the patient's perception of the defect match the
evidence in the mirror? Has the youngster, or the parent, had
repeated plastic surgeries?
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be able to tell me what they don't like,'' Baker
said. ``And if the answer is `I'm just ugly,' that's not good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   At heart, the doctors are trying to determine whether the
youngster's complaint is a realistic cry for help, a frivolous
attempt at perfection or a symptom of a more serious psychological
problem.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old stooping from the weight of triple-cup breasts,
for instance, ``qualifies as a medical emergency,'' said Dr. George
Beraka, a Park Avenue surgeon. By contrast, a girl ``who hates her
nose one day and her ears the next,'' he said, ``maybe needs a
psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors disagree about whether they ought to function as
therapists as well as surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``With adolescents, their ideas about their bodies change as
fast as their bodies do,'' said Dr. Nicholas Perricone, a professor
of dermatology at Yale University. ``They are facing so many
issues, so many forces from the outside. We see more neuroses than
psychiatrists.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Brennan, a plastic surgeon from Newport Beach,
Calif., balks at what seems to him psychobabble. ``I'm not
suggesting you operate on every kid who walks in the door,'' he
said. ``But it's no different than orthodontia. We didn't do
psychotherapy before we straightened a teen-ager's teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some surgeons regularly include psychologists or psychiatrists
in their consultations, to weed out patients with psychological
problems, like distorted body images. But even girls without
serious mental-health problems are often at war with their flesh in
many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body is a screen on which they project negative feelings
about themselves,'' said Dr. Ann Kearney-Cooke, a Cincinnati
psychologist and author of a curriculum to teach girls skills that
improve body image. ``If they don't know how to handle attention
from boys, they want a breast reduction. We need to spend time
teaching them to set boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls represent the majority of cases and the more ambiguous
ones. Boys usually want their ears pinned back or reduction of
enlarged breasts, a condition caused by hormone imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   The Problems Beyond Body Image
</P>
<P>
   Beyond body-image issues, some doctors say that refusing plastic
surgery for the young may toughen them for the stings and
disappointments that lie ahead. ``To teach them to deal with
adversity, they have to bump into some things in life,'' said Dr.
Susan Craig Scott, a plastic surgeon and mother of a teen-age girl.
``There is definitely something to be said for learning to deal
with the hand life gives you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, sometimes with the passage of time a cosmetic-surgery
patient may realize that the desire for such drastic change was an
immature mistake. One young woman, for instance, went to Dr.
Richard Ellenbogen in Los Angeles a few years ago, when she was a
teen-ager, because she hated her crooked nose, she said. Before she
knew it, seduced by the glossy brochures in the waiting room, she
was on a self-improvement treadmill that included surgery on her
chin, ears and breasts, along with liposuction and hair extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just a few sobering years later, she sees it was a mistake
to ``get so caught up in it'' and said she would caution a daughter
to think twice. ``I'd want her not so set on her looks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they go along with the idea of surgery, many parents
try to caution children that it is not a panacea. One father in
Greenwich, Conn., reluctantly let his 10th-grade daughter get a
nose job before she left for boarding school. Even after the
surgery, he still asks himself whether the girl's unhappiness was a
``reflection of something deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she want to change her nose, or did she want to be a
different person?'' he asked. ``I don't think we'll ever be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   He drummed his concern into the girl beforehand. ``He pounded it
into my head that I'd still be the same person,'' she said. ``If
you're a loser on the inside, you'll still be a loser on the
inside. I just thought I'd be happier, that it would make me feel
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And what has changed? ``I'm not thinking about how I look all
the time and looking in the mirror constantly,'' she said. ``But I
still have the same personality. I'm pretty much myself.''

AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION DILEMMA SPREADS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Mass., Md., Tenn., Okla., Colo., Del., Ohio, N.Y.,
N.C., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By TAMAR LEWIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Arlington, Va., when Lara Tito, a white preschooler, did not
get into the kindergarten at a popular alternative school, her
parents joined with two other families and sued the district,
challenging an admission system that set aside half of the 46 slots
for members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, the parents of Sarah Wessman, a white student
rejected from the competitive Boston Latin School when several
minority students with lower test scores were admitted, also went
to court. Last week, the parents won a ruling giving their daughter
a place and striking down the racial preferences.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery County, Md., a suburban Washington area known for
the success of the voluntary desegregation policy it adopted in
1975, school officials face two lawsuits, one challenging the
admissions policy for a program for gifted students, the other
challenging the rules that stop children from transferring from a
school if the departure will hurt the school's racial balance.
</P>
<P>
   With these cases and others across the country, the longstanding
debate over affirmative action in education, for years centered on
universities and professional schools, is shifting down to public
school districts, where an increasing number of parents _ mostly
white _ are complaining about policies they say are unfair to their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half-century after Brown vs. Board of Education, at a
time when both the courts and the voters have turned against
affirmative action, the question of whether the educational value
of diversity justifies race-conscious policies in public schools is
an open one, never directly addressed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming a pressing issue, as the desegregation orders
imposed by the courts decades ago are lifted in more and more
areas. In recent years, judges have ended desegregation orders in
Nashville, Tenn.; Oklahoma City; Denver; Wilmington, Del., and
Cleveland, ruling that the effects of past segregation had been
remedied, and no further judicial scrutiny was required.
</P>
<P>
   School lawyers say there is enormous uncertainty about whether
those districts _ and hundreds that were never under court order
but adopted voluntary desegregation plans _ can continue
race-conscious policies, and, if so, what kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an issue of great frustration to school boards, because
if there can be no consideration of race and ethnicity, many
schools that have worked very hard over the years to become diverse
will slide back to very segregated patterns,'' said Julie
Underwood, general counsel of the National School Boards
Association. ``Legally, it's very confusing now. School districts
that have had the court orders lifted really don't know if they're
going to have to drop the programs that helped them desegregate.''
</P>
<P>
   Both at schools that use weighted admissions to diversify the
student body, and at those, like New York City's Stuyvesant High
School, that have neither racial preferences nor many
African-American or Hispanic students, teachers, parents and
students are as divided over affirmative action as the nation at
large, unsure how to balance the need for diversity against the
goals of fairness and academic excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents and teachers said the legal battles were less a
measure of racial attitudes than of the struggle for a good
education at a time when so many public schools are mediocre, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   In many communities, desegregation plans included the creation
of magnet schools, which increase parent choice and attract more
applicants than can be accommodated _ but rarely a representative
share of minority families. The federal government provides special
financing for such schools under guidelines that allow
race-conscious policies if they are the only means to increase
integration and narrowly tailored to minimize the burden on other
races.
</P>
<P>
   To increase diversity without invoking lawsuits, many of these
magnet schools are broadening the factors they consider to include
not only race and ethnicity but leadership, personal achievement,
socioeconomic status and the language spoken at home. They are also
putting new energy into increasing their applicant pool by
recruiting in target neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The legal parameters of race-based policies in those schools,
and elite competitive high schools like Boston Latin, are likely to
be determined in a crop of upcoming cases.
</P>
<P>
   In Arlington, Va., in what is probably the most closely watched
case, a U.S. District Court ruling against the Arlington
Traditional School's admissions policy is being appealed to the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Though the original case produced a ruling that the school could
not set aside places for minorities and the three children involved
are now first- graders there, a new case was filed by a lawyer, the
father of one of those children, the following year on behalf of
two other families after the school adopted a lottery system giving
extra chances not only to racial minorities but also to poor
students and those for whom English is a second language.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge rejected that, too, but the Justice
Department, the National School Boards Association and other
education groups are backing the school district on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In Charlotte, N.C., site of the 1971 Supreme Court ruling
upholding court-ordered busing, the parent of a white girl denied a
place at a magnet elementary school _ at a time when, her lawyer
charges, there were empty seats for black students _ filed a
lawsuit challenging an admission policy using separate lotteries
for white and nonwhite children. That complaint has been joined to
the overall case on whether the original desegregation order should
be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery County, Md., the lawsuit on the transfer policy is
also being appealed to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   And in San Francisco, where a longstanding court decree mandates
that no more than 40 percent of the enrollment of a school be of
one ethnic group, a Chinese-American parent sued over the admission
policy at the competitive Lowell High School, where
Chinese-Americans had to score higher than other ethnic groups to
gain admission. The case, scheduled for trial next year, seeks to
dismantle the entire district's desegregation plan.

 UNDATED: desegregation plan. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lowell's admissions policy has been changed to create one cutoff
for all applicants, but for 20 percent of the class it takes into
account other factors like socioeconomic status and personal
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of affirmative action say that recent court rulings
point inescapably to the conclusion that school systems that are
not under court order to desegregate may not use any racial
preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am all for diversity, but when a school says, `You're white
so you can't come; you're African-American so you can,' that's
illegal discrimination and it's wrong,'' said Steven Levine, the
lawyer-father challenging the Arlington policy.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights advocates, however, say the legal lines are nowhere
nearly so settled, and argue that because integration remains an
important and unfilled goal of public policy, schools should have
some discretion about how to achieve it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the law is clear yet,'' said Gary Orfield, who
heads the Harvard Project on School Desegregation, which compiles
statistics on the proportion of American students in segregated
schools. ``The courts have not said that race cannot be considered
at all. And there is no question that schools still need to pay
attention to race. Our last report found that we are resegregating
at the fastest rate since the Brown decision, and I think that
trend is continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boston Latin, there is mixed feeling about racial preferences
among students and teachers alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be able to get in based on how smart they are,
not the color of their skin,'' said David Sullivan, a white
sophomore. He said he could tell the difference between students
admitted purely on their scores and those helped by their race.
``The kids from the quotas are kind of not as smart, some of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   That perception, says John Regan, an English teacher, is a
strong argument against racial preferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the kids should be admitted on the basis of their
testing scores and their GPAs,'' Regan said. ``I think that's
what's fair. The kids know that that's what's fair. Some of the
kids who are most strong in the fact that it should be just from
the exam and from the GPAs are the black kids who are tired of
being pointed at and hearing, `Oh, yeah, you just got in on special
admissions,' and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But most said they saw both sides of the argument.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Rodrigues, a black Boston Latin sophomore who came to the
United States from Cape Verde when she was 7, said she thought the
preferences were necessary. ``I would like it to be fair and
strictly on the test scores, but in the world that we live in not
everything is fair, and it's really a dream, I think, to expect
everybody to have the same opportunities to do as well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, the litigation has heightened student awareness
of racial preferences, in a negative way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any students even knew about the quota, so they
never judged each other,'' she said. ``Now they are aware of it,
and in some ways it brought down some people's sense of value of
how well they do. I don't believe that they gave me some slack on
the test. I'd rather not think about that because it would really
bring down my self-esteem and how I rate myself as a student.''
</P>
<P>
   At Boston Latin and other schools, there was also a widespread
feeling that the best way to encourage diversity would be by
improving the public schools, so that minority students from poor
neighborhoods would be as well prepared as more affluent whites.
</P>
<P>
   At Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan, Wesley Mathewson, a
white 15-year-old sophomore, attributed the minimal representation
of black and Hispanic students at his school to the inadequacy of
so many public elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not getting a good education in minority
neighborhoods, so the odds of passing the test are stacked against
them,'' he said. ``They have a disadvantage.'' Although he wishes
his school were more diverse, he said, racial preferences would not
be a good answer. ``You can't randomly admit blacks and Hispanics
without taking away from what the school prides itself on, a
tradition of excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Arlington Traditional School, where press clippings about
the court fight are posted near the front door next to photos of
the science fair, several parents said the real issue was finding
enough places in academically sound schools. They said the
litigation had been a hot issue at the school but not particularly
divisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't blame the people for suing,'' said Elena Manville, a
white parent of a kindergarten student at the school. ``Everyone is
hoping to get their kid in here.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers challenging racial preferences say that is a
separate issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the schools stink, people should confront that problem,
rather than engage in racial bean-counting,'' said Daniel Girard,
the lawyer handling the challenge to the San Francisco
desegregation order, adding that schools will become more diverse
as the nation generally moves in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, say that schools should be able to take action
to increase diversity in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is even more important than busing, which was always seen
as a remedy, based entirely on the legal issue that separate but
equal had to be changed,'' said August Steinhilber, a Maryland
lawyer who represents school boards. ``This goes to the next stage,
the educational issue _ that it's critical for youngsters to
understand that they live in a society that's racially and
ethnically mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``But because of the court decisions, everyone's getting very
shy. School people say they feel like their hands are tied. We're
down to the last straw. If you can't do anything about student
assignment unless you're under court order, there's nothing left of
affirmative action at the elementary and secondary level.''

BOTH SIDES JOCKEYING TO INFLUENCE PRESIDENT'S FATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the House impeachment inquiry enters its crucial
final weeks, Republicans and Democrats are jockeying for an
advantage that could influence President Clinton's fate.
</P>
<P>
   What little hope Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee
had that Clinton would give any ground vanished on Friday, when in
responses to 81 questions from the committee, the president once
again insisted _ this time in terse, formal written replies _ that
he did not lie under oath, tamper with witnesses or obstruct
justice to conceal his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans were not satisfied. ``There's a lot of legal
gymnastics in these answers,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, an
Arkansas Republican on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning on Monday, committee Republicans aim to shore up their
case against Clinton by taking several steps. Committee lawyers
will take sworn statements from three witnesses about whether they
tried to influence Kathleen Willey, a former White House volunteer
who has said the president made an unwanted advance to her just
outside the Oval Office in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the committee will hold a public hearing on the
consequences of lying under oath. Nearly a dozen federal judges,
retired military officers, law professors and convicted perjurers
are scheduled to testify.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's senior staff is drawing up three articles of
impeachment against the president. The possible counts are perjury,
obstruction of justice and witness tampering, and abuse of power.
Republican committee aides say a perjury count has the best shot at
passing the House, and even that would be on a cliffhanger vote.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican committee aide said on Friday that the panel
would likely vote to send each count to the House floor separately,
rather than wrap the articles into one resolution. This was done in
1974, when three articles of impeachment against President Richard
Nixon were reported out of committee on three separate days.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing on Tuesday, Republicans may also subpoena one
or two more witnesses, or additional documents, in an effort to
show a wider pattern of abuse beyond the Lewinsky case. The
committee may also vote to release evidence under seal, including a
videotape of the deposition Clinton gave on Jan. 17 in the sexual
misconduct lawsuit by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts of the most damaging portions of the deposition have
already been made public, Republican aides acknowledge, but some
committee officials were urging the release of the tape itself. One
reason is to rebut Clinton's assertion that he could not be held
responsible for the representation that his lawyer, Robert Bennett,
made about Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit, because he was not paying
close attention.
</P>
<P>
   In the deposition, Bennett asserted that the affidavit showed
that there ``is absolutely no sex of any kind in any manner, shape
or form with President Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement before the committee on Oct. 6, David
Schippers, the Republicans' chief investigative counsel, said that
the videotape of the deposition shows that the president was
``apparently listening intently to the interchange.''
</P>
<P>
   But the last time the Republicans insisted on releasing a
videotape _ of the president's testimony before the federal grand
jury in August _ it backfired, fueling public sentiment that the
inquiry was biased and politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   All this maneuvering would set the stage for the inquiry's final
two climactic weeks. In the week of Dec. 7, Rep. Henry Hyde of
Illinois, the Judiciary Committee chairman, has invited the
president's lawyer, David Kendall, to present his case, followed
later in the week by presentations from Schippers and his
Democratic counterpart, Abbe Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   By then, draft articles of impeachment would be circulating
among committee members. The 21 Republicans and 16 Democrats would
meet over two to three days to debate and vote on each article, as
well as on amendments. Democrats are expected to offer a motion to
censure the president for misconduct, rather than impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   If the committee stays on schedule, one or more articles of
impeachment would go to the House floor for a vote in the week of
Dec. 14.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As committee Republicans try to build support for impeachment,
the White House and its congressional allies are trying to mount
support for something less than impeachment, such as a resolution
of censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some Democrats who are against impeachment who'd
like to go on the record as disapproving the president's conduct,''
said Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, the newly chosen third-ranking
House Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But 100 or so Republicans may vote against censure because it is
insufficient or unconstitutional, Republican aides say. Leading the
charge against censure is Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the House
Republican whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people need to ask after a censure resolution has
been passed: What justice has been done?'' DeLay said.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment fails on the House floor, DeLay may face strong
pressure from rank-and-file Republicans, especially moderates, to
rebuke the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some moderates just aren't convinced there's an impeachable
offense,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who is undecided on how he
would vote. ``But they don't want to come away having done
nothing.''

   GLASGOW, Scotland _ The questions were delivered in brash and
burry Glaswegian tones. Who created the television, the telephone,
penicillin, the bicycle, pneumatic tires, the breech-loading rifle,
beta blockers and Oxford University?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was the same in every case: a Scot.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Gibson, 37, a Scottish Nationalist candidate for a seat
in the new Scottish Parliament, was exuberantly running through his
party's emboldened pitch aimed at convincing voters that Scotland
is inventive and accomplished enough to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and his party are campaigning for election to the new
Scottish Parliament in May on a platform of taking Scotland out of
the United Kingdom and declaring it a fully independent country.
The movement is attracting far more support than anyone ever
imagined it would.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottish Nationalist Party has until now been thought more
relevant to Brigadoon than to Britain. Its leaders, long regarded
as provincial mischief-makers in kilts, have included Billy Wolfe,
who was forever breaking into his political speeches to declaim
Highland poetry, and Winifred Ewing, a tartan eccentric in the
European Parliament in Strasbourg affectionately nicknamed Madame
Ecosse.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with Alex Salmond, 43, a onetime banker amply endowed
with cheeky cultural references and sound bites, at their helm, and
with new political power coming here from the British Parliament in
London, the Nationalists are seriously challenging the Labor
Party's traditional domination of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we achieve independence,'' he likes to say, ``England
will lose a surly lodger and gain a good neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of the Nationalist upstarts has spread alarm through
the corridors of 10 Downing Street in London, where officials
compare the Labor Party's performance to a soccer team that takes
its eye off the ball for the first half and has to mount an
aggressive retaliation in the second. The coach himself, Prime
Minister Tony Blair, has come to Scotland twice in recent weeks to
warn voters that what the Nationalists are championing is not
independence but separatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take my own case,'' he told an audience at Strathclyde
University in downtown Glasgow. ``Born in Scotland, lived most of
my life in England, of an Irish mother and an English father, both
raised in Scotland. We are bound together. Why set us apart? Why
divide even our own families from each other? What manner of
backward thinking would contemplate such a thing?''
</P>
<P>
   What has caused the alarm are poll results this summer that
showed the Nationalists running 14 percentage points ahead of Labor
in the elections for the new Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Labor found the timing particularly galling. The founding of a
new legislature in Scotland, part of the ``devolution'' to transfer
local powers from London to the regions of Britain, was a pledge on
which the Labor Party quickly delivered after coming to power 18
months ago. In a September 1997 referendum in Scotland, 74 percent
approved the new legislature, which will have law-making and taxing
powers over strictly domestic matters.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Party leaders said at the time that they believed that
this was the best way to end Scots' flirtation with independence.
Now they are finding that it has had the exact opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought that people would be so grateful, but when we got
a taste of power, it only made us want more,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in sentiment for a total break with London also comes
at a time when the British government has put Scots in some of its
most powerful posts. They include Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown; Foreign Secretary Robin Cook; Defense Minister George
Robertson; Social Security Minister Alistair Darling; and Scottish
Secretary Donald Dewar.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if this were not good reason to remain closer to London,
Gibson slyly turned the evidence back on itself. ``It just proves
how capable Scots are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Labor climbed back into a narrow lead in the polls
here, and more trips by Blair and his Cabinet members are planned
to keep up the momentum. Commentators have joined in, roused by the
pugnacious tone of the debate to assert their belief in Scottish
and British compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Neil, editor of The Scotsman and a former editor of The
Sunday Times in London, wrote an article in The Spectator saying
that as a Scot who was proud of being British, he felt like a
stranger in his own land. He complained that with the hardening of
the nationalist face, anti-English invective had moved from soccer
and rugby rivalries to bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   In several instances in Scotland that caught the attention of
newspapers published in London, Englishmen won settlements in
workplace discrimination cases. In one horrific case, an English
teen-ager was beaten to death by Scottish youths who said they did
not like his accent.
</P>
<P>
   The backlash in England has been fueled by resentment over the
disproportionately high amount of aid for education, health and
transportation that Scotland receives. The British government has
always argued that Scotland's needs are greater because of its
remoteness, its foul weather and the inhospitable nature of its
land. English critics can be heard more often these days saying it
comes simply from Scotland's appetite for state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the enthusiasm for the Nationalists could have to do
with the party's attentions to local problems at a time when many
Labor district councils are notorious for corruption and
complacency. Gibson conceded the point but added, ``We are an
independence party, and everyone who votes for us knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that if the Nationalists succeeded in gaining control
of the new Parliament, they would hold a referendum on Scottish
independence within four years.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The country the Nationalists envision would be a nation with its
own prime minister and government, its own diplomats abroad and
membership in the European Union and the United Nations. But in a
recent meeting with Charles, the Prince of Wales, Salmond said he
would want to maintain a ceremonial link with the British monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Labor may have been expecting gratitude for having given
Scotland its first Parliament in almost 300 years, but in Salmond's
skillful image manipulation, it became instead the party that
represents English control.
</P>
<P>
   Where Scots once fought the English with swords, truncheons and
longbows, Salmond, a former oil analyst for the Royal Bank of
Scotland, goes into battle with a calculator. He argues that
Scotland has abundant natural resources in oil, gas, water and
coal, a robust finance and insurance sector, a skilled work force
and a worldwide reputation in higher education and research.
</P>
<P>
   The British government may be having some success at stemming
the Nationalist fervor, but the Scots' blood is still up. The
blue-and-white Cross of St. Andrew flags that are symbols of
nationhood have been springing up as abundantly this year as the
seasonal heather and gorse.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalism is not only flying its colors in public; it lurks in
the private comments and muttered asides of growing numbers of the
5.2 million people who live in this blustery land.
</P>
<P>
   One recent night, a small group of visitors went to the roof of
the new Museum of Scotland under construction in Edinburgh to
admire Edinburgh Castle bathed in early evening illumination. A
Union Jack fluttered and snapped in the high wind above its main
turret.
</P>
<P>
   The stirring sight was interrupted by the tour guide, George
Dalgleish, a curator. ``We'll haul that down fast,'' he said with a
Braveheart laugh.

HEART DISEASE DEATHS MORE COMMON IN APPALACHIA, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: W.Va., Tenn., Ala., Miss., Ky.)  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Residents of Appalachia, one of the poorest areas
of the United States, are more likely to die from heart disease
than people living elsewhere, a new study by researchers at West
Virginia University has found.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of the 100-page report, ``Heart Disease in
Appalachia: An Atlas of County Economic Conditions, Mortality and
Medical Care Resources,'' say that a lack of medical facilities
throughout the region and a lack of emphasis on good nutrition and
exercise contribute to a higher level of heart problems in
Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Barnett, an assistant professor at the West Virginia
University school of medicine who led the study group, said
researchers found that white Appalachians between ages 35 and 64
had a 15 percent to 20 percent greater chance of dying from heart
disease than white Americans living elsewhere. Researchers also
found that although heart disease deaths declined nationally and in
Appalachia, they declined less in Appalachia.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that heart disease death rates among Appalachian
blacks, who tend to live in urban areas, especially in Alabama and
Mississippi, were closer to national averages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnett also said that because of Appalachia's poor economic
conditions, the sparsely populated communities common to the area
are less likely to provide residents recreational facilities and
more healthful foods that are routinely available in more densely
populated areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a resource to be used to implement programs and
policies to prevent heart disease,'' she said in an interview. ``By
identifying how the area counties in the area compare to each
other, we hope it will be useful to policy-makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Appalachia sweeps southwest from western New York state deep
into the South, to include 399 counties in 13 states. It has
historically reflected problems of the rural poor, especially those
whose livelihoods come from small family farms and coal mining.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent years has the region begun to diversify, with
many states seeking new industries, like timber, tourism,
technology and automobile parts plants.
</P>
<P>
   But many bad physical and nutritional habits persist, leading to
coronary disease and death.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barnett, who has taught at the university for three years,
said the researchers tracked trends in heart disease and
cardiac-related deaths from 1980 through 1993.
</P>
<P>
   She said they discovered the highest mortality rates in middle
Appalachia _ central West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, western
Virginia and northern Tennessee _ a region where coal once ruled
but that now suffers from high unemployment, low income and limited
availability of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The research also found that the region lacked resources to aid
people who have experienced heart disease and would benefit from
exercise and nutritional programs and stress management classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of counties in Appalachia do not have cardiac
rehabilitation units or coronary care units,'' Ms. Barnett said.
``Half of all initial heart attacks are fatal, so for those who
survive, they still have a high risk for a second one.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is scheduled to be published Monday in the Centers
for Disease Control's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.

   KANKANI, India _ So the legend goes, 363 nature-loving Bishnoi
villagers had their heads lopped off in 1730 as they hugged their
beloved trees. A local maharajah had sent his army to cut timber,
and when a woman named Amrita Devi stood in their way, soldiers
decapitated her and threatened to do the same to anyone else so
bold. Hundreds of others then embraced the trees in a sequence of
defiant sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, this lore was little known outside the sandy
scrub of the Rajasthan desert. Now, however, the Bishnoi have
become national heroes in an ecological morality play that pits
simple farmers against an Indian movie idol loathsomely playing
against type.

   Shortly after midnight on Oct. 1, the people of Kankani were
awakened by gunshots and, as is their custom, bolted out of bed to
chase after yet another group of hunters. The desert is prime
habitat for a small, lithe antelope known as the black buck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw their jeep race by, and my head filled up with anger,''
said Prahlad Ram, 68. ``We all began to shout and scramble. They
had already killed the bucks. These animals are sacred to us, and
we consider their lives more important than even our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Two villagers on scooters got close enough to read the vehicle's
license number. They also thought they recognized the driver as
Salman Khan, a popular young actor who had been in the area making
one of his mega-action, heavy-carnage movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``No man, no matter how powerful, should be above the law,''
said Choka Ram, 70, another village elder. ``Had we caught him, we
would have beaten him severely.''
</P>
<P>
   Beating is sometimes the preferred Bishnoi method of justice,
though authorities have tried to convince the Bishnoi that
punishment is better left to the courts. This is viewed skeptically
in villages like Kankani. While the enforcement of Indian wildlife
laws has been decidedly slack, the prosecution of alleged violators
very often has been an outright sham.
</P>
<P>
   That seemed to be the way the Salman Khan case was about to go.
The state's chief veterinarian did a postmortem examination of two
black bucks and found the cause of one death to be ``overeating''
while attributing the other to a mistimed leap.
</P>
<P>
   The Bishnoi were outraged, which is usually of little import.
This time, however, celebrity and status _ ordinarily so useful in
pulling strings _ put the accused into a worse bind.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers love to write about Khan, and the front-page
publicity pressured wildlife officials to have the bucks
re-examined. After further inspection, it was determined not only
that the animals had suffered fatal bullet wounds but also that the
state veterinarian was involved in a cover-up and subject to
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salman Khan will be found guilty, I assure you,'' said M.N.
Sonal, deputy chief of the wildlife division. ``We have
eyewitnesses. We have signed statements.''
</P>
<P>
   As details became public, Khan's macho, quick-draw persona, so
riveting on film, seemed only revolting in real life. He came to
symbolize the callous rich, people untroubled by conscience, who
take pleasure in donning night-vision glasses and poaching
endangered species like the Bengal tiger and Sarus crane.
</P>
<P>
   The movie star had been on two hunting expeditions the week
before, said Sonal, citing witnesses' accounts. During one, female
co-stars were said to have applauded giddily as the actor slit the
throat of a wounded chinkara, an Indian gazelle. Then, back at the
luxury hotel in Jodhpur, Sonal said, Khan awakened the kitchen
staff, ordering chefs to slake his appetite with the forbidden
meat.
</P>
<P>
   The actor was arrested on Oct. 12 and has steadfastly denied all
the charges. At an initial hearing he seemed carefree, joking with
friends and talking on his mobile phone. He did not appear to fear
the possibility of one to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements made against my client are all open to
question,'' said one of Khan's lawyers, Jagdeep Dhankar. ``Either
they have been made by people also accused of crimes with their own
offenses to consider, or they have been made by the Bishnoi, people
whose attraction to wildlife _ even worship of it _ twists their
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, as moviegoers developed second thoughts about
Khan's active trigger finger, the Bishnoi, who are primarily grain
farmers, were being hailed for the harmonious ways of their
500-year-old beliefs. One much-reprinted, old and grainy photo
showed a Bishnoi woman purportedly breast-feeding an orphaned deer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, such things have been known to happen,'' Prahlad Ram, the
village elder, said of the picture. ``Between us and the animals
there is complete trust. Our teachings tell us that we must serve
as protectors and nurturers of all living things.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Essentially Hindu, the Bishnoi are followers of Jhambaji, a
15th-century guru who honed his wisdom into 29 precepts. In the
canon are common proscriptions against using intoxicants or eating
meat. There are also rules commending bathing and meditation, and
yet others instilling a rare reverence for living things that
forbids even the breaking of a twig.
</P>
<P>
   In Bishnoi villages near Jodhpur, the homes often are red brick
with ornate doors and grates that display relative prosperity. The
elders complain that the next generation is insufficiently faithful
to the 29 rules, but it is the young who are quickest to light out
after hunters. Two years ago, one youth, Nihal Chand, was shot and
killed while giving chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is now among our great martyrs,'' said Prahlad Ram. ``He is
a true descendant of Amrita Devi and the others, who died with
their arms around our great friends the trees.''

GIANTS STADIUM IS LIKELY TO GO NATURAL, TURNING TURF INTO GRASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been experimental summer grass fields at Giants
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., where for 23 football seasons the
playing surface has been artificial. But the installation of a
permanent grass field _ the hope of athletes and sporting purists
alike _ has always been considered too risky for the only stadium
that is home to two National Football League teams.
</P>
<P>
   No one has had the daring to spend $3.5 million on a high-tech
grass field, then watch as New Jersey's most public lawn tries to
remain green beneath the wear and tear of 25 football games and 45
assorted other events, from rock concerts to marching band
competitions, in an average year.
</P>
<P>
   But in a New Jersey boardroom on Tuesday, officials of the New
York Giants, New York Jets, soccer's MetroStars and the New Jersey
Sports and Exposition Authority will meet, prepared to take the
grass gamble. Most of the principals involved in that decision
believe it is likely Giants Stadium will be a grass-only facility
by next football season.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it will be the first American sports facility to have a
revolutionary portable field that is a patchwork quilt of 6,400
plastic trays, heated and cooled year-round with a subterranean
system of air ducts supplied by boilers and compressors assembled
beneath the grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Clark, whose Delhi, N.Y., company has installed and
maintained temporary grass fields for soccer games and three NFL
preseason games at Giants Stadium, has presented the sports
authority with an elaborate proposal for a grass tray field that he
said would weather years of play.
</P>
<P>
   Insuring the field's durability, Clark said, is the tray system,
which allows for worn portions of the field to be replaced by trays
of fresh grass periodically during the year.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said, however, that he needed an answer soon _ certainly
by mid-December _ because it would take several months to install
the field's infrastructure and to manufacture the trays and grow
the grass.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of the Giants, Jets and the sports authority met last
week to discuss Clark's proposal. The intent of Tuesday's meeting
is to determine whether the remaining questions about converting
from artificial turf to grass can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   If they are, it will reflect a trend toward grass fields around
the NFL. Half of the league's 30 teams have grass fields and half
have artificial turf (including 8 that play in domes or partially
enclosed fields), but outdoor stadiums built in recent years _ for
Baltimore, Carolina, Jacksonville, Tampa Bay and Washington _ all
have grass, as will the stadium being built in Nashville for the
Tennessee Oilers. And Chicago, Kansas City and New England have
converted from artificial turf to grass in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   The players are in favor of the development because many of them
believe that artificial surfaces promote injuries ranging from turf
burns to ligament damage and concussions, even though the makers of
artificial turf, and even some of its critics, say there is no
medical proof that the surface causes many of those injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because grass is the favored surface for virtually all
players, a grass field is also considered an asset for teams trying
to attract free agents.
</P>
<P>
   John Mara, the Giants' vice president and senior counsel, has
concerns about upkeep of a grass field, its cost and its
availability for an occasional Giants practice (the team has a
separate grass practice field), but nonetheless aligns himself in
the pro-grass camp.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars, who already play their home games at Giants
Stadium on a temporary grass field and incur most of the cost for
it, are resolutely in favor of year-round grass.
</P>
<P>
   The sports authority's president, Dennis Robinson, said Friday
that he still had questions about whether a grass field would allow
the stadium to function as it had in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, would we have the ability to have back-to-back
football games on consecutive days as we do now?'' Robinson asked.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews with each of the major participants involved
in the decision, there was a feeling that the sports authority
would go along with the wishes of its major tenants, the Giants and
Jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is that we meet the needs of the teams,'' said
Robinson, whose office will be the scene of Tuesday's meeting.
``Their opinion is something we would weigh heavily.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may make the Jets the wild card. The Jets, whose practice
complex and offices are on Long Island, have always had a
hard-to-define role at Giants Stadium, a place they visit just 10
times a year. Over the years, the Jets, unlike the Giants, have
rarely been drawn into the artificial turf-vs.-grass debate.
</P>
<P>
   Jets president Steve Gutman said Friday that he expected
Tuesday's meeting to clarify many issues involving the Jets'
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's feasible, we'd like to try grass,'' Gutman said. ``But
there are a lot of points of view and it's very complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutman said he did not know what the decision would be, but he
did not think the Jets would end up in a position that countered
the wishes of the other parties involved. ``I can't believe we
would come to that,'' Gutman said. ``I'd be surprised if we
couldn't make the kind of decision that everybody is comfortable
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the decision will involve who pays an estimated $3.5
million to $4 million for the installation of the field.
Maintenance for the grass field would be approximately $500,000
annually. The current maintenance of the artificial turf, which
normally requires no more than periodic cleaning, is minimal. One
scenario calls for the four parties to divide the installation cost
evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things, and others, are the things that have to be
negotiated,'' Mara said last week.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that is certain: The current artificial surface,
installed at Giants Stadium last spring, would remain underneath
any grass field in case something went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Clark hurriedly laid a temporary grass field
over what was then a new artificial surface, a fungus seeped onto
the artificial turf and caused it to disintegrate. Clark had to
reimburse the sports authority about $1 million for replacing the
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   That episode is one of the reasons Clark is insisting on getting
an answer from the sports authority and the teams as early as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is too much to do,'' Clark said. ``The trays have to be
made in England. The grass has to be grown. We're going to have
rubber trays installed in the areas near the team benches and where
the television cameras roam back and forth. There are some patent
rights issues, and we're trying some things that haven't been done
before on a large scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they say, `Let's do it' at this meeting, then I'll do it
and it'll work. They can play back-to-back games on it, and with
the use of some common sense they can practice on it from time to
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of things can be worked out; I just want everybody on the
same page. I'm not going to convince them. I have Giants season
tickets, I don't want to go down there eight times a year and have
people pointing the finger at me. I want people to be happy. Who
knows which way they're going to decide, but look, I would be
surprised if they were calling me down there for a cup of coffee.''

OUTDOORS: A FAMILIAR POND THAT NEVER CEASES TO SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (bl) 
 By NELSON BRYANT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST TISBURY, Mass. _ In late October and early November, my
grandson Jesse Child and I went after the young bluefish, or
snappers, that had been trapped in Tisbury Great Pond when its
opening to the ocean closed in early August. On our first trip we
finally found them on a shallow flat against the barrier beach on
the pond's west end. They were small, about 8 inches long.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefish are ocean spawners. Some spawn in late spring or early
summer offshore far south of New England, others move north and
begin their procreative endeavors several weeks later. The fish we
caught that day were clearly the offspring of the late spawners.
</P>
<P>
   We kept a dozen of them to pan fry for supper, and the results
were so pleasing that we decided to try again. We had also been
titillated by Jesse's capture of a fish much more common in
southern waters, a species of jack crevalle known as the blue
runner. The blue runner and the snappers would have departed for
points offshore and south weeks before, had not the pond been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, we reasoned, there might be other summer visitors that
had been similarly detained. We already knew that striped bass were
among them.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked behind a narrow barrier beach that separates it from the
Atlantic, Tisbury Great Pond on Martha's Vineyard Island is many
things to many people.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, canoeists use it, and the bright sails of Sunfish and
other small craft crisscross its surface. In fall and winter,
commercial oystermen are at work, and waterfowlers huddle in its
coves and marshes waiting for mallards, bluebills, teal, black
ducks and Canada geese. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The pond has permanent populations of blue claw crabs,
silverside minnows, mummichogs, shrimp, white perch and eels.
Spawning alewives visit it in spring and a few brook trout may be
found in the coves fed by its two major streams, Mill Brook and
Tiasquam River.
</P>
<P>
   The pond _ if one discounts the major coves on its east shore _
is about two miles long and three-quarters of a mile wide, and is
opened to the ocean two or three times each year by man, when rain
and its feeder brooks have filled it to the brim. Eventually, it is
closed by onshore storms and shifting sands. In years past, gangs
of men and boys with shovels cut through the beach. Today a
bulldozer does the job.
</P>
<P>
   The most important reason for these periodic openings is to
maintain the proper salinity for the pond's oysters, soft-shelled
clams and crabs. The torrent of relatively warm brackish water,
laden with forage fish and crabs, pouring into the ocean on the
falling tides attracts striped bass and bluefish in late spring,
summer and fall. Some of these predators enter the pond and range
throughout it.
</P>
<P>
   The snapper blues that Jesse and I caught had gone into the pond
to feed on bait fish and to escape the predation of larger fish,
including their own kind.
</P>
<P>
   Bluefish and stripers of all ages are sometimes trapped in the
pond much of the winter. I recall one occasion in late November
when, while setting out a dozen duck decoys in one of the pond's
major coves, I was startled by a shower of silverside minnows being
pursued by blues of almost 2 pounds. (Tisbury Great Pond would be a
splendid natural laboratory for a fisheries biologist interested in
measuring the bluefish's capacity to survive and thrive in
low-salinity water.)
</P>
<P>
   Those who live on or near the pond are aware of the fish it
often holds captive. During World War II, about two weeks after my
parachute infantry division jumped into Holland in September, my
company was pulled off the front lines for a few days of rest in an
apple orchard, where I received a V-Mail letter from my father, who
wrote that he was catching 5-pound striped bass on his flyrod at
the mouth of the pond's Deep Bottom Cove.
</P>
<P>
   On our second visit to the pond this fall, Jesse and I
discovered that the snappers weren't where they had been on our
first trip, so we beached our canoe and walked along the shore,
each in a different direction, casting small silver jigs every few
yards. Jesse, who is a skilled and persistent angler, found the
snappers before we were a half mile apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gramp, they are twice as big as the ones we caught the other
day,'' he said as I came up to him.
</P>
<P>
   They averaged three-quarters of a pound, and we soon had enough
for a substantial repast for both households. We also caught six or
seven striped bass, the largest about 20 inches. They were far
short of the minimum length limit of 28 inches, but they were
challenging on our ultralight spinning rods.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the day heavy clouds gathered, the southwest wind picked
up, whitecaps formed on the pond and I was about to suggest that we
head for home when I hooked a fish that felt like neither a
bluefish nor a striper. As I was pondering its identity it jumped
three times, looking very much like an adult shad. It was, I
discovered after beaching it, a hickory shad of more than 2 pounds.
We caught five more of them in the next half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the pond had surprised me. The shad were my first
taken from its waters. They might have wandered in after spawning
in some stream on nearby Cape Cod, only to have the door close
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to experiment with smoking shad, I kept four of them and
we raced the gathering murk across the pond as small flocks of
westward-bound green-winged teal went by overhead.

CRIME IS KEY AS SWISS VOTE ON LEGALIZING HARD DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The Swiss are voting Sunday on whether to legalize
everything from marijuana to heroin and cocaine, a measure that _
if passed _ would give Switzerland the most sweeping
decriminalization of drug use, possession and production in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials are warning that a yes vote could turn this
tranquil Alpine nation into a ``paradise for the Mafia,'' and a
magnet for ``drug tourists,'' attracted by readily available hard
and soft drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the drug legalization initiative, led by a group
of Socialists and medical doctors, argue that it could break up
Switzerland's flourishing black market in drugs and save the
country hundreds of millions of dollars in law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   They propose to give every Swiss resident over 18 an electronic
credit card to withdraw a specified amount of drugs. The dosage
would be set in consultation with a doctor or other medical
professional, but no psychological or medical treatment would be
mandated. Only those younger than 18 would be required to see a
drug counselor before receiving an access card.
</P>
<P>
   The card, explained a Zurich physician, David Winizki, an
originator of the concept, ``would be like making a withdrawal from
a bank cash terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The dose would be programmed in,'' he continued. ``The
consumer would run the card with its magnetic strip through the
machine and the drug store would supply, for example, a gram of
heroin for 12 Swiss francs.'' A gram of heroin or cocaine now costs
about $36 on the street and 12 Swiss francs equals about $8.70.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, a user could withdraw drugs daily, or up to one
week's supply, for an amount lower than current street rates.
Winizki, who lives near the area of Zurich once known as ``Needle
Park'' for its gathering of heroin addicts, said he began working
on the idea in 1992 when he saw ``people dying every day from
overdoses and hepatitis and that made me very angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls indicate that only about 40 percent of Swiss
support the liberalization idea. That would suggest passage is
unlikely. But the drug issue pervades Switzerland, where federal
statistics count between 30,000 and 36,000 narcotics addicts, most
of them using heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates indicate that 500,000 Swiss _ of a total population of
7 million _ routinely use cannabis, and initiative supporters
believe that even if their measure is defeated on Sunday, the
widespread debate over it will clear the way for legalization of
cannabis.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A leading Swiss magazine, L'Illustre, found in a recent poll
that even among those polled who oppose Sunday's legalization
initiative, 40 percent would back the legal sale of cannabis for
people over 18, and 51 percent its sale for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other European countries that tolerate cannabis
consumption, Switzerland pursues and punishes it. Last year, four
out of five arrests were for marijuana and hashish use. Penalties
range from one day to three months in jail for second-time users,
and up to three years for heavy users, according to federal police.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials say they fear that drug liberalization will
eviscerate their efforts to address Switzerland's serious drug
problem. Figures from the European Monitoring Center for Drugs and
Drug Addiction in Lisbon suggest that drug use in Switzerland is
among the highest in Europe, eclipsed only by Italy, Spain and tiny
Luxembourg in drug use per 1,000 adults.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland's drug problems were exposed when authorities
experimented with open access to drugs in Zurich beginning in 1989.
When drug dealing and violence escalated, Swiss officials abandoned
the free needles and syringes and began an experimental program to
dispense heroin to a controlled group of hard-core addicts. This
controversial effort survived a ballot challenge last year, when an
unexpectedly high 71 percent endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say they fear, though, that legalization will
make it harder to curb hard drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Switzerland would become a paradise for the Mafia,'' said
Thomas Zeltner, who heads the federal health department.
</P>
<P>
   The country would end up isolated from international
crime-fighting efforts, and money laundering would increase, said
Valentin Roschacher, the federal anti-drug chief. ``You can't fight
organized crime without partners,'' he said in a telephone
interview from the capital, Bern.
</P>
<P>
   Zeltner noted that the number of new drug users was down,
treatment was up and overdose deaths, addict-related crime and new
HIV cases also had decreased markedly, and urged voters not to
jeopardize such gains. The poll by L'Illustre suggested support for
Sunday's measure rested largely on the belief that it would curb
crime.

POLICE ACTIONS AT PROTEST PLAGUE CANADA'S GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ It started out as little more than a brief spot on the
nightly news, but the treatment of protesters at an international
conference in Vancouver last year has turned into a recurring
political nightmare for Prime Minister Jean Chretien and his
government.
</P>
<P>
   The latest casualty was Solicitor General Andy Scott, Canada's
top law enforcement official, who resigned last week after he was
overheard talking about an investigation into the protest with the
person sitting next to him on an Air Canada flight.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the opposition in the House of Commons contend that
Chretien and his closest aides had directed the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police to be aggressive in keeping protesters away from
former President Suharto of Indonesia during last year's
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   When protesters refused to leave a roadway where Suharto was
expected to pass, the Mounties forced them out, dousing them with
irritating pepper spray. The episode was recorded by a news
cameraman, and was replayed on the nightly news, but not
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   Little happened until this fall, when reports appeared
suggesting that Chretien had tried to keep Suharto from being
embarrassed during the meeting and had ordered the Mounties to
control protesters aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   In the daily question periods in the House of Commons, Chretien
was repeatedly criticized. He tried to deflect some of the
criticism by joking that being hit with pepper spray was better
than being hit with a baseball bat. Few people laughed.
</P>
<P>
   A special panel was established to look into the actions of the
prime minister and police. The inquiry panel revealed electronic
messages between the protesters and Terry Milewski, one of the
reporters who covered the story for the CBC _ which receives most
of its funding from the federal government. In the exchanges,
Milewski tries to gain the protesters' confidence by appearing to
be sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien's office accused Milewski of bias and filed a complaint
with a news media ombudsman. The reporter was taken off the story,
and when he wrote about the incident for a local newspaper he was
temporarily suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry itself came to a halt when the government refused to
pay lawyers fees for the protesters. It was supposed to resume last
week, but a judge put it off indefinitely while charges of bias
against one of the three panel members are investigated.
</P>
<P>
   While the inquiry was running into trouble in Vancouver, an
opposition member of Parliament told reporters in Ottawa that he
was seated near the solicitor general on a flight when he overheard
him tell another passenger that police would probably have to take
the blame for what happened in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation suggested that Scott had prejudged it. The
solicitor general's casual handling of sensitive matters also
raised doubts about his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   When confronted by reporters, Scott denied everything. He said
he could not even remember the name of the person sitting next to
him.
</P>
<P>
   But the other passenger was identified as Frederick Toole, a
lawyer from Scott's home province of New Brunswick. Toole filed an
affidavit corroborating what the opposition member had said about
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Scott resigned a few days later.

   CHICAGO: A WINNING CANDIDATE ASPIRES TO A NEW JOB
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rush has been on the national stage, off and on, for the
better part of 30 years. And now he has his eye on a bigger role.
</P>
<P>
   He started out as a member of the Student Non-Violent
Coordinating Committee, a leading civil rights group in the 1960s,
then helped lead the radical Black Panther Party.
</P>
<P>
   From there _ after serving six months in prison for illegal
possession of firearms _ he gravitated to electoral politics,
becoming a Democratic alderman in Chicago in the early 1980s. A
decade later, his radical in-your-face days behind him, he won a
seat in Congress, representing the 1st District on Chicago's
heavily black South Side.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 3 he was re-elected to a fourth term in the House with
86.4 percent of the vote. But it turns out that despite such
applause, he aspires to a different stage and role.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 23 he served notice that the job he really covets, and
intends to go after, is held by Mayor Richard M. Daley, a fellow
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   He has his work cut out.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, son of Richard J. Daley, one of the city's storied mayors
and political bosses, has twice won the job in a breeze, and
political pros say that with his father's natural political knack
and his voter-approval rating now hanging around 80 percent, he is
very likely to win a third term in next spring's election if, as is
expected, he runs again.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, 52, also faces another high political hurdle. Chicago is
only 40 percent black. So his best hope is that like the city's
first and only black mayor, Harold Washington, he can hammer
together a winning coalition of dissident black and white voters _
if the pieces still exist and if he can match Washington's delicate
consensus-building skills.
</P>
<P>
   He contends he can, saying Daley has pandered to the city's
wealthy and neglected its poor, has allowed its transportation and
school systems to deteriorate and has turned a blind eye to police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soul of Chicago,'' he said in his announcement, ``is the
hundreds of thousands of African-Americans, Latinos, Greeks, Poles,
Italians, Irish, Asians and other Chicagoans who live, work and pay
taxes in the city _ yet they are ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who already has a campaign war chest of almost $2
million, countered through an aide that if he ran, he would run on
a record that ``is one of accomplishment that reaches into all
corners of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressman also has a record that will be on display,''
the aide noted pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA: LEAVING WASHINGTON, WEIGHING COMEBACK?
</P>
<P>
   When Sen. Lauch Faircloth, R-N.C., ran for re-election this
year, he sometimes seemed to be running more against President
Clinton, labor unions and the Rev. Jesse Jackson than against his
Democratic opponent, John Edwards. He lost in one of the most
galling defeats of all for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as he prepares to leave Washington, Faircloth is focusing
on clearing up some $250,000 in unpaid campaign bills. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, his campaign manager, Chuck Fuller, sent out a
fund-raising letter in which he resumed the attack on Clinton,
unions and Jackson and said the senator ``desperately needs your
help to pay these bills as quickly as possible.'' Urging the
faithful to ``send a gift of $100, $250 or $500, or whatever you
can spare,'' Fuller said the senator had been done in by a
``left-wing establishment'' assault that was ``the most
comprehensive smear campaign that North Carolina has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot give up on our senator's conservative message of
bringing common sense to Washington,'' he said. ``We've come too
far together to turn back now. Another statewide race is just
around the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Is that a fund-raising gimmick? Or is the senator, who is 70 and
wealthy enough to retire his $250,000 campaign debt on his own,
thinking about running for governor in 2000, when that job will be
open? Or how about another try for the Senate in 2002, when a
fellow Republican, Jesse Helms, will be up for re-election?
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth offers no elaboration. And Fuller will say only that
``the senator's giving a lot of consideration to it.''
</P>
<P>
   To what?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's as far as I can take it for now,'' Fuller replied.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH: MORE TURBULENCE FOR STORMY CAMPAIGN
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before Election Day, when Rep. Merrill Cook, R-Utah,
figured he was right on the edge of losing his bid for a second
term, his party began a get-out-the-vote campaign that made no
mention of him but instead promoted the re-election of Sen. Robert
Bennett, who was in no political danger.
</P>
<P>
   Cook took offense and, as party officials tell it, stormed into
party headquarters, twice, shouting obscenities about the party in
general and Bennett in particular. The officials sent word that he
was no longer welcome at headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Cook went on to win re-election by more than 10 points, and
three days later, party officials say, apologized for his outburst.
His exile was lifted, tension subsided and the party basked in the
glow of an Election Day that saw a huge Republican sweep in Utah,
not the least of the victories being the surprisingly strong one by
Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Cook was tired and stressed,'' his spokeswoman,
Marianne Funk, later explained when asked about the shouting
incidents. ``Those few moments were an exception. He and party
leaders have mended fences and moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tension is back and the fences are in need of repair
again.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Cook's aides, including his chief of staff, Janet
Jenson, and his district director in Salt Lake, Robert Jeppsen,
have left his staff since Election Day, and it is not entirely
clear why.
</P>
<P>
   Jeppsen says he was let go after Cook angrily confronted him
with an article from The Salt Lake Tribune that the congressman
thought gave too much credit to his staff for his re-election
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials say Ms. Jenson was also dismissed, but she has
said very little about her departure. But, according to The
Tribune, she sent the Cook staff an e-mail message that said:
``Merrill has taken up permanent residence in wackoland and we are
all in serious jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook says that Jeppsen was ousted for poor performance in the
campaign and that Ms. Jenson resigned to seek a better job.
</P>
<P>
   Jeppsen's response to that, in an interview with The Tribune:
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy has a grenade in his mouth and he's going to pull the
pin.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook then had some words to say about The Tribune and John
Heilprin, a reporter who interviewed him. He said on a radio talk
show that Heilprin screamed at him in the phone interview and that
Heilprin ``was a little bit high on something, maybe beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Heilprin calls those accusations ``irresponsible'' and
``unfounded.'' The newspaper's editor, James Shelledy, defends
Heilprin's conduct as ``professional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These sort of wild accusations give credence to the most
recent indicators that Cook is having trouble grasping that he
won,'' Shelledy said in an article the paper published about the
talk show appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Funk, the congressman's spokeswoman, said of the appearance,
``He was not at his best.''

COMMENTARY: SEX AND SELF-PITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I go to work, and I feel trapped in Bill Clinton's
libido.
</P>
<P>
   I go to the movies, and I feel trapped in Woody Allen's libido.
</P>
<P>
   Neither place is a pretty place to be.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping that everyone would be too stupefied from overeating to
pay any attention, the president snuck out the answers to Henry
Hyde's 81 ``admit or deny'' questions on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   His answers about the Lewinsky affair were crisp, unambiguous
and revealing. He finally stepped up to the plate and accepted
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Nah. Just kidding.
</P>
<P>
   He is the weasel king. Those old Clintonian phrases flow
trippingly from the tongue: ``I do not recall ... I do not believe
... I may have talked about what to do in a nonlegal context at
some point in the past, but I have no specific memory of that
conversation ... I have no recollection ... I cannot be absolutely
sure ... I cannot respond to this inquiry because of the vagueness
of its terms (`indirect,' `potential,' `could be involved').''
Tactical brain death.
</P>
<P>
   The straightest question provokes a corkscrew response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you admit or deny that you are the chief law-enforcement
officer of the United States of America?''
</P>
<P>
   Response: ``The President is frequently referred to as the chief
law-enforcement officer, although nothing in the Constitution
specifically designates the President as such...''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde is looking for clarity in all the wrong places.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials are giggling that if the Republicans in
Congress vote for impeachment, it will be political suicide _
poison Kool-Aid time. ``Paula Jonestown,'' as one Clinton aide
sniggers.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to get caught up in the debate over how the president
should be punished. Why not a gantlet with Ping-Pong paddles? I
think that life and posterity will punish Clinton more severely
than Congress. Clio, the Muse of history, will remain immune to his
seductions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Rev. Starr has made himself happily available to the
celebrity culture. When Diane Sawyer asked him whether it would be
appropriate for him to be questioned about his own private life, I
was desperately hoping he would not take the bait. Instead, the
buttoned-down, pursed-lipped prosecutor volunteered that he had
never been unfaithful to his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen's new movie, ``Celebrity,'' begins with a scene that
many construed to be a homage to Monica and Bill. Melanie Griffith,
playing a movie star, offers to give a certain kind of sex to
Kenneth Branagh, a journalist writing a profile on her. ``What I do
from the neck up,'' she says, kneeling before him, is none of her
husband's business.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. The sex that isn't sex.
</P>
<P>
   It is utterly mystifying that respected actors _ and worse,
respected actresses _ are still so flattered to appear in Woody
Allen's nasty little indulgences of his own bile. A casting call
from Allen is just an invitation to degradation.
</P>
<P>
   I was not sure he could top the ugly scene in ``Deconstructing
Harry'' in which Julia Louis-Dreyfus wore little white socks and
had sex with her brother-in-law while her blind grandmother was
standing by.
</P>
<P>
   But I underestimated his talent. His new film is a veritable
anthology of erotic tackiness. He has a hooker, played by Bebe
Neuwirth, instruct Judy Davis in the proper technique of the sex
that isn't sex, using a banana as a teaching tool. He has an
Amazonian model, played by Charlize Theron, explain the
pan-orgasmic nature of her exquisitely sensitive body, while
Branagh, playing Allen, finds meaning in the universe in the sight
of her tight little dress. (Ms. Theron showed this clip to Jay
Leno, as she sat on the ``Tonight Show'' couch next to Jimmy
Carter.)
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, a million years ago, when Woody Allen's movies
had a heart. Now, they have only another organ. They still begin
with black-and-white titles against an accompaniment of old jazz _
this is supposed to prove their authenticity and their art _ and
then immediately go sour.
</P>
<P>
   This movie is itself a sex scandal, and as I watched it, I kept
being reminded of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clinton, the filmmaker is now most famous for a sex scandal
with a young woman. Like Clinton, Allen feels supremely sorry for
himself. Like Clinton, Allen just can't figure out how and why this
happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said, it isn't a pretty place.

COMMENTARY: A WHOLESALE SELLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stanley Hill cannot leave soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   Hill is the $300,000-a-year head of District Council 37, a
coalition of union locals representing 120,000 city workers.
Consider those workers unfortunate. Hill, dazzled by the friendly
treatment he received from one Rudolph Giuliani, stripped his
workers of their dignity and delivered them like beggars and
penitents to their boss, the very same Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   If you listen closely you can still hear the mayor laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stanley acted more like the mayor's agent than the workers'
representative,'' said Charles Ensley, president of a local that
represents 14,000 social workers.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to the contract negotiated nearly three years
ago in which Hill agreed with Giuliani that the district council's
workers could do without raises for a couple of years. He described
Hill during that period as ``busily ingratiating himself with the
mayor,'' and said, ``Stanley was more the obsequious, hat-in-hand
union leader than the aggressive advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the abysmal features of the contract was that it opened
the door to the widespread use of woefully underpaid welfare
recipients in municipal jobs traditionally held by union workers.
But Hill did not just sell his workers out by negotiating an
astonishingly lousy contract. He then closed his eyes and covered
his ears (at the very least) as corrupt union leaders rigged the
election in which the workers tried to vote down the contract.
</P>
<P>
   When the results came in just about everybody in District
Council 37 knew the election had been rigged, except Stanley Hill.
He says he knew nothing. Ensley and others, including James Butler,
president of the hospital workers' local, were running around the
city telling anyone who would listen that the election had been
hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just crystal clear what had happened with that vote,''
said a local official who was interviewed Friday and asked not to
be identified. ``It was so apparent. Any thinking person would have
known that that was not an honest count.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who refused to credit any talk of a stolen election
were Stanley Hill and Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani once made a
reputation chasing the kinds of crooks and scoundrels that control
District Council 37. Now he eagerly climbs into bed with them. The
contract ratified by the fraudulent vote set the pattern for
agreements with other municipal unions and helped Giuliani balance
the city's budget. And District Council 37 endorsed Giuliani for
re-election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the fraudulent election is just part of an
extensive pattern of corruption in District Council 37. Joseph
DeCanio, the president of a local representing highway laborers,
pleaded guilty this month to stealing more than $50,000 in a
kickback scheme connected to the donation of Thanksgiving turkeys
to union members.
</P>
<P>
   In reporting on the guilty plea, The New York Times' Steven
Greenhouse cited sources who said Manhattan District Attorney
Robert Morgenthau is also investigating allegations of kickbacks
from caterers, law firms and travel agencies, and charges that
officials flew their girlfriends and other nonunion members to
labor conventions at union expense.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, of course, knew nothing of these activities. Last Monday
he announced that his two top aides and closest personal friends _
Martin Lubin and Mark Shaplo _ were resigning because they admitted
knowing about the vote fraud. But they scrupulously kept that
knowledge to themselves, according to Hill.
</P>
<P>
   You might wonder how a labor leader could continue to get more
than $300,000 annually in salary and perks while being so out of
touch with the real world that he fails to get even minimal raises
for his struggling workers for a couple of years, is completely
unaware of a fraudulent election that his closest advisers knew
about, and has absolutely no knowledge of other instances of
corruption that are threatening to wreck his union.
</P>
<P>
   Ignorance doesn't get more blissful than that.
</P>
<P>
   Now the district attorney is all over the union. Indictments are
anticipated, and the embarrassed parent of District Council 37, the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, is
considering placing the council into trusteeship.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hill's days are numbered. For city workers, the lower
the number the better.

ASSASSINATION BLUNTS ST. PETERSBURG'S HOPES FOR DEMOCRACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ In this century, this city has made
more than its share of history and seen more than its share of
blood. It was here in 1917 that the Romanov dynasty fell and the
Bolshevik revolution began. The murder here in 1934 of a local
Communist commissar unleashed Stalin's campaign of terror, which
sent millions to camps in Siberia and to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   And so for many Russians, there was an eerie echo to the shots
fired in a stairwell off the ice-bound Griboyedova Canal, killing
Galina Starovoitova, a 52-year-old Russian legislator known for her
fierce defense of democracy and her down-to-earth common sense.
</P>
<P>
   In this hauntingly beautiful city, her death marked the end of
an illusion that began in the 1980s with the democratic movement
that she helped found and that has struggled to survive ever since,
with the crime, corruption and economic disarray that followed the
collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you expect in Russia,'' asked Vladimir, a 47-year-old
retired air force pilot who declined to give his last name, heading
home in winter's early darkness. ``This country is not ready for
democracy in terms of both its historical legacy and the mentality
of its people. Some mistakenly thought _ `poof' _ they could make
this country democratic in a week. But it doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   It is enough to tick off a list of the movement's leaders, and
note where they are now. Andrei Sakharov, the great human rights
campaigner, and now Mrs. Starovoitova, his close ally, are dead.
President Boris Yeltsin, who a decade ago was barnstorming the
country with a campaign to set Russia free from communism, is now a
chronic invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Sobchak, one of the leading orators of the democratic
movement and St. Petersburg's first elected mayor, was voted out of
office in 1996 and, facing charges of corruption, slipped away to a
life of self-imposed exile in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Chubais, an economic reformer who left Russia's old
czarist capital to run post-Communist privatization, is now a
politically discredited figure, blamed for improving the lives of a
wealthy few at the expense of the numerous poor.
</P>
<P>
   In this city of 5 million, which dropped the name Leningrad and
reverted to its imperial name after communism fell, ``democrat'' is
still not quite the dirty word it has become elsewhere. Liberal
parties _ whether Mrs. Starovoitova's Democratic Russia, or Grigory
Yavlinsky's Yabloko _ continue to hold their own, even after ceding
the local governorship to an old-style apparatchik in 1996. The
Communist Party has never placed better than fourth in either local
or national elections here.
</P>
<P>
   But few deny that the democrats, even when they had power, did
little to improve the life of the city that Peter the Great decreed
into existence, its splendor rising on marshes that bury thousands
of slaves who died building it.
</P>
<P>
   Modern St. Petersburg is still dominated by an ailing defense
industry. While its service sector has surged ahead, its downtown
has little of Moscow's luster and none of its frantic bustle. A few
historical buildings are under restoration, but for the most part
St. Petersburg's pastel palaces now, as before, could use a coat of
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Most disturbing of all, murders here have become commonplace,
Mrs. Starovoitova's being only the latest and the most shocking.
Last year, a top city official was killed by a sniper as he drove
down Nevsky Prospekt, the main street. An aide to the speaker of
the Russian Parliament, a local Communist deputy, was wounded this
fall. Other victims of gangland-style killings and beatings have
included businessmen, managers of the city's port, bankers and an
investigative journalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder has become a way of solving problems,'' said Sergei
Kozyrev, a physicist and close ally of Mrs. Starovoitova, echoing
Stalin's famous phrase: ``Where there is a man, there's a problem.
No man, no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Such lawlessness is not uncommon in the rest of the country, but
in this graceful city, which prides itself on preserving Russia's
cultural heritage and the purity of its pre-Communist language, the
new reputation as a capital of crime sits hard.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Likhachev, at 91, is Russia's most venerated man of
letters, a St. Petersburg-based scholar whose wisdom is often
sought in times of trouble. He looks at the latest murder as an
example of a moral collapse that occurred during decades of
Communist rule, but was revealed in full only when that control was
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   What shocks him most, he said in an interview, is the modern
Russian use of the English word ``killer'' to describe a profession
like any other.
</P>
<P>
   As a young man he spent three and a half years in a Soviet labor
camp, and he remembers how ordinary thieves would refuse to
associate with killers, whom they believed to be the lowest of the
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now `killer' has become a neutral word,'' he said. ``Those who
kill consider it a complex and dangerous specialty. That is how far
our morality has sunk.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Communist system ended, Likhachev said, he thought
Russians would rediscover their moral compass. ``I thought people
had stayed the same,'' he said. ``But it turned out they were
completely different.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many democrats agree that they underestimated the legacy of 70
years of totalitarian rule, which taught people to sacrifice
individual responsibility at the altar of an autocratic state, to
view materialism as the driving force of history and the law as a
tool of dictators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't evaluate the depths of people's psychology,'' said
Kozyrev, who has grown weary of getting even scientists to agree on
common goals. ``If people are used to one form of behavior, a form
of vertical authority, then when someone suddenly comes along and
changes the signals, replaces one idea with another, they can't
just adapt overnight. It is not easy to turn a boat around. And
this is a big boat, and the inertia runs deep.''
</P>
<P>
   Even democrats are hard-pressed to defend their record here,
although most blame their failures on Sobchak. At best he was a
sloppy and arrogant administrator, and at worst an unabashed
opportunist who kept city-owned apartments for himself and his
friends, and who preferred wining and dining wary Western investors
to doing the city's business. One of his dreams was to turn
Russia's northern capital, as St. Petersburg is often called, into
a financial center. It did not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought it was enough to go to the West, and ask for money,
which would then come in by the riverful,'' said Igor Artemyev, a
deputy governor and member of the Yabloko party. ``But then when
the Western investors came, they saw that the city was not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The new administration boasts of having put the city's fiscal
affairs in order, restructured its debt, increased tax collections
and cut its deficit. But these efforts have been blotted both by
the increasingly brazen criminals and by the economic slump that
hit Russia this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a previously unpublished interview that ran last week in the
newspaper Argumenti i Fakti, Mrs. Starovoitova said the term
``democrat'' in Russia had lost its value because some had been too
quick to sacrifice their ideals for political expediency.
</P>
<P>
   As she put it: ``The pain, the disappointment, the nostalgia for
those times brightened by the name of Sakharov and by all the hopes
we connected with democracy _ I think these feelings are due to a
combination of objective factors that slowed real reforms, and
subjective mistakes made by particular people who held the great
share of power.'' The last phrase was an obvious allusion to
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   To Likhachev, sitting in his office in a Russian cultural center
with a line of young graduate students waiting outside his door,
the democrats' record is not a total loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected more from the democrats,'' he said, ``but most
important, they have not given up on freedom of speech, freedom of
the press, all those freedoms that are now under attack. In the
schools today, there are some wonderful young people. Maybe we have
to wait for the generation that grew up under Stalin, under
Khrushchev, to die. But the most important task is to keep the
records, the documents and archives so that people know the
truth.''

U.S. BOLSTERS HOUSING AID FOR THE ELDERLY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Thanksgiving weekend as a backdrop, President
Clinton highlighted two new housing programs Saturday that would
provide $822 million for low-income people who are elderly or
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said that the money would
benefit 29,400 people living in 48 states, and the District of
Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico. Montana and North Dakota, sparsely
populated states, are the only two that are not slated to receive
any of the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``For millions of struggling senior citizens and people with
disabilities, the peace and security of a decent home is a distant
dream and the threat of homelessness an ever-present nightmare,''
Clinton said, discussing the programs, which are included in the
new budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
``Too many of these hard-pressed Americans are warehoused in
sterile nursing homes _ not because they need to be, but because
they can't afford to live anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Americans should never have to choose between
putting a meal on the table or putting a roof over their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration's $25 billion housing budget for the 1999
fiscal year was one of the few appropriation requests that met with
little opposition in the Republican-led Congress this year. It
included $1.8 billion in new spending for vouchers, which reflected
the first major increase in housing spending in four years and also
the department's efforts to rid itself of wasteful programs and
mismanagement that characterized it in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The larger of the programs Clinton cited in his radio address
generates $696 million in grants to nonprofit organizations around
the country to build and rehabilitate 8,200 apartment units for
older people and the disabled who fall below certain income levels.
</P>
<P>
   The second program will provide an additional $126.8 million to
be distributed among disabled people in the form of rent subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials predict that the new apartments will
accommodate 12,400 people through projects managed by 166 private
groups that competed for the grants. The money will cover
development costs and does not have to be repaid so long as the new
housing is available for 40 years to low-income elderly residents
or people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   More money is available to the project owner to cover
differences between the rent and operating costs.
</P>
<P>
   Those receiving the assistance must be classified as ``very low
income,'' which means that a household cannot earn more than 50
percent of the area's median income. On a national average,
administration officials say that amounts to less than $8,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The second program is expected to provide affordable housing for
more than 17,000 low-income people with disabilities so that their
rent does not exceed 30 percent of their income.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a priority for the president,'' Andrew
Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all getting older, not only individually, but as a
society, and the numbers are alarming,'' Cuomo said. ``The graying
of America is going to have significant impact on the nation's
housing and will be one of the greatest challenges we face over the
next 10 years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The country now has about 34 million citizens 65 or older,
compared with about 3 million at the turn of the 20th century.
Cuomo said that the figure was expected to reach 53 million within
25 years, putting additional strain on the need for affordable
units.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cuomo said, the department and the private
organizations that are building new units are redesigning them with
older and disabled people in mind, focusing on communal facilities
for health and recreation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that despite the benefits most Americans are
accruing through the prosperous economy, too many elderly and
disabled people ``are trapped in substandard housing, where broken
plumbing, inadequate heat and hazardous hallways are a dangerous
fact of life. And too many spend more than half of their modest
incomes on housing, often sacrificing basic needs like food and
medical care just to pay the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting the administration's efforts, he added, ``At this
moment of unparalleled prosperity, we must not do less.''

NATIONS AGREE TO CEASE-FIRE FOR CONGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Leaders of Congo and neighboring countries giving
support to armed rebels in the central African country agreed
Saturday under U.N. auspices to sign a cease-fire agreement by
mid-December, said President Jacques Chirac of France.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac said that U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan had secured
promises to end the fighting in meetings with eight African leaders
held Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   With Annan by his side as the summit ended in the Louvre Museum,
Chirac said, ``The hope is that the signing of a cease-fire should
take place before the meeting of the Organization of African Unity
in Ouagadougou on Dec. 17 and 18.'' Ouagadougou is the capital of
Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac took care not to say that the fighting was over, and did
not say whether the rebels, whom he had not invited to the meeting,
had been consulted. ``Everybody has moved a bit and all we can do
now is support the efforts by the secretary general and the
Organization of African Unity to end this situation, which is as
absurd as it is lethal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan met with Congo President Laurent Kabila and leaders of
neighboring states, including Angola, Zimbabwe, Uganda and Rwanda.
Chirac described the meetings as ``tense but not hostile.''
</P>
<P>
   Angola and Zimbabwe have been backing Congo's leader, whose
forces last year drove out a regime long backed by France that was
headed by Mobutu Sese Seko. The country was then known as Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda and Rwanda, which helped Kabila win power in 1997,
quarreled with him and are now backing rebels fighting his regime
in eastern Congo. French television showed Kabila glowering at
Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni and at Rwanda's leader, Pasteur
Bizimungu, as Annan talked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have committed themselves to accepting a cease-fire, and
they also decided to accept an immediate end of hostilities,''
Annan said later.
</P>
<P>
   Given Kabila's spotty record on putting his signature to
agreements reached verbally, it was difficult to say what would
actually happen on the ground in Africa. ``What accord? I have not
signed any accord,'' Kabila said after the announcement by Chirac,
who received him in his office in Elysee Palace later. ``I think
there is no reason to doubt his word,'' Chirac said before the
meeting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A year ago, Kabila wriggled out of an agreement that Bill
Richardson, then the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations,
said he had negotiated to permit an international investigation
into the massacre of tens of thousands of ethnic Hutu refugees
during Kabila's victory sweep across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about signing a cease-fire in mid-December, Kabila said
Saturday: ``It's possible, but we have to prepare an accord. We
will find a solution, we will do everything possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bizimungu of Rwanda said, ``I do not think we have advanced.''
But, he added, ``It was not useless, it's better than a breakup.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion is rooted in the ethnic conflicts between the Hutu
and Tutsi populations in central Africa that led to the massacre of
half-a-million people in Rwanda in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu organizers of the killings fled into refugee camps in
Congo and used the camps as bases for attacks on Rwanda. To fight
back, the Tutsi-led government in Rwanda supported Kabila's
uprising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But tens of thousands of Hutu refugees _ 180,000 people,
according to the United Nations _ disappeared as they were driven
across Congo by Kabila's advancing army in 1996 and 1997, prompting
French human rights groups to press Paris prosecutors
unsuccessfully to bring criminal charges against him while he was
here. The Paris prosecutor's office declined Friday to take action,
saying Kabila had immunity as head of state.
</P>
<P>
   France, which had regarded Kabila's takeover of Congo last year
as a U.S.-backed plot to reduce French influence in its former
African colonies, improved relations with him this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, the United States, which had given up on Congo's
former dictator, Mobutu, long before France did, now has lost its
earlier ardor for Kabila and, diplomats say, is doing what it can
to cooperate with the French to help end the fighting in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The French summary of the summit proceedings here reported:
``The presidents of the Republic of Uganda and of Rwanda reaffirmed
their readiness for a cease-fire that the presidents and heads of
delegation of Namibia, Zimbabwe, Angola and Chad also said they
wanted as soon as conditions permit.''

SPANISH JUDGE INVESTIGATING ABUSES IN ARGENTINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the former
Chilean dictator, is only one of several former South American
strongmen being investigated by a Spanish judge for possible
extradition to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Another is a retired Argentine admiral, Emilio Massera, who was
the chief ideologue of the military junta that took power in 1976
and also supervisor of the most notorious secret detention center
in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Argentine judicial authorities placed Massera, 73, under arrest
this week after he refused to testify about the abduction of
children of people who disappeared during the military's campaign
against leftists.
</P>
<P>
   Massera was taken into custody Tuesday in a case that has
already led to the detention in June of a former general, Jorge
Rafael Videla, who led the first of three military juntas that
ruled Argentina between 1976 and 1983. The admiral previously
served five years of a life sentence for his involvement in several
kidnappings, tortures and disappearances, until he was pardoned by
President Carlos Saul Menem in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   But Menem's pardon of military officers involved in the ``dirty
war'' did not cover the kidnapping of scores of babies by the
military after they were born in prison camps. The children were
taken away from their mothers at birth and then adopted by
childless military families.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the mothers typically were dumped alive from navy
aircraft into the ocean, incinerated, or shot and buried in secret
graves, according to the testimony of former military officers.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Massera involves two children born in 1976 in
the Navy Mechanics School in Buenos Aires, which he supervised as
naval commander. One of the children, Javier Vildoza, now 20, was
raised by one of Massera's chief personal assistants, who is now a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Vildoza's mother, Cecilia Vinas, was seized by Argentine
security forces in 1978 while she was eight months pregnant, and
was never seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Before his arrest, Massera denied any knowledge of the
kidnapping of the newborn babies.
</P>
<P>
   Baltazar Garzon, the Spanish judge whose warrant led to the
arrest of Pinochet in London six weeks ago, is also investigating
Massera's links to a Chilean military operation that sought the
capture of Chilean exiles in Argentina and several other countries
and their return to Chile for execution.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon's investigation is also looking into the participation of
the militaries of Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia in the
Chilean-led program known as Operation Condor. His inquiry has
encouraged Bolivia's opposition to demand that Bolivian
law-enforcement authorities investigate the involvement of
President Hugo Banzer, who was military dictator of the country
between 1971 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Banzer has denied any knowledge of Operation Condor, although he
reportedly met personally with Chilean military authorities to
discuss intelligence matters. Argentine news organizations have
reported that Gen. Domingo Bussi, a retired officer who is
currently governor of Tucuman province, could also be implicated in
the Garzon investigation. He has also denied involvement in
Operation Condor.
</P>
<P>
   Menem has strongly backed the Chilean government's position that
former South American military leaders should be tried in their own
countries as a matter of sovereignty. And he has pledged to resist
any efforts to try Argentine military officers abroad.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Menem declared an amnesty for Massera and other officers
eight years ago, he was trying to put an end to periodic military
revolts. Since then he has cut the military budget, and the armed
forces now play a much reduced role in Argentine affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Menem has repeatedly said he will not interfere in the judicial
investigation of the military kidnappings. After Massera's arrest,
he said, ``This is a matter solely for the judiciary to decide. The
government naturally accepts the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony at the Santa Cruz naval base on Wednesday, he did
not refer directly to the case, but he said: ``There is no longer
any possibility that we will be divided. We have suffered the
consequences of confrontation and I don't want our country ever to
return to those days.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest Massera had been held in the Campo de Mayo
military barracks, which also served as a detention center during
the so-called Dirty War. But after he suffered a heart murmur
Thursday, a judge on Saturday allowed him to be transferred out of
the facility to remain under house arrest. Videla is also awaiting
trial under house arrest.

A POINT MAN UNDER FIRE: HAROLD ICKES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his three years serving President Clinton as
staff trouble shooter and campaign financing strategist, Harold
Ickes became enough of a lightning rod that he had to undergo 26
separate sessions of questioning under oath by investigators of the
Republican-controlled Congress and Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   A scathingly wry and combative partisan strategist, Ickes always
claimed to take it in stride as a part of the ``gotcha''
investigatory culture of modern Washington politics. ``What they're
trying to do is catch you in a perjury charge,'' he said three
years ago after the first dozen of his sessions with investigators.
``And then they try to squeeze you.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, having weathered thousands of questions and amassed
hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal bills, Ickes, the former
White House deputy chief of staff, finds fate and fortune hinging
on one single, brief response he offered to a question in one of
his 26 bouts of testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did the administration do regarding the Diamond Walnut
strike?'' he was asked on Sept. 22, 1997, on the third day of
private deposition that preceded another Ickes session of public
testimony before the Senate governmental Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing that I know of,'' Ickes responded about a long-running
Teamsters strike at Diamond Walnut Growers, a California
agricultural cooperative. His questioners thereupon moved to other
topics.
</P>
<P>
   With that scrap of colloquy, the stage has been set Monday for a
decision by Attorney General Janet Reno on whether to accede to the
demands of administration critics and the recommendations of some
of her own advisers and seek the appointment of an independent
counsel _ the eighth in the life of the Clinton administration _ to
look into whether Ickes committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, Reno rejected a separate independent counsel
recommendation in the case of Vice President Al Gore's 1996
fund-raising activities. She has another recommendation pending for
a broad independent counsel inquiry into whether Clinton violated
the law in spending re-election money.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern in some Democratic circles that while Reno most
likely will spare the president another independent counsel
vetting, this might leave Ickes more vulnerable in a relentlessly
political year for targeting as ``the administration scapegoat,''
in the words of one of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   In October, a House panel investigating the Teamsters union
sought to build the case against Ickes by disclosing White House
documents detailing his efforts to resolve the Diamond dispute in
1995, when the re-election campaign was warming up and Ickes was
intent on enlisting the support of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters and other major unions. After meeting with Teamsters
officials, Ickes reached out to Mickey Kantor, then the U.S. trade
representative, to persuade him to intervene in behalf of the
striking Teamsters, the documents disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Kantor told Congress that he eventually telephoned Diamond
Walnut but for nothing more than a ``benign'' status inquiry about
the prospects for a settlement. There was no pressure applied for a
settlement, Kantor testified. An official of the company, whose
potential business includes export markets, testified that ``there
was absolutely no explicit threat,'' but that the phone call was
received as a significant part of the Teamster effort ``to bring us
to our knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Peter Hoekstra, R-Mich., who has been investigating the
Teamsters, contends that Ickes deserves prosecution for perjury.
The lawmaker says that Ickes perpetrated what the Justice
Department terms ``The I Don't Remember Syndrome'' of misleading
questioners by not disclosing all he might have recalled in
response to the question of ``what did the administration do
regarding'' the strike.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Ickes' lawyers insist his answer was more than
defensible considering how isolated and ambiguous the question was.
They argue that Clinton administration officials only made
inquiries and did not take concrete action _ did not ``do''
anything _ to press for an ending to the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, lawyers for Ickes note that the issue was never
followed up by additional questions in the deposition, nor in the
public testimony that followed, despite legal precedents in perjury
cases emphasizing the need for adequate follow-up to
``fundamentally ambiguous'' questions. One Ickes brief cites a
Supreme Court ruling that ``the burden is on the questioner to pin
the witness down to the specific object of the questioner's
inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bennett, Ickes' lawyer, said: ``We hope there'll be no
referral by the attorney general. It would be a terrible injustice
in light of the facts and under the law to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The typically hard-nosed Ickes has described campaign financing
by both parties as a shocking, ``demeaning,'' but technically legal
scandal. The law merits reform, he says, yet is unlikely to be
changed unless an illegal scandal on the order of Watergate arouses
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what the law allowed,'' he told earlier investigators
last year.
</P>
<P>
   As he awaits the attorney general's decision, Ickes, now a
59-year-old lawyer and business consultant, has declined all news
interviews. Three years ago, he described himself as ``seared'' by
all his subpoenaed appearances, but certainly braced for more.

HOCKEY COLUMN: KOVALEV, RANGERS TUNE IN TO FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JOE LaPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ These scenes are common in the corridors of the
National Hockey League arenas, the players from the opposing teams
chatting briefly after games before going their separate ways. But
this moment was a little special in its freshness as these old
companions paused at the fork in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Leetch and Mike Richter, senior members of the New York
Rangers, were smiling and shaking hands with Aleksei Kovalev
backstage Friday night at the Civic Arena. He played with them for
more than six seasons, before Wednesday's big trade. Now, he was a
member of the Pittsburgh Penguins, headed to Montreal and a date
Saturday night with the Canadiens while they went back to New York
for a game against Nashville on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a cheater,'' Richter said, joking about Kovalev.
</P>
<P>
   After his old friends had left, Kovalev reflected on how hockey
players move from team to team and sometimes reunite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday, I might come back to New York,'' Kovalev said. ``For
now, I'll enjoy it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, he must have enjoyed it Friday night. Playing with a
variety of linemates, Kovalev assisted on both Penguin goals in a
2-2 tie with the Rangers in the first game of the rest of his
career. The second came with 15 seconds left in regulation time
when his stickhandling and passing helped Robert Lang beat Richter.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalev and Petr Nedved were the principals in a multiplayer
deal that might help both teams. The Rangers got a proven center
with a good shot and setup skills, filling one of their essential
needs. The Penguins got the most talented man, an enigmatic right
wing whose unrealized potential is as enormous and as untapped as
any in the business, a first-round draft choice from 1991 who was
sometimes good but rarely great. Richter, speaking seriously,
noted: ``You have to give up good things to get good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, away from New York and its peculiar pressures, Kovalev will
not command such a bright spotlight. He will be the understudy to
Jaromir Jagr, another right wing and the captain of the team, who
thinks Kovalev might benefit from the change in address.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put too much pressure on him, that's for sure,'' Jagr
said. ``I think it's going to be a lot easier in Pittsburgh for
him. He's probably one of the five most talented guys I've ever
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The new surrounding cast also may help Kovalev. In his best
season, when he helped the Rangers to the 1994 Stanley Cup at the
age of 21, Kovalev was one of four Russian Rangers. Gradually, the
other three were sent away.
</P>
<P>
   Even around teammates genuinely fond of him, Kovalev seemed
alone if not aloof. With Pittsburgh, his teammates include four
other Russians, five players from the Czech Republic, one from
Latvia and one from Lithuania. Most speak a common language and
play a common style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jagr is from Czech and some of the Czechs speak Russian,''
Kovalev said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a credit to Pittsburgh general manager Craig Patrick and
to his New York counterpart, Neil Smith, that they were willing to
deal with Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference rivals. Now,
with 11 NHL defensemen both in New York and with his Hartford farm
team, Smith has pieces to move in his next deal, the one for the
sharpshooter to play alongside either Nedved or Wayne Gretzky. As
they begin the second quarter of the season, the Rangers are near
the bottom of the division, the conference and the entire league,
but they are a work in progress, one worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   Despite losing the victory, they got a tie, finishing a
five-game road trip at 1-2-2. They have lost but five of their last
17.
</P>
<P>
   At least their disappointing finish Friday night could be seen
in the New York area on cable television. Consider the status of
their cross-river rivals, the Devils, who lead the division and the
conference and are near the top of the league.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Devils went into Dallas and fashioned an
impressive victory over a Stanley Cup contender. But nobody could
view it locally because their television rights are held by
Cablevision, which owns the Rangers and owns the rights to all
three local hockey teams, both baseball teams and both basketball
teams. Cablevision refuses to allow more than two games to air in
the market, and the Islanders got the nod instead on Wednesday.
Back when there was competition between Cablevision and the MSG
network, when they were independent of each other, the viewers had
more choices.
</P>
<P>
   As long as he is getting his Cablevision money, the Devils'
owner, John McMullen, does not publicly protest as his team's fans
are being short-changed by the company that owns Madison Square
Garden and his team's biggest rival.
</P>
<P>
   If he will not act on behalf of the hockey consumer, perhaps the
NHL should take action before the antitrust odor attracts attention
from public authorities outside the hockey business.
</P>
<P>
   A dog-in-the-manger business plan that favors the Rangers and
underexposes a top rival in a huge market sets a poisonous
precedent that is penny-wise for Cablevision and pound-foolish for
hockey.

HAIR BRAIDERS SUE OVER LICENSING REQUIREMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas, Md., Mich.)  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio _ Faith Carey-Proctor's dream of expanding her
hair-braiding business is on hold. More precisely, it is stacked
against the inside wall of a building she rents downtown, where
there are dog-eared cardboard boxes of lotions and sprays, desk
drawers full of combs, and a shopping cart loaded with rollers and
hair extensions, an occasional curl twined through the bars.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carey-Proctor is one of four African-American hair braiders
who have sued the Ohio Board of Cosmetology for what they say are
unfair and burdensome licensing requirements.
</P>
<P>
   If the lawsuit, which seeks to change the regulations, is
successful, Ms. Carey-Proctor plans to remodel and expand the
business Faithfully Yours, which she and her sister started two
years ago. Otherwise, she says she will go back to braiding at
home, which she has been doing, without a license, for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Ms. Carey-Proctor said she was not worried about
losing clients. ``Hair means a lot to a woman,'' she said. ``We
have some clients who are balding, but we can build them a head of
hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have to go underground with us, they will,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In taking their case to court, Ms. Carey-Proctor, her sister
Cassandra Taylor, and Cheryll Hosey and Michael Martin from the
It's My Business Hair Braiding Gallery in Youngstown are not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Hair braiders in other states also have protested against
cosmetology licenses requiring experience in perming, tinting and
cutting, which the braiders never use, and offering little or no
training in a form of hair styling that has been handed down
through generations of black families _ twisting, braiding and
weaving in extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Similar lawsuits have been filed in New York, California and
Texas, and braiders have won exemption from some regulations in
Washington, D.C., Maryland and Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio hair braiders must now obtain a cosmetology license to
operate. This requires 1,500 hours of training _ considerably more
than the 446 hours needed to become a police officer _ and the
training costs thousands of dollars, takes nearly a year and uses
chemicals and thermal processing, the staples of mainstream
cosmetology.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetology board twice told Ms. Carey-Proctor to close her
business and then threatened to charge her with a fourth-degree
misdemeanor for operating a business without a license. Ms.
Carey-Proctor sought the help of the Institute for Justice, a
nonprofit public-interest organization based in Washington, which
takes on ``economic liberty'' cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a classic example of the government interfering with
people's right to earn a living,'' said Dana Berliner, a lawyer
with the institute, which filed the braiders' lawsuit last year.
``Braiding is something my clients love to do, and it gives them a
chance to be entrepreneurs. They could go to nursing school and
learn as much about braiding as they would in cosmetology school.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dave Williamson, the executive director of the cosmetology
board, said the training ensures that braiders learn about health
and safety precautions, like recognizing certain skin conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was also concerned about the livelihoods of licensed
black cosmetologists, who sometimes do braiding. ``They worked hard
to build their businesses in these communities,'' Williamson said.
``It creates a problem when there are some folks providing these
services who are licensed and others who are not.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Recently, the braiders and their lawyers testified in support of
a bill introduced by state Rep. Vermel Whalen, D-Cleveland, that
would make it easier for braiders to receive licenses. Ms. Whalen,
who began working on the bill five years ago, said she was
concerned that cosmetology licensing regulations might keep women
without education or resources from earning a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``With welfare reform on our plates, I saw this as an
economic-development piece,'' Ms. Whalen said. ``I definitely
thought we should stop the hair police from making criminals out of
law-abiding citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ms. Carey-Proctor was chagrined to find herself accused
of breaking the law. She said that a neighborhood drug dealer
taunted her after her legal troubles began. ``I always told him
he'd wind up going to jail some day,'' she said. ``After all this
happened, he came in and told me that it looked like I might be
going to jail, too.''

 &HT;    Atlanta taking lesson in noneducator-led school systems
 &HT;    By Rochelle Carter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jean Dodd says hiring a superintendent who is not an
educator is like going to a nurse instead of a specialist for
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt seriously if Wachovia were looking for a president
they would come looking for an educator,'' the Atlanta school board
member says.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Atlanta school board is open to the
possibility of hiring a noneducator to lead the school system,
someone who did not come through the traditional ranks of
administration in K-12 public schools.
</P>
<P>
   That evolution in thinking, while in its infancy in Georgia,
mirrors a national trend.
</P>
<P>
   Several large urban school districts have turned to military
people, college presidents, attorneys, and government officials as
they look for leaders to fix their ills. Among them are Chicago,
Seattle, Washington D.C., San Diego, Milwaukee and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are more open to it it now than they ever have been,''
said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Washington
D.C-based Council of the Great City Schools.
</P>
<P>
   Casserly says that's a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Going outside education circles ``stretches you to thinking
about what it is you want in a leader,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nontraditional superintendents have had mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago school superintendent Paul Vallas, who is the city's
former budget director, has been embraced by the city, including
the powerful Chicago Teacher's Union.
</P>
<P>
   But Julius Becton, a war veteran and retired Army lieutenant
general, quit the Washington D.C. school system in April after 17
months on the job.
</P>
<P>
   Both men say their lack of a traditional superintendent's
experience track record has not contributed to their successes or
failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need a K-12 background to run something,'' said
Becton, who headed the Federal Emergency Management Agency and
Prairie View A&AMP;M University before leading the D.C. schools. Becton
said he quit because the system's financial control board insulted
him by questioning his integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need is a proven manager, which is why you are seeing
more and more cities doing what Atlanta is doing,'' Becton said.
``I had a requested budget of $525 million. Not many high school
principals have that kind of budget or experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallas was appointed CEO of Chicago schools 3 1/2 years ago when
Mayor Richard Daley Jr. took over control of the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Before that he was the city's budget director; served as revenue
analyst for the Illinois Senate President's office; was a
university public finance instructor; and taught elementary school.
He also was a captain and senior instructor in the Illinois Army
National Guard.
</P>
<P>
   That varied background, plus support from Daley, he said, have
contributed to his success. In his first seven months, he and his
leadership team secured $800 million in loans to build 13 new
schools and 40 annexes, and balanced the $3 billion budget. Also,
test scores have risen during his tenure, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think they'll just bring in a CEO to solve their
problems. That's not necessarily going to solve your problems,''
Vallas said.
</P>
<P>
   What has worked for him, he said, is these ingredients: ``You
understand the educational issues. You know the political terrain.
You know what constitutes a good policy and can figure out how to
pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline Gallagher, spokeswoman for the Chicago Teacher's
Union, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me ... you don't need someone with three doctorate
degrees who is going to come in and be profoundly educational,''
Gallagher said. ``The superintendent needs to be someone who can
run the show. That's what Vallas has.''
</P>
<P>
   But Becton got off to a rough start. He angered many parents
when he closed 13 schools, five fewer than he wanted to close. He
replaced dozens of leaky roofs, but the repairs resulted in schools
opening three weeks behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When he quit, he was replaced by his deputy superintendent, an
educator.
</P>
<P>
   Delabian Rice-Thurston, executive director of Parents United for
the D.C. Public Schools, said Becton's problem wasn't his lack of
experience in public school systems.
</P>
<P>
   Becton's downfall resulted from several issues, Rice-Thurston
said, ranging from his refusal to listen to parents to having no
support from Congress, which appointed Becton to run D.C. schools
after taking control of it from Mayor Marion Berry and the elected
school board. ``If you have a person who can ask the right
questions and get counsel when he needs it on matters of education,
you are all right,'' Rice-Thurston said. ``The person you put in
charge has got to be willing to find high quality people who know
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Fulton County Manager John Stanford left Atlanta to run
the 47,000-student Seattle school system in September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his first year, test scores were up across all
grade levels. Stanford required principals to undergo a yearlong
training program. He led local school districts in a bid to receive
more funding from the state legislature, and he was largely
responsible for securing the $2.2 million raised by a private
foundation that supports the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Some teachers felt Stanford placed too much emphasis on test
scores, which left many of them feeling they needed to ``teach to
the test'' to raise scores, according to an article in the Seattle
Times.
</P>
<P>
   But Barbara Schaad-Lamphere, president of the Seattle Board of
Education, is a huge fan of Stanford's.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job and John Stanford is a match made in heaven,'' she
said recently. ``We needed a guy to really spark us into new
thinking, new believing, a new level of performance. Actually, what
we got was more like a blowtorch. It's been an unbelievable
privilege to work with him.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of private individuals offered Stanford a $500,000
performance bonus to stay in Seattle through 2001-2002. He
declined.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's turnaround of the schools has turned into a fight for
his life. In March, he was diagnosed with leukemia and an acting
superintendent _ who also has a nontraditional background _ has
taken his place. Stanford is on medical leave from the system.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Georgia's only example of a nontraditional
superintendent is David Crews, who served for a few months in
Gwinnett County, acccording to Bill Barr, head of the Georgia
School Superintendents Association. Crews was Gwinnett's associate
superintendent overseeing school finance when he was appointed
interim superintendent in late 1994 after Superintendent George
Thompson resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's superintendent search committee and school board
members agree they want an innovative leader like Vallas or
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am willing to consider any individual that I think can help
Atlanta Public Schools meet the challenges that we face,'' Atlanta
school board member Mike Holiman said. ``I guess that means I'm
open to a noneducator.''
</P>
<P>
   But board member Dodd isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Educators ``are getting so much negative press from people,''
said Dodd, a retired Atlanta school teacher and member of the
superintendent search committee. ``If we as educators can't do it,
then how can (noneducators) do it?'' The search committee, which
includes some of the city's heavy-hitters in the business
community, meets Dec. 3. to consider the top candidates drawn up by
executive search firm LAI Ward Howell. The new superintendent will
replace Benjamin O. Canada, who left Atlanta in July to become
superintendent of the Portland, Ore., school district. The search
firm's Charles Taylor has looked for people who work with large
budgets, have overseen large organizations, and have a demonstrated
compassion for children.
</P>
<P>
   Finding someone outside of the education field with the skills
to make a good superintendent has not been easy, said Taylor, who
would not name the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things it takes to do this job you are more likely to find
in people who have done this (education) business,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, ``The candidate pool is not what people think it
is,'' Casserly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were in the private sector and you were good ... you
are going to have to take a pay cut, you are going to have to work
longer hours, you are going to get no thanks for this and you are
going to have to do it all in the public,'' he said. ``It's not a
leap that most in the private sector are eager to take.''

 &HT;    Judge orders USA Financial Network to stop selling securities
 &HT;    By Jim Dillon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A federal judge has ordered Dayton-based USA
Financial Network Inc. and affiliated companies to stop selling
securities and insurance while an independent consultant reviews
the companies' operations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Walter H. Rice of Dayton issued the
preliminary injunction recently at the request of the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Rice also approved the motion to appoint a mutually agreed upon
consultant, who will report on the ``continued viability'' of USA
Financial and associated companies within 30 days of appointment.
The report will likely be filed with the court sometime in January,
according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the SEC filed a lawsuit against USA Financial and
its operators, Craig A. Herl and Mark May, alleging the firm sold
$3.6 million in unsecured notes to unsophisticated investors in a
``typical Ponzi scheme.''
</P>
<P>
   Also named as defendants were five other companies: S-Corp.,
Financial Inc., Bancorp Mortgage Inc., Biltmore Development Corp.
and Network Financial Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit followed a one-year SEC investigation. Herl said
last month the lawsuit is ``totally without merit and ridiculous.''
Herl said the companies operate legitimate construction businesses
building homes in the Eaton area and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The civil action alleges that over the past four years, 33
investors _ mostly middle-income families in the Dayton area _ were
fraudulently sold promissory notes through companies with little or
no net worth. The alleged scheme involved using funds from new
investors to make payments to past investors.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the court froze the assets of May, 38, a Xenia
resident, and Herl, 37, of West Milton. Also frozen were the assets
of their companies plus those of May's wife, Cynthia, and USA
Trust. The lawsuit claims that from 1996 to 1998, about $292,500
was paid to Cynthia May as profit distributions although the
corporations never earned a profit.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, the court prohibited the companies from
transferring any funds or assets to the Mays or Herl.

 &HT;    Wild hogs the state's new scourge
 &HT;    By Willie Howard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wild hogs are rooting up Florida,
scarring the land, spreading nuisance plants, carrying disease and
creating headaches for managers of parks and preserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at a wild hog the same way we look at melaleuca
trees,'' said Robert Dye, manager of Myakka River State Park, where
a trapper removes 800 pigs annually just to control the population.
``One pig is too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Although pigs are pests to land managers such as Dye, hunters
love them. Some hunters want to extend the season for hunting pigs
on public land. At the same time, animal rights advocates want the
state to crack down on what they say is inhumane treatment of pigs
removed by trappers from state parks and preserves, where hunting
is not allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe hog populations are on the increase,'' said Nick
Wiley, chief of wildlife management for the Florida Game and Fresh
Water Fish Commission. ``Hunting with liberal seasons and bag
limits is effective at holding them at manageable levels. But
eradication takes trapping.''
</P>
<P>
   Pigs are not native to Florida. They were introduced by Hernando
DeSoto when he landed near Tampa Bay in 1539. And they have few
remaining natural enemies, such as the panther, to control their
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Wild pigs are the same animal, Sus scrofa, as domesticated pigs.
They're typically black, dark brown or dark red and weigh 100 to
400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The state's feral pig population has been estimated at 400,000,
though some wildlife experts believe the state harbors as many as 1
million free-roaming swine. Sows reproduce twice a year and deliver
an average of six piglets each time. The piglets, in turn, reach
sexual maturity in six months.
</P>
<P>
   Pigs eat roots, acorns, palmetto berries, worms and snakes,
gobbling up food eaten by native animals such as white-tailed deer
and wild turkeys. They also eat the eggs of native animals,
including those of snakes, ground-nesting birds, alligators and sea
turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pig is a pig is a pig, and you'd better believe they eat a
lot of anything,'' said Kim Delozier, a wildlife biologist at Great
Smokey Mountains National Park in Tennessee, where 300 pigs are
removed from the land annually to minimize their effect on plants
and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   At Cape Canaveral and the nearby Merritt Island National
Wildlife Refuge, trappers remove more than 2,000 wild pigs
annually. Using dogs and traps, they took 3,384 pigs from the
refuge last year. The Space Coast pigs have eaten sea turtle eggs;
NASA employees have hit them with their cars on the way to work.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the pig population is considered especially
important near the Kennedy Space Center because pigs can dig under
the fence that protects the space shuttle runway, though pigs have
never interfered with a shuttle landing.
</P>
<P>
   Wild pigs also contribute to the spread of noxious plants such
as the tropical soda apple. They eat the soda apple's acrid fruit,
then plant the seeds when they defecate in areas they've rooted.
</P>
<P>
   Because wild pigs can carry brucellosis, a blood-borne disease
that causes a recurrent fever, sweating and joint pain, hunters
must wear plastic gloves when cleaning them. Trapped wild pigs must
be separated from domestic pigs to prevent the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Feral pigs can be hard to spot in palmetto thickets, especially
in hot months when they stay in low-lying swamps and thick
underbrush. But their calling cards are unmistakable: deep furrows
created by rooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want them rooting up native vegetation,'' said Bert
Trammel, manager of the Dupuis Reserve in northern Palm Beach and
southern Martin counties, where hog-tilled turf looks like the work
of a tractor.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters killed 199 wild pigs last year at Dupuis Reserve. But
hunting is not allowed at state parks, where trappers capture the
pigs in cages baited with rotting corn or nab them with
pig-tracking dogs that grab them by the ears.
</P>
<P>
   Dog hunting and trapping have drawn fire from animal rights
groups. The Animal Rights Foundation of Florida wrote a letter to
Gov. Lawton Chiles, urging him to ensure that hogs do not suffer
when trapped in pens or captured by tracking dogs. The foundation
asked the game commission to develop guidelines to ensure that
hunters and trappers cause feral pigs no needless suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``These animals are not here of their own volition,'' ARFF
director Joe Taksel wrote in a June 29 letter to Chiles. ``The
state has no right to cause them needless suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles has asked state land managers to review their
hog-trapping policies to ensure the pigs are captured and
transported in a humane manner. But he noted that hog trapping must
continue as a management tool on public land.
</P>
<P>
   Dana Bryan, park management specialist with the state Department
of Environmental Protection, said pigs must be removed to keep them
in check at state parks. ``If we did nothing, the places would be
overrun,'' Bryan said. ``Every one you take off, there's going to
be less damage to the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Palm Beach County's natural areas, purchased with money
from a $100 million, voter-approved bond issue, harbor wild pigs.
``We do realize they're a problem we're going to have to deal
with,'' said Frank Griffiths, who manages the natural areas for the
county.
</P>
<P>
   But Griffiths does not consider the pigs a physical threat to
visitors unless they're cornered or harassed. ``Their natural
instinct is to run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although park managers loathe Florida's wild pigs, hunters love
them. They're plentiful, cagey and tasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to see them in the woods,'' said Robert Stossel Jr., a
West Palm Beach hunter and director of the Florida Wildlife
Federation. ``They've been here 500 years. I think they've got a
right to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Keith Jones of Lake Worth wants the game commission to
consider expanding the season for hog hunting to include some
summer hunts on wildlife management areas and reserves.
</P>
<P>
   On private land, pigs can be removed at any time of year
regardless of their size and are considered the livestock of the
landowner.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Fulford, owner of a 6,500-acre ranch in western Okeechobee
County, takes about 100 pigs a year from his land. Hunting pigs
provides food and allows Fulford to manage the pig population on
his ranch.
</P>
<P>
   When pigs root up his cattle-grazing pastures, Fulford said, the
damage can last 10 years. ``They can literally root up the world,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent dog hunt for pigs near Fulford's ranch with hunting
guide Ernie Goolsby and fellow dog hunter David Bruner, the hunters
let their dogs roam the land and followed them in four-wheel-drive
pickups.
</P>
<P>
   As they worked the dogs downwind of the oak hammocks where they
expected to find pigs feeding on fallen acorns, the dogs paused
from time to time to sniff the wind for the scent of swine.
</P>
<P>
   As they neared a small drainage canal, the dogs took off running
and started barking. Bruner and fellow hunter David Godfrey
followed the dogs across the canal, where they had cornered a small
pig. They rolled the pig on its back and killed it with a pocket
knife.
</P>
<P>
   About the same time, a multicolored pig came running across the
canal and Goolsby turned loose his catch dog, Blue, which ran out
of sight chasing the pig. Goolsby followed them in his bucking
pickup.
</P>
<P>
   When he caught up with Blue, the dog had lost the multicolored
pig and captured a young black boar by the ear. Goolsby, a veteran
rancher and cowboy, held the small boar down with his foot and
neutered it. The neutered boar will grow fatter than a nonneutered
one, Goolsby said, and it won't continue to sire piglets.
</P>
<P>
   Pig hunting with dogs has been a tradition on Florida ranches
for decades. Goolsby, 35, learned to capture hogs with dogs at age
15. Friends and relatives often gather on the Fulford ranch for
weekend hunts, which sometimes last late into the night and include
the children.
</P>
<P>
   Cur hounds used to track and hold wild pigs are often working
ranch dogs used to herd cattle. Pig hunting imposes risks on the
dogs because big boars have tusks that can wound or kill a dog. But
cur dogs aren't the least bit intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bred into them to be aggressive for that kind of
hunting,'' said Claude Thomas of the National Cur and Feist
Breeders Association. ``They're extremely strong dogs that could go
all night for a month in a row if they needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunters, too, can be gouged by a tusky boar that has been
captured by dogs. Goolsby has a few scars on his hands. Bruner said
he has never been cut after 25 years of hog hunting, but he has
friends who have gotten stitches.
</P>
<P>
   As with the dogs, the risk of going mano a mano with a wild boar
doesn't deter those who love dog hunts for pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real adrenaline rush,'' Bruner said.

 &HT;    Poster captures son's, health council's anti-smoking plea
 &HT;    By Jim DeBrosse
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Twelve-year-old Kevin Hickman has been after his
mom for months to quit smoking, ever since he learned in his
classes at Allen Classical Academy in Dayton about the dangers of
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Karen Hall, has promised she'll try to kick her
25-year-old habit. But if she doesn't, she'll soon have looming
reminders of her son's wish: 10-foot-high billboards of a poster
Kevin designed for a local anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The poster shows a teen-age girl visiting the grave site of her
mother and crying, ``Mom, I miss you.'' Behind the girl, a talking
cigarette sneers, ``Do you want to die, too?''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin submitted the winning poster among 114 entries from
second- through sixth-graders at Allen, where teachers were
approached by the Miami Valley Health Improvement Council for a
child's drawing to be featured in a monthlong billboard campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about quitting for a long time, but now I
should at least try,'' said Hall, a 40-year-old Dayton resident and
mother of two.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards will go up in late December at six locations in
Montgomery, Clark and Miami counties, including a site near the
Nutter Center. The advertising tab will be picked up by a $25,000
grant from the Physicians Charitable Foundation of the Miami
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the health improvement council thought a child's
poster would be more effective than one more slick message from an
advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin's art teacher at Allen, Martha Stegeman, agreed. ``There
is something about the innocence and honesty of a child that is so
poignant,'' she said. ``You don't walk away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim Freeman, an education consultant for the health improvement
council, said she was surprised at how many of the student entries
were personal pleas for parents and grandparents to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this will help,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin said he decided to make a teen-ager the focus of his
poster after reading an article about the growing number of
American teens who are taking up the smoking habit.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Valley is no exception. Nearly one-fourth (23 percent)
of Dayton-area 12th-graders smoke cigarettes on a daily basis, and
nearly 15 percent smoke a half pack or more per day, according to
the latest Dayton Area Drug Survey, a collaborative effort among
Wright State University, United Health Services and Dayton-area
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kevin, he's already decided tobacco is not for him. ``I
want to run track and stuff when I'm older, but I can't do that if
I smoke,'' he said. ``I'd be all out of breath.

 &HT;    Austin FilmWorks students learn by doing a full-length feature
film, `In Flagrante'
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jeanne Claire van Ryzin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``Lights, camera, action.'' Not exactly three
inexpensive words for a beginning filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   When ``In Flagrante,'' a black-and-white comedy, premiered at
the Dobie Theatre on Thursday, its credits listed 14 producers. A
little outside the film industry norm to be sure, but that's
because ``In Flagrante'' was the first feature film to be made by a
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of any place else that offers students an
opportunity to make a full-length feature film,'' said Stephen
Mims, filmmaker and founder of Austin FilmWorks, which offers
college-level filmmaking courses to the general public. Since
starting Austin FilmWorks in 1993, Mims has offered two
semester-long courses that emphasize a hands-on approach to the
basics of film and video production.
</P>
<P>
   But after students completed the two classes, Mims said, they
were still looking for more learning opportunities. ``People would
ask us what they're supposed to do next,'' he said. That prompted
the creation of a third production course, a 12-month class during
which the students would produce their own feature film.
</P>
<P>
   The class began in January. David Layton, 32, a local filmmaker
and former student of Mims', co-taught the course. Students paid
$1,050 for the class and shared the responsibility of either
raising or contributing an equal share of the film's total budget.
Class members estimate that the ``In Flagrante'' budget was between
$9,000 and $10,000, a budget that could easily have been two to
three times more had not Austin FilmWorks provided the equipment
and editing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of first feature films are very, very expensive learning
experiences,'' said Mims, 39, who received his master's degree in
film at the University of Texas and later taught film production
there for four years. ``This is a way to do it for a fraction of
the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, Mims and Layton set some hard and fast
criteria for the project and demanded that students be committed to
it. At the first class, Mims showed students a clip from ``Red
River'' in which John Wayne's character tells his cowboys that if
they want out of the cattle drive, that's fine, but if they leave
they'll be shot. The scare tactic worked. Of the 15 students who
registered for the class (all of whom had taken previous Austin
FilmWorks classes), only one left, and he did so to attend New York
University's prestigious screenwriting program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically presented them with a structure that could not be
surrendered,'' Layton said. At the same time, Mims and Layton left
the class on its own to solve problems. ``We really let the class
sort themselves out,'' Mims said.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not a school, and therefore doesn't offer any
academic credit, Austin FilmWorks nevertheless seems to have found
its niche among degree-seeking film students, many of whom find the
few spaces in university production courses out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process to get into production classes at UT is
ridiculous,'' said Robert Robinson, 26, a part-time film major at
UT. ``This is a great alternative. It's a novel way to make an
independent film.'' Robinson worked as ``In Flagrante's'' co-editor
and boom operator. Part of the project's appeal, he said, was its
demands. ``At least I knew that this film would be finished.''
</P>
<P>
   When designing the course, Mims and Layton decided that the
script had to be generated, and voted on, by the students. Thomas
R. Chamberlain authored the winning script. ``In Flagrante'' tells
the story of new homeowners, Mia and Colin, who quickly learn they
live next door to the neighborhood eccentrics, three adult
siblings, the Dalrymples, whose inheritance and quirky behavior has
the neighborhood buzzing with rumors of their murderous family
history.
</P>
<P>
   The movie features a cast of local actors. Filming took place
during six weeks of stifling heat in July and August in an empty
fraternity house without air conditioning. ``It really went
remarkably well considering how miserable (the weather) was,''
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the eclectic group of students (among others, a lawyer,
an Apple Computer employee and a single mother of three) had to fit
the busy production schedule around full-time careers and full-time
lives. Kathy Farry, 26, who works at Motorola, said her employer
was very supportive of her while she took on the role as the film's
second assistant camera operator. ``I took vacation time and
changed my shifts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its success, Mims plans to offer the course again in
January. And what will this new crop of potential Robert
Rodriguezes (who, by the way, was Mim-- ' student at UT) and
Richard Linklaters do? Robinson said he'll continue working on his
degree and hopes to find paying work in filmmaking. Farry plans to
head to Los Angeles in a year or so to try her luck in the film
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their next step, ```In Flagrante,' a feature film'' is
bound to headline their resumes.

 &HT;    `Iso' is oh so nice for Longhorns
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ricky Brown is a sensitive sort, a soft-spoken
soul who writes love poems and takes pride in his recent Sports
Illustrated cover. (That's him in the lower left, or at least his
back, anyway.)
</P>
<P>
   Mention, though, how the Longhorns gashed Baylor with what has
become the Horns' bread-and-butter play _ the ``iso,'' in which
Brown leads halfback Ricky Williams up the middle _ and his eyes
light up at the mere mention of the associated carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Never was it more effective than on their last two touchdown
drives against the Bears, when the Horns ran it on six of their
last seven plays. It gained 47 yards and resulted in two touchdowns
to give Texas a 30-20 come-from-behind win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hypes me up when the coaches say, `We're coming at you,
right side, every time,''' Brown said. ``It's physical domination.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go right at them, you look at (the linebacker) from
your stance and he looks at you. He knows you're coming, and
there's nothing he can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Davis loves the play, too. It's a staple in most offensive
play books, and its macho challenge makes it a favorite of the old
school. ``First and foremost, it's an old-timey football play,''
the Longhorns' offensive coordinator said. ``I think the old-timers
would call it solid.''
</P>
<P>
   It might be called more than that _ like the play Davis calls
Friday for the carry that took Williams to the NCAA Division I-A
career rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every football team has the play, some just run it more than
others,'' Davis said. ``It depends on the fullback and the
offensive line, if they're those kind of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has ``those kind of guys.'' In Brown, a compactly built
6-foot, 222-pounder, they have the perfect lead blocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many times you see Ricky (Williams) running, but you don't
see the other Ricky in front, putting his head in somebody's
chest,'' quarterback Major Applewhite said. ``It's easy to cut off
a linebacker when a 230-pound fullback's in his chest.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line, with an average weight of 310 pounds, can
manhandle defensive fronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier for the line, easier to block,'' Williams said.
``They're so big and physical, it's to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The play is fairly simple, with the key elements being Brown's
lead block against the strongside or weakside linebacker and the
double-team with the center and guard.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he reads the blocks just like he imagines Williams
would. ``If it's cluttered inside, I'll try to take my man
outside,'' Brown said. ``I think, `Would Ricky want to go inside?
Would he want to go outside? Where would Ricky want to go?'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams can either follow behind Brown and cut off of his block
or, if he sees that hole being clogged, cut back behind the
double-team block of the guard and center.
</P>
<P>
   Said Williams: ``There are two ways I can go, so it's hard for
the defense to be right. I see a crease, and I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The iso can be run from a variety of formations, including a
split-back, but Texas runs it from the I and offset-I formations.
It can be run four ways _ right or left, strong side or weakside.
</P>
<P>
   It has its complements, too. A play-action pass version relies
on Williams' running threat to open a short middle route for
flanker Kwame Cavil or a deeper pass for split end Wane McGarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fake to Ricky and throw the ball downfield,'' Davis said.
``Many of Wane's big catches come off the fake, when you get the
linebackers to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas self-scouts to determine its own tendencies, and in doing
that it records, among other things, the number of times it runs a
play, the average gain and the consistency of the play. Consistency
is measured in the number of times the play gains 4 or more yards
and/or results in a first down or touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shoot for about 60 percent consistency on our plays,''
Davis said. ``The iso is about 65 percent and probably averages
close to 6 yards a carry.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the value of the iso, it's not the most productive play
in the book. That distinction goes to the lead draw, the iso's slow
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing is that the draw is blocked similar to
the iso, but with a different tempo,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   In the draw, Brown and Williams first stand up as if setting
into pass protection before heading to the hole. The linemen don't
fire out but use a pass-blocking set to convince the defensive line
it's a pass play.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has run it 35 times this year _ mostly earlier in the year
before opponents caught on _ and it averaged 10.1 yards a play and
67 percent consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get my guy down, I know I'll look up and see Ricky
running down the field for a score,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas doesn't run the draw much any more after great
early-season success, because defenses are looking for it. They're
looking for the iso now, too, but that doesn't always seem to
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can average 6 yards a carry it's a good play,''
Applewhite said. ``Actually, any time it's in Ricky's hands, it's a
good play.''

 &HT;    Family's high-wattage tradition started with a single strand
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's Thanksgiving night, and they wait in the
front yard of a modest South Austin home. Hollow plastic figures
cast in the likeness of Santa, baby Jesus and snowmen. Endless
strands of multicolored lights covering every bit of greenery, wood
and plaster. A ``chandelier'' made of cocktail cups and an angel
with its eyes pointed toward heaven. Wooden cut-outs of wreaths,
reindeer and glittering, holiday-attired Mickey and Minnie Mouse,
Donald Duck and Goofy holding a sign wishing a ``Merry Christmas
from the Boortz family.''
</P>
<P>
   They all wait to be brought to life.
</P>
<P>
   In the increasingly darkening yard, Dean Boortz, the creator, is
wedged in the bushes, affixing bows to his aluminum-covered
shudders to make them look like presents. He has left his turkey
dinner and missed his wife's famous peach pie for this. At 5:30
p.m., the timer that lights the entire display directs power to the
scene and ``O Little Town of Bethlehem'' starts playing on a loop.
The wise men are illuminated as are Snoopy and the carolers. Dean
keeps working on the details, knowing he will be the only one to
notice. He half-believes the Christmas season can't start without
his yard being perfect. And it won't be perfect without his bows.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, Dean Boortz lighted his front yard on
Village Way Drive for the first time. There were no timers, just
him plugging an extension cord into an outlet for a single string
of lights in a tree. Upon seeing the lights, Dean's stepdaughter,
Shari, named it the ``lollipop tree.'' She was 4.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed. Shari is 29, married and has a 3-year-old
(Cole) and an 11-month-old (Brad). Dean, now 57, has also changed.
When he first strung up those lights, he was a hair stylist; now he
owns a driving range. His glasses are thicker now, as is his girth.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, his yard has changed. The lollipop tree has grown
into a yuletide carnival: a somewhat frightening, happily lighted
place surrealistically complete with a glowing Winnie the Pooh,
ropes of lights that spell out ``Noel'' and Mormon Tabernacle Choir
tunes piped in.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to judge, know there's more here than just an
eye-popping display of how cacophonous Christmas has become, more
than a statement on how one of the most sacred of Christian
holidays has bent to commercialism, kitsch and polyurethane
messiahs. Because, when it comes down to it, we're all like Dean.
All semi-obsessed with the season as we figuratively put up our own
displays _ watching Christmas specials at Thanksgiving, walking
past the bell-ringing Salvation Army volunteer with an armful of
gifts and buying soda from Coca-Cola-inspired Santas.
</P>
<P>
   This display defines Dean's holiday season, and much of the rest
of the year as well. It's his great obsession, and it elates and
worries him. The endless strands of tiny, twinkling lights are like
a love that holds him too tightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year I say, `This is going to be my last year,' but then
I get a couple weeks into it and I start to get into the spirit,''
he says. ``And then you see the faces of the kids _ their faces all
smooshed up against the car windows _ and that's when it's all
worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch Santa shake his hips
</P>
<P>
   It is Nov. 8 _ one day before Dean and his son, Jeff, 34, will
begin their 17-day task of piecing together their ode to the
holiday season; the attic is still packed with thousands upon
thousands of dollars' worth of Christmas lights and holiday icons.
At the back of the attic, some of the figures are standing in what
looks like a line for unemployed Christmas figurines. A snowman
models behind a somber-faced Joseph deep in prayer. At the front of
the line is a group of singing carolers, looking confident they
will make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Downstairs, Dean, with his shoes off and feet propped up on his
couch, and his wife, Taryien, sip Burgundy wine (``It has almost no
carbohydrates,'' he says), while trying to describe what their yard
will look like. By the kitchen, a mechanized Santa gyrates his hips
to ``Jingle Bell Rock'' and the couple's two Chihuahuas, Ginger and
Tootsie, yip at their feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, one side of the yard is the Christian side, and the
other is the fantasy side,'' Dean says. His cadence is slow and
drenched in a drawl. ``You see, on the fantasy side we have a
snowman village. We have 15 snowmen we set up there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure there are that many?'' Taryien cuts in. She is
blond and looks like a younger, healthier Mrs. Claus. A Mrs. Claus
who enjoys a carbohydrate-less Burgundy now and then.
</P>
<P>
   Dean thinks for a second, then nods slowly. ``Then we have a
30-foot roll of red lights that we spell out the word `Joy,'
J-O-Y.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Joy' is red?'' she asks. ``I thought it was white.''
</P>
<P>
   After this cycle is repeated a few more times, the two finally
agree. They say they do it for the neighborhood and for Austin.
It's a Christmas gift from the Boortz-- s to their city. Especially
the kids, Dean says. He loves doing it for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   But it's always been that way. It has always been a gift. When
Dean first strung up his lights in 1973, it was during the energy
crisis. President Jimmy Carter had begged us to turn down our
thermostats and conserve energy. Dean says his block was dark, no
lights anywhere. His tree in his front yard was a lone beacon, a
blue, red, green and white sign of the season. A defiant,
heart-warming message to everyone: ``Merry Christmas, there's no
energy crisis here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lighting the lollipop
</P>
<P>
   One week into the decoration process, Dean, his son, Jeff, and
Larry, a day laborer who has helped Dean for the past five years,
work into the night. Gordian knots of lights and piles of figures
lie on the backyard patio. A space has been cleared where baby
Jesus sleeps restfully.
</P>
<P>
   Years of putting up Christmas lights have spawned innovations.
In fact, Dean claims, he has shown Austin a number of lighting
techniques now widely used by others, including: 1) running a
string of lights through plastic Solo cups and framing his yard in
them (``I nail them to the ground and they look like beams going
all around the yard.''), and 2) wrapping his tree trunks in foil
before running lights around them, therefore giving the
``shimmering appearance of ice.'' (``I remember a fire marshal
sitting outside my house one night, just looking at them. Not sure
what to do. He'd never seen that before.'')
</P>
<P>
   The three finish wrapping the trees in foil and, at the last
second, decide to wrap the mailbox for continuity. Another first.
Next, they take on the task of stringing the lollipop tree.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff, a more rotund version of his father, but with less hair,
is easygoing and as talkative and knowledgeable about the Boortz
display and its history as his father. He is eloquent and precise
in his storytelling and doublechecks statistics with his father.
Years, dates, voltages, watts and lengths of strings of lights are
verified for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jeff grew up with his mom in Midland, he kept up with his
father and Dean's second wife. Of great interest was his father's
annual yuletide obsession. Over the years, Dean has collected other
illuminating Christmas knickknacks to put in his yard. He is a
monthly fixture at Canton's famous flea market in East Texas and
Hobby Lobby's after-Christmas lights sale. The display grew. The
yard became a trade show for the newest plastic Christmas figures
and flashing lights. More important, it became a point of pride,
Dean says, a focal point for the whole neighborhood. It was,
everyone told him, where the holiday season officially started.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Jeff explains, the ``competition'' got under way and
the modern, amorphous tangle of lights and wooden Santas began to
take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Dean cuts in and explains how he and a friend named Ronny Smith
were having a conversation one day, the conversation that led to
the contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to Ronny, and he said, `I'm going to have the
best lights in South Austin.''' Dean laughs to himself at the
memory, shaking his head. ``And I said, `No, you're going to have
the second best lights in South Austin.'''
</P>
<P>
   The two stop talking to concentrate on getting an errant strand
of lights into the top of the tree. Dean swings the string like a
lasso and loops the lights on a tall branch. The lollipop tree is
complete, and the yard is bathed in multicolored light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty, always pretty,'' says Larry, staring up at the lights.
``It looks very nice, very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   A dark Christmas
</P>
<P>
   Ronny Smith's red-brick house sits on a corner down the street.
It is dark except for a few lights in the window. A few years ago,
Ronny was diagnosed with cancer and stopped putting up his lights.
He's been sick, he says, with a disease of the legs and can't stay
on them too long. His back is killing him, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to get some help and put a few lights up, but not like
he used to. Back then, he says, he had a 10-foot, fully lit,
Styrofoam Santa and his sleigh and eight six-foot reindeer. When he
couldn't put them up anymore, he gave all his lights and the
Styrofoam Santa to his son-in-law. He hated having to do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty close there between me and Dean,'' Ronny says.
``But he always had me beat. Best lights in the city if you ask
me.'' Ronny stops. His clear blue eyes look empty. ``Man, I wish I
could be doing it again. Doing it like Dean does it.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes a snowman village
</P>
<P>
   In the 12 years since Jeff moved to Austin, his creative input
has been essential to the Boortz-- s' frontyard extravaganza. Jeff
walks around the yard and points to the displays that were his
ideas. He stops in front of a plastic snowman. This was his stroke
of genius. One day in 1989, he noticed that Dean had 15 snowmen,
which were placed all around the yard at random. Then came the
idea: Why not put them together, he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were together,'' he says as he straightens a line of
lights strung vertically on the side of the house, ``then they
could be a village. It would be a snowman village.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff then had the idea to nail a sheet to the ground and cover
the wires trailing out of the back of the plastic snowmen with
garland. Voila, a snowman village.
</P>
<P>
   ``At night, the sheet looks like they're on snow,'' he says.
``It really does.''
</P>
<P>
   As their holiday monument takes shape, Dean and Jeff work their
regular jobs during the day and work nights under the Christmas
lights, sometimes until after midnight. First, the windows are
covered with mylar and plastic ribbon, then wooden candy cane
cut-outs are hung. A plastic church scene, complete with a singing
mother, father and child, is placed near the front of the yard. An
outline of Santa and his reindeer goes on the roof, then is covered
with lights. On a creative whim, Jeff glues glitter-covered fake
snowflakes to tree branches above his snowman village.
</P>
<P>
   That weekend Shari comes in from Schertz. Andy, her husband, is
away at National Guard training. She stands in front of the house
while Cole, in a Spiderman shirt (complete with webbing under the
arms), plays in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been doing this as long as I can remember,'' she says.
``But it hasn't been like this,'' she says waving her hand around,
``since I was in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean stops and watches Cole run around. While he insists he does
it for Austin, this display is mostly for Shari's kids. After all,
Dean needs the inspiration. In the past 10 years, he and Taryien
have lost their fathers. His mother, who loved the lights, passed
away last year, and the days of his competitions with Ronny are
over. Besides, he says, it's hard and takes a lot of time and
money. He can't go on winter vacations in case a circuit blows, and
he's afraid to sell his house for fear the next resident wouldn't
put up lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, those people call and ask me if I want siding put on
the house,'' he says placing a seven-foot angel, draped in a
gauze-like material, in the center of his lawn. ``I want the
siding. I need siding. But I got all these hooks and outlets for
the lights that would have to be moved. It's a burden.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfectionist's inch
</P>
<P>
   With Thanksgiving five days away, Jeff leaves with friends to
spend the holiday in Atlanta. Now working alone, Dean is on the
ground with a tape measure, driving plastic stakes in the ground
exactly 24 inches apart. He will run a string from stake to stake.
The string, he explains, serves two purposes. First, it keeps
people off the lawn (he has set the string two feet back after
measuring how far a car door could swing out without hitting the
barrier). Second, the string stretches all the way around his yard,
with running lights attached. The lights will circle his yard
giving it a sort of holiday-meets-runway-meets-''X Files'' effect.
It's real neat, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Patiently inspecting his work to make sure everything is in a
straight line, Dean occasionally uses a pipe cleaner to realign a
single light. If a wooden wreath isn't centered, down it comes. If
the row of plastic cups, which have been hole-punched earlier, look
crooked, they are dug up and repositioned. A half-inch variation
can warrant a major correction. (The cups, to Dean's disdain, are
the 7-ounce size, not the preferred 9-ouncers.) Dean says he's
goofy that way. He's either totally into something or not at all.
This has become such tradition for him, such a part of him, he
can't help but put all of himself into it.
</P>
<P>
   Ronny drives by, waves and stops. He gets out and leans heavily
against the side of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking good, Dean, looking good,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know; I think it looks like hell,'' Dean answers,
critiquing his 16 days of work.
</P>
<P>
   A moment of silence passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronny, how did we get into this?'' Dean asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know,'' Ronny answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to be crazy,'' Dean says. ``You got to be crazy to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripping the lights Once the lights go on and Dean is finally
happy with the details, he crosses the street to admire his work.
The burden is lifted for another year. He smiles as he surveys his
yard. The green wires and hollow plastic icons create a beautiful
illusion of Christmas. A place where Santa smiles, frozen in a
wave. Nutcra-- kers stand in perfect formation, and baby Jesus
rests peacefully in a manger. This is the beginning of the
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen minutes after Dean's holiday lights turn on their
magic,the first carload of parents and children drives slowly by.
As predicted, the little ones' faces are ``smooshed'' up against
the window. ``O Little Town of Bethlehem'' plays for the 11th time.
Dean nods his head toward the car. His dreams, and ours along with
them, have been fulfilled.

 &HT;    Bird watchers focus on high-tech aids
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Along with the familiar binoculars strapped
around their necks, bird watchers are increasingly going high tech,
carrying laptop computers and digital cameras into the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really kind of neat,'' naturalist Dane Mutter said.
``You can log on about noon and see pictures of birds around the
state that were observed that morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Computers are fast changing other aspects of bird watching as
well.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Christmas Bird Count, one of the largest events
every year for the Dayton Audubon Society, will be linked by
computer to BirdSource, a mapping and data basing project developed
by the National Audubon Society and the Cornell University
laboratory of ornithology.
</P>
<P>
   Observations from the annual count of early winter birds in the
Miami Valley will be added to sightings from bird watchers all over
North America. Last year 49,122 participants across the country
counted a record number of species (650). Fed into the Cornell
computers, the information is almost instantly available, showing
trends in bird populations and migrations.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Miami Valley Christmas Bird Count will be Jan. 3. It
involves groups of watchers from novice to professional who stake
out 15-mile sections and count the various species from midnight to
midnight on the chosen day. Watchers try to cover as much of the
area as possible and must stay out at least eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   Local results will be compiled Jan. 5 at the Aullwood Audubon
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Christmas Bird Count was started by conservationist Frank
Chapman on Christmas Day, 1900, as a reaction to an annual holiday
event called a ``side hunt,'' in which the team that shot the most
birds was the winner.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the 74th year for the Miami Valley bird count.
Sightings range from the rare, such as the common loon (one) to the
common, such as Canada geese (1,162).
</P>
<P>
   Mutter, who works the downtown corridor, usually spots the pair
of Peregrine falcons that nest in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   This past spring BirdSource at Cornell completed the task of
entering all of the Christmas Bird Count data back to 1900. With
animated maps on the BirdSource Internet site, individual species
are tracked for their abundance. The program has become a valuable
wildlife study tool.
</P>
<P>
   BirdSource noted the return of the American kestrel, which has
all but disappeared from much of North America in the 1950s.
Because the kestrel eats what humans consider pests, small insects
and mammals, scientists believe its return coincided with the
banning of the pesticide DDT in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also have the Cooper's hawk, which we thought was gone
forever but now it's fairly common,'' said Mutter, who has been
part of the Christmas Bird Count for 18 years.

 &HT;    Former Baptist blacks finding faith, refuge in Catholic Church
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Charlise Lyles
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ At age 19, Mary Johnson, reared as a devout black
Baptist, found a new faith.
</P>
<P>
   At St. Luke Baptist Church, she had heard the gospel choir
singing, swaying and shouting, the congregation stomping and
dancing about, the preacher belting out a vigorous, cadenced
sermon. All were the staples of black Protestant worship rooted in
the deep South. And they were all that Johnson knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always so confusing for me,'' she said. ``It was
distracting. The decibel level was really high. I never knew what
anyone was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one Sunday, her husband-to-be, Jerome Johnson, took her to
Mass. He had been raised Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   At St. John the Baptist Church, the solemn liturgy, the
flickering candles and meditative organ music moved her spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was quiet, serene adoration _ a direct contrast,'' said
Johnson, now 53 and a nurse who lives in Jefferson Twp. with her
husband. ``The music was beautiful and quiet. It was conducive to
contemplation, and at that time in my life that is what I needed. I
thought, `Hmmm, maybe this is where I belong.' ''
</P>
<P>
   She soon converted.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she is among the 2.3 million black Catholics in the
United States who celebrate November as Black Catholic History
Month. They hope that recognition of black contributions to the
Roman church will assist efforts to attract more blacks to
Catholicism. Bolstering their cause is the recent election of
Bishop Wilton Gregory of Illinois as vice president of the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, the first black to hold an office
in that group, and rumors that Nigerian-born Cardinal Francis
Arinze is a possible successor to Pope John Paul II. He would be
the first pope of color since 496 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   The Archdiocese of Cincinnati's 500,000 Catholics includes 4,000
to 6,000 blacks, and about 10 predominantly black parishes. There
is one black parish pastor. The Rev. Freddie Washington leads the
merged Dayton parish of St. James and Resurrection Church.
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, the two congregations will become St. Simon of Cyrene
Church and move into a new building.
</P>
<P>
   Evangelization is the major challenge facing blacks in the
Catholic Church, said George Findley, director of the archdiocese's
Office of African-American Ministries. Winning converts or inviting
strays back to the fold requires debunking an entirely different
set of stereotypes and myths about the Catholic Church, Findley
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many African-Americans who do not believe that there
are black Catholics. Those who know there are wonder why they are
members of a white church,'' he said. ``The programs that I do are
designed to show that from the beginning of the Catholic church,
there were blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s and '50s, Catholic schools were a primary
proselytizing vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were blacks who moved from the South to the North and
sought out a better education for their children in Catholic
schools,'' said the Rev. Clarence Williams of the Archdiocese of
Detroit, which has about 30,000 black members. ``For example, in
1950 there were 8,000 blacks in Chicago. But by 1970, there were
80,000. ``
</P>
<P>
   But that avenue of conversion is waning, said Cecilia Moore, a
professor of religious studies at the University of Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schools in urban areas are having to close down because they
don't have the funding,'' Moore said. ``I think African-American
Catholics need to be concerned about things we can do to keep
Catholic schools in the inner city alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The pronouncements of Vatican II, which allowed cultural
integration with traditional Catholic liturgy, may have energized
evangelization.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the gospel music and expressive preaching that Mary
Johnson experienced in the Baptist church can be found in many
black Catholic services. They often are vibrant with the trappings
and traditions of African-American worship: kente cloth vestments,
drums, a choir with a saxophone. At St. James/
</P>
<P>
   Resurrection, Father Freddie is known as a singing preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very ironic,'' said Mary Johnson, who attends St. James.
``I love the fact that worship is becoming more Afrocentric. At the
same time, I miss the quiet serenity that is conducive for me to
give over to complete prayer. I like the meditative prayer. . . . I
like the celebratory prayer. I think there has to be a balance in
worship.'' Black Catholics face the same shortage of vocations as
whites, says the Institute for Black Catholic Studies at Xavier
University. The United States has 14 black bishops but no black
cardinals. Among a handful of black Marianists in the United
States, the Rev. Paul Marshall is a member of the Cincinnati
province.
</P>
<P>
   But persons of African descent were present in the Roman church
centuries before the first black Catholics arrived in Florida with
the Spaniards in the 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   Saints of color include St. Apollonia, St. Anthony and St.
Martin de Porres of Peru, whom Pope John XXII declared the first
black American saint in 1962. And scholars still debate the hue of
revered St. Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   If Nigerian Cardinal Arinze succeeds Pope Jean Paul II, he would
be the fourth pope of color:
</P>
<P>
   Less than 200 years after the death of Jesus Christ, Pope Victor
I served from 189 to 199 A.D. Victor bore a Latin name like many
Africans of the time. He is buried at St. Peter's Basilica in
Vatican City.
</P>
<P>
   Miltiades, a black priest from Africa, was elected the 37th pope
in 311 A.D. Under Miltiades' reign, the Roman Emperor Constantine
was converted to Christianity and Roman persecutions of Christians
are believed to have ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Pope Gelasius I served in the fifth century, from 492 to 496. He
was revered for his modest lifestyle and care of the poor. Gelasius
is also credited as the first pope to advocate separation of church
and state.
</P>
<P>
   Could there be an African pope in 2000?
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Williams of Detroit has considered the rumors
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard that the chances of having an African become pope
are very good. I've also heard the same is true for Latin
America,'' said Williams in a telephone interview from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The argument that I've heard is that the church is growing so
much in Africa right now and because the church is so vital in
Africa, that makes the possibility of having a pope from Africa
much greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Africa boasts 130 million Catholics, compared with 73.6 million
in North America, not including the Caribbean. Latin America has
about 60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Africa has no shortage of black priests, Williams said. In fact,
``the United States is a kind of mission again and Africans are
supplying priests and sisters to serve in our parishes here,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Francis Tandoh of Ghana assists in Dayton's St.
James/Resurrection parish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you travel outside the United States,'' Williams said,
``you'll find that most persons of African descent who are
Christian are Catholic.

DIGITIZED ARTIFACTS MAKING KNOWLEDGE AVAILABLE TO ALL, ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By JO THOMAS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston was threatened by smallpox, and from his nearby
headquarters in Cambridge, Mass., George Washington ordered his
troops to stay out of the city. It was March 19, 1776, and the
orders were written by hand.
</P>
<P>
   This letter and hundreds of others in their original form can be
read on the Internet at the American Memory site of the Library of
Congress, one of the libraries leading the way in a quiet
revolution that is changing the way knowledge is shared around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   From papyri to Civil War letters and diaries, from old baseball
cards to photographs of Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull, millions of
unique items in libraries, archives and museums are being digitized
and made available in facsimile on the Internet to anyone, not just
scholars with the time and money to travel.
</P>
<P>
   Many items can be located through an automated system of finding
aids developed over the last five years by a group that has
included university librarians, the Society of American Archivists
and the Library of Congress. Finding aids describe what is in the
folders and boxes in which libraries and archives keep their
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is going to change the whole organization of
knowledge,'' said Timothy Hoyer, head of technical services at the
Bancroft Library of the University of California at Berkeley, which
has been in on the cutting edge of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers involved are huge: The Library of Congress, which
has 117 million items in its archives, hopes to have 4 million
items digitized and accessible on the World Wide Web by the turn of
the century. The Denver Public Library expects to put 95,000
photographs of the old West online. California has linked 35
universities and museums into one online archive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Public Records Office in London, archivists are creating
a catalog of all British public records dating to the Domesday Book
of the 11th century.
</P>
<P>
   With help from experts at New York University, the New-York
Historical Society is trying to digitize one of the great American
history collections.
</P>
<P>
   No one place is available online where Web users can search the
finding aids for all these collections. But the Research Libraries
Group, an international alliance of 160 institutions, including
universities, libraries, archives and museums, has set up an
Archival Resources service that is moving toward this.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision goes back to the Enlightenment,'' said Daniel
Pitti, project director of the Institute for Advanced Technology in
the Humanities at the University of Virginia. ``It was the dream of
the scholar to go to one place and find out what exists, where it
is, and what they need to get access.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an illusion to think we'll digitize everything out there
_ we're talking about hundreds of millions of items,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Copies of items that have been digitized have occasionally been
more interesting than the originals. A digitized photo of the San
Francisco earthquake of 1906, for example, can be manipulated to
see paintings on the walls of buildings that cannot be seen in the
original photograph. A piece of papyrus, enlarged on a computer,
does not have to be viewed under a microscope. It was papyrus that
led some archivists to think of constructing digitized collections
so that valuable, fragile materials would not be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 1,500 pieces of papyri dating back to 4,000 B.C.,''
said Steven Hensen, director of planning and project development in
the rare book, manuscript and special collections library at Duke
University.
</P>
<P>
   While Duke was photographing and cataloguing its collection, he
said, ``the World Wide Web burst upon the scene, and we had this
flash: Why make photos? Why not scan them and see if we can put
them up on the Web and make them accessible worldwide?''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roger Bagnall, professor of classics and history at Columbia
University, is heading an effort by Duke, Columbia, the University
of Michigan, Berkeley, Yale and Princeton to build a virtual
collection of 50,000 pieces of papyri that could eventually be
linked to collections in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are, ultimately, going to have translations for everything
that's actually been read,'' Bagnall said, ``and anything with a
Greek text will also have an English text.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened in papyrus could happen with other unique
collections, said Stephen Griffin, head of the division of
information and intelligent systems at the National Science
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A collection of photographs, maps and texts at a University of
Virginia Web site called ``The Valley of the Shadow,'' an archive
of two communities, Staunton, Va., and Chambersburg, Pa., on
opposite sides of the Mason-Dixon line during the Civil War, has
been visited by 2 million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to tell the story of the Civil War on a human
level,'' said Edward Ayres, a history professor who first thought
of the project. First on a computer and then on the Internet, he
and a colleague, William Thomas, tried to see ``if we could put out
all the raw materials out of which historians construct the past in
ways people who are not historians could explore,'' Ayres said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is that you'll slowly see, in your own mind, a
three-dimensional world emerge,'' he said. ``If you read the census
entries and see that a soldier is 48 and has left three young
children at home, and he's a widower, all of a sudden the lines in
his letters have a different meaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Endowment for the Humanities has supported this and
other projects throughout the country to make cultural resources
available on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would gain the country little if we spent millions to
preserve materials and no one knew where they were, or if we spent
millions to gain access to materials that couldn't be seen because
they were too fragile,'' said George Farr, director of the division
of preservation and access at the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   At the Library of Congress, the manuscript division is closed to
high school students and most university undergraduates. Even
scholars can only look at presidential manuscripts on microfiche.
But at the American Memory site, the Washington letters can be seen
in their original form. The site gets 10 million to 12 million
visits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly we have clients who couldn't come through our
doors,'' said Hoyer, who helps direct the online archive of the
California Digital Library.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Yesson, manager of the California Heritage project at the
Berkeley library, has been helping elementary school teachers use
the California Heritage Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A fourth-grade class in Oakland did a unit on the gold rush
and went to Sutter's Fort,'' she said. ``Then they went to the
California Heritage site to see what it looked like back in the
gold rush.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected result, she said, was the students' relationship
with the university. Once teachers explained what an archive was,
the students wanted to come to campus to see the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the few times that archivists have found
themselves leading the parade,'' Hensen said. ``We're used to
sweeping up behind the elephants.''

 &HT;    Kitschy classics hot on collector's lists
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Bette Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Forget Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgic baby boomers are snapping up creamy green Anchor
Hocking Fire-King glass kitchenware from the '40s and '50s, nesting
Pyrex mixing bowls from the '60s, even pimento cheese/juice jars
from the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   For boomers, it's the call of the child. Or at least the
children they used to be. Buying a classic Fire-King custard cup is
like buying a little piece of their childhood, chocolate pudding
and all.
</P>
<P>
   On any given weekend, you can scour glass shows, antiques malls
and flea markets for these evocative items. They're especially hot
this time of year, thanks to holiday gift-giving and entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the attraction is their affordability. Some rare pieces
cost several thousand dollars, but it's possible to begin building
a collection with a $15 cup and saucer in Fire-King's Jade-ite.
</P>
<P>
   But hurry. The stuff, especially anything Fire-King, is so
sought after that even the nation's top glass expert has trouble
keeping up with its popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything take off or its price go up as fast
as Fire-King,'' says Gene Florence, author of 65 collecting books,
including ``Anchor Hocking's Fire-King &AMP; More'' (Collector Books,
$24.95). ``I sold a Fire-King Jade-ite ball pitcher in '97 for
$125, another in February for $250.''
</P>
<P>
   Today they sell for $550 to $600.
</P>
<P>
   Until a few years ago, kitchen glassware was considered cheap,
even ugly, garage-sale fodder. Glass elitists still question its
merits. But a pristine set of oven-safe Pyrex casseroles is as
coveted by boomer glass fanatics as a Rembrandt is by art
collectors. Maybe more. After all, you can't pop a Rembrandt in the
oven, nor does it remind you of those great chocolate chip cookies
your mom used to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``People stand in my booth and say, `Ooooh, my mother had this
and my grandmother had that.' It reminds them of family and home,''
says Jo Henson, 52. She and husband Ronnie, 53, began amassing
Fire-King four years ago and now sell it at three metro Atlanta
antiques malls.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a large part of the appeal of kitchen glassware is
familiarity. Almost everyone has a few vintage pieces in their
kitchen cabinets, even if it's just a chipped Pyrex measuring cup.
</P>
<P>
   Add in the official seal of housekeeping diva Martha Stewart,
who featured her daughter Alexis' massive Fire-King Jade-ite
collection in Martha Stewart Living magazine, and _ boom! _ instant
feeding frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martha personally shoved Jade-ite off the shelves,'' says
Terry Kovel who with husband Ralph writes antiques and collectibles
guides and a syndicated collecting column.
</P>
<P>
   Kovel credits Stewart for recognizing that a single piece of
anything is unimpressive. But, says Kovel, ``If you put together a
collection of almost anything, it fascinates people.'' Alexis'
Fire-King collection more than fascinated people, it was the
equivalent of Stewart saying, ``Beat this!''
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen glass enthusiasts view the Stewart Fire-King article as
a watershed event, forever splitting them into two groups:
pre-Martha collectors who began acquiring Fire-King a decade ago,
and post-Martha collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-Marthas credit Stewart for bringing respectability to their
collections. ``The Depression glass people used to laugh at my
Fire-King. But who's laughing now?'' jokes Shirley Moore of Tulsa,
Okla. But they also take Stewart to task for making it scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deeply resent what she did to my glass,'' sighs Beckye
Richardson, 42, of Flower Mound, Texas, one of the nation's top
five Fire-King collectors. ``It's really hard to find now. And the
prices!''
</P>
<P>
   But like other die-hard ``dish people,'' as collectors are wont
to call themselves, she admits that part of the excitement of
collecting Fire-King and other glassware is not being able to find
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still pieces I haven't seen except in a book,'' says
Peter Hamilton, 33, an Atlanta graphic designer. ``But it's fun to
look for it and find the bargains.

 &HT;    A therapeutic laying on of hands
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Always wanted a professional massage but too
intimidated/shy/uncertain how to get one? Not sure how to separate
the lotion-potion parlors from the legitimate, trained massage
therapists?
</P>
<P>
   One way is to check with Atlanta's schools of massage. They can
refer you to graduates or sign you up for student clinics where
hourlong massages are about $30, half the going rate of standard
therapeutic massage sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an excellent way for someone who's never had a massage to
come in and get one at one of the schools,'' said Sandy Jones,
director of admissions at New Life Institute School of Massage
Excellence in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, students at the clinics have completed their training
in basic technique and need practice perfecting their healing
touch. A bonus may include an instructor stepping in to demonstrate
so your muscles get a double dose of strokes and kneading out of
knots.
</P>
<P>
   The therapist you choose should be certified, meaning he has
attended an approved school of massage. In Georgia, the minimum
amount of hours for certification is 500. The state does not
require massage therapists to have a business or professional
license as many other states do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone could hang out their shingle, which is one of the
unfortunate aspects of massage in Georgia,'' said Maureen Marcus,
massage therapist in charge of staff training at Natural Body Spa
in Atlanta. One advantage of signing up for a massage through a spa
or health club is that they only hire certified therapists, Marcus
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asking friends is another way to find a trustworthy therapist.
``Referrals is basically how I built my business,'' said Barry
Guthrie, who specializes in deep-tissue massage at his Stone
Mountain, Ga., home studio. Guthrie, who began private practice
four years ago, said he did encounter the stigma the word
``massage'' sometimes elicits. ``Some people out there are still
not that educated about massage, so a big part of being a massage
therapist is to educate people.''
</P>
<P>
   At spas and health clubs, therapists say business booms during
the holidays as the working crowd has time off to luxuriate, and
many need a break from family gatherings and shopping till they
dropp. Massage gift certificates also make great stocking stuffers.
</P>
<P>
   Or if you're looking for a treat to give yourself during holiday
stress-out, have the massage therapist come to you.
</P>
<P>
   Many therapists in private practice such as Rebecca Thurman of
Atlanta will show up at your door with table, oil and music in
hand. The cost? Around $80 to $85.
</P>
<P>
   ``House calls are popular with some people,'' Thurman said.
``They don't want to fight the Atlanta traffic and afterward, they
can just take a shower or fall asleep in their own bed.''

 &HT;    Survivng holdiay shopping
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Throughout November, the focus has been
Thanksgiving _ planning and execution. Who's coming for dinner? Who
isn't (thank goodness)? Where is the family recipe for chiffon
pumpkin pie? Which in-law is the most boorish? Today, get with the
gift-giving program in a climate-controlled setting.
</P>
<P>
   The day after Thanksgiving is the starting gun for those of us
who honor each holiday in its appropriate calendar month and muddle
through life _ quite nicely, thank you _ without a
Daytimerdayplanner. Start your purchasing engines, Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What if you just can't face the crowds?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you have survived DisneyworldDisney World in July andor
Six Flags Over Texas in August, any mall or shopping center should
be a snap. You gave your all yesterday on that turkey dinner thing;
today is your day.Q: Isn't everyone else marching to the mall
today?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure they are, but you have the edge. Attack shopping like
you would a jam-packed theme park _ go prepared and follow basic
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Arrive early _ before posted store hours. You get your pick of
parking places and have a moment to review your assault plan.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the mall or shopping center in a clockwise direction _ the
majority will follow a counterclockwise pattern.
</P>
<P>
   When given a choice (of registers, lines, whatever) pick the one
on the left _ the line to the right is favored by most.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the store farthest from your car first and work your way
back to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Plan any meals at odd times _ have an early snack or a very late
lunch.Q: Don't I have a million other holiday chores to do?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but not on this unofficial national shopping holiday.
Put off other tasks that can be accomplished later.
</P>
<P>
   Buy stamps from the post machines in off hours. Begin saving the
comics to use for wrapping paper and raffia from flower bouquets
for ribbon. Forget about merry mavens who spend the afternoon
gold-leafing apples and dipping magnolia leaves in glycerin.
</P>
<P>
   Let the catalogs cool until the children are nestled all snug in
their beds, and address Christmas cards when you have the kitchen
table to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What family tree spawned the Mall of America?
</P>
<P>
   A: The shopping center has come a long way from its humble
roots. According to the New York Public Library reference desk, the
first urban shopping center was built in Baltimore, 1896; the first
suburban one in 1928 in Ardmore, Pa. This little center contained a
movie theater, two department stores, medical offices and 17 (count
'em) other shops.Q: Is it better to give than to receive if you
can't find the right gift?
</P>
<P>
   A: Do not waste time on hard-to-buy-forfind people today.
</P>
<P>
   Underbuy: A simple present can always can be augmented later.
</P>
<P>
   Consider gift ideas for groups: All sisters-in-law receive a
sweater; all teachers, a pen; all brothers, a soccer shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Donations make a great gift and are very much appreciated. Gift
certificates (to the movies, to a swanky grocery store) are fun and
flexible. Pick up several little gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Make a basket with wrapped gifts (presentation, presentation,
presentation) for the children to share with their friends.
</P>
<P>
   Insist that store clerks honor the customer in front of them
rather than the one on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Ask for free wrapping (take it with you) _ gift boxes, tissue
paper, anything to make your wrapping life easier.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to mail a gift, have the address written on an index
card to hand the clerk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the basics for storming the consumer's castle and
making the most of the day?
</P>
<P>
   A: Clear the decks.
</P>
<P>
   Remove every extra item from your purse to lighten the load.
Ditch the matchbox cars, the room-mother ``to call'' list and the
lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Plan to pick up take-out on the way home. No cooking, no
cleaning today.
</P>
<P>
   Make a list on an envelope (name, gift idea, price range). Use
it to store the receipts from today's purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Give yourself permission to meet a friend for coffee or lunch,
but don't shop with a friend _ it is distracting and
time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Check out what you have on hand _ any gifts you may have
purchased and hidden _ before you hit the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Dress appropriately: Dust off the walking shoes, don a comfy
sweater with pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Do without a coat if you can _ it just bogs you down.
</P>
<P>
   Do not be distracted by the perfect New Year's Eve dress or a
pair of shoes. Resist any temptation to head to a dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You load 16 tons and whaddaya get ... ?A: A backache.
</P>
<P>
   The lighter and the more centrally located on your body the
package or purse you carry, the better, says Dr. Randall Dryer of
the Central Texas Spine Institute. Try shifting your purse from one
shoulder to the other and carry it more toward the back of your
body than the front. (Safety dictates keeping your purse where you
can see it, though.)
</P>
<P>
   Lugging heavy packages and/or children in and out of the car and
the house can cause physical problems. ``Do not lift and reach,''
notes Dryer, as the shoulders should be in line with the hips when
lifting.
</P>
<P>
   Constant weight and improper lifting may cause some temporary
aches and pains that can be corrected with a change in posture or
habits as well as strengthening exercises.Q: Didn't Mama say
there'd be days like this?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Is the card still in your possession, and can you verify
the last three charges?''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if you receive a call from your credit card
company after a day of heating plastic to the melting point. Judy
Miller of Chase Manhattan Bank says an early detection system
protects customers from the fraudulent use of their credit cards.
This electronic system looks at all card transactions and flags
unusual spending activity. Trained representatives review account
information to determine who should receive a follow-up phone call
to verify the account activity.
</P>
<P>
   Safe shopping
</P>
<P>
   The International Council of Shopping Centers advises shoppers
to remember the holiday season is the November sweeps for thieves.
So heed these tenets to keep you and your treasures safe:
</P>
<P>
   Remember where you are: Do not exit a store or mall uttering,
``Where did I park my car?'' Carry your keys in your hand.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be a target. Do not leave packages in plain sight on the
seat of the car. Lock your vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When possible, walk to the parking lot with someone else (a
security guard or a friend who meets you at a prearranged time
inside the store).
</P>
<P>
   Glance in the back seat before you hop in. Avoid parking near a
large van that may obscure your view or contain a band of thieves
(easier said than done in Suburban country.)
</P>
<P>
   Be alert. Do not flash wads of cash or stacks of credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know?
</P>
<P>
   _ Nordstrom is the only store I've heard of that turns its space
into Christmas overnight on Thanksgiving. No September Santas, no
October twinkle lights. Amen!
</P>
<P>
   Surviving holiday spending
</P>
<P>
   The holidays allow us all to be someone's fairy godmother _
don't let the ``someone'' be a credit card company. Enjoy the
thrill of giving and thinking about those on your list without the
guilt and interest rates. Here are some tips from the Consumer
Credit Counseling Service to help you.
</P>
<P>
   Plan ahead by saving money for the holidays (sage advice, but it
may be too late for this year).
</P>
<P>
   Split the cost of large gifts with someone.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a gift for an entire family instead of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Mail gifts early to avoid overnight charges.
</P>
<P>
   Walk around a store with a purchases to give you timea moment to
reflect on it.
</P>
<P>
   Pay with cash _ it is harder to spend cash than to use credit.
</P>
<P>
   Overspender's Punch Recipe: Cut top off a one-gallon milk carton
and fill with water. Add all credit cards. Place in deep freeze
until January. Thaw and serve warm with New Year's resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   For a free copy of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service
brochure ``Surviving the Holidays,'' call CCCS, a program of
LifeWorks, at 447-0711.
</P>
<P>
   Personal shoppers
</P>
<P>
   If making a list and checking it twice is making you a basket
case, then it's time for ``your people to call someone else's
people.'' Personal shoppers are veritable life savers for those
with long lists, impossible lists or lists of people you do not
really know. These wish-list wizards will consult with you,
suggest, select and shop for anyone. Need it mailed? No problem.
Need it delivered? Can do.
</P>
<P>
   Of course this type of service is a luxury (ask for prices), but
think of it as a gift to yourself _ and to your family. Cheaper
than therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise, surprise, surprise
</P>
<P>
   Black Friday, the shopping center industry name for the day
after Thanksgiving, is not the busiest shopping day of the year.
Its rank, according to the International Council of Shopping
Centers, is consistently below that of the Saturday before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Another holiday note: An average of 11,620 children per shopping
mall visited Santa in 1997 while listening to the two most popular
mall holiday songs _ ``Jingle Bells'' and ``White Christmas.''

 (ATTN: S.C., Del.)  (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a box in the stands at the small, handsome Springdale Race
Course in Camden, S.C., last Sunday afternoon, a sweet, sunny day,
Beasie Patterson, was watching her daughter, Bitsy, ride Raptor in
an early steeplechase race, a prelude to the big race later in the
day. Bitsy would ride Flat Top, a candidate for the Eclipse Award
as steeplechasing's horse of the year, in the $100,000 Marion
duPont Scott Colonial Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect day for racing,'' recalled Beasie. There was
a crowd of about 12,000, including the tailgaters picnicking in the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   Beasie, in her black pants suit, was enjoying the race, though
always with a sense of danger lurking in the back of her mind.
</P>
<P>
   She had been in the sport long enough, she had said, to know
that something terrible could happen. Her husband, Duncan, had
ridden for 20 years and sustained an assortment of relatively minor
injuries, and then Bitsy had taken up the sport in 1992, when
Duncan hung up his competitive reins. Bitsy had sustained two
concussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``And broken her nose _ oh, dozens of times,'' Beasie said.
</P>
<P>
   As for that fear of serious injury, well, said Beasie, ``You try
not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bitsy, who had turned 28 a week earlier, and at 5 feet 6 inches
and 120 pounds with strong hands and smiling blue eyes that hid an
intensely competitive spirit, had now emerged as one of the leading
riders in the sport, having won the Grade II Ferguson Memorial at
Colonial Downs and the Grade I Breeders' Cup Grand National at Far
Hills, N.J., in October. Listed as an amateur rider, she has
nonetheless tallied $167,980 in prize money this year.
</P>
<P>
   Beasie watched Bitsy, a blonde pony tail escaping from her
fiberglass helmet, her torso bent forward in the Kelly green riding
silks, lead Raptor over the next-to-last fence. Suddenly the
horse's front hooves caught on the hedge, and Raptor and Bitsy
toppled over.
</P>
<P>
   Beasie tensed in the stands. ``I couldn't see her or the horse
because the hedge covered my view,'' she said. ``I waited for her
to get up. And then I saw three men running toward them and I heard
a siren and saw an ambulance speeding toward my daughter. I said,
`Oh, God, she's not getting up!' And I started running.''
</P>
<P>
   The men from the trauma unit were working on Bitsy as her mother
arrived. Within minutes, Bitsy was in the ambulance and taken to a
nearby helicopter, which took Bitsy to the Richland Memorial
Hospital in Columbia, S.C. Her mother, not allowed to accompany her
daughter in the small helicopter _ Bitsy was having trouble
breathing and the paramedics needed the small space _ was driven to
the hospital, some 30 minutes away by car, 16 minutes by
helicopter. Raptor had broken a leg and was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Patterson arrived in the emergency ward, she was told,
``It's very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   An important sign, the dilation of Bitsy's eyes, was not equal.
But in the matter of a head injury, the first 48 hours are most
important. Bitsy had remained unconscious since the fall. She was
now put on a respirator. There was no skull fracture, but there had
been bleeding inside the head.
</P>
<P>
   Her life, if not her well-being, were at stake. Her condition,
the hospital reported, was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``No surgery is required,'' Dr. William Rambo, head of the
neurological division of the hospital, told Beasie. ``All we can do
is watch her and hope for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasie _ her given name, Beatrice, is the same as her daughter's
_ phoned her husband in Miami, where he had gone on to watch their
other daughter, Jennifer, 18, play in a national field hockey
tournament. Duncan Patterson, with his brother, Chris, runs a
family real-estate business in their hometown of Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, the rest of the family flew to Bitsy's bedside, and the
Pattersons have spent all week in the family room outside the
intensive care unit. On Thanksgiving Day, Beasie said, one of the
things they were thankful for was Bitsy's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bitsy hadn't been wearing it,'' she said, ``the injury
would have been even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambo said Bitsy's injury was nothing like that of Christopher
Reeve's, the actor who fractured his spinal column after a spill in
a show-jumping accident and is a quadriplegic. ``That's a whole
different ball game,'' he said.

   Horse-riding injuries are hardly uncommon and occur in a wide
range of riding sports, from flat racing to casual weekend
trotters. Steeplechasing is a sport generally related to the
well-heeled, and the Pattersons are apparently of that world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bitsy loves the sport, loves animals, and has had experience
in riding from an early age,'' said her mother. ``From pony races
when she was smaller, to fox hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she was taken off the respirator, but when she had
trouble breathing, was put back on it. On Wednesday, for the first
time, Bitsy's eyes began to dilate symmetrically. And she seems to
be coming slowly to semiconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``She followed some commands to move her hand and her feet,''
Rambo said. ``I call her state a light coma.''
</P>
<P>
   A case of pneumonia, he said, had ``complicated matters.'' But
her condition has been upgraded from critical to serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell for sure how she's going to come out of
this,'' Rambo said. ``At this point, though, we're cautiously
optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the respirator had been removed from her throat and
Patterson, though still unconscious, responded to a nurse asking
her, ``Are you feeling better?''
</P>
<P>
   Beasie, who was at her daughter's bedside, said Bitsy nodded her
head yes. ``She's still in a fog,'' Beasie recalled, ``but she
responded. It was very exciting. Very exciting.''

   CURRIE _ The next era in space exploration is set to begin Dec.
3, and a former Troy, Ohio resident _ astronaut Nancy Currie _ will
play a key role. On Dec. 3, Currie and her crewmates will blast off
on space shuttle Discovery to begin the biggest space construction
project in history, the International Space Station. Hailed as the
next step in human space exploration and denounced as a boondoggle,
the station will be bigger than a football field and house up to
seven astronauts for months at a time when it is completed about
six years from now. Since announced by President Reagan in 1984,
the program has been plagued by cost overruns, delays and
redesigns. The biggest problem now is Russia's economic crisis.
Russia is responsible for major parts of the station, but its work
is underfunded and behind schedule. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News).

SPORTS COLUMN: SEIZING CONTROL, EVEN IN HARTFORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, Robert Kraft, Billie Jean King and Martin
Jacobson tucked into full plates last week. Whether or not we join
them in giving thanks is irrelevant; we don't sit at their tables.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner was the big turkey, as usual. He's Code Blue
wherever he goes, a walking car alarm, suddenly looking fuzzier
compared to Charles F. Dolan, the Cablevision mogul, who may or may
not buy the Yankees and hire Steinbrenner to run all the New York
sports teams. Who would be surprised if the deal is dead because
the Boss was too pushy? The image of Steinbrenner trundling out on
the ice to show Wayne Gretzky how to get physical makes my knees
freeze, so imagine what it does to the stealthy Chuck.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan wants the Yankees for the same reason that television
networks want to own their hit shows. It keeps costs way down. This
excuse is less endearing than wanting to own sports teams so you
can strut around town, throw luxury sky-box bashes and harangue big
guys while they are showering.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft may be able to do all those things in Hartford, a
city that seemed more amused than ecstatic last weekend when it
seemed as though the New England Patriots had chosen it over
Boston. After all, people in Massachusetts still call people in
Connecticut ``swamp Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bostonians must know something, since they originally sent
the Patriots packing to Foxboro.
</P>
<P>
   The lively mayor of Hartford, Michael Peters, quickly dismissed
my questions about the importance of a football team to a city that
had lost much of its claim to fame, the insurance industry, and was
in danger of even losing its ballet company for lack of support.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots would merely be ``part of the chemistry of our
comeback,'' he said, ``opening a PR window for the city.''
</P>
<P>
   He reminded me that Hartford had the Rage of the American
Basketball League and that the University of Connecticut's
nationally famous teams would be playing in any new Hartford
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Peters is right on, of course. In the Expansion Era, a pro team
can no longer bestow major league status on a city merely by moving
in. But if every other whistle stop has a franchise, you look low
rent without one. On the other hand, a great college franchise may
be a better bet. When was the last time a university left town
because the owner wanted sky-box, food and parking concessions?
</P>
<P>
   This was on the eve of Billie Jean's 55th birthday last Monday,
at a party to celebrate the 25th anniversary of her victory over
55-year-old Bobby Riggs in ``The Battle of the Sexes,'' a silly
event that only helped change the course of history. It was the
Boston Tea Party of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Billie Jean's symbolic importance to the passing century is
enormous, but her playful vision was again on display in a
delicious series of doubles matches that included Martina,
Chrissie, Tracy, Rosie, Zina Garrison, Ilana Kloss and the Wendys,
Turnbull and Overton. Most of them are in their 40s and better than
ever to watch as they mugged, bantered with the audience and stood
at the net hammering volleys with amazing ferocity and reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   This was Billie Jean's Legends Tour, giving the men's ATP
doubles championship a night off and proving that the humanity of
senior tennis is far more fun to watch than the technical
virtuosity of athletes who have only lived the game. The star was
Rosie Casals, un-self-consciously overweight, consciously
overwrought, the Cheech of women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   As wonderful a time as I had in Hartford, I did miss the
thrilling threepeat of the Martin Luther King Jr. High School boys
soccer team, whose third straight city title capped a third
straight season in which it has not lost a game _ on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Two of King's games were forfeited and Marty Jacobson, the
coach, was ``suspended indefinitely,'' for what seemed like a
combination of careless, if not arrogantly unmindful, paperwork,
and the pathetic pettiness of opposing coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The official charges were using an overage player and one made
ineligible by inadequate attendance. Despite the losses, King
plowed through the field, beating Roosevelt in the final for its
61st straight victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson's suspension was rescinded last week, thanks to an
alert and humane Schools Chancellor, Rudy Crew. But this tale
twists on; Roosevelt lodged a protest, charging that two of the
King stars, juniors from Nigeria, Bishop Dike and Henry Iwuchukwu,
are overage and academically ineligible. Jacobson maintains that
Iwuchukwu is 17 and Dike turned 18 last month. The school has been
scrambling to assemble visas, transcripts and birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   None of this would be happening if Steinbrenner added the Public
Schools Athletic League to his Yankee-Knick-Ranger portfolio. Who
better, this man who once coached Donna Shalala's schoolgirl
softball team (and well, she has said).
</P>
<P>
   I think the Boss owes the city some pro bono after it made him
world-famous.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine him strutting around lumpy high school fields, throwing
cafeteria bashes, haranguing whining, lazy, clock-watching coaches.
I'd give thanks for that any season.

SCHOOL FOR AMERICAN INDIANS IS BASED ON EASTERN PREPS 
</HEADLINE>

(mk) 
 By JANE SALODOF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred years ago, after the conquest of the West, American
Indian schools were founded to encourage assimilation and stamp out
indigenous culture. In the second half of this century, American
Indian schools took the opposite approach, emphasizing their
students' heritage. Neither approach fostered academic success.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one of the most unusual boarding schools in the country
marries both approaches. Modeled after East Coast boarding schools
that prepare students for Ivy League colleges, the Native American
Preparatory School in Rowe, N.M., prepares gifted Indian students,
most of whom grew up in poverty on reservations, to walk in two
worlds, tribal and academic. It will graduate its first class in
June, and has already drawn recruiters from more than 30 colleges,
including Harvard and Cornell.
</P>
<P>
   The school's curriculum includes American Indian perspectives;
half of its faculty members are Indian. When 17-year-old Warren
Honaberger of Espanola, N.M., studied American history, for
example, he read not only de Tocqueville but also speeches by
Indian leaders who influenced American democracy. A senior of
Pueblo Indian, German and Spanish descent, Warren wears a bracelet
he made in a Navajo silversmithing class and credits his classmates
with introducing him to the breadth of Indian cultures.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the best learning experience I've had,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To recruit students, the school had to overcome a seemingly
insurmountable hurdle, the anger and distrust of many American
Indians who remember boarding schools that routinely cut off
children's braids and forbade them from speaking their own
languages. The founder of a typical school, Capt. Richard Pratt of
the Carlisle Indian School, was quoted as advocating in 1892 that
such schools ``Kill the Indian in him, and save the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Native American Prep exists largely because of Richard Ettinger,
son of the founder of Prentice Hall, who was disappointed not to
find American Indian classmates at Dartmouth College in the 1940s.
He had read Dartmouth's charter, which makes a commitment to
American Indian education, and wanted to know why no Indians were
enrolled. To address the problem, he first financed college
scholarships, but became convinced the solution lay in high
schools. Native American Prep was founded in 1995 with 50 students;
Ettinger died of lymphoma a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the school has 74 students from 32 different American
Indian tribes and 11 states on a picturesque campus, formerly a
corporate retreat, in the Pecos River Valley. Though most American
Indians live in cities, the school recruits heavily on reservations
because gifted students there have fewer academic opportunities,
said the admissions director, Christopher Johnson, who is of
Saginaw, Chippewa and Russian Jewish descent.
</P>
<P>
   Creating an American Indian curriculum is not easy for a school
that must answer to parents from many tribes. ``It's not our
responsibility to teach these teens how to be native,'' said Sven
Husaby, the headmaster. ``That belongs to their families and
communities. But it is our responsibility to support their native
identities, to give a fuller understanding of the native world in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the many indigenous cultures in the nation, the
inter-tribal school is, in Husaby's words, ``almost like a Native
American United Nations,'' complete with prejudices among students
about other tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like Warren Honaberger, many students hail the diversity of
tribes as one of the most important components in their education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of hard to get along with each other, racist in some
ways,'' said Jamie Little Eagle, 15, of Rapid City, S.D., who is a
member of the Standing Rock Sioux nation. Jamie, a sophomore, wants
to be a physical therapist for the National Basketball Association.
``We have sweats here, and the Navajos join us, but the Pueblos are
all weird. People make fun of different ways, but it's cool because
I have friends from all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The school attracts what the former academic head, Clayton
Small, calls ``hero children'' _ youngsters driven to overcome the
widespread poverty and substance abuse on their reservations.
Small, a Northern Cheyenne whose doctorate is in educational
leadership, recognizes such children easily, because he was one.
``I thought if I did this masquerade dance in my family that they
would become normal. I became a workaholic, but no matter what I
achieved my family and my community was pretty sick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite pressure to hire an American Indian as headmaster to
succeed the founding headmaster, who is returning East to teach,
the board sought Husaby for his more traditional boarding school
background _ a 30-year career at the prestigious Putney School in
Vermont, the last five as headmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to confront some problems that every preparatory
school confronts,'' said Barbara Ettinger, the board president and
Richard Ettinger's daughter. ``It's important to have a headmaster
who has experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems cited by Ms. Ettinger and others are considerable.
The school needs to raise nearly $3 million annually, and as yet
has no rich alumni or parents. It has high academic standards, but
many of its students need remedial work to achieve them. The school
last year received 145 applications for 23 vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   In a rural area, the school had a telephone system that was
inadequate for administrative offices, classroom technology and
dormitory service even before it was knocked out by a lightning
bolt last summer. Last year especially, attrition was high: The
academics are hard, and some students find it painful to be away
from their families and tribal life.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the students are on scholarship. About 70 percent
pay the minimum of $900 for the year, based on the school's
estimate that a normal teen-ager would be eating $100 worth of food
a month at home. For a few, even that is waived.
</P>
<P>
   Academic preparation of American Indians is poor, with students
receiving the lowest scores in the country on standardized tests
like the SAT, where they average 950 out of 1600, according to the
school's guidance counselor, Whitney Laughlin. Of those who go on
to college, more than half drop out the first year; only 3 percent
finish their degrees.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, though everyone enters with at least a B average,
many come with spotty preparation, particularly in math. Husaby is
hiring an extra math teacher as part of his first-year program to
strengthen the academic program so that everyone will be ready for
college; to professionalize operations, and to promote the school's
long-term financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   The school is aggressive about sending students out for
experiences with the non-native world: a semester in China, a year
in Spain, a trip to a poetry workshop at Kenyon College in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want their first time as a minority to be when they go
to college,'' said the college counselor, Whitney Laughlin.

PATRIOTS OWNER WAS PULLED ONE WAY AS BUSINESSMAN, ANOTHER AS FAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.)  (js) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The occasion called for Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, had just
agreed to move his football team from Massachusetts to Connecticut.
The governor there was promising to build him a $350-million
stadium in Hartford, to guarantee up to $17.5 million a year in
sales of luxury seats, to let him keep all stadium profits without
paying any rent, even to pick up the tab for the insurance. All in
all, the experts said, it was one of the richest stadium deals any
sports mogul had negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   But last Sunday, Kraft wasn't celebrating. In full-page
advertisements in the Boston newspapers, Kraft offered a 1,400-word
apology. ``Make no mistake,'' he wrote. ``This decision was not
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft doesn't just want Connecticut's money. He wants to be
forgiven for taking it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other sports team owner in America, Kraft,
57, embodies the opposing impulses _ one economic, the other
emotional _ that are throwing dozens of cities into spasms of
subsidized stadium construction and leaving others, deserted by
their teams, perhaps wishing they had.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his peers, particularly in the National Football
League, Kraft sought the greater revenues that a new stadium would
bring from expanded luxury seating, concessions and advertising.
But unlike many of them, Kraft, a native of Boston and loyal season
ticketholder before he bought the team, resisted using threats to
leave his home state as a ploy in the negotiations with
Massachusetts, even as the talks about the state's contribution for
a new stadium grew increasingly bitter.
</P>
<P>
   When he finally acted, it was after five years of struggle with
a state legislature whose leaders came to consider him little more
than a ``whiny millionaire'' who simply wanted too big of a
government handout.
</P>
<P>
   In its deal with Kraft, Hartford is buying more than just a
competitive NFL team and a palatial new sports complex: In Kraft,
the Connecticut capital is getting someone who is described as a
ruthless businessman but who also requires his players to make 10
appearances a season at local charities and civic groups. He's a
man who also pays for parks in Israel, library wings in Worcester,
and writes half-million-dollar checks to his own favorite causes,
from the Boys and Girls Clubs of Boston to cancer research and
domestic-violence prevention.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, Hartford's newest corporate citizen is a team
owner who is deeply and openly emotional about his relationship
with Patriots fans: Two seasons ago, as the team's fortunes soared
with a trip to the Super Bowl, that bond became an out-and-out
lovefest. Before home games, Kraft would cruise through the parking
lots outside suburban Foxboro Stadium in a golf cart, high-fiving
tailgaters, unashamedly reveling in their affection. And each time
the Patriots scored, he would wave down from his luxury suite above
the 50-yard line, and the crowd would roar back.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed in the past week.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19, hours after he announced his deal in Hartford, a
photograph of the absent Kraft was flashed on a banquet hall screen
as the American Ireland Fund honored its largest contributors. The
black-tie crowd of 1,500 booed loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday night, there were few signs of rancor at Foxboro
during the Patriots' game against the Miami Dolphins, suggesting
that Patriot fans viewed his decision less harshly than the
columnists and radio hosts who had demonized him. But Kraft skipped
the golf-cart ride nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he'll be ostracized,'' said Stephen Tocco, the
president of a Boston consulting firm who worked closely with Kraft
as a top aide to former Gov. William Weld, one of Kraft's key
allies in trying to get a new stadium. ``But he won't be signing
many autographs any more. His worst moment is going to be the day
the trucks leave. But he's got three years to get ready for that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft declined repeated requests for an interview. His son,
Jonathan, the Patriots' vice president, explained that more
publicity could only jeopardize legislative approval of the stadium
deal in Hartford: ``We want to stay underground for now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Kraft has learned from his battles in Boston. He was
often criticized for lashing out at his allies when they failed him
almost as much as his opponents when they rebuffed him. But beneath
the surface were old Boston tensions seldom discussed openly.
``This town is not impressed with new money,'' said one longtime
supporter, trying to explain Kraft's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including people who know him well, said there was a
deeper source to the vehemence of opposition to his proposals,
suggesting that although Kraft, who is Jewish, saw himself as a
second-generation Bostonian, to the Irish, Italian and Brahmin
insiders with whom he was dealing he remained an outsider, first

   Kraft spent over a year on an ill-fated plan for a stadium in
South Boston _ an insular, predominantly Irish neighborhood
notorious for its battles against school busing in the 1970s.
Residents, perceiving that he was trying to ram the project down
their throats, rebelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's anti-Semitism, or anti-Kraftism, or
anti-footballism, but it's really strange,'' Jonathan Kraft told
The Boston Globe in February 1997, trying to account for the enmity
his father had stirred up in South Boston. ``I just don't get it.''

</P>
<P>
   Robert Kraft's love of sports began young, but was frustrated
early on. He grew up in Brookline, a few blocks from the old Braves
Field, where he sold programs until the baseball team moved to
Milwaukee in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   His father was a dry-goods merchant who was better known as a
lay leader at an Orthodox synagogue. But the family's religious
observance interfered with the teen-ager's desire to play high
school sports, with games on Saturday. He played football for the
first time as an undergraduate at Columbia University, excelling in
an intercollegiate league for lightweight athletes.
</P>
<P>
   After Harvard Business School he married Myra Hiatt, the
daughter of a wealthy Worcester manufacturer, and soon went to work
for his father-in-law. In 1972, the year he first bought season
tickets to the Patriots, Kraft, then 31, took control of his
father-in-law's packaging corporation, Rand-Whitney, and launched
International Forest Products, which trades in raw materials around
the world. Today, the two comprise the largest privately owned
packaging company in the country and the biggest but least-noticed
divisions of the Kraft Group, which generates an estimated $500
million a year in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, outside the Boston charity-dinner circuit, Kraft was still
virtually unknown when he bought the Patriots in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It was not his first venture into professional sports; he had
owned the Boston Lobsters, a World Team Tennis franchise, until
that league folded in 1978. Later, he made passes at the Red Sox
and Celtics, and twice tried unsuccessfully to buy the Patriots,
before seizing on an alternate route to control of the team _
becoming its landlord. In 1988, he and a Massachusetts shopping
mall developer, Stephen Karp, bought Foxboro Stadium, the Patriots'
current home 30 miles south of Boston, at a bankruptcy sale for $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Kraft, fresh from buying out Karp's interest in
the stadium, used his control of the Patriots' lease to edge out
several rival bidders for the team. The closest competition came
from a St. Louis businessman who offered $200 million and would
have moved the team there. Kraft paid only $158 million, because he
threatened a costly legal battle if another buyer tried to break
the Foxboro lease.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was far more than he wanted to pay,'' said Tocco. ``But
he really believes in Boston and Massachusetts, and the Patriots
looked like they were leaving. He felt he was doing it as much as a
public service as a business deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was hailed as the team's savior. And he cultivated the
image of a fan's fan, recalling in interviews how he and his sons
had endured the lean years alongside blue-collar Patriots fans and
wanted nothing more as owners than to bring a championship home to
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, however, Kraft began pushing for a new
stadium to replace Foxboro.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kraft brought his business acumen and his history as
a football fan to bear in his dealings with other NFL owners,
earning respect as a consensus builder.
</P>
<P>
   And as his peers in the NFL accepted publicly financed stadiums
_ like Art Modell, who moved his Cleveland franchise to Baltimore
in exchange for a new ball park _ Kraft, who was willing to raise
the money for a stadium privately, would complain to friends and
associates about the ingratitude of Massachusetts politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was willing to spend hundreds of millions of my own money to
privately finance a stadium,'' he wrote in the newspaper
advertisement last Sunday, ``but was never given the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   His stadium hunt degenerated in Boston beginning in late 1995,
after the Massachusetts House rejected a proposed domed stadium and
convention center complex. Kraft came up with a plan to build a
downtown, open-air stadium without public subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan, which relied on one-time fees charged to season
ticketholders, was overshadowed by a series of political missteps
that left even Kraft's supporters bemoaning his political naivete
and his tendency to ignore advice and to turn on his allies. At one
point, for example, he claimed that the governor at the time,
William F. Weld, had guaranteed to deliver him a new stadium,
saying that promise had ``induced'' him to take the risk of buying
the Patriots. Yet a seventh grader could have told Kraft that such
a promise was meaningless without the cooperation of the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In trying for over a year to build a stadium in South Boston,
associates of Kraft said he made the mistake of believing that if
he could persuade the community's political leaders to accept his
plan, residents would follow. But residents bridled at that
presumption, as much as at the notion of game-day traffic jams in
their neighborhood. The South Boston plan went down in flames and
ill will in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Kraft had often expressed a wish that a deal
could be struck if he got the most powerful politicians all in one
room. In Connecticut, he was proved right. After a series of
secret, face-to-face meetings with Gov. John Rowland that began in
May, the two reached agreement over the weekend of Nov. 14 and 15.
That Monday, Rowland met with all six legislative leaders to gain
their support, and Kraft came by to answer lawmakers' questions.
</P>
<P>
   His deal with Connecticut in hand, Kraft immediately set out to
persuade fans that he had done right by them. In a letter to season
ticketholders mailed Nov. 19, he noted that they would not have to
pay extra fees to retain their seats in Hartford, vowed there would
be room at the new stadium for tailgating, and even promised that
the new parking lots would empty in less than an hour, a vast
improvement over Foxboro.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not enough for Kraft: On Sunday, in his newspaper
ads, he defended the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Massachusetts'' he wrote. ``It has been home to my
family all our lives. I wanted nothing more than to keep the
Patriots here. It was simply impossible to do so and fulfill my
obligation to continue to put a championship-caliber team on the
field.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Record warmth is expected Sunday from the central Plains to the
Atlantic Seaboard. High pressure centered over the Southeast will
circulate very mild air from the southwest into the East. Readings
will rise 15 to 30 degrees above seasonal levels from Kansas to the
Middle Atlantic coast. Sunshine will prevail east of the lower
Mississippi Valley and as far north as Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian air mass will keep central and northern New England
seasonal as clouds lower and thicken ahead of a warm front. There
will be a few showers inland late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture will stream out of the western Gulf into the southern
Plains and central Mississippi Valley. Morning fog will be common
in this area with scattered showers developing by afternoon. Low
pressure over Minnesota will summon the moisture into the western
Great Lakes with widespread clouds and patches of rain, especially
north of the warm front.
</P>
<P>
   A chillier air mass will push eastward from the Rockies into the
northwest Plains. Mixed rain and snow are likely in the western
Dakotas with periods of wet snow in the higher elevations of
eastern Utah. A disturbance over the southern Rockies will trigger
some showers and gusty winds. A few thunderstorms should erupt
Sunday night in western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   More tranquil conditions are expected in southern California and
parts of Nevada. Another front will reach the Northwest with heavy
rain and increasing wind west of the Cascades. Snow levels will get
lower in the mountains while a few showers dampen the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Second Summer
</P>
<P>
   During the latter part of autumn, a second summer often comes.
Indian summer is the name given to a late autumn period of
abnormally warm weather accompanied by sunny, hazy days and cool
nights. While there is no official definition, a killing frost must
precede the warm spell in order for it to be considered true Indian
summer. The origin of the term most likely relates to the way
American Indians used these last mild days to increase their winter
stores. For the next few days, a spell of Indian summer with near
record warmth will envelop most of the eastern half of the nation.

HIKERS AND HORSE PACKERS COMPETE FOR WILDERNESS

   BISHOP, Calif. _ Horse packers blazed many of the trails that
pierce the dense pine forests of the Sierra backcountry, and since
early this century they have been carrying sightseers and fishermen
into the range's high reaches.
</P>
<P>
   But now packers are locked in a dispute with hikers and
environmentalists over their access to some of California's best
known wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   It may still be trail etiquette for hikers to step aside for
horses, but backpackers increasingly complain that there are too
many commercial pack trains in the wilderness areas and that
livestock is damaging the high-elevation terrain.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, packers say, some hikers have begun harassing
them, throwing rocks at mules, untying stock animals in backcountry
areas and one time stretching barbed wire across a mountain route.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my best horses got tangled up in it,'' said Bill
Draves, owner of the Rainbow Pack Station near Bishop. ``How long
does a person want to deal with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Then late last year the U.S. Forest Service released the draft
of a management plan for four popular wilderness areas in the
central Sierra: the John Muir next to Mount Whitney, the Ansel
Adams, the Dinkey Lakes and the Monarch. The plan included
restrictions on commercial horse packers that the packers said
would force them to raise rates or go out of business. The response
of hiker and environmental groups, though, was that the plan did
not restrict packers enough.
</P>
<P>
   At its heart, it is a cultural clash between the traditional
values of the cowboy-style packers, who operate more than two dozen
pack stations in the area, and the low-impact philosophies of
environmentalists and backpackers, who have become more organized
in the area as backpackers, rather than horse packers, have come to
dominate use of the wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Suk, spokesman for the High Sierra Hikers Association, which
formed in 1991, said that horse packers harmed backcountry areas by
overgrazing, taking pack animals into the mountains when the ground
is still wet from melting snow, and other practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impacts of stock use in fragile alpine and subalpine areas
has been well documented,'' Suk said. ``Some of the commercial
packers show a lot of care for the land back there, but some of
them don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Horse packers insist that they do not harm the backcountry areas
where they have operated for decades. ``It's not a case that this
stuff wears out or is destroyed,'' said Bob Tanner, who has owned
two pack stations in the Sierra since 1960. ``That's a huge
misunderstanding. You stay in business for 40 years, you sure don't
want to go out and do damage to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service regulates access to the wilderness areas by
both backpackers and commercial horse packers, but the hikers
accuse the Forest Service of monitoring them much more closely than
horse packers. Hikers who camp overnight must obtain a backcountry
permit through a phone reservation system or at a ranger station,
and campers without a permit are fined.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the packers, in contrast, is allowed a set number of
days to operate in a wilderness, but can determine which days and
the size of the party, up to 15 people and 25 horses and mules (a
typical group, packers say, is eight people with 15 head of stock).
But critics say their permits are not monitored and enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Horse packers figure prominently in the history of the Sierra
and the identity of its mountain communities. Several Sierra pack
station owners have held important county offices, and one, Ike
Livermore, was director of California's resources agency when
Ronald Reagan was governor. But their critics contend that over the
years the outfitters used their political pull to escape regulation
by the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   Concern about the Sierra wilderness plan has been so great that
agency officials extended the comment period and received an
estimated 2,000 comments. Although the Forest Service spent seven
years developing the plan, almost everyone with an interest in the
wilderness areas has panned the document, calling it arbitrary,
ineffectual and bureaucratically obscure.
</P>
<P>
   The wilderness coordinator of the Inyo National Forest, Mary
Beth Hennessy, conceded, ``The plan is inherently confusing about
what we're trying to accomplish here.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The complex of adjacent wilderness areas covered by the plan
stretches into three national forests and includes more than
885,000 acres of spectacular landscapes lying between Yosemite and
Sequoia/Kings Canyon national parks. One, the John Muir Wilderness,
a more than 580,000-acre site that includes the popular Mount
Whitney trail, receives the second heaviest use of any Forest
Service wilderness area.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes between horsemen and backpackers have erupted in other
parts of the country, including the Sawtooth National Recreation
Area in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just went through a revision of our wilderness plan, and we
had quite a row,'' said a Sawtooth wilderness ranger, Ed Cannady.
``The single biggest complaint we get from users of the backcountry
is from backpackers about stock use.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the packers here believe that the unstated goal of at
least some local Forest Service personnel is to end all stock use
in the Sierra wildernesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't come right out and say they want to eliminate it,''
said Larry Knapp, owner of the Yosemite Trails Pack Station.
``Instead of doing that, they've slowly manipulated the system and
closed different areas and meadows.''

FACING A POTENTIAL SHORTAGE, U.S. CONSIDERS MAKING TRITIUM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Tenn., S.C. Wash.)  (jw) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A potential shortage of tritium, a crucial
ingredient of every nuclear weapon, has prompted the Department of
Energy to consider whether to recommend starting one of the
department's rare public-works-style projects to manufacture more
of the radioactive gas.
</P>
<P>
   With the department's decision due within three weeks, the issue
has set off intense lobbying by congressional delegations from
Alabama, Tennessee, South Carolina and Washington state, which are
hoping for a share of what could be a $9 billion project.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Energy William Richardson is juggling issues of
cost, risk and image. The two solutions that may be easiest and
least expensive are those creating the biggest image problem: using
a civilian reactor to make tritium _ and breaking a 50-year taboo
on mixing civilian and military atomic projects _ or buying the
material from Russia or France.
</P>
<P>
   More expensive and technically difficult would be to restart a
research reactor that runs on plutonium, which presents safety
questions, or to build a linear accelerator 100 times more powerful
than any yet built in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have dallied long enough on this decision,''
Richardson said in remarks to reporters last week after a tour of a
partly completed Alabama nuclear reactor. The Tennessee Valley
Authority gave up on the reactor 10 years ago, but the site is now
a potential tritium factory.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson also toured the Savannah River Site, a nuclear plant
near Aiken, S.C., where an accelerator might go. And on Monday, he
is due at the TVA's Watts Bar reactor, a power plant where test
production of tritium is already under way. Another possibility is
a now-shuttered plutonium-powered reactor at the Energy
Department's Hanford, Wash., nuclear reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has repeatedly promised that politics would not be
the basis of a decision. But the issue has already been the subject
of several votes in Congress and of letters from many members
urging favorable treatment of their states.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, and the Atomic Energy Commission before
it, was once famous for multibillion dollar projects, but since the
cancellation of the Super Conducting Supercollider in 1993 and the
contraction of the nuclear weapons production complex in the sunset
of the Cold War, such projects have become rare.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of huge spending on a tritium plant argue that the
department should put off spending money until the future size of
America's nuclear arsenal becomes clearer.
</P>
<P>
   In that, the Energy Department's problem parallels the
Pentagon's. The Defense Department has to decide on hundreds of
millions of dollars in investments to maintain some nuclear weapons
and launching platforms without knowing whether new agreements with
the Russians will result in the dismantling of those systems in a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian parliament is scheduled to debate the second round
of strategic arms reduction talks, known as START II, next month.
If it approves the agreement, the date by which new tritium will be
needed moves to 2011 from 2005 and the amount required will be cut
by one third.
</P>
<P>
   Tritium, a form of hydrogen, is used to improve the efficiency
of fission in uranium and plutonium, and is stored as a gas in
nuclear weapons for that purpose. It decays at 5.5 percent a year
and must be replenished.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department's last reactor for producing tritium broke
down in 1988, and the department says that by 2005 it will not have
enough tritium to keep all existing weapons functional without
dipping into a five-year reserve.
</P>
<P>
   The time remaining to find a solution is short relative to the
years needed to build any new tritium plant, and Richardson has
promised to announce a decision by the end of the year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is already late, in fact, for the accelerator option. An
accelerator would make tritium by bombarding tungsten with
sub-atomic particles. Even if that project goes forward as
scheduled _ which is unusual for first-of-a-kind efforts at the
Energy Department _ it will not produce tritium until 2007.
</P>
<P>
   But even that may not be too late. The end of the Cold War has
bought the department some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Cold War had not ended, we'd have run out of tritium
long before now,'' said Troy Wade, who was the assistant secretary
for defense programs when the last of the production reactors, at
the agency's Savannah River Site, broke down. In the interim, the
department has cannibalized weapons being decommissioned, giving us
``a cushion we could not have predicted 10 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say that if further arms reduction agreements are
reached with Russia, or if the United States simply decides it does
not need so many nuclear weapons, then a new tritium source can
wait for years, and the level needed to make up for decay _ 2 to 3
kilograms, or up to 6.6 pounds, a year to maintain the current
arsenal _ could shrink further.
</P>
<P>
   But the department is planning to produce enough tritium to
sustain the current arsenal, as specified under the first round of
strategic arms reduction talks, known as START I.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, the department is considering several unconventional
steps. A previous energy secretary, Hazel O'Leary, rejected
building a new reactor as too expensive.
</P>
<P>
   But in September 1997, operators loaded 32 ``target'' rods from
the Energy Department into the core of the TVA's Watts Bar reactor,
which has been operating steadily since then, its neutrons
splitting the lithium metal inside the rods into tritium and
helium. This spring, when Watts Bar is scheduled to shut for
refueling, the department will remove the targets and recover the
tritium.
</P>
<P>
   Civilian utilities once avoided military contracts, for fear
such projects would sour the public on new reactors. Since no one
expects a utility to order a new reactor in the next few years,
that objection has died away.
</P>
<P>
   But local environmental activists and some foreign policy
experts object. As the Congressional Budget Office pointed out in a
recent report, ``For years the United States has strongly urged
other countries not to put civilian reactors to military uses.''
</P>
<P>
   Using already-completed reactors is the least expensive option;
the Congressional Budget Office said buying ``irradiation
services'' would cost about $1.1 billion compared with $2.3 billion
for helping finish the Alabama reactor, Bellefonte, and about $6
billion for the accelerator. The accelerator may also pose a higher
risk of delays and cost overruns.
</P>
<P>
   Tritium is also sold commercially for about $30 million a
kilogram (about 2.2 pounds), and some experts have suggested buying
it from France or Russia. ``There's plenty, and at a relatively low
price,'' said Richard Garland, a senior fellow for science and
technology at the Council on Foreign Relations. If bought far in
advance, he said, the seller would have no leverage over the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan B. Rohlfing, a senior adviser to the energy secretary,
said that the idea, while it had been discussed, was not practical
because the tritium would have to be bought far in advance of need,
and every 12 years, half of it disappears through radioactive
decay. For the price, she said, the Energy Department could develop
its own production system.
</P>
<P>
   Buying tritium from Russia also would doubtless be vigorously
opposed by many members of the Russian parliament _ which for six
years has stalled on ratification of the newest arms control treaty
_ as dangerous and unpatriotic.

ATLANTA WARMS SLOWLY TO FALCONS TEAM AS IT BEGINS TO TAKE OFF

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This city has never really loved them, not the way
Cleveland used to love its Browns, when it had them, or the way
Pittsburgh loves the Steelers, and certainly not the way Green Bay
loves its Packers. But then, as the cliche goes, it is easy to love
a winner, even if the trophies have dust on them.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta has never loved its often-disappointing Falcons even
as much as New Orleans loves its often-hapless Saints or as much as
Massachusetts loves its Patriots, even as they prepare to move to,
of all places, Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   So, when this city shows even a little love for a team that is
all of a sudden off to its best start in franchise history, when
fans cross their fingers and whisper, ``Super Bowl,'' with that
faraway hope some people have of finding buried treasure or winning
the lottery, it is news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the mall with my daughter, taking her shopping, and I
saw our jerseys in the front window of a store,'' said Charley
Taylor, the Falcons' director of public relations for the last 12
years. ``First time I've seen that.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Taylor said, the jerseys are from the Georgia Bulldogs
or the Atlanta Braves or someone, anyone, but the Falcons, whose
franchise record over 33 years was, at the end of last season, a
sad 182 wins, 293 losses and five ties, among the worst in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   But 1998 has been magic. Going into this weekend, the Falcons,
with nine victories and two losses, are at the top of their
division, the West, in the National Football Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   And slowly, tentatively, people are beginning to hope, to
believe, even to cut loose and dance a little. A thing called the
``Dirty Bird,'' kind of a cross between the Funky Chicken, and
well, something else, is all the rage. The Falcons do it when they
score a touchdown, and even a few people in the stands do it.
</P>
<P>
   It is not pandemonium. It is not a town going wild, people here
say.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta is not like Pittsburgh, where real steelworkers come and
cheer their Steelers. It is a corporate town, powered by big banks,
Delta Air Lines, Coca-Cola, by women and men in suits who, more
often than not, came here from someplace else, who arrive at
Atlanta Braves baseball games three innings late and leave in the
seventh, to dodge traffic, and really do read The Wall Street
Journal during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many people that are from other states,'' said
Barbara Sanders, who, along with her husband, John, has been a
Falcons season-ticket holder for almost a quarter-century. ``I've
recently undergone some chemotherapy, and my doctor is a Jets fan.
I had to go to the eye doctor recently, and a woman there is a
Pittsburgh Steelers fan. People here will say they'll pull for the
Falcons, if their team isn't playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 62-year-old Mrs. Sanders, who said she was feeling much
better and hoped she had beaten back her cancer, said she would go
to the games as long as she was able, ``even if I have to wear a
wig.'' But she is a little disgusted, sometimes, at how delicate
some Falcons fans can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat near a woman who had cotton stuffed in her ears''
because she thought the fans yelled too loud, Mrs. Sanders said.
``That made me yell even louder. If you're going to go to the game
and sit on your hands, then go and watch `The Nutcracker' or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who have come to Atlanta have come to live not so
much in a city as in the vicinity of one. Atlanta is not one city
but several, with neighborhoods of people who consider themselves
Atlantans stretching as far as 20 miles away, commuting on
often-packed freeways, as new residents distance themselves from
the poorer city center.
</P>
<P>
   But the Falcons, Taylor said, have the power to unify the city,
simply by winning. He has seen it before, when he worked with the
Washington Redskins in the early 1980s, the championship years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All races, all cultures feel a part of it'' when a team starts
winning, Taylor said. ``Few things can cause that kind of
crossover.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have always been more of a blue-collar draw than the
Braves, and have always drawn more black fans. But they have seldom
won, though they have often teased. Year after year, except when
the losses piled up so high that even the optimistic fans could not
see over them, the Falcons have won just often enough to get
people's hopes up, fans here say.
</P>
<P>
   Even with talk of a Super Bowl berth beginning to hum around the
city, many people here are still reluctant to dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``After years of not getting what you have expected, you still
might not be sure that you want to put everything that you have
into it'' emotionally, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, it is fun to dream, and to see, week after week,
that dream take firmer form.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sanders is already planning a trip to Miami, to the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Albright, who works in sales for an Atlanta company, has
been a season ticket-holder since the beginning. ``I have never
given up,'' he said. ``I stick to the last play of the last game.
My wife gets frustrated with me.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albright is pragmatic. He does not expect miracles. He
expected this team to be good, but perhaps not this good. ``I am
cautiously optimistic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even at 9-2 with one of the best records in football, the
Falcons do not sell out their stadium, causing local blackouts of
televisions games; teams that do not sell out are often blacked
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans are so fickle,'' Albright said. But these players, he
said, have something worth watching, something football fans
respect:
</P>
<P>
   Guts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if they got their butts kicked they just laid
down,'' and by the start of the second half the fans could tell a
game was already over, Albright said. ``You don't see that
happening now.''
</P>
<P>
   If only, Mrs. Sanders said, the fans could mirror that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really, really easy to like a team when it's winning,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And now, they are.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: THE NOBLE IDEAL OF RATIONALISM IN NAZI
DRESDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By October 1936, Victor Klemperer, a Jew, had been removed from
his professorship at the Technical University in Dresden, Germany.
He and his ``Aryan'' wife, Eva, lived in a small house of their own
in a rural suburb of Dresden. They were ``virtually destitute,''
Klemperer notes in ``I Will Bear Witness,'' his diary of the years
from 1933 to 1941. (A second volume, to 1945, will be published
next year. Klemperer died in Dresden in 1960.)
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of finding an appointment abroad, Klemperer had begun
writing letters to friends and scholars all around the world, but
it was already too late, as he well knew, and he considered himself
bound to Germany. The house and its garden were the chief
adornments of Eva's life, and, as Klemperer later said of his
marriage, ``I have always seemed glorious to myself on this one
point of love and faithfulness.'' Eva, who shared all of her
husband's privations, might have said the same.
</P>
<P>
   No single metaphor can convey the oppressive reality of living
in a world that becomes, without limits, steadily more menacing and
constricted. Every day Klemperer weighed his wife's infirmities,
which were many. Every day he retallied the dwindling supply of
marks and pfennigs and reassessed the restrictions the Nazis had
imposed _ the loss of library privileges and the right to buy
tobacco and to drive a car and to live in one's own home and,
eventually, to move about the streets without wearing a yellow
star. Yet every day, with few exceptions, Klemperer wrote in his
diary and worked on a scholarly study of 18th-century literature.
It was a labor not of desperate distraction but of love.
</P>
<P>
   Something about Klemperer makes him the most extraordinary
German witness of Nazism that has yet come to light. Reviewers have
mentioned his literary skill and his determination to chronicle the
details that the historical record would miss _ details that he, a
Jew cast away in a sea of anti-Semitism, read as auguries of his
fate. These are great qualities indeed, but what illuminates them
is his faith in reason.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1936, Klemperer notes both Hitler's attack on
``intellectualism'' and the widespread credulity among German
people that grounded Hitler's attack. In words that still apply
today, Klemperer writes: ``People treat reason as if it were the
most minor and harmful aspect of a whole human being. It is as if a
soldier standing guard were to say to himself: What good would my
rifle be, if I were now to be attacked by a dozen enemies? I shall
therefore lay it aside and smoke opium cigarettes until I doze
off.''
</P>
<P>
   For Klemperer, reason had nothing to do with class or profession
or even intelligence. All around him he saw professors and
intellectuals who abandoned reason for self-interest, who sided or
temporized with the Nazis. He saw so many, in fact, that if he were
to determine the fate of the Germans he might let ordinary people
and even some leaders go. ``But I would have all the intellectuals
strung up, and the professors three feet higher than the rest; they
would be left hanging from the lampposts for as long as was
compatible with hygiene.''
</P>
<P>
   Klemperer was an heir of the Enlightenment, of Voltaire and
Montesquieu, and he demonstrates that reason is not only a quality
of mind _ in his case a deeply moral perception _ but also a
cultural tradition of enormous value, one that has come under
question in our own time. His example suggests that there can be no
post-Enlightenment, only a sub-Enlightenment. There is nothing cold
or distanced about the cast of Klemperer's character. Reason is a
refuge in him from the emotions that flayed him and every Jew, as
well as every reasonable German, while Hitler consolidated his
power.
</P>
<P>
   But it allowed Klemperer to penetrate the historical moment with
unrivaled acuity. In January 1939, in a nation mad over race,
Klemperer writes, ``Race, in the sense of pure blood, is a
zoological concept, and a concept that long ago ceased to
correspond to any reality, is at any rate less a reality than the
old strict distinction between the spheres of man and wife.'' Then
he adds: ``The solution of the Jewish question can only be found in
the deliverance from those who have invented it. And the world _
because now this really does concern the world _ will be forced to
act accordingly.'' &QL;

WILLIAMS' RECORD IS AS BIG AS TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It could have been considered a victory lap,
even though it was only halfway around the track at Darrell K.
Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium, and even though it was done from the
driver's seat of a black Chevy Tahoe.
</P>
<P>
   Texas running back Ricky Williams, his head sticking out of the
truck window, his dreadlocks billowing in the breeze, was all
smiles on Friday as he waved to the few fans who remained in the
stadium two hours after he had run his way into National Collegiate
Athletic Association history.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was fitting that Williams left the stadium in a large
four-wheel-drive vehicle. It was merely a continuation of an
unstoppable theme that Williams had established at the beginning of
the Longhorns' game against rival Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   It was probably the only way that Williams would have been able
to make his way out of the stadium. After running for 259 yards on
44 carries and catching five passes for 36 yards, Williams was
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Only two hours after breaking Tony Dorsett's 23-year-old
Division I-A record for most career rushing yards and Napoleon
McCallum's Division I-A record for all-purpose yards, Williams had
planned the perfect celebration: ``I just want to go home and take
a nap. I'm pretty tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams took a low-key approach to his accomplishment, although
there was quite a bit of hubbub surrounding it. Three Heisman
Trophy winners, Dorsett, Earl Campbell and John David Crow, were in
attendance. There was a ceremony at midfield at the end of the game
and a videotape of highlights from Williams' career at Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said it was special that Dorsett, Campbell, a star at
Texas himself, and Crow, a great running back at Texas A&AMP;M, were on
hand. He said the ceremony was special and the videotape was nice,
although he couldn't see it because he had cameras in his face.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams didn't appear bowled over by any of it. He was
asked if he ever thought when he left San Diego for the University
of Texas that he would wind up with more than a dozen NCAA records,
including Dorsett's career rushing mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never. Never. Never. Ever. Never,'' he said. ``My first game I
was upset I only got 10 carries. In this game, I got 44. I never
thought it would be like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsett, who has visited with Williams on a few occasions, said
having Williams break his record was like having his own son do it.
It was the second rushing record that Dorsett had lost in the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 8, Emmitt Smith broke his Dallas Cowboys rushing record.
Dorsett was not invited to Texas Stadium to stand on the sideline
for that occasion. But he was for Williams' special day.
</P>
<P>
   Williams entered the game needing 63 yards to break Dorsett's
mark of 6,082 set at Pittsburgh in 1976, and when he cracked
through the line and broke free on a 60-yard touchdown run, Dorsett
was jumping up and down with excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the record would stand for a while, but I didn't think
it would last this long,'' Dorsett said. ``The run that he had to
break the record was nice, because people will always remember him
for that. And that showed everything that Ricky Williams is all
about as a running back _ size, speed and quickness.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams described the run as if it were a routine toss sweep
that went for a first down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an isolation play to the left,'' he said and, then, in
reference to to offensive linemen Roger Roesler and Octavious
Bishop, continued: ``Roger and Big O did a great job of opening up
the hole. I got a great block downfield from Wane McGarity and the
rest was easy. I had a smile after I broke that one tackle. I knew
I had the record and hopefully a touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   The tough part came when he returned to the sideline, out of
breath from the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was exhausted,'' Williams said. ``I came to the side and I
was mobbed by the whole team. I couldn't breathe and I was trying
to say help, but I couldn't get anything out. They wouldn't have
heard me anyway. It's just very special for everyone involved in
this program. I'm just happy that I can make everyone proud of
me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Williams shared the honors with his mother, Sandy, and two
sisters, who have always been a part of his career at Texas.
Williams, who signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia
Phillies in 1995, used some of his baseball bonus money to relocate
his mother from San Diego to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   He also paid college tuition for his sisters _ Nisey is a
sophomore and his twin, Cassie, is a senior, just a semester behind
Williams. He expects to graduate in the spring with a degree in
education.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Coach Mack Brown expressed his gratitude to Williams when
Williams decided to forgo the National Football League draft in
April and return to Texas for his senior season. Brown, who took
over a demoralized program that had gone 4-7 the year before,
needed Williams to help him put the football program back on its
feet.
</P>
<P>
   The coach built an offense around Williams and gave the team a
rallying point _ make Williams a Heisman Trophy winner. It has been
a mutually beneficial situation. The Longhorns are now 8-3 with one
more game to play _ probably in the Cotton Bowl _ and Brown should
be able to recruit some talent. Williams, with his new NCAA
records, is in prime position for the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was worth it the first game I played,'' Williams said
regarding his decision to return to Texas for his senior season.
``It's always been worth it. The team has been great. The coaching
staff has been great. I've enjoyed myself thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Williams has surpassed Dorsett as the leading rusher in
Division I-A, his place among the best running backs in the game
will be debated. His rushing total of 6,279 (and counting) puts him
ahead of Dorsett, Charles White (Southern Cal), Herschel Walker
(Georgia) and Archie Griffin (Ohio State).
</P>
<P>
   His size (6 feet, 225 pounds), speed and power put him in the
same class as some of the NFL's best today, like Denver's Terrell
Davis, Tennessee's Eddie George and Detroit's Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, I can be considered one of the best,'' Williams
said. ``I've been on a couple of great teams and I've had
outstanding offensive lines since I've been here, so all the credit
should go to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Williams is the best running back he has ever seen
and believes Williams is indeed the best running back ever in
college.
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman Trophy would at least certify Williams as the best
football player in college this season. But in his own style,
Williams said he isn't sweating the balloting. He has other things
on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have finals that week, so I have to study for those,''
Williams said.

EDITORIAL: JANET RENO'S DWINDLING CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Time said in an editorial for Sun., Nov. 29:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno's decision last week to clear Vice
President Al Gore of campaign illegalities was hardly surprising.
Gore's telephone soliciting from government property was one of the
Clinton campaign's more innocuous fund-raising activities, and the
evidence was mixed. But Sen. Orrin Hatch was right to send up a
warning about Reno's motives. The need for an independent counsel
with broad powers to examine the White House's 1996 fund-raising
has been established by journalistic accounts and congressional
hearings, and by legal opinions from the director of the FBI and
the former chief prosecutor of the Justice Department's
campaign-finance task force. So far Reno has managed to avoid
taking their advice by singling out subsidiary activities like
Gore's phone calls and citing narrow legal grounds for preliminary
inquiries. In the days ahead, Hatch warned, we will learn whether
the attorney general will undermine ``the rule of law and integrity
of the Department of Justice'' by preventing an unbiased inquiry
into the Democratic effort to circumvent campaign laws, to use
White House invitations to entice donors and to collect suspicious
foreign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has two more opportunities to do her duty and appoint an
independent counsel to investigate such suspicious activities. The
clock is still running on preliminary inquiries into Harold Ickes,
the former deputy White House chief of staff who planned the 1996
re-election effort, and into the White House use of party money to
pay for thinly disguised re-election ads. As the FBI director,
Louis Freeh, and the former chief prosecutor, Charles La Bella,
have concluded, the evidence is serious enough to require Reno to
recuse herself in favor of a prosecutor who does not report to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is not the only official who needs to come to grips with
issues of law and conscience. The Federal Election Commission is
due this week to rule on a staff audit of Clinton's re-election
campaign. The audit is said to conclude that the use of unregulated
``soft money'' for Clinton's re-election advertising violated the
election laws. The six-member commission is often divided on
partisan lines on campaign issues. But in their meeting this week,
the commissioners could decide to reject the auditors' finding.
They are under pressure to do so because if Clinton's ads violated
the law, so probably did the soft-money ads for Bob Dole, the
Republican nominee. We urge the commissioners to endorse the
findings of the auditors and close a loophole through which the
presidential candidates drove tens of millions of dollars in
illegal fund raising and spending.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the commission does, Reno should accept the auditors'
finding _ and those of Freeh and La Bella _ that this issue must be
decided by someone not beholden to Clinton and his inner circle.
This is more than a technical issue. The law says that unregulated
soft money can only go to certain party-building activities like
voter registration and get-out-the-vote drives. If Reno and the
Federal Election Commission look the other way while candidates
circumvent the law, the parties will simply step up their
shakedowns of corporations, unions and rich donors to finance
election campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   With the Gore case out of the way, many in Washington believe it
more likely that Reno will appoint an independent counsel to look
into alleged misstatements by Ickes. But any counsel needs a
mandate that goes beyond a single official or even the admittedly
substantial issue of soft-money purchases of television time. The
White House was at the center of a pervasively reckless
fund-raising operation, and the government still does not know the
full extent of the shadowy fund raising from foreign sources, the
extent to which favors were traded to China or its business allies,
and whether Chinese government money went into campaign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Reno keeps boasting that her actions are based on micro-readings
of the statutes. Hatch is right that she has an overarching
obligation to provide answers to bigger allegations of conspiracy
and corruption measured in millions. If Reno takes a dive, Congress
will have to find a way next year to get those investigative
answers. Reno, for her part, will have nailed down the title of the
most politically compromised attorney general since Watergate.

ULTRA-RICH BALLPLAYERS HAVE REINSDORF TO THANK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., N.Y., Mass., Calif., Wash.)  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   What hath Jerry Reinsdorf wrought?
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago White Sox owner hasn't made a major free-agent
signing in two years, but the last one he did, Albert Belle,
triggered the escalating activity that reached a frenzy last week.
Bernie Williams and Mo Vaughn, not to mention Mike Piazza, can nod
in Reinsdorf's direction because his signing of Belle on Nov. 19,
1996, made their contracts possible.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball is hurtling toward its first $100 million
contract, and while salaries have been escalating since free agency
was created in 1976, the Belle contract thrust the salary scale
into a higher orbit.
</P>
<P>
   When bad Albert became a free agent following the 1996 season,
the highest-paid player in baseball was Ken Griffey Jr., who
earlier that year signed a four-year contract for $8.5 million a
year. To put in perspective what Reinsdorf did for baseball
contracts, it took four years to get from Ryne Sandberg's record
$7.1 million to Griffey's $8.5 million, an increase of 19.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   If, in signing Belle, Reinsdorf had raised the scale by the same
percentage, Belle would have received just under $10.2 million a
year. But no reason to stop there. The White Sox owner asked Arn
Tellem, Belle's agent, what he wanted, then gave it to him _ $11
million a year _ sending the top of the scale soaring by 29.4
percent only 10 months later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Reinsdorf agreed to a clause that enabled Belle to
become a free agent if three players had higher salaries. He is in
that position now and has until Wednesday to decide if he wants to
remain with the White Sox or go elsewhere. If it is elsewhere _
Baltimore _ he will do it for even more money than Reinsdorf gave
him.
</P>
<P>
   Tellem wanted the clause because he didn't know where the market
was headed, and he wanted to make sure Belle suddenly didn't become
underpaid. Any player who signs a long-term contract faces that
possibility. But Reinsdorf wanted Belle so he capitulated on that
issue, too.
</P>
<P>
   Now Belle is in position to sign with the Orioles for $13
million a year for five years, which, at least for today, would
place him in a tie for second for the highest annual average
salary. Piazza ($13 million) eclipsed Pedro Martinez of Boston
($12.5 million) with his Mets' contract in October, then was
supplanted himself last week when Vaughn ($13,333,333) signed with
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the soaring, leapfrogging
salaries at the upper end of the scale has been the silence of
Griffey. Many consider him the best player in the game, but he has
plummeted from No. 1 to a tie for 12th and he has never suggested
that his contract be renegotiated to get him back to the top of the
scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``You haven't heard him say anything; that's not his style,''
Woody Woodward, the Seattle general manager, said. ``That's the way
he's always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's contract expires after the 2000 season, the same time
that his teammate, Alex Rodriguez, ends his contract. The Mariners
are warily watching the salaries soar onward and upward. By the
time Junior and A. Rod sign new contracts, they might own the
Mariners' new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have the two best all-around players in the game,''
Woodward said, ``looking at power, speed and defense, arms and the
positions they play. My position has been and continues to be both
of these fellows came through our system and I'd like to see them
both finish their careers with Seattle.''

   NEW YORK _ Enveloped in the thick greenhouse humidity at the New
York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, 4-year-old Caleb Orange romped
along the conservatory pathways, ignoring fascinating plants like
the giant Burmese honeysuckle, otherwise known as Lonicera
hildebrandiana.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Caleb cocked his head heavenward and exclaimed with
delight as the red and green model train cars of the North Pole
Rail Company rolled across a bridge made of sticks and twigs high
above the conservatory floor. ``Wow,'' he said, as the electric
cars click-clacked over his head. ``Look at that one.''
</P>
<P>
   The bridge carries just a fraction of the nearly 1,000 feet of
model train track that runs through the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory
as part of ``A Victorian Holiday,'' the New York Botanical Garden's
seventh annual Christmastime display, which opened Friday and runs
through Jan. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Another model train display opened Saturday at the Brooklyn
Botanic Garden, which is hoping to capitalize on the special
fascination people have with trains to boost winter attendance, as
its Bronx rival has done quite successfully.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Botanical Garden, holiday season attendance used
to dip below 20,000, said John Rorer, the garden's executive vice
president and chief operating officer. Last year more than 65,000
people visited the train exhibit, and this year more than 100,000
are expected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the train displays have become increasingly
elaborate and expensive. This year's display, paid for by private
donations, cost about $135,000. It includes bridges, waterfalls and
models of historic New York City buildings, like a 1799 Gracie
Mansion, all made from plant materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The holiday train show has sort of created a new season for
the New York Botanical Garden,'' Rorer said. ``What would have in
years past been a fairly small attendance has now become a growing
audience. The trains have really become the platform on which we
have built a whole new holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   Several visitors admitted that they had not visited the gardens
except to see the train displays. Garden officials said the trains
held a particular interest for children that encouraged more
families to visit, a point that was reinforced by the dozens of
strollers whizzing through the Haupt Conservatory.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Frank Conti, 4, who was with his parents, Carlo and Frances, was
jumping up and down in front of one track area. Like an undersize,
over-anxious commuter, he shouted, ``I want to see a choo-choo
train. I want to see a choo-choo.''
</P>
<P>
   The Contis, who live in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., saw last year's
train display and delayed a visit to Grandma to see this one. ``He
got us up early to drive down here,'' Conti said of his son. ``We
asked him if he wanted to stop at his grandma's, he said, `Let's do
it after.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx display was designed by Paul G. Busse, a landscaper
and architect from Cincinnati, whose company, Applied Imaginations,
is one of the country's premier designers of garden railway
displays. Busse designed his first large display for the Ohio State
Fair in 1982. The trains and track for both the Bronx and Brooklyn
displays are on loan from Aristo-Craft Trains of Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   Garden railroading, which involves larger model trains known as
G-scale that can run both indoors and out (even in light rain), is
an increasingly popular hobby. Conventions now often draw thousands
of fans and Garden Railways, a hobbyist magazine, is celebrating
its 15th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Busse and his staff construct the miniature buildings, bridges
and other display components by hand, using natural materials like
leaves, bark and branches. Garden railroading, he said, combines
the traditionally distinct hobbies of gardening and train
collecting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We touch the people who love miniatures,'' he said, ``we touch
the people who love trains, we touch the people who love gardens,
we touch the people who love waterfalls.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Morris Arboretum in Philadelphia, a train display helped
triple attendance, Busse said. ``Gardens are beautiful but I think
trains bring the sense of imagination and bring it alive,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The display in Brooklyn is the garden's first. Five trains roll
through tunnels, past model buildings designed to reflect the
borough in a wintry setting. There is a row of brownstones and a
replica of the Brooklyn bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Zuk, the president of the botanic garden, said she hoped
the display would grow in future years and would draw more
winter-time visitors. ``We want to encourage people to come out
here not just for the cherry blossoms and the lilacs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the two train exhibits raised the prospect of further
inter-borough rivalry. ``Look, we are great colleagues and friendly
competitors,'' said Karl Lauby, a spokesman for the New York
Botanical Garden, noting that all botanical gardens benefit from
interesting exhibits that draw attention and appreciation. He
added, ``Imitation is a sincere form of flattery.'' &QL;

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: THOSE WACKY RED SOX; TALE OF TWO CONTRACTS;
DASHING THE BUCK-AND-BERNIE THEORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a new seven-year contract in his pocket, Bernie Williams
should finish his career with the Yankees. And every time he sees
the Boston Red Sox, he should express his gratitude because they
made it possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Boras wins again,'' an American League general manager
said. ``He had nothing until Dan Duquette.'' He referred to the Red
Sox general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Duquette goes ahead and offers 87 and a half for Bernie on
Tuesday and Wednesday the Yankees matched his mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox offered Williams $87.5 million for seven years. Two
weeks earlier they offered Mo Vaughn $63 million for five years,
and when he rejected it, they said bye, bye to one of the most
popular athletes in Boston sports history, a player who had carried
them on his burly back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what's going through their heads,'' one general
manager said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make any sense,'' said an agent.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox signing of Jose Offerman two weeks ago to a
four-year, $26 million contract outraged other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no accountability there,'' said an executive of a
National League club. ``They have no owner there. It's a trust.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive said he was told by the general manager of another
club that one of Offerman's agents, in talking to clubs about the
vastly improved infielder, sought less money than the Red Sox gave
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Leary, Wakefield, Garciaparra, Martinez, Offerman and he
almost did it with Williams,'' an American League general manager
said, rattling off names of players whose contracts other clubs
found to be unnecessarily inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   Short Term vs. Long Term
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Bernie Williams once again raised questions about
the Yankees' practice of not signing their good young players to
long-term contracts. The Cleveland Indians have followed the
opposite practice, prompting other teams, such as the Angels, to
sign their young players at least through the salary arbitration
years.
</P>
<P>
   A comparison between Williams and Jim Thome tells a revealing
financial tale.
</P>
<P>
   When Thome had between one and two years of major league
service, the Indians signed him to a four-year contract. Then
during the fourth year, in 1997, they signed him to a four-year
extension. In the past five years they have paid Thome a total of
$10.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had between one and two years of major league service
at the same time as Thome, entering the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   There was no multiyear contract for Williams then; nor was there
any until last week. Going year by year, the Yankees the past five
years have paid Williams $17,225,000.
</P>
<P>
   Some agents recommend that their clients shun multiyear
contracts early in their careers. Thome's agent, in fact, urged him
not to accept either contract. But the money and the security were
too great for Thome to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Yankees have Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera eligible for
salary arbitration for the first time, and those players, as well
as Andy Pettitte, remain unencumbered by a multiyear contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some conversations last year and we agreed not to do
it,'' Casey Close, Jeter's agent, said. ``We couldn't agree on
preliminary stuff. I expect they'll bring it up this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Jeter and friends use the arbitration system, the
Yankees have committed $66 million for 17 players for next season.
They expect to have an opening-day payroll of about $81 million, up
from a season-ending payroll of $65.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   The only teams close to them in present payroll are Cleveland
($67.2 million for 18 players) and Atlanta ($65.65 million for 13
players).
</P>
<P>
   No Conspiracy Theory
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to the conspiracy theory espoused by some baseball
executives last February, Scott Boras did not have a deal with the
Arizona Diamondbacks to deliver Bernie Williams to them.
</P>
<P>
   That so-called deal was the subject of hot speculation after the
Diamondbacks signed Andy Benes, another Boras client, as a free
agent. The expansion team, the theory went, helped Boras by signing
Benes, and he, in turn, would make sure Williams signed with them
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's logical for people to speculate in terms of Buck and
Bernie,'' Colangelo said at the time, referring to his manager,
Buck Showalter, who had been Williams' manager in New York. ``Now
there will be speculation because of the business I've done with
Boras.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo was interested in Williams this month but never got
serious enough with an offer to lure him to the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In his effort to secure a record contract for Williams, Boras
prepared a 23-page booklet of data on the center fielder. On one
page, the agent got carried away. Citing his defensive ability,
Boras said Williams was ranked the major leagues' No. 1 center
fielder in the Elias rankings, which are used to determine
compensation for free agents. Williams was No. 1 all right, but not
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   The rankings use a complex formula based on a series of
statistics, and in the case of outfielders, they are all hitting
statistics _ plate appearances, batting average, on-base
percentage, home runs and runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   No fly balls caught or missed, no assists, no errors.

MORE OLYMPIC GOLD BECKONS SKIER DAEHLIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do Paavo Nurmi of Finland, Larysa Latynina of the former
Soviet Union and Mark Spitz and Carl Lewis of the United States
have in common?
</P>
<P>
   Each won a record nine Olympic gold medals during remarkable
careers, and each is in danger of being surpassed in February 2002.
</P>
<P>
   That is because the cross-country skier Bjorn Daehlie has
concluded that he has not yet experienced enough burning in his
muscular legs or oxygen deprivation in his voluminous lungs in a
remarkable competitive career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit that it would be quite nice to pass Carl Lewis,''
the 31-year-old Norwegian said in a telephone interview earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Daehlie nearly passed out in his last Olympic race: the men's
50-kilometer event at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. The
instant he crossed the finish line, he pitched forward as if he had
been hit from behind by something blunt and heavy. He had already
set a Winter Olympic record in Nagano by winning his sixth and
seventh gold medals. Now he had his eighth, and he was as spent as
he had ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that was my hardest race ever,'' Daehlie said. ``I
saw the gold medal going away in the last two kilometers, and it
was hard to push myself because I was already completely
exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to Nagano, Daehlie talked openly about
his plans to retire, saying he needed to spend more time with his
two young sons, Sivert and Sander, and their mother, Vilde. But
when he finally felt capable of speaking after what could have been
his final victory, he hedged on quitting. After discussing the idea
at length with his family, he has stopped bothering to hedge, and
the truth is that 31 might be old for a running back, but not for a
cross-country skier. In the 1994 Olympics, an Italian, Maurilio De
Zolt, won the gold medal in the men's relay at age 43.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of retiring was quite strong in me,'' Daehlie said.
``But the problem is, when you have been doing this for 10 years,
it's a part of your life, part of the way you're living. You don't
want to stop when you physically feel 100 percent. It might seem
difficult to understand when you see what skiing requires, but I
think I have a special connection with this sport. I dream about
the big events and all the pressure when everyone is trying to be
really fast. It's quite something to succeed when everyone has the
same goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Norwegians apparently agree. In a poll conducted last month by
the newspaper Verdens Gang, readers were asked to name their
``Norwegian of the 20th century.'' Daehlie came in third behind the
explorer and humanist Thor Heyerdahl and Norway's first female
Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland. In fourth place was Fridtjof
Nansen, a former Nobel Peace Prize winner and North Pole explorer.
Other notables were, in sixth, Roald Amundsen, the first man to
reach the South Pole and, eighth, Edvard Munch, one of the
century's foremost painters. Munch's most widely known work, ``The
Scream,'' is a fine approximation of how Daehlie looked at the end
of his 50K race in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Norway, there are a lot of children right now who would
like to be me; they are competing and falling over the finish
line,'' Daehlie said wryly.
</P>
<P>
   Daehlie's professional goal is to compete until the Winter
Olympics in Salt Lake City in 2002. But he has personal goals as
well, and so he no longer plans to train with the Norwegian
national team in the off season. Until this month, he was training
on his own near his home in Nannestad, and he also no longer
intends to compete for the overall World Cup title. After the World
Cup season begins on Monday, he plans to race regularly until
Christmas and then peak for the world championships in Ramsau,
Austria, in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being out with the team for 200 days a year in hotels is a bit
problematic for being a father,'' Daehlie said. ``So far, it has
been going very well, and if it works I will keep the same program
until Salt Lake.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in Salt Lake City that Daehlie won his first World Cup
race in December 1989, and Daehlie said that the desire to come
full circle was part of his decision to ski on. So was financial
security, and Daehlie, unlike many a Norwegian skikonge (ski king)
of Olympiads past is increasingly secure. He has numerous sponsors
and his own clothing company, whose outfits the American Nordic
team will be wearing in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   What Daehlie wants is to convert Americans to his sport, which
is about as popular with spectators in the United States as cricket
or bullfighting and lacks a worldwide base and talent pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little hard for me to be famous in America I think, but
it would be nice to present cross-country skiing in America like
Stein Eriksen did with Alpine skiing,'' Daehlie said.
</P>
<P>
   Eriksen, a fellow Norwegian, won the giant slalom at the 1952
Winter Olympics in Oslo and three gold medals at the 1954 world
championships. He then directed ski schools at numerous American
resorts, playing a role in popularizing skiing with his worldly
manner and good looks.
</P>
<P>
   Daehlie recognizes that the pain etched on his face in
mid-effort and the icicles that form on his red eyebrows are not
necessarily the perfect pitch, but he is not really interested in
pushing weekend athletes beyond their limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want is to get more children out of the house and out
in the forest,'' he said. ``Because in Europe, the people,
especially the young people are more and more sitting still and
watching videos or using the Internet. It was quite different 10 or
15 years ago, and I am concerned for my sport and the way people
are living right now. We are not using our bodies the way we
should.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cross-country is maybe the greatest way to work out for
people. You know, in the United States, the Nordic Track machine is
a best seller, and it's a machine where you ski in your living
room. But the best way of doing it is in the nature. You need to
breathe the air, see the birds and the animals. That way the next
generation knows that the meat doesn't just come from shops.''
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of Daehlies already knows. Sivert, age 4,
began competing in cross-country races last winter. Sander, not yet
2, was recently given his first pair of skis. There are plenty of
other Norwegian children receiving the same treatment. Daehlie's
records could already be in danger, and he has no one to blame but
himself. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.Y. _ Darlington Castle was like a lover Donald Lehman
thought he could change: He coveted it despite its obvious flaw.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant turn-of-the-century stone mansion with its long,
winding drive, oak-paneled drawing rooms and view clear to the
World Trade Center, seems to sit on the top of the Earth. But the
castle also has a working radio tower mounted to its roof and an
iron-clad lease that insures it will remain there until 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who owns an alarm company, and his wife, Barbara, a
retired chemistry teacher, bought Darlington Castle and more than
30 acres of hillside for $1.5 million in 1993, substantially less
than similar houses in the area cost. In this town of old money,
new celebrity and sprawling estates 40 miles north of midtown
Manhattan, there were few other takers for a house with a 20-foot
antenna that broadcasts ``smooth jazz'' 24 hours a day to northern
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think about was the house,'' said Lehman, who
first visited it in 1983 when he tried to sell the previous owners
an alarm from his company, Attack Cat Security. ``It was my dream
house. The minute I saw it, I said, `I want this house.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Lehmans knew what they were getting into, they now
complain that Kenny G has become the soundtrack to their lives and
that the station, WZZN at 106.3 FM, comes through on every channel
on the radio dial, meddles with their television reception,
interrupts their fax machine and interferes with their business
equipment. Lehman attributes his headaches to microwave radiation
from the tower and the couple say the tower is ill-maintained,
causing their roof to leak and bathroom ceiling to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The station's owners see things differently. ``His claims range
from false to largely exaggerated,'' said Robert Davis, the lawyer
for WZZN, which is owned by Westchester Radio LLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our client, to buy some peace, has made many offers to
accommodate him,'' Davis said. The station has installed cable
television in five of the house's 17 rooms and pays the bill for
the service (about $100 a month). The station has given the Lehmans
two interference-free radios, two digital answering machines and
offered to pay half the cost of a new roof. The station is
obligated to pay about $5,000 a year in rent. It has offered to
increase the rent to $18,000, Davis said, and to install cable
television in the three-bedroom pool house. ``And by the way,''
Davis said. ``He paid $1.5 million for a house that's probably
worth 6 or 7 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lehmans are determined to be rid of the antenna.
</P>
<P>
   They have been arrested once for tampering with the transmitting
equipment. They have paid a $12,000 settlement to the radio company
and lost two court cases and an appeal to the Federal
Communications Commission to get rid of the antenna. A state
Supreme Court judge issued an injunction this summer to prevent
them from touching the equipment. They have been through four sets
of lawyers; the last ones resigned a few weeks ago, after the
Lehmans let it be known that they planned to tear the antenna down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll represent myself,'' Lehman said. ``I'm doing it my way.
It's time to have a Boston Tea Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle seems to be just another chapter in their home's
colorful history. Charles Darlington Jr., an economist and diplomat
whose father built Darlington Castle in 1904, fell upon hard times
in 1966. Neighbors say he lost all his money in a bad investment.
To generate enough income to keep the drafty castle in the family,
he sold off property and granted a 40-year lease to Martin Stone
for the tower.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who died in June, was the producer of ``Howdy Doody'' and
a pioneer in community radio. A lawyer by training, he drafted a
lease that has remained valid even though the castle has changed
ownership twice and the radio station has changed ownership four
times. ``It was a lease that was so one-sided that no one but a
desperate man would sign it,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   It turned the house into a white elephant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of buyers came to see it but nobody wanted that house,''
said Sally Siano, a real estate agent in Bedford Hills who
remembered when the house went on the market in the early 1990s for
more than $5 million. ``Every client I ever brought there would not
even consider living in it because of the electric fields and their
concern for their health,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Joy Schieffelin and her late husband, William Jay Schieffelin
III, a wine and spirit importer, bought Darlington Castle in 1975.
Like Lehman, Schieffelin was enamored with the castle and its
views. All the static that came through their television, radios
and stereo couldn't convince Schieffelin to move, his wife said,
though she was never comfortable there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lease was absolutely tight,'' Mrs. Schieffelin said sadly.
``There was nothing we could do about it. I don't know why we
stayed there except my husband loved that castle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schieffelin was friendly with Lehman, who regularly
serviced her security alarm. She knew how much Lehman wanted the
house and said that she warned him before he bought the property
that the lease was unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Don't worry, I'll get rid of that antenna,''' Mrs.
Schieffelin recalled in a telephone conversation. ``I said, `No,
you won't.' And he said, `Oh yes, I will.'''

THE MAN WHO BUILT THE COWBOYS IS ALIVE AND WELL; JUST ASK HIM

<P>
   He was the father of football's instant replay. He hired Tom
Landry. He originated the cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   The luxury boxes. The helmet with the star. The hole in the
roof.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Schramm did all that.
</P>
<P>
   When he was fired/resigned/left-in-a-huff one April day in 1989,
Schramm left behind one of sports' greatest success stories. The
Cowboys enjoyed 20 consecutive winning seasons during Schramm's
reign as president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys became a Thanksgiving tradition. They rose to be
named America's Team.
</P>
<P>
   Tex Schramm did all that.
</P>
<P>
   In the autumn of his 78th year, Schramm sits in his north Dallas
home and, if you prod him, reflects on four decades of NFL
memories.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a good sitter. Never was.
</P>
<P>
   Schramm is a doer. A dreamer. A man whose unique vision helped
pave the way for the NFL's rise to prominence.
</P>
<P>
   His back aches _ he's had three surgeries _ but his mind remains
sharp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know enough about what the league's problems are

who were outside of football who were always telling me what I
should do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I would do with the league now.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But since someone asked, Schramm wonders why instant
replay can't maintain a toehold. He thinks the salary cap is a good
idea gone bad. He thinks free agency will harm the game's
popularity. And don't get him started on the current commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Schramm always has spoken his mind, lest someone
speak it for him. Long before Jerry Jones fell in love with the TV
newsbite, Schramm was spin-doctoring the state of the Cowboys on
his weekly television and radio shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask Tex Schramm'', the radio show was called.
</P>
<P>
   And you still can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I appreciate most, I think, is how lucky I was to
come along at the time I did,'' Schramm said. ``The National
Football League was undergoing its biggest boom, its greatest
growth. Television was doing the same thing. They almost came up
together and, in some ways, were responsible for each other's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when I look at it today, I don't see the same picture.
Today it's a different game, a different life.'' `Too much ...
business'
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in the NFL, Schramm admits, is the money.
When the late Clint Murchison launched the expansion franchise in
Dallas in 1960, he paid the NFL $50,000 for the franchise and
$500,000 for the veteran players taken in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, Murchison's $550,000 investment would
be sold to Bum Bright for $60 million, who in turn would later sell
it to Jones for $147 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think today there is too much focus on the business aspects,
the money, than on the product, which is the game itself,'' Schramm
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up when people like George Halas and George
Preston Marshall were in the league, and their feeling was always
that the product _ the game _ had to be the No. 1 priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Without competitive balance, in other words, Schramm said he
believes that the NFL suffers. He cites the foundation-cementing
decision in 1961, when the league received its first network
contract, to share the TV revenue equally among all teams. Getting
the teams in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles to agree to the
deal, Schramm said, made the NFL what it became.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just saw where the New York Yankees signed a $500 million
cable contract,'' he said. ``They're going to get all the best
players. Is it any wonder why, in baseball, the teams with the
highest payrolls seem to have the best teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the theory of free agency cannot work in a team
sport. This isn't like boxing, where you have a heavyweight
champion, and everyone will pay to see someone fight the champ. In
football, you've got to have two people playing the game. You can't
have just a handful of good teams and the rest as a chorus line.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make the competition. You have to have a system in
which teams have the opportunity to be competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Schramm is aghast at what he has seen free agency do to
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you can have a sport and have somebody do what they did
to the Florida Marlins, that's a pretty bad commentary,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, Montreal sits up there, apparently with good
scouts and a good farm system. They bring them up, and as soon as
the guys show that they can play, they sell them for money.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, Schramm's own dynasty began to crumble, in the
mid-1980s. He himself could see it coming.
</P>
<P>
   He could see the age, not just in the veteran players but in
Landry's coaching staff. He could see the toll from so many years
of picking deep in the drafting order.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, according to others, Schramm was getting mixed
messages from Landry about the coach's quasi-impending retirement.
It was only after Landry suggested that Tex plan some sort of
orderly transition that Schramm, in 1986, hired Paul Hackett from
the San Francisco 49ers to be the Cowboys' new offensive
coordinator. Two seasons later, Hackett found his role being
increasingly diminished. One memorable Tuesday, Landry was standing
at his weekly news conference when he announced that, yes, he
planned to stay around for as long as it took to rebuild the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Schramm has never made a secret of what his plans had been. At
Super Bowl XXIII in Miami in January 1989 _ only weeks before the
world-inverting sale that Schramm and Landry never saw coming _ the
Cowboys' official party watched the game with an up-and-coming
young coach Schramm thought would make a promising successor to
Landry: Jimmy Johnson. `You can't sit back ... '
</P>
<P>
   Change comes, Schramm knows now. Nothing is forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think things are always going to be that way,'' he said.
``In my time it was pro football, but 50 years from now, there may
be something entirely different that is the No. 1 thing. Like
NASCAR _ look at these tracks and stadiums that they're building
now and all the money involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a different set of people growing up now that have
been raised on technology. What I'm saying is, you can't sit back
and think you've got the world by the tail, because that's what
baseball thought.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Schramm worries that the NFL is not taking care
of the details. When he was the loudest voice on the league's
then-powerful competition committee, the group would meet days
ahead of the annual regular NFL meetings. If the average score of
the average NFL game was falling, the committee would react to it.
If the games were running too long, the committee would recommend
ways to speed things up.
</P>
<P>
   Schramm wasn't shy about asking the NFL to, in effect, reinvent
itself every few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought the worst mistake you could make is not
recognizing that the times are changing and the players are
changing,'' Schramm said. ``You need to realize that 15, 20 years
from now, it's going to be hard to beat what you're going to be
able to see in your own home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a whole new generation. I don't think that
the youngster of today is going to tolerate some of the sports of
today. That's why you see things like skateboarding, rollerblading,
the X-Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sit back and say that these are the major sports
today and it's going to be that way forever, you're just not
looking at history.''
</P>
<P>
   Tex Schramm need not worry, however, about his own place in
history. In 1991, he was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame,
the first, as he puts it, ``of my kind'' to be so honored.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, however, Schramm remains the only one of the Cowboys'
seven Hall of Fame inductees who is not also enshrined in the
club's Ring of Honor. Jones, who fired Schramm _ or forced him to
resign, depending on which version of the story you've heard _ has
the ultimate say in that.
</P>
<P>
   It has been ``months and months'' since Schramm and Jones last
spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any idea why he would have any bitterness about
me,'' Schramm said, ``but I guess he does. In the 10 years, I've
never said anything derogatory about him in the media or about
anything that has happened. Though a lot of people wanted me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Schramm still attends Cowboys games, sitting in the same box
suite that he occupied when he was with the club. As part of his
severance agreement with Jones, Schramm was allowed to retain the
box for 10 years. Those 10 years will expire at the end of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Schramm and his wife, Marty, spend most of their time either
home or at their condominium in Key West, Fla. Tex appears happy,
but he confesses that there is a void in the couple's life.
</P>
<P>
   Their daughter, Mardee Schramm Smith, died in June 1997, from a
rare form of cancer. Mardee was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Tex calls her death ``more difficult than anything else I've
been involved with. To a father, there's nothing like a daughter.
To lose one is a very, very difficult thing to accept.'' `I'm not
the only nut ... '
</P>
<P>
   Down in Key West, Schramm can get away and absorb himself in his
other passion: marlin fishing. He doesn't keep and mount the big
fish, preferring to tag and release them instead.
</P>
<P>
   His latest venture in marlin-hunting is vintage Schramm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to catch a marlin fishing off the beach,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, Schramm has picked out a kite that will travel the
quarter-mile from the shoreline and drop his bait. He has picked
out the island in the Bahamas where, when the southeast wind blows
just right, the kite and its hook can slip out beyond the coral
reef.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm the only nut doing this,'' he said. ``I'm trying to be
the first one to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schramm has never been a good sitter, not even when he fishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the autumn of his 78th year, he prefers to remember the good
things, rather than the foul memories that ended his time with the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you one thing that makes me feel great,'' he said.
``When I go somewhere, people always come up and say, `Tex Schramm?
All I want to do is say thank you for a lot of great seasons and
great memories.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happened hundreds of times. In airports, wherever. And
it's amazing. It obviously makes me feel very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Let it be recorded that, other than his weakening back, The Man
Who Built the Cowboys is very much alive and well these days.
</P>
<P>
   He can still talk a little football. He can still talk a little
life.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Tex Schramm.

 &HT;    Brady Law gun checks expand to include rifles
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gun dealers' calls for instant background checks are
expected to quadruple in Georgia when the permanent Brady Law goes
into effect Monday, extending mandatory checks to anyone buying
rifles and shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   But gun shop owners don't expect to lose any business over the
expanded checks.
</P>
<P>
   For the last five years, the interim Brady Law has required
instant background checks before customers could take home newly
purchased handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The new law simply extends that coverage to rifles and shotguns.
Replica weapons _ chiefly muzzle-loading long guns and cap-and-ball
revolvers _ are still exempt as are holders of valid Georgia
concealed carry licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The permanent law, named after James Brady, who was seriously
wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald
Reagan, also requires pawnshops to run background checks on
customers redeeming pawned weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Severs, who directs the Georgia Bureau of Investigations'
firearms program, said the agency handled 89,109 calls for checks
last year. Of those, 83,673 led to sales of guns, while 7,136
triggered denials.
</P>
<P>
   Although sales records for long guns have never been kept,
Severs said they far exceed handgun sales. ``We're looking at
jumping up to 360,000 transactions next year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Lesher, owner of Chuck's Firearms in Buckhead, said,
``Georgia is very fortunate in that we go through the state for the
checks rather than the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia is one of 10 to 12 states with their own program he
said, predicting frequent delays, at least initially, in states
relying on the untried FBI system for checks. ``As a whole, the
state program we have is pretty good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be due in part to the state's contract with a Nashville
firm to install electronic instant-check terminals in all of
Georgia's high-volume gun dealers. Checks are conducted entirely
through the terminals, without tying up an operator at GBI
headquarters in DeKalb County, unless the computer flags a problem.
More than 100 of the terminals have been installed, Severs said.
They cost the dealer nothing, and the state pays the firm about
$2.50 per transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Licensed dealers at gun shows also are required to make instant
background checks. Such dealers would likely see little impact of a
five-day waiting period on sales at gun shows between nonlicensed
individuals. President Clinton said last weekend he wants to pursue
legislation requiring the waits.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Eastman, whose Eastman Gun Shows are the largest in
Georgia, said not all individuals who rent space at gun shows are
licensed firearms dealers; some are individuals seeking to sell all
or part of their collections. There is no law prohibiting private,
unreported gun sales, but Clinton contends many unlicensed dealers
at gun shows are violating various laws and perhaps selling stolen
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman, a member of the board of directors of the National Arms
Show Dealers, said there would be several ways to enact Clinton's
legislation without seriously disturbing gun shows, ranging from
forbidding unlicensed dealers to issuing short-term licenses so
that collectors can sell guns with background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Lesher, who deals in the highest quality sporting arms and sells
relatively few handguns, said he expects the expanded change to
have minimal impact on his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some initial shock for customers who didn't know
about it,'' he said, and computer snags could cause ``some
inconvenience for those used to buying their gun and walking right
out the door.'' The law provides that background checks take no
more than three business days.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Doss, a salesman at David's Gun Room in Gwinnett County,
agreed the law shouldn't hurt business. ``If anything, sales have
gone up'' during the five years of background checks on handguns,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Severs said the GBI uses temporary workers to handle calls to
the Georgia firearms Program Call Center, which is open from 8 a.m.
until 10 p.m. Monday through Saturday and 8 a.m.. to 6 p.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The temps also run initial computer checks, which sift through
state and federal databases for any criminal history, outstanding
warrants, or indications of involuntary hospital commitment. On
Nov. 30, the computer also will check the new National Instant
Criminal Background Check System, which Severs said will bring in
data from many federal sources.
</P>
<P>
   If a problem is detected, the operator hands the case to a
full-time GBI analyst to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer usually responds within 15 or 20 seconds,''
Severs said. ``If there's a problem, we're usually back in touch
with the dealer within an hour or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Severs said the new law will mean bringing the temp staff up to
about 30 and doubling the number of analysts from five to 10.
Buyers will continue to pay the $5 fee set by the Legislature for
the background check. It ``comes close'' to covering the costs,
Severs said. Last year, the state collected $368,710 in firearms
check fees.
</P>
<P>
   Well over half of those denied firearms in Georgia last year _
4,974 _ had been arrested on felony charges, but had no final
disposition of their cases yet. Convicted felons were denied 1,727
times, fugitives under felony warrants were denied 81 times and
individuals convicted of misdemeanor family violence were denied in
353 cases. Only one person was turned away for mental health
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Doss said he personally has never had a sale nullified by a
background check. But he voiced a common question: ``If 300,000
purchases were turned down all over the nation last year, why were
only a few of these people prosecuted? It's a felony to lie on the
application.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Killorin, special agent in charge of the Atlanta office of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the answer is
simple: ``The law was designed to prevent something from happening,
rather than to put a number of prosecutions on an already heavy
federal court document. However, I would expect to see more
prosecutions of this kind in the future.

 &HT;    Culture clash: Chicagoan in Starr light
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ David Schippers is known as a bare-knuckled
attorney, the man who slapped handcuffs on Chicago mobster Sam
Giancana as a 30-year-old federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to asking independent counsel Kenneth Starr
questions about his investigation of President Clinton, Schippers
turned soft.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than establish facts in the case against the president,
Schippers last week asked Starr questions that allowed the
prosecutor to try to rehabilitate himself before a national
television audience that has grown tired of the whole scandal. At
the end of 30 minutes of questioning, Republican members of the
committee and some of those in the audience stood and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   As he walked out of the Rayburn Office Building that night,
Schippers turned and grinned. ``The highlight of the night was the
standing ovation for Ken Starr,'' said the born and bred Chicago
Democrat. ``The man deserves that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no disputing that the posh House Judiciary Committee
chamber on Capitol Hill is a far different forum from the
black-and-white world of the federal courthouse where Schippers
once took down mobsters or the county courthouse where Schippers
more recently has defended the likes of a serial killer and a porn
star named Seka.
</P>
<P>
   But as the committee continues its impeachment hearings Tuesday
to debate the consequences of perjury, the real question is: Can
Schippers pull it off?
</P>
<P>
   Can this salty Chicagoan, stocky in his signature drab brown
suits, beat back the polished presidential defense team?
</P>
<P>
   Friends defend the way Schippers questioned Starr and argue that
he brings a much needed outsider's perspective to Washington. He
has a finely tuned moral compass and a Midwestern directness for
the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows they trade horses for cows in Washington all the
time,'' said Peter Vaira, former U.S. attorney of Philadelphia, who
knows Schippers from Chicago when he ran an organized crime strike
force under the direction of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F.
Kennedy. ``He is going to tell them what he thinks. They might not
like it, but it will be the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Catholic world of Schippers, who spent five years
studying the priesthood before he met his wife, few things are
worse than lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes lying is a major transgression,'' said David
Schippers Jr., his eldest son, recalling a childhood episode in
which his father caught him lying about smoking cigarettes and was
more concerned about his not telling the truth than his smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could do anything wrong growing up, but if you lied, you
really had it,'' the younger Schippers said. ``To him, it requires
severe consequences when you lie _ and it doesn't matter if you're
a Democrat or a Republican doing the lying.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good because the other axiom the senior Schippers
instilled in each of his 10 children and 25 grandchildren is this:
``There are three things you should never bet against: God, the
Democratic Party and the Chicago White Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat with prosecutor's heart
</P>
<P>
   Schippers, who has voted for Clinton twice, is proud of his
Democratic lineage.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of northwest Chicago, Schippers was a regular at the
45th Ward Democratic headquarters, taking his children there to
celebrate election night with the same vigor he used to steer them
to Mass. Twenty years ago, he even ran on the Democratic ticket to
be Cook County sheriff, a job that for Chicago politicians is more
about patronage than law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is first cousin Tom Lyons, who runs the Cook
County Democratic Party, arguably one of the most powerful of the
party's strongholds given its storied machine-like way of turning
out the Democratic vote.
</P>
<P>
   On its face, it would seem odd that Schippers, a 68-year-old
Democrat at the twilight of a distinguished legal career, is
running an impeachment investigation for a conservative Republican
like Henry Hyde of Illinois, who heads the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Just how did Hyde lure Schippers to Washington in the first
place?
</P>
<P>
   The two began a casual friendship years ago when they served on
the Illinois Legislative Crime Investigation Committee when Hyde
was a state representative. They renewed that bond three years ago
when both were sworn in as papal knights in the Equestrian Order of
the Holy Sepulcher by the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin.
</P>
<P>
   By choosing Schippers as lead counsel, Hyde may have thought he
was heading off charges of partisanship while bringing aboard a
lawyer with knowledge of the intricacies of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, Schippers helped write an article that reviewed the
impeachment inquiry against President Richard Nixon and concluded
the evidence suggested that Nixon may have been guilty of
subornation of perjury (asking someone to lie under oath) and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   But, above all else, Schippers, who will be paid $130,000
annually in his government job, is a relentless prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dave's a prosecutor at heart. He will follow the evidence
wherever it goes,'' said Lyons, his Democratic cousin. ``I just
don't happen to agree where it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   `Nothing but the truth'
</P>
<P>
   When Starr's 445-page report arrived Sept. 9 on Capitol Hill,
Schippers told reporters the inquiry would be bipartisan and free
of the political tirades that commonly occur on Capitol Hill.
``This is going to be bipartisan,'' Schippers said. ``I'm a proud
Democrat, but I'm a lawyer and human being first. I will call it as
I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   One month later, Schippers announced there was ``substantial and
credible evidence'' that Clinton committed 15 impeachable crimes,
but Schippers did so without calling a single witness to confirm or
deny the 18 boxes of evidence accompanying Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone wondering what Schippers thinks about the merits of the
Starr report need look no further than what he told the Judiciary
Committee panel last month when he announced the 15 impeachable
offenses for which he believed there were grounds for
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle that every witness in every case must tell the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth is the foundation
of the American system of justice,'' Schippers said. ``If lying
under oath is tolerated and, when exposed, is not visited with
immediate and substantial adverse consequences, the integrity of
this country's entire judicial process is fatally compromised and
that process will inevitably collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Judiciary Committee Democrats argue that lying about sex
should not be placed in the same category as committing bribery,
treason or high crimes and misdemeanors. The Clinton case focuses
on lying about sex, not about state secrets, Democrats say.
</P>
<P>
   But Schippers sees it differently. ``The subject matter of the
underlying case, whether civil or criminal, and the circumstances
under which the testimony is given are of no significance
whatever,'' he told the committee. ``It is the oath itself that is
sacred and must be enforced.''
</P>
<P>
   As chief counsel, Schippers has said his role is to follow the
facts wherever they may lead. But Democrats contend he has
delivered his opinion long before the facts were known and
challenged. That can be seen, they say, in his final statement to
the committee, in which he paraphrased Sir Thomas More from the
famous play about his life. ``The laws of this country are the
great barriers that protect the citizens from the winds of evil and
tyranny,'' he said. ``If we permit one of those walls to fall, who
will be able to stand in the winds that follow?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if he were closing a case, Schippers looked hard at the
committee members. ``You are not being watched only by the
individuals in this room or even by the immense television audience
throughout the world. Fifteen generations of Americans, our fellow
Americans, are looking down on and judging what you do today,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, his friends say, is classic Schippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man is exceptionally hard working and his integrity is
beyond reproach,'' said Raymond McKoski, the chief judge of Lake
County, Ill., who as a young state attorney prosecuted Larry Eyler,
a serial killer who was defended by Schippers. ``You could rely on
his word. He never tried to shade or color what he was saying.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are times when Schippers' comments seem calculated for
effect. At a news conference after his speech to the committee,
Schippers joked to the Washington media that he wished his
Styrofoam cup had ``some gin in it,'' as he sure could use some.
(He neglected to say he is a teetotaler.)
</P>
<P>
   And even after delivering a speech so offensive to Democrats
that they had it stricken from the record, Schippers told reporters
he had no preconceived belief about the president's guilt or
innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I understood my role, it was to take the referral given to
me, examine all the evidence and then come up with an independent
judgment in what thaed with Schippers on the strike force.
``Washington isn't ready for Dave Schippers because Washington as a
whole is filled with corruption, it is a cesspool of corruption,
and Dave Schippers is going to go in and make mincemeat out of
these high-priced attorneys.''

NBA MIGHT BORROW A PAGE FROM NHL GUIDE TO LABOR STRIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was name-calling and bitter mistrust and times when the
two sides would sulk in silence. There were concerns about fan
alienation and irreparable rifts, and moments when the season
looked lost.
</P>
<P>
   This scene does not refer to the National Basketball
Association's current lockout, but to the labor strife that nearly
resulted in the cancellation of the National Hockey League's
1994-95 season. In the end, after a grueling and emotional 48-hour
session to save the season as the fail-safe deadline passed, the
insults that had been aimed at one another for five months were no
more fatal than shots fired in a game of paint ball. Just colorful
rhetoric for the sake of one contentious game: labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   To some in the National Basketball Players Association, the
course the NHL took in ending its lockout and reaching an 11th-hour
agreement with its players in January 1995 has provided a blueprint
for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beginning to play out that way,'' said one union
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``I don't think
it's a coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   One main reason for the union's suspicion lies in the
relationship between NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and NBA
commissioner David Stern. For years, Stern was Bettman's mentor in
the NBA. Then Bettman departed the league five years ago with some
of what he had gleaned from Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Bettman was off to put the NHL on the pop charts. Two
years later, a grim lockout left wounds on both sides, but ended
under an ultimatum: Get an agreement or else the season is
canceled. Under that pressure, a deal was struck that left both
sides relieved, but was viewed to favor the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners moved inches, and we moved football fields,''
defenseman Tommy Albelin said when the deal was agreed to on the
103rd day of the NHL lockout, Jan. 11, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So far, as the NBA lockout moves into its 152nd day Sunday,
Stern has refused to set a deadline, which union officials have
been asking for in recent weeks in order to know what they are up
against.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no deadline yet, there are notable similarities
in the issues that faced the NHL and now the NBA. What to do with
the season? After its lockout ended, the NHL put into motion a
48-game reduced schedule and lengthened the regular season. The NBA
has discussed a similar scenario. How long can the current
stalemate last? In the NHL, a month of silence passed between a
Dec. 6 meeting and the ones leading to a settlement in January. The
last bargaining session in the NBA was 10 days ago, with no new
meetings scheduled. How do the players feel? As with the NHL, the
players in the NBA have an attitude reflective of Albelin's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players feel like we have given up too much already,''
said a union spokesman, Dan Wasserman. ``They keep giving and
giving.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the players have offered the following: a decrease in
the maximum raise on multiyear contracts to 10 percent from 20
percent, a fourth year to the rookie wage scale, a luxury tax on
superstars making $15 million salaries and an agreement on the
framework of an escrow plan.
</P>
<P>
   But then something happened along the way to progress. After a
10-hour session on Nov. 20, a couple of days passed and a
misunderstanding grew over what was agreed to by the union.
Suspecting that the union was reneging on its word, the league
canceled a bargaining session that had been scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   During the past week of discord, the union has insisted on its
desired percentage of basketball-related revenues. The union does
not intend to budge off 57 percent, well above the 51.8 percent
figure that allowed the owners to reopen the collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not practical, but that's the position they've taken,''
Russ Granik, the deputy commissioner, said Saturday. ``They want at
least as good a deal as last time. Unfortunately, the way it worked
out is that the players had too good of a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the league sees some hint of flexibility, the stalemate is
expected to continue. Perhaps the NBA's labor strife will end as it
did in the NHL. As January came, and a deadline was set, the fear
of losing the season began to unsettle the players and the owners.
That fear motivated them to overcome the hostility and get a deal
done.
</P>
<P>
   If and when a deadline is set for the NBA, there is the
expectation that a marathon session of bargaining will commence. As
one union official put it, the waiting would be over and the
players could find out whether a deal could be struck.
</P>
<P>
   But any reliance on the NHL blueprint can be perilous. What if
Stern continues his reluctance to lay down a threat by setting a
deadline and, without warning, decides to cancel the season? What
if the owners, some of whom are willing to forgo the season now,
are not posturing?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea what they are waiting for or what their
strategy is,'' Granik said. ``We're not going to set a deadline
because that sounds like an ultimatum. Either we will make a deal
or we won't. Our strategy is very simple: We need a deal that is
fair to the owners. If we have it, we play basketball. If we don't
have it, we won't. There's no hocus-pocus. There's no magic to it.
We'd much prefer to negotiate the deal now rather than later.''

CONVERTING OBSOLETE CHICAGO HOSPITALS TO HOUSING
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By JILL SCHACHNER CHANEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Residential conversion has become the prescription of
choice for some failing hospitals in Chicago, and now another
hospital is taking the cure.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, at least four unprofitable hospitals have
been converted into loft apartments, and several others in prime
locations were sold and razed as a result of consolidations in the
health-care field, making way for upscale developments.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first hospitals in Chicago to be converted to
residences was the Manchester Lofts in 1990, a renovation of a
110-year-old hospital in the Near West Side. Closed for many years,
it first became a light manufacturing facility and then artists'
studios before being renovated into 18 loft apartments.
</P>
<P>
   The latest hospital to undergo such a transformation is Chicago
Osteopathic Medical Center in the Hyde Park neighborhood on the
city's South Side. It had belonged to the Nashville-based
HCA/Columbia health-care chain and was sold as part of the
company's reorganization plan, said Jeff Prescott, spokesman for
the chain.
</P>
<P>
   When the $50-million transformation is complete sometime next
fall, the hospital and its grounds will be turned into a
residential development with 225 loft apartments, 28 town houses
and 16 detached houses in a complex to be called Renaissance Place.
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the 13 hospital buildings on Chicago
Osteopathic's campus were shuttered when HCA/Columbia began
searching for a new owner. A clinic continues to operate in the
remaining one and is not scheduled to close until next summer, when
it will be demolished as part of the construction plan, said Roger
Mankedick, executive vice president for sales and marketing for
Concord Development Corp. of Chicago, which is developing the
project with Kenard Corp., also of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sales and construction are scheduled to begin by the end of the
year. The loft apartments, which will range in size from 800 to
1,400 square feet, will be priced from about $100,000 to $150,000.
Two-bedroom town houses will be priced at about $240,000, and the
detached homes, which will range in size from 2,400 to 3,000 square
feet and offer three to four bedrooms, will be priced from
$350,000, said Mankedick.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The developers, who paid $5.8 million for the property, plan to
renovate two of the hospital buildings into the lofts. The other
buildings, which are not suitable for re-use, will be razed to make
room for the construction of a two-story parking structure, the
town-house condominiums and green space, said project architect
Patrick FitzGerald of FitzGerald Associates in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   FitzGerald said many of the hospital buildings were not
adaptable for residential space because they were below grade or
had no windows. Others, like an auditorium, were not economically
feasible to renovate.
</P>
<P>
   The two buildings that will be converted into apartments will
still require substantial demolition. FitzGerald said several
additions have to be removed. ``Institutional buildings and in
particular hospital buildings tend to grow over time by additions
and remodeling,'' he said. ``We thought that by peeling back some
of the additions we could make the old space new and then by
demolishing the others we could do the new construction.''
</P>
<P>
   The detached houses will be built on a parcel of land two blocks
from the main campus, which was also part of the hospital property.
</P>
<P>
   Mankedick said he expected many of the buyers to come from the
neighborhood, home to the University of Chicago, where there is an
abundance of rental apartments and high-priced historic homes, but
little moderate-cost new construction, Mankedick said.
</P>
<P>
   The conversion of hospitals into residential developments is
happening on a case-by-case basis, said J. Philip Lathrop, a
health-care consultant who is a vice president at Booz Allen &AMP;
Hamilton, a management consultant firm with an office here.
</P>
<P>
   Most health-care companies try to sell unprofitable hospitals as
a going concern to other operators to yield the greatest return.
But in Chicago, many of the older hospitals are either obsolete or
too inappropriately located to be upgraded as hospitals. ``Selling
to a real estate developer is a default,'' Lathrop noted.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, several other Chicago hospitals, closed
due to declining revenues and too many beds, have been sold to
residential developers, most of whom buy the properties for their
land only.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Chicago's MCL Cos. razed the former Henrotin
Hospital on the city's Gold Coast and the former Augustana Hospital
in Lincoln Park to build upscale condominium apartments and town
houses.
</P>
<P>
   FitzGerald said many developers prefer demolition of the
hospital buildings over renovation because of the building
structure. Hospitals typically were built with no thought of
adaptive re-use. ``There are lots of small rooms with closely
spaced columns, which do not allow the same degree of flexibility
that a large bay structure does,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the mechanical systems are complex. Piping for
sterile water, oxygen and communication lines are built into the
walls and are costly to remove. Interior walls can be as thick as
22 inches and require masonry saws to tear down.
</P>
<P>
   The demolition costs for converting hospitals tend to be
significantly higher than any other type of conversion for loft
space, making the purchase price for the property a key factor in
the ultimate sales price of the completed units, FitzGerald said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the developers of Renaissance Place was not deterred by
the challenge because it was his second conversion of a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The first one, called Columbus on the Park, involved the
renovation last year of St. Francis Xavier Cabrini Hospital near
the Chicago campus of the University of Illinois on the city's West
Side. The nearly 90-year-old hospital was renovated into 105 loft
apartments, and 28 town houses were built on what had been the
hospital parking lot, said Harold Lichterman, president of Kenard,
the developer.
</P>
<P>
   The units, priced from $80,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to
$350,000 for a three-bedroom town house, were sold out in seven
months, Lichterman said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Catholic Health Partners in Chicago, which sold
St. Francis Xavier Cabrini Hospital to Kenard, declined to comment
on the reasons behind the sale. But Anthony Smaniotto, first vice
president for investment properties at CB Richard Ellis in Chicago,
who handled the sale for the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred
Heart, which owned the hospital, said fewer than 40 percent of beds
were being used at the time of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Kenard, he said, was the only developer bidding on the property
that did not plan to demolish the hospital. Preservation of the
hospital building was important to the owners because they wanted
to leave a legacy of their work in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to preserving the hospital building for Columbus on
the Park, some of the hospital's original ornamentation also was
kept, including the entrance and several interior hallways
decorated with glazed clay tile.
</P>
<P>
   FitzGerald, who also designed Columbus on the Park, said
preservation of the St. Francis Xavier Cabrini Hospital building
was just as important to the developer as it was to the owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who lives there knows some of the history of the
building,'' he said.

 &HT;    Tossing coins
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The coin-toss blunder by referee Phil Luckett on
Thursday might go down as one of the biggest gaffes in league
history. But there have probably been more famous coin tosses in
the annals of professional football. In the '62 AFL championship
game, Dallas Texans tailback Abner Haynes opted to kick off after
winning an overtime coin toss. Pittsburgh owner Art Rooney won the
rights to quarterback Terry Bradshaw in the '70 draft via a coin
toss, and the Steelers won four Super Bowls under his direction. A
few years ago, New England linebacker Vincent Brown had to correct
the referee on the pregame coin toss. Just before the '63 AFL
season, the San Diego Chargers and Denver Broncos both claimed
rights to quarterback Tobin Rote, who was returning from a stint in
the CFL. Chargers coach Sid Gillman won a coin toss with
counterpart Jack Faulkner for Rote. He teamed with wide receiver
Lance Alworth to provide the Chargers an explosive passing attack
and they went on to capture the '63 AFL championship.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert to Seahawks?
</P>
<P>
   Seattle owner Paul Allen and team president Bob Whitsitt are
increasingly impressed by the work of vice president of football
operations Randy Mueller. That could mean the Seahawks won't pursue
Green Bay's Mike Holmgren for the combined post of coach-GM. Under
such a scenario, the man topping Seattle's wish-list to succeed
Dennis Erickson probably would be former San Francisco coach George
Seifert. With the odds improving on June Jones keeping the job in
San Diego, which is what GM Bobby Beathard hopes for, the position
that could most interest Holmgren now might be with the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe hurting
</P>
<P>
   Unless a fractured right index finger improves this morning, New
England quarterback Drew Bledsoe won't be able to start today
against Buffalo. Bledsoe was unable to work on Friday and
seventh-year veteran Scott Zolak took all the snaps with the No. 1
unit. Zolak has started only five games in his career, none since
1995. Embattled coach Pete Carroll had hoped a red-hot Bledsoe and
the return to health of wide receiver Terry Glenn might spark his
team during the December stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   Dripping with irony
</P>
<P>
   With owner Bob Kraft poised to move the Patriots to Hartford,
Conn., the media in the Boston area spent much of the week seeking
a quote from his past that might cast him in a bad light. They came
up with this childhood memory by Kraft, a Boston native, on the
relocation of baseball's Boston Braves to Milwaukee: ``They were my
team. To this day, I regret that they left. A part of me died on
that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Colts clobbered
</P>
<P>
   The Colts return to Baltimore today for the first time since
abandoning the city in 1984, and many former players from the
city's storied NFL history will be on hand to witness what they
hope will be sweet revenge. ``If (the Ravens) win by 100, it won't
be enough, but it will be some measure of vindication,''
quarterback Johnny Unitas said. Former Colts players insisted that
their ire is somewhat assuaged by the fact owner Robert Irsay has
died, but they still harbor a deep grudge. Hall of Fame defensive
tackle Art Donovan noted that the New York Jets will wear a decal
on their helmets in memory of coach Weeb Ewbank, who died two weeks
ago. ``Weeb coached the Colts, too,'' Donovan said. ``But that team
can't wear a decal honoring him. He was part of this city's
heritage, and he'd roll over in his grave if these Colts tried to
claim him as one of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Eric Allen (knee) for the season has ended the
experiment with Oakland corner Charles Woodson learning some
wide-receiver plays.

 &HT;    Calls hardly heads-up
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For years, NFL coaches and talent scouts have had a
saying: The tape doesn't lie.
</P>
<P>
   The reference, of course, is to videotape, that celluloid stuff
that is to player analysis what Ace bandages are to sprained
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   But unless your name is Richard Nixon and Rosemary Woods is your
secretary, the audiotape usually doesn't fib, either. League
officials might keep that in mind when they begin to dissect the
Thanksgiving Day snafu now known as Coin-flipgate.
</P>
<P>
   The incredible gaffe by referee Phil Luckett at the beginning of
overtime in the contest between the Steelers and Lions imperfectly
culminated an afternoon of dubious decisions that infuriated both
coaches. In front of a national TV audience, Steelers fullback
Jerome Bettis called out, ``Tails!'' and Luckett somehow heard,
``Heads!'' For those who haven't yet seen replays, the coin landed
tails-side up.
</P>
<P>
   Resurrecting the old ``Heads-they-win-and-tails-you-lose''
routine, Luckett awarded the option to the Lions, victimized most
of the day by poor officiating calls. Detroit defensive end Robert
Porcher quit snickering long enough to decide that his team would
receive.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pittsburgh radio station KDKA on Saturday denied
a report that it had an enhanced audio with an unidentified voice
saying, ``Heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lions took the kickoff, drove to Jason Hanson's game-winning
field goal, then hustled home to give thanks for the greatest
makeup call in league history. The Steelers, beneficiaries of at
least three questionable decisions, should have won in regulation
but still didn't deserve to lose on such an oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Even on Friday afternoon, Porcher had trouble stifling his
laughter. ``All I'm saying is, `Happy Thanksgiving, everybody,'''
Porcher said.
</P>
<P>
   Happy for everybody, that is, except NFL officials, who now must
deal with this holiday leftover. Even on a day off, NFL vice
president Greg Aiello was hounded at home Friday by reporters and
fans seeking answers and offering solutions. One fan suggested
using coin-flip flip-cards reading ``heads'' and ``tails'' that the
captain would hand the referee while the coin is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Aiello confirmed that the coin flip will be reviewed but, with
supervisor of officials Jerry Seeman out of the office until
Monday, nothing is imminent. Aiello said, ``Just when you think
you've seen it all ...''
</P>
<P>
   What coaches, players and fans have seen too much of this season
is poor officiating. For the first time in several years, it's
possible to argue a viable case that officials have decided the
outcomes of some games.
</P>
<P>
   Already the mistake by Luckett has refueled the passions of
instant-replay advocates. But the coin toss would not have come
under the purview of any of their recent replay proposals. Instead,
for those who recall the movie ``The Conversation,'' figuring out
the Luckett error conjures up mental images of Gene Hackman huddled
in a nondescript van and wearing a headset.
</P>
<P>
   Given the poor performance of game officials, replay represents
only part of a solution. Officials must be held accountable,
sanctioned when necessary. Seeman, the mother hen who is so
defensive, also must be scrutinized. There is no quick fix, but a
game that's become too quick for some aging officials deserves a
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   League officials hinted Friday that Luckett faces sanction,
perhaps a one-game suspension, if a review upholds Bettis'
contention.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the attention on Luckett's call might reinforce
a notion shared by many coaches: Officials might be called
``zebras'' because of the striped shirts, but on Thanksgiving
afternoon they looked more like turkeys.

 &HT;    Packers search for coach
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After saying that Mike Holmgren probably will be
coaching elsewhere in 1999, Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf
conceded that at some point, he might have to begin looking at
Packers assistants and those around the league in a different
light. ``I guess there will come a time when I have to view them
(as possible replacements),'' he said. ``But before I do, I want to
convince myself we've exhausted every opportunity to bring Mike
back here.'' It's a good bet that Wolf already has compiled a short
list, and it probably includes current Packers aides Sherman Lewis
(offensive coordinator) and Andy Reid (quarterbacks), along with
Eagles coach Ray Rhodes. Rumored not to be on Wolf's wish-list is
San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci, who's negotating a contract
extension with the 49ers, and Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering no Moss
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after his three-touchdown performance against Dallas on
Thanksgiving Day, the first chink appeared in the armor of
Minnesota wideout Randy Moss. The Vikings rookie star agreed to a
post-game interview with Fox analyst John Madden, then blew off the
rest of the media, many of them national reporters who covered the
game just because of him. Coach Dennis Green condoned the action,
rationalizing that Moss ``only caught three passes.'' Of course,
they were for TDs of 51, 51 and 56 yards. With wide receiver Jake
Reed (back) out for a month and tailback Robert Smith (knee) down
for at least two weeks, Moss figures to become even more central to
the offense. He'd better get used to attention, because quarterback
Randall Cunningham and coordinator Brian Billick are going to force
the ball to him.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves leads voting
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons' Dan Reeves, whose resurrection of a
moribund franchise figures to make him a prime contender for coach
of the year, already leads in one such poll. Since Nov. 1, the
league's Internet site (www.nfl.com) has been conducting balloting
for Staples coach of the year honors. Reeves holds a slight lead on
Green, Mike Shanahan (Denver), Jon Gruden (Oakland) and Chan Gailey
(Dallas).
</P>
<P>
   Secondary matters
</P>
<P>
   An already-ailing Green Bay secondary figures to be paper-thin
for today's matchup with Philadelphia. If neither Craig Newsome nor
Rod Smith can line up, Darren Sharper will move from free safety to
left cornerback. Pat Terrell would replace Sharper at free safety,
and Mike Prior, who has been ineffective lately, probably would
play in most nickel situations. ``We're into the cut-and-paste
mode,'' coordinator Fritz Shurmur said.
</P>
<P>
   Flying high
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly a half-season, but Arizona's Jake Plummer finally
has grasped the West Coast-style scheme installed by first-year
coordinator Marc Trestman and it could mean the Cardinals' first
playoff berth in a non-strike year since 1975. Plummer is more
relaxed now that Trestman has allowed him to use the no-huddle
more, and wide receivers Frank Sanders and Rob Moore are excellent
at reading his ad-lib moves. ``They're a scary offense when
(Plummer) starts drawing up plays in the dirt,'' Dallas defensive
coordinator Dave Campo said.
</P>
<P>
   Steep price
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta officials have indicated that they could have a tough
time paying tailback Jamal Anderson more than the $5.4 million a
year being earned by quarterback Chris Chandler. Getting a contract
extension, then, could be sticky. According to NFLPA figures, the
top six highest-paid tailbacks _ Curtis Martin (Jets), Terrell
Davis (Broncos), Dorsey Levens (Packers), Robert Smith (Vikings),
Emmitt Smith (Cowboys) and Barry Sanders (Lions) _ average about
$5.3 million.

 &HT;    Two-minute drill with Vikings' Brian Billick
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Subject: Minnesota Vikings offensive coordinator Brian Billick.
</P>
<P>
   Topic: Scripting a game plan.
</P>
<P>
   Background: After 13 years as a college assistant, Billick
joined coach Dennis Green's staff in 1992 and was elevated to
coordinator midway through the '93 season. In his four full
seasons, the Vikings' offense has ranked No. 8 or better three
times and never been lower than 12th. Billick, 44, uses extensive
computer analyses to formulate the game plan and typically will
``script'' the first 15-20 plays.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How does your scripting perhaps differ from that of Mike
Holmgren in Green Bay or San Francisco's Steve Mariucci?
</P>
<P>
   A: Many coaches who script the first few series will decide,
'OK, this is what we want on the first play (of the game), and then
we'll come back with this on the second snap.' We script more for
down and distance, with two or three plays for each scenario.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the early stages of a game, how much does a variety of
formations allow you to ascertain what a defense is doing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Diversity of formation is a big key. We'll put, say, (wide
receiver) Randy Moss in the slot to see how the defense will react.
The next time, we'll have him out wide just to get a feel for what
the defense will do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you use that knowledge later in the game?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can look at the Polaroid shots and see how a defense
responds to a certain look. That may narrow or expand the range of
calls available to you. It affords you guidelines on situational
options.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON . . .
</P>
<P>
   Veterans: San Diego leads the NFL in defense against the run,
but it faces the ultimate test in Denver tailback Terrell Davis. To
contain Davis, the Chargers will need strong outings by linebacker
Junior Seau and strong safety Rodney Harrison, who will play up
close to the line.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie: Former Vanderbilt star Corey Chavous was drafted as a
safety by Arizona, but with oft-injured Tom Knight again sidelined,
Chavous starts today at cornerback. With Aeneas Williams on the
opposite side, Chavous figures to see plenty of passes thrown his
way by Kansas City quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Free agent: The rumors are that Seattle quarterback Warren Moon
either will retire or be released after the season. Two-year
veteran John Kitna gets his second career start today, and it
serves in part as an audition for the future. He could battle John
Friesz for the starter's spot in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Coach: The Ravens' Ted Marchibroda coached the Colts both in
Baltimore (1975-79) and Indianapolis (1992-95). Today, he's under
pressure from fans with long memories to vanquish the much-despised
Colts, who under the stewardship of late owner Bob Irsay exited
Baltimore in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   TIP SHEET
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Schiller of Turner Sports and Dick Ebersol of NBC should
announce within two weeks that their new football league will begin
play in June 2000. ... One AFC West team mulling a coaching change
has begun gauging interest of Florida's Steve Spurrier. ...
Tailback Lawrence Phillips, a two-time loser in the NFL, will try
to resurrect his career in the World League. ... University of
Washington quarterback Brock Huard, a junior who nearly left after
the '97 season, already has filed the papers to make him eligible
for the '99 draft. ... Falcons backup quarterback Steve DeBerg was
pulled over for speeding recently on I-85, but his blood-alcohol
level was barely under the state's .08 limit for DUI. ... Kansas
City insiders insist that coach Marty Schottenheimer will be back
in '99, but they aren't so sure about linebacker Derrick Thomas.
... St. Louis personnel director Charley Armey is under even more
fire than coach Dick Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   Former Vikings coach Jerry Burns has offered to be a bone-marrow
donor for Iowa aide Bob Elliott, who suffers from a clotting
disorder. Elliott is son of longtime Hawkeyes AD Bump Elliott and,
before his illness, thought to be a possible successor to Hayden
Fry.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Not even being under the thumb of Jets coach Bill Parcells could
halt the bad behavior of linebacker Bryan Cox. Cox was fined
$10,000 for roughness against Oilers quarterback Steve McNair,
then, typically, charged the NFL with racism.
</P>
<P>
   THE LIST
</P>
<P>
   Despite going onto injured reserve after the third game of the
season, tailback Greg Hill (fibula) continues to lead the St. Louis
Rams in rushing with 240 yards. Here are the players since 1970 who
have led their teams in rushing with fewer than 350 yards:
</P>
<P>
   Yards Player Team Year
</P>
<P>
   229 Ross Montgomery Bears 1970
</P>
<P>
   261 Jeff Queen Chargers 1970

<P>
   311 Michael Haddix Packers 1990

</P>
<P>
   337 Tony Baker Saints 1970
</P>
<P>
   344 Bobby Duhon Giants 1971
</P>
<P>
   STAT OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the '96 season, free safety Brock Marion
has played in 37 games, all starts, first for Dallas and now Miami.
The six-year pro has earned $4.69 million in that period but has
zero interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Quotable
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre on the return to practice of
tailback Dorsey Levens and wideout Derrick Mayes: ``No one's a
savior. And no one knows that better than me.''

 &HT;    Banks hobbling but game
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ His career has been a flash of brilliance one week,
a glimpse of ineptitude the next. But one thing that can be said
about St. Louis Rams quarterback Tony Banks: He always shows up for
work.
</P>
<P>
   Banks will start his 41st consecutive game this afternoon at the
Trans World Dome against the Falcons, a streak that places him
fourth among active quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   With 104 straight appearances opening games, Brett Favre of
Green Bay leads the list. Next is Tampa Bay's Trent Dilfer with 59
and New England's Drew Bledsoe with 44. And then there is Banks.
</P>
<P>
   His availability for the Atlanta game was questionable because
of a sore right ankle suffered in last week's loss to the Carolina
Panthers. However, Banks practiced with the team Thursday,
prompting optimism from coach Dick Vermeil.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked fine,'' Vermeil said. ``He threw the ball well.
He'll start.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't ask him to move a lot, but he did all his drop-back
stuff and roll-out stuff. He's a tough guy.''
</P>
<P>
   With an offensive line that is young and inconsistent, Banks has
taken a beating from aggressive pass rushers. ``He's taken probably
more shots than all of them,'' Vermeil said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks did not practice Wednesday, but did during a light workout
on Thanksgiving Day. He reported some stiffness and tenderness when
making some moves. Still, it's not enough to keep him from
starting.
</P>
<P>
   However, with his mobility limited, Banks, a fleet-footed sort
who can break off a big run with his deft ability to escape the
pocket, said he'll be more of a pocket passer against the Falcons
than a roll-out one. The game plan doesn't call for as many
rollouts and bootlegs. ``Atlanta took that away from us last time
we played them anyway,'' he said. ``So they're ready for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Falcons certainly would like to put
pressure on Banks as much as possible, the thinking being to make
him run or make a decision while hobbling. Still, Banks insists he
will not force the ball into coverage just to get rid of it before
a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my ankle's bothering me, probably I will have to change
some things,'' Banks said. ``But if it's just a little pain and I
can play through it, I'll try to make some plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup Steve Bono, a former 49er, will play if Banks can't.

 &HT;    The Reeves difference: Quality upgrade
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Whenever he's on his way to a road game, Atlanta
Falcons coach Dan Reeves always flies first class. This season,
he's trying to make sure that players get an upgrade, too.
</P>
<P>
   At Reeves' urging, John Knox, administrative assistant/finance
for the Falcons, ordered bigger planes for most of this season's
road trips, a concession to the average size of NFL players and an
attempt to reward them for their work.
</P>
<P>
   In years past, the Falcons would charter Boeing 727s for most
games, and move up to a Boeing 757 _ which is more expensive _ for
long trips to the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Both planes have three seats on both sides of the aisle, but
seats in the 757 are wider by a few inches, and there are more of
them. Also, there are 24 first class seats in a 757, to 12 in a
727.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes a big difference,'' linebacker Cornelius Bennett
said. ``Those couple hours we spend on the plane are valuable time.
You get somebody with a sore shoulder or something and you get
cramped up on a plane and something can swell up.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Reeves decided a long time ago to try to make life
easier on the road, and, for that matter, at home.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of the few coaches who doesn't require players to
check into a hotel the night before home games. Also, whether at
home or on the road, he schedules no meeting the night before
games, when almost every other team meets. Instead, those meetings
are held the morning of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought (staying in a hotel the night before home
games) accomplished anything,'' he said. ``For a family man, that's
tough. These guys don't see their kids much, and their family
really suffers during the season. One of the only chances to do
something quality with your family would be the night before a game
(at home).''
</P>
<P>
   Having a few hours of free time on road trips is a great thing
for players. For example, when the team made two trips to New York
in October, some players went into the city for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Not that they need it, but the NFL's Collective Bargaining
Agreement calls for each player to get a $37 dinner allowance on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives guys a chance to get in town, get a good meal, and
not rush around,'' said Bennett, who had 7:30 p.m. meetings the
night before games when he played with Buffalo. ``It's very
professional. (Reeves) treats us as men, and it's up to us to
behave that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of cities, the team is using different hotels this
year than in the past. In St. Louis, for example, the Falcons
stayed at a Marriott near the TWA Dome. But this year, they spent
Saturday night at Adam's Mark because it has enough space on one
floor to accommodate the team's pregame meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a conscious effort to stay in nice, newer properties
with good meeting space,'' Knox said.
</P>
<P>
   Although players have most of their time to themselves the night
before road games, there is an 11 p.m. hotel curfew and bed check.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's nice for them on the road to be able to go out
and get themselves a nice meal,'' Reeves said. ``As long as they're
paying attention during the week, I don't think it's a big deal.
I've never fined a person for being out the night before. If I had
a problem with it, then we've got the wrong kind of guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel operator is instructed not to let calls through to
players' rooms after curfew, and a security guard is posted on the
same floor as the players. It's his job to make sure that only
players are on the floor and to report player movement to team
security chief Doug Worthan, who usually stays in the room closest
to Reeves' suite.
</P>
<P>
   Players sleep two to a room, although they can have a single as
long as they pay for the difference in cost.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast is the same on every road trip, and it's always served
four hours before game time at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The drink offerings are orange juice, apple juice, grapefruit
juice, grape juice, cola and diet cola, low-fat milk, two flavors
of sports drink and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   To eat, players choose from scrambled eggs, pancakes and French
toast with hot syrup, grits, sausage links, baked potatoes (with
sour cream, butter, grated cheese and bacon bits), spaghetti, hot
blueberry muffins, croissants, and cornbread, four kinds of cereal,
sliced apples, bananas, peaches, and strawberries, grilled boneless
chicken breasts and a build-your-own sandwich bar.
</P>
<P>
   And that's nothing compared to what players eat and drink _ no
alcohol allowed _ on the flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more food than you've ever seen consumed in two hours,''
Knox said. ``All kinds of meats, pastas, vegetables, salads. You
name it.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, tonight's trip home from St. Louis will be a bad
example of the Falcons' new ways. They're flying one of the smaller
727s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delta has been very good about (changing the team charters),
but because it's Thanksgiving weekend, and busiest travel day of
the year, they couldn't change it this late,'' Knox said. ``But
otherwise it's worked out great.''
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Terance Mathis said, ``Sometimes we get rewarded
with the bigger planes, and that's great, but it really doesn't
make a difference to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, though, is 5-foot-10 and 185 pounds. Defensive end
Lester Archambeau is 6-5, 275. He'll take the bigger planes, thank
you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan always talks about how little things matter,'' he said.
``If you can stretch out on the plane, you won't be as stiff when
you arrive. Maybe that helps you play better.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT REEVES HAS BROUGHT TO THE FALCONS
</P>
<P>
   _ BIGGER PLANES: By upgrading to larger 757s from 727s, players
feel less cramped.
</P>
<P>
   _ FAMILY TIME: Reeves is one of the few NFL coaches who does not
require players to check into a hotel before home games.
</P>
<P>
   _ EARLY MEETING: Reeves will not hold a team meeting on the
night before a game, allowing players a few hours of free time to
hit the town when on the road.
</P>
<P>
   _ HOTEL UPGRADES: The team looks for ``nice, newer properties''
with ample space for team meetings.

DEALING WITH UNDERGROUND FUEL TANKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, Randi Hutton spent nearly $3,000 replacing something
at her Redding, Conn., home that wasn't broken.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hutton, a real estate sales agent in Redding, was keenly
aware of the risks associated with the underground oil storage tank
buried under her property. So following the advice she typically
gives to clients, Ms. Hutton purchased tank insurance to protect
her in the event the tank leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The liability for a leak can be tremendous,'' Ms. Hutton said,
explaining that it can cost thousands of dollars to eliminate the
contamination caused by a leaking fuel tank. ``That's why we've
always had tank insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, however, Ms. Hutton was advised that before her
insurance could be renewed, a test of the soil around the tank
would have to be conducted to determine whether the tank was
leaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that if we had to have the test done anyway, we
might as well spend the extra money and get the tank out of the
ground,'' she said, adding that while the tank was found to be in
good condition, she does not regret the decision to remove it.
``It's one less thing to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Hutton's decision to remove the tank _ and replace
it with an above-ground one _ was made easier because by acting
quickly, while her existing coverage was in effect, she would have
been covered if the tank was found to be leaking.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners who do not have insurance on their underground tanks,
however, face a far more uncertain future. ``Sooner or later, that
tank is going to fail,'' said William Selsberg, a Stamford. Conn.,
real estate lawyer. ``And if you don't think that's going to be a
problem while you own your home, you can be sure it's going to be a
problem when you sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Selsberg explained that homeowners with underground tanks that
are not insured and have not yet been tested have some difficult
decisions to make. If they attempt to obtain insurance _ which can
cost from $40 to $125 a year, depending on the age of the tank, for
$100,000 in coverage, with a $500 deductible _ and the insurance
carrier requires a test, as many now do, and the test discloses
leakage, the homeowner ends up with two pieces of very bad news.
</P>
<P>
   First, Selsberg said, the insurance company will decline
coverage. And second, he said, the testing company should report
the leak to state environmental officials as required by law. And
when that happens, he said, the homeowner has no alternative but to
remove the tank and eliminate any contamination _ without help from
the insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   ``That can be a scary proposition,'' he said. ``If the leak has
gotten into the ground water or a neighbor's well, you could be
talking about tens of thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Selsberg said, it is always possible to avoid
discovering a leaking tank by simply not testing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my clients take the position that if it ain't broke,
don't fix it,'' he said. ``But I find that unacceptable because
they don't know it ain't broke unless they test it first.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, there is no longer any question but that when
the time comes to sell the house, the buyer will almost certainly
insist on a test, and may even demand that the tank be removed even
if it isn't leaking.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Selsberg said, is that no test can guarantee that a
tank that is not leaking today won't start leaking tomorrow. In
addition, he said, there are increasing uncertainties about the
future availability of tank insurance. ``My feeling is that if you
have an underground fuel storage tank on your property you
basically have one good option,'' Selsberg said. ``Get it out as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   While removing an underground tank is clearly the best way to
avoid future problems, it is also possible in many places for an
underground tank that is no longer being used to be abandoned in
place, provided that proper precautions are taken during the
abandonment process.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut, New York and New Jersey, for example, all allow for
abandonment in place, provided that the abandonment is permitted by
local authorities and is conducted according to the procedures for
abandonment set by the municipality.
</P>
<P>
   Bob VanFossen, assistant director of site remediation for the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, said that in New
Jersey, municipalities that permit abandonment generally have
fairly standard procedures that must be followed if a tank is to be
abandoned properly. For example, he said, many towns require the
soil around the tank to be tested for contamination before the
abandonment process can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is mandatory to report to our department any discharge of a
contaminate,'' VanFossen said, adding that if contamination is
found, the tank cannot be abandoned in place but must be removed.
In such a case, he said, all contaminated soil must be removed and
replaced with clean fill.
</P>
<P>
   If the test does not reveal any evidence of contamination,
however, VanFossen said, the abandonment can proceed. Generally, he
said, the first step is to pump any remaining liquid out of the
tank. Then, he said, most laws require that the top of the tank be
cut off so that a worker can get inside to clean any residue and
make a visual inspection for leaks.
</P>
<P>
   If leaks are found, VanFossen said, the entire tank must be
removed, the surrounding soil must be tested for contamination, and
all contaminated soil must be removed and replaced. If no leaks are
discovered, he said, the tank can usually be filled with sand and
then covered over with soil. Finally, he said, all vents and supply
lines must be securely capped.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, tank removal experts say, it can actually be less
expensive to remove an underground tank than to abandon one in
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way _ whether it's a removal or abandonment _ it's
going to cost you about $1,300,'' said Skip Kost, president of
Enviroshield, a tank testing and removal company in Stratford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Kost said, homeowners who are hesitant to have their
tanks tested _ and even more hesitant to have them removed or
abandoned _ might be basing their fears on contamination cleanup
stories that represent the exception rather than the rule.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You always hear the worst-case scenario,'' Kost said.
``Everybody has heard about the jobs that cost $10,000 or $50,000
or $100,000, but the truth is, most tanks aren't leaking and most
clean-up jobs end up costing a couple to a few thousand dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In cases where no contamination is present, Kost said, an
existing steel tank can be removed and replaced with a new
500-gallon fiberglass or corrosion-resistant steel tank that
carries a 30-year warranty for about $2,500 to $3,000, including
the cost of removing the old tank.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Annis, president of ANCO Environmental Services, a Berkeley
Heights, N.J., tank-testing company, said that his company sells a
275-gallon, double-walled above-ground tank that can be installed
in a basement for about $1,200, not including the cost of removal
or abandonment.
</P>
<P>
   Annis added that while many homeowners may be hesitant to test
their tanks out of fear of learning something they would rather not
know, the one thing that will almost certainly increase the cost of
an oil-leak contamination clean-up is the passage of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of sight is out of mind,'' Annis said. ``But when you wait
until the 11th hour to deal with something like this, you could be
turning a minor problem into a major one.''

<P>
   William Keating, a London-based art dealer who was born in the
United States and who helped the Australian financier Alan Bond put
together a collection of Australian artworks, died on Nov. 4 at his
home in London. He was 55.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, said his wife, Angela
Nevill-Keating.
</P>
<P>
   It was Keating who placed Bond's successful $53.9 million
telephone bid for van Gogh's ``Irises'' at Sotheby's in 1987.
Keating was also known for rediscovering the work of Paul Helleu,
the Belle Epoque artist.
</P>
<P>
   Keating was born in Savannah, Ga., and attended Benedictine
College in Savannah and the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   After college he moved to London. In the late 1960s, he met
Angela Nevill while he was in Amsterdam one weekend attending a
Rembrandt exhibition. The couple eventually went into partnership,
forming Nevill Keating, private art dealers. They were married in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife.

ALLAN JOHNSON, 82, FORMER SAKS CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Minn., Calif., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Allan Raymond Johnson, a former chairman of Saks
Fifth Avenue who helped shepherd the elegant department store
through an era of rapid expansion, died on Thanksgiving Day at the
Mary Manning Walsh nursing home in Manhattan. He was 82 and had
lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   During his years at Saks, Johnson was involved in the renovation
or addition of nearly two dozen stores, said his daughter Susan
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the son of a Saks executive, joined the store as
personnel director in 1945 and held a variety of senior executive
posts until he was named executive vice president in 1961. In 1969,
when his mentor, Adam Gimbel, retired, Johnson became the store's
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, he was given the added title of chief executive;
he held that job until 1978, when he was named a senior vice
president of Brown &AMP; Williamson Industries, then the store's parent
company.
</P>
<P>
   He continued to serve as chairman of Saks until 1979, when he
was appointed chairman of the Batus Retail Division, then the
corporate owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and Gimbel Brothers. Saks
Fifth Avenue was run for four decades by the Gimbel family, until
1969.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was a popular executive who maintained a warm, familial
atmosphere at the store, said Helen O'Hagan, a former vice
president of public relations. He organized a glee club for
employees and held dinners to honor longtime employees, she said.
``It was really like a very big family,'' Ms. O'Hagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's personal touch _ what might be considered paternalism
today _ was credited with helping prevent his employees from
unionizing despite several organizing drives.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement in 1981, Johnson served on corporate
boards, including those of Viacom International Inc. and Shearson
Lehman Investments (now Salomon Smith Barney). He also served as
chairman of the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau, the
National Retail Merchants Association and the Fifth Avenue
Association. But his family said the organization he was most
devoted to was the Boy Scouts of America.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was divorced three times and is survived by his fourth
wife, Maria Toia Johnson, whom he married in 1980. In addition to
Ms. Johnson, who lives in Riverdale, the Bronx, he is survived by
three other daughters, Jane Fell of Rochester Hills, Minn., Kathy
Jones of Los Angeles and Barbara Hobin of Worcester, Mass.; a
brother, Patrick Raymond Johnson of Boston; seven grandchildren,
and four great-grandchildren.

 STEPHEN TIM, 61, PLANT EXPERT AT BROOKLYN BOTANIC GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stephen K-M Tim, a botanist and illustrator who was a
guiding force for many of the exhibits and publications of the
Brooklyn Botanic Garden, died on Nov. 21 at New York University
Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 61 and lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Tim, who was the garden's vice president for science, library
and publications, died of cardiac arrest, garden officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in South Africa, Tim got his start at the garden
in part through a fortunate coincidence. Elizabeth Scholtz, who as
director hired him 27 years ago, said that at the time, garden
officials were looking for an assistant horticultural taxonomist,
someone who was supposed to know everything about everything.
</P>
<P>
   Tim was a mycologist, a specialist in mushrooms, and did not
seem to fit the bill. But Ms. Scholtz was a fellow South African,
and looked more closely at his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed that he came from Rhodes University, which had a
fine reputation for general botany,'' said Ms. Scholtz, now the
garden's director emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   South African botanists, she added, ``learned our taxonomy
before we learned anything else.'' Tim got the job.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Ghillean Prance, director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at
Kew in England, said that a taxonomist's role at a botanical garden
is seemingly simple, yet crucial. ``You need someone who can
reliably identify the plants you are growing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But because a taxonomist has a science background, he can help
with interpretation, Prance said.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what Tim did. After two years he was named
curator of the herbarium, and a year later created the first of
many exhibits, on insect-eating plants.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he was involved in creating a garden for the disabled,
and in renovating the Shakespeare garden. His most significant
achievement was the conception of exhibits at the Steinhardt
Conservatory in the mid-1980s, including a ``Trail of Evolution''
that traces plants through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Tim was also a skilled illustrator whose work appeared in The
New York Times and in many of the garden's books and newsletters,
which are among the most popular botanical publications in the
world. His drawing skills were self-taught (he made his first study
at age 4 while sick with the measles), and were no doubt aided by
his skills as a taxonomist, said Judith Zuk, president of the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Observation is so critical in taxonomy,'' Ms. Zuk said. ``From
a botanical illustration standpoint, this made him particularly
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim was an expert on poisonous plants, and served as an
emergency contact for poison control centers and hospitals around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tim is survived by his wife, Nancy Shopis Tim; a sister, Phonyim
Tim, of Victoria, British Columbia; a brother, Peter, of
Johannesburg, and three nephews.

COMMENTARY: CITY CALLS ITS OWN BACK FROM SUBURBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREEPORT, N.Y. _ Several years ago, John Acierno woke up in his
four-bedroom Colonial in the prosperous Long Island village of
Manhasset with the kind of primal scream heard in a growing number
of suburban homes these days: ``What am I doing out here?''
</P>
<P>
   His children had moved out, leaving him and his wife, Roberta,
with three bedrooms where no one was sleeping. Everything about the
suburbs that made sense when the children were around _ the
worry-free schools, the back yard for touch football with the
cousins, the easy hop to Dunkin' Donuts _ no longer made sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't for me,'' was his verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Like other suburban misfits, he pined for New York, where he had
his business, a car-dispatching service, his museums _ oil painting
is his hobby _ and, well, the big city itself. ``You get up at 2 in
the morning and there's life,'' he said. ``In the suburbs, at 9
o'clock they roll the streets up.''
</P>
<P>
   So with the city cooperating by reinventing itself in a safer,
tidier form, the Aciernos sold their house and are counting the
days until they pass muster at a Fifth Avenue co-op.
</P>
<P>
   For halfhearted suburbanites like Acierno, 62, the suburbs have
always been a time as well as a place _ a defined period of life
that, like a hard winter, comes to an end. That's why it was not
surprising to read recently that, with the city rejuvenated,
real-estate brokers were reporting a doubling in the number of
returnees, mostly empty-nesters coming back while still young
enough to savor the electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, including brokers, thought of New York as a place to
relax and enjoy life,'' says Barbara Corcoran, chairwoman of the
Corcoran Group. ``They thought of it as a place to work and
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what is happening is not really new. New York's
suburbs have always been inhabited by two discrete species. There
are those who grew up there, took an urban detour to land a spouse
or a career, but had their sights set on settling in suburbia. Then
there are those who moved to the suburbs with reluctant hearts,
more for the children than for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The two groups overlap in feeling the suburbs are unmatched for
providing an untroubled world of decorous houses and pleasant
neighbors who may have problems but, unlike the homeless,
fortunately keep them invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Many initially grudging suburbanites never leave, because they
grow accustomed to unruffled days, the vivid parade of the seasons,
the civility. Others leap back, finding themselves starving for
hurly-burly street theater and the cosmopolitan flavors of
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The hungry group includes Jaki and Richard Soreff, who in the
late 1960s ambivalently arrived in Freeport on Long Island's south
shore to raise Jeffrey and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soreff, 60, a Hadassah member, is an endearing eccentric, a
graduate of the High School of Music and Art, who when she's in the
city ambles down to Battery Park to chat about snakes with the
python man or takes her Middle Eastern drum to a spot near Central
Park's band shell to jam with the resident young drummers.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can I do this in the suburbs?'' she said. ``You don't find
these people here. They just don't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Although somewhat more partial to the suburbs, Richard Soreff,
an accountant, has deep city roots stretching back to Public School
99 in Midwood, Brooklyn, where Woody Allen was a classmate. (The
comedian showed his promise when he wrote in Soreff's eighth-grade
autograph book: ``Roses are red/ Violets are blue/ Alan Ladd is
handsome/ So what!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in almost every way the suburbs are an also-ran,''
Mrs. Soreff said. ``It's almost the country, but not quite. It's
almost the city, but not quite. It has a little bit of what both
areas have to offer, but not either.''
</P>
<P>
   The Soreffs moved to New York City once before, staying for 12
years until a lucrative offer enticed them to sell their East 68th
Street apartment. When they returned to Freeport in March, Mrs.
Soreff hated it all over again. She is searching for another
Manhattan apartment and insists she will not even miss her suburban
greenery.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have Central Park,'' she said, as if she were already back.
``And I don't have to do the weeding.''

STUART SUTHERLAND DIES AT 71; PSYCHOLOGIST TOLD OF HIS ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: England)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stuart Sutherland, a British psychologist who analyzed his own
brush with mental illness in the most remarkable of his insightful
books, died on Nov. 8 in his home in Brighton, England. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said the University of Sussex,
where he was professor emeritus of experimental psychology.
</P>
<P>
   A severe case of manic depression struck Sutherland at the
height of his career. His candid account of this experience,
``Breakdown: A Personal Crisis and a Medical Dilemma,'' became a
best seller.
</P>
<P>
   It was first published in Britain in 1976, and it was revised
and reissued this year by Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   The new version added chapters on the latest therapies,
including drugs that are now used to treat the disorder.
</P>
<P>
   His other books that are in print in this country are,
``Irrationality: Why We Can't Think Straight!'' (Rutgers, 1994) and
``The International Dictionary of Psychology'' (Crossroad, 1995).
</P>
<P>
   Norman Stuart Sutherland was born in Birmingham and educated at
Magdalen College, Oxford, where he began his academic career after
receiving a doctorate in 1953 with a joint degree in psychology,
philosophy and physiology.
</P>
<P>
   A major focus of his research was how animals, including humans,
recognize shapes.
</P>
<P>
   To pursue the subject, he made annual pilgrimages to Naples in
the 1950s and 1960s to work at the Zoological Station there.
</P>
<P>
   He and several fellow experimenters investigated such things as
the physical basis of memory, experimenting with the common octopus
because it is one of the animal kingdom's fast learners.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland lectured on experimental psychology at Oxford in the
early 1960s and in 1965 joined the faculty of the newly established
University of Sussex in Brighton. He made his mark when he set up
and directed its experimental psychology laboratory and made it a
magnet for aspiring specialists in that field.
</P>
<P>
   His mental breakdown in the early 1970s cut short his research,
but he never stopped writing on his specialty as well as the wide
range of subjects that piqued his interest.
</P>
<P>
   His ``Breakdown'' inspired the play ``Melon,'' by Simon Gray,
which had a successful run in London's West End, starring Alan
Bates.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland is survived by his wife of 32 years, Jose Louis
Fogden; two daughters, Gay and Julia Sutherland, and one
granddaughter.

<P>
   Erik Nitsche, an art director, graphic designer, photographer,
illustrator and book packager known for his posters,
advertisements, logos and book designs, died on Nov. 10 in Danbury,
Conn. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Nitsche was born in Lausanne, Switzerland, in 1908 and worked in
Switzerland, Germany and the United States. He was among a handful
of progressive designers and artists who imbued American graphic
design with a Modern European sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most important contributions was the development of
information design systems in books and corporate annual reports
produced for General Dynamics Co. from 1955 to 1960.
</P>
<P>
   At General Dynamics, which produced the first nuclear-powered
submarine, the Nautilus, Nitsche was hired to develop a visual
image that would introduce this submarine to the world and at the
same time emphasize the company's peaceful concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The design for the submarine was top secret, so Nitsche devised
a symbolic solution based on the message ``Atoms for Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He created a series of posters in English, Russian, German,
French, Hindi and Japanese featuring abstract and symbolic images.
</P>
<P>
   Today these are among the classic modern posters.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, Nitsche made illustrations for the German
weeklies Querschnitt and Simplicissimus, designed alphabets for the
French type foundry Deberny &AMP; Peignot, and illustrated covers for
Harper's Bazaar, Fortune, Town and Country, Vanity Fair, House and
Garden, and Look.
</P>
<P>
   He produced several hundred record-album covers for Decca in the
United States and was vice president of Dorland International, an
advertising agency in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and '60s he was consultant to the Museum of Modern
Art's department of design and to Standard Oil of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He also designed advertising campaigns for Saks Fifth Avenue and
Ohrbach's department stores and posters for Universal Pictures and
20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Nitsche was an innovative book designer and packager. He was
visual editor of the General Dynamics company history, a huge book
titled ``Dynamic America.'' Other major projects were a 12-volume
history of science and technology that sold more than 2 million
copies in many languages, and a five-volume history of the 20th
century, produced by his company, Erik Nitsche International.
</P>
<P>
   His book design had a simple beauty and didactic economy, with
dynamic silhouettes and vignettes. His typography was clean and
crisp, a marriage of classical and modern approaches.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Nitsche temporarily turned to painting, but a year later
he moved to Munich and returned to the field, designing exhibition
catalogs, posters and stamps.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Renate; two sons, John, of
Philadelphia and Marc, of Geneva, and five grandchildren.

TAKOVER IS ORDERED AT TROUBLED UNION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The parent union of District Council 37, New York
City's largest municipal union, said Saturday that it was placing
the council in trusteeship, effective Monday, to put an end to a
spiraling scandal that has involved vote fraud and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald McEntee, president of the parent union, the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, named a
trustee to run the council and said that Stanley Hill, the
council's executive director, was taking a voluntary unpaid leave.
</P>
<P>
   McEntee's announcement was a deeply embarrassing blow to Hill,
who worked hard in recent weeks to fend off trusteeship and to
demonstrate that he was in charge and was setting matters straight.
</P>
<P>
   The parent union moved after weeks of embarrassing revelations
about the district council, which represents 120,000 city
employees, including social workers, engineers, sewage treatment
workers, janitors and crossing guards.
</P>
<P>
   One district council leader has pleaded guilty to embezzlement,
and another has been expelled after being found to have stolen more
than $1.7 million. At least 6 of the 23 members on the council's
executive board are under investigation on allegations of receiving
kickbacks, while the Manhattan district attorney has subpoenaed
records from the district council and all 56 of its constituent
locals.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, two of Hill's closest aides resigned after
admitting that they knew about fraud in the 1996 ratification vote
on the union's five-year contract, which included a deeply
unpopular two-year wage freeze.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, McEntee said: ``My first concern is for the
hard-working members of this union. They deserve an honest,
credible union. I pledge to the 120,000 members of D.C. 37 that the
reputation of this union will be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   McEntee named Lee Saunders, one of his top assistants, to serve
as trustee of the council, which includes 56 union locals. In
recent days, Hill has praised Saunders for his work as trustee of a
local representing nearly 25,000 school cafeteria aides and
crossing guards. Saunders has balanced that local's budget after it
fell deeply in debt under its president, Charles Hughes, who was
expelled last June when a union judicial panel found that he had
embezzled more than $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the trusteeship, the parent union will run the district
council's day-to-day business, including grievance hearings,
negotiations and staffing.
</P>
<P>
   According to McEntee's news release, Hill will take his unpaid
leave, pending the outcome of the parent union's investigations.
The parent union has hired KPMG Peat Marwick to audit the district
council's books, and the investigative firm Kroll Associates to
look into the fraud in the 1996 ratification vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As the waves of scandal lapped ever higher in recent weeks, Hill
tried to restore some semblance of order. He pushed through
constitutional amendments to tighten the district council's
financial controls. He boasted that the district council continued
to deliver as many services as ever, including grievance
procedures, training sessions for shop stewards and night college
classes for hundreds of members.
</P>
<P>
   And he met with editorial boards to argue that he should not be
blamed for all the wrongdoing in the council's 56 largely
autonomous locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this is my toughest crisis,'' he said in an interview
last week. ``Yes, there are some bad eggs. But again, this council
is going to survive. We are making corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   But his predecessor, Victor Gotbaum, widely considered the
city's pre-eminent labor leader in his nearly 25 years at the
district council's helm, acknowledged being upset by the spiraling
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Are you affected by this?''' he said. ``I was the
head of this council for almost a quarter-century, and all this
really ticks me off.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Hill was elected president of a social workers' local,
but when he lost his race for re-election, he was appointed to the
district council's staff. Gotbaum adopted him as a protege and
groomed him as a successor, but now Gotbaum talks as if his
Pygmalion has fallen far short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders and labor experts point to two major reasons
behind the district council's crisis. First, the council has an
awkward governing structure in which many executive board members
rely on Hill for their perks, so they are loath to ask him tough
questions. At the same time, Hill relies on a handful of presidents
of powerful locals for his re-election, so he is reluctant to come
down hard on them.
</P>
<P>
   Second, many officials say Hill is too nice, someone who has a
conciliatory management style and has taken a hear-no-evil,
see-no-evil approach to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the pathway to hell is good intentions,'' Gotbaum
said. ``The pathway to bad leadership is being a nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill has also been criticized for not taking a tough stand on
the council's finances _ despite the Wall Street boom, its net
assets have dropped to $3.5 million from $22 million in 1994.
Council officials say about half the decline was caused by new
accounting rules.
</P>
<P>
   But some union leaders point to a general laxness about
spending. For instance, the district council and its 56 locals sent
more than 700 people, at an estimated cost of more than $2 million,
to the parent union's convention in Hawaii this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, Gotbaum and Charles Ensley, president of a
local representing 14,000 social workers, have insisted that Hill
must have either known about or approved the fraud in the 1996
ratification vote. Both said it was hard to believe that the aides
who resigned last week _ Hill's associate director and another
senior official _ would have engaged in vote fraud without Hill's
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parallels to Watergate are very real,'' Ensley said. ``We
continue to stonewall here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hill insisted that he knew nothing about the fraud until The
New York Times reported last week that the Manhattan district
attorney was investigating allegations made by a union leader that
the ratification vote had been rigged.

MEDICAL AIDE FATALLY STRUCK BY UNMARKED POLICE CAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An off-duty emergency medical technician was struck
and killed by an unmarked police car after he stepped off a bus in
Brooklyn early Saturday, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The police car, containing three officers, was chasing two other
cars that had been speeding and swerving along Broadway near Hooper
Street in the Williamsburg section, police said.
</P>
<P>
   They said the victim, Arnold John, 47, of 1074 Eastern Parkway
in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, was struck just after he left a city
bus on Broadway near Woodhull Hospital at 2:55 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The three officers in the unmarked car were not injured. The
car, driven by Officer James Bodnar, had been chasing a BMW and a
Honda Accord east on Broadway after the officers observed the two
cars playing ``road games,'' police said. The two other officers
were not identified.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW turned off Broadway, and the police car turned on its
dashboard light and siren and continued to follow the Honda, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   John stepped off the rear of a westbound bus traveling in the
center lane of Broadway, moments after the Honda passed, police
said. John walked into the street to get to the curb and was hit by
the police car, they said.
</P>
<P>
   After the collision, an officer leapt from the car and ran into
the hospital to get assistance.
</P>
<P>
   John was taken to the hospital emergency room, where he was
pronounced dead at 3:50 a.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said officers did not get the license number of the Honda
but were looking for the BMW.
</P>
<P>
   The death is being investigated by the Accident Investigation
Team, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are also investigating the accident, said Patrick
Clark, a spokesman for District Attorney Charles Hynes of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said two nonpolice witnesses, including the bus driver,
confirmed the officer's account of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in a legitimate response; they saw the speeder and
were required to respond,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The police car was traveling faster than 30 mph, but less than
50 mph, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and co-workers of John said they wanted more details
about the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Richard McAllan, a member of the executive board of Emergency
Medical Service Union, said that even if the officer was traveling
to an emergency, police _ like ambulance drivers _ have a
responsibility to drive at a speed that would allow the driver to
stop or swerve to avoid pedestrians or other cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't change the tragedy,'' McAllan said. ``But if these
guys were in an emergency situation it would be different than if
these guys were just hot-rodding around.''
</P>
<P>
   John, who had been an emergency medical technician for a little
more than three years, worked in the back of ambulances and
administered aid to victims, said Ronald Mainor, John's partner.
Mainor said that his friend was a calming influence, both on
colleagues and on the injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't make light, but he helped ease the anxiety,'' Mainor
said. ``That's a gift he had.''
</P>
<P>
   John was married, with a son and daughter. His friends and
relatives said they were devastated by the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very hard-working person,'' said Wilfred Lewis,
John's brother-in-law, ``dedicated to his job and a dedicated
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Mourners visited John's apartment Saturday afternoon to see his
wife, Veronica John. ``The Lord give me strength,'' Mrs. John
repeated over and over again, as she clutched her husband's
emergency medical technician uniform. ``I'm empty, right now _ just
empty. I can't function.''

ROLANDO LA SERIE, 75, LATIN SINGING GREAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (js) 
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rolando La Serie, one of the great Cuban singers of his time,
died last Sunday at Healthsouth Doctors' Hospital in Coral Gables,
Fla. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac complications, The Associated Press
reported.
</P>
<P>
   La Serie had a big, open voice, slightly hoarse and aggressive.
Although some of his biggest hits were ballads, his up-tempo
singing was a marvel of improvisation and sound. His attack and his
enthusiasm earned him the nickname ``El Guapo de la Cancion,''
which in Cuban slang translates as valiant or bold singer.
</P>
<P>
   La Serie, from Santa Clara in Cuba, started out as a
percussionist _ he was one of the original members of Beny More's
group _ whose singing was seen as a bit of an embarrassment. But in
1956 he had the opportunity to record a ballad by Mario Fernandez
Porta called ``Mentiras Tuyas,'' which he transformed with his
distinctively hard sound. The composer of the song objected to La
Serie's interpretation, but the record sold 30,000 copies in the
first few days after its release.
</P>
<P>
   La Serie left Cuba soon after, traveling the world and living in
Argentina and Mexico, which cost him his fame in his native
country. But he maintained a busy schedule, recording with the
music's biggest stars, even in exile from Cuba. He recorded in New
York with Tito Puente and his band in the 1960's for an album
called ``Pachanga in New York'' and with the great Puerto Rican
band Cortijo y Su Combo, singing with Ismael Rivera. Along the way
he continued to have hits, including ``Amalia Batista,'' now a
Latin standard. He added tangos to his repertory, and his frequent
interjection ``De pelicula!'' (``From a movie!'') became his
trademark.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s he moved to Florida, and in the '80s he recorded
with Johnny Pacheco on Fania Records. He also began recording with
Caiman Records, which produced the fine album ``Ay, Se Paso La
Serie,'' recorded in 1985 in a modern Cuban style.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gisela.

 THEODORE NEWHOUSE, 95; HELPED BUILD A COMMUNICATIONS EMPIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Theodore Newhouse, who began a lifelong career in
publishing as a manager of a family-owned newspaper, The Long
Island Press, and helped his brothers assemble one of the nation's
biggest communications conglomerates, died Saturday at the Hebrew
Home for the Aged in the Riverdale section of the Bronx after a
long illness. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse was the last of the founding brothers who turned from
hawking newspapers on the street to buying newspaper companies. The
Newhouse holdings now include 26 newspapers; Conde Nast
Publications, which publishes The New Yorker, Vogue and Vanity
Fair; the Sunday newspaper supplement Parade, and interests in
cable television programming and cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   As the associate publisher of Newhouse newspapers, Newhouse had
kept up an active involvement in the family business until his
health began to fail about 12 years ago, said David Starr, the
senior editor of Newhouse newspapers. Newhouse moved into the
nursing home in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a hands-on, shirtsleeves manager and he knew more about
newspaper production than anybody,'' Starr said. ``He was the elder
person in the family and in the business. He was the consultant on
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhouse was raised in Bayonne, N.J., one of eight children of
impoverished immigrants. His father came from Russia; his mother
was from Austria. As a child, Newhouse helped the family by selling
newspapers on the street.
</P>
<P>
   His eldest brother, Samuel I. Newhouse, who died in 1979, got
the family into the publishing business when he bought The Staten
Island Advance, a financially troubled paper, in 1922. Newhouse,
then 19, was recruited to help out and get what he would later call
``on the job training,'' as was another brother, Norman, who died
in 1988. That fraternal management style came to characterize the
Newhouse family business.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his life, Newhouse maintained a strong interest in
the arts. Even as he was working at the family's first newspapers,
he took night courses at several New York City universities in
opera, music and art, and studied dance in the summers.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Caroline H. Newhouse, whom he married in 1956
after the death of his first wife, Beatrice, Newhouse was a patron
of several arts organizations, including the New York City Opera
and Career Transition for Dancers, a nonprofit organization that
helps professional dancers after they retire.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Newhouse is survived by two
granddaughters, Julie Lobel and Amy Bermant Adler, both of New York
City, who are the children of his daughter, Jane Berman, and six
great-grandchildren.

 REAL ESTATE: PFIZER TO BUILD TRAINING CENTER ON HOTEL GROUNDS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MARY McALEER VIZARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RYE BROOK, N.Y. _ In an unusual linkup of a company management
training facility with an existing complex that serves a variety of
companies, the Pfizer Corp. has broken ground on a
110,000-square-foot education center on the grounds of the Doral
Arrowwood hotel and conference center.
</P>
<P>
   At the groundbreaking, B.J. Robison, Pfizer's senior vice
president for corporate employee resources, said that the training
center, to be used by the company's sales managers, would be vital
to the company's plan to move up from its present position as the
fourth-largest pharmaceutical company to become the largest in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help us attract, train and retain the best people,''
Robison said. ``Our management-training programs will be conducted
here as of January 2000, when the center opens, which is
significant since Pfizer will become the world's No. 1
pharmaceutical company by the year 2001.'' He added that the center
itself would create 120 new full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing such a corporate presence at an existing conference
center ``is a unique arrangement,'' said Steven Smith, spokesman
for the International Association of Conference Centers, based in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most companies build their own discrete centers in isolated
locations,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``But that can
backfire because when they're not using it they can have a tough
time attracting other users. Also corporations aren't in the
hospitality business and usually aren't very good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer already had a long-term relationship with Arrowwood,
according to Art Silverman, Pfizer's director of corporate
services. He said it had conducted many of its training programs at
the 318,000-square-foot center on Anderson Hill Road, where it
maintains 25 to 30 full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we needed to build our own center because we're
expanding our sales force,'' Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   This is due in part to Pfizer's introduction of several new
drugs in recent years, including the much-discussed Viagra
male-potency enhancer. ``There are several more in the pipeline,''
Silverman said, adding that the company believed that the new drugs
would significantly increase business.

<P>
   Before deciding to build at Arrowwood, Pfizer had considered the
feasibility of establishing its own separate center, according to
Josh Kuriloff, a senior director at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, which was
enlisted by Pfizer to find an appropriate site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked for about a year, mostly in New York and New
Jersey,'' Kuriloff said. Arrowwood was ultimately chosen because it
was ``known territory, close to Pfizer's headquarters in
Manhattan,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``In addition,'' he noted, ``it had an existing infrastructure
the company could utilize, such as hotel rooms, recreational and
dining facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuriloff said Pfizer would have an exclusive 15-year lease
valued at around $170 million. ``That includes everything,'' he
said, ``use of the center, hotel, all the facilities.'' Among other
things it calls for Pfizer's committing to 33,000 room nights a
year. ``Working out the details was overwhelmingly complex,''
Kuriloff said.
</P>
<P>
   To persuade Pfizer to build its center at Arrowwood, state and
county officials, working with the Village of Rye Brook, eventually
came up with an incentive package worth around $27 million in
grants, tax abatements and energy rebates, according to Charles
Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were being offered even better deals to move to New
Jersey,'' Gargano said. ``But their good working relationship with
Arrowwood proved a major selling point.''
</P>
<P>
   The $40-million construction project, which received its final
approvals on Nov. 17, is a boon for Rye Brook and one of the most
complex economic deals in the village's history, said Village
Manager Christopher Russo.,
</P>
<P>
   During negotiations, he said, Arrowwood agreed to drop a $2.5
million judgment that it had won for overpayment of village taxes
in exchange for economic incentives for the project. ``We dodged a
bullet,'' Russo said. ``I don't know where we would have gotten the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The center will occupy a sloping piece of property adjacent to
the existing conference center and abutting Arrowwood's nine-hole
golf course. To accommodate the increased business generated by the
center, 100 new hotel rooms will be added to Arrowwood's current
total of 274.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, the center will connect to Arrowwood as if
it were one building,'' said Ron Rheaume, project manager for the
Hillier Group of Princeton, N.J., which designed Arrowwood in 1983.
But inside, the Pfizer Learning Center ``will have its own separate
entrance and identity,'' Rheaume said.
</P>
<P>
   Arrowwood is a low-slung, cedar-sided structure that sits on 146
heavily wooded acres. The design for the center will attempt to
take advantage of the surroundings, Rheaume said, and ``bring the
outdoors in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be tree-like lighting elements throughout and a
leaf pattern on the ceiling, as well as lots of glass looking out
on the golf course,'' Rheaume added. The center will have a
restaurant, meeting rooms and a studio for developing training
tapes and making live training broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   All the meeting rooms will have rear screen projectors and seats
equipped with computer ports. ``From their seats, employees can
connect to the network and, using key pads, vote on instant
corporate surveys,'' Rheaume explained.
</P>
<P>
   Arrowwood itself has recently completed an $8 million
refurbishment of its facilities, guest rooms and an expansion of
its sports center, according to Bruce Blum, president of Doral
Hotels and Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rooms have all been upgraded with new finishes, so they
will look like new and match the new rooms being built for
Pfizer.'' When the new rooms are not being used by Pfizer, they
will be open to other guests, as well, Blum added.
</P>
<P>
   While the timing coincided, the upgrading of hotel facilities
was not done exclusively for Pfizer, Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we're working with companies like Pfizer and others
during the week, we also have to be a resort for the people who
come here on the weekends and pay out of their own pockets,'' he
said. (The weekend rate for Friday and Saturday, $135 per night,
includes buffet breakfast.) ``To attract that business in our
competitive marketplace, it requires doing total upgrades of
facilities on a regular basis.''

MASS. DUO TAKE NOS. 1 AND 2 IN NORTHEAST CROSS COUNTRY CHAMPS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Andy Powell, who crawled across the finish line last
year after collapsing with exhaustion, raced to victory Saturday in
the Foot Locker Northeast Regional High School Cross Country
Championship at Van Cortland Park in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, an undefeated 18-year-old senior at Oliver Ames High
School in North Easton, Mass., ran the hilly, 5,000-meter course in
15 minutes 23.2 seconds to triumph by 125 yards over his
Massachusetts rival, Franklyn Sanchez of Lynn Tech. In 1997,
Powell, rated the top high school miler in the country, fell within
a few strides of the finish but hung on for the eighth and final
berth in the national meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have the scars on my leg,'' said the Stanford-bound
Powell, referring to his scrape last year. ``I dedicated this
season to coming back and doing better.''
</P>
<P>
   The top eight boys and top eight girls from the Northeast and
three other regional meets qualify for the 20th Foot Locker
Championships on Dec. 12 in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Amid spring-like 60-degree temperatures and a strong sun, senior
Erin Sullivan of Mount Mansfield, Vt., the defending girls
Northeast and national titlist, led the field through the first
mile. But Sullivan weakened as the runners came out of the woods
and onto the home straightaway, where Jillian Mastroianni surged
ahead and went on to win in 17:54.2.
</P>
<P>
   Mastroianni, the 1997 New York State champion from Sayville High
on Long Island, did not compete in last week's New York State meet,
at the same site, to focus solely on the regional. ``I didn't want
to taper off my training twice in two weeks,'' said Mastroianni, a
junior who placed 15th in last year's nationals.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey's Erin Donahue, a sophomore at Haddonfield High, and
Cate Guiney, a senior at Middletown South, finished second and
third, respectively. In all, New Jersey took five of the 16
qualifying berths, the most of any state. Cheryl Bauer of Morris
Hills High was the eighth and last girls qualifier. The two New
Jersey boys who earned nationals berth were state champion Nate
Miller of Highland High and Jon Fasulo of Hunterdon Central.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue ran her best race of the season despite a strenuous
schedule on Friday. A 5-foot-7-inch point guard on her high school
basketball team, she attended a three-hour basketball practice on
Friday morning, then, for fun, ran a 5-kilometer road race in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' she said, ``on Friday night, I rested.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Powell, careful to conserve energy and remain on his feet
for the entire race. He and Sanchez, competing shoulder to shoulder
all season in New England, have become good friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided beforehand to run with each other, not against each
other,'' Powell said. ``That way, we felt one of us would win.''

POLITICAL MEMO: WHIFF OF RED HERRING IN VACCO STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It looks as if Attorney General Dennis Vacco lost
his re-election bid by a margin narrower than the space between
riders on a rush-hour No. 6 train. Democratic challenger Eliot
Spitzer has declared victory, and a growing number of Republicans
are conceding the contest, albeit quietly.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly four weeks after the election, the state GOP Chairman
William Powers is still directing an aggressive effort in court to
overturn Spitzer's apparent victory, with charges of nefarious
doings by Democrats. Powers and Vacco, a fellow Republican, could
be forgiven for clinging to the hope that some stroke of lightning
would help them overtake Spitzer, but it seems that at this point,
the court fight is not primarily about changing the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer leads in the counting by 21,000 votes out of 4.2 million
cast. If that gap of one-half of 1 percent holds, the contest will
have been the closest statewide race in New York in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats contend that Powers, never one to take losing lightly,
wants to cast enough doubt on Spitzer's victory to sully his name,
a view that even some Republicans subscribe to. And officials and
strategists in both political camps say that Powers is really
trying to divert attention from his own mistakes, which they say
contributed to Vacco's apparent defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Powers declined to discuss the matter. The Republican Party and
the Vacco campaign referred calls to Thomas Spargo, the lawyer
handling the court case. Spargo did not return calls last week.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to Powers, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, insisted that the lawsuit on Vacco's behalf should be
taken at face value. ``It's about ensuring that this election was
legitimate, without fraud,'' he said. Asked what evidence of fraud
there was, he said, ``We're still looking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bill Powers wants to put up a giant smokescreen to
convince everybody upstate that New York City cheats,'' said state
Sen. Martin Connor of Brooklyn, Spitzer's lawyer and leader of the
Democratic minority in the Senate. ``He wants the upstate voter's
memory bank on Eliot Spitzer to say, `Oh yeah, that's the guy who
won that election that was kind of shady, the one that was stolen.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Tarring Spitzer's name, the theory goes, may weaken him in
future elections and reinforces the deep mistrust many upstaters,
who tend to be Republican, have of overwhelmingly Democratic New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the Republicans' efforts have significantly changed
Spitzer's lead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To recap: First, the Republicans went to court, claiming that
37,000 phantom votes from New York City had materialized in the
week after Nov. 3. They have since dropped that claim, conceding
that the unofficial election night tally was incomplete, as always,
a situation not unique to the city. The official count, released
eight days later by the City Board of Elections, was 37,000 votes
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials then told reporters that the number of
absentee ballots cast in the city was greater than the number
distributed to voters. That turned out not to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Republicans' lawyers said they had found a 7,000-vote
error in the Queens totals. Last week, Republican officials who
spoke on the condition of anonymity said that claim was probably a
product of their own counting error and they expected it to be
dropped when the case returned to State Supreme Court in Manhattan
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Republican Party has challenged the validity of
thousands of paper ballots cast in heavily Democratic election
districts over errors like a signature that dips below the line,
while in Republican strongholds, the Democrats were challenging far
fewer ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Republicans claimed that dead people, 1,000 of
them, had voted in New York City _ not enough to change the
outcome, but enough to give the whole campaign a shady cast. It
turns out that what the Republicans meant was that 1,000 people
remained on the city's voter registration rolls after they had
died, no great surprise in a city with 4 million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have not offered evidence that votes were actually
cast on behalf of the deceased.
</P>
<P>
   Among some Republicans, and among many politicians outside the
party, the prevailing theory about the claims of voting
irregularities is that Powers badly wants to shift the blame away
from himself. Republican activists around the state grumble that
the party ran no get-out-the-vote operation to speak of, relying
almost entirely on television advertising, and that this factor
cost Vacco the election.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout by Republican voters was lower, and by Democrats higher,
than in the last few non-presidential elections, and it showed in
the final results. Among Republican candidates, Gov. George Pataki,
ahead in public opinion polls by 30 percentage points, won by 20
instead. U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, who seemed to have been in a
tight battle, lost decisively. And Vacco, who appeared to have had
a comfortable lead, ended up in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeing is an orchestrated endeavor to cover the
fact that the Republican statewide party ran a dismal campaign,''
said Raymond Harding, chairman of the Liberal Party, which
nominated Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   With Pataki facing only feeble opposition, the party's top
priority this year was re-electing D'Amato. The Republicans adhered
to their conventional strategy in close midterm elections of
striving for a low turnout in urban areas. Not only did it not help
the senator, but it also probably hurt Vacco.
</P>
<P>
   In one of those urban areas, in and around the attorney
general's hometown, Buffalo, he is well known and popular. In 1994,
when Vacco won office in a race almost as close as this one,
turnout in Erie County was higher than it was this year, and he
carried the county by 95,000 votes, more than double his margin
there this year. If he had won the county this year by the same
number of votes he did four years ago, he would be drafting a
second inaugural speech, not maneuvering in court to keep his
political career alive.

 &HT;    Mind over matter crucial for Falcons
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Maybe the question here today when Atlanta plays the
Rams is not whether the Falcons can win without Chris Chandler at
quarterback, but if they think they can win with someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's ankle is sprained badly enough that he almost
certainly won't play after not practicing this week. Second-year
man Tony Graziani took most of the snaps with the No. 1 offense
late in the week, and it appears he'll get the second start of his
career. A chance also remains that 44-year-old Steve DeBerg could
get his second start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves hasn't said.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons (9-2) are good when Chandler starts and finishes,
amassing a 14-4 record dating back to last year. But when he
doesn't play _ and he's missed or been injured of one of every
three games since joining the Falcons _ Atlanta is just 2-7,
including 0-3 when he's out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   When he missed the Oct. 25 game against the Jets, Atlanta got
smoked 28-3. A few days later offensive players admitted they went
into that game thinking they could win _ if everything went perfect
with DeBerg at quarterback. Instead, the offense was universally
lifeless.
</P>
<P>
   So what's more important? Who's at quarterback, or the passion
of players around him?
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time there was more of an emphasis of playing
without Chris,'' said wide receiver Terance Mathis. ``This time, I
think this team has more confidence we can win no matter who is in
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziani's mobility could come in handy against a Rams team with
37 sacks, but perhaps just as importantly, being last year's
seventh-round draft choice year may make it imperative he play.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious, hopefully, DeBerg, 44, isn't going to be around
next year to back up Chandler. The Falcons need to figure out if
Graziani should be back.
</P>
<P>
   If they lose to their NFC West opponent today, the Falcons could
lost their grip of first place, and allow the 49ers (8-3) to gain a
tiebreaker edge. Lost today and Atlanta will have two division
losses to San Francisco's one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's overdue,'' said Graziani. ``We haven't won when
(Chandler) hasn't started. (Through more than a year of practice,
preseason, and the cameo role against the Jets) your reads get
faster, your drops get quicker. I feel I've improved a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBerg said, ``This team is good enough to win without Chris.
Maybe not against the elite teams in the NFL, but we have an
outstanding defense and a good running game.''
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't sound reassuring, consider the matchup of
Anderson versus the Rams, who've lost Atlanta three straight times
and 12 of 16.
</P>
<P>
   He rushed for a career-high 172 yards and two touchdowns in a
37-15 win four weeks ago, and 162 yards in a 34-31 win last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not worrying about (quarterback) because Jamal is
the guy right now,'' said St. Louis middle linebacker Eric Hill.
``I don't want to take anything away from him, but we're a lot
better than we showed.''

 &HT;    Safe stand ensures hunting success
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell and Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   THIS WEEK'S TIP
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shumaker of Dawsonville bagged a trophy 10-point, 160-pound
deer last week in Madison County. One of the keys to getting it,
says Shumaker, a jokester, is staying in the tree stand. Or not
falling out. ``Every time you hunt, inspect your stand and make
sure it's safe,'' he said. ``And don't ever climb into it carrying
a rifle.'' Shumaker recommended tying a line on the rifle and
pulling it into the stand after you are seated and secured with a
safety belt.
</P>
<P>
   BRAGGING RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Native Atlantan Bill Carson, 41, has hunted since he was 12, but
never before has he taken such a magnificent buck as the 220-pound
11-pointer he took Nov. 21 on a 5,000-acre farm in Dooly County,
one of the Wildlife Resources Division's quality-management
counties, near Lake Blackshear.
</P>
<P>
   It shows what the program can do. By setting a minimum on antler
size, deer have time to grow and mature into such specimens, which
scored 138-plus on the Boone &AMP; Crockett big-game system.
</P>
<P>
   Deer already are rutting in the area. Carson said there was a
scrape under almost every oak limb that hung over a service road
bordering the hay field.
</P>
<P>
   Deer that big are wary, and Carson had more than his share of
luck. He decided at 6 a.m. to move his stand and had just finished
setting it up when he heard a noise _ other than what he was
making.
</P>
<P>
   ``To my disbelief, (there) was the buck, walking fast down one
of the rows of pine trees paralleling the hay field (near his
original setup),'' Carson said.
</P>
<P>
   He took the deer with one shot at 80 yards. Carson was using a
Browning .30-06 bolt action with a Leopold 3x9 Veri-X II scope and
was using 135-grain Nosler ballistic tip bullets.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-point rack has a 19-inch spread. All tines were more than
seven inches long, and two were more than 10 inches.
</P>
<P>
   UNBREAKABLE RECORD?
</P>
<P>
   It's been so long since George Perry caught the world-record
largemouth bass (22 pounds, 4 ounces in 1932) that access to the
lake where he caught it _ Lake Montgomery, an oxbow of the Ocmulgee
River _ is nearly impossible unless the river level is up or you're
willing to hike through the woods.
</P>
<P>
   The same has been said about the chances of the next record
coming out of Georgia, according to a report in the
December-January issue of In-Fisherman magazine. It's nearly
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The report, entitled ``The Golden Age of Giant Largemouth
Bass,'' takes an informative state-by-state look at trophy
largemouth fishing and takes a guess at which state has the best
odds. Georgia has a one-in-150 chance of producing the next record,
according to the magazine. Like most Southeastern states, Georgia's
biggest bass _ 13 to 15 pounds _ mainly come from private ponds.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance of breaking a record? California, where stocked
Florida bass are making trophy lakes out of Castaic, Casitas and
Clear lakes. California's odds stand stand at 4-1, mainly because
of the number of fish of more than 17 pounds caught in the past
decade. Bob Cruppi's 22.01-pounder caught on Castaic in 1991 still
stirs talk, but large catches there have trailed off. Casitas is
producing the state's bass the past few years. Also, although not
officially recognized, a 24-pounder caught and released in a Spring
Lake, is further evidence that there's big bass out West.
</P>
<P>
   Other top odds: Florida (7-1), Texas (10-1), Louisiana (30-1).
Thirty-two states were given no line, meaning no chance at all.
</P>
<P>
   HITS AND MISSES
</P>
<P>
   The popular wintertime technique of spoon jigging has been
knocking the hybrids dead on Lake Allatoona, according to Ted
Gambrell of the Dugout in Marietta. Allen Brooks caught and
released 75 hybrids last week using the lure, mostly on long
points. ... The bombing run on Lake Lanier _ throwing Long A
Bombers to the shoreline and slowly retrieving _ has not been very
explosive this fall, as the moody stripers are still acting
finicky. Live bait, especially trout, have been effective, however.
Stripers also have been striking jumbo shiners, bucktails, Super
Flukes and Zara Spooks, among other lures and baits. A 24-pounder
was weighed in at Hammond's Fishing Center, while a 26-pound caught
by Randy Dover of Buford came in at the Dam Store.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE NEWSSTAND
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial subject a Georgian can bring up in a
crowd _ other than politics and religion _ is what is the best
rifle for hunting deer. The December issue of Field &AMP; Stream
magazine has its opinion on the rifle, plus 25 other items picked
by a panel of the magazine's editors from around the country that
should keep the conversations warm around campfires, bait shops and
marinas until January. The panel's choice for a rifle: Marlin's
Model 1895 Guide Gun.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE BIRDS
</P>
<P>
   The return of the seagulls and loons to Lake Lanier is a good
sign for even the less knowledgable angler. Find the birds and
you've got a good chance of finding fish and bait, according to
guide Bill Vanderford. Signs indicate that striper fishing on the
lake may be picking up, too. Schools of stripers can be seen
chasing baitfish on or near the surface from around Lake Lanier
Islands to as far north as Wahoo Creek and Little River. They'll
hit bucktails, Fluke-type plastic minnows, or most any large, live
baitfish within 10 feet of the surface. Early morning or during the
evening hours, one can try a topwater lure like the Zara Spook.

 &HT;    2 die while hunting in 1998
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell and Scott Bernarde
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Rangers have recorded 36 hunting accidents and
two fatalities so far in 1998, according to the Wildlife Resources
Division of the state Department of Natural Resources. Figures
include the current deer and waterfowl seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five accidents and one fatality involved deer hunters
falling out of tree stands. The other fatality was an accidentally
self-inflicted wound.
</P>
<P>
   The state has had six shooter-victim accidents.
</P>
<P>
   One involved a father shooting his son. The father was hunting
alone and wasn't aware his son was coming into the woods.
Obviously, he didn't see his target clearly and must have been
shooting at movement, a violation of one of the basic rules of
hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Without tree-stand accidents, however, hunting looks relatively
safe, with 11 accidents and one fatality among a group of 400,000
people in the woods with guns.

   Controlling geese
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's beleaguered lake-dwellers and golfers might learn from
Oregon how to control the Canada goose. Beginning next month, the
Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife will give farmers a list of
hunters willing to come onto their fields and shoot the offending
birds, which do considerable damage to wheat. They are trying to
steer geese off croplands and into wildlife refuges. ``Geese aren't
dumb,'' said Chris Vandenberg, the program coordinator. ``When they
fly into a field and get shot at a couple of times, they are a
whole lot less likely to come back.'' Oregon's problem is with
wintering geese. Georgia's Canadas are homegrown and the problem is
year-round and growing. Geese are grazers and they eat like sheep,
yanking plants out of wet soil and trampling seedlings.

   Record footage?
</P>
<P>
   You can get a chance to see a possible record bow-and-arrow
whitetail deer kill tonight on the Outdoors Channel's ``Outdoor
Adventures with Denny Guerink'' (7 p.m.), which will show footage

   The Bass Anglers Sportsman Society is offering a series of BASS
fishing classes beginning in January. Thirty-six two-day seminars
are scheduled, including one Jan. 23-24 hosted by Kennesaw State
University. The class, to be held at Wyndham Garden Hotel in
Kennesaw, will be taught by pro anglers on various aspects of bass
fishing. The registration fee is $89, with a fee for a spouse or a
child under 16 of $44.50. For information, call 770-423-6765.

 &HT;    Former Clemson coach off to rough at Texas
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia faced Texas twice in the opening month of
last season, but the Bulldogs will play a vastly different
Longhorns team in Austin, Texas, today.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Longhorns, who lost both games to the Bulldogs
last November, are off to their worst start since going 0-6 in
1974-75. Texas, under first-year coach Rick Barnes, formerly of
Clemson, has dropped games to Houston, South Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns are struggling to adapt to Barnes' defensive
style, shooting just 36.8 percent from the floor and committing 19
turnovers per game. Barnes replaced longtime coach Tom Penders, who
resigned in April after a well-publicized player revolt. Penders is
now at George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one area that we don't need to improve at,''
Barnes said. ``We have to learn to play hard all the time. I'm
going to do a better job of substituting players, getting guys to
play hard two, three minutes at a time. We've got to learn to play
defense. We'll find a way to score points. I'm the kind of guy who
wants to challenge every shot, win every possession, run teams out
of their offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' first task was instilling discipline. In a team meeting
on the day he was announced as coach, Barnes banned all facial
hair, earrings, wearing hats in buildings and wearing headphones on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has been hurt by the departure of two players _ highly
regarded wing man Luke Axtell, who transferred to Kansas, and guard
Bernard Smith, who left for Houston. Axtell was suspended by
Penders last season for academic reasons, and Axtell then quit the
team after a former assistant released his grades to a local radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was expected to start at point guard before he left in
August. The situation worsened when highly regarded recruit
Nathaniel Bailey didn't academically qualify. Junior William Clay
has taken over at point, allowing senior DeJuan Vazquez to move to
shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns are led by forwards Gabe Muoneke, who is averaging
18.7 points and eight rebounds, and Kris Clack, a senior who's
averaging 14.3 points and nine rebounds. Sophomore center Chris
Mihm is among the nation's top shot blockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got great athletic ability,'' Georgia coach Ron Jirsa
said. ``Between the two forwards, they're getting almost 30 points
a game. Clack is a sure NBA prospect on the wing. They're at home
and they're 0-3. Their backs are against the wall, so we've got to
realize that they're going to play extremely hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia faces a tough three-game stretch. The Bulldogs won't
return to Athens until Monday morning, leaving them just one day of
practice to prepare for West Virginia. After playing in Morgantown,
W.Va., on Wednesday, the Bulldogs face Furman in Stegeman Coliseum
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really only got one day to turn it around and (play West
Virginia),'' Jirsa said. ``It's going to be important for us to
realize how vital these games are for the entire season outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   SCOUTING REPORT: GEORGIA AT TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   When, where: Today, 7 p.m., Erwin Center, Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: Fox SportSouth, WSB (750 AM), WNGC (95.5 FM).
</P>
<P>
   Coaches: Ron Jirsa is 23-16 in second season at Georgia; Rick
Barnes is 0-3 in first season at Texas, 202-137 in 12 years
overall.
</P>
<P>
   Records: Georgia 3-1; Texas 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   Series: Georgia leads 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Last meeting: Georgia won 94-76 in Athens on Nov. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Texas update: The Longhorns have struggled in Barnes' first
season, dropping their first three games to Houston, South Florida
and Arizona. Texas is shooting just 36.8 percent from the floor and
committing 19 turnovers per game. In the Longhorns' 73-57 loss at
Arizona on Wednesday, they shot only 33 percent and committed 20
turnovers. Forward Gabe Muoneke is leading the team with 18.7
points and eight rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Probable lineups: Georgia _ Guards, G.G. Smith (Sr., 5 feet 10)
and Ray Harrison (Sr., 6-2); center, Robb Dryden (So., 7-1);
forwards, Jumaine Jones (So., 6-7) and Michael Chadwick (Sr., 6-4).
Texas _ Guards, DeJuan Vazquez (Sr., 6-4) and William Clay (Jr.,
6-2); center, Chris Mihm (So., 7-foot); forwards, Gabe Muoneke
(Jr., 6-7) and Kris Clack (Sr., 6-5).
</P>
<P>
   Injuries: Georgia _ guard Adrian Jones (foot) is out for season.
Texas _ none reported.

 &HT;    Coaches miss season more than fans
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe the fans don't miss the NBA _ every survey
confirms it _ but there's no question that absence from the game is
driving the league's top coaches crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Lenny Wilkens said the lockout has colored his view
of retirement. Although it's four years away, the Hawks coach
already dreads the free time he can have at age 66. Now, add the
Celtics' Rick Pitino and the Heat's Pat Riley to the number that no
longer can imagine life without a team to coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said up until this point that I'm going to coach
until I'm about 52 or 53 and then look at some front-office
stuff,'' Pitino said. ``Now that I realize what it's like being
out, I want to coach until I'm about 62 or 65. Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino had dabbled in horse racing, TV and played golf, but it
cannot obscure his love for coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always questioned guys like Mike Fratello,'' Pitino said.
``They have a great TV job, so why did they get back into coaching?
And now I realize (that) when you don't have it, it kills you not
to be a part of it. So this taught me a lot. For me, it's a great
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, 'Why don't you go into TV commentating some day?'
But coaching's my niche, and I would miss basketball too much to be
away from it. That's what this has taught me. I can't be away from
it. I can't live without it.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley spent a year away from coaching as an NBC analyst after he
left the Lakers. ``I hated it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And although Riley said last season he did not think he could be
a coaching lifer like Bill Fitch, he has changed his mind. He is in
the business for the long haul, probably with the Heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you get to a point where you get sort of
comfortable,'' Riley said. ``I've been in for 17 years now. I don't
have any anxiety anymore. Since I've come here, I feel a love to
coach more than ever. Maybe it's the age. I'm just sort of settling
in. I like it here. To build this organization, it's a different
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Door's open
</P>
<P>
   Hawks rookie Roshown McLeod was on the court at Duke in
September when Christian Laettner tore his Achilles' tendon. ``He
got a pass, went to make a move to the basket all by himself and
went down,'' McLeod recalled. ``He said I think, 'I tore my
Achilles`.' None of us believed him because he didn't show any pain
on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   While Laettner, a free agent, recuperates, agent Lon Babby
protests the assumption that he's locked in for Detroit.
``Christian hasn't ruled out any team, and he certainly hasn't
turned his back on the Hawks. He's still very interested in
returning to Atlanta and, remember, Atlanta can do more for him
than any other team, under the current rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Laettner, by the way, saved money when he dumped agent Herb
Rudoy, who takes 4 percent of his client's contract. Babby bills by
the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Bad air
</P>
<P>
   Here's NBA attorney Jeffrey Mishkin's unpromising view of labor
negotiations: ``We can't agree on the shape of the table. We can't
agree on what we have agreed to, and that's not a conducive
atmosphere for productive negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Mishkin's take on the death of Saturday's
negotiations differs from the union's. According to the league's
chief counsel, Billy Hunter became inflexible on key points, thus
making talks so unpromising they were canceled. Specifically, it is
alleged that Hunter said the players would not take less than 57
percent of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Money
</P>
<P>
   Under the NBA's proposed system of capping the highest salaries,
the league would never again see a $100 million contract. They
would take Kevin Garnett's six-year, $126 million deal from
Minnesota and put it in a museum for foolishness. Assuming the
salary cap is $32 million this season, here are the maximum deals
available to players in three categories, under the owners'
proposal. The two sets of figures represent the contracts players
could sign with their originating teams as ``Larry Bird
exceptions'' and what they could get on the open market:
</P>

   Not surprisingly, the Spurs' David Robinson says he's opposed to
the concept. ``Nobody is going to accept that,'' Robinson said.
``It would be a huge mistake to limit the top guys' salaries. If
you say (to Tim Duncan), 'Tim, you can only make $9 million on your
next contract,' what happens then? You immediately restrict
salaries of guys in the lesser category than Tim. You say if you're
an owner, 'Well, Avery (Johnson), we're paying Tim $9 million, you
should get about $1.5 million. All the salaries will fall.
Everything is really measured according to the top salaries.''

   Magic Johnson cleared $75,000 doing an autograph show in Detroit
last weekend. Oh, but he didn't do it because he needed the money.
</P>
<P>
   According to Darren Prince, one of Johnson's booking agents,
Johnson periodically puts out fresh signatures so that his
collectibles will not fall prey to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people out there ripping these guys off with phony
signatures,'' Prince told the Detroit News. ``If you see a Magic
autograph going for $20 or $30, you know it's a fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity
</P>
<P>
   Taking an optimistic view that there will be a season, the
Pacers are emerging as the favorites in the East. Among the reasons
is team unity. You might have heard that as many as 11 players from
last season's team have been working out together. That includes
free-agent center Rik Smits, who is expected to re-sign with the
Pacers. ``We don't have the coaches pushing us,'' Antonio Davis
said. ``We're pushing ourselves. The guys want to be as ready as
possible. The only way we can savor anything is to get together and
work out as much as possible.'' Call it another ``Larry Bird
exception.''

 &HT;    Keeping Oilers ahead
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The best architect in hockey is doing it again. He
lost his starting goalie to free agency. He lost his best offensive
weapon twice, first to a contract holdout, then to knee surgery. He
has long since lost his ammunition to a shrinking economy that
finds ``Canadian dollar'' a contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   But Glen Sather still wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Edmonton Oilers started last week in first place in the
NHL's Northwest Division. It has helped that the Colorado
Avalanche, a team with double the Oilers' payroll, limped out of
the gate; but that the Oilers are even above .500 is a credit to
Sather's eye for young, inexpensive talent and his ability to stay
a step ahead of most other NHL executives in the direction of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, I'd like to have more money to spend,'' said the
general manager of the Oilers, whose payroll of $21.938 million
ranks 23rd among 27 teams. ``But even if I had been in Atlanta and
I had the budget that team may or may not have, I still would not
have paid (goalie) Curtis Joseph $24 million for four years. I
think you're a lot better off getting a group of young guys
together, teach them about the game and about life and bring them
along. You're much better off than trying to hit a home run with a
bunch of 30-year-old free agents.''
</P>
<P>
   When the week started, the Oilers had twice as many wins as the
New York Rangers, whose payroll of $39.783 million was
third-highest in the NHL and 81 percent higher than Edmonton's.
Sather was GM of five Stanley Cup champions _ he also coached four
of them _ with a group of kids who eventually found riches
elsewhere. They include Wayne Gretzky, Mark Messier, Paul Coffey,
Grant Fuhr, Jari Kurri, Glenn Anderson and Kevin Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers upset Colorado in the playoffs last season, then lost
Joseph to Toronto. Forward Doug Weight, the team's leading scorer,
will have played only four games by the time he returns to the
lineup in late January, having torn up a knee a week after
returning from protracted contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Edmonton continues to get strong play from Bill Guerin, whom
Sather stole from New Jersey in a trade last year, and has received
surprisingly excellent goaltending from Mikhail Shtalenkov, who
cost Sather only a fifth-round pick in a trade with expansion
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   At times this past offseason, some people wondered if Sather
would be back in Edmonton. Rumors long had swirled that the
franchise, in financial straits, would be moved, while owner Peter
Pocklington had sold the team to a group of 26 owners. Even after
new owners vowed to keep the team in Alberta, Sather, who earns
approximately $1 million, was uncertain of his role.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers were among a few clubs that approached Sather,
although his conversations were with team vice president Dave
Maggard, not president Harvey Schiller. The Thrashers were
uncertain how serious Sather was about the job and thought that he
wanted to stay in Edmonton. They hired Don Waddell instead.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sather admits, ``The first thing I thought of was loyalty
to the city of Edmonton. I didn't want to seem like a carpetbagger
at this stage. I was responsible for this franchise for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the Thrashers concluded that Sather wasn't gettable, they
were mistaken. Sather said he would have ``loved the chance'' to
build a team from scratch _ if the conditions were right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of working for Ted Turner would have been very
exciting for me,'' he said. ``He's one guy I've always had great
esteem for. I've read a lot about him. He's an interesting guy.
I've always liked Atlanta as a city. They'll have a great building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to them a couple of times. It just seemed a little, I
don't know, restrictive. I report to a board of directors here. But
they know me.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Sather was assured he would remain in control of the
Oilers, he didn't believe he could get the same situation in
Atlanta. Sather's comfort level is such that he occasionally takes
brief respites at his offseason home in Palm Springs, Calif.,
during the season, usually when the Oilers are on a West Coast
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Sather defends the practice. He can talk on the phone and catch
just as many games on a satellite dish in Palm Springs as he can in
Edmonton. Besides, he said, ``It's just as easy to fly some place
out of Palm Springs as it is Edmonton.

 &HT;    Beanie Babies, bad bank statements plague Penguins
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A woman attending a Beanie Baby giveaway at a recent
Penguins game tried to obtain one of the stuffed animals on the
pretense it was for her infant son. She was denied _ after it was
determined that the ``infant'' she had wrapped in a blanket was a
Teddy bear.
</P>
<P>
   If that had been Pittsburgh's only off-ice headache last week,
things wouldn't be so bad. But there's more in bankruptcy central.
The latest:
</P>
<P>
   _ Co-owner Roger Marino admits in recent depositions what others
have suspected, that he has been in contact with other cities about
moving the team as early as the end of this season. The hit list:
Cleveland; Houston; Kansas City, Mo.; Little Rock; Milwaukee;
Portland, Ore.; Salt Lake City; Seattle; and Las Vegas. ``Nobody
wants to leave,'' team attorney Michael Kaminsky said. ``We just
want to ... compare the Civic Arena lease with other leases.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Details of the Penguins' $127 million debt include $3.8
million in signing bonuses to 10 current players in the minors or
juniors and $5.99 million in deferred payments to six roster
players, as well as $33 million to Mario Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   _ The next 10 paychecks to players on the current roster will
come courtesy of a bank in France, after a $20 million loan was
secured by the team and approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is speculation the team might leave high-priced goalie
Tom Barrasso unprotected for the Thrashers in June's expansion
draft. Behind Barrasso, the Pens have three young goalies _ Peter
Skudra, Jean-Sebastian Aubin, Craig Hillier _ and the veteran is
making $2.7 million per year. He is scheduled to become an
unrestricted free agent after the 1999-2000 season, which might
dissuade the Thrashers from pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment
</P>
<P>
   The most startling development in last week's free-for-all
between Washington and Boston _ which resulted in 44 penalties
totaling 270 minutes _ was the decision by referee Mark Faucette to
eject all 12 players participating in a first-period brawl. ``I
suppose if you go strictly by the rules, the ejections were
proper,'' Bruins general manager Harry Sinden said. ``But suppose
you have the same thing happen in the next period? Do you call off
the game? The officials have to use some common sense.'' Caps left
winger Craig Berube also was suspended for three games for ``abuse
of officials'' when it was determined he pushed a linesman to get
to a Bruins player. Such suspensions are issued by the game
officials, not by the league. Boston and Minnesota combined for 406
penalty minutes on Feb. 21, 1981, the NHL record. An amusing
postfight comment came from Caps goalie Olaf Kolzig, who squared
off with friend Byron Dafoe, Boston's goalie: ``It's tough fighting
your best friend. He went after one of our guys. I went after one
of their guys. We ended up getting together.''
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   Overkill? Doctors let Montreal's Mark Recchi extend his ironman
streak to 561 even though he was in the early stages of pneumonia.
... Buffalo killed off 78 of 85 penalties (90.6 percent) in its
first 16 games, and it's no secret why. ``We have the best penalty
killer in the league _ Dominik Hasek,'' forward Curtis Brown said.

   THRASHERS UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville Predators did not play a home exhibition this year
so that their season opener against Florida would be the team's
first game in the new Nashville Arena. Don't expect the Thrashers
to do the same. ``We'll do some preseason games here,'' team
president Harvey Schille said. ``We want to make sure everything is
ready with the arena for the season, and it has promotional value
for the people. Ticket prices also will be lower, so it's a chance
for people to come down and get a taste of things and a feel for
it, without (it) costing a lot.'' ... General manager Don Waddell
will try to use his connections with Detroit, where he served as
assistant GM, to bring the Red Wings in for an exhibition. ...
Reason for the delayed release of Thrashers jerseys: Team officials
are having trouble finding a manufacturer who can get the dark blue
and copper colors right. Expect the jerseys to be released in early
January. . . . Schiller conceded that the team is not close to
negotiating a deal for construction of a practice site, and it is
becoming more likely the team will rent ice time from an existing
rink for practices, as well as use the new arena when it's
available.
</P>
<P>
   POLICE BLOTTER
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt that new NHL vice president Colin
Campbell was on a record-setting pace for handing out suspensions,
here are the numbers. Campbell already has suspended 20 players _
four in the preseason, 16 in the regular season _ for everything
from throwing a water bottle at a fan (Chicago's Reid Simpson,
suspended one game) to cross-checking an opponent in the face
(Tampa Bay's Andrei Nazarov, seven games). Former league VP Brian
Burke suspended 27 players all of last season. League officials say
they do not keep records on suspensions for a season, but Campbell
could surpass last year's total before the All-Star break. Campbell
is defending his moves and the job Burke did last year. ``Brian is
being unfairly criticized for (being too soft),'' Campbell said.
``But he did the job that was asked of him.'' Campbell said he was
given a different mandate than Burke, which was to crack down on
hits to the head.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   Evidence indicates that rule changes finally are increasing
scoring. The overall average of 5.2 goals per game remains low, but
consider the 50-game breakdowns: 4.7 average in games one to 50;
5.0 in 51-100; 5.3 in 101-150; 5.7 in 151-200. The trend could
continue now that the NHL mandated changes in between-periods
activities beginning this past week. The ice must be resurfaced
three minutes earlier than before, allowing for more time for the
water to freeze and less time for entertainment. Players coming out
of the dressing room before the start of the period must go
directly to the bench instead of skating around, except for those
who will open the period. The goal: a faster ice surface and
quicker, more action-filled starts to the period.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Dallas right winger Mike Modano is blaming his scoring slump _
five goals in 16 games _ on the fact that his six-year, $43.5
million contract is creating financial management problems for him
off the ice. ``You try as much as you can not to bring that to the
rink. But it's tough when it weighs on you the 22 hours you're not
at the rink. Then the other two, you try to focus on hockey.'' Hey,
here's a solution: Give some of it back.

 &HT;    Nicholls tries to fend off Shark attack
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For a guy who ranks 26th on the NHL's all-time scoring
list with 1,209 points and is one of only eight players to score 70
goals in a season, Bernie Nicholls deserved a better exit than the
one he got last week.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose general manager Dean Lombardi and coach Darryl Sutter
met with Nicholls after a home game against the New York Rangers
and told him that he would not accompany the team on a four-game
trip the next day. They also told him that he had played his last
game for the Sharks, period, and suggested he retire.
</P>
<P>
   Lombardi shouldn't be expected to carry Nicholls on the roster
if he doesn't think the probable Hall of Famer can play anymore.
But how is that determination made six weeks into the season and
not before the year starts _ especially after Nicholls was given a
new contract for one year plus an option?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it was awkward in terms of timing, but we'll work
through it and get it right,'' Lombardi said.
</P>
<P>
   The team has approached Nicholls about staying on in some
capacity, but it has yet to create a job description. Nicholls is
open to the idea but wants a long-term commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made up their mind that I'm not in their plans (as a
player) and they're going to take a different route,'' Nicholls
said. ``I can respect that part. But I don't agree. I feel I can
still play. My agent said he could call teams and find a spot for
me to go. But what's best for me in the long run? If I take a job
here and it's for the long run, then it's in my best interest to
stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Cha-ching
</P>
<P>
   Many general managers and players have whined this season after
league vice president Colin Campbell handed out suspensions. But
when Campbell banished Los Angeles left winger Matt Johnson for the
year's longest punishment _ 12 games (and $95,121.95 in salary) _
Johnson was silent and Kings general manager Dave Taylor was as
meek as a puppy. After Johnson attacked New York's Jeff Beukeboom
from behind with a punch to the head, leaving him with a
concussion, Johnson alibied that he was retaliating for Beukeboom
kicking out the feet of a Kings teammate. Campbell disagreed,
because he didn't suspend Beukeboom. Johnson also qualified as a
``repeat offender,'' having been suspended four games last year for
a slashing incident.
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings might consider having A&AMP;W cater their pregame
meals. In the middle of their 2-6 slump, things seemed to get worse
for them when they had to bus nearly four hours from Calgary to
Edmonton because their plane, ``Redbird One,'' had a hole in the
fuselage. A fuel truck had backed into it. ``We drove from Calgary
to Edmonton and stopped on the way for burgers and fries at A&AMP;W,''
assistant coach Dave Lewis said. ``I think it reminded all of the
guys of their junior days, when they just played the game for the
love of it. Everybody kind of got back to basics.'' No kidding. The
Red Wings that night played one of their best games of the season,
beating the Oilers 6-2. ... Rumor mill: The Kings are talking to
Ottawa about acquiring center Radek Bonk.

   (NYT7) BEDFORD HILLS, N.Y. -- Nov. 28, 1998 -- NY-CASTLE, 11-28
-- Donald Lehman and his wife Barbara, bought the Darlington Castle
and 30 acres in Bedford for $1.5 million, a relatively low price
because of a working radio tower mounted to its roof and an
iron-clad lease that insures it will remain there until 2006. The
Lehmans now complain that Kenny G has become the soundtrack to
their lives because the station, WZZN at 106.3 FM, comes through on
every channel on the radio dial and meddles with the reception on
other equipment. (Joyce Dopkeen/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) KANKANI, India -- Nov. 28, 1998 -- INDIA-HUNTING-SUIT,
11-28 -- Kankani elders like Prahlad Ram, are among those accusing
Salman Khan, a young movie idol in India, of having poached two
antelopes. Khan's lawyer says that some villagers' love of animals
``twists their thinking.'' Ram says that his people, Bishnoi
villagers, have a duty to serve as ``protectors and nurturers of
all living things.'' Now, the Bishnoi have become national heroes
in an ecological morality play that pits simple farmers against an
Indian movie idol. (Barry Bearak/New York Times Photo)

way, it could be replaced by the blue-and-white Cross of St.
Andrew. The Nationalists have been gaining support in Scotland.
Much of the enthusiasm for the Nationalists could have to do with

<HEADLINE>
HOLIDAY CHEERS? NOT THIS PAST WEEK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thank goodness Thanksgiving week ends today. Local sports teams
couldn't take any more of this holiday abuse _ some of it
self-inflicted, some of it Moss-produced.
</P>
<P>
   There was but one confirmed winner _ the Mavericks, who have no
game or games at the moment. With nothing to screw up, they won by
not being involved.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, from the Dept. of Opinions, here's a slanted view of
the story:
</P>
<P>
   Within the Cowboys ranks, there seemed to be genuine surprise,
starting with Jerry Jones, that Nine-Toed Deion took the scratch
for Thursday. But why the surprise?
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ego prevented Sanders from participating in a
national spotlight matchup. Say the toe-sprain reduced him to 90
percent _ if Randy Moss burns Deion, he loses luster and face.
</P>
<P>
   Did you think this was about the team? Instead, focus on
reputation, a new contract and Being Deion. Then again, Sanders
will now have had two full weeks to recover, setting him up for the
December stretch run, and maybe a January rematch with the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Not all bad, frankly.
</P>
<P>
   Gall-of-the-week winner was easily the Rangers. Talk about no
shame in jacking up 1999 ticket prices another 20 percent _ the
third consecutive off-season for a price increase, all of them in
the 20 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   When club officials were begging for stadium votes seven years
ago, they successfully sold that Arlington election with one key
point: the new ballpark would be so prosperous it would absorb
growing players' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, fan-gouging is yearly and rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Score this as the first negative P.R. for the Tom Hicks
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Honk, Doug Melvin, if you're still alive. What a nice Rangers'
scam _ shut out in free agency thus far while also reaching into
the fans' hip-pocket.
</P>
<P>
   That hip-pocket reach works both way. The Stars are stealing
Hicks' money.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the good NHL teams normally half-skate through November,
but there's a difference between that and loafing. Too many times
lately, the Stars have appeared disinterested in the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you, Darryl Sydor, for publicly citing ``arrogance,'' and
``a lack of respect'' for the opponent. Someone in the Stars'
locker room needed to say it.
</P>
<P>
   According to several players, Chan Gailey's postgame locker room
comments to the team centered on ``next time.'' In other words, he
voiced confident eagerness about trying the Vikings again in the
playoffs. But health or no health, the Cowboys will lose again if
the stupid offensive penalties and dropped passes don't cease.
</P>
<P>
   How confused was the Cowboys' makeshift secondary on
Thanksgiving? Consider one critical third quarter play: With the
Vikings facing third-and-18 from their own 38, Dave Campo called
for the dreaded three-man rush (it never works, Dave.) That meant
eight pass defenders as Randall Cunningham heaved the ball deep and
up for grabs. Incredibly, Kenny Wheaton still ended up singled
against Moss, and drew the pass interference at the 12-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   That set up the game-turning touchdown. The Cowboys were down
24-19 when Wheaton took that penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Birth of a receiver. My, my, what have the Cowboys found in
Patrick Jeffers? The son of an Arlington gynecologist who prepped
at Fort Worth Country Day, Jeffers was picked up for nothing from
Denver late in the summer. Troy Aikman, for one, has privately said
Jeffers, tall with speed, is a ``player,'' and that was before the
past two games.
</P>
<P>
   Credit receivers coach Dwain Painter with the acquisition of
Jeffers. Painter was on Denver's staff last season.
</P>
<P>
   One good theory on the Stars. With 11 of the first 18 games at
Reunion, and with two five-day breaks in the schedule in the first
six weeks, it's a team that has spent way too much time at home.
</P>
<P>
   Tee times, wifes, kids and girlfriends tend to limit hockey
concentration. A test for the homebody theory is coming quickly.
Ten of the 15 games in December are on the road, followed by eight
of 12 in January.
</P>
<P>
   How do the Rangers explain higher ticket prices if they don't
sign Randy Johnson? Even if they do, while the explanation will be
easier, that doesn't make it valid.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting sight of the week: Moss, with his head down, and a
ballcap also pulled tight on his head, mumbling into the Madden
turkey after Thursday's game. Pat \RSummerall\S and John \RMadden\S
had their postgame questions, but Moss had few answers and little
interest in talking on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, that was still more than he wanted to say to the
media in the locker room. Moss snarled and cursed at TV reporters.
Greatness on the field is one thing. Acting like a punk is another.

   CURRIE _ The next era in space exploration is set to begin Dec.
3, and a former Troy, Ohio resident _ astronaut Nancy Currie _ will
play a key role. On Dec. 3, Currie and her crewmates will blast off
on space shuttle Discovery to begin the biggest space construction
project in history, the International Space Station. Hailed as the
next step in human space exploration and denounced as a boondoggle,
the station will be bigger than a football field and house up to
seven astronauts for months at a time when it is completed about
six years from now. Since announced by President Reagan in 1984,
the program has been plagued by cost overruns, delays and
redesigns. The biggest problem now is Russia's economic crisis.
Russia is responsible for major parts of the station, but its work
is underfunded and behind schedule. (Gaffney, Dayton Daily News).

CREDIT (undated) _ Free money! A new tax break is like a winning
lottery ticket for some Arizona schools. Too bad everyone's not a
winner, say the critics. The windfall could easily add up to tens
of millions of dollars, thanks to a law that allows taxpayers to
donate up to $200 for extra-curricular activities and subtract the
full amount from their state income tax bill. By KATHLEEN INGLEY
and CATHY CRENO. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CACTUS (undated) _ This was supposed to be a story about the
world's fattest cactus, a really obese specimen rooted near Picacho
Peak. Based on a reliable tip, momentous journalism plans were set
in motion. The monster would be dubbed El Gordo and crowned the
Sumo of Succulents. The thing would be declared an Arizona
landmark. Roseanne would do a show about her botanical soulmate . .
. Oops. It turns out El Gordo is not the world's most corpulent
cactus. Nor is it the heaviest, tallest, happiest or ugliest.
Barrel cactuses grow taller and wider in Mexico. So forget about El
Gordo. This story is about the whole world of spiny succulents.
It's a compendium of facti about cacti, drawn from experts and
books. By DENNIS WAGNER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NIGHT-CHILD (undated ) _ When night falls, the Collin Cassinat hour
begins. As other children take cover from the darkness, Collin's
playtime is just beginning. Under the moonlight, he races his bike,
catches frogs, hunts bugs and exhilarates in his freedom. Sunshine
is no friend to Collin. Exposures of just minutes would cause his
skin to redden, burn and blister. An overdose would kill him.
Collin, 9, is a child of the night. Born with a genetic disorder
called xeroderma pigmentosum, in which the cells of the body lack
the ability to repair DNA damage from ultraviolet rays, Collin's
best chance for survival is to avoid all sunlight. By BARBARA YOST.

nearby, and disagreed. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the

 &HT;    Home for troubled kids causing problems for teen's loved ones
 &HT;    By Rachel Sauer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. _ There are troubled kids, kids who break
the law and lie to their friends and make their parents cry.
</P>
<P>
   There are kids who slip quietly into invisibility, who are
wallpaper at school and ghosts around their peers, whose names
nobody can remember.
</P>
<P>
   There are kids who shrivel up and drift away because the right
people don't care.
</P>
<P>
   By almost every account, Matthew Grise is none of those kids.
</P>
<P>
   He is serious around adults and silly around his friends, a
straight A student and an athlete who can pitch 13 strike-outs in
seven innings. By almost every account, he's the student teachers
want in class, the guy people want for a friend, the 15-year-old
adults actually like.
</P>
<P>
   Because of who he is, his friends are showering politicians in
three states with letters pleading for help, local preachers are
including him in their prayers over the pulpit and his 70-year-old
grandmother, Joan Grise, is currently in Independence, Mo., trying
to do something - anything - for Matt.
</P>
<P>
   Since July, Matt has been incarcerated at the New Bethany
Baptist Church juvenile compound near Arcadia, La., a facility run
by the controversial and secretive Rev. Mack Ford. A
self-proclaimed proponent of corporeal punishment based on his
interpretation of the Bible, Ford has been accused of child abuse
many times in the 27 years he has run juvenile compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Matt has no documented history of illegal, violent, antisocial
or even disruptive behavior, and is not legally required to be
there.
</P>
<P>
   But Matt's father and step-mother, Vincent and Tami Russo,
reportedly told Matt's friends and family that he is a ``bad seed''
and a ``pathological liar'' and sent him to New Bethany allegedly
to be reformed. Friends say nothing is further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt is a delightful child,'' said Cindy Bentley, whose son,
David, became Matt's close friend when the two were students at
Scenic Elementary School. ``To say he is troubled or a liar or a
bad kid is absolutely ridiculous. He's a wonderful boy and he
shouldn't be where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   None of his friends or extended family can tell him that,
though, because the only people allowed contact with Matt under
Ford's strict rules are Vincent Russo and the people who run the
New Bethany compound.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ford or his staff declined interviews with The Daily
Sentinel on four occasions, but accounts from various people who
have been to New Bethany describe it as a well-maintained juvenile
compound with a school, a working farm and 10-foot chain-link
fences topped by razor wire.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Haynes, an employee of the Hope Youth Ranch in nearby
Minden, La., who has been to New Bethany, said guards with German
shepherds patrol the grounds and ``I got the feeling they (the
people who run New Bethany) were kind of cultish.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got their own people and they don't like anybody from
the outside on their grounds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So it's not the kind of place where you just walk in and say,
'Hi, I'm Uncle Payson and I'd like to talk to Matt,' `` said Payson
Grise, Matt's uncle. ``I have no idea what he's doing there except
Vince and Tami think he should be there. We're all really worried
about what could be happening to him, and Libba, well, this would
be her worst nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree on that: Sarah Elizabeth ``Libba'' Grise
feared nothing as she approached death except that something would
happen to her son to lessen his happiness or tangle the path of his
life. She died in October 1995 at age 46 after an extended struggle
with cancer, having first made arrangements she thought would see
Matt through to adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Walker, Libba's close friend, said Libba worried only
that Matt's father, Vincent Russo, might do something to complicate
Matt's life. Russo, after four requests for an interview, agreed to
talk to The Daily Sentinel, but then failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   When Libba and Russo met in Snowmass in 1982, Libba had already
lived in Colorado for 10 years and was ready to settle down, her
friends said. She moved to Snowmass from Ohio in 1972, maybe
looking for adventure, her brother, Payson, said. She worked as a
housekeeper, housekeeping supervisor and daycare provider in Aspen,
Snowmass and Carbondale, making friends, learning how to ski and
having fun in her free time, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were instant friends,'' Walker said of Libba. ``She was a
happy woman. I never heard her raise her voice except at baseball
games. There's a picture of her in the front of the cookbook she
helped put together for her church and when I see that smile I
think, 'That's Libba, that smile on her face.' ``
</P>
<P>
   She loved children, Walker said, and met Russo, who was a
construction worker, in Carbondale in 1982 because she was taking
care of his two daughters. In 1983 she became pregnant with Matt
and had him Nov. 9. She told friends that was the best day of her
life.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with Russo, whom she never married, was rocky,
Payson Grise said, and ended when Matt was still a toddler. Before
that, though, when Matt was barely a year old, Libba was diagnosed
with cancer after seeing her physician about a lump on her neck.
</P>
<P>
   The financial strain of radiation therapy added to the expense
of raising a child on a limited income was almost overwhelming,
``but Libba was one of the most stubborn people I've ever met. She
was determined to make things work,'' Walker said, adding that the
Grise family is very close and pulled together around Libba.
</P>
<P>
   About a year later, Libba entered a remission that lasted almost
five years. While she was still healthy, she and Matt moved to
Grand Junction, where Matt started school at Scenic Elementary and
she started a day-care business.
</P>
<P>
   Libba and Matt had a good relationship, friends said: They told
each other corny jokes, went to the park and double-checked Matt's
homework. Libba taught Matt to say please and thank you and excuse
me and that he still would have to mow the lawn despite his
grumbling. He showed her he could match her work ethic by bringing
home straight A's and pitching shutout games for his baseball team.
To Libba's pleasure, her son was tall and sandy-haired like her.
</P>
<P>
   They were good together, Bentley said, ``but I can remember one
time when I was volunteering in his first-grade class, seeing him
at his desk with his hands over his eyes, crying. I asked him what
was wrong and he said they'd just drawn pictures of their families
and he told me he was the only one in the class without a father.''
</P>
<P>
   That probably wasn't quite true, but Matt was very aware of not
having a dad. Walker said Matt had only occasional contact with
Russo, even after Libba's cancer returned several years after she
and Matt moved to Grand Junction.
</P>
<P>
   As Libba's health got worse - she eventually had to have her
voice box removed as a last-ditch effort to slow the spreading
cancer - she willed herself to be strong for her son, friends said,
and Matt did the same for his mother. She and Matt remained active
at Redlands United Methodist Church and she helped organize a
church cookbook to raise money for a building project. Kathy
Carlson, who during that time was Christian education director for
the church, said church members became an extended family for Libba
and Matt.
</P>
<P>
   Matt still got good grades and did normal boy stuff as he
watched his mother die, staying with the Bentleys when she had to
go to Denver for treatment. When there was nothing left to do and
she knew she was shrinking into a person Matt wouldn't recognize,
Libba took a deep breath and hugged her son tight and sent him to
live with his Uncle Payson and Aunt Sharlene in Rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Before she died, Libba asked her friend, attorney Martelle
Daniels, to draw up a will for her. In it she specified that she
wanted Matt to live with Payson and Sharlene Grise, but chose not
to pursue formal guardianship for them because she feared Russo
might take that as his cue to seek custody, Payson Grise said.
</P>
<P>
   The only effect of designating a guardian in a will rather than
through legal action is to state the preference of that person in
future court proceedings, Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Russo came to Libba's funeral but didn't have much contact
afterward, Payson Grise said. Matt started building a life with his
aunt and uncle in Rifle, earning a spot on the honor roll each
quarter and making friends. He started building a life without his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Then in November 1996 Russo called Matt and asked if he would
like to come to Independence, Mo., where Russo lives, for Christmas
vacation. Because Matt wanted to know his father, Payson and
Sharlene agreed Matt could go. At the end of the vacation, Matt and
Russo called Payson and Sharlene in Rifle and said Matt was going
to stay in Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Payson and Sharlene, distraught over the decision, did what they
believed was right for the nephew they love: They let him stay with
the father he'd always wanted, ``hoping Vince had changed and
thinking how it would hurt Matt if we refused,'' Payson said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting stories started several months after Matt began
school at Raytown Middle School, said Sandy Playter, a guidance
counselor at that school whose son, Jay, became one of Matt's
closest friends.
</P>
<P>
   Playter's husband, Mike, was putting together a youth baseball
team and Jay said Matt was an excellent player. Mike Playter
contacted Russo about Matt playing on the team and Russo said Matt
might be going to Colorado. He called again a week later and Russo
said he still didn't know, so Mike Playter suggested Matt could
practice with the team and be in shape if he wanted to play in
Colorado, Sandy Playter explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince and Tami didn't provide any transportation for him to
practices or games, so either my husband or I or my mom picked him
up and took him home, and that's how we got to know him,'' Sandy
Playter said.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri he continued earning straight A's and earlier this
year placed third in a regional math competition. Playter said one
of Matt's English teachers bought new shoes and clothes for Matt to
wear to the math competition.
</P>
<P>
   He also continued excelling in baseball, football and track, but
last year several of his teammates on the track team individually
went to a school guidance counselor to confide that Matt frequently
felt faint at practice, possibly from not eating breakfast or
lunch. When the counselor approached him about it he replied that
he could prepare lunch if he chose, but he just chose not to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was suspicious,'' Sandy Playter said. The other
guidance counselor arranged for Matt to eat school lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Playter said Matt frequently was grounded or confined to the
basement because Vince and Tami Russo said they thought Matt had
lied to them. Because the Russos refuse to comment, nobody knows
what happened inside the home, but Playter said she never caught
Matt in a lie and found him to be a sensitive, kind and intelligent
boy.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Vince Russo became a fundamentalist Christian
and started attending an Independence church that preaches a
literal interpretation of the Bible and strict adherence to it.
While he lived with his father, Matt attended that church and was
active in the youth group, and occasionally carried a Bible to
school.
</P>
<P>
   In January of this year Vince Russo called Payson and Sharlene
Grise and said it wasn't working out for Matt to live in Missouri,
so the Grises called Daniels and asked her to draw up papers for
Vince to relinquish custody of Matt to them. Daniels sent the
papers to Russo to sign, but he never returned them. The Grises
continued asking Russo for the papers and thought it would be good
for Matt to finish the semester in Missouri before actively
pursuing custody.
</P>
<P>
   In June the school year ended and one day none of Matt's friends
knew where he was.
</P>
<P>
   Playter said she called the Russo residence and asked to speak
to Matt and Vince told her Matt didn't live there any more. She
then called Payson and Sharlene Grise to ask if Matt was in Rifle
and they didn't know where he was. Playter called Russo again and
he said Matt was at a ``really neat place'' in Louisiana, so the
Grises asked Daniels to investigate and through contacts Daniels
was able to trace him to the New Bethany compound. Bienville Parish
Sheriff Joe Storey, whose jurisdiction includes Arcadia, was able
to confirm Matt was there.
</P>
<P>
   The Arcadia New Bethany compound is billed as a fundamentalist
Christian facility and a last hope for very troubled youth that
Ford has run for at least 14 years. Because he infrequently talks
to reporters, little is known about Ford or the compound.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 Ford told a United Press International reporter that he
had been a missionary in Australia and came back to the United
States in the early 1970s to open a home for troubled youth and
raise his seven daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's first compound for youth was in Longstreet, La., where he
began taking in the ``extremely troubled'' boys and girls parents
and guardians from across the country sent to him. Louisiana state
officials shut it down in 1981 amid allegations of abuse. In 1982
Ford relocated the compound and school to Walterboro, S.C., again
taking in ``troubled'' kids and some day students. In 1984 three
employees of the facility faced charges of kidnapping and child
neglect but were not convicted. At the time Ford said the charges
were motivated by a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of beatings, neglect and other forms of abuse
continued swirling around the facility. In the 1984 UPI story, Ford
admitted to confining an ``uncontrollable'' child in a small room
and replacing the child's mattress with a chair because Ford said
the child tried to sleep all the time. South Carolina authorities
raided the facility that year and closed it. Ford then opened the
compound near Arcadia.
</P>
<P>
   In several June 1984 New Yrk Times stories, people who formerly
lived at Ford's compound told about being beaten, handcuffed and in
other ways abused by Ford and other compound workers. Ford
adamantly denied the allegations and defended the use of corporeal
punishment for kids he said were so troubled that his compound was
their last chance before jail. He said the corporeal punishment
used there was limited to ``paddlings'' and ``licks'' and no staff
member is allowed to administer more than 10 ``licks'' at a time.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1988, Louisiana state officials raided the New Bethany
compound and took 28 of the 52 girls aged 12 to 17 from the
compound amid renewed rumors of abuse. Ford never was convicted of
a crime and has continued operating the compound, which is not
licensed by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the Louisiana Department of Human Services removed
all of the children in its custody from the New Bethany compound,
according to Paul Brown of the Louisiana Volunteers for Youth
Justice. He said the department deemed it an inappropriate location
for youth in foster care on the heels of Ford's repeated refusals
to allow inspections of the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Storey said Ford also has refused to allow state officials to do
fire inspections and welfare checks and has at various times filed
lawsuits against state agencies waving the banner of separation of
church and state. He has claimed the compound is a church and not
subject to state laws, particularly since the compound is run
entirely by donations, and so far the state has supported his
arguments, said Walter May, Jr., district attorney for the
Louisiana Second Judicial District.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a church facility down there and of course we are
state,'' Storey said. ``He refuses us entry down there, he has
refused us entry even when we've had legal papers.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, much is unknown about the compound. Haynes said
his visit there was brief because he was returning a child to the
compound who had been there previously, then transferred to Hope
Youth Ranch but, at the child's mother's decision, returned to New
Bethany.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real peculiar about outsiders there,'' he said. ``They
basically tried their best to get me out of there as quick as
possible. They're real short with you, and usually when you do an
intake there's quite a bit of paperwork but they didn't require me
to sign any papers. They did ask me what kind of problems we'd had
with the boy, but that's it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me it's not a bad place. They do have the tall fence around
it with razor wire and the German shepherds run free within the
facility and they're constantly barking, which could be
intimidating. But I'd gone down to see the facility and if I'd had
a problem with it I would have brought the boy back with me. The
razor wire may be been a little extreme, but I can see why he has
it. These are troubled kids, kids with problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes said he saw well-maintained grounds amid the scrub pines
of north-central Louisiana, two-story dormitories for boys and
girls, a gym, a church and a small, tidy farm at the back of the
compound. There are separate living facilities for the staff
members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have lived at the compound have said the rules are
extremely strict, which Ford has said is necessary to maintain
discipline for troubled youth. In addition to corporeal punishment
Ford has said he believes is mandated in the Bible, students have
extremely limited access to the outside world. They can have
contact only with the parent or guardian who sent them there.
</P>
<P>
   That is what bothered Joan Grise. She said she couldn't call
Matt and had no way of knowing how he was doing at New Bethany. She
could only send letters to Matt by way of Vince Russo. So she went
to Missouri to see what she could do for her grandson.
</P>
<P>
   She said her attempts to ask Russo what was going on were
fruitless, so she donned a sandwich board bearing Matt's picture
and the words ``Missing!'' and picketed in front of Russo's house.
He called the police and she told them she was too old to be
intimidated. She said she'd beaten cancer into submission for three
years and was tough enough to see this through, too. She wanted to
see her grandson.
</P>
<P>
   She said she is worried, and she's not the only one. The Grises,
the Playters, the Walkers, the Bentleys, all have had no contact
with Matt since July. They don't know if he's happy, if he has
enough to eat, if he still has straight A's or ever gets to play
baseball. And they all want him out of there but they don't know
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Legal counsel in Colorado, Missouri and Louisiana have come up
with different answers. Daniels said Colorado really has no
jurisdiction in this case since it has been almost two years since
Matt has lived here. May said this most likely is a civil rather
than criminal issue because it revolves around custody of Matt and
who can make decisions for him. And since it is a custody issue,
the case would be handled by the state with the most information on
the case - in this case, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys in Louisiana have told the Grises and the Playters
there is little they can do at this point because Vince Russo is
Matt's legal guardian and is allowed by law to make decisions for
Matt and send him to the New Bethany compound.
</P>
<P>
   Storey said Louisiana at this point could do nothing criminally
because there is no documented evidence of abuse at New Bethany. He
said if Matt ran away and sought the sheriff's department's help,
Storey would have to call Russo and see what he wanted done. And if
Russo said he wanted Matt back at New Bethany, Storey would have to
take him there.
</P>
<P>
   So Payson Grise and Sandy Playter and Joan Grise and many of
Matt's other friends said they don't know what to do now, which
makes them feel helpless and fearful of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, they said they fear brainwashing and that they've lost
the boy they love in the most awful sense. They fear what happens
to a boy who loses his mother to lingering, ugly cancer then is
sent away by his father. They fear that the boy they love is scared
and hurting and feeling awfully alone because the people he loves
haven't called or written.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys have told family and friends their best hope is to
begin an expensive custody battle or somehow convince Russo to
bring Matt back. Bentley set up a fund at Norwest Bank to take
donations for legal fees to get custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand how this can happen,'' Walker said. ``How
can this happen in America? And why can't the state of Louisiana do
anything?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a straight A honor student, a wonderful athlete,''
Payson Grise said. ``He's a wonderful kid. He shouldn't be there,
he doesn't need to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of every kid I know, Matt is the one with the most places to
go,'' Bentley said. ``There are so many people who would love to
have him, that I don't know why Vince thought this was the only
option.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grises want him, Bentley said she would love to have him
live with her and David, Playter said despite having four sons of
her own, she and her family would be honored to have Matt live with
them. ``I'm scared he doesn't know that,'' Playter said. ``When
this whole thing started I began keeping a journal of what happened
that day and who called to ask about Matt. It's at least 30 pages
now and I'm keeping it for him to have when he gets out. I want him
to be able to read it and know people prayed for him and fought for
him and thought about him every single day. I want him to know how
much so many people love him.''

VOTE TO TEST QUEBEC'S WILL TO SECEDE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGUEUIL, Quebec _ Chanted slogans flowed, cheers rose,
fleur-de-lis flags flapped everywhere. Although the gathering was
just another campaign rally as Quebec roars toward tomorrow's
election showdown between separatists and federalists, it seemed
more like old home day for the secessionist cause.
</P>
<P>
   Video screens played and replayed images of the triumphs of the
Parti Quebecois, which in the three decades since its founding by
the late Rene Levesque has grown from a fringe movement to Quebec's
most powerful political party.
</P>
<P>
   Levesque's widow was on hand. So was a living legend,
poet-songwriter Gilles Vigneault _ the Woody Guthrie of Quebec
nationalism _ whose daughter, Jessica, gave quavering voice to a
song with the refrain, ``Tomorrow belongs to us.''
</P>
<P>
   And the crowd roared back, ``We want a country!''
</P>
<P>
   At the center of it all was Lucien Bouchard, Quebec's
59-year-old premier. He is a passionate articulator of the
separatist vision, and the bete noire of English Canada, vowing
that the province that already considers itself a nation in spirit
will soon become a nation in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps very soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a people, and a people has the right to be a country,''
he said. ``Give me the mandate so that, finally, we can say `Yes'
to ourselves once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Quebec and Canada face a crucial test tomorrow as Quebecers go
to the polls in the first provincewide elections since the
separatists narrowly lost a referendum on independence in 1995.
Going head-to-head in the race are Bouchard and the Liberal Party
challenger, Jean Charest, 40, the only federalist champion given
any chance of unseating the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   But to the shock of Canadians, who only a few weeks ago were
gleefully predicting a rout of the secessionist government in
Quebec City, Charest has failed to catch fire with voters. The
waning hours of the campaign are looking more like a cakewalk for
the separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec is the only Canadian province with a French majority, 80
percent of 7.3 million people, and surveys have shown that about
two-thirds of French speakers support either outright secession or
some degree of sovereignty from the rest of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Should the separatists win, as the latest polls suggest,
Canada's future as an intact nation will be cast into doubt as
Bouchard presses Quebec toward what he calls its ``natural
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Quebec is notorious for last-minute shifts in the
political wind. If the federalists somehow snatch victory against
all odds, Bouchard will almost certainly resign from politics. With
no other separatist leader in sight capable of matching his
popularity, the dream of Quebec independence would be smashed,
perhaps forever. That is an outcome that the rest of Canada
fervently desires.
</P>
<P>
   Polls showed a dead heat only a few months ago when Charest,
cast as a white knight riding to the rescue of embattled
federalism, yielded to an unprecedented draft movement, quitting a
safe seat in national Parliament to return to his native Quebec to
do battle.
</P>
<P>
   Poll after poll found Charest to be the only politician capable
of beating Bouchard. The timing seemed perfect. For the same polls
also showed Quebecers wearying of the ``neverendum referendum,'' as
Montreal humorist Josh Freed has dubbed the seemingly endless quest
for nationhood.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Charest hammered the theme of Quebec uselessly
dissipating its energies on an impossible scheme. He rhetorically
asked audiences the question that seems to mystify everyone except
Quebecers: Why should this bountiful province seek to quit one of
the world's most prosperous, successful democracies?
</P>
<P>
   ``How long must Quebecers keep pulling this ball and chain?'' he
said last week as the 33-day official campaign season ticked down
toward a ballot box reckoning. ``We must end a political debate
that perpetuates uncertainty, which will be paid for by our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Quebecers, or at least French Quebecers, responded with a
yawn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Charest's charisma and eloquence, the federalist crusade
has fizzled _ in large part because the native son, upon returning
home, strikes many Quebecers as a stranger. Or, worse, just a front
man for English Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the cheering from the rest of Canada when Mr. Charest went
to Quebec did him no good in the province,'' observed Jeffrey
Simpson, national affairs columnist for the Globe and Mail, a
nationally circulated newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bouchard won points simply by mocking Charest's notion
of Quebec comfortably cradled in the arms of Canada: ``Jean Charest
is a man who denies Quebec as it is, in its profound identity. ...
Quebec will never resign itself to being a province like the
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Charest made a dangerous decision by portraying himself as a
political outsider in a province that fears the outside above all
else. The entire history of Quebec might be told as a desperate
struggle for the survival of its unique, French-rooted culture
against English North America.
</P>
<P>
   After years in Ottawa, preoccupied with national politics,
Charest seems to have forgotten that even Quebecers opposed to
secession don't carry much love for Canada in their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Myself, I am not truly a separatist, but I will vote Parti
Quebecois because I trust Mr. Bouchard to look after the interests
of Quebec first and foremost,'' said Marc Trudel, 43, a Quebec City
schoolteacher. ``Mr. Charest seems too comfortable with Canada. We
can never trust the English provinces.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls consistently show that Quebecers are sick of referendums
on independence. And to the rest of Canada, and Charest's
supporters in Quebec, secession is such a soul-searing issue that
it was assumed that weariness with referendums must necessarily
translate into a big vote for the federalists.
</P>
<P>
   But to French Quebecers, separatism is one issue among many.
Even those who think secession is a bad idea will support the Parti
Quebecois if the party seems to serve the greater good of the
province. And the fact is, Bouchard has done a topnotch job of
running Quebec _ unemployment is down, exports to the United States
are up, government spending has been curtailed, and Montreal is
rocketing back as one of the most dynamic cities in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, people feel better economically,'' said
Jean-Marc Leger of the Quebec polling firm Leger &AMP; Leger.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys released last week show that Quebecers believe Bouchard
is honest, dedicated, hard-working, and, perhaps above all, the one
politician capable of forcing Canada to show respect for its most
willful and wayward province.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Charest's federalist campaign was undercut from the
start by comments from Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, who
told a Quebec newspaper, La Presse, that Canada would not seek
changes in federal law to give Quebec special political powers and
protections. A new constitutional formula is widely considered the
only way to keep Quebec from bolting the 131-year-old Canadian
confederation.
</P>
<P>
   Charest is likely to score an impressive victory in Montreal,
with its cosmopolitan population of English Quebecers, Jews, and
ethnic voters _ such as Chinese and East Indians _ who loathe the
French language laws of the separatist government nearly as much as
they despise the secessionist impulse.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Bouchard is sure to win big in the separatist
heartland north of Quebec City.
</P>
<P>
   The real battle for Quebec is being fought in the St. Lawrence
River valley between Montreal and the provincial capital, in faded
centers such as Trois Rivieres, Longueuil, and Cap-de-la-Madeline.
</P>
<P>
   And on this vital front, things look bleak for Charest.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's not about separation but standing tall against
Canada,'' said Valerie Corbeil, a 34-year-old beautician in gritty
Trois-Rivieres. ``Mr. Charest seems a nice man. But I fear he would
let Quebecers become like Cajuns in Louisiana _ colorful characters
with bad French and no power.''
</P>
<P>
   An impressive separatist win would make it a near certainty that
Bouchard will launch another referendum on independence, possibly
as early as next year. He has pledged to put the issue before
Quebecers again only in the event of ``winning conditions,'' by
which he apparently means a Quebec that is economically sound
enough to weather breaking away from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The election is being closely followed not only in Ottawa but
Washington, Paris, London, and other capitals, although many
Americans seem generally oblivious to the political drama unfurling
north of New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans tend to think the absence of bombs and bullets means
no crisis,'' said one Canada-based foreign diplomat. ``But Canada
is drifting toward a very serious situation. The federal government
has basically lost ability to influence events in Quebec.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, in a landmark Canadian Supreme Court case
that backfired badly on the federal government, the nation's nine
high judges ruled that Canada cannot prevent the secession of
Quebec if a ``clear majority'' of Quebecers opt for independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won so many battles,'' Bouchard told a cheering
audience last week. ``We have only one more to win. Let's win it
and give to our children a Quebec that is fully responsible for its
own destiny.''

 &HT;    Southwestern Bell faces battle over `access charge'
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A legislative fight over 12 cents doesn't sound
like much.
</P>
<P>
   But those 12 cents add up to about $800 million a year that
flows from the pockets of local telephone customers to
long-distance companies and, finally, into the bank accounts of
Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-cents-a-minute is the ``access charge'' that the
long-distance companies must pay Southwestern Bell to complete
their in-state long-distance calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that's offering you the 10-cent-a-minute rate is
losing money on the intrastate call,'' said Pat Wood III, chairman
of the Texas Public Utility Commission. ``They're not even
recovering their access (cost), much less their marketing and
billing (costs).''
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance companies say the state should slash the
12-cent rate, saving consumers hundreds of millions of dollars,
because it costs Southwestern Bell less than 1 cent a minute to
complete the calls.
</P>
<P>
   Most of that $800 million is ``a naked shareholder subsidy for
Bell,'' charges Edwin Rutan, AT&AMP;T's vice president for law and
government affairs in the five-state region that includes Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And the long-distance companies fear that, if Southwestern Bell
gets into the long-distance business, it will have a huge
competitive advantage: It will be paying the 12 cents a minute to
itself, enabling it to slice rates in a way its competitors cannot
match.
</P>
<P>
   But David Cole, president of Southwestern Bell-Texas, says the
$800 million from high access charges keeps monthly bills for local
service affordable because the price for local residential service
``is way too low'' compared to costs.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 state law effectively froze the access charge at 12 cents
until Sept. 1, 1999. Under the same law Southwestern Bell agreed to
cap its rates for local phone service until Sept. 1, which allowed
it to escape state regulation of profits.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative theory was that by Sept. 1, 1999, Southwestern
Bell's monopoly on local service _ 77 percent of the state's
telephone lines _ would be cracking and the arrival of competitors
would keep rates down. But while some competition for business
customers is beginning to appear, there's none for residential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   So Wood has said the PUC, as of Sept. 1, could act on the access
charge, which could lead to a broader review of Southwestern Bell's
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Cole put it, ``The commission has threatened us with rate
cases publicly, and they publicly stated that they would go in and
unilaterally adjust our rates.'' Southwestern Bell, already
seething with frustration because the PUC so far has kept it out of
the long-distance business, says Wood is reading the 1995 law all
wrong. The right reading, Bell says, is that, come Sept. 1, it
can't raise its basic local rates without PUC approval, but that
the PUC would have no right to start a rate case. And, it says, the
PUC can't reduce its access charge unless Southwestern Bell itself
comes in for a rate case.
</P>
<P>
   Just to be sure its reading of the law prevails, Southwestern
Bell wants the Legislature, which convenes Jan. 12 for a five-month
session, to extend both the access charge freeze and the rate cap
until Sept. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T and the other long-distance companies oppose those
extensions. They have gotten support indirectly from the Senate
Economic Development Committee, which recently said no new
telephone legislation is needed. And it's always easier to block
legislation than to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the umbrella of the Partnership for a Competitive Texas,
AT&AMP;T, MCI WorldCom and others have conducted a public relations
campaign, including television advertising, for two years that has
attacked the access charge. The ads ran often enough that most
people now know it costs more to call from Midland to Marfa than
from Midland to Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, with 7,500 employees in Texas, won't say how much has been
spent on the ad campaign, but Cole said his research estimated
about $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell, however, is a political powerhouse itself.
The 1995 law, which began opening the state's local telephone
monopolies to competition, was widely regarded as a victory for
Southwestern Bell. Effective at mobilizing its work force for
political support, the company today has 26,000 employees in Texas,
plus 15,000 retirees. Behind the argument over the access charge is
a tough question: How much are local rates subsidized by
long-distance access charges?
</P>
<P>
   And if local rates move closer to actual costs, as they are
expected to do as competition develops, will that leave some people
unable to afford an ordinary monthly phone bill for local service?
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell says the access charge subsidizes local rates.
If local service was priced at its true cost, Cole said, the
monthly rate would be about $20 instead of the $9.35 charged in the
Austin area. (The $9.35 does not include various other fees and
taxes added to the bill.)
</P>
<P>
   But Southwestern Bell's critics have hotly disputed for years
whether local service is subsidized and, if so, how much.
</P>
<P>
   Rutan, of AT&AMP;T, said Southwestern Bell needs only about 3 cents
a minute from access charges to keep monthly rates low. Throw in 1
cent for actual costs, he said, and the access charge would be
about 4 cents. That would bring Southwestern Bell about $266
million a year, not $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the PUC will consider slicing the access charge by
about 3 cents per minute in connection with creation of a new fee
for the Universal Service Fund, which would subsidize rates for
particuarly low-income customers, services for the hearing-impaired
and customers in high-cost rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   However, that 3-cent cut would not reduce Southwestern Bell's
total revenues because it would be offset by revenue from the new
fund.
</P>
<P>
   The new fee would be imposed on all telephone companies: local,
long-distance and wireless. The fee, which the companies could pass
on to their customers, is expected to be about 5 percent of a
monthly bill. Customers might not notice much difference in their
total telephone bills _ if the long-distance companies pass on the
savings from a 3-cent cut, which they are not legally obligated to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell's critics say the company could well afford a
much larger cut than 3 cents in its access charge with no impact on
local rates.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC staff completed a recent study that showed that, by
traditional regulatory measures, Southwestern Bell had last year
earned $288 million more than it would have been allowed if its
profits were still regulated.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Southwestern Bell is making so much money _
``overearning,'' in regulatory parlance _ that it likely would face
rate cuts by the commission but for the 1995 law.
</P>
<P>
   But Cole, who said his company is ``not overearning to any
extent,'' sounded agitated at the very idea of discussing
Southwestern Bell's profits. The 1995 law ended profit regulation,
he said, and the commission's estimates are ``fraught with
assumptions from 15 years ago that aren't even relevant today.''
</P>
<P>
   If access charges were cut and local rates go up to make even
only part of it, there's another conundrum: The increase in the
local bill could be offset by the savings in the long-distance bill
_ if the customer makes a lot of long-distance calls. But those who
don't make long-distance calls could get hit hardest by a higher
local rate, including those who least likely could afford the
increase, because there would be no offsetting savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main interest is that access is priced too high,'' Wood
said. ``It should come down, but we want to make sure that it comes
down in a way that all customers get to see the benefit. It may not
be perfect, but everybody ought to see something.''
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell also points out that, even if the access
charge were cut, the long-distance companies would be under no
legal obligation to pass on any savings to customers.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which has no power over long-distance rates,
recently asked for ironclad guarantees from the big three _ AT&AMP;T,
which still has more than half of the Texas long-distance market,
MCI WorldCom and Sprint _ that they would pass on savings to
customers in a way that all would benefit, not just heavy
long-distance users. AT&AMP;T and Sprint were willing, but MCI WorldCom
wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position has been that we will flow-through all of the
access reductions _ we said that several times,'' said Neal Larsen,
MCI WorldCom's regional director of public policy. ``But don't
dictate how that's to be done; let the competitive market take care
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood and Commissioner Judy Walsh, however, indicated at a recent
PUC meeting that they were reluctant to approve the new fee for the
Universal Service Fund if there was no assurance that all customers
would benefit from cutting the access charge. That would mean no
3-cent cut in the access charge. Perhaps, Wood said, the commission
should delay action to see if the Legislature would give it
authority to require that savings from cuts in the cut be passed on
to consumers.

 &HT;    AT&AMP;T blunders overshadow fight over charges
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ AT&AMP;T will soon need every friend it can find in
the Texas Legislature for a backroom brawl with Southwestern Bell
Telephone Co. But in recent months the long-distance giant has shot
itself in the foot _ with a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will be over the access charge AT&AMP;T and other
long-distance companies must pay Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.
each year to complete their in-state toll calls _ about $800
million. Southwestern Bell wants the Legislature to extend a freeze
on the access charge for another two years, while the long-distance
companies want it to expire as scheduled Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, however, AT&AMP;T has gotten more attention for
its blunders than complaints about access charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it is that they're trying too hard or if
they're not coordinated,'' said state Rep. Steve Wolens, D-Dallas.
``But it seems to be a rash of mishaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Those mishaps include:
</P>
<P>
   -With little public notice raising by 50 percent the cost of
in-state long-distance calls under its widely advertised One Rate
Plus plan. When consumers complained, AT&AMP;T service representatives
blamed the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which had nothing to
do with it. AT&AMP;T suspended the increase for several months while it
did a better job of notifying customers _ and educating employees.
</P>
<P>
   -Charging the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston $100,000 or more for calls made by residential customers. A
state-hired consultant said the misbillings are much higher,
perhaps as much as $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   -Getting fined $300,000 by the state for slamming, the practice
of switching a customer's long-distance provider without consent.
</P>
<P>
   -An AT&AMP;T lobbyist, Vaughn Aldredge, being fingered in September
by Wolens as the true author of language used by a legislative
committee in a report that favored the phone industry over cities
in a dispute about franchise fees. (Aldredge later said the
language was a group effort by the industry, not his alone.)
</P>
<P>
   The controversy embarrassed the interim joint committee
momentarily, but its chairman, Sen. Eddie Lucio, D-Brownsville,
decided not to change the report. Still, it's Wolens who chairs the
House State Affairs Committee, which customarily handles all
telephone legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just keep stepping in it,'' complained Charles Land,
executive director of the Texas Association of Long Distance
Telephone Companies, whose 35 members are smaller long-distance
companies generally allied with AT&AMP;T. (AT&AMP;T is not a member.)
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Rutan, AT&AMP;T's vice president for law and government
affairs for a five-state region that includes Texas, said that in
each case where AT&AMP;T goofed, the company acknowledged error and
fixed it. For example, he said, to avoid slamming AT&AMP;T no longer
uses third-party contractors to solicit new long-distance
customers.
</P>
<P>
   And, Rutan said, he's confident that AT&AMP;T can hold its own in
the upcoming legislative session: ``As a company right now we are
on a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agree that AT&AMP;T's self-inflicted wounds were not fatal.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, AT&AMP;T is a giant in its own right. The company had
about $51 billion in worldwide revenues last year. Rutan won't say
how much of the Texas long-distance market AT&AMP;T serves, but he
doesn't dispute one estimate of 63 percent of the residential
market. And he said AT&AMP;T has about half of the business market.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're an 800-pound gorilla with a whole bunch of zeroes
on your balance sheet,'' said Land, ``you're always going to be a
force to reckoned with, and you're always going to have
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said he values AT&AMP;T as a counter-balance to Southwestern
Bell, whose parent company, SBC Communications Inc. in San Antonio,
had $24.8 billion in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   And Wolens added: ``This is not a slam-dunk for SBC simply
because AT&AMP;T is tripping all over their feet . . . This issue is
much bigger than AT&AMP;T.''

SINN FEIN'S ADAMS WARNS OF SNAG ON ARMS ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The Sinn Fein leader, Gerry Adams, warned that the
political settlement in Northern Ireland could collapse unless the
British and Irish governments stop focusing on the fate of
paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview with the Globe, Adams expressed both
concern and optimism. He said the stalled peace process was in
danger of becoming hopelessly bogged down over one issue _ weapons.
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged that he and other leading members of his
party, which is the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
have been trying to persuade skeptical members of the IRA to stay
committed to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem at the moment is that the agreement is losing
credibility. So that means we have to convince people, Sinn Fein
and I have to convince people, that the agreement isn't the
unionists having their way again,'' Adams said Friday over
breakfast in a Dublin hotel.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process is stalled over the refusal of Protestant
unionists to allow Adams and the Sinn Fein negotiator, Martin
McGuinness, to sit in the Cabinet of the new government, which was
created under the Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the Northern Ireland Assembly's first minister,
and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, says Sinn Fein cannot
take part in the government until the IRA begins turning in some of
its vast arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   But Adams says there is nothing in the agreement that links Sinn
Fein's participation in government with IRA disarmament. Under the
agreement, Irish republican and British loyalist paramilitary
groups are supposed to begin turning in their weapons within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, who with nationalist leader John Hume was awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize last month, is fighting a rear-guard action in
his party by those who are bitterly opposed to the agreement.
Unionists are especially opposed to the parts that call for the
release of paramilitary prisoners and reform of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, which is 93 percent Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he appreciates Trimble's political difficulties,
``but that doesn't mean he can rewrite the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said it was up to British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, to make it clear that arms
decommissioning is only part of the settlement, and that the issue
should not be allowed to marginalize Sinn Fein and a party linked
to loyalist paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to the governments,'' Adams said. ``While I'm worried,
I also share Tony Blair's optimism in that we all have come too far
to let it go back. The governments need to step up their ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Unionists say the IRA must give up its weapons to prove it is
seriously committed to the democratic process. But the IRA says
previous incarnations of Irish revolutionary groups were allowed to
enter the democratic process without giving up their weapons.
Loyalist groups, meanwhile, have said they won't turn in their
weapons even if the IRA does.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the seriousness of the impasse, Blair traveled to
Belfast last week to seek a compromise on the arms issue. Ahern is
scheduled to do the same this week. Both leaders, who held talks in
Dublin on Wednesday and Thursday, said they hoped to announce soon
the establishment of cross-border authorities that would oversee
areas of mutual interest on the island of Ireland. That part of the
agreement is seen as crucial by Irish nationalists because it
involves the Irish government in the administration of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Blair became the first British prime minister to
address the Irish parliament in Dublin. Adams was in the
distinguished visitors' area as he watched Blair's address, further
evidence of the gradual emergence into the mainstream of a man who
in the 1970s was an IRA commander.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Thursday, Adams spoke to a group of 400 business
leaders here, outlining his party's economic policy. Adams was
applauded by the industrialists, another milestone in Sinn Fein's
transition from pariah to ordinary political party.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he was not trying to be alarmist, or use hyperbole,
but he said he was worried that too many people were becoming
complacent about the peace process. He said it could collapse if
the impasse is allowed to drag on indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is serious,'' he said.

RETURNERS ARE RUNNING UP THE SCORES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This has been a wild season for special teams coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Through the season's first 12 weeks, 10 kickoff returns and 13
punt returns have gone for touchdowns, a total of 23 that is
unprecedented for 12 weeks since the advent of the 16-game schedule
in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The punt-return total of 13 matches the 12-week total in 1994
and 1997, the two years with the most combined punt and kick
returns for scores in NFL history. In 1994, 32 kicks were returned
for scores, and last year 29 were brought back. The record is in
jeopardy, and Dante Scarnecchia, the Patriots' special teams coach,
is not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of returners is as high as it's ever been,'' said
Scarnecchia. ``Every week, it's `Oh, my God.' There are a lot more
return guys who can pull the trigger now than there used to be in
the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarnecchia does not support the theory that the advent of free
agency and hence the constant movement of players who in the past
might have formed the core of a consistent special teams unit is
part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have mixed emotions about that,'' Scarnecchia said. ``It's
nice when you've got the same guys year in and year out like we
used to have, but they all hit the wall. They become starters and
don't want to do it anymore or they're close to becoming a starter
and so focused on that they've forgotten about playing special
teams. And, frankly, you can do that job for only so long before
you can't make yourself do it anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I like new faces. It's painful sometimes until you
get them coached and you find yourself emphasizing the same stuff
every year, over and over, but that's coaching. What it gives you
is enthusiasm. I like that.''

   When  &UR; Doug Flutie  &LR; arrives at Foxboro Stadium Sunday, he will
bring with him the second-highest third-down conversion rate of any
NFL quarterback this season; he is second only to Minnesota's
 &UR; Randall Cunningham &LR; . The importance of this is obvious by the fact
that thequarterbacks with the five highest third-down percentages
are a collective 29-11 as starters. Flutie is 37 of 72 (51.4
percent, 5-1 as a starter). The others in the top five are  &UR; Steve
Young  &LR; (47.3 percent, 7-3),  &UR; Vinny Testaverde  &LR; (46.9 percent, 7-1),
and  &UR; Steve Beuerlein  &LR; (46.6 percent, 2-5) ... Cunningham told an
interesting story last week about how his comeback began on a golf
course in Santa Barbara, Calif., during the year he exiled himself
from the NFL. Cunningham was playing in a foursome with  &UR; Michael
Jordan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and at one point Jordan pulled out a cigar. Someone asked
what it was, and Jordan said, ``It's a championship cigar.
Cunningham wouldn't know anything about this.'' Although Cunningham
laughed at the time, he also said it ``opened my eyes.'' Soon he
accepted the backup role to  &UR; Brad Johnson  &LR; in Minnesota and now,
with Johnson out until at least Dec. 6 with a broken thumb, he's
the comeback player of the year ... Just for the record, the Bills
and Jets have the easiest finishing schedules in the AFC East. Both
face opponents with an aggregate winning percentage of .491. The
Patriots' opponents are .582, while Miami's are .709 ... Dolphins
rookie  &UR; John Avery  &LR; comes from a tough household. Twice last Monday
night, he missed adding to those kick-return totals when he was
tackled or tripped by New England kicker  &UR; Adam Vinatieri &LR; . It was
no surprise to learn that Avery's teammates were on him about that,
but apparently he had a harsher critic. Avery claimed his mother
called and said, ``How do you let a kicker take you down from
behind? I thought I raised you better than that.'' Such
close-to-home criticism is nothing new to him, however. ``When I
ran a 4.3 at the combine,'' said Avery, ``My father told me, `I can
do that.''' ... Dolphins wide receiver  &UR; O.J. McDuffie  &LR; has been on
a tear. In his last three games, he nearly doubled his season
receiving yardage, catching 24 passes for 314 yards. In the first
half of the season, McDuffie had 32 catches for 345 yards.

   When the undefeated Broncos wend their way into Qualcomm Stadium
Sunday to face the 5-6 San Diego Chargers, an oddity of history has
a chance to repeat itself. On Nov. 18, 1984, the 11-0 Dolphins went
to San Diego to play the 5-6 Chargers. By the end of the day, San
Diego had ended that Dolphin team's quest to match its undefeated
1972 brethren, beating Miami, 34-28, in overtime. Among the
Chargers players that season was former Patriot safety  &UR; Tim
Fox &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who said that week, ``The way our season is going, we'll
probably win.'' If history repeats itself Sunday, no one will be
happier than  &UR; Dick Anderson  &LR; and  &UR; Nick Buoniconti &LR; , &UR;  &LR; two mainstays
of the 1972 Miami team that went 17-0. They and several other
members of that team gather each season after the last remaining
undefeated team is beaten to toast themselves with champagne. That
recently prompted another former teammate,  &UR; Manny Fernandez &LR; , &UR;  &LR; to
comment: ``I wish them and their psychoanalysts well.'' ... Denver,
by the way, has won its last seven road games, dating back to last
year's playoffs ... Here's how quickly things can change in the
NFL. Not a single one of the teams that won a division title last
season is leading a division this week ... These could be flush
times for  &UR; Fred Taylor &LR; . The Jaguars rookie running back has rushed
for 806 yards and 10 touchdowns and is within hailing distance of
several big-money incentive clauses in his contract. Taylor will
earn an extra $150,000 if he rushes for 1,000 yards and $200,000
more if he scores 12 touchdowns. If Taylor reaches 1,200 yards,
it's worth $200,000, and for 1,300 yards he would be paid an
additional $500,000 ... Taylor, by the way, has one more touchdown
than Minnesota rookie receiver  &UR; Randy Moss  &LR; and four more than
Patriot rookie running back  &UR; Robert Edwards  &LR; ... There are many
reasons why the Packers have struggled this year, but a glaring one
has been the absence of the big plays that characterized their
recent seasons. This time a year ago, Green Bay's offense had
produced 50 plays of 20 yards or more. This year, the number is 30.
Worse, their running backs had 12 such plays in 1997. They have
none this season.

   Jets coach  &UR; Bill Parcells  &LR; came up with a most innovative
explanation for why he kept the locker room closed to the media _
in violation of league rules _ after last Sunday's victory over the
Oilers. He said it was for ``safety reasons'' because the visitors'
locker room at Vanderbilt Stadium was so small. Parcells didn't
specify, but it seems fair to assume he was talking about his
players' safety, and not the media's. Either way, it cost the Jets
$10,000 ...  &UR; Rick Terry &LR; , &UR;  &LR; a defensive tackle whom Parcells drafted
in the second round last year and cut this year, was asked by the
Carolina media for a one-word assessment of Parcells. ``Dictator,''
said Terry, who is now a backup with the Panthers ... When
Arizona's  &UR; Jake Plummer  &LR; rushed for three touchdowns last Sunday,
he became the first quarterback to do so since  &UR; Archie Manning  &LR; in
1977. Plummer has been impressive enough in his second season to
lead Dallas cornerback  &UR; Deion Sanders  &LR; to comment, ``He's the kind
of quarterback you don't want to see in the fourth quarter.'' ...
Quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf  &LR; continues to sit on the bench in San Diego,
and his bar tabs continue to sit on the wall of The Coug, a popular
watering hole in Pullman, Wash., near the Washington State campus.
Apparently Leaf is a legendary cheapskate, which is why they have
his bills _ with tip _ posted. One of the best of the worst is a
$90 bill with a $5 tip ... When head coaching vacancies open up
this winter, don't expect to see many senior citizens filling them.
 &UR; Bryan Cox  &LR; may not be right about everything he said last week,
but it's hard to argue with his position on the success rate of
resurrected head coaches in the NFL. Four current coaches are over
60 _  &UR; Dick Vermeil &LR; , &UR; Jim Mora &LR; , &UR; Bobby Ross &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Ted Marchibroda &LR; 
_ and their combined record is 14-31. Vermeil has said he would
never resign, despite a two-year record in St. Louis of 8-19, and
Marchibroda is 14-28-1 since taking over the Ravens _ the
second-worst record in the league during that period. Who was
worse? Indianapolis (14-29), the team that fired Marchibroda ...
Speaking of the Colts, they're 29th in the NFL in yards allowed
(367.5), rushing yards allowed (159.4), and points allowed (27.1)
per game, and with good reason. Of their 25 defensive players, only
five were drafted in the first three rounds, and, because of
injuries, as many as five of Sunday's starters could be undrafted
free agents.

   The Falcons are taking few chances with 1,000-yard rusher  &UR; Jamal
Anderson &LR; . Last week they asked his agent to submit a proposal for
a contract extension that would make Anderson one of the league's
top five paid backs. Anderson, who has a year to run on his present
deal, has rushed for 1,000 yards three straight seasons and will
earn $1.2 million this year and is due to be paid $1.6 million in
1999. No deal is imminent, but the Falcons seem committed to
re-signing him long before he gets into the position  &UR; Curtis Martin
 &LR; was in last March with New England ... Troubled ex-Bears defensive
end  &UR; Alonzo Spellman  &LR; has resurfaced around Chicago and is talking
about wanting to return to the NFL next season. Spellman recently
did a round of TV and print interviews while appearing at a
children's center he helped finance. Although he has been diagnosed
as manic-depressive, he said he would refuse to take his prescribed
medicine, even if it was a requirement for returning to the NFL.
``If it comes down to that _ and I don't think it's going to come
down to that _ it's definitely something I will not do,'' Spellman
said. ``I know everything's all right with 'Zo.'' ... Patriots
coach  &UR; Pete Carroll  &LR; said he had never heard of a call as bizarre
as the botched coin flip in the Pittsburgh-Detroit game Thursday in
which Steelers running back  &UR; Jerome Bettis  &LR; was heard calling
``tails'' yet referee  &UR; Phil Luckett  &LR; insisted he'd called heads and
thus allowed the Lions to receive the kickoff. Detroit marched
downfield to kick the winning field goal. Luckett later claimed
Bettis first called heads and then changed it to tails, even though
replays indicated Bettis called ``tails.'' ``I've never heard of
that happening,'' Carroll said. ``I don't know how that could have
happened. Heads-tails? I've never heard of that happening. That's
pretty unusual.'' Let's hope so ... Former Carolina quarterback
 &UR; Kerry Collins  &LR; believes he has a kindred spirit in his new boss,
Saints coach  &UR; Mike Ditka &LR; . ``He talked to me about second chances
and the fact that he got a second chance and that it saved his
career,'' Collins said. Ditka didn't disagree, citing how he went
from being a Pro Bowl tight end in Chicago to a disgruntled player
when he was traded to the Eagles. ``I became a very bad guy,''
Ditka said. ``I was a complainer. I was all the things you don't
want to be. I spent a lot of time in bars and told my story to any
poor sap that would listen.'' Now Ditka is counseling Collins, and
it may be paying off. Last Sunday Collins not only threw for 328
yards in a 31-20 loss to San Francisco but also pulled a child from
a car involved in a smoky accident on his way to the airport. The
Saints are hoping to sign Collins to a new deal at the end of the
season but realize that if he plays well, they could lose him to
cap-friendly Cleveland. ``We'd love to sign him, but we won't
overpay for him, either,'' Saints GM  &UR; Bill Kuharich  &LR; said.
``Cleveland is in a position to do that because they have all that
cap room, but we're hopeful if he plays well the rest of the season
we'll have a chance to re-sign him.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Owner  &UR; Al Lerner &LR;  decided that his new Cleveland team would wear
the same logo-less helmets as the old Browns, even though NFL
Properties came up with several dramatic possibilities. After
seeing them, Lerner said, ``Good. If they want to use them, let
them buy a team.'' Lerner said the helmets will remain plain ``for
at least as long as my life expectancy.'' ... San Francisco
executive  &UR; Dwight Clark  &LR; is expected to be released from bondage by
the 49ers this week and could be in his new office in Cleveland
next door to  &UR; Carmen Policy  &LR; before next weekend ... Good wishes
and a prayer go out to Saints salary cap consultant  &UR; Terry
O'Neill &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former network executive, who is recovering from
cancer surgery at home in Greenwich, Conn. The play of his Saints
this season should help cheer him, since he helped figure out how
to re-sign  &UR; Joe Johnson  &LR; and  &UR; Mark Fields  &LR; ... Speaking of the
Saints, since they signed Fields to a multimillion-dollar extension
a month ago, he has gone wild. Fields has made 11, 10, and 11
tackles in his last three games and has a sack in each one ... Poor
 &UR; Priest Holmes. &LR;  If he could play the Cincinnati Bengals every
week, he'd be the high priest of NFL running backs. The Ravens
runner rushed for 227 yards vs. the Bengals last Sunday and has 400
in their two meetings this year, averaging 6.3 yards a carry.
Holmes has the Ravens' only three rushing touchdowns and all came
against Cincinnati. If Holmes could keep up the same pace against
the rest of the league, he'd rush for 3,200 yards ... Here is the
difference Parcells has made in the Jets. In the last 27 games, the
Jets are 16-11 under Parcells. In the 27 games prior to that under
 &UR; Rich Kotite &LR; , &UR;  &LR; they were 3-24. For those of you following at home,
that's a 13-game swing.

ZOLAK MAY HAVE CAREER OPPORTUNITY ON HANDS

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ He has been careful not to talk about it through
his long, six-day wait, but Scott Zolak knows what could be at
stake for him this afternoon at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   If Zolak is pressed into action for Drew Bledsoe, as appears
likely, this could be his chance of a lifetime. After nearly eight
years of patient waiting, Zolak's moment may be arriving at the
best of times for him and in the worst of times for his team.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots cannot afford a slipup Sunday against the Buffalo
Bills if they want to keep their playoff hopes off life support.
There is no margin for error, which is why the notion of playing
Bledsoe with a broken right index finger is courting disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The game is likely to be a close one, as was the first battle
between these teams two weeks ago. It very well could be decided by
a key play or perhaps a turnover. And what more likely way to tempt
fate than to ask your quarterback to take 60 or 70 snaps from
center with a broken finger on his throwing hand? Or to ask him to
throw 30 or 40 passes with it?
</P>
<P>
   That is why it makes sense to play Zolak despite the fact he has
not started a game since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there are financial incentives for Zolak to do well.
</P>
<P>
   Next February, he becomes a free agent. As things were going, he
was due to enter the market as a backup quarterback who had not
started a game in more than three years and had thrown fewer than
25 passes in that time. In other words, he wouldn't have much to
sell but eight years as a loyal soldier.
</P>
<P>
   But if Zolak comes through Sunday, or in one or two other games
this season, the perception of him could change radically in a
league starving for quarterback talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking about that right now, because at the time
you're thinking about things like that, you can float off and get
out of control,'' Zolak said. ``But I understand what this is. I
understand this game could do a lot for me. I also understand I
could end up not even playing.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does play and performs well, however, one can only
speculate about what it could do to his market value.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Rob Johnson was in a similar situation last year,
after having sat for three seasons behind Mark Brunell in
Jacksonville. He replaced an injured Brunell in the team's 1997
opener against Baltimore and completed 20 of 24 passes for 294
yards while throwing for two touchdowns and running for a third.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson never started another game, but the NFL did not forget
him. During the offseason, there was a scramble to pry Johnson away
from Jacksonville, a team for whom he was not going to play as long
as Brunell stayed healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills were so enraptured by his one start and several relief
performances that they traded their first- and fourth-round draft
choices for him and then signed him to a lucrative contract that
included an $8 million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson will be watching from the bench, having lost his job to
Doug Flutie only months after he was awarded it, while Zolak will
likely be getting his chance to hit an NFL jackpot with an
outstanding performance.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak's agent, Ralph Cindrich, was reluctant to talk about all
that, in part because he is not sure his client will even play and
in part because no one knows how ready Zolak is to take advantage
of what could be a very advantageous position.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cindrich understands the negotiation game as well as
anyone. He knows what this opportunity could mean in the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not where Scott's focus is,'' Cindrich said. ``He's not
thinking about things individually. He has a lot of respect for
Drew and a lot of confidence in his own ability. He's just excited
at the prospect of possibly getting to play. Because Drew has been
such a durable guy, he hasn't had that chance very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the rest of it, I don't know that one or two good games
would do it for Scott, although certainly it makes sense that if he
gets this opportunity it could be important to him.''
</P>
<P>
   As important to his long-term future as it is to his team's
short-term fate.

PRICE OF SUGAR MAY GO UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; There is only one Sugar Ray, and the same may be true of Sugar
Shane.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the great skill Sugar Ray Leonard showed throughout
his distinguished career, when you say ``Sugar Ray'' in boxing
circles what follows next is ``Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   If things continue along for another five or six years the way
they've been going lately, if anyone says ``Sugar Shane'' in
another decade or two, the only thing you'll hear after that is
``Mosley.''
</P>
<P>
   It is always dangerous in boxing to put Sugar in your system,
because most fighters wilt in comparison to the greatest boxer in
history, but Mosley has made a strong case for his right to borrow
the name since first winning the lightweight title.
</P>
<P>
   His most recent victory was a surprisingly one-sided destruction
of former World Boxing Council super featherweight champion James
Leija, and with it the International Boxing Federation champion did
more than keep himself undefeated. He also arguably moved one step
closer to a father's seemingly odd goal for his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Shane Mosley to become the cash cow of his division,
the way Roy Jones is in his division and Oscar De La Hoya is in his
division,'' Jack Mosley said. ``He is the best lightweight in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the thought of your son becoming a cash cow might make
some parents cringe, if you work in the often bizarre world of
big-time boxing, such a goal is not as demeaning as it might sound,
because prizefighting is as much about the prize as the fighting,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley got the first of those prizes a day after beating Leija
silly when he signed a seven-fight deal with HBO that includes the
possibility of at least one pay-per-view match. Such a contract is
the Holy Grail of the sport, for that is where the money is, and
where the money is is where Jack Mosley wants his son to be, and
his right to be there will never be disputed by James Leija.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets more respect from me every time I watch him,'' Leija
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is what Mosley and his father are seeking now. The respect
not only of boxing's cognoscenti, who have long known him as the
fastest and most gifted fighter in the lower weight classes, but
also the respect of the general sporting public, because from there
comes the real cash.
</P>
<P>
   To earn the kind of money De La Hoya, Jones, and Prince Naseem
Hamed command, Mosley must stay busy even though he seems unrivaled
in his weight class, but he must do something more. He must do
something far more difficult than fighting.
</P>
<P>
   He must blow his own horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cesar Bazan said in some Spanish newspapers he wanted to unify
the (lightweight) title,'' Mosley said after some prodding from his
father. ``I've always wanted to do the same. We're going to get
that straightened out in his mind so we'll all know who's the best
lightweight in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley didn't seem to indicate that he thought that lightweight
was the current WBC champion, but he also didn't seem comfortable
doing what he has steadfastly refused to do most of his life _
boast.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mosley understands if such a fight can be made (and it might
be, because promoter Bob Arum has a piece of Bazan and a
relationship with HBO, which wants the fight) he could solidify his
dominance at 135 pounds by beating Bazan and then giving a shot to
Stevie Johnston (another Arum fighter the public was just beginning
to recognize when Bazan upset him). If he wins those fights on HBO,
Mosley's name would be more widely known and he could move up to
140 pounds and immediately challenge for a title with the full
knowledge that he was out of legitimate lightweights with which to
make a payday.
</P>
<P>
   He would then be free to hunt down the likes of hard-hitting
Kostya Tszyu, relentless Vince Phillips, two-time world champion
Miguel Angel Gonzalez, and perhaps even a young lion named Zab
Judah, who is 17-0 and has looked good building that record in the
140-pound class.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever direction Mosley takes, his father believes there is
only one route to follow. The loud one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane is trying to become cocky but he's always been a quiet,
laidback guy,'' his father-trainer-manager said. ``He's trying to
be more assertive outside the ring to let everybody know who he is
because he can back up what he says.''
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jones said recently, ``I love the father-son relationship they
have,'' when asked about the Mosleys because his own attempts at
that failed so miserably that he and his hard-bitten father now
barely speak after years of training together. Jones said Mosley's
father came to him to discuss the problems of a
personal-professional relationship between father and son and Jones
advised him to give his son room to be a man. ``He realized he was
losing Shane, and he changed,'' Jones said ... Just for the record,
here's your faithful commentator's latest pound-for-pound Top 10
list: (1) Jones; (2) Mosley; (3) De La Hoya; (4)  &UR; Mark
Johnson &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (5)  &UR; Felix Trinidad &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (6)  &UR; Evander Holyfield &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (7)
 &UR; Tim Austin &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (8) Naseem Hamed; (9)  &UR; Ike Quartey &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (10)  &UR; Johnny
Tapia  &LR; and  &UR; Saman Sorjnturong  &LR; (tie). Any quarrels, please send
them along ... Just for the record, here's old friend and top
trainer  &UR; Teddy Atlas's  &LR; all-time best pound-for-pound ratings: (1)
Robinson; (2)  &UR; Henry Armstrong &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (3)  &UR; Muhammad Ali &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (4)  &UR; Benny
Leonard &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (5)  &UR; Sam Langford &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (6)  &UR; Harry Greb &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (7)  &UR; Mickey
Walker &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (8)  &UR; Roberto Duran &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (9)  &UR; Gene Tunney &LR; ; &UR;  &LR; (10)  &UR; Carlos
Monzon  &LR; and  &UR; Joe Louis &LR; . What makes his list most interesting is
that Atlas included three heavyweights. Often, they are ignored by
less knowledgeable observers. Any quarrels, please send them to him
... HBO had hoped to find a way to replace the injured Gonzalez
with Mosley last night but he was unable to make such a quick
turnaround two weeks after his last title defense. So HBO settled
for putting in Cuban  &UR; Diosbelys Hurtado  &LR; with original Gonzalez
opponent Tszyu because WBC president  &UR; Jose Sulaiman  &LR; agreed to
sanction it for one of those dreaded ``interim'' titles that so
often come back to haunt everyone. The winner of the interim WBC
junior welterweight title had to agree to fight _ or sign to fight
_ Gonzalez within 90 days. It was Hurtado's second fight in 15
days, as he went the distance Nov. 13 vs.  &UR; Manuel Gomez  &LR; in Miami
on a card that included fellow Cuban exile  &UR; Eliseo Castillo &LR; . Those
bouts were broadcast on Radio Marti back to Cuba, marking only the
third time a sporting event was broadcast from the US to Cuba since
 &UR; Fidel Castro's  &LR; takeover. The others were the 1997 and 1998 World
Series pitching performances of  &UR; Livan Hernandez  &LR; and his brother
 &UR; Orlando Hernandez  &LR; ...  &UR; Dino Duva's  &LR; promotional company, Main
Events, tied the can last week to four fighters, including
undefeated but reluctant heavyweight prospect  &UR; Chris Byrd  &LR; (26-0)
and two Cuban defectors who were originally signed with great
fanfare at the Atlanta Olympics after a heated battle for their
services with rival promoter  &UR; Bob Arum &LR; . Duva dumped both junior
lightweight  &UR; Joel Casamayor  &LR; and cruiserweight  &UR; Ramon Garbey  &LR; ...
Now that the deal has been done between promoter  &UR; Don King  &LR; and
TVKO, HBO's pay-per-view arm, for the March 13 unification fight
between Holyfield, the World Boxing Association-IBF heavyweight
champion, and WBC titleholder  &UR; Lennox Lewis &LR; , &UR;  &LR; King will take the
two champions on a publicity tour, which hits Boston Tuesday ...
Next Saturday night, King will make his first promotional
appearance in New Jersey since Dec. 8, 1990, when he stages the
first title defense of new WBA welterweight champion  &UR; James Page
 &LR; against mandatory challenger  &UR; Jose Luis Lopez &LR; , &UR;  &LR; as well as World
Boxing Organization junior bantamweight champion Tapia's quest for
the bantamweight title vs. WBA champion  &UR; Nana Konadu  &LR; at the
Atlantic City Convention Center. King had been banned from
promoting in New Jersey when he was indicted by the US government
on insurance fraud charges, but he has twice beaten the charges ...
The problem in announcing the  &UR; Mike Tyson &LR; - &UR; Frans Botha  &LR; fight has
been solved. The MGM Grand will host the event as planned Jan. 16,
but it had been seeking a multi-fight option while offering no site
fee. That meant the casino would provide no guaranteed money to the
promoters but simply supply the building, with the promoter keeping
the gate and taking all the financial risk. Those demands were
altered this past week, and an announcement on an agreement will be
made in Los Angeles this week.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 8 at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, promoter  &UR; Cedric
Kushner  &LR; will stage another of his Heavyweight Explosion shows on
US Satellite Broadcasting, with  &UR; Kirk Johnson  &LR; (26-0, 19 KOs) in
the main event vs. former IBF cruiserweight champion  &UR; Al  &LR; ``Ice''
 &UR; Cole  &LR; (30-3, 15 KOs). Byrd faces  &UR; Jeff Wooden &LR; , &UR; Obed Sullivan
 &LR; fights aged  &UR; Jesse Ferguson &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and former NFL running back  &UR; Alonzo
Highsmith  &LR; continues his quest for boxing glory on the same card
... Jones took a solid shot at King during a recent press
conference called to publicize what turned out to be another
one-sided victory for him over WBO middleweight champion  &UR; Otis
Grant. &LR;  While talking about the benefit screening of an HBO
documentary on Robinson held to raise money for the children of
crippled former middleweight champ  &UR; Gerald McClellan &LR; , &UR;  &LR; Jones said,
``It was interesting to see HBO take a Showtime fighter (McClellan)
and run a benefit for him. (Promoters)  &UR; Murad  &LR; ( &UR; Muhammad &LR; ), Cedric
Kushner, Bob Arum, and Dino Duva were all there, but the guy who
did promote him (King), I didn't see. I'm sure I wouldn't miss that
hair if it had been there.'' In fairness, King did buy a table at
the event but declined to attend after a daylong negotiating
session with Duva over the Holyfield-Lewis contract ... The best
woman fighter in the world,  &UR; Lucia Ryker &LR; , &UR;  &LR; approached fading
former champion  &UR; Terry Norris  &LR; in a West Coast gym not long after
his lackluster performance against  &UR; Dana Rosenblatt  &LR; and, as
respectfully as possible, asked him to consider the possibility
that he was staying too long in the most dangerous sport. The story
goes she told Norris he is no longer the same person he once was,
physically or mentally, and should consider retirement. Norris has
agreed to fight  &UR; Laurent Boudouani tomorrow &LR;  in Paris for the WBA
junior middleweight title, so apparently he did not heed her
heartfelt warning ...  &UR; Salvador Jasso  &LR; has a unique perspective on
the upcoming De La Hoya-Quartey matchup because he has served as a
sparring partner for both. His opinion: ``Ike will knock you out
with two or three punches, but Oscar, he's fast and turns his hands
at the last second so it hurts. Oscar surprises you and then
explodes in your face. Ike can win with the jab and the hook, but
Oscar will go over the top if Ike drops his hands.''

STUCK WITH THANKSGIVING LEFTOVERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Scott Boras, the man who almost delivered Bernie Williams to
the Red Sox before George Steinbrenner perished that thought,
stated the obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet Dan Duquette is taking a lot of heat in Boston,'' said
Boras, ``but he was darn close to getting the guy. I think instead
of criticizing him, the fans in Boston should be happy that the
club was as competitive as it was trying to get Bernie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were under the impression that there was every chance
Bernie was not going to be a Yankee when we went to Atlanta (last
Sunday) to meet with the Red Sox. Truthfully, there was nothing
more Dan could have done other than substantially overpaying the
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great empathy for them, knowing how important the
player was to them, and knowing how close they were to getting him.
They were that close.''
</P>
<P>
   That is of little consolation, of course, to Red Sox fans, who
only see a gaping hole where Mo Vaughn used to be. The Sox not only
lost out on Williams, but bailed out on negotiations for Albert
Belle, who apparently has come to terms on a five-year, $65 million
deal with the AL East rival Orioles. That's about the same kind of
money the Sox offered Vaughn, so it apparently wasn't economics
that killed their interest in Belle, but character issues, though
no Sox official, including CEO John Harrington, will stand up and
say that's the reason.
</P>
<P>
   The dollars did steer the Sox away from Rafael Palmeiro, who
reportedly has received a five-year, $45 million offer to remain
with the Orioles. Duquette was not comfortable being tied that long
to the 34-year-old first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Where do the Sox go from here? Duquette's initial response was
that the team would pursue pitching. He said that neither Randy
Johnson nor Kevin Brown was interested in Boston, though Boras, who
represents Brown, said his client has never indicated that. Brown
will cost somebody more money than Pedro Martinez's six-year, $75
million deal, and Brown probably would choose Boston only if the
Sox outbid such well-heeled contenders as the Rockies, Dodgers,
Orioles, and Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Take away the top-of-the-line free agents, and the pickings for
pitching are slim. The Sox could sign a Tim Belcher or a Bob
Tewksbury, or perhaps trade for a Pedro Astacio, but none of those
names is a fit for the No. 2 starter sought by the club. Roger
Clemens? A nice fantasy, but the Blue Jays will eventually move him
elsewhere for more than they could get from the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   On the offensive side, Duquette has explored a trade for Expos
outfielder Rondell White, but Montreal officials have indicated
that, so far, it's not a good match. The Sox could inquire about
the availability of the Big Hurt, Frank Thomas, who was on the
market at the end of last season, but it's unclear the White Sox
would move him, especially with Belle not coming back to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, only 30, is an intriguing thought, especially since it's
likely that last season's .265 average was an aberration for a man
who began 1998 with a lifetime average of .330. He's also a first
baseman, albeit a reluctant one who prefers to DH, and the White
Sox picked up another first baseman, Paul Konerko, this fall from
Cincinnati. During the summer, the Red Sox had floated a
Vaughn-Thomas swap past the White Sox, and while club sources
insist the teams have not talked recently about Thomas, it would
seem to be a logical avenue to revisit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would move $10 million man Gary Sheffield, who has
been erratic and hurt the last couple of years, and might even
consider dealing outfielder Raul Mondesi, about whom the Red Sox
inquired last winter. With Jay Buhner most likely having to move to
first, slick-fielding David Segui could be available from Seattle,
for whom he posted some of the best offensive numbers of his career
last season (.305, 19 home runs, 84 RBIs).
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman's Kansas City teammate, Johnny Damon, could
attract some interest from the Sox. Damon, 25, has yet to show the
star quality the Royals anticipated when he broke into their
lineup, but while his offensive numbers remain modest (.277, 18,
66), his power numbers have jumped over his first two seasons and
he could be on the verge of a breakout year. The Sox could also
take a run at the Marlins' Cliff Floyd, a lefthanded-hitting first
baseman/outfielder who hit 22 home runs and drove in 90 runs for
baseball's weakest team.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's winter meetings begin a week from Friday in
Nashville, where Duquette is expected to be one of the most active
players in Music City. He has little choice.
</P>
<P>
   How hectic have recent days been for Boras? He called home at
one point, only to discover that his wife and three kids had moved
into their new house in Southern California. Boras knew the move
was in the works but had lost track of time and didn't realize the
vans would be coming while he was away.
</P>
<P>
   Boras was asked how he would respond to the charge that he
played Duquette as a means of driving up the price for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is so clear that wasn't the case,'' he said.
``But even if we did do that, that's the market. The Boston Red Sox
made a fair-market offer, and the fans should be more upset if the
team's ownership hadn't been competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras spent an hour Friday night on the telephone, explaining
the series of events that ultimately led to Williams becoming a
Yankee and the Red Sox being left with an empty plate on
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, when Duquette flew to Atlanta to meet with Williams
and Boras, the Yankees had made just one offer to Williams, a
five-year deal for $60 million that Boras would not even
acknowledge. The other team most interested in Williams was the
Arizona Diamondbacks, whose manager, Buck Showalter, is very close
to Williams from their days together with the Yankees. Boras would
not confirm what Arizona was prepared to pay, but he did say there
was one team in the Williams sweepstakes willing to guarantee the
center fielder more than $90 million for seven years, and
presumably that was Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette initially had made a run at Belle when talks broke off
with Vaughn, but when it became evident to him that there really
was a chance Williams would leave the Yankees, he made a powerful
presentation to the American League batting champion, bringing in
manager Jimy Williams on Monday to reinforce his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy and Dan made a very positive impact on Bernie,'' Boras
said. ``Dan, I'm telling you, really handled the situation well. I
thought his timing was perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimy and Bernie had a delightful three- or four-hour
conversation. And I've been around many GMs in these situations,
and they're very uncomfortable with the player. Dan was not like
that at all. This guy impressed me. He did a great job on Bernie.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in their conversation, according to Boras, Duquette
asked Williams point-blank why the center fielder of the World
Series-winning Yankees would want to leave. Boras said that both he
and the player responded by telling the Sox GM that if the Yankees
were willing to pay him his fair-market value, he wouldn't be going
anywhere. They never told the Red Sox otherwise, he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees had not done so, and instead were in the hunt
for Belle as well as exploring a trade for Montreal's White.
</P>
<P>
   That day, Duquette not only made a seven-year offer, Boras said,
but the sides discussed all the other details that go into a
contract of this magnitude: incentive clauses, performance bonuses,
and the like. The Sox balked at a no-trade clause, but in the end,
they even gave some ground there, putting in an additional $2
million payment if Williams was traded in the fifth year of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Boras said Williams was prepared to choose Boston over Arizona,
mainly because he had questions about how long it would be before
the expansion Diamondbacks would be competitive. But then late
Monday night, Yankees GM Brian Cashman called Boras, asking for
another chance to talk. And, at Boras's suggestion, Williams called
Cashman, and a meeting was set for the next day in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Williams and Steinbrenner, who takes a far more
proactive role in such matters than a Harrington, met face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them not to talk about money,'' Boras said, ``but talk
about whether they were prepared for life without one another.''
</P>
<P>
   They had a frank discussion, Boras said, and when it was over,
the agent said he told Steinbrenner where the market was for his
client, and what it would take to keep him. Steinbrenner, he said,
asked for more time. Boras said he would need an answer by the next
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told George that was D-Day,'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday morning, Boras said he could tell by the morose
expression on Williams's face that he didn't want to leave the
Yankees, the team with which he had grown up. He'd run into
teammate Derek Jeter at the Yankees' complex and clearly was torn
about leaving. Boras advised the player that he could take more
time on a decision, but Williams replied that he was prepared to go
to Boston if the Yankees didn't come across with a better offer.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees officials, including Cashman, said they were convinced
that Steinbrenner would not go to seven years. And, as Peter
Gammons describes elsewhere on these pages, that afternoon, the
Yankees were rebuffed on an attempt to make a deal for the Expos'
White.
</P>
<P>
   Boras was in Denver, meeting with Rockies officials about Brown,
when Steinbrenner called. At first, the Rockies executive who took
the call was reluctant to interrupt the session, perhaps fearing
that Steinbrenner wanted to place a bid on Brown. But eventually,
Boras was summoned, and after a 40-minute conversation with the
Boss, a deal was done.
</P>
<P>
   And the Sox were left out in the cold. Duquette, who had hoped
to be receiving a call saying Williams was Boston-bound, instead
received the same news as the Diamondbacks, that Williams was
staying put.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   They're already making jokes in Baltimore about who will wear
No. 8, Belle or  &UR; Cal Ripken  &LR; ... Sox catcher  &UR; Jason
Varitek &LR; , &UR;  &LR; contrary to what club officials had said initially, will
require surgery on the index finger of his throwing hand, which he
fractured playing winter ball in Puerto Rico. The surgery is no
different from that which  &UR; Steve Avery  &LR; required when he fractured
his left index finger playing football, according to Boras, who
represents both players ... The Blue Jays are reeling from manager
 &UR; Tim Johnson's  &LR; forced confession last Monday that he'd lied about
doing a tour of duty in Vietnam, when, as a member of the US Marine
Reserves, he never left the States. Johnson's imagined war stories
to his players included tales of having to shoot women and
children, according to published reports. He also lied about having
been an All-America high school basketball player and rejecting a
scholarship to play hoops at UCLA. GM  &UR; Gord Ash  &LR; praised Johnson's
``tremendous character and courage'' for coming clean, but what
choice did he have after the lies became public knowledge? Johnson
was well-liked by Sox players when he served as  &UR; Kevin Kennedy's
 &LR; bench coach in Boston, and he led the Blue Jays on their run at
the Sox last September, but once someone in his position has lost
his credibility, how can he be expected to retain a job in which
the trust of his players and the public is so crucial? Imagine the
outcry among veterans groups if Johnson were managing in a US city.
Even Ash's credibility was affected. He initially dismissed reports
about Johnson's deceit as tabloid-style journalism. Johnson, who
underwent counseling in the team's employee assistance program, was
asked by  &UR; Mike Rutsey  &LR; of the Toronto Sun why he had lied. ``It's
not like I told a lot of people,'' Johnson said. ``There are times
where I said some things I shouldn't have said. Why? Who knows?
Guilt? Maybe. I don't think it was to impress them. I think it was
more guilt (about having not gone to Vietnam) and, you know,
sometimes it's not knowing what the reason was. Maybe I feel I
should have been there with the buddies who went and I didn't.''

   Remember  &UR; Andy Yount &LR; , &UR;  &LR; the former Sox No. 1 draft pick whose
career appeared to have come to a tragic end when he severed the
tendon of the middle finger of his pitching hand? Yount sustained
the injury when a glass, or glass bottle, shattered in his hand at
the gravesite of a friend killed in a car accident. The tendon
would not stay in place, and reportedly Yount has had nine
operations on the finger. The Red Sox released him (according to
Baseball America, he found out when his father read the news in the
transactions), but after a tryout in which he was throwing in the
low 90s, the Tigers signed him for $60,000 and invited him to the
instructional league. If Yount can develop another pitch to go
along with his fastball, Tigers officials said, he could succeed in
his improbable comeback ... Rockies infielder  &UR; Mike Lansing
 &LR; learned that he is afflicted with Bell's palsy, which affects
facial nerves but is believed to be a temporary condition. Team
trainer  &UR; Thomas Probst  &LR; said the condition is unrelated to the
numbness Lansing felt last spring in his left leg, from his knee to
his toes, which affected his play early in the season. Lansing said
there is still a slight numbness in his foot. Lansing, who signed a
four-year, $23.25 million contract after being acquired from the
Expos last November, hit .276 in his first year with the Rockies
with 12 home runs and 66 RBIs. However, he was hitting only .239
with three home runs and 17 RBIs as late as June 18 ... There has
been little rest this offseason for National League MVP  &UR; Sammy
Sosa &LR; , &UR;  &LR; but he's not worried. ``If I had time, I would be on
vacation,'' Sosa said. ``But I'm taking care of the people of my
country. The MVP is great. Sixty-six home runs are great. But when
I go home (to the Dominican Republic), I know a lot of people don't
have anything. No house, nothing. They only have one hope and I'm
trying to come through for them.'' ... Good news for the Cubs on
the  &UR; Kerry Wood  &LR; front. The National League Rookie of the Year, who
missed the last month of the season with a sore elbow, apparently
has been given a clean bill of health after an MRI on his elbow
just before the holiday. GM  &UR; Ed Lynch  &LR; said Wood should be ready
for the start of spring training ... Finally, just whom do you
think this quote refers to? ``He's one of those guys who makes a
team better in a lot of ways. He gives us that big horse in the
middle of the lineup and that takes some of the pressure off the
other guys. We still have a lot of young players who were suddenly
on the firing line in September. He is not afraid to stand up and
say, `Let's not be intimidated, we're as good as anybody.'
Leadership in the clubhouse is very important if done the right
way. He prepares right and plays right. He carries credibility.''
Mo Vaughn, of course. The speaker? Angels manager  &UR; Terry Collins &LR; .

INSIDE STORY ON OUTDOOR DEAL

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Why did Edmonton land the 2001 world outdoor track and field
championships instead of Stanford? There were government guarantees
worth $80 million. Alberta promised to pay travel and
accommodations costs for all athletes and officials and offered a
fat Canadian TV deal.
</P>
<P>
   Though Stanford, which has been spurned thrice in a row, had an
attractive package, it couldn't match what amounted to full public
underwriting, and won only two of 24 votes. That was a body blow
for USA Track and Field, which was counting on the event (which the
US has never hosted), to boost the sport's sagging spectator
interest here.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Just to make sure there's no repeat of Atlanta's high-wire
financing for the 2002 Winter Games, the Salt Lake City organizers
and the Utah state government have agreed that no more than 60
percent of the $1.45 billion budget will be spent or committed
before next October, that the committee will always keep a reserve
fund of at least $100 million in the bank, and that the state
auditor will continue to have continuous access to the books ...
After basking in their Golden Girl glow for 10 months, the US
women's ice hockey team will be in action for the first time since
Nagano against Canada and Finland in next month's Three Nations Cup
in Finland. Eleven Olympians, including  &UR; Cammi Granato &LR; , &UR; Karyn
Bye &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and &UR; Sara DeCosta &LR; , &UR;  &LR; are on the squad, which will be directed
by Wisconsin head coach  &UR; Julie Sasner &LR;  ... No surprises in the
men's ice hockey relegation tournament for the A pool at next
year's world championships in Norway. As expected, the US and host
Austria breezed past Estonia and Kazakhstan. The Yanks, who sent
over a patchwork crew of off-duty German League pros and golden-age
volunteers, won all three of their games ... The US men's doubles
team stayed on its Nagano roll in the first two World Cup luge
events. It grabbed three of the top four places in the Innsbruck
opener, with  &UR; Christian Niccum &LR; - &UR; Matt McClain  &LR; and  &UR; Mark
Grimmette &LR; - &UR; Brian Martin  &LR; going 1-2.  &UR; yesterday &LR;  in Altenberg,
Germany,  &UR; Chris Thorpe  &LR; and  &UR; Gordy Sheer  &LR; took the bronze.
Rebuilding season for the men's and women's singles, who haven't
come close to the podium yet. Rough start, too, for Somerville's
 &UR; Erin Warren &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who figured to be the top US woman but has yet to
crack the top 20 ... Looks like there'll be a minimal US presence
at the Grand Prix figure skating final in Russia in March. After
four of six events, only  &UR; Michael Weiss &LR; , &UR; Nicole Bobek &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and the
pair of  &UR; Kyoko Ina  &LR; and  &UR; John Zimmerman  &LR; figure to qualify. With
 &UR; Michelle Kwan  &LR; and  &UR; Todd Eldredge  &LR; sitting out the circuit and
 &UR; Jenni Meno &LR; - &UR; Todd Sand  &LR; (pairs) and  &UR; Elizabeth Punsalan &LR; - &UR; Jerod
Swallow  &LR; (dance) turned pro, the Yanks are thin. Not so the
Russians, who'll be favored to win all four titles and could sweep
the men ... After years of looking at thousands of empty seats
inside Detroit's Joe Louis Arena, the US Figure Skating Association
has switched next year's Skate America to the new 8,000-seat World
Arena in Colorado Springs ... Home cookin' paid off for the US
bobsledders, who finished second ( &UR; Brian Shimer &LR; ) and fifth ( &UR; Todd
Hays &LR; ) in Friday's World Cup two-man event on the Olympic run at
Salt Lake City after a sluggish debut at Calgary. Winchester's  &UR; Jim
Herberich  &LR; has been 12th and 14th in the two-man races, 14th in the
first four-man ... The US short-track speedskaters keep cruising on
the World Cup circuit _ both  &UR; Amy Peterson  &LR; and Brookline's  &UR; Dan
Weinstein  &LR; set American records in the 500 at Heerenveen and
 &UR; Apolo &LR;   &UR; Ohno  &LR; won the 1,000 in Hungary. Nice start, too, by
long-tracker  &UR; Christine Witty &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who won a silver and a bronze in
the first two 1,500s of the season.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   How far have the US men slipped on the global weightlifting
scene? Only junior  &UR; Oscar Chaplin III  &LR; met the qualifying standard
for the recent world championships in Finland, and he placed 13th.
Better showing by the US women, who got a bronze from  &UR; Robin Goad
 &LR; at 53 kilograms, a fourth from  &UR; Cara Heads  &LR; at 75 kg, and a sixth
from  &UR; Tara Nott  &LR; at 48 kg. The Greeks dominated the men's event,
winning three of eight golds and five medals in all. The Chinese
and Taiwanese grabbed six of the seven women's titles ... ``Mind
Over Water,''  &UR; Craig Lambert's  &LR; lovely new book on rowing and its
life lessons, includes some intriguing Olympic-related nuggets,
most of them involving the mystical  &UR; Harry Parker &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who both
sculled and coached in the Games. A terrific read, even if you
can't tell a pair from a double ... Looks like it'll be a long road
back to the medal podium for the rebuilding US men's and women's
volleyball teams, who both got spiked at the world championships in
Japan. The men, who won the bronze medal last time, were bounced in
the quarterfinal round and are playing for ninth-12th place this
weekend. The women didn't win a game in their preliminary pool.
Worse yet, the US males were fined $3,000 (along with six other
teams) for a fashion faux pas: loose-fitting shirts.

BRUINS GOING IN RIGHT DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the tail end of the Bruins' Western swing in October, there
were signs that the club was far from a cohesive unit. The team
defense was porous and the goal scoring was inconsistent.
Fortunately, the goaltending was terrific, but Boston still went
through a 1-5-1 stretch from Oct. 19-Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   In the 10 games since then, the Bruins have rolled along at a
6-1-3 clip, their most recent victory a 5-1 thrashing of Montreal
Friday afternoon. Why the turnabout? There are a number of factors:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Defenseman Kyle McLaren and forward Anson Carter, who were
embroiled in contract disputes and missed the first 15 and 12
games, respectively, have looked more and more effective.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Center Jason Allison, who missed all but one exhibition game
because of a contract squabble, is back to 100 percent after a bout
with the flu.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Right wing Dmitri Khristich, who was up and down last year
partly because of a distraction over his contract, has been the
team's most consistent forward and is on a scorching scoring pace,
with 25 points in 21 games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Sophomore forward Sergei Samsonov is benefiting from playing
with Allison and Khristich, and even though opponents are targeting
him, he's finding a way to score.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Defenseman Darren Van Impe, who looked tentative at times
last year, is playing with a great deal more confidence and has
been the missing ingredient on the power play, which is among the
league's best.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ &LR; Byron Dafoe has embraced the starting goalie job he earned
last year, and after the snubbing on the All-Star ballot, he has
played with an even more pronounced ``Take that!'' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, don't think for a minute that coach Pat Burns
will allow his players to become complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet, we're far from being there,'' said Burns
after the win over the Habs. ``We have a lot of work to go. We have
a lot of things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the dimensions the team is missing is the one brought by
center Tim Taylor, who has been sidelined for 18 of 22 games
because of a balky ankle that he sprained Oct. 14 in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris (Taylor, Tim's brother) is doing a fabulous job, don't
get me wrong,'' said Burns. ``But we do miss Tim. Kyle is finding a
way to compensate for the training camp he missed. He's playing
much better every game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we didn't say it was going to be a
one-year-and-two-month changeover. We're still going to get our
butts kicked some night, we know that. There are going to be a lot
of highs and some lows. (Last) week has been a high for us. Two
weeks from now, we might have a low. I'm not that dumb, I'm not
going to tell you we're there yet. I hope we're not there yet. We
have a lot of things to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Right wing Rob DiMaio, who expressed acute frustration earlier
in the year when so many free agents were out of the lineup, said
he can see the club coming together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' said DiMaio. ``Just one guy is missing.
When Timmy gets back, it will be a big boost. We don't have to
change anything. We're going pretty much with a lot of confidence.
We're not trying to do too much. We're just keeping it simple. Our
power play is working real well, the penalty killing is working
real well. If we can do that for another 60 games, we should be
OK.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is an area DiMaio would like to see improved, it is his
line's offensive output, which has been hampered by the absence of
Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been creating too much,'' said DiMaio. ``I've been
frustrated as well as (P.J. Axelsson) and Chris. If the rest of the
team wasn't scoring, then there would be real cause to worry but
we're still shutting other team's lines down as much as we can and
we've done our job. When Timmy gets back, we kind of jell a little
bit more. We understand the way each other plays and we get our
offense from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who is champing at the bit to get back, said that when
he was with the Red Wings, the players felt the pressure to win.
The pressure isn't as intense in Boston, since it's understood that
the Bruins are a young club. But he doesn't see any reason why the
expectations here shouldn't be high.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the most realization I had at how close we were
because the team that barely knocked us out is a team that went to
the Stanley Cup finals,'' said Taylor, referring to the Washington
Capitals. ``You look in our division and it's pretty tight because
teams are playing really well. We're one of the top teams (in the
East).''
</P>
<P>
   As positive as the attitude has been around the club _ winning
has a way of doing that _ no one is jumping the gun. After all,
only 22 games have been played.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just say automatically that now we're a Stanley Cup
contender,'' said DiMaio. ``We just have to play consistent and
play within ourselves every night and let our confidence build. We
are young and the better guys play, the more confidence we're going
to have and the better we're going to get.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking this season in quarters and we're at the end of
the first quarter. We've got a lot of hockey left to play. Maybe
toward the end we can start talking like that a little bit more but
not now.''

GRIPPING QB DRAMA ABOUT TO UNFOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ When Bob Kraft arrived at Foxboro Stadium Friday
following a Thanksgiving Day respite, he wanted to know two things.
(1) Would Drew Bledsoe play against the Bills. And (2) Where did
all of those mail bins with thousands of letters come from?
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, there was no conclusive evidence as to whether Bledsoe
would start or not as the team went through its walk-through
practice at the stadium. According to team spokesman Stacey James,
Bledsoe only handed the ball off to his backs and did not throw.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe certainly will be active Sunday and will test his broken
finger in pregame warmups. His status will be a game-time decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at that point he can't throw the ball with accuracy or
authority, he won't go,'' said James.
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe's right index finger was broken in two places during the
game-winning drive last Monday night against Miami. He has been
wearing a brace on it and said he would not be able to play if it
was in the same condition it was on that dramatic drive, even
though he did not come out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   As for the mail, it contained letters and checks from more than
20,000 fans who want their names put on a season-ticket waiting
list, tripling the number on the list from 10,000 to 30,000 in
about a week since Kraft announced he was moving the team to
Hartford in 2001. Approximately 30 percent of the additions are
from Massachusetts fans, mostly from the western suburbs, while the
remainder are mostly from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing to see it all,'' said Kraft. ``It just
reaffirms what great fans we have in New England.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the fans rallied around the team in the 26-23 win over
the Dolphins, one of the best games the stadium has ever hosted.
But with Doug Flutie making his return to Foxborough, where he's
10-0, will the locals become Bills fans in a hurry if the Patriots
don't stay in the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that will happen,'' said coach Pete Carroll.
``Our fans will support us and root for us. I can say that with
certainty based on the way the fans responded last week. They will
be respectful of Doug and applaud him because of all the great
things he's done in this area, but they'll be rooting for us to win
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   With Bledsoe's status in doubt, teammates mustered something of
a rallying cry for Zolak in the past week. Kraft noticed it Friday
when several of them came to him and said they could win with
Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Johnson seemed to start it early in the week when he said,
``If Drew can't play, there's nobody I'd rather have in there than
Scott, he's so fiery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think players feel very comfortable with Zolak,'' said Shawn
Jefferson. ``He brings that attitude that we like to see. He's a
winner. He'll do anything to win. If he can't find anyone open,
he'll still try to find a way to make a play. I think we'll be all
right with Scott in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if there is a change in quarterbacks, the Patriots aren't
expected to change much of what they planned. The spread-out
offense that worked so well against Miami will be seen at times,
but the Patriots want to reestablish the running game. Robert
Edwards has disappeared the past five weeks, and that must change
as the Patriots head into a bad-weather month.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie, of course will be sky high. He was hoping to go
head-to-head with Bledsoe in a marquee matchup, with the two teams
jousting for position the AFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last week's game was a signature game for Drew,'' said
Flutie. ``It may change the way a lot of people view him there.''

 &HT;    Kick completes Chambers' odyssey
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Brad Chambers figured he'd been to ``every Georgia
Tech-Georgia game since I've been alive.'' He wasn't alive in 1957,
but he knows who Theron Sapp is: ``The guy who scored the touchdown
against Georgia Tech.'' And he knows one thing more: ``Something
about Georgia always gave me the creeps.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day Brad Chambers gave the Bulldogs something in return:
The drought-ending, pride-rending blues. His field goal at 0:02
hoisted Chambers into Yellow Jacket lore. And just who is Brad
Chambers? Here, as they say in Hollywood, is the backstory:
</P>
<P>
   He learned to kick in his Toccoa backyard, booting a ball over a
neighbor's power lines. ``It didn't matter if it was straight or
not; it just had to get over.'' He got serious about kicking not
because he foresaw the day when he'd fell the Dogs between the
hedges, but because he got tired of his sister showing him up.
Ginny Chambers was, her brother said, ``the only girl in the
neighborhood, and she was the best kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   He came to Tech as a walk-on. (His sister went to Auburn, not as
a placekicker. She works in Nashville now.) Chambers was issued a
scholarship after his freshman season. Having worn No. 31, he asked
for a different uniform. Only No. 13 was left. He took it. On the
first day of practice, Chambers said, ``All the coaches said,
`We're not having a kicker wearing 13.' But they never took it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't to say that Chambers' collegiate career was all good
fortune. He kicked a 20-yard winner against Clemson last season but
missed four of five field goals at Maryland on Halloween 1998. He'd
been bad in practice this week, he said, and his first try Saturday
clanked off the left upright. Even a later success, a career-long
49-yarder with 5:01 left, earned none of its three points for
style. ``Ugly,'' Chambers called the line drive.
</P>
<P>
   That brought Tech within a point. The Bulldogs went
three-and-out. Tech proceeded downfield, Chambers ducked behind the
bench to kick into a net, monitoring events on the big screen. When
finally he was summoned, five seconds remained.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia called one timeout, then another. ``That didn't make me
nervous,'' Chambers said. ``The only thing was, my mouth got
completely dry.''
</P>
<P>
   He received this sage counsel from coach George O'Leary: ``Just
make it, son.'' Afterward O'Leary opined that the timeouts had
actually helped his kicker: ``He started getting the color back in
his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Basquin, the holder, told Chambers: ``Don't worry about
the laces _ you won't see them.'' Basquin had another viewing tip:
``He told me to keep my head down the whole time,'' Chambers said.
``He said, `You'll know it's good if I jump on top of you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Duly prepped, Chambers stepped forward and swung his leg. He
didn't see the ball rise above the leaping Champ Bailey, didn't see
it arch toward the goal posts and the sea of Tech fans beyond,
didn't see anything but ground and then sky after his holder flung
him to the turf. Other Jackets followed forthwith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a bruise right here,'' Brad Chambers said, touching his
sternum. He'll take it. Better a celebratory bruise than a
continuing case of the creeps.

 &HT;    Tech D's big day: Stops at end set stage
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ It started with the Georgia team stomping its own
logo at midfield. It ended with the Bulldogs bickering among
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Georgia Tech staged a remarkable fourth-quarter
comeback after trailing 19-7, ending a seven-year drought by taking
a last-second, 21-19 win.
</P>
<P>
   As many Tech offensive heroes as there were, the unsung, often
maligned Yellow Jackets defenders finally stood up and demanded to
be counted. In three hours and 13 minutes, Tech erased seven years
of frustration and ensured itself state supremacy and a top-15
ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's defense had given up 399 yards per game this season, next
to last in the ACC. Saturday, the Bulldogs managed 384, but only 5
of them came on Georgia's last two possessions. Tech sent the
Bulldogs off the field with back-to-back four-and-out sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of trash-talking,'' said defensive end Felipe
Claybrooks, who had a sack and two pass breakups. More important,
Claybrooks stayed in Bulldog quarterback Quincy Carter's face much
of the afternoon. The two have known each other since Claybrooks
played at Decatur and Carter at Southwest DeKalb. ``We talked the
whole game,'' Claybrooks said. ``I'd say `Hey, don't blame me for
you getting hit. Blame your offensive linemen.' Stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior defensive end Jesse Tarplin called his defense together
in the late going when it became apparent Tech had a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them we needed a four-and-out,'' he said. ``We hadn't
had one all day. I told them we needed to get the ball back to our
offense fast. We knew we had a chance because they were rattled (on
their last two possessions). They were arguing back there among
themselves. Quincy was on his linemen and the linemen were accusing
each other, telling each other to block.''
</P>
<P>
   Tarplin had five tackles and often accompanied Claybrooks into
the Bulldog backfield. As he left the field, a fan dumped a Coke on
his head, but his mood was too good to be dampened by a soft drink.
``That comes with the territory,'' he said. ``I told (my teammates)
not to get mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Claybrooks said the Tech defense knew what to expect when they
went out on the Bulldogs' last two possessions. ``(Defensive line)
Coach (Lance) Thompson called the front four together and told us
to remember their tendencies. We knew Quincy would have the ball in
his hands, so Coach Thompson told us to pressure him. He told us to
make plays, pressure Quincy, stay with your man. I think we worked
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive lineman Nate Stimson perhaps put the afternoon in
perspective, recalling last year's 27-24 loss in the last 48
seconds to the Bulldogs. ``It's worse to lose a game by one point
than by 50. I hope they feel bad.''

 &HT;    Doggone good kick
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach

<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The drought is over.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's seven-year misery against Georgia ended Saturday
on Brad Chambers' 35-yard field goal with two seconds left, which
gave the No. 17 Yellow Jackets a 21-19 upset of the No. 12 Bulldogs
at Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tech's first win over the Bulldogs since its co-national
championship season of 1990, breaking the second-longest losing
streak in the series. Georgia Tech finished the regular season at
9-2, its best mark in eight years, and will play an undetermined
opponent in Jacksonville's Gator Bowl on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which fell to 8-3, must wait to learn its postseason
fate, most likely an invitation to the Citrus or Outback Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time for them to feel like we've felt for the
last seven years, especially last season,'' Georgia Tech
quarterback Joe Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The final minutes of Saturday's game probably seemed familiar to
much of the sold-out crowd of 86,117. Three hundred and sixty-four
days after Georgia won on an 8-yard touchdown pass with eight
seconds left in Atlanta, the Yellow Jackets put together their own
game-winning drive in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This year's edition of the intrastate rivalry also ended with
some controversy _ Georgia's players felt they'd recovered a fumble
during Tech's final drive, and that Dogs quarterback Quincy Carter
crossed the goal line on a failed two-point conversion attempt
earlier. Last year's game ended after a controversial
pass-interference call against Georgia Tech in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 19-18 with less than four minutes remaining, Tech
started its final drive at its 30-yard line. The Jackets reached
Georgia territory on Hamilton's 14-yard run. The junior quarterback
appeared to fumble, with Dogs safety Larry Mann recovering at the
Georgia 31, but officials ruled Hamilton was down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he fumbled, but I'm not the one making the call,''
Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Tech faced third-and-11 at the 32. Following
a timeout, Hamilton hit senior Charlie Rogers with a short pass in
the right flat, which Rogers turned into a 13-yard gain to the 19.
Tech split end Mike Sheridan picked off Georgia cornerback Champ
Bailey on the play, allowing Rogers to break free down the
sideline. After a 1-yard run and a pair of timeouts by Georgia,
Chambers nailed his game-winning field goal through the uprights in
the west end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Chambers) looked spaced out walking onto the field,'' Georgia
Tech coach George O'Leary said. ``I think those two timeouts helped
him. He got some color back in his face.''
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 19-7, the Yellow Jackets finally found life
at the start of the fourth quarter. After converting on fourth
down, freshman Joe Burns scored on a 10-yard run to make it 19-13.
O'Leary chose to go for a two-point coversion, and Hamilton
succeeded on a run around right end, cutting the Dogs' lead to
19-15 with 13:00 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, a senior from Toccoa, kicked a career-long 49-yard
field goal with 5:01 left to cut Georgia's lead to 19-18.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's offense, which produced 278 yards and 19 points in the
first three quarters, went dormant in the fourth. The Bulldogs had
only nine offensive plays and 14 yards on their final three drives,
allowing the Yellow Jackets to hold the ball for more than 10
minutes in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tech) didn't do anything differently,'' Georgia offensive
tackle Matt Stinchcomb said. ``We just didn't execute. It's our job
to put them away. We didn't, and gave them the opportunity to come
back down the field and put the game away.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's defense also had its problems in the fourth quarter,
allowing Tech to gain 163 yards on 30 plays in its final four
series. The Yellow Jackets rushed for 241 yards, the second-highest
total the Bulldogs have allowed this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our inability to slow them down really bothered all of us,''
Georgia coach Jim Donnan said. ``They converted too many third-down
plays and some fourth downs.

 &HT;    Give the boot to series' latest drought
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Another drought has been broken, but this time the
shoe was on the other foot, so to speak. Georgia had lost to
Georgia Tech eight times in a row when Theron Sapp, a solid but
plodding fullback from Macon, planted his brogans in the end zone
at Grant Field and Georgia earned its third victory of the 1957
season, 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Drought Is Broken,'' they cried in a delirium that spread
across the state. Sapp still lives in the hearts of Bulldogs as
``The Man Who Broke the Drought,'' today a restaurant operator in
his 60s in Augusta. Now Georgia Tech has a match for him.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Chambers is a 22-year-old senior, tall and lean, from just
up the road at Toccoa, playing his last game against Georgia. When
he put his shoe to the football in Sanford Stadium Saturday
afternoon, five seconds remained in the game. The distance was 35
yards. He stood there alone while Georgia called two timeouts, to
``freeze'' him in the term of gamesmanship. The number ``13''
glistened on his shirt in the lowering sun. Would it be the symbol
of foul luck, or would it be one to be revered in Tech's football
memory? He had kicked one from 49 yards earlier, a wobbling liner,
ugly but good, the longest of his college life.
</P>
<P>
   His kick was true and with Chambers' field goal Georgia Tech had
broken a drought of its own, seven seasons of defeat by Georgia,
and delirium of another sort broke out, this one in the color of
Gold and White. There was no time left for rebuttal, two ticks left
on the clock.
</P>
<P>
   As the college game goes, this was one for the museum. Old
rivalries are known to fade and die away, with the intrusion of
television and the rupture of conferences, and this one had been on
the wane. Georgia Tech had split from the Southeastern Conference
and the same spirit of vengeance just wasn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   With the arrival of George O'Leary in Atlanta and Jim Donnan in
Athens, however, the tempest thickened. The ``good old-fashioned
hate,'' as my friend Bill Cromartie has labeled it, was welling up.
A crucial officiating call in the last 30 seconds had slugged Tech
in the chops last year, robbed the Yellow Jackets of a game they
were already taking to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   So here we were again, this time in Sanford Stadium, stuffed to
the gills with 86,117 spectators of one denomination or the other.
This was college football rivalry as it's supposed to be, the way
it used to be when Harvard played Yale. The tension was thick.
There was a personal thing between the two quarterbacks, Joe
Hamilton at the position Quincy Carter might have been playing had
he not turned his back on Georgia Tech, first to pro baseball, then
to the Bulldogs. That sore had been festering.
</P>
<P>
   It is hardly possible for two teams to be more evenly matched.
It was supposed that Tech had an edge in the kicking game and
moving the ball on foot, Georgia on defense. True, a kick made the
difference, and while Rodney Williams' punting average was 45.8,
freshman Wynn Kopp, a kind of desperation choice, a local kid, had
himself a day kicking for the Bulldogs. He got good rolls and good
coverage when they needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Proof that not all such augury works out on the field, it looked
as if Georgia had put the game away on a grinding drive of 65 yards
on which running back Olandis Gary, a senior from Washington, D.C.,
was the workhorse. In between Carter strikes to Tony Small,
Georgia's surest catcher, and Larry Brown, Gary carried the load
and scored the touchdown that made the score 19-7, and at that late
stage of the third quarter, the Bulldogs must have felt pretty
cozy.
</P>
<P>
   But, as you may now have reasoned, it was not to be. They had
scored their last point. Joe Burns put another touchdown on the
board for Georgia Tech, followed by Hamilton's two-point run, and
the rest was left to the foot from Toccoa.

 &HT;    Loss to Tech may cost Dogs trip to Citrus
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Only time will tell, but Georgia may have played
its way out of the Citrus Bowl with Saturday's 21-19 loss to
Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   With Florida (9-2) still a possibility for the Orange Bowl, the
Citrus would have given strong consideration to matching a 9-2
Georgia with the No. 2 team from the Big Ten on Jan. 1 in Orlando,
according to Chuck Rohe, the game's executive director. At 8-3,
Georgia's bowl options are not quite so clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it's really hard to say,'' said Georgia coach Jim
Donnan. ``When you lose your last one, you pretty much have to take
what they give you.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia might still get into the Citrus, which gets the No. 1
pick of remaining SEC teams after the Bowl Championship Series
makes its selections. If Tennessee and Florida both get into the
BCS, it appears Arkansas (9-2) would go the Cotton Bowl to play
Texas. That would leave the Citrus to choose among Georgia,
Kentucky (7-4), Alabama (7-4) and Mississippi State, which would be
8-4 if it loses in the SEC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   By rule, the Citrus could pick any of those teams, regardless of
record. If Georgia does not go to the Citrus, it appears the
Bulldogs are headed back to the Outback Bowl in Tampa, where they
beat Wisconsin last Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   More controversy
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's 27-24 win over Georgia Tech last year in Atlanta had a
controversial pass interference play that kept the Bulldogs'
winning drive alive. This one ended with a fair share of griping
from the Georgia side.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays caused the most reaction. Television replays showed
that Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter had apparently crossed the
goal line on a two-point conversion try with 3:13 left in the third
quarter. The ACC officiating crew, however, ruled that Carter was
stopped short. Those points were the difference in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on Georgia Tech's winning drive, quarterback Joe Hamilton
appeared to have fumbled on a 14-yard run along the Yellow Jacket
sideline. But officials ruled him down and Tech maintained
possession at the Georgia 31-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt in my mind it was a fumble,'' said Georgia's
Larry Mann, who fell on the loose ball. ``But I don't make the
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Donnan would not get pulled into the controversey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The refs didn't make any difference in this game,'' said
Donnan. ``They just whipped us.''
</P>
<P>
   Just thinking
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia wide receiver Michael Greer threw the first pass of
his college career Saturday, a 68-yard touchdown bomb to senior
tight end Larry Brown on the game's third play. Greer catches every
ball that's thrown to him, returns punts, and now throws it for
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brown posted his career high in receiving with 106 yards on
three catches. Brown has started 44 of 46 possible games in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   _ With Tommy Tuberville taking the job at Auburn on Saturday,
the odds are greater that assistant coach Rodney Garner will remain
at Georgia. If Bill Oliver had gotten the job, there would have
been a full-court press to hire Garner.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey passed the century mark in
total plays for the fifth straight game and sixth in the last
seven. Bailey was in the game against Tech for a total of 102 plays
(30 offense, 63 defense, nine special teams). He had four catches
for 38 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech notes
</P>
<P>
   _ Tech's nine victories are the most in a season since 1990,
when the Jackets went 11-0-1 and won the UPI national title.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tech has rushed for 560 yards over the last two games while
holding both opponents, Wake Forest and Georgia, to under 100 yards
on the ground. Tech's 241 yards rushing was the most given up by
the Georgia defense all season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freshman Kelly Campbell had only 10 catches for 76 yards this
season when he beat Georgia's Cory Robinson in the second quarter
for a 55-yard touchdown pass to tie the game at 7-7. That same pass
also gave Hamilton the school record for touchdown passes in a
season at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia notes
</P>
<P>
   _ Saturday's capacity crowd of 86,117 set an average attendance
record for Sanford Stadium. The total attendance for six games this
season was 513,710, an average of 85,618. That record surpasses the
old mark of 83,948 set in 1995.

 &HT;    Bummer cum laude
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ The stunned faces of former Georgia stars Randall
Godfrey and Hines Ward as they left Sanford Stadium on Saturday may
have said it all. The Bulldogs' senior class, left with the annual
assignment of beating archrival Georgia Tech, failed to accomplish
the feat.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's senior class of 15 scholarship players would have been
the fifth straight to graduate with an unblemished 4-0 record
against the Yellow Jackets. Instead, they're the first to lose to
Tech since 1990, the year before record-setting quarterback Eric
Zeier arrived on the Athens campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that it came on your watch, so to speak, makes it even
worse,'' senior offensive tackle Matt Stinchcomb said. ``That's
probably the best way to put it. It's not the way it happened, it's
just that it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   How it happened _ on Brad Chambers' 35-yard field goal with two
seconds left, which gave the Jackets a 21-19 win _ made it worse
for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to get out of here without ever losing to them, but
these things happen,'' senior defensive tackle Paul Snellings said.
</P>
<P>
   Said senior safety Kirby Smart, ``It wasn't the perfect scenario
at all. It definitely puts a damper on the season. Looking back, if
you had told me we'd be 8-3 and going to a bowl game, I might have
been satisfied. Right now, this definitely dampens our season.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter hurt
</P>
<P>
   Georgia quarterback Quincy Carter missed postgame interviews
while getting X-rays on his hand. The X-rays were negative. Carter,
a former Parade All-American from Southwest DeKalb High who once
signed with Georgia Tech, got the hand stepped on during the fourth
quarter. Carter completed 16 of 31 passes for 225 yards with no
touchdowns or interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Carter left the field at the beginning of the first half to get
fluids intravenously. He was hampered by the flu during Friday's
workout.
</P>
<P>
   Another Dog commitment
</P>
<P>
   Georgia picked up another verbal commitment on Saturday, this
one from Jackson High athlete Tavares Morgan, a preseason Super 11
pick by the Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, a 6-foot-1, 180-pound quarterback at Jackson, rushed for
500 yards and nine touchdowns, while throwing for 1,300 yards and
eight scores. He's expected to play defensive back or wideout at
Georgia. Morgan's brother, Montez Morgan, played at Georgia Tech.

 &HT;    The final push
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For all the frenzy with 86,117 fans in Sanford
Stadium, a seven-game Georgia Tech losing streak to Georgia on the
line, and 70 yards to go to the end zone and the sweetest of
redemptions for the Yellow Jackets, their huddle was a relatively
quiet place to be.
</P>
<P>
   About all tailback Phillip Rogers remembers hearing from Tech
quarterback Joe Hamilton other than play calls was a quick ``ball
security'' reminder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew what we had the opportunity to do,'' sophomore
receiver Dez White said. ``Everybody had fire in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 19-18 with 3:47 left, Hamilton started the Yellow
Jackets from their own 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 10 guys in there and me, playing Georgia with three
minutes left and a field goal to win, there's not much you need to
say,'' Hamilton said. ``All I said was `Relax, we've got a lot of
time. There's no rush.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So Tech started rushing, but only in the football sense, with
six consecutive running plays.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton started it off with a bootleg run to his left for 6
yards. Then he handed off to Phillip Rogers on a pair of runs of 13
and 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got the ball I was going to run people over,'' Rogers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton carried again up the right side for a 14-yard gain and
came near disaster. He was tackled by linebacker Adrian
Hollingshed, who jarred the ball loose. Georgia safety Larry Mann
came up with the loose ball, but the officials ruled Hamilton was
down. Tech resumed its assault at Georgia's 31 with 2:22 left.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out of a timeout, tailback Charlie Rogers got thrown for
a loss by Georgia nose guard Josh Mallard in the backfield. But two
plays later he caught a short pass on a crossing route and turned
it into a 13-yard gain on third-and-11 to set up the field goal
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Ralph Friedgen said Tech had used the play
once before in the game. It was drawn up to have receiver Mike
Sheridan run his route right in the path of Georgia's best
defender, Champ Bailey, who would be shadowing Rogers across the
field. Sheridan did his job and sealed Bailey off with a
basketball-style pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd been trying to pick me all day on that play,'' Bailey
said. ``I followed (Charlie Rogers) all the way and then I got
smacked. I don't know who it was, I just remember somebody saying
to me `gotcha.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Taking Bailey out of the key play on the drive was sweet for the
Yellow Jackets, who had been haunted by memories of Bailey for a
year. It was his 28-yard reception on a screen pass that set
Georgia off on its final drive in the Bulldogs' last-second 27-24
win over Tech last season.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Yellow Jackets have a drive of their own to savor. Ten
plays, 52 yards, Brad Chambers from 35 yards. Good. Tech wins
21-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs were the ones left without much to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know how they felt last year,'' Georgia safety Kirby
Smart said.

SYRACUSE BEATS MIAMI, 66-13  
 (HLW)

<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ For four years, Donovan McNabb has opened every
Syracuse game behind center. He has won 35 of them. His arm has
pulled back 938 times to throw spirals for more than 8,389 yards.
Seventy-seven of them have found an orange-helmeted receiver who
wound up in the end zone. Nineteen more times McNabb has found his
own way there by foot.
</P>
<P>
   With 11 minutes 11 seconds left Saturday in a 66-13 thrashing of
the Miami Hurricanes, Syracuse Coach Paul Pasqualoni let his
quarterback take leave of an adoring crowd of 49,521 at the Carrier
Dome for the final time.
</P>
<P>
   They roared as though they remembered every game, every throw,
every touchdown of McNabb's glorious career.
</P>
<P>
   As he hugged each member of the offense, the crowd grew louder.
When he stepped up on the bench and raised his helmet, they turned
it up again. Who needs the Heisman Trophy when you're in the
beloved company of Jim Brown, Floyd Little and the late Ernie
Davis?
</P>
<P>
   By the time Giovanni DeLoatch picked up Miami quarterback Kenny
Kelly's fumble and rumbled 28 yards for Syracuse's final touchdown,
the Orangemen had handed Miami its worst loss since 1944. They had
also insured an invitation to either the Sugar Bowl or Orange Bowl
and a guaranteed payday of $11 million as part of the Bowl
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   For McNabb, it was a fitting end to a stellar career. He threw
for 80 yards and two touchdowns, ran for 99 and three more.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional McNabb who bounced and twirled his way onto
the field for one final home game in a glorious four-year career.
He pounded his chest, blew kisses of appreciation to the crowd and
then dived into a pile with 12 other seniors who had helped the
Orangemen go 34-13 and win two Big East titles over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Then he and the Orangeman (8-3) turned all that energy loose on
the Hurricanes. Syracuse came into this matchup averaging 40.2
points and 433 yards of total offense, but had lost of six of its
last seven games with the Hurricanes. By halftime, the Orangemen
were ahead by 45-7, had 276 yards of total offense and were well on
their way to repeating as undisputed Big East champions.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set in a thrilling first quarter that featured two
sacks, three interceptions, a blocked punt, a 50-yard field goal, a
100-yard kickoff return and 31 points. Unfortunately for the
Hurricanes, Syracuse put up 24 of them.
</P>
<P>
   The thumping began on the opening drive when, facing third-and-7
on his 48, McNabb dropped back to pass but was immediately faced
with a swarm of white jerseys. He stepped up once, twice, then
tucked the ball under his arm and motored up the middle of the
field for 29 yards and the first down. On the next play, McNabb
triggered the option left and flicked the ball to tailback Dee
Brown, catapulting him 23 yards for a touchdown and a 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The next time Syracuse had the ball, right tackle Jeff Pilon
laid a block on Miami linebacker Michael Smith so devastating that
it not only helped clear the way for Steve Johnson's 16-yard
reverse, but also sent Smith's helmet 6 feet into the air. When the
drive stalled, Nate Trout kicked a career-best 50-yard field goal
to put Syracuse ahead by 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Hurricanes, who did not convert a first down until the final
two minutes of the first quarter, helped the Orangemen along. When
Andy Crosland dropped back to punt on the Miami 10, Vernon Banks
burst through the middle untouched.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked the ball down and the backup fullback Nick Sudano
gathered it at the 15. It was the 20th turnover the Orangemen had
forced this season. When McNabb threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to
Steve Johnson in the right corner of the end zone, Syracuse had
scored 118 points off turnovers this season.
</P>
<P>
   Miami stopped Syracuse's momentum momentarily with an
eight-play, 45-yard drive, capped by tailback Edgerrin James'
1-yard plunge. But the beat went on, beginning with the ensuing
kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was standing on the goal line when he caught the kickoff
and loped 100 yards up a huge lane on the left side of the field.
He did not even feel the breeze of a Hurricane defender as the lead
became 24-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Orangemen barely stopped to catch their breath in the second
quarter. They took just four plays and 1 minute 10 seconds to turn
Stan Gibbs' interception of a pass by Hurricane quarterback Scott
Covington into 7 more points; this time McNabb kept from 1 yard out
for the score.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing the game was getting out of hand, Miami Coach Butch
Davis decided to go for it on fourth-and-8 from Syracuse's 15-yard
line. Safety Jason Poles knocked down a pass intended for Santana
Moss, who was open briefly in the end zone. Then, on the 10th play
of a nearly six-minute drive, McNabb apparently got impatient.
</P>
<P>
   He turned a quarterback draw that looked like it might lose
yardage into a nifty 51-yard touchdown run. It began with a barely
perceptible head fake that sent linebacker Dan Morgan sailing.
</P>
<P>
   By the time McNabb drove the Orangemen 50 yards and scored his
third touchdown of the first half, Syracuse's 45th point, the
raucous crowd at the Carrier Dome was already talking about
possible bowl matchups for its Big East champions.
</P>
<P>
   Syracuse had a date in the Orange or the Sugar against either
Florida or Notre Dame depending on how the final weeks shook out.
</P>
<P>
   And McNabb would have one more big game to showcase his
extraordinary talent.

Fry's retirement drains color from coaching ranks
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Hayden Fry accepted the Iowa football coaching job in 1978,
he found himself reminiscing about his roots, his college days at
Baylor, when an athlete received room and board and $15 a month in
what was called laundry money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that big a deal,'' Fry said. ``You could find a
little dumplin' to do the wash and then take her out to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden was swamped with mail and phone calls from women's groups
in Iowa and elsewhere, offering to run him through the presoak and
rinse cycles. The lesson raised his sensitivity to a level Phil
Donahue would have envied.
</P>
<P>
   The young Hayden Fry was brash and uninhibited, nice qualities
in a quarterback, but sometimes a liability for a coach. It isn't
easy to picture him as an elder statesman, announcing his
retirement this week after 20 years as the coach of the Hawkeyes.
At 69, he had spent more than half his life in the business. Now it
was time, he said, his eyes puddling up, to call it a career. His
was one of the less likely sleigh rides college football has ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   He was just three years out of Baylor, a novice coach at his
alma mater, when SMU named him as a surprise choice to revive a
program that had fallen on hard times. He did it, too, leading SMU
to its first Southwest Conference title in 1966. The previous
season, SMU ended a six-year losing streak to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His players tried to carry him off the field after that 31-14
upset, but Hayden wrenched free and raced through the crowd. In the
Cotton Bowl tunnel leading to the locker rooms, he caught up with a
dejected Darrell Royal.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning close to the renowned Texas coach, he blurted out:
``Darrell, you whipped my rear end like a drum the last few years,
and I just wanted you to know how good it feels to finally beat
yours.''
</P>
<P>
   He was not always diplomatic, a quality other coaches found easy
to resent when Fry was establishing himself. But his teams played
hard and in defeat won respect. It was after watching a feisty SMU
team lose to heavily favored Michigan, in 1963, that Lee Iacocca
walked into the visitors' locker room and announced Ford's new
sports car would be named the Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   Fry integrated the Southwest Conference in 1966 with Jerry
Levias, who as a sophomore made the winning plays in four games and
led the Ponies to the Cotton Bowl. This decision did not exactly
start a stampede to recruit black athletes, but suddenly the phrase
``social justice'' became popular among other coaches and athletic
directors. As a receiver and runner, the exciting Levias evoked
comparisons to Doak Walker himself.
</P>
<P>
   Texas teams had been famous for their aerial circuses, dating to
Sammy Baugh at TCU and Gerald Mann, the Little Red Arrow of SMU.
Later, the Mustangs kept the tradition alive with Fred Benners and
Don Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Fry who in 1967 unveiled the most unusual offense of
all, the Flea Circus, featuring a 5-4 quarterback named Ines
(pronounced EE-ness) Perez. He was quite a sight, Perez, so small
that part of his jersey number had to be tucked inside his pants.
Levias, at 5-7, was the game-breaker, and the fullback, Pinky
Clements, stood 5-9, maybe. Pinky's dad would become the governor
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While winning only three games, the '67 Mustangs upset the
eventual conference champions, the Texas Aggies, on national
television, and won the hearts of underdogs everywhere. Fry had
tried to build a better mousetrap by using real mice.
</P>
<P>
   They went to three bowls but had only three winning seasons
under Hayden, and he was fired after finishing 7-4 in 1972. He
swallowed his pride and moved to the outback, taking a small-time
program at North Texas State, beating with regularity teams its own
size and knocking off the occasional national power.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he went, Hayden brought a certain unguarded charm and
energy. A North Texas booster named Newton Rayzor introduced him to
the actor Dabney Coleman, and they became friends. In the movie, 9
to 5, Coleman ad-libbed a line: ``As my old coach, Hayden Fry, used
to say. ''
</P>
<P>
   A high school star at Odessa, a Texan to his toes, Fry easily
made the transition to America's breadbasket. His nature grew less
brash, and more settled, but he continued his pattern of taking
doormats and giving them a reason to roar. Iowa won three Big Ten
titles and three trips to the Rose Bowl. The '90s were not kind to
the Hawkeyes, but Fry leaves as the winningest coach in Iowa
history.
</P>
<P>
   When he started his run in 1962, the big-name coaches were
Royal, Bear Bryant, Woody Hayes, John McKay, Ara Parseghian, Duffy
Daugherty and Frank Broyles. Hayden Fry was an unlikely candidate
to stay on the job for 37 years, but he never put much stock in
being predictable. And now college football will be a little less
fun, a little less colorful.

<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Coach C. Vivian Stringer's return to the
bench Saturday after after her son's arrest last week was supposed
to be a respite from her family problems. The everyday rhythms of
practice and the Scarlet Knights' drive to unseat Connecticut in
the Big East and improve on last year's 22-10 breakthrough season
should have been a welcome distraction.
</P>
<P>
   But Stringer came back to a team having troubles of its own. The
starting center, Jennifer Clemente, is hospitalized and out
indefinitely with a blood clot in her lung. Another key front-line
player, Usha Gilmore, sustained a concussion against Texas last
week and has not practiced since. And point guard Tasha Pointer,
the Big East's freshman of the year last season, is losing playing
time because of a herniated disk in her back.
</P>
<P>
   A measure of relief came when the Scarlet Knights took the floor
Saturday in the Coca-Cola Classic at the Louis Brown Athletic
Center and wore down Buffalo, 70-47.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 11 Scarlet Knights (5-1) will play Arizona State, a
71-48 winner over Southwestern Louisiana earlier Saturday
afternoon, in the championship on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, the Scarlet Knights seem to be battling
forces beyond basketball. Asked whether she felt snake-bit,
Stringer said: ``You begin to wonder. What doesn't make me look in
other directions for the cure or the antibody for this is that
we're finding the cure within ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The antidote Saturday afternoon before a boisterous crowd of
1,675 was the sophomore center Tammy Sutton-Brown, starting in
place of Clemente. Sutton-Brown, a 6-foot-4-inch sophomore, scored
13 points and hauled in 7 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   `'I knew that my responsibility was to go in there and start,''
Sutton-Brown said, ``and start it off right.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Tomora Young also provided some remedy. Six weeks removed
from knee surgery to mend a torn patellar tendon, she poured in a
game-high 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers surged ahead by 18-2, but Buffalo's pesky defense pulled
the Bulls (4-1) to within 22-13 late in the first half, despite
shooting 17 percent. Then Sutton-Brown began to muscle her way
inside, scoring Rutgers' last 6 points in the first half to give
the Scarlet Knights a 28-14 lead, then Rutgers' first 5 points of
the second half to stretch the gap to 33-16. The Bulls went quietly
after that, although Stringer was still wearing a scowl when the
Scarlet Knights built the cushion to 20 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were missing things, people who may have been open,''
Stringer said. ``We just need to communicate more, but it wasn't
because we weren't making the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   What Stringer saw next to the Rutgers bench could not have
helped her mood. Pointer, who played 21 minutes and scored 5
points, spent most of the second half lying on the floor, having
her lower back massaged by a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Stringer missed the Scarlet Knights' 66-59 victory over Texas
last Tuesday to be with her son, David, a North Carolina State
football player. He was charged with misdemeanor assault and being
an accessory to the felony of larceny during an incident that left
a 21-year-old man dead from a gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
   She returned to practice on Wednesday. Stringer said she could
immerse herself into coaching again because ``basketball is
everything to me,'' she said. ``To that extent, I always delve into
it and I continue to.''
</P>
<P>
   As for her emotional state, Stringer said: ``I'd rather not
comment. You see me here. I'm working hard. My team and I are going
to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach said an early-season tournament gives the team a
chance to measure itself.
</P>
<P>
   It also gives Rutgers the unexpected necessity of trying
untested players such as Davalyn Cunningham, a freshman guard who
came through with 11 points on 4 of 6 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona State (2-0), an upset over the Scarlet Knights would
be a huge boost after a 10-17 record last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a great opportunity for us,'' Arizona State
Coach Charli Turner Thorne said. ``It's kind of a nothing-to-lose
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Arizona State received 16 points from Leaf Newman and
15 from Kitch Kitchen, and outrebounded Southwest Louisiana (0-4)
by 46-35.
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   CHARLI TURNER THORNE, Arizona State's coach, is due to deliver
her first child, a son, on Feb. 6, the same day the Sun Devils play
host to Washington in a Pacific-10 game. ``Hopefully he will not
decide to come on that day,'' Turner Thorne said. ``If I have a
long labor I still might get through the game.''

   NEW YORK _ Standing in front of the full-length mirror, the girl
fights back tears. Her thighs are too big, her breasts too small
and her nose bumpy. Or so this 16-year-old thinks, comparing
herself with ``Baywatch'' babes and Victoria's Secret models.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, boys never call, and getting undressed
for gym is a mortification. But such problems have quick fixes, the
magazine ads promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can look better, why not?'' the girl asked during a
recent consultation with a plastic surgeon. Her parents are living
proof, she argued, her mother rejuvenated by a face lift and her
father's brow smoothed of its furrows.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor was not persuaded. He said later that he had stalled
by scheduling another appointment, and that he hoped the Long
Island family did not look elsewhere in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's 40-something parents are part of a tide of affluent
baby boomers who are being tucked, peeled and augmented as never
before. But it is the teen-age girls now flocking to the suites of
plastic surgeons from Park Avenue to Beverly Hills who pose an
ethical problem for doctors who must decide whether to operate on
patients who are too young to vote, but old enough to feel social
pressures to be physically perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are capable of doing awful things to these kids,'' said Dr.
Mark Sultan, chief of plastic surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center
and one of two dozen doctors who said they are seeing more
teen-agers than ever before who are eager to change their looks and
willing to go through often painful surgery to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The surgeon's task, Sultan and others said, is to weed out
youngsters with true deformities from those responding to media
messages and peer or parental pressure. ``We have to decide what is
real, what is imagined and what is exaggerated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least 14,000 adolescents nationwide had cosmetic surgery in
1996, a slight increase from 1992, when the boom began, according
to data from the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons. In all age groups, 700,000 procedures were done last
year, up 70 percent in four years.
</P>
<P>
   But professionals agree that those numbers are a vast
understatement, perhaps by as much as half, since they do not
include the many procedures now done by dermatologists,
ophthalmologists, ear nose and throat specialists, dentists and
others.
</P>
<P>
   And the make-overs of choice are changing for teen-agers. A
generation ago, it was not unusual for youngsters to have their
noses straightened or ears pinned back, procedures that doctors say
are appropriate for those with ungainly features.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, more controversial procedures, like breast
augmentation, liposuction and tummy tucks, are gaining popularity
in this impressionable age group. In the New York area, these
procedures, among two dozen available, range in cost from $2,000
for liposuction to $5,000 for a tummy tuck.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, there were 5,519 nose jobs among teen-agers, 3,024 ear
operations, 978 breast implants, 472 liposuctions and no tummy
tucks. Four years later, nose jobs were down to 4,313 and ear
pinnings to 2,470. But breast augmentations were up to 1,172,
liposuctions increased to 788 and tummy tucks to 130. And many more
adolescents seeking these newer procedures were turned away by
doctors who say they rarely perform them in anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   Letting Them Wait Can Solve the Problem
</P>
<P>
   Stalling is a popular tactic among doctors, who count on the
fact that teen-agers are by definition mercurial.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Christopher Nanni, for one, set out to dissuade an
overweight girl from Bay Ridge who came to him recently after many
failed attempts at diet and exercise. She was 16 years old and 5
feet 3 inches tall, and weighed 185 pounds. Her mother, divorced
and struggling on a secretary's salary, was not enthusiastic about
either the costs or the risks of liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Nanni put the girl on a sensible diet and encouraged her mother
to buy a treadmill. Come back in a year or two, he told them. If
liposuction seemed appropriate then, he would do the procedure, at
a big discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of disappointed, but it made sense,'' the girl said
grudgingly, still preferring the quick fix to the ordeal of losing
weight.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother was thrilled. ``As a parent you want your children to
be happy, so I went along with it,'' she said, describing her
daughter's misery each time they went shopping or attended a big
family gathering. But when Nanni resisted, she was relieved. ``I
respect him immensely for not just taking my money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of new procedures can be a relief to
adolescents overwhelmed by an otherwise intractable physical
disfigurement. One New Jersey teen-ager, 5 feet 4 inches tall and
weighing 220 pounds, doggedly set out to lose 100 pounds,
succeeded, and kept the weight off for more than a year. Left
behind, however, was an apron of excess skin that brought her to
the office of Dr. Gerald Pitman, who had never before treated a
girl so young.
</P>
<P>
   Impressed by her resolve and her mother's silence during their
first meeting, signals that the girl was mature and self-motivated,
Pitman agreed to operate. When the girl was between the ages of 15
and 18, Pitman did a series of surgeries on her abdomen, thighs,
upper arms and breasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only did he make me look beautiful, he made me feel
beautiful,'' said the girl, who once wore men's size 38 jeans and
is now a sleek women's size 6. Like most of the youngsters
interviewed, she spoke on the condition, set by her parents, that
she not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey girl rarely looks at her ``before'' photos, when
she had fat rippling from her knees. But she still recalls being
``tortured'' by classmates, who called her names and shunned her
during games of spin the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would want to be with a fat disgusting girl who can't get
out of her own way?'' she said now, her hair pulled back to reveal
fine cheekbones.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Pressure From a Parent Must Be Eliminated
</P>
<P>
   All the doctors interviewed spoke of the need to distinguish a
child's wishes from a parent's, which often requires chasing the
adult from the examining room during the initial meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Baker, a surgeon in a suburb of Orlando, Fla., the
state that is second to California in the number of plastic surgery
procedures done each year, described one such consultation
recently. The mother announced that her daughter was miserable
about her nose. The girl sat silent, staring at the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you like your nose?'' the doctor asked the child.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother thinks it's too big.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then why don't we do your mother's nose?''
</P>
<P>
   He rejected the case.
</P>
<P>
   In extreme situations, doctors say, a child-abuse complaint is
filed against a parent who insists on a needless operation, since
no surgery is without medical risk.
</P>
<P>
   The general surge in cosmetic surgery has its roots in
demographics, medical technology and health-care economics. As baby
boomers hit 50, they are doing anything and everything to arrest
the ravages of age. Meanwhile, new procedures are invented and old
ones become safer and less stigmatized.
</P>
<P>
   And plastic surgeons, doing elective procedures not covered by
insurance, are aggressively marketing themselves: ``No Ifs, Ands or
Butts; You Can Change Your Bottom Line in Hours.'' Last year,
700,000 procedures were done in all age groups, a 70 percent
increase from 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge problem for the public,'' said Dr. Jane Petro,
a Westchester County plastic surgeon. ``There is enormous pressure
to do things the patient isn't going to be helped by, because
someone shows up with a check.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultation with a teen-age patient is a distinct art. It
generally involves repeat visits, over several months, to mitigate
impulsiveness. The negatives _ for example, scarring and loss of
sensation following breast enlargement _ are stressed. Sometimes
meetings with a therapist are required, especially when an eating
disorder is suspected.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors say they look for red flags in body language. Does
the child smile? Interact easily with the mother? Cringe after
disrobing? Does the patient's perception of the defect match the
evidence in the mirror? Has the youngster, or the parent, had
repeated plastic surgeries?
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be able to tell me what they don't like,'' Baker
said. ``And if the answer is `I'm just ugly,' that's not good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   At heart, the doctors are trying to determine whether the
youngster's complaint is a realistic cry for help, a frivolous
attempt at perfection or a symptom of a more serious psychological
problem.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old stooping from the weight of triple-cup breasts,
for instance, ``qualifies as a medical emergency,'' said Dr. George
Beraka, a Park Avenue surgeon. By contrast, a girl ``who hates her
nose one day and her ears the next,'' he said, ``maybe needs a
psychiatrist.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors disagree about whether they ought to function as
therapists as well as surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``With adolescents, their ideas about their bodies change as
fast as their bodies do,'' said Dr. Nicholas Perricone, a professor
of dermatology at Yale University. ``They are facing so many
issues, so many forces from the outside. We see more neuroses than
psychiatrists.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Brennan, a plastic surgeon from Newport Beach,
Calif., balks at what seems to him psychobabble. ``I'm not
suggesting you operate on every kid who walks in the door,'' he
said. ``But it's no different than orthodontia. We didn't do
psychotherapy before we straightened a teen-ager's teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Some surgeons regularly include psychologists or psychiatrists
in their consultations, to weed out patients with psychological
problems, like distorted body images. But even girls without
serious mental-health problems are often at war with their flesh in
many ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The body is a screen on which they project negative feelings
about themselves,'' said Dr. Ann Kearney-Cooke, a Cincinnati
psychologist and author of a curriculum to teach girls skills that
improve body image. ``If they don't know how to handle attention
from boys, they want a breast reduction. We need to spend time
teaching them to set boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Girls represent the majority of cases and the more ambiguous
ones. Boys usually want their ears pinned back or reduction of
enlarged breasts, a condition caused by hormone imbalance.
</P>
<P>
   The Problems Beyond Body Image
</P>
<P>
   Beyond body-image issues, some doctors say that refusing plastic
surgery for the young may toughen them for the stings and
disappointments that lie ahead. ``To teach them to deal with
adversity, they have to bump into some things in life,'' said Dr.
Susan Craig Scott, a plastic surgeon and mother of a teen-age girl.
``There is definitely something to be said for learning to deal
with the hand life gives you.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, sometimes with the passage of time a cosmetic-surgery
patient may realize that the desire for such drastic change was an
immature mistake. One young woman, for instance, went to Dr.
Richard Ellenbogen in Los Angeles a few years ago, when she was a
teen-ager, because she hated her crooked nose, she said. Before she
knew it, seduced by the glossy brochures in the waiting room, she
was on a self-improvement treadmill that included surgery on her
chin, ears and breasts, along with liposuction and hair extensions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just a few sobering years later, she sees it was a mistake
to ``get so caught up in it'' and said she would caution a daughter
to think twice. ``I'd want her not so set on her looks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they go along with the idea of surgery, many parents
try to caution children that it is not a panacea. One father in
Greenwich, Conn., reluctantly let his 10th-grade daughter get a
nose job before she left for boarding school. Even after the
surgery, he still asks himself whether the girl's unhappiness was a
``reflection of something deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did she want to change her nose, or did she want to be a
different person?'' he asked. ``I don't think we'll ever be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   He drummed his concern into the girl beforehand. ``He pounded it
into my head that I'd still be the same person,'' she said. ``If
you're a loser on the inside, you'll still be a loser on the
inside. I just thought I'd be happier, that it would make me feel
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And what has changed? ``I'm not thinking about how I look all
the time and looking in the mirror constantly,'' she said. ``But I
still have the same personality. I'm pretty much myself.''

 &HT;    New era starting with shuttle launch
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS, NASA GRAPHICS
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Thursday's launch of the space shuttle Endeavour
will mark the start of the next era in America's human spaceflight
program, the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   The first space station element is in orbit, launched Nov. 20
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on a Proton rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour's 12-day mission will be to mate the Unity connecting
module in its cargo bay with the Russian-built element, the Zarya
control module. Astronaut Nancy Currie, a former Troy resident,
will play a key role as the operator of the shuttle's robotic arm
which will grab Zarya and position it for docking with the Unity
module.
</P>
<P>
   The embryonic station will not be ready for occupancy, but it
will be powered up and tested, and U.S. and Russian astronauts will
enter it to set things up for future assembly flights. The third
element should be added in July, and the first station crew should
take up residence in January 2000.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the station is assembled _ sometime in the year
2004, according to the latest timetable _ the station will be the
largest, most complex human object put into space. It will cover an
area larger than a football field, weigh 460 tons and contain
46,000 cubic feet of volume _ as much as two Boeing 747 jumbo jets,
according to Boeing, which is also the main contractor for the
space station.
</P>
<P>
   NASA says the nation will open new doors to knowledge as
astronauts from the United States and other nations do research in
the station's barrel-shaped research modules. Its microgravity
environment _ the near total absence of gravity _ will allow
experiments that can't be done on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   It will also be the biggest and costliest space project ever
attempted, involving 16 nations and 43 rocket launches from the
U.S. and Russia. Cost estimates have soared from the original $8
billion pricetag in 1984 to a recent government estimate of nearly
$100 billion, including operating costs and resupply flights.
</P>
<P>
   After years of designing and redesigning the station, fighting
for funds and negotiating with 15 international partners, NASA
hopes the American public will start taking notice of the project
itself, rather than the funding debates that have drawn most of the
media attention so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're real excited about what's coming, and I'm hoping that
you all share our excitement,'' Frank Culbertson, space station
operations manager and a former astronaut, said to reporters this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Now that hardware is flying, the project is bound to attract
more attention.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has failed to ignite public enthusiasm the way the
Apollo moon-landing program did, the space station will involve
more flights, more space activity, and in many ways, more technical
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Just for starters, the space station can't be assembled and
tested on the ground. Several countries are responsible for the
production of various elements. Thirty-four U.S. shuttle flights
and nine Russian rocket launches will be required to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   Many more astronauts will be working in space. Seven assembly
crews and four space station ``expedition'' crews are in training,
said Bonnie Dunbar, crew director and former astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a three-person crew in January 2000, the station
will be continuously occupied for 10 years to 15 years, she said.
The station is designed to house up to seven astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   But the schedule is full of perils. Each element launched will
be critical to the rest of the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single one of them would have big impacts on the
program'' if it failed to work or didn't make it into orbit,
program manager Randy Brinkley said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's experience with its Mir space station has shown the
potential problems and dangers. Crews, including U.S. astronauts,
have had to repair broken steering, power and breathing systems,
sometimes with emergency spacewalks. In June 1997, a seven-ton
cargo ship accidentally sideswiped the station, damaging a solar
panel and puncturing one of Mir's pressurized modules.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, Mirs two-man Russian crew retreated into their
Soyuz landing capsule to ride out the Leonid meteor shower,
although no meteor strikes on the station were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the biggest issue isn't technical, but financial.
Brinkley said NASA won't know until next year whether the Russian
government will give its space agency the funding it needs to meet
its commitments for space station hardware and the rockets for its
share of assembly and supply flights.
</P>
<P>
   The most critical item Russia is to provide as a space station
partner is the Service Module, scheduled for launch in July. It's
needed to control the station's attitude and periodically reboost
its orbit to counter the slight but steady drag from the outer
fringes of Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   So critical is this piece that NASA has chipped in $60million _
in exchange for some research time and resources Russia would have
had on the station _ and made contingency plans to launch an
interim module and be ready to build its own replacement module.
Failure by Russia to deliver the Service Module could delay the
station's completion by a couple of years, Brinkley said. He
declined to estimate the cost to the United States of building a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial problems have added to the station's
financial woes. In June, the General Accounting Office, the
auditing arm of Congress, upped its cost estimate for the station
from $93.9 billion to nearly $95.6 billion, counting operating
costs and shuttle flights. Its report said the cost could well go
higher if the schedule slips further or more shuttle flights are
required.

BROWN REFLECTS ON SUCCESSFUL SEASON AT TEXAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   A record-setting season in the history books and a heaping
helping of Thanksgiving leftovers in his belly, Texas football
coach Mack Brown joined the tourists in celebrating a season-ending
upset of [ No. 6 ]Texas A&AMP;M. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown and his wife, Sally, took a celebratory drive by the UT
tower late Friday night to see the campus landmark awash in orange
lights. Normally, only the top portion is lit after victories. But
when the Longhorns win a conference championship or knock off the
Aggies, every inch glows orange, from the ground floor to the top
of the observatory deck. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As hard as these kids had worked to light that tower up, I
thought I should go down and pay tribute to it,'' said Brown, whose
team's 26-24 triumph over A&AMP;M allowed Texas to finish with an 8-3
record, doubling the Longhorns' victory total from 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As he drove by and watched fans pose for pictures, Brown said he
began to grasp the significance of what his initial Texas team had
accomplished: an NCAA career rushing record for tailback Ricky
Williams (6,279 yards), who will learn Dec. 12 if he wins the 1998
Heisman Trophy; 15 additional NCAA career records set or tied by
Williams; renewed enthusiasm in fans, .MDBU/with crowds of more
than 80,000 at Royal-Memorial Stadium [ who filled Royal-Memorial
Stadium with more than 80,000 fans ].MDBR/.MDNM/for each of the
team's last three home games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Brown could point to two victories over top-10
opponents: Friday's upset of A&AMP;M, ranked sixth in The Associated
Press poll, and a 20-16 triumph over then-No. 7 Nebraska that broke
the Cornhuskers' 47-game home winning streak Oct. 31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``No question, we got as much from this football team as we
could get, from the first day of spring practice right through the
A&AMP;M game,'' Brown said. ``It couldn't have been much better. It's
been a dream year for us.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The victories over A&AMP;M and Nebraska marked the first time since
1990 for Texas to defeat two top-10 foes in the same season. By
comparison, the Longhorns were a combined 1-8-1 against top-10
opponents in six seasons under Brown's predecessor, John Mackovic. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of Williams' myriad records, perhaps the most incredible is that
he surpassed Navy's Napoleon McCallum as the NCAA career leader in
all-purpose yards, with 7,206. Williams did so without ever
returning a kick in his college career. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before the A&AMP;M game, Williams lobbied Brown for the chance to
return a kickoff if it would help him accumulate the 234 yards he
needed to surpass McCallum. Brown laughed and urged him to
concentrate on getting the 63 rushing yards he needed to surpass
Tony Dorsett as the career rushing leader among Divison I-A
players. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You're not getting 234, bud. Their defense is too
good,''' Brown said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Williams finished with 259 rushing yards and 36 yards on
five pass receptions, he tapped Brown on the shoulder and said: ``I
guess I won't need that kickoff return, after all.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brown laughed as he recounted the exchange, using it as a
fitting summation for a player and team that exceeded expectations
throughout 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ricky did would have to be the best performance under
pressure I've ever seen by a great player against a great
defense,'' Brown said. ``It was a fitting end to a great year for
us.'' &QL;

POSTCARDS FROM THE LEDGE: FRANCHIONE KEEPS OPTION UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What I'd love to hear, what I think all of Fort Worth would love
to hear, from TCU coach Dennis Franchione is that he's not going
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ever. Never. No way. No how.
</P>
<P>
   We want him to tell us that he'll bleed purple till the day they
cart him away, singing the TCU fight song and flashing the Frog
sign on his way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   But the man's not stupid.
</P>
<P>
   If you've gotten the idea Franchione is keeping his options
open, while continually denying that he's had any contact from
anyone at Oklahoma, despite all the media rumors, you're right. He
is, as quietly and carefully as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that Franchione, fresh off a 6-5 season in
the first year of a six-year contract, is looking to put Fort Worth
in his rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Fort Worth a lot,'' Franchione says. ``I'm excited
about TCU and what we got accomplished the first year. I'm excited
about the future and the facilities. I'm kind of tired of this
being a media topic because it shouldn't be. It creates uncertainty
for fans and recruits and I don't seem to have any control over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, TCU athletic director Eric Hyman's policy in which he said
he would not ``confirm or deny'' whether he'd been contacted by OU,
asking for permission to talk to his head coach, and a couple of TV
interviews in which Franchione seemed to act ``honored'' to be
considered by OU aggravated rather than helped the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of took it lighthearted at first, so I may have come
across a little indecisive or open, and I didn't mean to do that,''
Franchione admitted. ``This has all been somewhat amusing to me
because nothing official has happened. I've had all kinds of media
overtures but nothing from anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione has shown, not surprisingly, that he knows what the
coaching game is all about. He knows that Oklahoma is the big time,
a step up in class from TCU (sorry, but it's true). He could win a
national title at OU. Look me in the eye and tell me he has a
realistic chance of doing that at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any coach goes into a situation thinking it's
not going to be a long-term thing,'' Franchione said. ``I never
have. But here's Mack Brown, he's at a great school in North
Carolina, and he leaves and goes to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would listen to what people have to say ...''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Fran, so keep your ears open. No one can blame you for that.
And if somebody wants you bad enough to pay off your reverse buyout
clause and you decide to leave, I suppose that's the way the game
works, as distasteful as it is to watch grown men break contracts
they expect the players they recruit to keep.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd like to believe, though, is that the guy who said, upon
his arrival, that he'd be happy if TCU was the last coaching stop
on his resume, plans on sticking around for at least a couple of
years. ...
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Randy Moss was in the Vikings' 46-36 victory
Thursday against the Cowboys at Texas Stadium, his postgame,
head-down, who-gives-a-flip appearance on Fox for the traditional
John Madden turkey leg presentation was equally unimpressive. In
the locker room later, when a newspaper reporter approached, Moss
shook his head. ``You're not TV,'' he said, declining to speak to
the pen-and-notebook crowd. Fine, Randy. Nice to see you. Hope you
freeze your earlobes off up there in Minnesota. ...
</P>
<P>
   And for those who keep crying about how the Cowboys passed on
taking Moss with the eighth pick in the draft, at least they have a
rational alibi (whether you buy it or not) in not choosing to mix
Moss' rapsheet with an organization frantic to clean up its image.
What about the other 18 teams who passed on him, too? What's their
excuse? ...
</P>
<P>
   Most prevalent feeling to emerge from the Cowboys' locker room
after the game was not a sigh of relief that they'd almost kept up
with the Vikings' offensive firestorm, despite a multitude of
injuries. Instead, the Cowboys were legitimately disappointed that
they'd put themselves in position to win the game in the third
quarter and let it get away again. ...
</P>
<P>
   Anybody doubt that cornerback will be high on the Cowboys' list
for next year's draft? Believe it or not, that fits in with coach
Chan Gailey's draft philosophy anyway. He may be the offensive
coordinator, but he believes in taking defensive linemen and
cornerbacks high in the draft. ...
</P>
<P>
   To the many who wrote or called to point out the inconsistency
of my position on Ken Caminiti's passing up lots more loot from
Detroit to return to Houston (Revo's Rimshots last week), all right
already. It was a cheap and easy rip, I took it and I regret it.
You're right, everyone of you. Caminiti did the right thing and
should be applauded for not making money the most important issue.
Case closed. ...
</P>
<P>
   And while we're getting the record straight, former Mavericks
operations director Marty Faulkner writes to say that he left the
organization to pursue another opportunity, not because of any
problems with president Terdema Ussery, as mentioned as a
possibility here, so apologies to both parties in that case, too.
...
</P>
<P>
   All-time NFL career TD man Jerry Rice, apparently ticked off
about catching just three passes (none in the first half) in the
49ers' ragged victory over New Orleans last week, hinted afterward
that he might consider retiring, then soft-shoed away when Bay Area
columnists pointed out that his attitude might be construed as a
bit selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he's just frustrated that the 49ers' offense hasn't
played like it can and should.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not playing that way, it's not fun, and if it's not
fun, I've got to think about retiring,'' Rice told reporters. ``I
talked to Michael Jordan, and he told me the same thing. He thought
about retirement because he was not having a good time.

   Jets wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson was asked about the death of

facility, officially named Weeb Ewbank Hall.

Randy Johnson to town or face the prospect of crawling back to

strike out on both, maybe Son of Sam's available.

BREWERS AND CLARK _ A PERFECT FIT? (For use by NYTimes News Service
clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Clark should sign with the Milwaukee Brewers. It would be
the perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers, having grown weary of John Jaha, need a first
baseman. Clark needs a team. Bud Selig could use some advice.
</P>
<P>
   Clark could run baseball by day and play first base by night,
providing both baseball and the Brewers with his invaluable
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, by mutual need, he will be back with the Rangers.
Both sides have few other options, especially if Rafael Palmeiro
returns to the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Clark would then have nowhere else to go. The best teams in
baseball are set at first base. After the Rangers, the best teams
looking for a first baseman are the Brewers and the Pittsburgh
Pirates. Kevin Young can play first base for Pittsburgh, but they
would like to move him to third.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would also have few other options at first base. One
would be a platoon of Lee Stevens and Mike Simms and sign a
front-line designated hitter like Jose Canseco or Rickey Henderson.
Another would be to sign Robin Ventura and move either him or Todd
Zeile to first base. But Rangers officials don't believe Ventura is
worth $7 to $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could trade for a first baseman. Kansas City would like
to move Jeff King, but again a trade would mean giving up valuable
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   But getting Clark back would be the path of least resistance,
providing the Rangers don't try to low ball him. Or his attorney,
Jeff Moorad, doesn't try to point out the obvious _ that Clark is
much more deserving of $26 million than Jose Offerman.
Random observations
Baseball has some umpiring problems _ as a national magazine
proclaimed during the playoffs _ particularly with an inconsistent
strike zone. But their umpires are absolutely infallible when
compared to NFL officials, who absolutely stink. The most
incompetent people in all of sports are those zebras whose job it
is to call pass interference or not. They have absolutely no clue.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn obviously gives the Angels a dangerous bat in their
lineup. But perhaps more important, he gives the Angels their own
``sheriff,'' a hard-nosed leader who will reinforce manager Terry
Collins intense, aggressive approach to the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox, having been badly used by Bernie Williams
and his agent Scott Boras, have messed up royally. They've lost
Vaughn, missed out on Albert Belle and Williams, and are left with
nothing but Jose Offerman and his absurd contract. They have one
great player in Nomar Garciaparra and one great pitcher in Pedro
Martinez. The rest of the team is thoroughly mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   An all-Cy Young rotation is available for any team willing to
spend the money: Randy Johnson, Doug Drabek, Dennis Eckersley, Jack
McDowell and Orel Hershiser. It's a marketing executive's dream. Or
how about five left-handers available who have all had an 18-win
season: Steve Avery, Jim Abbott, Jimmy Key, Mark Langston and Pete
Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an interesting thought: Belle and Cal Ripken Jr. on the
same team.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin and his family spent
Thanksgiving week skiing in Canada. They were joined by Cardinals
general manager Walt Jocketty, Blue Jays GM Gord Ash and their
families. Asked if Ash is trying to move Clemens, Melvin said that
``he hasn't made up his mind yet. I think they may wait until July
to see if they're in contention.'' The Diamondbacks are totally
convinced they're going to get Johnson. But Johnson may eventually
be swayed by the Angels after they signed Vaughn and the
Diamondbacks failed to get Bernie Williams.]
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers eventually must throw some money at a left-handed
reliever: Mark Guthrie, Mike Magnante, Mike Munoz or Jim Poole.
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate the power of the Yankees to throw a dollar
at anybody they deem necessary. They're talking about a payroll of
$85 million next year and don't doubt one thing: They'll have no
trouble affording it.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos had a payroll of just over $8 million last
year. Now there are 25 players in the major leagues with an average
annual salary of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't appear as if the Indians will get the No. 1 starter
they were hoping to get, after they failed to interest Kevin Brown.
With an All-Star at every position, it's the one thing that
franchise is missing, but there is still hope Jaret Wright or
Bartolo Colon could develop into one.
</P>
<P>
   Why should owners in Montreal, Oakland, Kansas City and
Minnesota even try. Just throw a team out there for $10 million,
collecting your share of the national television contract and
everything else is pure profit. You have no chance anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Stunning development: The Toronto Blue Jays have negotiated a
new lease with SkyDome, rather than making good on their threat to
play in Exhibition Stadium next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are faced with one sad truth: They're stuck paying
Randy Myers $12 million over the next two years.

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Terry Baker sometimes feels as if he won an
Academy Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's actually a pretty good description of it,'' says the
former Oregon State quarterback. ``The only difference is, the
Heisman is more exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, they give out a lot of those \RAcademy Awards\S,
but they only award one Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker won it in 1962, providing a couple of historical
footnotes. Among other things: He is the last Heisman winner to
have begun his career as a single-wing tailback, although the
Beavers switched to the Wing-T prior to his junior year. And, he is
most assuredly the only Oregon State player who has even come
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we had a pretty good year in '62,'' says Baker, whose
99-yard run in the Liberty Bowl provided a 6-0 victory against
Villanova and capped a 9-2 season. ``And we also had a publicity
machine. Nothing like what they do today, but our guy on campus was
pushing me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also had a coach, Tommy Prothro, who guided the Beavers into
the limelight with two Rose Bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief pro career, Baker went back to school and got a
law degree at Southern Cal. For the past 28 years, he has been a
partner in a Portland law firm that he helped start.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to that, in 1970, he served on the President's Commission
on Campus Unrest and Kent State Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right after the bombings in Cambodia and the killings
at Kent State,'' he says. ``A very volatile era, and we spent a
year traveling around the country studying an issue that was having
a major impact on American society. It was a very useful
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, however, few who have met the state's only
Heisman winner have asked about campus unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you win that award,'' he says, laughing, ``it's almost as
if it becomes a part of your body. Everybody knows your name, and
it probably has opened a few doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, I once briefly considered running for governor, but
fortunately my political period passed fairly quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   No one at Oregon State has worn Baker's No. 11 jersey since he
left, but it wasn't officially retired until last week _ during the
Beavers' stunning upset of Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   So, does he still follow those battling Beavers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he says, ``you know that game last week where we beat
Oregon? It was the greatest football game I've ever seen in my
life.''

`IT WAS AN EVEN GREATER THRILL THE SECOND TIME'

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As the 1975 season approached, Ohio State
running back Archie Griffin found himself in a severe quandry.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the '74 campaign had been a pretty good one for
Griffin. In fact, he won the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through pre-season drills, I could only think of one
thing,'' he recalls, ``and that was what Woody Hayes always said:
every day, you either get better, or you get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that settled it. Griffin was left with no choice ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what I was bringing down on myself,'' he says,
``but I actually played that whole season hoping I would win a
second Heisman. Toward the end, I realized what a ridiculous notion
that was, and I was convinced they would never give it to the same
guy twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Proving that Griffin _ now an associate AD at his alma mater _
was a better football player than prophet. In '75, he became the
only man in the 63-year history of the award to win it twice.
</P>
<P>
   Was he maybe a bit blase by then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Lord no,'' he says. ``It was an even greater thrill the
second time. When they give you that award they call you the
greatest player in America, and it's just such an honor ... it's a
humbling moment. It was a high point in my life, and it's something
that everybody identifies you with from then on.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thing you have to remember is that I played on one of
the most powerful teams in history. We had a lot of great players,
and without them _ my teammates _ I would have never won anything.
And that's the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin also says he ``loved playing for Woody Hayes,'' but does
have one regret _ a Rose Bowl loss to a UCLA team the Buckeyes had
beaten by three touchdowns early in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most disappointing loss I ever had,'' he says.
``They were a fine team, but I think we may have taken that game
for granted because we had beaten them earlier. I think we may have
gotten distracted by Hollywood and Disneyland _ that'll happen to
guys from the Midwest out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, in any case, was fated to play for the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he says, ``I was born in the hospital right here on
campus. I grew up here, played here, and then went just a little
ways up the road to Cincinnati when I was in the NFL. I've been
back here since '84, and now I oversee 17 of our 34 sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the best thing of all is, we finally beat Michigan this
year.''

FIRST HEISMAN WINNER HAD NO IDEA AWARD WOULD BECOME A HOLY GRAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When Jay Berwanger received the news that he
won the first Heisman Trophy, he was, of course, thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``A letter came to my fraternity house at the University of
Chicago, telling me I had won this award,'' he recalled. ``Enclosed
with the letter were two plane tickets, for me and my coach to fly
to New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the biggest thrill of my life. I had never been on an
airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Jay ... how was the flight?
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderful,'' he said. ``We took off, and after a while, we
landed. That's what I call a good flight.''
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1935, and that flight would carry Berwanger into
the pages of history as the first recipient of a then-obscure award
that would one day become the Holy Grail of college football. This
year's edition will be awarded by the Downtown Athletic Club in New
York on Dec. 12. Texas' Ricky Williams is the leading candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Berwanger's flight took him to an award he had never heard of.
But he knew about the silver football.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the award you got from the /Chicago Tribune'' if you
were named the player of the year in the Big Ten,'' said Berwanger,
84. ``It was a very coveted award, and they gave you a trophy with
a big silver football on it. The really big thrill for me that year
was winning that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning that placed him in the company of players such as Harold
``Red'' Grange of Illinois and Francis ``Pug'' Lund, the acclaimed
Minnesota running back whom Berwanger had faced during the previous
season.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the Heisman got Berwanger and his coach, Clark
Shaughnessy, ``a very nice dinner with about 400 to 500 people, and
a swell tour of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly, but at the time, I had no
idea about what this award would become.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What it has meant to me is, all my life, I've had people
coming up to me and asking for my autograph,'' he added. ``It's
kind of amazing _ they still do it, after all this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I've gotten out of it is that ... I kind of
joined a fraternity. I enjoy going back to New York for the
ceremony ... I think most of us do. We get together and tell lies,
and we all get better every year. It's been a lot of fun, a very
enjoyable part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The award was also an occasion of remarkable irony; within five
years, the school that produced history's first Heisman winner
would disappear forever from the landscape of major-college
football.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1930s, the once-powerful Maroons were marching
resolutely toward oblivion. Berwanger _ a classic triple-threat
tailback in the single-wing era _ was the school's last
All-American. The team's final Big Ten victory came in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Depression, the school dropped its football
program after the 1939 season. It was resurrected 30 years later,
at the Division III level.
</P>
<P>
   When Berwanger arrived as a freshman in 1932, the coach was Amos
Alonzo Stagg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his last year there,'' Berwanger said. ``He was a fine
person, and a great coach. His teams had legendary battles with
Fielding Yost's teams at Michigan, and he was winning championships
when Knute Rockne was a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, when I was there, I think Chicago had still won more
Big Ten titles than any other school. But they hadn't won one in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   They won none during Berwanger's career, either, finishing at
.500 (3-3-2, 4-4, 4-4) during each of his three years (1933-35) on
the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we were in the middle of the Depression then,''
Berwanger said, ``and that had a lot to do with what happened to
the school, and with my career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Dubuque, Iowa, and I normally would have tried to
go East to school, because I had high grades. But there was no
money to send me away that far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago wasn't far away, and there was a guy in my hometown
named Ira Davenport who had been an Olympian from the school in
1912. He had played for Stagg, and offered to take me up for an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stagg was a wonderful man, and one thing that I noticed was
that his players had great respect for him. Ira loved cigars, and
he also smoked a pipe, but not around Stagg, because the old man
wouldn't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Berwanger, described in news accounts of the day as ``Chicago's
one-man gang,'' was a runner-passer-kicker who finished with 22
career touchdowns, 1,839 yards divided almost equally between
running and throwing, and a 38-yard punting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the first real notice I got came from playing
defense when we held Minnesota to six points in the first half in
'34. They rolled us under in the second half, but Walter Camp put
me on his All-America team after watching that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those days, I played defense, did all the passing and
punting, and a lot of the running. In my senior year, I also had to
call the signals, because right before the season, our quarterback
got married and quit school.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the season highlights was a 20-13 loss to a powerful Ohio
State team, coached by Francis ``Landslide'' Schmidt. The week
before, the Buckeyes had been upset, 18-13, by Notre Dame in what
remains one of history's most famous games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were actually a bunch of really good guys, and we had a
good game with them,'' Berwanger said. ``I had an 85-yard run, but
it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As a reward for an outstanding season and career, Berwanger
received national acclaim, the silver football _ and another
now-famous trophy of which he remains slightly skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I know it's documented that they used some players in
New York to pose for that trophy,'' he said, ``but I've always
thought it looks a lot like a picture of me that ran in the Dubuque
paper one time. But I've never pushed it.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other rewards as well, but a fat pro contract was not
among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, the pros didn't make much money,'' he says. ``It
was a big deal if somebody got $5,000, and most guys were playing
for a few hundred bucks for a season _ or on a per-game basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it wasn't too bad in comparison to everything else
during the Depression. Someone figured out one time that for the
people in my graduating class who went into the business world, the
average starting salary was $17 a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that happened was that all of us who made
All-America went out to Hollywood and made a movie. Then I went
back to the school and coached the freshmen, and I also wrote a
column for the Chicago Daily News. I finally went to work for a
sponge rubber manufacturer.''
</P>
<P>
   Berwanger became acquainted with the Fort Worth-Dallas area
during the war, most of which he spent as a flight instructor at
the naval air station in Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got out, I discovered that they had sold the company I
was working for,'' he said, ``so I started my own _ Jay Berwanger
Inc. I still own it, but you could say that right now my position
in the firm is, I'm in charge of golf. Actually, we're in the
process of selling it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for being the first man ever to win the now-famous Heisman,
he says well, it's been nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it really didn't get to be such a big deal until
television came along,'' he says. ``After that, it kinda took
off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the massive hype that now surrounds the award he won 63
years ago, Berwanger manages a loud chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There sure is a lot of it, and they find new ways to do it
every year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no matter how thin you slice it, it's still baloney.''

McDowell and Orel Hershiser. It's a marketing executive's dream. Or
how about five left-handers available who have all had an 18-win
season: Steve Avery, Jim Abbott, Jimmy Key, Mark Langston and Pete
Schourek.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an interesting thought: Belle and Cal Ripken Jr. on the
same team.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers general manager Doug Melvin and his family spent
Thanksgiving week skiing in Canada. They were joined by Cardinals
general manager Walt Jocketty, Blue Jays GM Gord Ash and their
families. Asked if Ash is trying to move Clemens, Melvin said that
``he hasn't made up his mind yet. I think they may wait until July
to see if they're in contention.'' The Diamondbacks are totally
convinced they're going to get Johnson. But Johnson may eventually
be swayed by the Angels after they signed Vaughn and the
Diamondbacks failed to get Bernie Williams.]
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers eventually must throw some money at a left-handed
reliever: Mark Guthrie, Mike Magnante, Mike Munoz or Jim Poole.
</P>
<P>
   Never underestimate the power of the Yankees to throw a dollar
at anybody they deem necessary. They're talking about a payroll of
$85 million next year and don't doubt one thing: They'll have no
trouble affording it.
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos had a payroll of just over $8 million last
year. Now there are 25 players in the major leagues with an average
annual salary of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't appear as if the Indians will get the No. 1 starter
they were hoping to get, after they failed to interest Kevin Brown.
With an All-Star at every position, it's the one thing that
franchise is missing, but there is still hope Jaret Wright or
Bartolo Colon could develop into one.
</P>
<P>
   Why should owners in Montreal, Oakland, Kansas City and
Minnesota even try. Just throw a team out there for $10 million,
collecting your share of the national television contract and
everything else is pure profit. You have no chance anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Stunning development: The Toronto Blue Jays have negotiated a
new lease with SkyDome, rather than making good on their threat to
play in Exhibition Stadium next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are faced with one sad truth: They're stuck paying
Randy Myers $12 million over the next two years.

`IT STAMPS YOU AS THE BEST'

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Following a distinguished career with the
Dallas Cowboys, Roger Staubach received perhaps the ultimate
reward: induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But when the man who directed the Cowboys to two Super Bowl
titles throws a party, the guests usually arrive with something
else in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot of entertaining at home,'' he says. ``Almost
invariably, the first question people ask is, `Do you have your
Heisman Trophy here? Can we see it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   For Staubach, who won the award as a junior at Navy in 1963, it
has become something akin to a lifelong friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The effect it has on people is unprecedented,'' he says.
``It's by far the most recognized award any football player can
ever receive. Rightly or wrongly, it stamps you as the best _ and
that's the way people view you for the rest of your life.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the event unfolded 35 years ago, Staubach was not
completely thrilled by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great team,'' he says, ``but it was because of a lot
of people, not just me. Even back then, there was a lot of
publicity surrounding it, and Navy was definitely pushing me for
the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty much a quiet type of person, and I really just
wanted to do my part and kind of fade into the background. All the
hype was kind of embarrassing to me then.''
</P>
<P>
   Staubach was the fifth _ and last _ player from Army or Navy to
win the award, as the two schools reached the end of a long reign
as national powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat Michigan in Ann Arbor, and we were the last Navy team
to beat Notre Dame,'' he says. ``Our nemesis was the Cotton Bowl,
where we lost twice _ to SMU in the regular season and Texas in the
bowl game. It was a good year.''
</P>
<P>
   Now president of his own company, Staubach has adjusted to fame,
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's such a great honor,'' he says, ``and even back then,
I was excited by it, especially because my parents got to go to New
York for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that over the years the Heisman has transcended all
criticism, and it has brought nothing but good things to most of
those who won it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it seems the Heisman can even transcend one of
football's most ancient rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every so often,'' Staubach says, laughing, ``We even have
reunions of the guys who won it from Army and Navy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ As the 1957 season reached its conclusion,
Texas A&AMP;M coach Paul ``Bear'' Bryant made a brief address to the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't give the Heisman Trophy to John David Crow,'' he
rasped, ``They oughta just quit giving out the danged thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus spoke the Bear. And presto, Harry and Velma Crow of
Springhill, La., were taking the first plane ride of their lives _
all the way to New York with their baby boy for the award
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess a lot of people have heard that story,'' Crow says,
laughing. ``Coach Bryant didn't compliment anyone all that often,
so I guess it started people thinking, `This guy must really be
good.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I probably wouldn't have won the Heisman if he hadn't
said that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chances are that Crow _ a dramatically physical two-way player
winding up an outstanding career _ would have won it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Often compared to Bronco Nagurski, he did not make many
swivel-hipped runs _ but within 10 yards of either goal line, he
was the player who usually determined whether or not somebody
scored a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   His performance earned him a coveted award that he was unaware
of as a college senior ... and has thoroughly enjoyed ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea what it was,'' he says, ``until one day our
publicist, Jones Ramsey, called me into his office and started
asking me questions for a bio, like what was my favorite movie
star. I remember I told him it was Debbie Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the wall was a photo of a trophy, and I said, `That's real
nice-looking, what is it?' And he told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't long after that that Carolyn \Rhis wife\S and I were
on our way to New York for the ceremony. My folks went with us _
their first plane ride _ and it was really neat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carolyn and I are still making that trip, each year. It's been
a wonderful part of our lives. It's kind of like you joined a
fraternity, and you have this great group of friends to go visit
with every so often.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the award itself, it's almost as if it becomes a part
of your name. For the rest of your life, wherever you go, it goes
with you. It has brought me continuing recognition I never would
have dreamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   Crow, who rushed for 5,000 yards and had over 3,500 yards in
pass receptions in an 11-year NFL career, does have one gripe,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It upsets me when people run some of these guys down because
they never had big NFL careers,'' he says. ``The Heisman has
nothing to do with pro football. It's a reward for what you
achieved in college, and that's all.''

PALMEIRO MAKES PITCH TO RETURN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rafael Palmeiro understands that the Rangers
need pitching. He also understands why they have made Randy Johnson
their No. 1 priority.
</P>
<P>
   He just points out one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way that I see it, if they were to get Randy Johnson and
myself, with the team they already have in place, it would be a
very strong team,'' Palmeiro said. ``They could take two big steps
toward making it a championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro said yesterday his first choice still is to return to
the Baltimore Orioles, and he said the two sides are close to
working out a new five-year contract. But Palmeiro makes his home
in Colleyville and still is tantalized by the possibility of
returning to the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live 15 minutes from The Ballpark,'' Palmeiro said. ``It
would be nice to play there. But I've enjoyed Baltimore also. If I
can work something out with Baltimore, that would be great. If I
had the opportunity to come back to Texas, that would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' plan is to see if Johnson will accept their
four-year, $50 million offer. Johnson's agent Barry Meister said
yesterday he has received the final offers from the Rangers,
Anaheim Angels, Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona Diamondbacks. All
of them are for four years and approximately $50-51 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meister said Johnson and his wife, Lisa, will spend today going
through the offers and likely will announce their decision
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rangers have been very gracious,'' Meister said. ``They
understand Randy and Lisa just need to sit down and decide between
the three cities and four clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching and shortstop Royce Clayton have been the Rangers' top
priorities this off-season, but they are also without an everyday
first baseman under contract since Will Clark is a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin has spoken with Palmeiro's agent, Jim Bronner, but has
not made an offer. He also plans to talk with Clark's attorney,
Jeff Moorad, again this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hopeful they would be interested,'' Palmeiro said. ``At
this point, I've got to do what I've got to do. At this point, I'm
moving forward with the Orioles.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who has also received interest from the Boston Red
Sox, hit .296 with 43 homers and 121 runs batted in for the Orioles
this past season, winning the Silver Slugger award for best
offensive first baseman. Clark hit .305 with 23 homers and 102 RBI,
helping the Rangers win their second division title in three
seasons.

IT HURTS, BUT FRANCHIONE'S RIGHT FOR KEEPING OPTIONS OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ What I'd love to hear, what I think all of
Fort Worth would love to hear, from TCU coach Dennis Franchione is
that he's not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Ever. Never. No way. No how.
</P>
<P>
   We want him to tell us that he'll bleed purple till the day they
cart him away, singing the TCU fight song and flashing the Frog
sign on his way out the door.
</P>
<P>
   But the man's not stupid.
</P>
<P>
   If you've gotten the idea Franchione is keeping his options
open, while continually denying that he's had any contact from
anyone at Oklahoma, despite all the media rumors, you're right. He
is, as quietly and carefully as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that Franchione, fresh off a 6-5 season in
the first year of a six-year contract, is looking to put Fort Worth
in his rearview mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Fort Worth a lot,'' Franchione says. ``I'm excited
about TCU and what we got accomplished the first year. I'm excited
about the future and the facilities. I'm kind of tired of this
being a media topic because it shouldn't be. It creates uncertainty
for fans and recruits and I don't seem to have any control over
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, TCU athletic director Eric Hyman's policy in which he said
he would not ``confirm or deny'' whether he'd been contacted by OU,
asking for permission to talk to his head coach, and a couple of TV
interviews in which Franchione seemed to act ``honored'' to be
considered by OU aggravated rather than helped the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of took it lighthearted at first, so I may have come
across a little indecisive or open, and I didn't mean to do that,''
Franchione admitted. ``This has all been somewhat amusing to me
because nothing official has happened. I've had all kinds of media
overtures but nothing from anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione has shown, not surprisingly, that he knows what the
coaching game is all about. He knows that Oklahoma is the big time,
a step up in class from TCU (sorry, but it's true). He could win a
national title at OU. Look me in the eye and tell me he has a
realistic chance of doing that at TCU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any coach goes into a situation thinking it's
not going to be a long-term thing,'' Franchione said. ``I never
have. But here's Mack Brown, he's at a great school in North
Carolina, and he leaves and goes to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would listen to what people have to say ...''
</P>
<P>
   OK, Fran, so keep your ears open. No one can blame you for that.
And if somebody wants you bad enough to pay off your reverse buyout
clause and you decide to leave, I suppose that's the way the game
works, as distasteful as it is to watch grown men break contracts
they expect the players they recruit to keep.
</P>
<P>
   What I'd like to believe, though, is that the guy who said, upon
his arrival, that he'd be happy if TCU was the last coaching stop
on his resume, plans on sticking around for at least a couple of
years. ...
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as Randy Moss was in the Vikings' 46-36 victory
Thursday against the Cowboys at Texas Stadium, his postgame,
head-down, who-gives-a-flip appearance on Fox for the traditional
John Madden turkey leg presentation was equally unimpressive. In
the locker room later, when a newspaper reporter approached, Moss
shook his head. ``You're not TV,'' he said, declining to speak to
the pen-and-notebook crowd. Fine, Randy. Nice to see you. Hope you
freeze your earlobes off up there in Minnesota. ...
</P>
<P>
   And for those who keep crying about how the Cowboys passed on
taking Moss with the eighth pick in the draft, at least they have a
rational alibi (whether you buy it or not) in not choosing to mix
Moss' rapsheet with an organization frantic to clean up its image.
What about the other 18 teams who passed on him, too? What's their
excuse? ...
</P>
<P>
   Most prevalent feeling to emerge from the Cowboys' locker room
after the game was not a sigh of relief that they'd almost kept up
with the Vikings' offensive firestorm, despite a multitude of
injuries. Instead, the Cowboys were legitimately disappointed that
they'd put themselves in position to win the game in the third
quarter and let it get away again. ...
</P>
<P>
   Anybody doubt that cornerback will be high on the Cowboys' list
for next year's draft? Believe it or not, that fits in with coach
Chan Gailey's draft philosophy anyway. He may be the offensive
coordinator, but he believes in taking defensive linemen and
cornerbacks high in the draft. ...
</P>
<P>
   To the many who wrote or called to point out the inconsistency
of my position on Ken Caminiti's passing up lots more loot from
Detroit to return to Houston (Revo's Rimshots last week), all right
already. It was a cheap and easy rip, I took it and I regret it.
You're right, everyone of you. Caminiti did the right thing and
should be applauded for not making money the most important issue.
Case closed. ...
</P>
<P>
   And while we're getting the record straight, former Mavericks
operations director Marty Faulkner writes to say that he left the
organization to pursue another opportunity, not because of any
problems with president Terdema Ussery, as mentioned as a
possibility here, so apologies to both parties in that case, too.
...
</P>
<P>
   All-time NFL career TD man Jerry Rice, apparently ticked off
about catching just three passes (none in the first half) in the
49ers' ragged victory over New Orleans last week, hinted afterward
that he might consider retiring, then soft-shoed away when Bay Area
columnists pointed out that his attitude might be construed as a
bit selfish.
</P>
<P>
   Rice said he's just frustrated that the 49ers' offense hasn't
played like it can and should.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're not playing that way, it's not fun, and if it's not
fun, I've got to think about retiring,'' Rice told reporters. ``I
talked to Michael Jordan, and he told me the same thing. He thought
about retirement because he was not having a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'm saying, guys, is if this drags on for a while, you
would have to consider that, think about it, if you're not having a
good time.'' Yeah, that's always been the No. 1 criteria about
keeping a job for me, too. Right. ...
</P>
<P>
   The ``Chicago Tribune's'' Bernie Lincicome said it best as he
bemoaned not being able to watch the Bulls' Dennis Rodman play
regularly: ``A day without Dennis is like an overpass without
graffiti.''

SINCE SOPHOMORE YEAR, BROWNWOOD STAR A HOT PROSPECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK HERRIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNWOOD, Texas _ Sitting in the office of Tom Osborne,
Nebraska's legendary former coach, Colby Freeman's eyes widened.
</P>
<P>
   The glass-enclosed case with national championship trophies. The
coach. The conversation.
</P>
<P>
   That was Freeman's star-struck initiation into college
recruiting. That was two summers ago, when Freeman was Brownwood
High School's quarterback preparing for his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that Nebraska summer camp that Freeman became such a
commodity that Osborne tried to talk him into a Cornhuskers career.
By the end of the week, Freeman was offered a scholarship by a team
that was one year removed from consecutive national championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my first contact with any type of college,'' said
Freeman, the son of Class 4A Brownwood coach Steve Freeman. ``With
not even knowing about Nebraska and having never met the coaches,
and by the end of the week they offered a scholarship. What they
told me was that I had acquired the skills they were trying to
teach their guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons later, Freeman (6-foot-3, 205 pounds) is one of the
nation's most coveted quarterback recruits.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Freeman special is his combination of running and
throwing ability with size and speed (4.48 40-yard dash). He is the
state's top quarterback recruit and is ranked among the top 10
quarterbacks in the nation by several recruiting services.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one unique factor is his rushing capability,'' said
Steve Freeman, who played linebacker at Abilene Christian
University. ``He's had the ability to run the wishbone and any form
of option. And throwing schools like the fact of his mobility.''
</P>
<P>
   Colby Freeman said he has narrowed his wish list _ in no
specific order _ to Texas, Texas A&AMP;M and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've kind of officially said that's where the visits are going
to be,'' Freeman said in his polite Texas drawl.
</P>
<P>
   He did say that A&AMP;M is his leading choice and that it would be
hard to leave the state for Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   ``A&AMP;M is in the lead right now because of the comfort reason,''
Freeman said. ``I have been around them quite a bit more. And
thinking about the actual day I get in the car and drive up there
\Rto Nebraska\S, and not having my dad see me play, I don't know if
I want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   As a four-year starter, Freeman has become almost as well known
throughout Texas as former Brownwood coach Gordon Wood. The
Freemans helped turn Brownwood's proud program into a winner again.
With Colby Freeman at quarterback, the Lions went from 1-8-1 his
freshman season to three consecutive 10-win seasons and two
district championships. Brownwood finished this season 10-2 and
reached the second round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman showed his versatility by finishing this regular season
as the Fort Worth area's top Class 4A rusher (1,498 yards) and one
of its most accurate passers (58 for 98 and one interception). It
was the second consecutive season Freeman surpassed 1,000 yards
rushing and passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they \RNebraska\S could tell about Colby was that
he was a good-sized player and has good speed,'' said Bobby Burton,
managing editor of the ``National Recruiting Advisor''. ``Those are
two things you can't lose, barring injury. And he is dedicated to
becoming a great player.''

BROWN GETS HEAD START ON REAPING TALENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MILLER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mack Brown can finally return to his style
of recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   When he took over as the Texas Longhorns' football coach last
December, Brown found himself playing catchup in the recruiting
game. He was two months from national signing day with no recruits.
During a frenzied eight weeks, Brown signed a class of 18 recruits
that was competitive with any in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That was not how Brown did things in his last years at North
Carolina and that's not the way he's doing things in his first full
recruiting season with the Longhorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know that you have a group of young men who fill
certain needs for you, then you also know what positions you need
to get commitments for,'' Brown said. ``In my early days, we would
be in a position where we were waiting on five players until the
very end, and if the five went somewhere else, then in a sense, we
lost five scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of such national powers as Penn State,
Michigan and Ohio State, Brown has made Texas the first Big 12
school in the state to seek oral commitments from high school
players before their senior season.
</P>
<P>
   Commitments aren't binding until national signing day, Feb. 3,
the first day letters of intent for scholarship agreements can be
signed.
</P>
<P>
   As of Thanksgiving, Texas easily leads Texas A&AMP;M, Baylor and
Texas Tech _ the other Big 12 schools in the state _ with 17 oral
commitments from Texas high school players and one from Denver.
Four players have committed to play for the Aggies, three to Baylor
and one to Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is no question that they have some blue-chip
players committed to play for them next season,'' Bobby Burton,
editor-in-chief of ``The National Recruiting Advisor'', said of
Texas. ``I think that if everything holds their course, they have
the definite makings of a very strong class.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, Texas A&AMP;M and Texas Tech choose to wait to make their
big recruiting push, as Texas did before Brown arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many good players in the state of Texas, we just
feel like it is in our best interest to sit back and evaluate the
kids during their senior year,'' Baylor coach Dave Roberts said.
``It \Rwhat Texas is doing\S certainly won't affect what we do.
They have taken some players out of the pool, but there are still
plenty of good players available.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes agreed, even seeing benefits for
the Red Raiders by having Texas pick up early commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing you can do in a recruiting battle is finish
second,'' Dykes said. ``Now we know the people \Rwho\S have
committed to Texas. They are guys who probably would have anyway.
That saves us a lot of time. The sooner you find out that you're
not going to get a player, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   Waiting also eliminates some of the risks associated with early
recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   A player who is offered a scholarship and makes a commitment to
a school could suffer a career-ending injury during his final high
school season. Then there is the problem of players who change
their minds. On several occasions, a recruit has committed to
several schools before finally signing with one.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly why Texas A&AMP;M prefers a more conservative
approach to early commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a good situation if that player is truly committed
to the university,'' said Tim Cassidy, associate athletic director
in charge of football operations for Texas A&AMP;M. ``If it is someone
\Rwho\S has reservations, then we don't want him to commit until he
is sure. We tell them that it is like being engaged. Once you get
engaged, you can't go out on two or three more dates to make sure
it's what you really want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown started going after recruits early four years ago while at
North Carolina. It is the same style first-year TCU coach Dennis
Franchione brought to the Horned Frogs from New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just two different schools of thought on recruiting,''
Burton said. ``Florida State does not really go after the early
commitments, yet they have been very successful. Michigan, on the
other hand, goes after early commitments and they have also been
very successful. Who is to say which way is better than the
other?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has been successful at signing the players who make
commitments. Only one of his North Carolina recruits who committed
early did not sign. That case had the unusual circumstances of a
death in the family shortly before national signing day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very surprised if any of the kids \Rwho\S have told
us they are going to sign with us don't do so on signing day,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown started reeling in commitments in June when Texas held a
football camp for upcoming seniors. At the end of the camp, on June
3, Coppell High School offensive lineman Robbie Doane became
Brown's first oral commitment for this recruiting season. That was
six months before Texas picked up a commitment last year and eight
months before signing day.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I was going to try to wait and see what happens,''
said Doane, who is considered one of the nation's top offensive
linemen by recruiting evaluators. ``But when I went down there, I
liked the way they ran things and I liked the coaches. I also
wanted to concentrate on my senior season.''
</P>
<P>
   The commitments kept rolling in. By the time the Longhorns
opened their season on Sept. 5 against New Mexico State, they had
14 oral commitments.
</P>
<P>
   If all 18 sign, Texas will have seven scholarships to give
between now and Feb. 3 to reach the annual limit of 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a foolproof philosophy, and there is some risk,''
Brown said. ``But if you see a young man who fits your school, not
just as a football player, but in all the other ways as well, and
if he wants to come to your school and seems committed to playing
for your team, why not go ahead and make the commitment, no matter
what time of year it is?''
</P>
<P>
   It appears many players in the state agree with Brown. At their
present rate, the Longhorns could be wishing for a few more
scholarships to give out for Christmas.

<P>
   KEY QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Once a recruit commits to a school, can he change his mind?
</P>
<P>
   All commitments are non-binding and a recruit is free to change
his mind at any time before signing the national letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
   How many college visits can a recruit make?
</P>
<P>
   Recruits are limited to five official visits, meaning the school
pays for the trip. However, recruits are free to make other visits
if they pay for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   How many visits can a head coach make to a recruit's home?
</P>
<P>
   A head coach is limited to one calendar day to make an in-home
visit.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Dec. 1: Coaches can start making in-home visits with recruits.
</P>
<P>

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

IT'S AN EARLY SPRING  
 STRENGTH COACH KEEPS D-BACKS FIT IN OFF-SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Below ground, in the cool concrete tunnels of Bank One
Ballpark, the snakes are not hibernating.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks already are preparing for next spring and
summer, their second in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of strength and conditioning coach Jeff
Forney, about 10 players come in virtually every day to mold
themselves into shape. And players who live outside Arizona aren't
gathering mold. They know what is expected of them.
</P>
<P>
   They have general programs geared to their positions, and most
have specific routines that are tailored to fit their individual
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they weren't doing it, it would definitely show when they
reported to camp,'' Forney said. ``My wrath has little to do with
it. A lot of these guys could lose a job if they're not prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the end of the season, Manager Buck Showalter sat
down with Forney and members of the training and medical staffs to
discuss each player.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where Jeff's job starts,'' Showalter said. ``In many
ways, his job is more important now than it is during the season.
Baseball is such a stamina sport . . . the fact that we play every
day makes it essential that these guys build and maintain
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Forney played as an outfielder in the Cincinnati Reds chain for
six years and was a coach at Notre Dame and Arizona State before
joining the Diamondbacks organization in 1996. That experience
makes him valuable, Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can identify with what the players are going through,''
Showalter said. ``He knows when to back off and when to push.''
</P>
<P>
   The local players coming in include pitchers Andy Benes, Ben
Ford, Bryan Corey, Willie Banks and Chris Michalak. Recently signed
middle reliever Greg Swindell has joined the group. Third baseman
Matt Williams and first baseman Travis Lee participate.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Bernard Gilkey, who is recovering from corrective
laser surgery on his eyes, has been in but went back to his home in
the St. Louis area. He is expected to return shortly after the
first of the year, and others such as infielder Jay Bell are
expected to arrive. Showalter said Forney has gone to Tampa on two
occasions to work with Bell, and Bell is considering a permanent
move here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is strong in April. We want to try to make sure that
these guys have something left in September and October,'' Forney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the players took the month of October off and started to
work back into shape about three or four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Damian Miller, who lives in LaCrosse, Wis., said he
tries to follow Forney's program as closely as possible. He lifts
weights, rides a stationary bike for cardiovascular exercise and
plays an occasional game of basketball.
</P>
<P>
   These days, much of his time is spent building a new home for
his wife and young daughter, helping his uncle with whatever is
needed. Miller also has done some hunting, which helps the legs, or
so one would think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were deer hunting and this buck practically jumped right
out in front of us,'' Miller said. ``I was running, chasing him up
a small hill and I thought I was going to have a heart attack. That
shows how quickly you can get out of shape. But I'm getting back
into it now. It's exciting for us catchers because we've added a
few quality pitchers (Swindell, Todd Stottlemyre and Armando
Reynoso) that should help us out a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's running mate behind the plate, Kelly Stinnett, is
excited, too, but he has to maintain a more deliberate pace as he
recovers from arthroscopic surgery to remove debris from his right
knee. The surgery was performed shortly after the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do some (weight) lifting and a little bit of running for
about two hours and another hour of rehabilitation,'' said
Stinnett, who lives in Lawton, Okla. ``Jeff sent us some videotapes
reminding us of the proper way of doing the exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett also is maintaining dexterity in his hands by changing
diapers for his second son, Alex, who was born a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Forney said the pitchers concentrate on working their lower back
and legs, using dumbbells, power cords and medicine balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``And although people might not think that pitchers work much on
their upper body, we believe in working that, too, not necessarily
with muscle mass, but with strength,'' Forney said.
</P>
<P>
   Position players use a little heavier weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a good core, abs (abdominal muscles), lower back and
legs,'' Forney said. ``This is one of the more rotational of the
sports. You need to be explosive as a hitter. We can have 'em go
heavy now because we've still got a lot of recovery time.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as running is concerned, there are a lot of short bursts
and longer sprints, but not a lot of distance work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to repeat (the shorter work and weights) over and
over and over. To me, that's more taxing than running 10 miles,''
Forney said. &QL;

PATRONS OF `SPORT OF KINGS' DON'T ALWAYS ACT LIKE PRINCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Bruce Denneny, a retired Chicago police officer and
detective, begins the walk each day at about the same time and
place.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be a hurried walk, but because of shrinking Turf
Paradise crowds, due to off-track betting expansion, Denneny no
longer needs to be a Carl Lewis in loafers.
</P>
<P>
   At age 62, Denneny can afford a more leisurely pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knock on wood, but we don't get the kind of clientele we used
to get,'' said Denneny, who has been Turf Paradise chief of
security for the past 12 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Clientele is Denneny's nice way of describing the rip-off
artists that lurk in the shadows at many racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   Before Turf Paradise began expanding its OTB network several
years ago, Denneny usually could count on a thick file full of
unsavory characters by the end of an eight-month meet. Denneny now
estimates an average of only 10 such incidents a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that feed off honest gamblers stick out more
because (on-track) crowds are smaller and they are more easily
identified,'' said Denneny, who reported no such incidents last
Saturday during Breeders' Cup Day, which attracted a record crowd
of 4,734.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of people?
</P>
<P>
   ``Stoopers,'' ``10-percenters,'' ``odds changers,'' ``clippers''
and other scam artists and schemers looking to make a quick buck
off a racetrack's patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Stoopers sneak around searching for discarded tickets, picking
them off floors and digging them out of garbage cans. Although
stooping isn't a crime, most racetracks have regulations preventing
it.
</P>
<P>
   One argument for such regulations is that discarded tickets pick
up dirt, which in turn jam parimutuel machines. To prevent such
occurrences, Turf Paradise employ floor sweepers after every race.
</P>
<P>
   Another argument is that some horseplayers unknowingly throw
away winning tickets, some of which are lottery sized.
</P>
<P>
   For example, about five years ago, Maureen Boskon of Carefree,
whose adventure was chronicled in the ``National Enquirer,''
inadvertently threw away a winning twin trifecta ticket worth
$18,000.
</P>
<P>
   When she realized the mistake, she appealed to sympathetic
racetrack employees, who immediately began to search for the
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She threw it on the floor and it ended up in a garbage can,''
Turf Paradise spokesman Vincent Francia said. ``Three of us,
including (former Turf Paradise President) Bob Walker, started
digging through trash bags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, Mr. Walker found it.''
</P>
<P>
   Denneny can count on one hand the number of stoopers he has
apprehended the past several years, and none is a recent case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them one warning and tell them to go home,'' Denneny
said. ``If we catch them again, we ban them from the racetrack and
take a picture of them. We send the photograph to all the OTB
outlets and to the (greyhound) tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   So crafty have some stoopers become, they earn nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work at Delaware Park, and there was this one guy we
called `The Toe,' '' Francia said. ``He had these black pointed
shoes and he could somehow stick the toe of the shoe underneath a
ticket and flip it over without having to stoop to read it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, there were times when we'd be standing watching him
from a few feet away and he'd do it without us even knowing it.
He'd flip it over and nonchalantly glance down to see if it was a
winning ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there six years and I think we only caught and threw him
out four times.''
</P>
<P>
   Clippers, Denneny said, tear off the corners of $10 or $20 bills
and paste or tape them on the corners of $1 bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any of that anymore, either,'' Denneny said.
``About the only time you see it is at the concession stands. But
we have ways to check to make sure they're legal bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Denneny also produced a sheet of confiscated counterfeit bills,
some of which are extremely phony appearing, including an obvious
photocopy of a $1 bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ten-percenters attempt to cheat tax laws by offering to cash in
hefty winning tickets for 10 percent of the ticket's worth.
Gamblers with winning tickets worth more than $600 must sign an IRS
form. If a ticket is worth at least $1,500, it is subject to an
immediate tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have one (pari-mutuel window) for people cashing in
large tickets,'' Denneny said. ``Now you can go to any window.
That's why you don't see the 10-percenters here anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, we recognize a lot of these people. They've been
regulars for a long time, and with the smaller crowds, we spot them
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds changers, or jinglers, attempt to gain favorable odds by
dumping large amounts of money on a particular horse, then
canceling the bet at the last moment in order to make a second bet
at better odds.
</P>
<P>
   But because of advances made in electronic wagering, it's more
difficult to complete the scam.
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine with Denneny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem we have these days is with the automatic
pari-mutuel machines,'' Denneny said. ``Somebody will put $20 into
the machine, make a $5 bet and forget to punch the return balance
button.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time that is going on, someone else will be watching
this from several feet away. As soon as the gambler walks away from
the machine, the other people will come up and hit the return
balance key and walk away with the money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``See that man over there,'' said Denneny, pointing to a
sloppily dressed, bearded man standing next to a table. ``I caught
him a while back and threw him out. I told him if it ever happened
again, he's be banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a good boy since then. And that's the way we like
it.'' &QL;

TEACHER'S ZEST FOR EDUCATION WINS HER NATIONAL CERTIFICATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SHERRY JOE CROSBY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In Mary Bonenfant's classroom at Parthenia Street
Elementary School in suburban North Hills, preschoolers are never
bored, cranky or tired. They're too busy learning.
</P>
<P>
   During their 2{-hour stay in Bonenfant's class, pupils fly from
one activity to another. At one table, they practice counting to 10
by pasting lima beans on green paper pea pods.
</P>
<P>
   In another corner of the room, they cut up carrots and plant the
tops in paper cups after reading a story about the orange
vegetable. As if that's not enough, the entire class gathers later
to re-enact the story of ``The Three Little Pigs,'' complete with
reproductions of the straw, wood and brick houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to move from this class,'' said Christina Garcia,
who postponed moving out of the area so her son would not miss a
day of Bonenfant's class. ``She's so great.''
</P>
<P>
   The suburban Simi Valley resident also is one of 46 teachers in
the Los Angeles Unified School District who recently won the
prestigious certification from the National Board for Professional
Teaching Standards.
</P>
<P>
   Just a year ago, only one LAUSD teacher, Myra LeBendig, was
certified.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed dramatically last year after United Teachers
Los Angeles negotiated a contract that gives teachers a 15 percent
salary increase plus a one-time, $10,000 bonus from the state of
California for becoming nationally certified.
</P>
<P>
   UTLA President Day Higuchi said teacher compensation made the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the number of national-certified
teachers we had in this district before the 15 percent salary
increase incentive and the number we have now -- with 200 more
candidates applying for National Board certification for the
1998-99 school year -- speaks volumes about the level of teacher
compensation in general and the connection of compensation to
quality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Higuchi said he doesn't consider the 15 percent increase
incentive to be merit pay -- something the teachers union
steadfastly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pay for knowledge and skills,'' he said. ``It's not based
on test scores or anything like that. It's based on a very
difficult assessment of whether or not you're an accomplished
teacher as seen by the eyes of some very critical and demanding
teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   UTLA and members of eight other bargaining units are asking for
a 4 percent pay raise on top of a 2 percent salary increase this
year. The median teacher salary in the L.A. school district is
$44,500.
</P>
<P>
   For Bonenfant, the reward goes beyond financial gain. National
certification means she exemplifies the highest teaching standards
in the country -- a boon to her students, many of whom speak
Spanish at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a big risk,'' said Bonenfant, who had to pay a $2,000
application fee out of her own pocket. ``There was only one teacher
in LAUSD who had (national certification), and I know from
experience there's a lot of outstanding teachers out there. I was
willing to take the risk and try. That was my most motivating
factor.''
</P>
<P>
   To receive certification, teachers undergo a grueling process in
which they must document knowledge of their subject matter through
extensive portfolios, videotapes and samples of student work. They
also must complete a series of written exercises that examine the
depth of their knowledge as well as their understanding of how to
teach their subject matter to students.
</P>
<P>
   To receive certification, Bonenfant submitted six 10-page
portfolios and two videotapes, and endured a six-hour exam of
written essays.
</P>
<P>
   One of her requirements was to hold a large group discussion --
with 4-year-olds. She met the challenge by having her preschoolers
discuss, then assemble a dinosaur's nest out of a child's wading
pool, butcher paper and papier-mache eggs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy task, but you have to give it everything
you've got,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   From January through April, Bonenfant worked on her application
at home, carving out time on evenings and weekends and eschewing
get-togethers with her two teen-age daughters, Rebecca and Heidi.
She spent 400 hours documenting her work based on samples of
student work.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not only an exemplary teacher but an exemplary human
being,'' said Parthenia Street Elementary Principal Marcia Jackman,
who noted that Bonenfant also mentored 11 new teachers while
seeking national certification. ``She really sees where (the
children) are and where she wants to take them, and she devises the
best way to take them there.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, a parent volunteer, said she is impressed by the variety
of Bonenfant's classroom activities. She said her 4-year-old son,
Niko, enjoys school so much that he comes home singing every day
and has recently asked for a computer -- not toys -- this
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know preschool was this exciting,'' said Garcia, who
has worked as a teacher's aide in a kindergarten classroom. ``You
walk in the room and see the teacher is involved and the children
are involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Danna Barker, a student teacher working with Bonenfant, said she
goes home exhausted at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look around the classroom; she's got them doing something
every day,'' Barker said. ``She draws them in; she gets down to
their level.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bonenfant, a teacher since 1977, there's no other way to
reach her students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like we're just playing, but it's all leading
somewhere,'' she said while completing a three-week unit on farms.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few weeks, students have been learning about
common plants and animals found on farms. That has meant planting
beans and carrot tops in plastic cups; working on computer
programs, puzzles and games with farm themes; and reading stories
featuring farm animals, such as ``The Three Little Pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   And parents, who are required to attend monthly meetings at the
school, recently learned how to make stick horses out of yarn, wool
and heavy-duty plastic pipes. During class, the children straddle
the handmade horses in a play area made to look like a farm,
complete with its own bale of hay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so rewarding; the kids love it,'' Bonenfant said. ``The
reward is work.''

THE OUTER LIMITS OF FORGIVENESS

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
Trudy Calabrese's murderer stood in open court last week and told a
judge, ``Regardless of what my family thinks, I deserve the death
penalty.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trudy's husband, Rosario, wid owed father of two children, sat
quietly nearby, and disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he should die,'' Calabrese told me.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' he said, ``the Bible tells me so.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he paused, and added, ``Also, this is a thing Trudy would
not want. I'm sure about it. She was not such a person.''
</P>
<P>
   One day last February, the Living Springs Assembly of God
church, near 123rd Avenue and Camelback Road, got a call from a man
named John Sansing.
</P>
<P>
   He told them he and his wife, Kara, and their three children
were going through hard times and needed food. He'd heard the
church had a program that might help. &QL; 
Later that night, Trudy Calabrese arrived at the Sansings' home
carry ing a box of groceries.
</P>
<P>
   As she walked through the front door, Sansing clubbed her over
the head. The couple had been smoking crack cocaine. They bound
Trudy with electrical cord and dragged her into a bedroom. She was
sexually assaulted and stabbed, her body dumped in a shed behind
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the food, Trudy had $1.25 in her pocket.
</P>
<P>
   They took that, too.
</P>
<P>
   All the terrible details of the crime are known to Rosario Cala
brese. The suspects were quickly arrested, the knife found under a
sofa cushion.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you marry,'' he said, the sharp edges of English smoothed
over by his Sicilian accent, ``you make a commitment. I do this
same thing with the Lord. He tells me, you need to forgive, and I
do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't, I would be so angry inside, and it's no way to go
through the day with all the anger. So, I tell the Lord, `I'm
giving it to you.' And I try to go on best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days of Trudy's murder, the congregation at her church
had gathered clothes and toys for the suspects' four children. Even
now, they pray for Sansing and his wife, who's expected to strike a
deal soon with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In court last week, Sansing said, ``To you, Mr. Calabrese and
your kids, I'm very sorry. I wish I could change it, but I
can't.'' &QL; 
Rosario met Trudy in Germany. He'd moved there from Sicily to work.
She was in the Air Force. They came to the Phoenix area in 1996,
settling on the western edge of the city, in Avondale, where
Rosario plans to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our life is here,'' he said. ``We must go on. When I see this
man (Sansing) in court, I'm glad about what he said. He knows what
he did. His family is broken like my family. It's not easy for him
to go through his life with this.''
</P>
<P>
   As if it should be easy for him.
</P>
<P>
   There are times in this business when you can't help but put
your self in the place of the person you're writing about.
</P>
<P>
   I think of Rosario, a man with two kids, and myself, a man with
two kids, and I know if I was in his situation I'd spend every
spare moment plotting to kill the SOB who did this in a way more
gruesome than even he could imag ine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't forgive, the Lord may not forgive you,''
Rosario said.
</P>
<P>
   So what? he is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you never forgive,'' he said, ``you may never find any
joy. And your kids, maybe they will have no joy also.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosario and Trudy have a daugh ter and a son. The girl was 10
when her mom died. The boy only 6.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario said he hasn't spoken to his daughter about Sansing or
his punishment. He learned recently, though, that she had written a
letter to the sentencing judge, asking that Sansing's life be
spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mother would be proud,'' he told me, his voice rising with
an unexpected but easily identified emotion _ joy. &QL;

   I think of Rosario, a man with two kids, and myself, a man with
two kids, and I know if I was in his situation I'd spend every
spare mo ment plotting to kill the SOB who did this in a way more
gruesome than even he could imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you don't forgive, the Lord may not forgive you,''
Rosario said.
</P>
<P>
   So what? he is asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you never forgive,'' he said, ``you may never find any
joy. And your kids, maybe they will have no joy also.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosario and Trudy have a daughter and a son. The girl was 10
when her mom died. The boy only 6.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario said he hasn't spoken to his daughter about Sansing or
his pun ishment. He learned recently, though, that she had written
a letter to the sentencing judge, asking that Sans ing's life be
spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her mother would be proud,'' he told me, his voice rising with
an unexpected but easily identified emo tion _ joy.

WINNING IS NO CURE-ALL IN DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They entered the weekend trailing the Coyotes by a single point
in the Pacific Division, but trouble is brewing in ``Big D.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Dallas Stars Coach  &UR; Ken Hitchcock is in danger of
losing control of the players, if he hasn't already, and that one
of them confessed he wanted to take a swing at him during a recent
game.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them apparently said they don't think Hitchcock is the
coach who can take them to the next level and privately have
complained to General Manager  &UR; Bob Gainey. Their biggest gripe is
that Hitchcock has been getting outcoached and seems out of touch
when it comes to match-ups during the flow of the game. That's
debateable, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to blow up pretty soon down there if they're not
careful,'' said a source familiar with the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock is a good guy, and if a handful of renegades try to
run him out of town, it would be a mistake. But something has to
change if the problems are as bad as insiders claim.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect Hitchcock to duck and cover, though. He has slammed
him team publicly more than once this season and he won't be afraid
to trash a player or two to send a message. &QL; 
Crashing by design &QL; 
The ``National Post,'' Canada's new national newspaper, recently
brought together a five-member panel of experts from the fashion
world and had them rate the best and worst looking sweaters in the
NHL. The standard was based on ``chicness.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, Philadelphia and Los Angeles' new purplish crown logo
sweater drew the top ratings. The worst were the Mighty Ducks, the
San Jose Sharks and your Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   One of the panelists said of the Coyotes sweater: ``It looks
like a Power Rangers shirt. Far too cartoon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carolina Hurricanes didn't get good reviews either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in a hurricane before and I prefer the hurricane, to
tell you the truth,''  &UR; Suzanne Boyd, editor in chief of ``Flare''
magazine, said of Carolina's whirlish, red, black and white logo.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, consumers in North America spent $1.5 billion on
NHL-licensed merchandise this past year. That's up $150 million
from the previous year. The Coyotes, by the way, had the ninth-best
selling sweater in the league. Detroit was first. &QL; 
Who's No. 1? &QL; 
When a backup goalie is hot and gets a chance to start a few games
in a row, it can be tough for a coach to put him back on the bench.
Just ask  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld of the Coyotes, although his two goalies _
 &UR; Nikolai &UR; Khabibulin and  &UR; Jimmy Waite _ have been so hot that it
really doesn't matter who plays.
</P>
<P>
   That being said, it still can be tough on a backup. Just the
name itself implies some sort of inferiority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never put a lot of stock into No. 1 and No. 2. You're the
No. 1 guy the night you play and that's it,'' Florida goalie  &UR; Kirk
 &UR; McLean said. ``When I'm not playing, I'm definitely the No. 2 guy
because I'm not starting. But the next night, I might be the No. 1
guy again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole No. 1 and No. 2 thing gets blown out of proportion.
It always has and it's unfair. It's a tough enough job being a
goaltender, but when you get labeled as the No. 2 guy, it's an
awful feeling. You feel like you're not part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Panthers were winning like the Coyotes, McLean might feel
a little better. &QL; 
Andrei the Giant &QL; 
One of the reasons the Edmonton Oilers are flying high _ despite
the loss of center  &UR; Doug Weight to a knee injury _ is because of
the rejuvenated play of  &UR; Andrei Kovalenko.
</P>
<P>
   He has nine goals in 20 games, including a game-winner Friday
over Calgary. This is after scoring only six goals in 57 games last
season, a year in which he was a multiple healthy scratch and came
dangerously close to being an ex-Oiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, he scored 32 goals and we called him `The
Tank,' '' Edmonton Coach  &UR; Kevin Low said. ``Last year, he was `The
Baby Carriage.' '' &QL; 
Pouting Coyote dealt &QL; 
Left wing  &UR; Andrei Vasilyev, whom the Coyotes assigned to Las Vegas
of the International Hockey League during training camp, was traded
by the Thunder last week to the Grand Rapids Griffins for future
considerations. The Coyotes approved the move, which might be the
best thing for the struggling 26-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   He had three goals and six assists in 15 games for Las Vegas and
hadn't been happy since Day 1 there. He felt the Coyotes didn't
give him an honest look in camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very, very disappointed,'' Thunder Coach  &UR; Bob Bourne
told the ``Las Vegas-Review Journal.'' ``I'll never forget that
first practice I saw him skate for us. He did everything at
half-speed. He just didn't care. It took him a few games to get
over that and, in fact, I think he never got over it.'' &QL; 
The first to fall? &QL; 
It's getting to that point in the season when owners and general
managers of sub-.500 teams usually start huddling to discuss the
fate of their head coaches. Surprisingly, no bench boss has gotten
the boot yet in the coach killing-happy NHL, although a couple
firings could be right around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not,  &UR; Paul Maurice's job might be on the line,
even though he has the Carolina Hurricanes in first place in the
Southeast Division. The 'Canes, however, had dropped three straight
entering the weekend and six of their past eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always pressure on a coach when a team is going
through a slump,'' Carolina GM  &UR; Jim Rutherford said. ``People tend
to look around and speculate. December is a crucial month for the
whole team, not just the coach. It's time for us to start making a
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Said an upbeat Maurice: ``Everybody should have to live with a
noose a little bit. I think it brings out the best in people.''
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches on the hot seat include Chicago's  &UR; Dirk Graham and
the Sutter brothers, San Jose's  &UR; Darryl and Calgary's  &UR; Brian. &QL; 
Loose pucks
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix artist Todd McFarlane, creator of the Spawn comic book,
is a minority owner in the Edmonton Oilers and has shown some of
the players sketches he did for a potential third jersey the team
can wear.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, the players loved it. General Manager Glen Sather
didn't sound overjoyed. ``I'd like to see it first,'' he sniffed.
</P>
<P>
   Kaj Linna, a 27-year-old defenseman in the expansion Nashville
Predators organization, announced his retirement after suffering
his third concussion, the latest of which led to bleeding in his
brain. ``It's very disappointing,'' Nashville Coach Barry Trotz
said. ``He's someone who we felt could play for us at some point.''
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot? Paul Kariya of the Mighty Ducks is on an 11-game
scoring streak, during which he has seven goals and nine assists.
He's on pace to finish with a 113-point season.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not? Carolina center Ron Francis had only four goals and
four assists through 22 games and was a minus-7. Former teammate
Jaromir Jagr of Pittsburgh, meanwhile, had no goals in eight games
entering the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What's this? Brett Hull backing off a controversial comment?
That's right. The newest member of the Dallas Stars said the media
got it all wrong a couple weeks ago when it was reported Hull was
upset about the lack of ice time he was receiving from Coach Ken
Hitchcock. ``I didn't (complain) and moan about ice time,'' Hull
said. ``I've played more this year than I did in my last two years
in St. Louis. I'm having the time of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rumors are rampant that Colorado's Claude Lemieux will be
dealt before the trading deadline in March. An unrestricted free
agent, he would make the perfect pickup for a team wanting to
strengthen itself for a run in the postseason. Are you listening,
Coyotes? ``I don't worry about that,'' said Lemieux, who always
seems to turn it up about a dozen notches in the playoffs. ``If it
happens, it happens. I just take it day by day.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek on ending his four-game shutout
streak against the Rangers last week during a 4-2 win: ``I'm kind
of glad it's over. Now I can just forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Defenseman Eric Weinrich, recently traded from the Blackhawks
to the Canadiens in a six-player deal, comparing his minus-13
rating in the fall in Chicago to April at Augusta National: ``It
looked like I was going for the green jacket.'' &QL;

BRAVES ADD OFFENSIVE BEEF, STILL HUNGRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Atlanta Braves, fresh off their sixth non-World
Series championship season in seven years, truly seem to have
bought into the idea that they need more offense in order to win a
second World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing they were going to lose out on  &UR; Brian Jordan last week,
Atlanta General Manager  &UR; John Schuerholz bumped the Braves offer
from four to five years, matching what Baltimore agreed to offer
Jordan and essentially securing the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who have one of the best pitching rotations in the
game, bowed out of the National League Championship Series for the
second consecutive time when they lost to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a few innings here and there, Atlanta's
offense did not show up in the best-of-seven series, which led to
the Padres advancing to their first World Series since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves took criticism from many corners, including from
within their own clubhouse, for placing too much of an emphasis on
pitching. This time, Schuerholz seems to be listening.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta added Jordan, who should bat fifth behind  &UR; Chipper Jones
and &UR; 
 &UR; Andres Galarraga, giving the Braves a much better one-two-three
punch in the middle of the lineup than they've had in years.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Jordan on board at a hefty $40 million salary over
five years, and second baseman  &UR; Bret Boone acquired from
Cincinnati, the Braves insist they are not through retooling the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz would love to add a bona fide leadoff hitter. One
player who might be dangled as trade bait is left fielder  &UR; Ryan
Klesko, who has not seemed to improve through the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't necessarily mean we're at the end of anything
that we're doing,'' Schuerholz said. ``We'll continue to look at
things that might help us.'' &QL; 
Close call &QL; 
Unable to sleep at 1 a.m. (Eastern time) Tuesday night/Wednesday
morning,  &UR; Bernie Williams telephoned New York Yankees General
Manager &UR; Brian Cashman, who was staying at the same Tampa hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had turned down a five-year, $60 million offer
just days earlier, wanted to know if there was any way the club
would be willing to increase its offer. Cashman assured him there
was no way.
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, Williams asked if Yankees boss  &UR; George
Steinbrenner might be willing to be a bit flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Having been told no, Williams hung up and eventually fell
asleep, albeit discouraged and frustrated, believing his brilliant
Yankees career was truly over. After Williams woke up, he even told
a friend he believed he would sign with Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, though, at day's end Wednesday, Steinbrenner
capitulated and offered Williams a seven-year deal for $87.5
million, which brings the pair's tumultuous relationship full
circle.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it, Williams came perilously close to moving north to
Boston. &QL; 
Everywhere an All-Star &QL; 
Talk about star-studded: The addition of  &UR; Roberto Alomar to
Cleveland's everyday lineup means the Indians now have All-Stars at
every position.
</P>
<P>
   Having been selected nine times for the midsummer classic,
Alomar leads the Indians' All-Star parade. Next is catcher and
brother  &UR; Sandy
 &UR; Alomar (six), center fielder  &UR; Kenny Lofton (five), third baseman
 &UR; Travis
 &UR; Fryman (four), left fielder  &UR; David Justice (three), first baseman
 &UR; Jim
 &UR; Thome and right fielder  &UR; Manny Ramirez (two apiece) and shortstop
 &UR; Omar
 &UR; Vizquel (one). &QL; 
Strained relationship &QL; 
Reliever  &UR; Jeff Brantley, recently traded from St. Louis to
Philadelphia, didn't leave the Gateway City without taking a few
jabs at Cardinals Manager  &UR; Tony La Russa and pitching coach  &UR; Dave
Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I'm happy to be away from Tony La Russa, but
I'm happy to be away from the situation,'' Brantley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My relationship with Duncan was absolutely terrible. Whether
it was my fault or his fault, I don't know. I had a long talk with
Duncan on the last day of the year, and that was the only time
anybody said anything to me the last month and a half. I said, `Why
did you guys not pitch me for the last two months?' He said, `We
didn't purposely not pitch you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, generally considered the best pitching coach in the
majors, responded, ``All I can say is that it was not an ideal
working relationship. It wasn't because I didn't try to make it
work. The circumstances Jeff pitched under were very difficult for
him. The failures he had were very difficult for him to accept. And
naturally, when you have a year like that, you're not going to be
happy with a lot of things.'' &QL; 
A family affair &QL; 
The Boone family became the fourth to have at least four members
hit home runs in the major leagues last August when  &UR; Aaron Boone
slammed a shot off  &UR; Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron joined brother  &UR; Bret, dad  &UR; Bob and grandfather  &UR; Ray as
Boones who have gone deep in a big league game. The other families
with four home run hitters are the  &UR; Alous ( &UR; Felipe,  &UR; Matty,  &UR; Jesus
and  &UR; Moises); the
 &UR; Delahantys ( &UR; Ed,  &UR; Frank,  &UR; Jim and  &UR; Joe) and the  &UR; O'Neills ( &UR; Jack,
 &UR; Jim,  &UR; Steve and  &UR; Mike). &QL; 
On his way &QL; 
Store the name of  &UR; Mike Zywica away: It should come up again soon.
The Texas Rangers outfield prospect became the seventh batting
champion from the Arizona Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   The previous six winners _  &UR; Steve Pegues,  &UR; Scott Pose,  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Grudzielanek,  &UR; Robin Jennings,  &UR; Kevin Orie and  &UR; Brad Fullmer _ all
made it to the majors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL; 
 &UR; Wonder whether he knows something the rest of us don't: New Houston
third baseman  &UR; Ken Caminiti will not wear his customary No. 21 next
season. He's making it available in case Houston trades for another
No. 21,  &UR; Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Omar Vizquel sends his thanks: Cleveland, which just signed
 &UR; Roberto Alomar, has used 15 second basemen since trading  &UR; Carlos
 &UR; Baerga during the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback:  &UR; Dan Schatzeder.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Imagine if Roberto Clemente or Willie Stargell had
 &UR; played in this era: Pittsburgh's four-year, $16 million offer to
 &UR; B.J.
 &UR; Surhoff is the largest in franchise history. The Pirates would like
to play Surhoff at third base, a position he has manned for five
innings in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trivial nonsense: The Cincinnati Reds, the oldest club in the
major leagues, have not had a Cy Young Award winner. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL; 
San Diego, intent on keeping starter  &UR; Kevin Brown, increased its
offer to the premier free agent pitcher from four years and $44
million to five years and $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs pitcher  &UR; Kerry Wood, National League Rookie of the
Year, was given a clean bill of health on his previously sore right
elbow last week. Wood is expected to start spring training on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles General Manager  &UR; Kevin Malone has switched his
stance, declaring that only one Dodger is off limits in a trade.
Starting pitcher  &UR; Chan Ho Park, who won 15 games and struck out 191
while holding opponents to a .244 average, is the man Malone will
not trade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jorge Fabregas, the first Diamondbacks catcher, will have
$500,000 of his $1.85 million salary paid by the New York Mets, who
traded him last week to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have offered unspecified contracts to outfielder  &UR; Henry
Rodriguez, third baseman  &UR; Gary Gaetti and pitcher  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Clark. It is unclear whether the club will offer salary arbitration
to them by Dec. 7. If not, none can sign back with the Cubs before
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Remember  &UR; Josh Booty, the high school phenom from Louisiana who
took Florida's then-record $1.6 million signing bonus instead of
playing quarterback at Louisiana State? The Marlins took him off
the 40-man roster last week. Worse yet, none of the other 29 clubs
claimed him. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL; 
 &UR; Robin Ventura seems intent on getting a five-year, $40 million
contract. Seattle has talked with him and he may be willing to take
a one-year offer and re-enter free agency next year. The primary
suitors for Ventura are Boston, St. Louis and the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore is offering free agent first baseman
 &UR; Rafael Palmeiro a four-year contract in the $32 million range.
Palmeiro, eyeing deals signed by  &UR; Mo Vaughn and  &UR; Bernie Williams,
is entrenched, wanting at least a five-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Do not expect embattled reliever  &UR; Bobby Ayala back with Seattle
for a sixth season. Manager  &UR; Lou Piniella all but ruled out Ayala's
return recently with this statement: `Bobby's career would benefit
from a change of scenery. He's pitched his last game for us, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, Toronto and the Chicago White Sox are considering
signing free agent catcher  &UR; Terry Steinbach. If Steinbach, who
played for years under  &UR; Tony La Russa, joins the Cardinals, it will
be strictly as backup to  &UR; Eli Marrero.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Kansas City closer  &UR; Jeff Montgomery is in a sticky
situation. Soon to be 37, does he remain with the Royals and notch
another eight saves to reach the exclusive 300-save level or take
an offer from another club to become a set-up man and have a shot
at a World Series?
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have been asking what other clubs are willing to
give up in exchange for  &UR; Jose Cruz Jr., a onetime top prospect
whose star is mysteriously fading. &QL;

WAITING GAME BEGINS FOR UA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Some players clenched them between their teeth.
Others held them aloft. They were flamenco dancers in shoulder
pads.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Athletic Director Jim Livengood had the symbol of one
attached to the lapel of his coat.
</P>
<P>
   Roses, roses everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But were they just a bouquet for a rosy season or symbolic of a
bowl to come?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can be certain.
</P>
<P>
   There are mounting reports that Arizona, 11-1 for the first time
ever, will get a Rose Bowl bid if UCLA beats Miami convincingly
enough Saturday to stay ranked among the Bowl Championship Series'
first two teams. If UCLA falls to No. 3 or further in the BCS, it
is headed to the Rose by virtue of its victory over Arizona on Oct.
10.
</P>
<P>
   If it stays at No. 2, the Rose is open to Arizona, because UCLA
would be headed to the Fiesta Bowl's championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Notre Dame lurked as an obstacle Friday night after
Arizona's 50-42 victory over Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish played the University of Southern California Saturday
night at Los Angeles. A USC victory presumably would have
eliminated the Notre Dame possibility. Or, in Arizona's case, the
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the news reports. The Wildcats are always suspicious of
Notre Dame's influence.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Notre Dame's national following was a key reason that
ABC decided to televise the Irish victory over ASU at Sun Devil
Stadium on Oct. 10 instead of UCLA's victory at Arizona Stadium.
ABC will televise the Rose.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the suspicions are built on Arizona's history of never
having been to the Rose. The Wildcats are the only Pacific-10
Conference team without a postseason trip to Pasadena in their
record book.
</P>
<P>
   A rose is a rose is elusive.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Bowl Committee members at Arizona Stadium Friday night were
impressed with the Wildcats, who probably are headed to the Holiday
Bowl if UCLA drops in the BCS ratings or Notre Dame gets the nod.
But they weren't making any commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Arizona would be a great representative,'' Rose Bowl
Committee member Ron Okum said. ``We would be excited to have them.
But there aren't guarantees.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is left with the speculation. The Wildcats have to hope
it is accurate. There are a couple of theories:
</P>
<P>
   There's talk that the Rose Bowl will honor its historical tie to
the Pacific-10 Conference. If it didn't, the Rose would anger
schools that have been longtime partners.
</P>
<P>
   There's further speculation that Arizona's rise in the polls
will make the Wildcats difficult to snub. They figure to jump a
spot, from No. 7 to No. 6, because of Texas' victory over Texas
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   For Arizona, empty seats at home are a continuing negative. Not
even the annual feud with ASU filled Arizona Stadium. The crowd was
announced at 57,953. It was the smallest Arizona Stadium crowd for
an ASU game since 1990, when the game drew 57,112. In 1992, the
number was 58,095. In 1994, it was 58,810. In 1996, it was 59,920.
</P>
<P>
   The slight decline in crowds is tough to evaluate as a potential
factor in Arizona's chances at the Rose. It, too, is a subject for
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's game at Miami is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we have to be UCLA fans,'' said Arizona quarterback
Keith Smith, who sounded as if he would prefer a rematch with the
Bruins to wearing their colors.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins figure to be favored over Miami. They were able to
rest and heal some bruises over the last seven days, a bye week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rose Bowl needs to look at us,'' Smith said. ``I think we
showed some weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar Bowl, one of four in the BCS' mix, also had
representatives in Tucson Friday night. But Arizona's chances at
reaching the Sugar appear very unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Coach Dick Tomey believes the Sugar, in addition to the
Orange, will probably opt for regional favorites such as Florida or
Florida State. Notre Dame also has been mentioned as a possibility.
Of course, the Irish probably had to beat USC to stay eligible for
the BCS at No. 12 or above. The Irish were eighth last week.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, the Wildcats are conceding nothing if they get
the chance to play an established national power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We proved that we're one of the best teams in the country,''
Arizona offensive guard lineman Yusuf Scott said. ``We hope the
bowl committees see that and give us one of the best bowl games in
the country.'' &QL;

SUN DEVILS SEE PROMISE FOR '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, ARIZ. - Minutes after his team's defeat, Arizona State
safety Mitchell Freedman waited patiently for Trung Canidate to
finish media interviews on the Arizona Stadium field.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman, standing on the two bad knees on which he played much
of the season, wanted to congratulate the Arizona tailback and
Central High School graduate for his 288-yard, three-touchdown
effort.
</P>
<P>
   It was a defining moment. For much of the season, the battered
Sun Devils have watched teams with better health, and in some cases
better talent, steal the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to think about now, but this team's going to be in
good shape for next season,'' senior linebacker Joe Cesta said. ``A
lot of the young guys got experience this year, and that's going to
make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 50-42 loss Friday to the Wildcats that knocked ASU out
of bowl contention, the Sun Devils remain upbeat. The game was
indicative of their 5-6 season: plenty of promise but not enough to
close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the story of our season,'' linebacker Adam Archuleta
said. ``Both teams had momentum, but we came up short in the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils are optimistic because they feel the game gave a
glimpse into their future. The most encouraging sign: The old Ryan
Kealy is back.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 33 of 56 passes for 511 yards, four touchdowns and
two interceptions. In his past three games, he has put up these
numbers: 64 for 103 for 947 yards, nine touchdowns and two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to be playing with more confidence and seems more
demanding of himself and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's game, he was unimpressed that his passing yards
were the third most in school history, as were his attempts and
completions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how many yards you've thrown, if you don't win,
it doesn't mean (expletive),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy, whom Snyder oftens refers to as a tough quarterback, was
coming off arthroscopic knee surgery 2{ weeks before.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty courageous,'' quarterbacks coach John Pettas
said. ``He was able to suck it up and play through the pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy's performance came on the heels of Chad Elliott's
dismissal from the team. ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said he made the
decision after it became evident that the redshirt freshman's
interests weren't with the team anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The move will force the Sun Devils to rethink their recruiting
strategy. Home visits with recruits begin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's game also confirmed that tailback J.R. Redmond still
hasn't recovered from a severe ankle sprain. Although he gained 74
yards and scored a touchdown, he clearly is not the tailback that
started the season.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond reaffirmed after the game that he intends to return for
his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder expects to fill approximately a third of his next
recruiting class with junior college transfers, and many of those
could be on defense. The Sun Devils gave up 607 yards of total
offense Friday and demonstrated a propensity this season for giving
up big plays.
</P>
<P>
   ASU allowed four touchdowns on plays of more than 45 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the defensive struggles, ASU countered with an offense
that hung in until the end. The Sun Devils had a chance to tie the
score in the final seconds, but Kealy and wide receiver Tariq
McDonald couldn't connect in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave everything they had,'' Snyder said. ``You learn a
lot about a team by how they respond when something goes poorly. I
think we iterally responded every single time.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Snyder hopes the Sun Devils have the same fire next season
to rebound from a disappointing 1998. &QL; 
Quick hits: &QL; 
Freedman is scheduled to undergo arthroscopic knee surgery Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Cody Price had two tackles for losses, his first of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Other than 52 points by UCLA, the 42 that ASU scored Friday were
the most the Wildcats had allowed this season. &QL;

CHIEFS HIT WALL IN BIG WAY  
 SEASON FALLS APART FOR MANY REASONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY - The world's sexiest athlete was supposed to have
the Kansas City Chiefs Super-Bowl bound and 11-0.
</P>
<P>
   Elvis Grbac was going to make the maniacs from America's
midsection forget Joe Montana and finally exorcise the quarterback
ghosts of Mike Livingston, Jackie Lee, Bill Kenney, Steve Fuller,
Todd Blackledge, Steve DeBerg, Mike Elkins and Matt Blundin.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Donnell Bennett was going to step in for the owner
of Marcus Allen's North Oak Toyota and keep the Chiefs' running
game going.
</P>
<P>
   It has worked out so badly that Grbac, 1-4 as a starter, and
Bennett, demoted for Bam Morris, will be on the bench for today's
game against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be joined there by All-Pro defensive end Derrick Thomas,
who returns today from a one-game suspension but won't start. The
last time the nation saw Thomas, he was called for three
personal-foul penalties in the fourth quarter of a Nov. 6 loss to
Denver on ``Monday'' ``Night Football.'' Twice, he yanked Broncos
tight end Shannon Sharpe's face mask. He also threw a forearm at
quarterback Bubby Brister's head.
</P>
<P>
   Don't put all the blame on Grbac, Bennett and Thomas for the
team's six-game losing streak, the longest in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' said offensive lineman Glenn Parker, an
Arizona product. ``It's confusing. I've never been through this in
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Chiefs Coach Marty Schottenheimer, known for playoff
failures and regular-season triumphs. He was 94-49-1 in the regular
season entering this year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how the 4-7 season ranks in his coaching career,
Schottenheimer said, ``The fact that it's right now, and we're
enduring it or working our way through it, it certainly has to rank
at the top or the bottom, whatever the case may be.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did the Chiefs go wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Their talent was oversold. ``Sporting News'' predicted the
Chiefs would return to the Super Bowl for the first time since
1969. ``Kansas City Star'' columnist Jason Whitlock wrote the team
would finish the regular season 16-0.
</P>
<P>
   He only missed by at least seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe, we aren't as good as we thought we were,'' Chiefs
linebacker Donnie Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the Chiefs went 13-3 and had home-field advantage in
the AFC playoffs. But they lost at home to Denver, the second time
in three years they had the AFC's best regular-season record but
lost their first playoff game at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people predicted this year we'd go 8-8,'' Parker said of
``Sports Illustrated.'' ``We'd be happy with 8-8.''
</P>
<P>
   They lack chemistry. The additions of defensive linemen Leslie
O'Neal and Chester McGlockton, both of whom have had
well-documented problems on previous teams, didn't mesh with a
locker room that already had controversial figures in wide receiver
Andre ``Bad Moon'' Rison, Simmons and Morris, who has returned from
a suspension for substance-abuse violations.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this season the Chiefs have set team records for
penalties. They enter today's game with an NFL-high 112 penalties
for 953 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Things have gotten so bad in Kansas City, where pro football is
treated almost as a religion, players are worried that the
staunchly loyal fans might turn on them if they fall behind the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   During the 10 years of the Schottenheimer regime, the fans,
nearly 80,000 strong, are known for their ``Tomahawk Chop'' chants
and making the noise level the highest in the NFL, but seldom have
they booed.
</P>
<P>
   They also aren't used to watching the Chiefs lose three
consecutive home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things don't go well early and the performance is not what
the fans expect it to be, the crowd could get on us,'' quarterback
Rich Gannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Radio talk shows are lit up with calls from fans saying that
Schottenheimer has lost control of the team and should be fired.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count on it. Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt said he's not
thinking of replacing Schottenheimer, whose contract runs through
2001, or General Manager Carl Peterson, who is signed through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very, very capable guys,'' Hunt said. ``Six games does
not change a career. I think they're among the tops, and I
certainly consider them that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be kind of silly to go from when we were 4-1, when we
had tied the best start in team history, you would say, `Boy,
that's pretty good.' So six weeks later, you can't say that undoes
10 or 15 years of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitlock, the most powerful media voice in Kansas City, blames
Schottenheimer for the franchise's demise but hasn't spared
assistant coaches from criticism. He refers to offensive
coordinator Jimmy Raye as ``Dis-A-Raye.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not ``Dis-A-Raye's'' fault that Grbac suffered a separated
right shoulder in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Grbac, meanwhile, never boasted of his sex appeal. ``People''
magazine gave him that title.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, a fifth-year pro, was supposed to be chairman of the
running back by committee. But he didn't tell the team to bypass
signing free agents Robert Smith, Natrone Means or Raymont Harris.
</P>
<P>
   The running game is 24th in the league, four spots behind the
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas had a meltdown against the Broncos, but he wasn't alone.
Linebacker Wayne Simmons was fined $7,500 by the NFL for slamming
Brister to the ground with unnecessary force. A day later, he was
released.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Schottenheimer cried in the locker room, said he
was embarrassed and humiliated and apologized to the community.
</P>
<P>
   Chiefs fullback Tony Richardson told ``USA Today,'' ``I've been
here four years, and this is the first time I've ever felt like
just crawling out of this locker room.'' &QL;

PLUMMER BECOMES THE TALK OF THE NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY - The crowd at Arrowhead Stadium might have risen
and cheered him as Jake Plummer ran onto the field this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   It no doubt would have been an emotional afternoon for him,
starting for the Kansas City Chiefs against the team that leases
the stadium where Plummer played in college.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs wanted Plummer. And he felt very much at home with
their coaching staff, whom he got to know when they coached his
team in the Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ```Leading up to the draft,'' Plummer said last week, ``I
thought they would be the team I'd go to. They were definitely one
of the teams I wouldn't have minded going to play for.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the Chiefs had a change in plans. They signed
unrestricted free-agent quarterback Elvis Grbac for the 1997
season. They already had Rich Gannon, who has emerged as their
starter.
</P>
<P>
   So the Chiefs became another team that really liked Plummer but
didn't pull the trigger in the 1997 draft. San Francisco is
another.
</P>
<P>
   And the rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer likely will get a rather frosty reception when he runs
onto the field this afternoon as the starting quarterback for the
6-5 Cardinals, who have won three of four and are in the middle of
the playoff race, to face the 4-7 Chiefs, who have lost their past
six and surprisingly aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has a quarterback controversy. The players seem more
comfortable with Gannon. The coaches like Grbac. Gannon is back in
the lineup today.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cardinals, who jumped at the chance to draft
Plummer in the second round in 1997, have no quarterback
controversy, although it took a turnaround by Plummer in the past
four games to head one off.
</P>
<P>
   He was struggling early while getting to know new offensive
coordinator Marc Trestman and his offense. Plummer made bad reads,
threw interceptions, took sacks. Worse, the trademark qualities
that made all those coaches salivate over Plummer before the draft
disappeared. He was lost, and many fans believed the Cardinals
might be better served by benching Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   Since halftime of the Nov. 1 game at Detroit, though, both
Plummer and the offense have thrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having put this offense in at Detroit last year, I'd gone
through the same process,'' Trestman said. ``We were very slow to
start, but as the season went on, it kicked in, and we got better.
At San Francisco, we were notoriously slow starters, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the difference has been Jake's familiarity with the
offense, being more relaxed, more sure of himself on the field.
That has enabled all his intangibles to come out more.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came during the bye week. The Cardinals got
injured left guard Chris Dishman back. That helped the running
game. The threat of the run enabled the line to give Plummer better
protection. Plummer has made the most of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake has just been Jake,'' said offensive tackle Lomas Brown,
one of the team's co-captains. ``He's been making plays, doing
things to get us over the hump, doing what it has taken for us to
win.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people blamed him for our slow start. But you have to
realize that he was in another new offense, and there was a lot of
pressure that was put on him _ everything from building a stadium
and saving the NFL for an entire city to taking us to the playoffs.
That's a lot on anybody, especially a young guy like Jake.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown gives Plummer credit for not making excuses along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now things are starting to jell,'' Brown said. ``He's looking
more and more like the quarterback everyone wanted him to be, and
we're looking more and more like the team we thought we were going
to be at the beginning of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Plummer threw a club-record 15 successive pass completions in a
comeback win over Washington three games ago. The next week, his
465 passing yards nearly pulled the Cardinals out of a 28-0 hole in
a 35-28 loss to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Plummer directed the Cardinals to a 31-0 first-half
lead and a win over the Redskins in a rematch.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since the bye, the Cardinals have taken the league
lead in red-zone scoring, validating both Plummer and an offensive
line that many believed was among the league's worst.
</P>
<P>
   Trestman was confident enough in the group to add a no-huddle
wrinkle to the repertoire. Plummer took the Cardinals on touchdown
drives in both series that it was used.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people around the league are sitting up and taking notice,
not of the defense that is loaded with first-round draft picks and
was drawing the early-season raves, but of Plummer and his
production with the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to be right in foreshadowing or whatever,'' Redskins
Coach Norv Turner said. ``But you knew Jake was going to come out
of it. Young players go through some peaks and valleys. I would
prefer for him to wait another week until after we played him. He's
a heck of a football player.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a talented group of football players with him, too. The
receivers, the runners, the quarterback, the offensive line played
extremely well in our game, played well against Dallas. So you knew
the ability was there. You just wait for them to come together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they've added the no-huddle. It's a great change-up.
Obviously, it does fit Arizona's personnel because they can spread
you out and throw the ball around.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo, the Cowboys' defensive coordinator, was the first to
be victimized by Plummer in the no-huddle. Campo breathed a sigh of
relief after Plummer shredded Campo's secondary in the comeback
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're better because their quarterback is better,'' Campo
said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys cornerback Deion Sanders came away describing Plummer as
``a special quarterback'' who has many traits that Hall of Famer
Fran Tarkenton had.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins cornerback Darrell Green is equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my own guys on the sideline when we were playing them,
`This young guy is just incredible. He is just such a competitor,'
'' Green said. ``I have always been a player who appreciates my
opponent. I'm going to fight as hard as I can to beat him, but I
enjoy the competition. And I respect great competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they used to say, `Darrell Green is fast.' Well, OK,
I am, but there's more to my game than that. They say Jake is a
scrambler, but it's not just scrambling. You have to have a head on
your shoulders to understand what's happening around you when
you're scrambling. Not many can do that. This kid has a knack for
scrambling and keeping the rest of his team in the game. But he is
more than just a scrambler, he is a complete ball player. And he's
only a kid. I think the future looks good for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Many fans believe Plummer is better on the move, but his
long-term future is dependent upon becoming an efficient pocket
passer. That doesn't have to be at the expense of his innate
abilities, according to Trestman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake is a very diligent guy,'' Trestman said. ``He listens to
everything you say. Yet sometimes the best coaching is not
coaching. There is a chemistry involved there. I don't think any of
us want to see him as a guy who plays his career just running
around not knowing what the heck is going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of an ongoing process and we're in such early stages
in the development. I know the public perspective and perception is
that we ought to have the all-encompassing quarterback here. Right
at this moment that's not fair to Jake. He'll still go through his
days where he is not going to look like the guy he has in the last
three weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of it, Trestman doesn't want to place a limit
on how good Plummer can be, or how quickly he can get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our expectations are that he plays very well on a weekly
basis,'' Trestman said. ``We also have to be realistic. He has been
able to develop over the last few weeks. He's starting to
conceptualize. He knows where he is protected. He knows where he is
not. He knows where people are on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that has enabled him to go back and bring out some of
the qualities that the people who have watched him play over the
years down here know that he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the first to know it was Schottenheimer, the Chiefs'
coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake had a tremendous air about him, a confidence about him,''
Schottenheimer said. ``I had him rated quite high. Mechanically we
thought he was very talented. The comparisons that were frequently
drawn were to (Joe) Montana _ the quickness of Jake's setup and the
quickness of his delivery, not great arm strength but extremely
accurate, and the anticipation that I think is so important in
quarterback play _ those were the qualities that we saw in him.''
</P>
<P>
   And now that Plummer has played nearly two seasons in the
league?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were right on,'' Schottenheimer said. &QL;

CARDS CAN'T HESITATE TO PAY BEST PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All along, the Cardinals' plan for making the playoffs this
season has been pretty simple.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to come out of November around the .500 mark,
knowing they would play three of their final four games at home
against weaker competition.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens today in Kansas City, the plan has
worked almost to perfection for the Cardinals, who are 6-5 and in
line for the third wild card spot in the NFC playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But as young as the Cardinals are, the team shouldn't be a
one-year wonder, even though next year's schedule won't be loaded
with fifth-place weaklings.
</P>
<P>
   They have a second-year quarterback in  &UR; Jake Plummer, whom one
national publication described this week as the best player to come
into the league at that position since  &UR; Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   They have the NFL's youngest defense, and it should only get
better, especially once the right cornerback and free safety spots
are stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's draft should pay big dividends because the Cards
have two first-round picks (their own and San Diego's) and could
have several compensatory picks after losing  &UR; Michael Bankston,
Eric Hill,
 &UR; Kevin Williams, Brent Alexander and  &UR; Jeff Feagles through free
agency during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   But some dark clouds are hanging over them because of the lack
of foresight by the front office.
</P>
<P>
   Outside linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller should have been signed to an
extension last spring. It would have cost the team about $4 million
a year. Now, it will cost $5 million to $5.5 million a year, plus a
signing bonus as high as $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals won't lose Miller. They will slap the franchise
tag on him if they don't re-sign him before mid-February. If he's
still unsigned when free agency begins, things could get messy.
Miller will hold out, as will middle linebacker  &UR; Ronald McKinnon, a
restricted free agent, if they don't get fair-market deals.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon's contract already should have been done. The same goes
for wide receiver  &UR; Rob Moore, who will be in big demand if he's
still available as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 players have signed extensions or renegotiated
deals since the beginning of the season. Unfortunately, the
Cardinals haven't participated in the signing frenzy. It's not for
a lack of trying. They just don't get serious until a gun is
pointed at their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few other suggestions to make the team a consistent
winner:
</P>
<P>
   Re-sign left offensive tackle  &UR; Lomas Brown as protection until a
young tackle is groomed to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Spend two of your first three draft picks on offensive linemen.
Use the other on a speedy wide receiver or a cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Go after a defensive back in free agency and make sure you get
him. Finishing runner-up for  &UR; Brock Marion and  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Carrier the past two years won't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be chintzy in re-signing defensive tackle  &UR; Mark
 &UR; Smith. He's the most underpaid starter on the team and deserves
more than just the tender. Sure, you hold his exclusive rights, but
that doesn't mean he should be deprived of a fair deal.
</P>
<P>
   Find a blocking fullback in the draft. How many years are you
going to vow to get one?
</P>
<P>
   Get all of this wrapped up by mid-April, just in time for a vote
on a new stadium. &QL; 
Aiming for perfection &QL; 
Finally, a member of the Denver Broncos has acknowledged he is
thinking about an unbeaten season.
</P>
<P>
   Middle linebacker  &UR; Glenn Cadrez said it is on his mind as the
Broncos try to improve their record to 12-0 tonight at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to fool anybody,'' Cadrez said. ``I'm looking at
undefeated, and I want it. I want it bad. I want this roster in
Canton (Ohio, the site of the Pro Football Hall of Fame) as the
only 19-0 undefeated team. There's no avoiding it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I sit here and blow smoke up your nose and say,
`Oh, we're not thinking about it'? Of course, we're thinking about
it. I can't see anybody on this team not thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing something that is beyond expectation right now.
We've won 11 games. We have a perfect record. What's next? You're
always looking for something. We won the Super Bowl last year. That
was great, but what's our next step? We want greatness. Everyone on
the team wants that.'' &QL; 
Strange homecoming &QL; 
Fourteen years ago, Colts owner  &UR; Jimmy Irsay's father,  &UR; Robert,
ordered moving vans to sneak out of Baltimore in the middle of the
night and move the franchise to Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Irsay doesn't know whether he should return to Baltimore
in disguise for today's game between the Colts and the Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' Irsay said. `` &UR; Paul
McCartney one time attended a Rolling Stones concert, third row
center in 1966, dressed as a 90-year-old man. Maybe he'll lend me
his outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   The game isn't big to most of the players on the two teams. But
it's huge to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be rooting for the Ravens as much as we're
rooting against the Colts,'' said one fan,  &UR; David Houseknecht. ``I
think the (Ravens) band should play the Colts song, just for the
hell of it. We just hope they (Colts) get their butts kicked. You
never want them to win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   One Ravens player,  &UR; Larry Webster, a native of Elkton, Md.,
knows how important today's game is to Baltimore fans. His
godmother has ordered him to ``kick the Colts' butts.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore football fans watched the Colts not have a winning
season their final six years there. They've seen the Ravens lose
the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``People act like it's a tragedy,''  &UR; Art Donovan, a member of
the Colts' 1958 league championship team, said of the team leaving
Baltimore. ``A tragedy is going to a hospital and seeing a sick
kid. Kids with cancer, that's a tragedy. You can always get a lousy
football team back.'' &QL; 
They said it &QL; 
San Francisco wide receiver  &UR; Jerry Rice has been portrayed as
selfish for complaining that he isn't getting the ball enough and
is pondering retirement. The more he talks, the worse it looks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Minnesota, and the go-to guy is  &UR; Cris Carter,''
Rice said. ``You look at Dallas, and the go-to guy is  &UR; Michael
Irvin. I don't think I'm still the go-to guy. I feel like this is a
totally different team. It's up to  &UR; Steve ( &UR; Young, quarterback) to
choose who's going to get the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Chicago Bears defensive lineman  &UR; Alonzo
 &UR; Spellman wants back in the NFL but refuses to accept medication,
which doctors prescribed last spring, for manic depression. ``I
know everything's all right with 'Zo,'' Spellman said.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Eagles Coach  &UR; Ray Rhodes on being 2-9: ``I just try
to make sure I don't have glass objects and razors and stuff like
that laying around in my house.'' &QL; 
ON THE RISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; San Diego Chargers: Interim Coach June Jones is a good guy doing a
good job. He's 3-2 since replacing Kevin Gilbride. They are playing
the best defense in the NFL, allowing teams only 255.7 yards per
game. They haven't led the league in defense since 1965, and that
was in the American Football League. They already have 30 sacks
after finishing with 27 last season. If quarterback Craig Whelihan
keeps winning, rookie Ryan Leaf might stay on the bench. They've
even survived a season-ending injury to running back Natrone
Means. &QL; 
GOING SOUTH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Cincinnati Bengals: Let's see if we have this right. Coach Bruce
Coslet brings in quarterback Neil O'Donnell to replace Jeff Blake.
Then, when O'Donnell struggles, he skips Blake and promotes former
Arizona State quarterback Paul Justin. What's next? The Bengals are
going to use a practice team quarterback if Justin doesn't start
winning. They have too much offensive talent to be 2-9. Don't you
think running back Corey Dillon and wide receivers Carl Pickens and
Darnay Scott could start for many teams? &QL; 
OVERHEARD &QL; 
 &UR; New York Giants owner Wellington Mara, on the New England
 &UR; Patriots' move to Hartford, Conn.: ``I don't like to see the league
moving this way, especially moving out of the big cities. Now this
means Los Angeles, Houston and Boston would be without teams.'' &QL; 
ARE BOLTS DOLTS? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Chargers (5-6) are only a game behind the
Cardinals, who own their draft pick. That pick isn't looking so
good right now. Earlier in the year, the Cardinals thought they
might have a top-10 pick. Now, the choice could be in the teens.
It's all Leaf's fault. If he hadn't gone up to Pullman, Wash., and
terrorized the town, he'd still be playing and throwing
interceptions. The Chargers would be losing and the Cardinals would
be celebrating. Now, Jones' success leaves General Manager Bobby
Beathard with two options: Give him the job full time or try to
hire George Seifert. &QL; 
SHORT SHOTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Denver tight end Shannon Sharpe has a new touchdown dance he is
calling the ``Bucking Bronco.'' He describes it this way: ``It's
just like if you were on the back of a bull or a Bronco, and he's
bucking you and you're going back and forth. I don't really expect
to see people in the street doing it, but maybe some of my
teammates will pick it up and try it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven quarterbacks are 35 or older, and seven have been regular
starters _ Seattle's Warren Moon (42), Denver's John Elway (38),
Miami's Dan Marino (37), Buffalo's Doug Flutie (36), San
Francisco's Steve Young (37), the New York Jets' Vinny Testaverde
(36) and Minnesota's Randall Cunningham (35).
</P>
<P>
   Under Coach Bill Cowher, the Steelers are 13-1 at home in
November.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina defensive lineman Rick Terry, a second-round pick of
the Jets in 1997, was asked to describe Jets Coach Bill Parcells in
one word. He paused 12 seconds and then said, ``Dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' Young, on Thanksgiving growing up in Greenwich,
Conn.: ``Some of the best Thanksgiving football ever played was in
my back yard _ no helmets, lots of bloody noses.'' &QL;

LEHMAN, O'MEARA CASH IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA, Calif. _ Tom Lehman said he can't throw a baseball
and has trouble lifting his right arm above shoulder level, but he
can play golf.
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Meara, Greg Norman and Fred Couples found out just how
well he can play during Saturday's first day of the Skins Game at
Rancho La Quinta Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman and O'Meara tied with $150,000 in winnings; Norman and
Couples were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who said he separated his right shoulder while playing
with his children during the British Open last July, will have the
shoulder operated on Monday morning in Los Angeles. He said he
can't do ``a lot of the little, every-day things'' and his shoulder
hurts even when he gets out of bed in the morning, but golf still
is not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Extended golf, that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can play good rounds, but not good tournaments,'' said
Lehman, who birdied the par-3 third hole for $75,000 and the par-4
fourth for $25,000. He ended Saturday's round with a two-putt
birdie on the par-5 ninth for another $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who has played in only 23 events this year, has saved
some of his best golf for the Skins Game, which rewards aggressive
play. Counting last year, when he pocketed $300,000, the defending
champion has 15 birdies in his last 27 holes.
</P>
<P>
   He had five more Saturday. O'Meara had two and Couples and
Norman had two and one, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing,'' Couples said. ``I felt like I had some
good opportunities. If you weren't going to get any skins, today
was a good day not to.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's back-nine skins will be worth $700,000, including
$200,000 on the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's front nine, which was worth $300,000, was a
particularly frustrating day for Norman, who hit two balls in the
water and didn't even finish the par-5 ninth hole, when he dumped
his two-iron second shot into a lake. Norman, who recently returned
to competitive golf after shoulder surgery and teamed with Steve
Elkington to win the Franklin Templeton Shark Shootout two weeks
ago, said his game is rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to get back in the groove,'' he said. ``I have to
get the timing and rhythm back... get back in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy to jump back in the saddle.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy for O'Meara, who also found the water with his
second drive of the day, but he had a great equalizer _ his
putting. O'Meara is trying a new prototype putter from Taylor Made
and has shelved his trusty Ping Anser 2 for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very close by, trust me,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara forced a carryover on the second hole when he saved par
from 50 feet, and dropped a 20-footer for birdie on the par-3
eighth hole to win a $150,000 skin, the largest ever on a Saturday
of this competition.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara also was at the center of a minor controversy on the
par-3 sixth hole, when he mistakenly picked up Couples' marker,
which was six inches away from the hole, and conceded the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, just off the green and preparing to chip for a possible
birdie, asked for a ruling and Couples' coin was replaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I fell asleep,'' O'Meara said. ``I assumed the guys were
going to give him that putt. It was obviously going to change how
Greg was going to play the hole... he wanted to make sure the putt
was good. If not, he could be a little more conservative with his
chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling is an outside agency moved his marker, so it was
put back in its original position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I messed up. It's not the first time I've messed up.''

HIGH ACHIEVER DISSATISFIED WITH PREVIOUS SAT SCORE ACES EXAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN F. SHERRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A few weeks ago, Calabasas High School senior
Yashih Wu stood in the suburban school's college resource center
and called an automated number to learn the results of her SAT.
</P>
<P>
   Yashih had hoped to improve on her previous high score of 1,480,
but could not believe her ears when the computer told her she had
scored 800 in verbal and 800 in math: a perfect score of 1,600.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Burnam, the school's college counselor, watched as Wu
burst into tears and fled her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid she had gone down,'' Burnam said. ``She couldn't
say anything. She just started to shake.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu, 17, said her reaction was due to shock and fear that it was
a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might have dialed the wrong number or something,''
she said. ``I replayed it and replayed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Wu still could not say the number aloud and
swore Burnam to secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weeks before she let us tell anybody,'' the counselor
said. ``She really didn't believe the recording. She waited for
paper confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students have achieved perfection in the standardized
Scholastic Assessment Test, which is used by colleges in their
admissions process. But Wu's accomplishment is all the more
impressive when paired with her scores in the subject-specific SAT
II tests in chemistry, advanced math and English writing: 800, 800
and 800.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a true perfectionist,'' Burnam said, ``but she handles
it beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of full disclosure, Wu did score a mere 770 on
the history SAT II test and a 750 in biology. Burnam wonders if the
score sheet Wu sends to universities will give admissions
counselors pause, because every score is marked as the maximum
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like you made a mistake,'' Burnam said.
</P>
<P>
   Wu, a resident of suburban Agoura Hills, credits Burnam and her
teachers with helping her score so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote them thank-you cards after I found out,'' she said.
``(Burnam) was just always very supportive of me. She probably had
more confidence in me than I had in myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu said she has no secrets to test-taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``My philosophy in taking tests is hope for the best and expect
the worst,'' she said. ``Taking practice tests was the biggest help
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wu particularly wanted to improve upon her previous verbal
score, so she studied flash cards of vocabulary words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I came across a word I didn't know, I'd write it down
and look it up later,'' she said. ``I crammed a lot the last few
days before the test.''
</P>
<P>
   And for that extra bit of help, Wu prayed to her ancestors
before every test and wore good-luck charms for good measure. An
incentive to do well came from a bet with her friend Steven about
whether either of them would score more than 1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to take me out to dinner,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wu's younger sister is jokingly mad at her for setting an
unbeatable family standard, and her grandparents wanted her to make
a bumper sticker touting her perfect scores.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to racking up amazing test scores, Wu also serves as
treasurer of the Associated Student Body, president of the
California Scholarship Federation and as a member of several other
campus clubs. Twice a week, to let off steam, she heads to a local
karate studio and attacks a punching bag with side and roundhouse
kicks. She has been kick-boxing since the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to get rid of stress, tension,'' she said.
``My form of relaxation is kind of keeping busy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her scores, Wu is not ready to rest on her laurels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I just have to worry about college applications,'' she
said. ``I'm still nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she remains undecided, Wu is applying to nine
universities, including elite private institutions like Harvard,
Northwestern, Princeton and Yale. She is leaning toward a career in
the medical field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grades and test scores aren't that important,'' she said.
``I'm really proud that I do get these scores. It's not an end in
itself. There's more to come.''

CACTUS STORY DIED, BUT WOW, WHAT A THORNY ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a story about the world's fattest
cactus, a really obese specimen rooted near Picacho Peak.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a reliable tip, momentous journalism plans were set in
motion. The monster would be dubbed El Gordo and crowned the Sumo
of Succulents. The thing would be declared an Arizona landmark.
Roseanne would do a show about her botanical soulmate . . .
</P>
<P>
   Oops.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out El Gordo is ``not'' the world's most corpulent
cactus.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it the heaviest, tallest, happiest or ugliest.
</P>
<P>
   Barrel cactuses grow taller and wider in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   So forget about El Gordo. This story is about the whole world of
spiny succulents. It's a compendium of facti about cacti, drawn
from experts and books.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know, for example, that saguaros are not really the
world's tallest cactuses?
</P>
<P>
   Or that John Wayne's tip _ chopping off the top of a barrel
cactus and drinking the juice _ is a recipe for swollen throats and
diarrhea, rather than survival?
</P>
<P>
   Or that the prickly pear, exported to Australia, overwhelmed the
outback, causing an environmental disaster?
</P>
<P>
   We thought not. Because few people really get to know the lowly
cactus, up close and personal.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, you like to take sunset snapshots or drive through
Organ Pipe National Monument during the bloom.
</P>
<P>
   But there aren't many who embrace cactuses, figuratively
speaking, with the affection displayed by Kent Newland, former
president of the Central Arizona Cactus and Succulent Society.
</P>
<P>
   Newland's favorite is known as ``trichocerus,'' and he raises
150 of the little spikers in a Carefree shadehouse. The attraction:
This humble plant produces the most glorious bloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're kind of like hedgehogs on steroids,'' Newland says,
proudly. ``I check on them weekends, except in spring when they
flower. Then I check 'em every day. If you miss the day, then you
miss the year. . . . They're to die for.''
</P>
<P>
   Newland talks to his spiny friends. He takes snapshots. He
nurtures them. ``People almost get fixated,'' he adds. ``It's not
drugs or cigarettes, it's cacti. Beauty is in the eye of the
beholder.'' &QL; 
SCIENCE STUFF
</P>
<P>
   Now, a brief primer.
</P>
<P>
   Cactuses are native only to the Americas, with 1,500 to 2,000
species from Canada to Chile. While most are confined to deserts,
varieties thrive in rain forests and on 14,000-foot alpine slopes.
There are more than 100 varieties in the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The tallest tops 80 feet; the shortest is under a silly
centimeter.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe the botanical origins go back 20,000 years,
though evolutionary roots remain a mystery because no fossils have
been found.
</P>
<P>
   Most folks think the cactus is unique because of prickers and
pulp. But researchers say the big difference is sex.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this inscrutable definition offered by Del Weniger,
author of ``Cacti'' ``of the Southwest'':
</P>
<P>
   ``A cactus is always a dicot, and its two seed leaves will
distinguish it at once from all those members of the lily family so
often called cacti, since they are monocots and have one seed
leaf.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: Cactus flowers have a weird ovary deep within the
flower, and the stems are loaded with unique bud points which
produce spines and arms.
</P>
<P>
   If you lived in desert sand where the surface temperature may
reach 175 degrees, you'd need an edge. And evolution has provided
cacti with a lot of evolutionary tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Weniger put it this way: ``The key to understanding why the
cactus is such a strange plant is the understanding of its major
problem and how it solves it. This is the water problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Mazier, superintendent of horticulture at the Desert
Botanical Garden in Phoenix, says the pad of a prickly pear is 137
degrees on a hot Arizona afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine yourself standing in the sun 14 hours. Hey, you'd get
hot,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with that, Mother Nature provided waxy cactus skin to
retain moisture. Spines shade the stem and defend the juicy flesh
from invaders. Pleated stems work like an accordion, contracting in
drought and expanding to store water during rainy seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In dry weather, the barrel cactus may have a moisture content of
just 20 percent. But an adult specimen can drink up to 20 pounds of
rain in a day, and increase its water content to 90 percent after a
monsoon.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider ``crassulacean acid metabolism.''
</P>
<P>
   Books and botanists use that phrase to describe how succulents
retain moisture in summertime. They inhale only at night, when the
air is cool, to reduce evaporation. Then they hold their breath
during the day, sustaining themselves on reserves. &QL; 
NATURAL HISTORY
</P>
<P>
   All of which may be very boring and technical to casual
observers who realize that a cactus is like pornography: We may not
be able to define it, but we know one when we bump into it.
</P>
<P>
   That may have occurred to Chris Columbus after he rowed ashore
at Hispanola and became the first European to encounter nature's
pincushions. And it undoubtedly occurred to subsequent
conquistadors who traipsed through Arizona cholla.
</P>
<P>
   Native Americans were undoubtedly amused. They had foraged on
cactus for centuries. They prepared tea from the flowers, wine from
the fruit. They used dry saguaro ribs for hut walls.
</P>
<P>
   One of the White man's first ethnocentric moves, upon landing in
the New World, was to toss aside Native American plant names in
favor of Greek terms such as ``kaktos'' (thistle) and
``Ellchinocactus xeranthemoides'' (whatever that means).
</P>
<P>
   By any name, they soon became a subject of European delight.
</P>
<P>
   Early explorers, ever on the lookout for treasure, were amazed
to learn that little cochinillo bugs create a royal red dye as they
suck the juice from prickly pears.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Crosswhite, curator at Boyce Thompson Arboretum near
Superior, explained the importance during a recent tour. It seems
red dye was so hard to find in Spain, and so expensive, that only
nobility had magenta clothing. After American Indians showed the
Spaniards the cochinillos, mashed bug juice became a hot item on
the shipping lanes.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1700s, New World expeditions were being launched
just for the study of cactus specimens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interest in these strange new plants grew and soon
amounted to a `cactus craze,' '' notes Weniger. ``The extent of the
`craze' is hard for us to comprehend today. By 1800 businesses were
being set up by French, Belgian and German importers to sell cactus
sent by professional collectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Cactophilia rivaled the devotion to orchids among wealthy
Europeans. But cactuses are a hardier lot, and prickly plants soon
adorned window ledges of even common folk from England to Japan. &QL; 
CACTUS NUTS
</P>
<P>
   Cactomaniacs struggle to explain the intrigue, but they seem
awed by the idea that God's most forbidding flora produce such
spectacular flowers. And they marvel at the incredible survival
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people think, `Cacti? Yuck!' '' Crosswhite says. ``But
once you stop and really look at them _ even without flowers _ they
have a beauty all their own. You have to get to know them
personally. The best thing you can do is get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosswhite calls them ``plants of iron with flowers of silk,''
and wonders why Americans take their native greens for granted.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of cactus research has been done by Europeans. The
Cactus Society of Tokyo boasts 5,000 devotees. The London society
has 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Arizona's Cactus Center Club _ one of the nation's
largest groups _ claims just 500 members.
</P>
<P>
   David Eppele, club president, says the cactus is like a prophet
_ without honor in its own land.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to concentrate on the absolute beauty,'' he adds.
``And the toughness. They wrote the book on survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Eppele, director of Arizona Cactus &AMP; Succulent Research Center
in Bisbee, is a self-proclaimed nut about cactuses. He's written
several books on the subject, not to mention an essay describing
his personal mania.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls boyhood days using a cactus spine to catch fish, and
spends his adult life raising succulents and experimenting with
prickly pear as cattle forage.
</P>
<P>
   Eppele views bulldozers as the great Satan to succulents,
scraping away cactus forests to make room for homes and businesses,
oleander and eucalyptus. He is one of many naturalists crying out
for desert plants, condemning the spread of mulberry and lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big misuse of our water,'' he complains. ``It doesn't
say one damned thing about the state of Arizona. We're just going
to have to change our plant pallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Paul Nabhan, another dedicated cactophile and author,
penned an anthem in honor of his beloved ground-huggers:
</P>
<P>
   ``Let us now raise the banner of the Spiney Revolution, one that
gives both cacti and cactus-lovers their due. And let us now praise
famous prickly pears, barrels, hedgehogs . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Reg Manning, late editorial cartoonist for ``The Arizona
Republic,'' became so smitten with desert denizens that he wrote
the book on 'em: ``What Kinda Cactus'' ``Izzat?'' Among Manning's
scientific observations:
</P>
<P>
   ``A jumping cactus cannot jump _ all evidence to the contrary
notwithstanding. It is simply a painful illusion _ the thorn is
quicker than the thigh.'' &QL; 
CACTUS USES
</P>
<P>
   Cactus aficionados like to talk about how useful the plants are.
But let's be honest: As a natural resource, they seem pretty dang
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, prickly pear slime eases the pain of sunburn, and
backpackers use cactus spines as toothpicks. But, since the advent
of Fry's and Bashas', only the prickly pear seems to have real
mercantile value. Though not yet part of the U.S. diet,
``nopalitos'' _ sliced or diced prickly pear pads, minus the spines
_ are a staple in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   David Morris, a Native American instructor at Central Arizona
College, says efforts are under way to revive the prickly pear as
an Indian food source. And Eppele says his experiments suggest that
prickly pear could become an Arizona cash crop one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proving that we can grow that plant in Cochise County and
you could make a business of it,'' Eppele says. ``We could open a
canning factory.''
</P>
<P>
   While desert rats and horticulturalists may get carried away,
even the most effete city dweller admires the bloomin' beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Each spring, botanical gardens set up phone hotlines to update
callers on blooming times. More than 2 million people visited
Saguaro National Monument last year, mostly in March and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they bloom,'' Crosswhite notes, ``it's the final,
ultimate, absolute, mind-blowing reward. They're show stoppers.'' &QL;

TAX CREDIT HELPS RICH SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHRYN CRENO AND KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free money!
</P>
<P>
   A new tax break is like a winning lottery ticket for some
Arizona schools. Too bad everyone's not a winner, say the critics.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall could easily add up to tens of millions of dollars,
thanks to a law that allows taxpayers to donate up to $200 for
extra-curricular activities and subtract the full amount from their
state income tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   It's footing the bill for field trips to California for some
kids in north Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   A Flagstaff elementary school is offering all-day kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Some students are in free after-school homework clubs in north
central Phoenix's Madison schools.
</P>
<P>
   To educators such as Matt Devlin, principal of Madison Richard
C. Simis School, the money offers ``a wonderful opportunity,''
especially for helping students at risk of failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sky's the limit out there for things we can do after
school for kids,'' he said, ``everything from chess clubs to
small-group reading programs.''
</P>
<P>
   But low-income districts are having trouble cashing in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not good public policy,'' objected Penny Kotterman,
president of the Arizona Education Association, the state's largest
teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only a stop-gap funding opportunity that will make the
inequities between rich and poor schools even worse. It is
ridiculous that the Legislature isn't providing the dollars it
takes so all schools can provide decent programs in sports, music
and fine arts.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona ranks near the bottom in state spending per pupil, and
in 1996-97, it spent nearly one-third less than the national
average, according to Arizona Education Association figures.
</P>
<P>
   So eager parents, teachers and administrators have a long
shopping list, ranging from computer clubs to field trips. It
includes items, such as extracurricular sports in middle schools,
that districts could once afford.
</P>
<P>
   And creative folks realize that equipment bought for
after-school use _ software for the math club, for instance _ can
be used during school hours, too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the credit works: Suppose your state income tax is
$300 for 1998. You donate $200 to a public school for
extracurricular activities. Your tax credit comes right off the
bottom line _ now your tax for the year is $100.
</P>
<P>
   Any individual taxpayer can claim the credit. Here's the pitch:
Why pay money to the state when you can give it to a school?
</P>
<P>
   Some districts have swung into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler Unified School District and Phoenix Elementary
School District have payroll deduction programs for employees and
any area businesses that want to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa Public Schools have raised more than $105,000, with its
program barely rolling.
</P>
<P>
   The district makes it easy, with donation cards and postage-paid
envelopes available at every school, so people can just pop a check
in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Special software lets Mesa issue receipts almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the Paradise Valley Unified School District have
donated $150,000 to their tax credit fund so far. Officials of the
34,000-student district in north Phoenix expect that amount to
double next month, when many parents will make end-of-the-year
donations.
</P>
<P>
   The money will help revive sports in Paradise Valley middle
schools, which lost their interscholastic programs to budget cuts
two years ago. Counting on support from the tax credits, the
district has a new ``festival sports'' program for any student who
wants to play.
</P>
<P>
   Many schools, though, have yet to see a dime.
</P>
<P>
   At Silvestre Herrera School in central Phoenix, Principal Evelyn
Sanchez would dearly love a few thousand dollars so more of her
elementary students could play in an after-school music program
with a member of the Phoenix Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 30 or 40 kids interested who don't have the $18 a
month it takes to rent a violin,'' Sanchez said.
</P>
<P>
   In south Phoenix, Principal Gloria Henderson just wants $1,000
or so for an after-school reading program at her Martin Luther King
School. She's hoping donations will start to trickle in next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Isaac School District in the southwest Valley is still
waiting for donations, too. Superintendent Jose Leyba was amazed to
hear how much money Paradise Valley expects to raise:
</P>
<P>
   ``Three hundred thousand dollars? What we could do with just
$10,000 _ after-school classes, after-school day care, tutorial
programs. The problem in low-wealth districts like ours is that we
don't have enough staff to free up to even research something like
this. And our PTAs aren't sophisticated enough to get such a
venture going.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so in districts like north central Phoenix's Madison, which
was the first in the Valley to launch a tax-credit donation
campaign last January, with donated help from a parent who is a
political consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Simis School already has an after-school ``homework club'' up
and running, funded with about $2,000 in tax-credit donations from
parents. The school has a total of about $11,000 so far, much of
which will be used to send kids to camp early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Savvy parents such as those in Madison realized early on that in
1997 the Legislature had tacked on the so-called ``public school
activity fee'' tax credit to a bill allowing people to subtract up
to $500 in donations to private school tuition scholarship funds.
</P>
<P>
   The private school credit is facing a court challenge, but not
the public school credit.
</P>
<P>
   For sheer hustle on tax credits, few people can beat Mike
Cromer, headmaster of South Beaver Elementary School in Flagstaff.
</P>
<P>
   He was eager to offer all-day kindergarten at the back-to-basics
neighborhood school, but most parents couldn't afford the $125
monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Working his contacts as a lifelong Flagstaff resident, Cromer
used the lure of tax credits to drum up $10,000. Most of the money
will help expand the kindergarten school day _ parents will pay $25
a month _ and the rest will go to music programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature originally estimated that both tax credits would
eat into the general fund $6 million to $8 million a year, said
Georganna Meyer, chief economist at the Department of Revenue. But
she guesses the figure will shoot 10 times higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year it could be lower,'' she added, ``in large part
due to disbelief that it's real.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no overall figures available on how much money has
been raised across Arizona. A flood of money may come in near the
close of 1998. Meyer said most accountants would urge their clients
to wait until December to make donations, reducing the amount of
time they lose use of the money.
</P>
<P>
   The effective deadline for donating money at many schools is
Dec. 18, when they shut down for the holidays. But the Mesa
district, for one, is equipped to accept checks up to Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hogan, executive director of the Arizona Center for Law in
the Public Interest, is troubled that the lion's share of the
credit money will go to well-heeled districts such as Mesa and
Paradise Valley, and not places like the cash-strapped Roosevelt
district. He has already sued Arizona on behalf of Roosevelt once
and won, leading to the state's new school construction finance
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously poorer schools just can't keep up in a program like
this, and I think most people would agree that's just unfair,'' he
said. ``These after-school programs are all programs that people
would support for schools everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan isn't sure what the solution is. But he said the
Legislature should resolve the inequity next session.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of tax-credit money moving through school coffers can
be deceptive. In many cases, parents are ``donating'' the fees
required for extracurricular activities and then getting reimbursed
through the credit.
</P>
<P>
   That can lift a big burden. The Paradise Valley district, for
instance, charges $40 per activity, with a maximum of $120 per
family. And then there are such extras as field trips to California
to learn about ocean life.
</P>
<P>
   The state Auditor General's Office, meanwhile, is watching to
make sure the money ends up where donors intend.
</P>
<P>
   School districts must follow a system that's ``as restrictive as
you could get,'' said Ross Ehrick, manager in the auditor's
accounting services division. ``They're required to spend it for
the purpose it's donated for.''
</P>
<P>
   That means giving contributors pre-numbered receipts describing
the activity for which the money is intended. And districts must
keep detailed records showing the money was used for the school and
the purpose earmarked by the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent and an accountant, Kathy Bissette is busy these days
explaining such fine points about the tax credit and urging people
to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Bissette, who chairs the budget committee of Paradise Valley's
United Parents Council, hears one objection all the time: It sounds
too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder, she said. ``It's kind of hard to believe.'' &QL;

M. DONALD GRANT, 94, CONTROVERSIAL CHAIRMAN OF THE METS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   M. Donald Grant, who as chairman of the Mets ordered the
controversial trade of Tom Seaver in 1977 and whose decision to
shun free agents at the start of the free-agent era helped send the
team on a disastrous downward spiral, died at his home in Hobe
Sound, Fla., on Saturday. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a Wall Street stockbroker for Fahnestock and Co., was
chairman of the Mets' board under Joan Payson, the owner, from the
team's creation in 1962. He held the position until he was ousted
after the 1978 season, when he was replaced by Lorinda de Roulet,
Mrs. Payson's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   With Grant as chairman, the Mets won the World Series in 1969
and again reached the World Series, but lost, in 1973. But he was
remembered more for the negative aspects of his tenure because they
involved the banishment of Seaver and the decline of the team on
the field and at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   Seaver was not only the team's No. 1 pitcher, but he was also
the player who most strongly represented the Mets. Despite Seaver's
great success, the Mets became involved in a bitter contract
dispute with him in 1977, and Grant settled the matter by having
him traded. It was a low point in the team's history.
</P>
<P>
   It was before that same season that free agents became part of
Major League Baseball, but Grant refused to lure top players to
Shea Stadium by offering lucrative contracts. He said he would put
his style of conducting baseball business up against that of the
teams that pursued free agents and proclaimed that his way would
prove to be right.
</P>
<P>
   He took that stance just as the Yankees, the other team in town,
aggressively sought top free agents. While the Yankees won the
World Series in 1977 and '78, the Mets finished in last place with
a total of 130 victories over the two seasons, compared with 200
for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Mets fans resented what they felt was the team's refusal
to try to field a competitive team and stayed away from Shea in
droves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press made such a martyr of Seaver that it killed me,''
Grant said the day he was replaced as chairman. ``I did a good job
for a long time. We won two pennants and one World Series. Now
people say I ran the attendance down, but they also forget that I
ran it up to 2.7 million.''
</P>
<P>
   From that figure in 1970, then a Mets record, the attendance
declined steadily, skidding to barely over 1 million in 1978. After
another bad season and even worse attendance (788,905) the
following season, Mrs. de Roulet was forced to sell the team.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he was no longer chairman, Grant could not avoid
suffering blame for a negative development. When the football Jets
left Shea for the Meadowlands in New Jersey in 1983, Grant was
cited as a major reason Leon Hess, the Jets' owner, was moving his
team.
</P>
<P>
   Hess particularly resented that the Mets, the primary tenant at
Shea Stadium, prevented the Jets from playing home games until the
Mets' season had ended. That stance forced the Jets to play their
first three or four games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Grant is survived by his wife, Alice; two sons, Michael Jr. and
Tim; a daughter, Patsy Warner; and nine grandchildren.

FROM SAILING SOLO TO TEACHING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tania Aebi, once the youngest person to sail alone around the
world, is 30-something now. But in spirit she is still the same
spunky, outspoken teen-ager who left a bicycle messenger job in New
York City to go cruising in exotic places.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, she has become a housewife, a student and a
mother in rural Vermont and still she sails the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life goes so fast,'' Aebi said in a recent telephone interview
from her home in Corinth, Vt. ``But it's still so much fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? As co-partner in Tania Aebi's Sailing Adventures,
the 32-year-old now organizes trips for women who want to learn
more about sailing by going on extended cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Aebi and her partner, Jill London, of Key West, Fla., have a
trip lined up Feb. 8-18 in the Seychelles, an island chain in the
Indian Ocean. And from May 15-25, their two sailboats will
accommodate about 12 women on a cruise around Greece, an island a
day. Each trip costs $1,995 a person, plus air fare. The cruise to
the Seychelles is already fully booked.
</P>
<P>
   For Aebi, the voyages offer some quiet personal time on the
water. Her life is otherwise hectic as the mother of two small
children, ages 5 and 7, and as a student in an adult writing
program at Vermont College in Montpelier.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of setting out to sea still captivates the more
mature but ever-wistful Aebi. At 18, she set out to sea alone with
a pittance of nautical savvy on a boat offered by her father with
the unorthodox challenge to sail the world. By age 21, when she
returned to New York Harbor, Aebi had garnered enough life
experiences to fill a book.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1989 account, ``Maiden Voyage,'' written with Bernadette
Brennan Bernon, editorial director of Cruising World magazine, told
the story of a 27,000-mile saga by a stubborn young girl with
little experience at sea or with life.
</P>
<P>
   The book pointed out that, in the end, Aebi unintentionally
compromised her status as a lone circumnavigator. By delivering an
acquaintance from one small island to another during the voyage,
she had not been alone after all. Still, the 80-mile glitch on her
26-foot sailboat has not spoiled the memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy that I did it,'' Aebi said about the global
trip. ``It was like a dream. At the time, I didn't realize that; it
was more like a job. But I learned a lot of things. When I got back
into society, I realized that self-reliance and self-accountability
are not that important to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Aebi is now capitalizing on the idea of taking other women
sailing. The concept of sailing schools for women became popular in
the mid-1980s when women made it clear they wanted to learn outside
of the male shadow. More often than not when they went sailing with
men, they found themselves relegated to cooking in the galley
rather than trimming sails on the foredeck, and they wanted out of
the male tutorials.
</P>
<P>
   Women seem to be dropping that kind of segregated outlook
somewhat now that more of them are comfortable at the helm, Doris
Colgate, president of the National Women's Sailing Association,
said recently. As founder of the nonprofit sailing group, Colgate
sent a questionnaire to 1,000 former boating students. The majority
of the women said it was time to move on from much of the
instructional isolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many did not feel that women's classes were that important
because it isn't the real world,'' Colgate said.
</P>
<P>
   For the early stages of sailboat instruction, however, women
continue to ask about special classes where they can learn among
themselves, Colgate added.
</P>
<P>
   Aebi agrees there is a need. She is not opposed to men on some
of her group's voyages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't boot camp,'' Aebi said. ``The women we have taken on
trips can learn as much as they want. It's about getting familiar
with living aboard a boat. Slowly, everything comes together. It's
about navigation and sail handling, cooking, engine and boat
maintenance, anchoring and docking.''
</P>
<P>
   A favorite maneuver for Aebi is when a boatload of women comes
into the dock at some foreign port. Men along the waterfront tend
to snicker as if the worst is about to happen, she said, adding:
``But we always do it right. Those guys are waiting for us to mess
up. But we don't. I love that time the best.''

LEHMAN SET FOR SURGERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA QUINTA -- Tom Lehman will undergo surgery on his right
shoulder on Monday morning in Los Angeles, and Greg Norman knows
exactly what the future holds for him.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's surgery, which will repair the A.C. joint in his right
shoulder, will not be as extensive as the procedure Norman had
seven months ago, when he had his left shoulder socket
reconstructed, bone spurs shaved away and muscles tightened. Norman
did say Lehman will benefit in the long run -- both from the
standpoint of his shoulder and state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Tom, `You'll get your life back,' Norman said after
Saturday's first day of the 16th annual Skins Game at Rancho La
Quinta Country Club. ``You don't know what it's like to wake up
Saturday morning in your own bed at home, or spend the weekend with
your kids. You have no mandate on your time ... no regimen to do
something. You control your own life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I never missed the game. I did miss the competition
... I missed these guys. Tom will find out the same thing. It will
be a very cleansing thing for him. He will come back with an
unfiltered approach toward life and the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to step away from something and look back at it.
These guys haven't been seven months away from something they've
loved for 20-25 years. It really is a wonderful thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone should do it.
</P>
<P>
   Norman also said he is eagerly awaiting the Presidents Cup,
which will be held next month at Royal Melbourne Golf Course in
Melbourne, Australia. He said the move of the tournament away from
the United States couldn't have come at a better time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was important to move, said Norman, who tops a
strong international team which also will include the likes of
Steve Elkington, Ernie Els and Nick Price. ``In the last 12 or 15
years, the Ryder Cup has risen to the next level because of the
exposure. For the Presidents Cup to go that route, I think it was
important for it to be moved away from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. has a very, very strong team. We have a very strong
team. I think it will be a very good match.

ORIOLES INCH CLOSER TO ADDING BELLE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles, trying to recover from an expensive and
disappointing season, inched closer Saturday to adding Albert Belle
to their depleted lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Arn Tellem, Belle's agent, said ``it's close,'' but cautioned
that ``a couple little issues'' had to be resolved. An Orioles
official said the two sides had already agreed to the basic terms
of the contract, five years and about $65 million.
</P>
<P>
   There was a wild-card element to the negotiations, however, and
that was Belle himself. A friend of the slugging but controversial
outfielder reiterated Saturday that Belle could still decide that
he wanted to return to the Chicago White Sox, for whom he played
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   But Tellem said he thought if the remaining issues were worked
out, Belle would accept the deal and join the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, 32, is a free agent until next Wednesday because of a
clause in the five-year, $55 million contract he signed with the
White Sox two years ago. That clause stipulates that if he was no
longer among the three highest-paid players he could be a temporary
free agent and either sign elsewhere or remain with the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   He has spoken with Jerry Reinsdorf, the White Sox owner, about
the possibility of staying in Chicago, but Reinsdorf apparently has
not agreed to make any adjustments in the contract, either by
adding money or by extending the no-trade provision beyond next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had pursued Belle in case they did not re-sign
Bernie Williams and, in fact, seemed at one point closer to adding
Belle than keeping Williams. But when the Orioles offered Belle $65
million for five years, the Yankees decided that if they were going
to spend that amount of money or more, they might as well match the
offer the Boston Red Sox had made to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Orioles as the only team still chasing Belle, who
after midseason this year batted .387, clubbed 31 home runs and
drove in 86 runs in 76 games. The Orioles want Belle's bat in their
lineup to turn around the losing season they had this year despite
their $72 million payroll, a baseball record.
</P>
<P>
   People who have dealt with Belle believe he would fare better in
Baltimore than he would have in New York because he would face less
stress. In the past, at least, fans have been able to incite Belle,
and he has paid for it, in suspensions and fines.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles' lineup has shrunk during the off season, with
Roberto Alomar and Eric Davis leaving as free agents. The Orioles
have made offers to two of their other free agents, first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro and left fielder B.J. Surhoff, but neither player
was moving quickly to accept.
</P>
<P>
   If the Orioles sign Belle, they presumably would stop pursuing
Surhoff, leaving the Mets in better position to sign him to play
left field.

SUN IS DEADLY ENEMY FOR GILBERT 9-YEAR-OLD
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
 &HT;    Between the dark and the day light, 
When the night is beginning to lower, 
Comes a pause in the day's occupa tions, 
That is known as the children's hour. 
 _ Henry Wadsworth Longfellow  
 By BARBARA YOST  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
When night falls, the Collin Cassinat hour begins.
<P>
   As other children take cover from the darkness, Collin's
playtime is just beginning. Under the moon light, he races his
bike, catches frogs, hunts bugs and exhilarates in his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine is no friend to Collin. Exposures of just minutes would
cause his skin to redden, burn and blister. An overdose would kill
him.
</P>
<P>
   Collin, 9, is a child of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Born with a genetic disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum, in
which the cells of the body lack the ability to repair DNA damage
from ultraviolet rays, Collin's best chance for survival is to
avoid all sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Windows in his family's Gilbert home are tinted and covered with
blinds. The family van is outfitted with blackout curtains. When
Collin goes outside during the day, he is swaddled head to toe in
long sleeves, long pants and a cap with a flap in the back that
makes him look like the youngest soldier in the French Foreign
Legion. He huddles under a blanket.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Cindy and Tony Cassinat, estimate their son is ex
posed to no more than five minutes of sunshine a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad'' is how Collin describes his sheltered life. Yet he's a
bright, chipper youngster with an impish personality and no lack of
friends. Two little girls have appointed themselves his escorts
between school buildings when he is wrapped so tightly against the
sun he can't see through his protective garb.
</P>
<P>
   At recess, classmates vie for the chance to stay indoors with
Collin and play field hockey in the halls.
</P>
<P>
   He admits there are advantages to having XP.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get spoiled,'' he said with a grin, ``by my teacher, then my
mama, then my dad, then my principal.''
</P>
<P>
   Collin was once invited to a sleep-over at the Phoenix Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer he went to Camp Sundown in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where
young campers with XP enjoyed indoor activities during the day and
played outside long into the night.
</P>
<P>
   But sitting alone in a darkened van parked where he can watch
his sister's soccer practice, his eyes get a bit teary as he counts
down the minutes until sunset when he can break out of the van and
run free.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:34 p.m., the Collin hour begins.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Cassinat first noticed something alarming about her third
son in February 1989. Six weeks old, Collin had been sitting
outside in his stroller, bundled against the chill. The next day he
appeared to have eczema on his cheeks _ crusty, scabby, oozing
patches.
</P>
<P>
   With a little research, Cindy learned that sunlight could help
dry up eczema, so she took Collin outside again. When the
``eczema'' spread to his arms, her pediatrician prescribed a
cortisone salve.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis: Fair Irish skin. Treat ment: Keep that boy out of the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Collin spent his toddler years covered in sunscreen, playing in
doors or in the shade. He wore hats and long-sleeved shirts. ``His
skin was always dry and cracky a little bit,'' Tony Cassinat said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Cindy read a newspaper article about Julian Nieves
Armenta, a 4-year-old Mexican boy being treated for XP at Maricopa
Medical Center and introduced at a Univer sity of Arizona medical
symposium. Multiple skin cancers covered his head and dotted his
eyeballs.
</P>
<P>
   Julian's condition, minus the nu merous malignancies, sounded re
markably like Collin's, Cindy thought.
</P>
<P>
   A UA dermatologist confirmed her suspicions. In 20 years of
practice in pediatric dermatology, Dr. Ron Han sen had seen just
two cases of XP. Julian was one. Collin was the other. Most doctors
don't see any.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 130 cases exist in the country, with an estimated
1,000 worldwide. Collin's is the only known case in Arizona, the
Cassi nats say.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme freckling and photopho bia _ severe discomfort in the
sun _ are the earliest symptoms. Those signs should be detected by
age 1 or 2; then protection can begin. ``We're talking a nocturnal
person,'' Hansen said. ``Even a minute or two of sun is enough DNA
damage to have skin cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreen is a puny weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a diagnosis, the Cassinats devoted themselves to
shielding Collin and instilled in him a sense of self-protection.
If some one opens a window or raises a shade, he'll cry out,
``You're killing me!'' Cindy said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, his cries are all too true.
</P>
<P>
   Undiagnosed and unprotected, children with XP usually die by the
age of 10. Protected, they can enjoy a life expectancy of about 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to his parents, Collin should have nearly a normal life
span, Hansen said: ``Collin will do much better. They were very
care ful.'' &QL; 
`NOT ONE TO MOPE'
</P>
<P>
   At Greenfield Elementary School, third-grader Collin blends in
with the other pupils. Only his UV-protective jacket gives him
away.
</P>
<P>
   Classroom windows are shaded, doors to the outside kept shut.
Collin spends his day inside, except for a weekly dash to the
building next door where art classes are held. That's when Diana
Hancock and Amanda Schreck guide their friend across campus. ``They
help me so I don't run into stuff,'' Collin said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he does run into stuff _ the school, a tree. Sometimes
he trips. But he picks himself up and forges on.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not one to mope,'' said his teacher, Sue Villa. ``He
doesn't feel sorry for himself. . . . He's a great little kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Villa takes Collin's special needs in stride. When the school
had its fall festival, she arranged indoor events. When the class
was man dated to clean up school grounds for a lesson in ecology,
she sent them to the cafeteria to pick up trash. She creates indoor
science projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always other ways to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Collin's future in school is uncer tain. When he graduates to
Green field Junior High School in three years, his parents will
have to evaluate the facility for safety. Are windows tinted? Will
all classes be in one building?
</P>
<P>
   The Cassinats pray the next school will be as accessible as this
one. Cindy pulls her van as close as possible to the front door at
Green field Elementary, and Collin races in. Once, when the
driveway was blocked by a van collision, she commandeered the
delivery en trance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we can continue in a normal school,'' Tony said.
``That's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   If the junior high proves unac ceptable, the Cassinats won't
hesi tate to ask for modifications to protect their son. If the
building can't meet their needs, they'll be forced to home school
him, further isolating a boy who already lives a life apart. &QL; 
A CALCULATED SCHEDULE
</P>
<P>
   The odds that Collin would be born with XP are phenomenal. To
produce the condition, both parents must be carriers of an aberrant
recessive gene. The chances of one partner being a carrier are one
in 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, fate determined that Cindy, who grew up in California,
and Tony, a native of Wyoming, should meet, marry and have four
children. And one of those children would inherit a pair of XP
genes.
</P>
<P>
   News of that genetic fluke came as a blow, Tony says.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look at you and say your son can not go outside any more.
The next day we told the kids. That was hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tony insists Collin's needs don't control their lives,
they live on a calculated schedule.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day, Cindy knows exactly when the sun sets. Collin
heads outside 10 minutes later. In the summer, that can be as late
at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   There have been just two family vacations _ to Lake Tahoe in
1996 and to Camp Sundown last year.
</P>
<P>
   While his two brothers, Chris, 16, and Craig, 12, and sister
Courtney, 8, are hooked on sports, Collin shines in the chess club.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a restaurant before sunset means wrapping Collin ``like
a soft taco,'' Cindy said, and ignoring the stares of patrons. The
explanation, when asked for, is that the boy is allergic to the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Collin's diagnosis, the family moved from a
1,100-square foot house into a new 4,000-square-foot house, quadru
pling Collin's indoor world. With living room furniture kept
sparse, he was allowed to roller skate inside until the wheels
became too dirty. Tracks in the carpeting were a small price to pay
to let a boy burn off energy.
</P>
<P>
   But Collin still lives life upside down. When other children are
playing outside, he's peering at them from his front window. When
he's outside, his friends are already in for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sunshine world out there,'' Tony said. ``People open
their windows and let the sun shine in. This goes against what
society is brought up with.''
</P>
<P>
   Because XP is so rare, little scientific research is being done.
For the time being, treatment means vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word is `no sun.' We make judgment calls on what is worth
while,'' Tony said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cassinats are scrupulous about checking Collin's skin for
suspicious spots. So far, he's had more than 30 removed; 20 were
cancerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' Cindy said, ``but we wish they wouldn't
keep popping up.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Collin is lucky. Some chil dren with XP suffer blindness,
hearing loss, neurological impair ment and mental retardation, al
though the connection is unclear. Despite some minor learning disa
bilities, Collin is smart and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   For a boy whose enemy is the sun, Arizona would seem the evil
empire. In truth, the Valley of the Sun is Collin's best friend.
Phoenix has no more ultraviolet rays than cloudy Seattle. Clouds do
not block UV rays.
</P>
<P>
   And where else could a boy play outside after dark all year
round? Not Minnesota. Not North Dakota. &QL; 
SUPPORT GROUP OF 1
</P>
<P>
   Because Collin is the only child with XP in Arizona, there is no
one with whom to commiserate. He is a support group of one.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy said, ``You're looking at XP-AZ right here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet (www.xps.org/) is the Cassinats' link to XP parents
across the country. At Camp Sun down, they learned families cope as
best they can with the rare illness, keeping abreast of the few
develop ments in the field.
</P>
<P>
   A UV monitor, which detects ultraviolet rays, can alert parents
to dangerous levels of sunlight. But it is an expensive tool the
Cassinats can't afford.
</P>
<P>
   Another promising innovation is a pint-size space suit developed
by NASA. When perfected, it will shield children from UV light out
doors. Although several models have been constructed, however, the
XP Society has not yet endorsed any design, believing current suits
offer only a false sense of security.
</P>
<P>
   Collin tries to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants one,'' Cindy said. ``He asks for one all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing outside during daylight hours is still only a dream for
Collin.
</P>
<P>
   The reality can break a mother's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get down,'' Cindy said, ``but I can just start
thinking about him and start crying.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never ask, `Why us?' '' she said, with a smile she's been
practicing for a decade, sustained by the words of a friend who
told her, `` `He's here for a very important reason. He has this
disease for a very important reason.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After sunset, those reasons mean little to a boy at play. Collin
has captured a toad, and in his victory, the child of the night
comes alive. &QL;

<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Mike Milbury shuffled the Islanders' forward
lines and scratched two ineffective wings Saturday in an effort to
get more production from an offense that has suddenly slumped.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work. The Islanders got a decent performance from
their goaltender and a better-than-average effort from their
defenders, but the slumping forwards failed to cash in on many
chances in a ho-hum 3-1 loss to the Carolina Hurricanes at Nassau
Coliseum. It was the Islanders' second straight defeat and their
fifth in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't score,'' said Milbury, the Islanders' coach
and general manager. ``Early on, we needed a goal and we couldn't
put it in. On not one line did we have enough offense to get
ignited.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders (10-13), who were playing their third game in four
days, were competitive early but disintegrated in the span of 7
minutes 26 seconds in the second period. During that stretch the
Hurricanes' Kevin Dineen, Sami Kapanen and Keith Primeau scored
against Tommy Salo. The Islanders, who got a third-period goal from
Sergei Nemchinov, lacked the offensive punch to come back either on
the power play (where they were 0 for 3) or at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   Salo had 20 saves and Trevor Kidd made 21 stops for Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There are many underachieving Islander forwards, but at the
center of the team's woes are the two players Milbury scratched
Saturday: left wing Ted Donato and right wing Jason Dawe. Dawe has
not scored a goal since Oct. 29 and has just 3 points in his last
11 games. Donato, who was acquired from the Bruins earlier this
month, has no goals and four assists in nine games with the
Islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Donato has been lousy since he got here; Dawe decides to play
when we put him on a line,'' Milbury said, suggesting that Dawe
puts forth more effort when he is on a scoring line.
</P>
<P>
   Mariusz Czerkawski and Robert Reichel generated some chances,
registering 11 shots on goal between them. But hitting the goalie
or the post, as Czerkawski did in the second period, doesn't count.
Mike Watt and Joe Sacco did not sniff the net, while Trevor Linden
shot on goal only once.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Bryan Smolinski, a versatile forward,
sustained a bruised shoulder early in the third period after
colliding with the boards and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 12,472 fans at Nassau Coliseum revived the ``We want
Ziggy'' chant in the third period. It had not been heard here since
the first week of the season. The Long Island fans might not have
missed Zigmund Palffy, the Islanders' unsigned wing, while the team
was winning. But Saturday they called on the team to sign him.
Palffy's contract dispute with the Islanders is in its second
month. Undeniably, the free agent Palffy, a three-time 40-goal
scorer, would help the Islanders' undermanned offense.
</P>
<P>
   Dineen scored at 3:07 of the second period, launching a perfect
shot through a screen and over the shoulder of Salo. Kapanen made
the score 2-0 at 6:25 with another good shot, backhanding the puck
off of the far post on a semi-wraparound. And Primeau tallied at
7:26 on the power play, knocking in a rebound after defenseman
Scott Lachance failed to clear the puck. Nemchinov put a backhander
from the slot past Kidd at 14:02 of the third period for the
Islanders' lone goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to generate more offense,'' said Linden, the
Islanders' captain. Then, referring to Palffy, Linden said:
``Certainly when you have a guy like that in the lineup that can
score and make things happen, it's obviously a huge advantage.
There are a handful of players that are in his league
offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   SLAP SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman KENNY JONSSON, who sustained a concussion last week,
missed his third game Saturday and was questionable for Wednesday's
game against the Rangers at Nassau Coliseum. ... The Islanders
recalled the 6-foot-9-inch defenseman ZDENO CHARA and the enforcer
STEVE WEBB. Both made their season debuts.
